# A
						LETTER OF THANKS.
## An Expression of the Gratitude of the University to the Donor of Our New Library. 
### 
The following letter expressive of
the appreciation and gratitude felt
by the faculty and students of
Stanford toward him whose name
our new Library building bears
has just been sent to Australia.
While the signatures are few, the
sentiments expressed are the senti
ments of the many:
Leland Stanford Jr. Univ.,
February 28, 1899.
Mr. Thomas Welton Stanford â€”
Dear Sir: The progress of the
Library building for this Univer
sity has occasioned a feeling among
its officers, its students, and its
friends that they should unite in
an expression of their appreciation
of your efforts in its behalf.
We regret that we are unable to
manifest our gratitude to you in
person. We regret that you are
not able to see the building you are
erecting, and that you cannot join
in the life of the institution. If
you were here we could make a
more adequate acknowledgment of
your beneficence than is afforded by
this letter. But repeated gifts may
dull the sense of gratitude, and to
the end that we may not forget we
wish to make some record of your
services.
We are now come to the time
when we can feel that this institu
tion will endure. When your
brother passed from this life there
were some who felt justified in ad
vising that its doors should be
shut. We are informed that your
generous action with regard to the
large legacy to you, and the help
and encouragement you gave to
her who at that time was in such
sore need, were a great part of the
financial and moral support which
bore the institution through that
crisis.
In the struggle that then fol
lowed, when help was thrice val
ued, how shall we recount the ben
efactions from your hand? They
must remain a long list of unpub
lished acts of generosity.
The library building that bears
your name as a memorial of the
giver may outwardly show your
beneficence; but it is for us, who
know of your encouragement in
time of need, of your words in our
behalf to those about you, and of
your continued acts of unseen giv
ing, to express to you our grati
tude, and that of our students and
of our institution.
