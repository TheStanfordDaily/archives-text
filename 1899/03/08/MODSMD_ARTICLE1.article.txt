# THE 						BIG CONCERT.
## An Excellent and Varied Program Arranged and Tickets Selling Fast. 
### 
\Ve publish today the program
for the big concert to be given in
the chapel next Friday evening
at 8 o'clock.
It shows a variety winch is not
only flattering to us as members of
the University which the different
•organizations and individuals rep
resent but insures an evening of
pleasure in which there will be not
a moment to drag.
The numbers 011 the program in
which t lie men's and women's
clubs appear together on the stage
will, on account of their novelty,
undoubtedly attract the most at
tention. The Girls' Glee has been
making rapid progress, and as its
recent appearance in l'alo Alto at
the vaudeville show proved, is in
excellent shape. Since that time
the club lias been practicing faith
fully and has added to i'.s repertoire.
The Ladies' Mandolin Club has
been in existence for several years
and has many times proved its
ability. The three Varsity clubs
have been working hard ever since
the announcement of the concert
and are prepared with new music
to maintain their former high
record.
The three individual entertain
ers are well known to the audience
they will entertain. All that need
be said is that each has something
new for the occasion.
This is the program:

Seats were put on sale at the
postoflice this noon and during the
afternoon nearly all the seats in the
reserved section have been sold.
This section will be extended fur
ther bark and as many seats will
be reserved as the demand requires.
It is very probable that every seat
in the chapel will be sold and re
served before the time of the con
cert. In that case there will be 110
seats left for general admission
tickets. Indeed there is a possibil
ity that not everybody who wishes
will be able to gain admittance to
the chapel.
