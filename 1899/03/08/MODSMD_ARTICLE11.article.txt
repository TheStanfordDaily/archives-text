# REES' LECTURE.
## He Declares That the Treatment of Our Soldiers is Unworthy Our Civilization. 
### 
Mr. Rees, one of Stanford's men
in Company K, First California,
spoke last evening on the subject:
"Military Organizations and Dem
ocracy." What Mr. Rees said was
based on his knowledge of the or
ganization of the American army,
and of its actual operation, lie
spoke with unusual force. His ar
gument was clear, strongly put,
with a rare power of conviction in
his manner, utterly free from the
curb of "policy" and bombastic cir
cumlocution. Another distinctive
feature of Mr. Rees' style is his
mastery of telling wit. And
whether the argument met ap
plause or doubt, it compelled a thor
ough respect.
In introduction was given a brief
review of the evolution of military
organization. This assumed society
to be under the man strongest to
control, with absolute power. So
ciety in its civil life is far removed
from the primitive model. In its
military organization the same an
cient relations are made to hold. A
private is under officers and is al
lowed little more privilege of intel
ligence than in the old times was
allowed the common tribesman.
The relation between the men of
the ranks to their officers is yet sub
servience, as to lion tamers.
Therefore militarism is fundamen
tally usurpatory. It usurps dig
nity, intelligence, and individual
ity. The soldier is allowed no right
to think or act, even in matters
wholly unessential to order, it is
not that the private expects in the
army the freedom of civil life. But
the American soldier does ex
pect a degree of freedom that shall
accept his superiority to the mental
weakling of the primitive army.
The American soldier has been
trained in a democracy. He is un
able not to think. The military
organization does not allow this.
He is forced into a routine of camp
life destructive of those elements of
character on which our nation is
based.
Vet in comparison with men of
European armies, the independence
of the American soldier has placed
him in many ways above the for
eigner of the same rank. The
American soldier complains not lie
cause he is treated worse, but be
cause his civil life has taught him
to demand more. The basic fault
of our army organization today is
this: We are using a medieval
army to control a twentieth cen
tury people.
Our army is formed from men of
this twentieth century. Its soldiers
can not be forced to submit unre
sistingly to officers appointed solely
through political favoritism; of
ficers that in many cases disregard
their duties to the soldiers and rig
idly exact an excessive duty from
their men. Mr. Kees here inter
jected, " By no means are all the
officers of this type," and dwelt
with warm applause upon several
of Manila's army heroes. Provis
ions and equipments are criminally
neglected. Nine out of ten deaths
in the army have come through
negligence of superior officers. The

proof of the private's resentment
is shown in the numbers unwilling
to re-enlist.
Evil in the army means evil to
the government. Armies give the
reflex of the condition of the peo
ple. Imperialism tends to military
usurpation. Even in this brief
time its effects are to be noted in
the American commonwealth.
Wheeler, a general of the army, is
allowed to retain his place in the
House with civic power. The talk
of Dewey for President shows the
readiness of the public mind to
commit the error of placing a mili
tary head at the head of a democ
racy. Militarism is forcing in the
far background the developments
necessary to a logical expansion.
Immigration is again unchecked.
Agriculture and internal exploita
tion is left almost without govern
ment attention.
Hut if the army is taken from
a republic, the army spirit is dem
ocratic. The American army is
made of thinking men, men with
power of self-direction and initia
tive. There is equality of intelli
gence between officers and men. In
foreign countries the soldiers are
molded by the oHicers; in America
the officers are molded by the men.
In foreign armies the general leads
his soldiers to victory; in the Amer
ican army the soldiers lead their
generals to victoryâ€”that is, if the
general is not too far in the rear to
get up in time for the glory.
Progress in society has been
through a breaking-down of classes.
As the lower raised the power of
the upper was diminished. The
law has been the vindication of one
class by the pulling down of the
other. So it shall be with the
American army. The private shall
be allowed to use more freely his
judgment, to exercise his individu
ality. Just so far shall the power
of the officers be curtailed. The
American soldier has been trained
in the democracy to this trust. He
deserves it and he knows how to use
it. The American soldier is the
best in the world. No force of equal
number can stand against him an
hour, or half an hour.
''The ultimate army will be one
of liberation, not of subjugation.
It will spread justice, not dominion.
It shall be democratic. Officers
shall be chosen by competitive ex
aminations, and in the final rank
ing the soldiers shall have voice,
naming the man they want. Of
ficers must be for the soldiers, just
as government is for the people.
There shall be no concentration of
authority except in time of actual
fighting. At all other times a sol
diers' congress shall manage the af
fairs of the army. Court-martial
shall be abolished and trials of sol
diers shall take place in civil courts.
By all means, the President shall
have no power to make a single ap
pointment. There shall not be an
officer who shall not have risen
from the ranks. A despotic army
is absolutely impossible tothedem
ocratic men in the army of the
United States. In order to preserve
the democracy of our institutions
we must either have no army at all,
or else bold a small standing arm}'
which shall be maintained on dem
ocratic principles.
