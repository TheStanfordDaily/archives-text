The Faculty Committee on Stu
dent Affairs has had occasion this
year to deal severely with several
students who have been found
guilty of phigiarism in English 8
and other courses where reports are
submitted. Such an act is considered
intellectual prostitution by the com
mittee, and it is never repeated by
one once detected in it. We do not
believe in warning those who will
fully indulge in such practices—
those students have no place at
Stanford —but as a word of advice
might suggest the consequences of
these acts to any who have not seri
ously considered the matter, we
will state that they are more severe
than students generally care to in
cur.
