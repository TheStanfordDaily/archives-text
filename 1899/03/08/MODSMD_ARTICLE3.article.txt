# Zoology Club.

### 
On Monday evening the Zoology
Club met upon invitation of l'ro

fessor V. L. Kellogg, at the Bachelor
Profs.' house. In their host's study
they were favored with a most in
teresting talk upon the " Post-em
bryonic development of insects."
Professor Kellogg explained that
forms like the housefly, which show
great outward change at different
stages, undergo even more striking
internal changes. During pupa
tion all systems, except the nervous
system, are disintegrated completely
by the aid of active white blood
corpuscles which attack and eat the
tissues, while the adult organs de
velop from tiny plates of cells
which have lain dormant, con
nected to the outer skin from which
they were originally derived.
Work upon the problems pre
sented by insect development has
been greatly facilitated by the dis
covery by W. A. Snow and R. E.
Snodgrass of the larva of the Giant
Crane Ply, holurusia rubignosa.
Dissections of this larva were
shown, also microscopic sections of
smaller laraj illustrating various
points of minute anatomy.
