# ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION.
## President Kellogg in the Founders' Day Address Advocates Higher Learning. 
### 
The chapel was well tilled Inst
night to hear President Martin
Kellogg of the University of Cali
fornia deliver his lecture* on the
"Economics of Education."
The platform was beautified by
quantities of palms, bamboo, and
flowers.
Vice-President Branner presided,
and after a solo, "The City Beau
tiful," by Mrs. Ross, introduced the
speaker of the evening.
'' The basis of economy in all its
applications." said the lecturer, " is
financial. In educational econo
mics the questions are such as these:
Does education pay ? How much of
it will pay ? At every advanced
step school numbers decrease. A
good number come to the threshold
of the high school, hut only a small
minority cross it. The reasons for
this steady diminution of attend
ance are chiefly financial. Parents
can not afford to give their children
too many years in school.
"The high school brings in an
other view of education. Its studies
are not only higher hut arranged
in different courses, calling for a
choice between them. The students
have reached an age when they
make some forecast of their future
careers. The questions, l)oes it pay ?
How much study will pay ? are
usually still in the foreground.
But another question begins to de
mand attention: What will he best
for me as a man, as a citizen in the
years to come ?
"The further one goes in the
high school the more urgent does
this new question become. The
former notion of the money value
of an education is still cherished;
but more and more comes in sight
the new question of the personal
value «»f education in term of man
hood.
" When one goes on to a college
course this second question returns
with an always greater urgency.
Ho by the time one has taken a
thorough college course lie knows,
even if he does not fully appreciate,
the second and most important end
of an education."
President Kellogg then proceeded
to speak of various urgent ques
tions that spring out of the econ
omics of higher education — the
choice of a career, the means best
suited to the ends in view, whether
a inan can become educated best by
himself or in company with others
pursuing the same ends, the scope
of one's work, narrow or compara
tively broad. He answered these
hist questions by saying that there
should be no narrow spirit in study
but a seeking of congenial com
panions and a generous hospitality
to all valuable knowledge.
Finally he considered the ques
tion, Is there a danger of drawing
too many into these higher courses?
If we regard education only as a
means of money-getting, in em
ployments that mark a separate
and higher caste, then there may
be too many of the educated. As
has already been said, the money
value of education is immeasurably
less than the personal value in
terms of manhood and womanhood,!

The men and women of educated
ranks, who can find a place in law
or medicine or school teaching or
in any of the more coveted employ
ments must do what the majority
of men and women are doing.
There must be a democratic will
ingness to accept the humbler lot.
Service is the one worthy thing to
seek; and if it be not high service,
let it be lowly. That, however
lowly, may be cheerful, hearty, and
happy.
We may set at rest our fears lest
there be too many highly edu
cated men and women. College
courses may be multiplied without
detriment to any community. If
much larger numbers than at pres
ent come under the elevating in
fluence of the higher studies, the
community at large will lie so
much the better and the happier,
if only common sense rules the
conduct of the educated.
President Kellogg concluded:
"This is Founders' Day for a
great and rich University. Today
more than one Founder is directly
celebrated; indirectly, still a third.
With serious joy these University
students commemorate the two
who are dead; they rejoice in the
continued life of the third. She
who was an equal partner in the
plans for a great institution of
learning, still broods it with a
mother's love. You all admire her
tireless devotion to this great pur
pose of her life; you recognize her
wisdom in administration, her
readiness to meet every emergency,
her energy in keeping in motion so
great and complex a machinery.
"We turn back on the point last
in our minds, and ask, 'Will this
institution become too great? In
connection with other universities,
which in various centers are draw
ing to themselves increasing num
bers, will it bring too many to fill
these pleasant halls to overflow
ing?' Not if our reasoning has
been on sound lines. Suppose that
your thousand became ten thous
and, with a like multiplication
elsewhere: will the Founders be
shorn of their honor? Nay, rather
let the common people flock by
hundreds of thousands to the
higher institutions of learning.
Then the whole mass of the com
munity will lie lifted to a hap
pier level and all will rise up
and call such Founders blessed.
We see the beauty and nobleness
of lives devoted to such good works,
to such far-reaching beneficence.
One star differeth from another star
in glory. But of all benefactors of
their fellow-men, how few can com
pare with the Founder of a great
and wisely ordered institution of
learning."
After the lecture Mrs. Boss sang
Millard's "Ave Maria."

ing?' Not if our reasoning has
been on sound lines. Suppose that
your thousand became ten thous
and, with a like multiplication
elsewhere: will the Founders be
shorn of their honor? Nay, rather
let the common people flock by
hundreds of thousands to the
higher institutions of learning.
Then the whole mass of the com
munity will lie lifted to a hap
pier level and all will rise up
and call such Founders blessed.
We see the beauty and nobleness
of lives devoted to such good works,
to such far-reaching beneficence.
One star differeth from another star
in glory. But of all benefactors of
their fellow-men, how few can com
pare with the Founder of a great
and wisely ordered institution of
learning."
After the lecture Mrs. Boss sang
Millard's "Ave Maria."
