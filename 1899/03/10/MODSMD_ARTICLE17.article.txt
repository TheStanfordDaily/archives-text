### 
It is proposed to publish during
the coming summer a volume of
sermons and addresses delivered by
Professor Thobum, provided an
edition of three hundred copies is
subscribed for in advance.
For such a volume there are
available six sermons given in the
University chapel (on "Liberty,"
"The Way," "New Wine and Old
Bottles," "Our Religion," "Our
Father," and the "Thanksgiving
Address" of lSy?) and an equal
number of relatively complete frag
ments of lectures on: "The bpiri
tual Life," "The New Birth,"
"Work," "Religion as a bocial
Factor," and probably one other.
This available material will make
an octavo volume of perhaps two
hundred pages. The price will be
$1.25 per volume.
Subscriptions should be made at
once. Blanks for this purpose may
be found at the University Book
store and at the Registrar's otlice,
or subscriptions may be sent direct
to O. L. Elliott, Stanford Univer
sity, Cal.
