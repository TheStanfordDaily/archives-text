# STANFORD OUTING CLUB.
## Members Meet to Discuss the Mapping of the Region and to Plan Work for the Future. 
### 
A small but enthusiastic meeting
of the Outing Club was held on
Wednesday evening in room 50.
President Dudley was in the chair
and A. M. Strong, '99, was present
with the map which he has been
preparing for the use of the club.
The first part of the evening was
devoted to a discussion of the work
which has been done and that which
remains to be done in mapping the
vicinity. Mr. Strong explained in
some detail the work of the United
States Geological Survey in making
a series of maps which are intended
in time to cover the entire area of
the United States. The four which
have been published for this region
were exhibited. Each covers an
area of about sixteen miles square,
and the four together include San
Mateo county and the vicinities of
Palo Alto, San Jose, and Mt. Ham
ilton. 'lihese maps are drawn to a
scale of about one mile to the inch.
All roads and buildings are indi
cated, while by the contour lines
the general character of the country
and the elevation of any point may
be ascertained. These maps may
be obtained for the price of five cents
each from the United States Geolog
ical department. Arrangements
will be made to have a number of
these ordered and placed on sale at
the University.
Mr. Strong then exhibited a map
which he has just completed, drawn
to a scale of two miles to the inch,
and covering the country from
Ocean View on the north to Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz on the east
and south. A tracing is now being
made from which blue prints of this
map can be taken, these to be
mounted for pocket use and placed
on sale for the sum of 75 cents.
These in the hands of the members
of the club can lie added to from
time to time and new prints taken
from the revised tracing can be ob
tained.
Professor Dudley in conclusion
outlined the work which needs yet
to be done in clearing and mapping
trails, erecting sign posts, and as
certaining distances between points.
This work is to be pushed with
vigor from now until the summer
vacation.
