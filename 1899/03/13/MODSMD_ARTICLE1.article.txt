# THE 						CONCERT.
## A 						Crowded Chapel, an Excellent and Well Rendered Program and $165 Clear. 
### 
The Training-House Benefit Con
cert on last Friday night was in
every way a much greater success
than had been anticipated by any
body interested in it.
The program was run off smoothly
from beginning to end and every
number on it was thoroughly en
joyable. There were twelve num
bers altogether, beginning with
" Hail, Stanford, Hail," sung by
the combined Glee Clubs, and clos
ing with the " Good Night" of the
Varsity Glee Club.
The Glee Clubs were very good,
both when they sang separately,
each being encored twice, and when
together. One of the most pleasing
parts of the program was the play
ing of the combination of the two
Mandolin Clubs. The Banjo Cluli
was the only musical organization
that did not have a counterpart
from the women, but its playing
took the house, as the hearty encore
showed.
The three "star artists" were at
their best. Miss Zucker read "The
Money Musk,'" accompanied on the
piano by Miss llurllnirt, and for
an encore recited "T he Kitchen
Clock" in a way that captured
the entire audience. "Dick" Cul
ver was especially funny in a
learned dissertation on art and
things in general. Riley's rendi
tion of " Zizzy ze, Znm Zum " was
as catchy as the famous " Punch
Brothers." His delivery of some
of James Whitcomb Riley's Hoo
sier Sketches was very strong.
Financially the concert was a
surprise. Every seat in the chapel
was reserved and occupied at the
beginning of the concert, so that
after all expenses are paid the fund
will be increased by at least $11)5.
The concert was undoubtedly one
of the best ever given here and was
such an unqualified success that
not only many who were unable to
attend last Friday but many who
did are anxious that it be repeated
in the immediate future. Many
requests for a repetition have al
ready come into the '99 Finance
Committee. They would not be
averse if they were assured that the
chapel could be filled again, but
unless they could be certain before
hand that enough people would buy
tickets to net at least -$75 they
would hesitate, fearing that it might
prove more of a detriment to suc
ceeding benefits which they are
planning than a real gain.
It is not yet known either whether
the ladies and gentlemen who as
sisted at Friday's concert would be
able or willing to take part in a
second.
