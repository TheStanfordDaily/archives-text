A pleasant feature of the con
cert Friday evening was the sing
ing by the combined CI lee Clubs of
"Mail, Stanford, Hail!" This
seemed very appropriate and, we
think, would be equally so at all
student gatherings where singing is
indulged in. A few more such cus
toms are needed here to give a
greater continuity to Stanford life
and to assist in forming traditions.
We hope our University Hymn will
be used more in the future.
