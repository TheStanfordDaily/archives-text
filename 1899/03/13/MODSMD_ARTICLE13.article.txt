The Training-House Concert
was such an unqualified success
that it is to be hoped that it can be
repeated so that the many who did
not attend on Friday night may
have an opportunity to hear the
concert which those who did at
tend enjoyed so much. Undoubt
edly if all who wish the program
to be repeated will make their de
sire known, those who took part
will be willing to grant their re
quest and we may expect to see the
chapel filled again.
