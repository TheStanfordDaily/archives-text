â€”The faculty of the University
of Pennsylvania have decided upon
several innovations in the law
school. One is a course in civil
law as administered in the llispano-
Ainerican countries. One of the
professors is now making a special
study of the subject and will prob
ably be granted a two years' leave
of absence to visit these countries
for the purpose of personal investi
gations. Another innovation will
be the opening of post graduate
courses.
