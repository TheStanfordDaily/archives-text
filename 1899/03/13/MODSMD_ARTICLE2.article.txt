'l he comic lecture by Mr. Stevens,
the inimitable comedian of the Tiv
oli Opera House, to be held in the
chapel next Thursday afternoon,at
half-past one, will give a good
chance for play-lovers to learn of
the ins and outs of the comedy
stage. Mr. Stevens will lecture,
answer questions, and give selec
tions; he is a most entertaining
talker, and the attractiveness of his
recitations and singing is too well

known to need comment. Those
who heard Mr. Wardes Shaks
perean lecture will have a his
tron'.c treat of an entirely different,
more novel, and no less interesting
character.
The entertainment is for the bene
fit of the 11)00 Annual, and is the
first one which Manager Taylor
had booked for that purpose. That
the lecture will be a success can not
be questioned. The tickets will be
on sale at the postoffice Wednesday
afternoon and Thursday morning ;
the price of admission is twenty-five
cents. There will be some reserved
seats at fifty.
