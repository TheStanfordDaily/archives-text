# Professor Brown's Paintings.

Professor Brown's exhibition is a
delight to the lovers of pictures. It
is difficult to speak with modera
tion of work so sincere, so unas
suming, so big-spirited, yet so ten
der and delicate. These are pic
tures that you could live with and
like better and better to the end of
time. Their chief charm lies in
their very lovely harmony of color,
in their truly poetic spirit, and in
their large-minded simplicity. Two
or three of them are studies of our
own sunburnt hills and plains, two
of Chinatown at Monterey, two or
three more of New England woods
and pastures, and one of a Scotch
lake. Most of them, however, are
poetic reminiscences of Western
New York, of the beautiful lake
country near Cornell University.
One wood interior — a study of
spindling trees with sunshine sift
ing through them to lie in patches
on the leaf covered ground—is as
beautiful in harmony of tender,
warm tones as can well be ; another
—somebody's barn and hay-stacks
on the top of a high hill, with just
a touch of sunlight and a fine mass
of clouds —is an equally lovely
harmony of cool greens and blues ;
another —a moonlight with trees
and clouds reflected in a lake—has
the large, quiet masses and absence
of detail that make the night
beloved of the painter. It is pleas
ant to seea painter who is well past
his experimental stage handle with
so much breadth and freedom such
various themes in so varied a man
ner. There is nothing stereotyped
or inevitable about his range of
subject, nothing hackneyed about
his way of painting. Th'e pictures
are to be shown at Vickery's during
the next, two weeks. Z. W. F.
