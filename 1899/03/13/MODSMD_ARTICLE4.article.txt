Dr. Warner writes from Las
Cruces, New Mexico, a cheery let
ter in which he says, in the words
of one of his "cowboy" friends,
'' There is still a chance that I shall
beat the game." lie proposes to
try "the therapeutic effects of a dry
hake during the approaching
summer, and has therefore taken
lip his residence a few miles out of
Las Cruces. Anions other things
lie says,"The news of Professor
Thoburn's death was .Â«lo\v in reach
ing me. One of the very best
things that I got from my last, se
mester's residence in I'alo Alto was
fuller acqiiaintanee wit h him. He
made a wonderfully long, brave
tight, and every month of life he
conquered was an additional bles
sing to those with whom lie lived
and worked."
