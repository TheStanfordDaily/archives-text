# GOOD BATTING.
## The
						Varsity Beats Santa Clara 5-0 on Saturday Last in a Pitchers' Game. 
### 
The Varsity played well in San
Jose on Saturday afternoon and by
superior battery won the game from
Santa Clara, 5-0. Lanagan showed
more conclusively than ever that
he is one of the strongest pitchers
ever in college, lie struck out seven
men and allowed only two hits and
one base on halls. He always had
perfect control of the ball and
played steadily.
The men fielded well but the
game was won by work at the bat,
Strohn, Young, and Murphy each
making three-base hits and Strohn
also a two-base hit.
Santa Clara played good baseball,
lvelley, their pitcher, especially,
who struck out twelve men. In
the ninth inning Santa Clara was
prevented from scoring only by
Murphy's catching a difficult Hy
and making a triple play to Strohn
to Young.
