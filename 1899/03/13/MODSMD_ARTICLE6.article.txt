The Annual University Handi
cap Field-day on Saturday pro
duced some good races, despite the
usual cold wind which blew down
the stretch. In the distances the
handicaps were too heavy for such
a cold day, but several men showed
up strongly, notably Williams in
the mile, who ran a, well-judged
race from scratch, healing out
Smith, who ran wilh him, handily,
in the last straightawav. Ilinman,
'01, who won the mile from the
200-yard mark", ran exceptionally
well for a new man. In the half
mile Stadtmuller, '01, atui Adams,
'00, first a ml seeond, with 100 yards
and 7") ya ids handicap res pee ti vel v,
made plucky finishes. Stewart,. '01,
won both dashes by his strong fin
ishes. The 220-yard dash wa« the
prettiest race of the day, the four
runners being closely hunched at
the finish. Stewart beating Trail
by only a few inches. The 120-
yard hurdle race was also close,
being undecided until St rout, beat
out Culver in the last 20 yards'
spurt. For the quarter all the men

j were tired, all except Smith and
: Bowman having been in two hard
| races before. Smith was stronger
j than the others, who weakened
| when the wind struck them. Ber
-1 wick showed evidence of becoming
a fast walker. Boyd, '00, and
Murphy, '02, were the best in the
jumps and vault.
The field-day showed our weak
ness in the weights and hurdles.
More candidates are needed in these
events, especially in the latter. It
will not be impossible for some of
the men out to develop into good
weights' men, but there are not
enough candidates and there are
almost none for the hurdles.
