# THE 						PHILOSOPHY OF DESPAIR.
## President Jordan's Sunday Sermon on Pessimism and Optimism. 
### 
Dr. Jordan took his subject for
tlie Sunday morning sermon from
Fitzgerald's version of the Rubai
yat of Omar Khayyam. He said:
"This poem of Omar is our best
expression of the sadness and the
grandeur of insoluble problems.
It is the sweetness of philosophical
sorrow, the sweetest of all sadness
because it has no kinship with
misery or distress.
In the presence of the infinite
problems of life ibe voice of science
is dumb, for science is the co-ordi
nate and corrected expression of
human experience, and human ex
perience must stop with the limi
tations of human liie. Science can
speak of the causes and results of
pessimism. It'can touch the prac
tical side of the riddle of life by
asking certain questions, the an
swers to which lie within the range
of human experience. Some of
these are: Why is there a ''Phil
osophy of Despair"? Can despair
be wrought into healthful lite? In
what part of the universe are you,
and what are you doing? Personal
despair or discouragement may
arise from the failure of strength
or the failure of plans.
To the pessimistic philosopher
the progress of the race is also
mere illusion. There is no prog
ress, only adaptation. "The river
fits its bed," tlu* martyr bis grid
iron. In such fashion we may
ring the changes of despair. To
grasp at ultimate truth is to be
forever empty-banded. To search
for the ultimate end of action is
never to begin to act. Deeper and
more worthy of respect is the sad
ness of science. The effort to "see
things as they really are," to get
out of all make-believes, and to se
cure that "absolute veracity of
thought" without which sound ac
tion is impossible, does not always
lead to hopefulness.
The common man, after all the
ages, is still common. He is ignor
ant, reachless, unjust, selfish, easily
misled. All public affairs bear the
stamp of his weakness. Especially
is this shown in the prevalence of
war. The boasted progress of civil
ization is dissolved in the barbar
ism of war. Whether glory of con
quest or commercial greed be war's
purpose, the result of war is death:
its essential features is I lie slaughter
of the young, the brave, and the
ambitious, leaving the weak, the
sickly, the discouraged to per
petuate the race. Thus all military
nations become decadent ones.
That there seems no way out of
this is the cause of the boundless
despair of the thinking men of con
tinental Europe. The forces of
darkness are still strong, anil it
seems sometimes as if the middle
ages would swallow up everything
won by modern struggles. It is
pathetic to see how men fear to face
the future. No one has the heart
t> probe the next decade.
The pessimist tells us that " the
only reality in life is pain." Bui
surely this is not the real truth.
He who knows no reality save ap
petite, has never known life at all.
The realities in life are love and
action, not the desire but. the exer

cise of our appointed functions. To
act and to love are the true func
tions of the human body and soul.
The third question which science
may ask is the direct one, In what
part of the universe are you and
what are you doing? Thoreau
says that " there is no hope for you
unless this bit of sod under your
feet is the sweetest to you in this
world —in any world." Why not ?
Nowhere is the sky so blue, the
grass so green, the sunshine so
bright, the whole so welcome as
right here. No other blue sky, nor
bright sunshine, nor welcome shade
exists for you. Other skies are
bright to other men. What our
part may signify in the great whole
we may not understand, but we are
here to play it, and now is the
time.
What then are you doing under
these blue skies? The thing you
do should be for you the most im
portant thing in the world. if
each one did the best he knew he
would be on the highway to greater
knowledge and still therefore better
action.
Optimism in life is a good work
ing hypothesis, if blindness and
self-satisfaetion be not its main
spring. "'Wisdom is knowing what
to do next; virtue is doing it." Re
ligion is (lie heart impulse that
turns us towards the best and
brightest course of action.
What matter is it that time does
not end with us; neither with us
does history begin.
" The Eternal Saki from that
bowl bath poured millions of bub
bles like lis, and shall pour."
Why not? Should life stop with
you? What have you done that
you should mark the end of time?
If you have played your part in
the procession of bubbles, all is
well, though the best you can do is
to leave the world a little better for
the next that follows.
If you have not made life a little
richer and its conditions a little
more just, by your living, you have
not touched the world. You are
indeed a bubble. If some kind
friend somewhere turn down an
empty glass it will be the best
monument you deserve.
"A single note in the Eternal Song
The perfect Singer yet hath need
for me."
"1 do rejoice that when of Thee and
Me
Men speak no longer, yet not less
but more
The Eternal Saki still that bowl
shall fill,
And even fairer, stronger bubbles
pour."
Tennyson has said:
"1 falter where I firmly trod,
And falling with my weight of
cares,
Upon the World's great Altar
Stairs
That slope through darkness, up
to God."
The great altar stairs of which
no man knows the beginning nor
the end, do not spring from the
mire nor end in the mists. They
"slope through darkness up to
God," and no one could ask a
stronger expression than this of
thai robust cheerfulness which
must be the mainspring of life.

cure that "absolute veracity of
thought" without which sound ac
tion is impossible, does not always
lead to hopefulness.
The common man, after all the
ages, is still common. He is ignor
ant, reachless, unjust, selfish, easily
misled. All public affairs bear the
stamp of his weakness. Especially
is this shown in the prevalence of
war. The boasted progress of civil
ization is dissolved in the barbar
ism of war. Whether glory of con
quest or commercial greed be war's
purpose, the result of war is death:
its essential features is I lie slaughter
of the young, the brave, and the
ambitious, leaving the weak, the
sickly, the discouraged to per
petuate the race. Thus all military
nations become decadent ones.
That there seems no way out of
this is the cause of the boundless
despair of the thinking men of con
tinental Europe. The forces of
darkness are still strong, anil it
seems sometimes as if the middle
ages would swallow up everything
won by modern struggles. It is
pathetic to see how men fear to face
the future. No one has the heart
t> probe the next decade.
The pessimist tells us that " the
only reality in life is pain." Bui
surely this is not the real truth.
He who knows no reality save ap
petite, has never known life at all.
The realities in life are love and
action, not the desire but. the exer

cise of our appointed functions. To
act and to love are the true func
tions of the human body and soul.
The third question which science
may ask is the direct one, In what
part of the universe are you and
what are you doing? Thoreau
says that " there is no hope for you
unless this bit of sod under your
feet is the sweetest to you in this
world —in any world." Why not ?
Nowhere is the sky so blue, the
grass so green, the sunshine so
bright, the whole so welcome as
right here. No other blue sky, nor
bright sunshine, nor welcome shade
exists for you. Other skies are
bright to other men. What our
part may signify in the great whole
we may not understand, but we are
here to play it, and now is the
time.
What then are you doing under
these blue skies? The thing you
do should be for you the most im
portant thing in the world. if
each one did the best he knew he
would be on the highway to greater
knowledge and still therefore better
action.
Optimism in life is a good work
ing hypothesis, if blindness and
self-satisfaetion be not its main
spring. "'Wisdom is knowing what
to do next; virtue is doing it." Re
ligion is (lie heart impulse that
turns us towards the best and
brightest course of action.
What matter is it that time does
not end with us; neither with us
does history begin.
" The Eternal Saki from that
bowl bath poured millions of bub
bles like lis, and shall pour."
Why not? Should life stop with
you? What have you done that
you should mark the end of time?
If you have played your part in
the procession of bubbles, all is
well, though the best you can do is
to leave the world a little better for
the next that follows.
If you have not made life a little
richer and its conditions a little
more just, by your living, you have
not touched the world. You are
indeed a bubble. If some kind
friend somewhere turn down an
empty glass it will be the best
monument you deserve.
"A single note in the Eternal Song
The perfect Singer yet hath need
for me."
"1 do rejoice that when of Thee and
Me
Men speak no longer, yet not less
but more
The Eternal Saki still that bowl
shall fill,
And even fairer, stronger bubbles
pour."
Tennyson has said:
"1 falter where I firmly trod,
And falling with my weight of
cares,
Upon the World's great Altar
Stairs
That slope through darkness, up
to God."
The great altar stairs of which
no man knows the beginning nor
the end, do not spring from the
mire nor end in the mists. They
"slope through darkness up to
God," and no one could ask a
stronger expression than this of
thai robust cheerfulness which
must be the mainspring of life.
