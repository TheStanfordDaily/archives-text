# Next Thursday's Entertainment.

### 
To theatre-goers on the Coast Mr.
Edwin Stevens needs no introduc
tion. Every one who keeps pace
with things theatrical has laughed
and admired his inimitable comic
opera and, what is better, is always
eager to hear it repeated. A prac
tical proof of this is the fact that
Mr. Stevens has tilled the leading
role in the Tivoli uninterruptedly
for two years and has never failed
to draw large houses.
Mr. Stevens is, besides an actor,
a lecturer of considerable ability.
Aside from a wide, practical, intel
ligent knowledge of his subject, he
has the actor's ability to make you
enjoy what he is saying and a
comedian's knack of making you
laugh whether you will or not.
His lectures are given in a man
ner all his own, full of surprises
and eccentricities, always amusing
and comical. 1 he entertainment
will almost amount to a little comic
opera, for it will be profusely ill us
trated by musical and dramatic
selections. Notable among these is
" The Road to Mandalay,''for the
rendition of which Mi 1 . Stevens has
made himself famous.
The entertainment has been well
advertised and Manager Taylor
reports that all prospects indicate a
large house. Tickets will be on
sale at the University postoffice
tomorrow afternoon and Thursday
morning. The entertainment itself
takes place in the chapel Thursday
at 1:30.
