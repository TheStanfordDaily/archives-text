# PROF. NEWCOMER'S RHETORIC.
## Favorable Criticism for "Elements of Rhetoric" in the "Dial." 
### 
A recent number of the l>'ml
gives a very favorable notice of
Professor Newcomer's " Elements
of Rhetoric," just published by
Henry Holt Co., New York.
" Mr. Newcomer," it says, " is one
of those professors of rhetoric who
believe that a writer should con
sider first what be would say, and
only when that is settled should he
consider what particular words to
use. This obvious view is not com
mon among our writers on rhetoric,
although Mr. Newcomer's is by no
means the only book in recent years
which has been based upon it. The
older writers—Professor Bain, for
instance, or Professor A. S. Hill —
prefer to begin with a study of
words. The latter especially did
great things in the cause of diction.
Their influence has been such that
most people (even in college facul
ties) think that there is no rhet
orical fault worse than misspelling
or bad grammar ; such at least are
the only faults ever mentioned.
The newer practice is really not
new ; it has the authority of every
rhetoriCan who ever put pen to
paper, from the days of Korax and
Tisias down to the time that Dr.
George Campbell, with his specula
tions on Good Usage, knocked the
classical rhetoric into a cocked
hat, so far as authority was con
cerned. We do not mean that Mr.
Newcomer is a neo-Aristotelian, or
any other such creature ; his earlier
book, which bad something to do
in bringing about the change of
heart that is gradually taking place,
was a very simple talk to school
boys and school-girls as to what
they could write about best. It
said nothing iibout Aristotle; but
then, it had nothing of Campbell
either. The present work, founded
on the right theory, and the result
of individual work of some years
on the right lines, has a great deal
in it that is direct and practical.
We are glad to see it, and hope we
may help it a bit toward a wide
circulation."
Professor Newcomer's book has
already been adopted as a text-book
by the University of Chicago.
