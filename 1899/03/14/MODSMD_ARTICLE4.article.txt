# Steel Specimens.

A valuable and interesting gift
has recently been presented to the
Mechanical Kugineering depart
ment through the courtesy of \V.
M. Parkin, '01, and his father, Mr.
Charles Parkin, of the Crescent
••Steel Company, Pittsburg, Pa. It

consists of a col lection of steels
manufactured by this company
and comprises about seventy-five
specimens, ranging in size from tine
wire up to heavy tool steel bar.
Round, square, octagonal, oblong,
and many special forms of cross,
section are represented in various
sizes and grades. A series of ingot
toppings illustrates very beautifully
the characteristic fractures corres
ponding to proportions of carbon
varying from 0 2 per cent, to 2.4
per cent. There are also speci
mens of tungsten steel, of ferro
manganese, ferro-silicon, ferro
chrome, spiegeleisen, and black
oxide of manganese.
A piece of black-lead crucible
shows the nature of the highly re
fractory material in which the cast
steel is melted.
Lastly, there are two extremely
interesting series of specimens
whose fractures illustrate proper
and improper heat treatment of
high-grade steel.
A suitable cabinet has been
built and the specimens arranged
in it so that they can be examined
to good advantage. The collection
will be of especial value in connec
tion with that part of the work in
Constructive Materials which deals
with the metallurcy of steel, as it
adds very considerably to the de
partment's collection of illustrative
specimens.
