The Stanford Outing Club oc
cupies a unique position among
college organizations. Few univer
sities on this side the Atlantic are
so situated as to tempt the student
to exploration for other than scien
tific purposes. Hut our own loca
tion, at the very foot of a range of
mountains from one to three
thousand feet in height, superbly
wooded and commanding a sweep
ing view of valley, bay, and ocean,
tempts many out to enjoy the ex
hilaration of a mountain climb.
The Outing Club is small in num
bers but active in its efforts to put
data into the hands of the Univer
sity at large which will help stud
ents to make their way safely and
by the most advantageous routes
to new points.
Whether many or few avail

themselves of the opportunities
placed within their reach, those
who do add their names to the
growing list of the Outing Club
and join their interest in explora
; tion to that already existent, will
he decided gainers, and we venture
to predict that their memories of
Stanford in the days to come will
be infinitely richer than the recol
lections of those who spend their
days in an unvaried and joyless
grind.
