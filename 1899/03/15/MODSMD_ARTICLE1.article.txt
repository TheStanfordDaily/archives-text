# THE 						OTHER SIDE.
## Hon. Horace G. Piatt Says Expansion Will Be But a Broader Democracy. 
### 
The expansionists of the Uni
versity had last night their first
opportunity of the year to nod ap
proval upon an argument in sym
pathy with their belief. The Hon
orable Horace («. Piatt gave con
cerning the so-called "Imperialism"
a study, considering first, the origin
of the question ; second, the con
stitutionality of expansion, and
third, the problems that arise in it.
There was in the beginning a pic
turesque arraying of the story of
Spain. When he came to his real
argument, Hon. Mr. Piatt showed
a thorough knowledge of the more
telling force of plain evidence.
To pass at once to the substance
of the argument : Why was the
Spanish war entered upon ? There
is the one reply, "For the cause of
humanity alone." It, was not con
quest, not expansion, not the hope
of empire in the Orient. We have
gained the independence of Cuba.
Our forces remain there : our pur
pose is to assist the Cubans in at
taining a smooth self government.
When this is gained our military
protection will be withdrawn, lint
on this withdrawal, it is certain
that the free Republic of Cuba will
ask and obtain admission into the
Federal Union. The ultimate addi
tion of Cuba is not the upstart
policy of our present politicians.
It was advised by Jefferson, and
supported through ihe long line of
leaders of the early republic. Jeffer
son was one among the most active
in the adoption of the Constitution.
Yet the anti-expansionist theories,
held t<> be the law of the early
statesman, was by Jefferson him
self set aside when he negotiated
the acquisition of Louisiana. Jeffer
son justified himself by the change
in conditions. He was wise enough
to know that constitutions and poli
cies are for countries, and not coun
tries for constitutions and policies
Nor can the spread of our power
be held an abandonment of the
Monroe Doctrine. We still shall
bar Europe from conquest that
shall endanger our republic.
Just as Jefferson widened the in
terpretation of the Constitution, so
today is it widened as a result of
the Spanish war. Just as condi
tions arose that made the acquisi
tion of Louisiana a wise course, so
today conditions have arisen that
modify the close of the Spanish
war. We have the Philippines. It
is no longer a question, and the
thing to do is to accept the prob
lem as it stands, and not-to argue
it from a ground that does not ex
ist. Our hand is at the plow, and
we must follow the furrow to the
end. The Philippines are of our
territory, and there is no other dis
posal possible now. If this is "Im
perialism," then it. began with Jef
ferson. It is said that our govern
ment will be demoralized b}' exten
sion. If this is true, then we are
unfortunate: we are there. The
wisdom of today is not in seeking
to pull away, but in considering
how to bear a responsibility already
upon us. We went in for Cuba,
but we must get out for ourselves.
Texas is a precedent.

There is one great argument of
the anti-expansionists—"You have;
not the consent of the governed;
therefore, you violate the primary!
principle of our republic." It is
already specially provided that
Congress shall have full power to
establish all rules and regulations
fur the government of territory he
longing to the Union. The word
belonging is to he marked —not of
the Union, hut belonging, as did all
the added territory, and as does
Arizona, Alaska, and Hawaii to
day, and we violate 110 more
the principle of our government
than we did in each other addition
we have made to our territory.
There is scarcely an argument used
today against the holding of the
Philippines that was not in its time
urged against each other of our
acquisitions. Concerning each other
acquisition, time has proved the
emptiness of those arguments.
It is said that extension of our
government will extend our rotten
methods. In answer, study Eng
land. One hundred years ago,
Wa 1 pole's England was a govern
ment more corrupt than any
America ever knew. With colonial
expansion came political purity.
The public studied foreign admin
istration, and demanded honesty.
Therefore, the central government
became honest. It will be so with
rtineiiea. government >\<ll be
what the people demand. Added
responsibility will rouse the people,
as they will not rouse under the
ease of the present; and roused,
they will have what they decide.
It is declared that we shall be
obliged to have resource to military
ruleof the newly-acquired territory.
That is true. There is nothing
startling in that to America. It
was so that we have held each fresh
addition before. Our standing
army has been increased to 100,000
for two years. It will be needed
for more than two years, till a full
confidence is established, and the
people learn security. More money
for the army and less for pensions
will not burden the tax-payer.
It. is warned that a larger stand
ing army will introduce into Amer
ica.the evils of militarism, so glar
ing in the establishment in Europe.
The answer is the in contrast be
tween the American recruit and the
foreigner. The American recruit is
trained in our public schools and
the universities and in his civil life
to be democratic. An army des
potism can not be established from
democratic members.
The United States has taken its
place in the commercial competi
tion of nations. It must have safe
guards for its commerce. We must
take a position where we can de
mand and exact a share, or we
shall not get it. We have the cour
age for that, and the Philippines
are a part of our facilities. The
world will belong t<> ihe Slav, the
people young and limitless, and to
the Anglo-Saxon, imw in its prime
of vigor. We must start into the
wider world, and we must start
with no uncertainty. We shall be
equal. There will be no perversion
of principle, (irovernnif nt will con
tinue to be of, by, and for the peo
ple. Expansion will but be a
broader democracy.

Spanish war entered upon ? There
is the one reply, "For the cause of
humanity alone." It, was not con
quest, not expansion, not the hope
of empire in the Orient. We have
gained the independence of Cuba.
Our forces remain there : our pur
pose is to assist the Cubans in at
taining a smooth self government.
When this is gained our military
protection will be withdrawn, lint
on this withdrawal, it is certain
that the free Republic of Cuba will
ask and obtain admission into the
Federal Union. The ultimate addi
tion of Cuba is not the upstart
policy of our present politicians.
It was advised by Jefferson, and
supported through ihe long line of
leaders of the early republic. Jeffer
son was one among the most active
in the adoption of the Constitution.
Yet the anti-expansionist theories,
held t<> be the law of the early
statesman, was by Jefferson him
self set aside when he negotiated
the acquisition of Louisiana. Jeffer
son justified himself by the change
in conditions. He was wise enough
to know that constitutions and poli
cies are for countries, and not coun
tries for constitutions and policies
Nor can the spread of our power
be held an abandonment of the
Monroe Doctrine. We still shall
bar Europe from conquest that
shall endanger our republic.
Just as Jefferson widened the in
terpretation of the Constitution, so
today is it widened as a result of
the Spanish war. Just as condi
tions arose that made the acquisi
tion of Louisiana a wise course, so
today conditions have arisen that
modify the close of the Spanish
war. We have the Philippines. It
is no longer a question, and the
thing to do is to accept the prob
lem as it stands, and not-to argue
it from a ground that does not ex
ist. Our hand is at the plow, and
we must follow the furrow to the
end. The Philippines are of our
territory, and there is no other dis
posal possible now. If this is "Im
perialism," then it. began with Jef
ferson. It is said that our govern
ment will be demoralized b}' exten
sion. If this is true, then we are
unfortunate: we are there. The
wisdom of today is not in seeking
to pull away, but in considering
how to bear a responsibility already
upon us. We went in for Cuba,
but we must get out for ourselves.
Texas is a precedent.

There is one great argument of
the anti-expansionists—"You have;
not the consent of the governed;
therefore, you violate the primary!
principle of our republic." It is
already specially provided that
Congress shall have full power to
establish all rules and regulations
fur the government of territory he
longing to the Union. The word
belonging is to he marked —not of
the Union, hut belonging, as did all
the added territory, and as does
Arizona, Alaska, and Hawaii to
day, and we violate 110 more
the principle of our government
than we did in each other addition
we have made to our territory.
There is scarcely an argument used
today against the holding of the
Philippines that was not in its time
urged against each other of our
acquisitions. Concerning each other
acquisition, time has proved the
emptiness of those arguments.
It is said that extension of our
government will extend our rotten
methods. In answer, study Eng
land. One hundred years ago,
Wa 1 pole's England was a govern
ment more corrupt than any
America ever knew. With colonial
expansion came political purity.
The public studied foreign admin
istration, and demanded honesty.
Therefore, the central government
became honest. It will be so with
rtineiiea. government >\<ll be
what the people demand. Added
responsibility will rouse the people,
as they will not rouse under the
ease of the present; and roused,
they will have what they decide.
It is declared that we shall be
obliged to have resource to military
ruleof the newly-acquired territory.
That is true. There is nothing
startling in that to America. It
was so that we have held each fresh
addition before. Our standing
army has been increased to 100,000
for two years. It will be needed
for more than two years, till a full
confidence is established, and the
people learn security. More money
for the army and less for pensions
will not burden the tax-payer.
It. is warned that a larger stand
ing army will introduce into Amer
ica.the evils of militarism, so glar
ing in the establishment in Europe.
The answer is the in contrast be
tween the American recruit and the
foreigner. The American recruit is
trained in our public schools and
the universities and in his civil life
to be democratic. An army des
potism can not be established from
democratic members.
The United States has taken its
place in the commercial competi
tion of nations. It must have safe
guards for its commerce. We must
take a position where we can de
mand and exact a share, or we
shall not get it. We have the cour
age for that, and the Philippines
are a part of our facilities. The
world will belong t<> ihe Slav, the
people young and limitless, and to
the Anglo-Saxon, imw in its prime
of vigor. We must start into the
wider world, and we must start
with no uncertainty. We shall be
equal. There will be no perversion
of principle, (irovernnif nt will con
tinue to be of, by, and for the peo
ple. Expansion will but be a
broader democracy.
