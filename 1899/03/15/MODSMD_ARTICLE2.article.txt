# EDWIN STEVENS.
## Something- About the Versatile Actor Who Will Furnish Entertainment Tomorrow. 
### 
A few months ago Mr. Edwin
Stevens surprised the public of San
Francisco by producing a serious,
thoughtful, and masterly Cyrano de
Bergerac. People who for years
had laughed at Stevens' inimitable
comic opera did not look to find in
this comedian the deeper apprecia
tion necessary for the rendition of
llostand's romantic comedy ; yet
the production, in spite of the
handicap it suffered throng indif
ferent support, was, as concerns the
principal, a brilliant success.
There is probably no actor today
on the American stage more ver
satile than Mr. Stevens. We might
infer as much from merely reading
the titles of some of the plays in
which he has scored a decided hit:
The Geisha,, ]Vang, The Mikado,
Ship Ahoy, Sinbad the Sailor, The
Mascot, Suzette, The Yellow Dwarf,
Mother Goose, The Wedding Pay,
and The Circus (^neen.
In the last named opera he sang
"On the Road to Mandalay" and
gained a widespread reputation for
the added meaning which he gave
to Kipling's beautiful stanzas. As
Colonel Mapleson Mluberry in Ship
Ahoy, and Monsieur Pericole in The
Wedding Day, he has done some of
his best light comedy work.
Professor I)uPont Svle, in one 01
his criticisms on light opera, says
that no comedian can take an old
man's part more effectively or con
sistently than can Edwin Stevens.
In speaking of the necessity of a
close observance of harmony and a
clear enunciation, lie points to Mr.
Stevens as an example of correct,
coherent phrasing in parts particu
larly fast in time and difficult in
movement, making, as he does,
every word perfectly distinct
Mr. Stevens, upon request, has
agreed to sing some of bis more
, successful songs and recite the ever
new "Casey at the Hat," which,
thanks to the actor's splendid con
trol of dialects, contains a half
dozen comic personalities.
The talk tomorrow afternoon will
not be a lecture after the conven
tional formula. Mr. Stevens' lec
tures are unconventional in the ex
treme. While he instructs he
amuses, and while he amuses he in
structs ; and if by chance his hear
ers go away without a burden of
knowledge, they are not able to say
that they have not been amused.
Mr. Ste\e is will tell of his early
experiences on the stage; lie will
sing and tell stories and even exe
cute a few sleight of hand tricks,
just to show us what an actor may
pick up in the course of his experi
ence. In short, there will be many
surprises and a great deal of fun
throughout an entertainment which
will be of much artistic value and
of the greatest interest through its
novelty.
Seats Were on sale in the post
office this afternoon and are going
well. Manager Taylor will also
have them for sale tomorrow until
12:80.
