# Field-Day Dates Changed.
## 
### 
On account of the rain the trip
of the sophomores to Ukiah will
probably have to be postponed. If
this is done, it was decided that it
would be better to omit the pro
posed interclass field-day on .Jun
ior Day, especially as the Lowell
high school boys want to meet the
freshmen on Saturday, the twenty
fifth. It is likely that on that date
the freshmen will contest with
Lowell high on the campus and
the sophomores will go to Ukiah.
If the weather permits, the games
scheduled for next Saturday be
tween Oakland High and '02 will
take place next Saturday.
