Prof. K. A. C. Perrine, head of
the department of Electrical En
gineering, who is away on a two
years' leave of absence, lias just
witnessed the completion, by the
Standard Electrical Company, of
which lie is engineer, of the first
forty-five mile â– division of what will
be one of the longest lines for elec
trical transmission in the world.
The line has now reached Stockton.
When finished to San Francisco, a
distance of 110 miles frbm the
source of power, it will enable the
Standard Company to compote suc
cessfully with companies now gen
erating their electricity by use of
coal. So long a line presents great
difficulties in the Wjjty of loss of
power, but most of these have been
eliminated by careful engineering.
An interesting fact is that the line
wires are of aluminum. The elec
tric pressure will be about 40,000
volts.
