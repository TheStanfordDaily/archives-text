In past years when debating ac
tivity was almost exclusively con
fined to the six debating societies,
an annual League meet was a good
thing, inducing a feeling of solidar
ity among otherwise discrete bod
ies. Now, however, the suggestion
of the League executive committee
that this contest be omitted this
year, is worthy of consideration for
two reasons. This year, almost
for the first time, the societies find
themselves the sharers in a wider
interest in debating than the col
lege has ever known before. No
need then, to get together to fan a
tiny spark; the spark has long
since burst into a promising blaze.
Again, our debating schedule is so
full that unimportant debating
events may well be ruled off.
Constant interruption of their
weekly programs induces irregular
ity on the part of the members,
and breaks into the regular work,
to the detriment of all concerned.
The matter ought to be well dis
cussed, however, before action is
taken. To that end, let all mem
bers of the League be on hand
promptly at the meeting on Satur
day.
