# Stevens' Lecture.
## 
### 
A good-sized audience listened to
Mr. Edwin Stevens, who came down
from the city this afternoon to give
a lecture for the benefit of the
Junior Annual. Mr. Stevens has
none of the ear-marks of the usual
professional actor, spoke as a cul
tured gentleman, with a keen and
subtle sense of the ridiculous, and
the power to make others perceive
the same ludicrous side of things.
Reside his lecture, Mr. Stevens
gave an excellent exhibition of ven
triloquism, and some sleight of hand
per formances.
One of the most pleasing parts of
the program was Mr. Stevens' sing
ing, Kipling's "Road to Mandalay"
and "Danny Deever" being espe
cially encored.
The Quad realized something like
$50 by the lecture.
