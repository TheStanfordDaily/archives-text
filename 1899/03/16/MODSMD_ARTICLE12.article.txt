One phase of Stanford life which
is seriously neglected by a large
number of students, is the unusu
ally favorable opportunities which
are offered here for one to become
well acquainted with one's profes
sors in a social way. Every stu
dent who has his own fullest de
velopment at heart will make it a
point to attend as many of the 'Sit
homes" of his favorite professors as
he can. The largest and most valu
able part of the education of almost
every one here will be found at the
close of his college career to have
been drawn from personal contact
with men, and from personal in
spiration, rather than from the
mere reading of books.
