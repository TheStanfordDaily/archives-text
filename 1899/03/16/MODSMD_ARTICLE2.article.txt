						Junior Farce.

### 
The Junior Farce, "Golf and
Politics," has been placed in the
hands of a well-selected cast, and is
being rehearsed every day. A
favored few who witnessed the re
hearsal last evening say that the
piece is unusually bright and clever,
and full of amusing situations.
Tin players, who comprise our best
known talent, are entering into
their work with much spirit and
enthusiasm, and in spite of the
shortness of time in which to pre
pare, will give a very creditable
performance.
