G. E. Leavitt, ex-'9&, writing
from Mil nil a to the Intercollegiau,
the organ of the student depart
ment of the V. i\l. C. A. and of the
â–ºStudent Volunteer Movement for
Foreign Missions, says:
"Needs always imply danger.
The greatest danger to which the
Filipinos are subjected is an in
coming Hood of civilization. Now
that Spain's sovereignty is a thing
of the past, and the United States
will shortly take her place, modern
civilization will turn this way.
Could it he administered in digest
ible quantities, well and good; hut
it will come in great quantities,
and will have to be bolted, and the
Philippine Islands will have to
suffer. To prevent the indiscrimi
nate assimilation of good and bad,
Christianity must keep pace with
this civilization.
"The first wave of immigration
will be composed mostly of adven
turous spirits who have come as
miners or for business only, and
who will not consider the welfare of
the natives. Money will be their
god, and no other will be held up
before a very uncultivated race. We
must counteract this baneful influ
ence in its infancy, if our new East
Indian possessions are to be
Christ's.
"There is another thing that will
work great disaster among the na
tives, and that is the influence of
our soldiers. 1 am a soldier, and
think that there are no soldiers like
our own ; but it grieves me to say
that in many ways their actions do
not recommend the Christian nation
they represent. The natives have
an exalted idea of us. To them we
appear to be rich, good natured,
and not careful of our morals. As

soldiers they admire arid respect
us, and are quickly adopting our
method of fighting. But are they
copying our morals ? I must say,
yes. As soldiers, only our rougher
characteristics are seen by the na
tives, consequently our influence
will not he for the best. Eventually
we will occupy the interior towns,
and extend our influence still
farther."
lie advocates voluntary mission
ary work to counteract these bad
influences, and the influence of the
superstition introduced by the
Spanish priests.
