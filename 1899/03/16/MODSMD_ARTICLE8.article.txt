# New Specimens.
## 
### 
Yesterday there was received at
the Zoology laboratory one of the
finest collections of fishes obtained
this year. These were collected by
a brother of Dr. Wood, in Hono
lulu, and are the result of six
months' constant watching of
Hawaiian markets. They repre
sent most of the strange specimens
of the Middle Pacific, together with
many that are entirely new. They
will be classified and catalogued
immediately.
