# UNIVERSITY Y. M. C. A.
## A 						Report Showing the Work and Condition of the Association 
### 
There are at present registered
in the University b(33 men. As
shown by the cards tilled out at
matriculation, 211 are members of
churches; this includes thirty
three per cent, of the men of the
Senior class, thirty-live per cent, of
the Juniors, thirty-four and four
tenths per cent, of the Sophomores,
and twenty-live per cent, of the
Freshmen. To give these men the
opportunity for religious affiliation,
to arrange and conduct meetings
for worship, to assist new and old
students in becoming acquainted,
and, incidentally, to give socials
and outings, to help needy stu
dents, and to instil a high moral
standard into our University life,
the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion exists. This is established un
der the supervision of the college
department of the International
Y. M. C. A., of which in this country
there are branches at 480 institu
tions, with a membership of 47,000.
The young women have a some
what similar organization, which
co-operates with that of the young
men in the Sunday evening meet
ings and in social affairs.
This is the first year that a Gen
eral Secretary has been at the
University. Mr. J.C. Brail was en
gaged last summer upon the recom
mendation of C. C. Michener, Trav
eling International Secretary for
the Collegiate branch of the west
ern portion of the United States.
The secretary's duties are those of
general supervisor or " coach " ; he
is to direct and suggest, to get ac
quainted with the men and encour
age them to work. During the
past year, although the member
ship has increased little, the work
in its different branches has become
thoroughly organized, and such an
interest has of late been aroused in
the members that the outlook is
promising for vigorous and effective
efforts next year.
At present the University or
ganization has seventeen active and
five associate members, only church
members being enrolled as active.
All men, however, who desire to
identify themselves with the Asso
ciation, may become associates This
enables them to help in any part of
the work and receive all benefits,
but does not place them under ob
ligations to assist at the religious
meetings. The dues are $1.00 a
year.
At 4:30 YVednesday afternoons
in room 23, the Association holds a
half-hour song and praise service,
to which all men are invited. The
average attendance at these meet
ings this semester has been seven
teen. Sunday evening in thechapel
at 7 o'clock the Y. M. C. A. and
Y. YV. C. A. hold a joint meeting
at which the average attendance
has been forty-eight.
The Association is at present con
ducting a course in the study of the
life of Christ, following Sharman's
studies based on Stevens and Bur
ton's "Harmony of the Gospels."
This involves about twenty min
utes' reading each day, and the
classes meet on Sunday morning 4 ,0
review the work of the week. Of

the sixteen men who began the;
course last September, thirteen are,
still pursuing it. Any one desiring |
to familiarize himself with the life'
of Christ may take up the study.
One feature of the work is to,
bring to the University well-known ;
men. Last March Robert Gailey, |
a Princeton graduate, then on his
way to the Asiatic field, spoke here
on the student volunteer move
ment; C. C. Michener, traveling col
legiate secretary, was here last
spring, and is to come again next'
May; H. YV. Rose, general secretary
at the University of Michigan, is
expected in about two months.
California State Secretary, YV. M.
Parsons, was at the University yes
terday and today lending the of
ficers assistance and direction in
their efforts to devise means for
adjusting the finances. Just now
the Association is making strenu
ous efforts to get Dwight L. Moody,
the evangelist, to speak here some
time next week.
The joint associations publish
annually a statistical hand-book of
the University and Palo Alto, giv
ing all facts with regard to board
ing places, etc.
The Y. YV. C. A. summer school
held at Pacific Grove in May, one of
the four in the United States, was
attended last year by eight Stanford
men. Its purpose is to train men
in the Association work, and this
year there will probably be several
representatives from the University
at the session from May 19 to May
28. Mr. Brail acted as secretary of
the State Convention in San Jose a
few weeks ago, J. C. Staley was
a member of the Rusiness Commit
tee, and Professor Miller is on the
State Executive Committee.
