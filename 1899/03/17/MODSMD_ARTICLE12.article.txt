The courtesy extended by the
Collegiate Alumnae to the women
of the Class of '99 is one of which
appreciation can be expressed in
but one way, and that is to attend.
A similar opportunity to become
acquainted with present and future
members of the alumnae of ninny
colleges was offered last year, when
the Collegiate Alumnae gave a lun
cheon to the women of '98 in the
parlors of the Century Club. At
that time Berkeley was better rep
resented than Stanford. Should
that happen this year it will be the
loss of Stanford as well as that ol
the individuals who fail to respond.
