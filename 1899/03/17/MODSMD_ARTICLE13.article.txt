It will probably do no good to
score in these columns whoever it
was that trailed heavy feet across
the muddy baseball infield yester
day. He does not care enough for
student body interests to read the
Daily Palo Alto. It is unfortu
nate, though, that he was not seen
by somebody who does care, and
who would have made him under
stand in what regard such as he are
held. The inevitable expenses of
our athletics are large enough with
out a needless increase through
heedlessness, and the available
money is so limited that what is
put out for repairs on the field
must lessen the total sum and
cramp needed outlays.
