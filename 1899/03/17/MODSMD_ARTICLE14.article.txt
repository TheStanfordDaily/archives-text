The report of the work and pur
poses of the Young Men's Christian
Association calls attention to the
value of this organization in our
University. Organized primarily
for a religious purpose, which it
promotes through its weekly meet
ings and various committees, the
Y. M. C. A., together with the
Y. YV. C. A., plays an influential part
in student life. Socially it gives
the first public reception to new
students each year ; its socials from

time to time offer an opportunity
to a large class of students, who
would otherwise be deprived, to se
cure some social advantages ; at the
joint Sunday evening meetings
there is a chance for students to
extend their acquaintance ; and the
outings, tramps, and picnics fur
nish a pleasant and congenial
means of recreation. Each year the
Christian Association get out a
hand-book, which gives informa
tion and statistics with regard to
the University, Palo Alto, boarding
places, etc. ; this is especially de
signed for prospective students. By
next year the V. M. C. A. plans to
take up the matter of student em
ployment, and to lend assistance to
those finding it necessary to sup
port themselves.
The report published today shows
that our Association has this year
become thoroughly organized. It
also shows what has been accom
plished and suggests what may be
done if the moral and material sup
port of students and faculty is given.
