# The
						Hawaiian Fish.
## 
### 
The collection of fish that was
received day before yesterday from
Honolulu, was begun last summer
by Mr. A. B. Wood assisted by Mr.
Keleipio, a native gentleman. It
was learned through Dr. Wood that
Mr. Keleipio is a very enthusiastic
friend of the University, and as
long as there is any chance to col
lect new specimens of fish he will
do so. As superintendent of the
Honolulu lish markets Mr. Kele
ipio has excellent opportunities for
collecting fis .
It might be of interest to state
that the natives of the Hawaiian
Islands look upon some of the salt
water tish as gods.
