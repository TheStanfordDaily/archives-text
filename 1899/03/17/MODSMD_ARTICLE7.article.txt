At a meeting of the Sophomore
Class, held yesterday, it was decided
after much debating to accept the
original agreement on baseball
schedule, and to play the Junior
Class on Junior Day. Another im
portant matter was brought up by
Track Captain Stewart, for provid
ing class numerals. It reads as
follows : "An}' man who wins a
place in a scratch event in a Uni
versity field-day, or makes the
Varsity Track Team, is entitled to
wear the numerals of his class."
This, Manager Stewart thought,
would stimulate ihe class enthu
siasm.
