# STANFORD ON TOP.
## Varsity Takes the Second Game From Fireman's Fund by Score of 4 to 1. 
### 
The Varsity won its third suc
cessive game on Saturday, when it
defeated the Fireman's Fund team
4-1. The play of both teams was
ragged at times, owing to the lack
of practice on account of the rain
last week.
The game showed again that
Lanagan is as strong a pitcher as
the nine ever had. His work Sat
urday was of the same grade as
that of the two previous victories.
It was alst) evident from the game
that the men all have learned how
to bat at the right time.
For the visitors Hammond, who
made two sensational catches at
center field, was the star player.
