Thkkk are some remarkably good
athletes at the Ukiah High School,
but the testimony of the Sopho
more track team speaks especially
for their courtesy and fairness. It
does not always happen that the
spirit of true sportsmanship is gen
eral in a high school, and there are
colleges, perhaps, where the spirit
is lacking. Hut the Ukiah athletes
jump and throw the weights no
better than the}' observe the laws of
hospitality. From the moment the
Sophomores landed at the Ukiah
depot, to the critical final arrange
ments at the track and on to their
departure the next day they re
ceived no treatment that was not
kind, fair, and generous. The efli
ciency of the field-day officials can
not go uncom mended. The dance
given the team by the people of
Ukiah was thoroughly enjoyable.
The ballroom was prettily decorated
in the combined colors of Stanford
and the home team, and the men of
'01 left the place reluctantly indeed
when the last waltz was played.
