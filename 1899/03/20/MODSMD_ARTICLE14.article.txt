# Sunday Sermon.

### 
Rev. (Jeorge B. Hatch of Berke
ley delivered the sermon in the
chapel Sunday morning, taking as
his text, "Ami let the heauty of the
Lord he upon us." The discourse
was exceedingly helpful.
"Possession of knowledge and

morality are high, worthy pur
poses," said the speaker. ''God is
beautiful, when contrasted with all
of the old pagan conceptions of
idols. And when the conceptions
of God which come to us are not fas
cinating and beautiful, the trouble
lies in the individual, and nowhere
else.
"Beauty does not come by acci
dent, but is a result of many cir
cumstances and causes. One with
love in his heart can not have an
unlovely thought of beauty. This
comes out of love and is in turn its
cause. There must be a cause for
beauty in one before he has it. To
possess a lovely heart is to be
truly educated and truly virtu
ous. Any collegiate degree, even
that of Doctor of Philosophy,
is thoroughly false if it be attained
at the expense of personal beauty.
Whatever one's position in life, his
fervent prayer should always be,
' Let the beauty of God be upon
me." For any problem, love is the
one and only solution. The only
way to reach men is through their
souls.
"The world has been more beau
tiful mice Christ came ; any life is
more beautiful after the glory of
God enters into it."
