# Student Volunteers.
## 
### 
Some time ago the Daily Palo
Alto published a request for in
formation regarding Stanford men
in the army. The responses have
been exceedingly meagre. It is the
intention to print the list in the
paper as soon as it is complete.
Now, also, the iyoo Annual Board
is desirous of securing the name of
every Stanford student who enlisted
in the regular or volunteer army
during the war with Spain. The
name of the company in which he
served, the date of his enlistment
and discharge is desired. The Board
wishes to give our student soldiers
proper representation in the book,
and the aid of everybody is asked
in making this list complete in as
short a time as possible. The
names of Co. K, First California
Volunteers, are easy to secure, but
those of the boys who left to enlist
in home companies in other parts
of the Union are not so generally
known. Any one knowing of the
enlistment of a student in any
other company than Co. K, First
California, is earnestly requested
to notify the Daily Palo Alto, or
the Annual Board, as soon as pos
sible.
