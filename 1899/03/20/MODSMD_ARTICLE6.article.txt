# Tuesday Evening- Lecture.

### 
The lecture Tuesday evening is to
be on " The Greek Lyric Art'' by
Prof. 11. It. Fairclough and will be
illustrated with extant specimens
of ancient Greek music. Mrs. E.
M. Pease will sing a portion of Pin
dar's first Pythian ode, the music
of which is the oldest Greek music
in existence. She will also sing the
Hymn to Apollo, which, with the
ancient musical notation, was found
engraved on marble by the French
archaeologists at Delphi in May,
1893. This hymn, originally com
posed in celebration of a victory
over Brennus the Gaul in 279 8.C.,
is the most complete specimen of
Greek music that has yet come to
light. To the musical student it is
an exceedingly interesting composi
tion, and in certain large centers,
as Athens, Paris, and London, has
been performed with a large chorus
and orchestra. Mrs. Hague and
Mr. Fred I)ti 1 ley will accompany
Mrs. Pease with piano and violin.
A choir will also sing some Gregor
ian chants, which many authorities
regard as descendants of the old
Greek modes. These chants, after
being handed down by oral tradi
tion, were first put into their exist
ing form by St. Ambrose in the
fourth century.
