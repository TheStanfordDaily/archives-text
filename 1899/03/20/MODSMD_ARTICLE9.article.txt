The field-day last Saturday be
tween the Ukiah High School and
the Class of '01 showed the pecu
liar strength and weaknesses of
both sides. By virtue of compara
tive records Ukiah possibly had the
best of the contest, but their show
ing in all the sprints was indiffer
ent. A wind blew up the stretch
throughout the meet, and conduced
with tbe poor condition of the
track, to make bad time in the
dashes. For Stanford, Stewart
showed remarkable form. Strout
won the quarter with a plucky
sprint in the last twenty-five yards
of the course. Morris'performance
in the mile was also good. For
Ukiah Nickolls, the hammer
thrower, and Henley, the all-round
athlete, were the stars. The hit
ter's performance in the broad

jump was excellent. His form was
good and he bids fair to break rec
ords some day.
