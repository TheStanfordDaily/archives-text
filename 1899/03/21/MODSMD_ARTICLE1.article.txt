# JUNIOR DAY.
## Farce, Address, Baseball Game, and Prom. Fill Out the Program. 
### 
The posters announcing the
Junior Day festivities are now out,
presenting a varied program, and
one that well tills out the day.
Beginning with the three-act col
lege farce, "Golf and Politics,"
written by John S. YV. Briscoe,
and ending with the Junior Prom.,
the day should be a most enjoyable
one.
The farce is based on the work of
the college politicians, who help
the hero, Parmenas Hoyle, a frater
nity man, into the position of
president of the Associated Stu
dents. Hoyle does not care for this
office for itself, but has a promise
from his aunt Marguerite that he
can have his debts paid if lie gets
elected. On this plot hang most of
the situations, though the " royal
and ancient game of golf" comes
in for its share of glory.
There are several character parts
drawn from the people seen about
the quad. Among them is Mac-
Donald MacDuffy MacSwatt, a pro
fessor much given to golf, also a
Miss Cordelia Biceps, an athletic
co-ed who has Education as a
major and who, at times, worships
at the shrine of Cupid. Slickens
is the name of a gentleman of
taking address —a bill collector,
who is introduced into the farce,
and it is owing to his blunders as
a detective that many of the com
plications arise.
The second scene of the second
act will he extremely realistic. It
will show the Pickaxhandle and
Giantpowder Golf Links, with Lake
Lagunita in the background. It
is during this scene that Miss
Biceps attempts suicide by jump
ing into the lake, but is immedi
ately rescued by the irrepressible
Slickens, who covers himself with
glory, honor, gold medals, and mud.
The following students will take
part: H L. Ross,'ol; F. B. Braden,
'00; Eugene Warren, '01; F. B.
Riley, '00; G. 11. Forsythe, '99; G.
A. McDougald, '02; Clifton Faris,
'00; F. H. Wright, '01; W. M. Erb,
'01; G. P. Roberts, '00; A. Has
lacher, '00; C. B. Strohn, '00;
Teddy Berwick, '02; J. S. Briscoe,
'00; Miss Bessie Henry, '00; Miss
Jessie Haskell, '00; Miss Stella
Rose, '02.
The cast of characters will be
given in tomorrow's issue.
After lunch President Harper, of
Chicago University, will deliver an
address in the chapel. President
Harper is making a tour of the
State, and it was with great diffi
culty that he was secured for this
date. No admission will be charged
for this event, and a large crowd
will probably attend.
Following close upon the address
will l»e the Interclass baseball game.
This will be close and interesting,
as it is the final match of the cham
pionship series. The Sophomore
team has had considerable practice
in the two preliminary games just
played, and should put up a good
game.
The Junior team has not played
together this year, but owing to the
fact that it is composed mostly of
men who practice every day, they

will, when pitted against their so
fur successful opponents, he able to
make a strong fight for the cham
pionship. There is no counter
attraction upon the afternoon of
the 24th, so no reason exists why
the grandstand should not be filled
by a large crowd of enthusiastic
students. The make-up of the
teams will probably be as follows:
'01. '00.
Swindells. .Catcher Strohn
Bennett. . . . Pitcher Lanagan
Bentley .... First Base Boyd
Wilson Second Base..Chandler
Edwards.. .Third Base. . .Murphy
Diviny Short Stop. . Lougheed
Symonds.. . Left Field Hawley
Beckley.... Center Field. . . Braden
Erb Right Field Coffin
Every indication points to a suc
cessful From, in the evening. Mr.
Lanagan, as chairman of the From.
Committee, will have charge of the
arrangements.
