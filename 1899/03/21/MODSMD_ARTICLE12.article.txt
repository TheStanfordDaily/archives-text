The generous gift of Mr. Motiitt
must not be allowed to pass with
out recognition. The students of
both universities and all who are
interested in them and their devel
opment in debating all realize the
debt of gratitude they are under;
and expression of that gratitude in
these columns is only that Mr.
Mollitt and others outside may
know that we realize it.
