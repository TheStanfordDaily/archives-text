The question as to where the
Intercollegiate Field-day shall he
held this year is as yet undecided,
but it should be determined at
once. The longer such questions
are left, the harder it becomes for a
settlement to be reached, because
with the approach of the day of the
contest the managers of the two
teams, as has been shown in former
years, become more and more
suspicious of each others actions,
and amicable agreement is not to
be thought of.
As a bicycle track has been con
structed inside the Olympic track,
cutting off the view and hindering,
if not prohibiting, the hammer
throw, the teams can not compete
there as in former years. There is
no other suitable track in San
Francisco, which leaves practically
only two locations for considera
tion —the two college tracks. The
question of holding the track and
lield meet on one of the college
campuses has been seriously con
sidered for several years, so that
the move, if it is made, will not be
unexpected or in any way dis
agreeable. The only question lett
is which track shall be selected for
the iirst meet. Neither at present
is enclosed nor has sufficient grand
stand accommodations. Berkeley's
track has live laps to the mile, with
the consequent disagreeable sharp
curves, which are not present in
our own. At the present time, too,
our track is in better shape than

their*, although either track, after
the selection is made, can be put
into shape for the meet. One pos
sible advantage that the U. (J.
track would have for the first year
after the change, is its nearness to
San Francisco, although it is not at
all improbable that enough people
would come to Stanford from San
Jose to more than makeup for this.
Either track would be acceptable to
all concerned ; only it would be
well to decide now.
