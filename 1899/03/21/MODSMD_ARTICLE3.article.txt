# Musical Clubs Tour.
## 
### 
The Varsity musical clubs are
rounding in excellent form for the
northern tour of which the first
performance is given Saturday
night, March 25, in Santa Rosa.
Rehearsals have been held every
day for the last two weeks and the
men are prepared to repeat the suc
cess scored in the northern part of
the State two years ago. Much en
thusiasm has been aroused all along
the route and assurances of a hearty
welcome have been sent from every
point. Charles Mannon, '98, the
advance agent chosen by the Asso
ciated Students, has announced the
itenerary of the tour completed.
It includes seven towns, Chico be
ing the northernmost point. Full
details of the trip will be published
tomorrow.
