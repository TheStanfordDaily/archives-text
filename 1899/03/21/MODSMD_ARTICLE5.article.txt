# EXHIBITION GAME.
## Varsity to Meet Coach Borcher's San Jose Profesionals Thursday. 
### 
If the weather permits, on next
Thursday there will be an exhibi
tion game on the campus, between
the Varsity and the San Jose pro
fessional team.
This team, of which Coach
Borchers is captain and pitcher, is
the one that will represent San Jose
in the California League, which be
gins to play in about two weeks.
It is probably a strong team, and
will very likely give the college
nine a harder game than they have
had to play this year.
The game will be especially inter
esting as showing what our batters
can do against a good team they
have not faced before. It is not
known yet who will pitch for the
Varsity, but Lanagan will in all
probability pitch at least part of
the game.
