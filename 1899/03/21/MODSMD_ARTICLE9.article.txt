—The senior classes of Michigan
and Harvard are having quite a
discussion over the question of con
tinuing the custom of wearing caps
and gowns. Harvard voted pro
visionally to wear them after May
1. Of the question the Harvard
Crimson says editorially: "That it
is good to follow picturesque cus
toms, of which we have too few, is
easily true. Whether or not it
adds a desirable academic force,
and the 500 seniors that have pre
viously existed only in the cata
logue suddenly materialize, is a
matter of personal opinion."
