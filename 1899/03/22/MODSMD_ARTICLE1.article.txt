Preparations for the fourth an-;

about completed. Charles Man- 1
non, '98, the advance agent, has re
turned from the north and an
nounces a series of seven concerts.
According to the schedule the clubs,
composed of twenty-six men, in
cluding the treasurer (Fickert), and i

iiosa, where the opening conceit
will be given in theevening. Man
lion reports a bright outlook in
Santa Rosa.
The clubs will spend Sunday in
Napa and play there Monday even
ing. (Jeorge Francis, '98, and other
Stanford sympathizers are plan
ning an enthusiastic reception for
the clubs here and the success of
the concert seems assured. This is
the first appearance of the clubs in
both Santa Rosa and Napa. Sac
ramento is booked for Tuesday
night. The town is full of Stan
ford people, who it is expected will
arouse as great an interest in the
ad\ent of the Stanford men as was
displayed two years ago.
Great things are expected of
Chico and Marysville, which have
been booked for Wednesday and
Thursday respectively.
A reception and dance will be
tendered the clubs by the towns
people in each place.
Friday evening will find the
clubs in Oroville, and the last con
cert will be given in Woodland the
following night. Little is known
of the last two named'towns, as this
is the first appearance of the or
ganizations in either place, but the
advance agent is confident that the
siubs will be greeted with good
houses on both nights. The men
will return to col lege on Sunday, in
time for work Monday morning.
The advertising for the tour con
sists of a small double sheet with
cuts of the clubs, names of mem
bers, press notices, and a sample
program. These will be scattered
generally in public places about the
towns visited. There are also win
dow cards with cuts of the clubs, a
one-sheet poster, and a series of ex
cellent carbon photographs of Riley
and Culver in character.
The clubs are well prepared for
the trip, and will present a program
up to the standard. Both clubs
have been rehearsing daily, and
have some bright, new pieces.
Frank Riley, '00, whose mono
logues and songs have been a bright
feature of the concerts for three
years, will attend to two numbers
of the program. R. K. Culver, '99,
will add much variety to the per
formance l>y liis clever "Marks and
Remarks." Leader VanKaathoven
will sing a coon song, with banjo
accompaniment. His cello will also
be heard this year in the Mandolin
Club. There will be a double quar
tet from the Glee to sing some of
the old favorites.
The iist of men selected to make
the tiip will probably be announced
tomorrow.
