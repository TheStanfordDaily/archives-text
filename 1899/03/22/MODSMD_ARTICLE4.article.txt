# GREEK LYRIC ART.
## Professor Fairclough Delivers an Interesting Lecture in the Chapel With Musical Illustrations. 
### 
Professor Fairclough gave last
evening his lecture on "Greek Lyric
Art," reviewing its origin and de
velopment from the time of Tyr
taeus and Arclulochus through to
its minor place in the dramas of
Euripide.*. Tne lecture has already
been published in parts in an article
in l< A Library of the World's Best
Literature,'' under the head: "Tyr
taeus, Archilochus, and their Hue
cessors in the Development of the
Greek Lyric."
Reference to that article will give
the more critical portions of the
lecture, and also many of the
translations which made this study
of the classic unusually pleasant
even to those uneducated in
knowledge of the Greeks. .
The feature of the lecture that
lifted it entirely beyond the routine
of the usual study was the intro
duction of musical illustrations.
Mr. Dulley on the violin and Mrs.
Hague on the piano illustrated the
notes and compass of each Greek
instrument as it was described. The
chorus of six voices suggested the
methods and forces of the Greek
chorus. And of very much more
than technical value were the
hymns to Apollo, sung by Mrs.
Pease. Tlie.se gave to the lecture
an added art that impressed through
the finest feeling the admiration
for the purity and genius of the
Greek song.
Professor Fairclough defined the
early Greek Lyric with its unifica
tion of music, dancing, and song,
in the first part of his lecture he
told the various schools of song and
their great representatives. These
poets are today without successors
of their kind. Only Swinburne, in
some of his poetry, as "On the
Cliffs.'' has come worthily near the
great passionate model of Sappho.
The second element, the dancing,
was emphasized in its difference
from the dancing of today. "Danc
ing, to our mind, implies tripping
it 'on the light, fantastic toe,' often
with little reason and less grace.
But in Greece the term applied to
all movements of the body which
were intended to aid in the inter
pretation of poetry, or the expres
sion of emotion. Thus gestures,
postures, and attitudes were most
important forms of dancing, and
in dance movements the hands and
arms played a much larger part
than the feet. Aristotle tells us
that dancers imitate actions, char
acters and passions by means of
gestures and rythmic, motion. Thus
the spirit which animates Greek
mythology and Greek art- the de
sire to give form and body to men
tal ((inceptions — is characteristic
of Greek dancing "
Lastly, Professor Faircloujih gaye
the study of the (Jreek music, the
instruments, and the methods :
" As to Greek music, it, too, was
very different from ours, but in
this sphere the advantage certainly
lies with the modern art. In the
best period of Greek poetry, the
only mu-ical -truments were
practically the I re and the flute,
the former being much preferred
because it allowed the same person

to sing and play. Other string in
struments were variations of the
lyre, and depended on the same
principle. The flute was stronger
and shriller than our modern flute.
Flutes varied in length, and a
double Mute was often used. The
syrinx, or Pan's pipe, was a flute
with seven reeds of different lengths,
giving the seven notes of the scale.
For special effect the trumpet was
introduced ; also the drum and
cymbals."
Concerning more intimately the
methods : " The Greeks understood
and employed harmonies. In the
best days of Greek song, however,
harmony seems to have been little
more than a matter of octaves,
fourths and fifths the only con
cords, it is said, that the Japanese
have today. But though the
Greeks were far inferior to us in
harmony, they developed melody
to an extraordinary degree."
As a whole, Professor Fairclough
characterized his subject —*'As a
body of literature, Greek poetry is
the richest legacy that the modern
world has received from ancient
times."
