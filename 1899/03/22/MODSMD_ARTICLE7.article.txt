East and West, wherever college
affairs are considered of interest,
President Harper of the University
of Chicago is known as a leader in
advanced educational work. In the
East, where scholarship commands
a premium, he was one who, as
professor of Semitic languages at
Yale, helped to raise <>ld standards
and arouse new interest. In the
West, when a great endowment
awaited only a master hand to
apply it to the best advantage in
the founding of a university, his rare
executive ability proved the wisdom
of his appointment to its presidency.
The Chautauqua movement of the
East, and the University Extension
system of the West, owe much to the
energy of his assistance, and the
wisdom of his planning. In his
own university he is the friend and
adviser of the very large propor
tion of students who know him
personally. So live a factor is he
in university life and thought in
America, that few of us will care
to miss the opportunity which we
will have on Friday to hear this
friend and leader of students speak
to us as students.
