'Phis heavy and continuous rain
is a blessing for farmers and in
sures prosperity for SSthe tate next
year, 1 >ut it is not so good for the
immediate purposes of Stanford
University students just now. It
is somewhat seriously interfering
with several branches of our athletic
activity at a time when we would
wish, if we had only our own inter
ests to consult, to be especially hard
at work. It has been, of course,
impossible for men to do anything
on the diamond, track, or court,
and from present conditions it will
remain so for several dnys longer.
It is quite evident that the game
scheduled for the Viirsity against

the San Jose Professionals tomor
row is off, as also the track meet
between the Freshmen and Oakland
High School. It is almost certain,
too, that the baseball game between
the Juniors und Sophomores, which
was to fill out the afternoon of
Junior Day, will have to be declared
off. As for the former difficulties,
all that can be done is to wait with
all possible patience, and then when
the rain stops to get out and work
with redoubled vigor to make up
for lost time. It would be too bad,
however, to allow the afternoon of
next Friday to pass without some
sort of "festivity." If it is impos
sible to have anything out of doors,
why not have some sort of an im
promptu program in the chapel
after President Harper's address ?
Anything, so long as there is some
thing doing and time does not drag.
We have several musical clubs,
two of which are at the end of a
time of preparation for a trip which
they are about to take. They could
give a " farewell concert."
