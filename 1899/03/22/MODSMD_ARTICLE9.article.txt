# Junior Day "Sequoia."
## 
### 
The next issue of the Se<juoia is
the special Junior Day number,
which will naturally deal largely
with matters pertaining to the re
cently re-created University holi
day.
There is a very attractive cover
design to begin with, and the
editorial column is devoted exclu
sively to the day. The Arcadian
Echo is the ruminations of ' Senior"
on the present and the past, and
the relative degress of satisfaction
and self-satisfaction experienced in
being a junior and a senior, with
a decision in favor of the former.
The program for Junior Day is
published in full, with a synopsis
of the farce.
In this number, Robert Hart
well's "Volunteer Vanities," which
has been running for six issues, and
has elicited much favorable com
ment, is concluded.
