A prize for the best essay on a
Revolutionary topic has been of
fered by the Daughters of the Rev
olution to the women of the Junior
Class. Such an offer ought not to
go longer unheeded. The distinc
tion of winning in a contest of this
sort would be considerable for the
individual and would contribute in
a corresponding degree to the honor
of Stanford. There are fifteen
women in the Class of 11)00 who
are history majors. Why do not this
fifteen, at least, compete ?
