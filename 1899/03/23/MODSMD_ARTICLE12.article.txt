We notice in several of our ex
changes from the various prep,
schools on the Coast recently letters
from some of the "old boys" who
are in Stanford now. This is a
good thing and men who come here
from these schools can do good mis
sionary work by getting boys who
are going to be strong men in col
lege interested in the University be
fore they graduate from the prepar
atory schools. These letters tell of
what different fellows from the
school written to are doing in col
lege and make the readers of the
letters feel as if they were already
somewhat acquainted with the stu
dent body here and have common
interests. And men make their
choice of a college while they are
in the school.
