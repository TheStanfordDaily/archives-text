The Annual Intercollegiate Field
day takes place in just a month,
four weeks from Saturday. The
first provisional list of men from
whom the mem Ik-is of the teams
will he chosen must he submitted
hy the two managements in a week
now according to the intercollegiate
agreement. This means practi
cally that our team must he se
lected from men who have already
appeared on the track, an all too
meagre number. Bui now is no
time to inclulge in regrets From

the men who are training now, a
stronger team can he picked than
ever represented the University he
fore. The team from present indi
cations will not he especially weak
in any branches, unless it he in the
weights, and postihly in the hur
dles. New candidates are needed
ill both these events. A month is
too short a time to develop either
a weights man or a hurdler, hut
something at least might he done
toward next year's teams. As for
this year, all that is done must be
by the men whose names are sent
up to Berkeley next week. Every
man who has any aspirations of
making the team should see that
his name is in the hands of the
captain or manager immediately.
