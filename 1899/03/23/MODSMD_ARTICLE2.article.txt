# Track Prospects.
## 
### 
The rain lias prevented all work
on the track and field this week
and every day is now valuable to
ill. men. The date of the field-day
is only a month off now and the
men are not nearly in condition.
Today permission was obtained to
use the covered track in the run
ning farm, and buses will take the
men down there during the rain,
leaving Encina at 4:o0 o'clock.
From now on a good deal, of hard
sharp work must be done, which
will be begun as soon as the track
is in condition after the rain. The
track now is in better condition
than it has been before this se«son.
A number of good men have been
brought out from the Freshmen,
whose work is likely in the next
month to put them on the Varsity
team.
As usual at Stanford there is no
dearth of distance men, both the
mile and the half having a full
complement of candidates, many
of whom have already made good
time. In the quarter there is room
for a good man. The sprints will
probably be well cared for. In fact
the team is stronger in the fiat races
than in any other department.
In the hurdles the best men are
Dole, Culver, Strout, '01.
Symonds, '01, and Bowman, 01.
Lous ley a nd W right a ret he only
men in the walk who have proven
their ability, although Jones, Ber
wick, and Wilson have been train
ing and show signs of future
ability.
The weights are weak and more
candidates must be brought out.
In the jumps and pole vault it is
yet too early to predict who will
prove the best men, but it is safe to
say the team will not be weak.
Prospects are encouraging, but

not fluttering. Much work must
lie done to obtain a team that will
meet U. C. on equal terms.
