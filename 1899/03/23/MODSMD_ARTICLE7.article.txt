The White and dold, of Mills
College, in a recent issue, nays: '" The
Â»S'equina leads western college maga
zines in the short story." The
Cornell Magazine says: "Sequoia.
maintains its excellence in 'One of
the Stanford Men,'and 'The Story
of a Volunteer.'" The Charleston
(S. C.) Magazine m\yw : ''TheStan
ford Sequoia, from far California,
is rather a departure in the line of
college magazines. A weekly liter
ary paper is unusual ; in fact, this
is the only one with which we are
acquainted. Its articles are excel
lent. In two of the numbers re
ceived appeared an artiele on 'Kip
ling and College Journalism,' which
is remarkably well done. The gen
eral appearance of the Sequoia is
very pleasing."
