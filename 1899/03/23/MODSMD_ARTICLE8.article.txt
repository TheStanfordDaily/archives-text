# ABOUT THE GROUNDS.
## Not Likely That Thanksgiving Game will be Played at Either University. 
### 
A column article appeared in a
San Francisco paper this morning
headed: "No Grounds for the Big
Game," which states that as neither
Central Park nor Recreation Park
can be secured, the annual game
between the two universities may
not he played in San Francisco at
all.
Manager Berry when seen about
the mailer today said that there is
just enough truth in it to attract
attention and enough fiction to
make it hardly worth while to pay
any attention to it. He said:
"It is true that Mr. Muma and
I have been unable to seeure lie
creation l'ark for the preliminary
games next season, but there are
several other places obtainable with
the single disadvantage of being
somewhat less accessible. There
are many points, however, which
are strongly favorable to a change,
the most important being the far
greater seating capacity of the other
grounds.
" Mr. Muma and I have received
three proposals, any one of which
would be entirely suitable. One
gentleman has indicated his will
ingness to erect all necessary grand
stands. thus relieving the two uni
versities of a very considerable ex
pense. There is yet a possibility of
securing Central Park.
" I am sure the people who have
attended the games in the past
would not remain away from the
Thanksgiving games of the future
merely because of a difference in
time of fifteen minutes' ride on the
street cars, especially since with
this little additional inconvenience
the patrons will be sure of seats.''
