# Alumnae Entertain Seniors.
## 
### 
Over a hundred Berkeley and
Stanford women of the Class of '99
were the guests of the California
branch of the Association of Col
legiate Alumnae on Saturday,
March '25. The reception was held
at the home of Mrs. Charles \V.
Slack in San Francisco. The pres
ident, Miss McLean, in welcoming
the seniors, spoke cordially of the
pleasure with which they would be
received into the national fraternity
of college women upon their grad
uation.
The feature of the day was the
paper read by Miss Lillie J. Mar
tin, on "Personal Experiences in
the Psychological Laboratories of
Germany." Her experiences are
well worth the telling, in that she
is the only woman who has at
tained the honor of collaborating
with the noted German psychol
ogist, Professor G. E. Muller. Their
book, "Zur Analyse dor Unter
sehit 11 seinpiilld 1 ic-hkeit,which is
to appear soon, will be one of the
most valuable of recent additions
to the literature of the subject.
In the hour of social pleasure
which followed the paper, Miss
Dolly Pasmore and Ruth Powers
entertained the guests further with
solos on the cello and piano.
