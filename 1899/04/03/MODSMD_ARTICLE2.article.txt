"We, as alumni of Stanford Uni
versity assembled at tiie fourth an
nual business meeting of the San
Francisco Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation, wish to express to you,
dear Mrs. Stanford, our sympathy
for you during the present illness
of your brother, and at the same
time we want you to know that as
alumni we are no less loyal to you
and to the University than in the
days when we were enthusiastic un
dergraduates at Palo Alto.
Friday, March 31, I<S9!), 10:30 p.m.
To the Members of the Sun Fron
euro Stanford Alumni Association.
Kind Friends: Your sympathetic
words, your strengthening thoughts,
came at a time when 1 most needed
them. Such Christian acts, I be
lieve, are horn from a higher source
than earthly influences. They come
from a loving, tender Heavenly
Father, who looks down with pity
that we poor mortals <>112 earth walk
in darkness and know not that the

hand that afllicts, afllicts but for
the good that is to follow the effect
of the discipline. My trust in God
and in his beloved Son has taught
me that the dreaded monster,
which we of earth call Death, is
but re-birth into a higher, bet
ter existence in the life be
yond. While 1 believe this, still
1 suffer at the thought of having to
part with another loved one â€”part
in the sense that my physical eyes
shall not behold him; that 1 shall
not have the sweet communion in
person, face to face, that has been
my privilege through many years
past; but I believe most truly that
soon there will be added to the
loved circle beyond another angel
who will love me ever, who will
minister to my sick, lonely heart,
who will keep me to hear the cares
and responsibilities which God in
llis wisdom has seen tit to place
upon me.
May I humbly ask that you, my
loyal, loving sons and brothers,
will not only give to me your
strengthening thoughts and pray
ers, but with deep humility 1 ask
that you will pray for the soul of
the one who is now crossing the
liver of life, that he may receive
God's mercy and blessing. Your
grateful friend,
Mrs. Leland Stanford.
San Francisco, Cal., April 1, 1898.
