# JUNIOR DAY EXERCISES.
## The
						Heavy Rain Did Not Prevent 1900 from Having a Successful Gala Day. 
### 
Everything scheduled for Junior
Day passed oft' very satisfactorily
with the exception of the Sopho
more-Junior baeebai I game, which
was postponed indefinitely, and
['resident Harper's address, which
was delivered in the chapel at
eleven o'clock on Saturday morn
ing.
In spite of the bad weather, the
Farce was very well attended. It
was an exceedingly good show and
those who were connected with it
deserve credit. Clever situations
and pleasantries were distributed
throughout, keeping the audience
in good humor. Briscoe was the
star of the performance, and Riley,
McDougald, Korsythe, aud Wright
followed closely. The three young
ladies, Miss Christina Hose, Miss
Jessie Haskell, and Miss Bessie
Henry, played their parts well.
The l'romenade in the evening
was one of the prettiest class dances
in the history of the college. Every
detail of the party had been well
attended to. Yanke's music was
all that could be desired. The pro
grams were dainty and of conven
ient size. There were twenty regular
dances, tour extras and two grabs.
The decorations consisted of wide
streamers of red, white, and blue
draped from the famous and huge
"piug ugly'' which was suspended
from the center of the roof. Greens
were used liberally and the class
numerals were displayed by means
of junior plugs hung against the
west wall. The floor was in remark
a hly good condition considering the
difficulties that had to be overcome
after the Farce closed in tlie morn
ing.
financially, both Farce and
I'romt nade were successful, a bal
ance being netted in each case.
President Harper of the Univer
sity of Chicago spoke in the chapel
on Saturday morning. He com
pared the different plans of organ
ization of Stanford and Chicago,
dwelling pacticularly on the con
tinuous four-semester scheme of
instruction in vogue at Chicago.
He also compared the different
conditions under which students
attend universities in the East and
in the West.
l)r Harper spoke only briefly,
and closed with a glowing tribute
to the Founders and President of
Stanford.
