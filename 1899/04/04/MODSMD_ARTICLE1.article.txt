# MUSICAL CLUBS TOUR.
## Easter Week's Concerts Were Very Successfulâ€”Small Deficit Resulted. 
### 
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
arrived in San Francisco from
Woodland Sunday morning and
returned to the campus on various
trains during the day. The men
are much pleased over the splendid
receptions accorded the clubs all
along the route. The flattering
accounts of the concerts received
from each point have given some
idea of the excellent impression
the organizations made in the
north. Some of the towns had
never been visited before and the
welcome received in these places
was especially gratifying.
The opening concert in Santa
llosa was the proverbial lirst night
frost. The date conflicted with
other important local events and
the audience, which would have
made a respectable showing in a
hall, was almost lost in the im
mense barn-like structure in which
the clubs played. In spite of this
depressing influence, the clubs gave
a good concert and pleased those
present.
The following Monday night in
Napa, the theatre was packed to
the doors and the "standing room
only" sign displayed. The men
were in splendid form after a Sun
day's rest in Santa Rosa, and
aroused the audience to the great
est enthusiasm. Treble recalls
were the order of the evening, an.l
the audience seemed loath to let the
program end. Much of the finan
cial success of the concert was due
to the efforts of Geo. Francis, '1)8,
and the Cyclers' Club, under whose
auspices the show was given. An
enjoyable dancing party was given
in honor of the Stanford men after
the concert.
Sacramento was an agreeable
surprise. The short time in which
the clubs had been advertised and
the close proximity of the date to
the advent of the Ellis Opera Com
pany, had prepared the men for a
slim house. Instead the cozy
Clunic Theater was filled with what
the press called "a thoroughly rep
resentative Sacramento audience."
The concert, in point of merit, was
perhaps the best of the tour and
the audience encored the program
until it was more than doubled.
The clubs and specia lists gave a feu
numbers for the High School dur
ing the afternoon, which proved a
good finishing touch to the adver
tizing. The men were entertained
in the best homes of the city, thus
Saving their hotel expenses. To
Magee, I HB, Van Voorhies, 'ex-00,
and Fa l is, 'iHI, belong the credit
for arranging this and other pleas
ant features of the visit.
The company left Sacramento by
an early train for Marysville, where
they spent the day in trying to
swell what was found to be a rather
small advance sale. The Lenten
season here affected the size of the
house, which was not as large as
was expected.
From Marysville the clulw took
the pleasant Itttle ride to Oroville,
where the conditions were quite
different. A large brass band
met the clubs at the station with
banners bearing the inscription

"Stanfords tonight," and escorted
the troup, followed by a retinue of
small boys, down the principal
streets between long lines of gaily
dressed townspeople, who displayed
the cardinal and gave the "Stan
fords" a good welcome. The whole
town wore a circus-day air. At
the hotel corner the band played,
the Clubs rallied around the musi
cians in true college style, cheered
the band, gave the yell, and sang.
The entire population seemed to be
present at the festivities. The last
seat for the concert was sold before
the time of beginning the program.
The audience received the concert
in a way that brought the best foot
of the clubs forward, and the good
will of Oroville was won. A dance
was given after the concert.
Next morning the journey to
Chico was made by stage, instead
of by railroad as was first ar
ranged. The road lay through the
heart of a beautiful country, and
this ride overland was one of the
most pleasant features of the tour.
At Chico a short program was
given before the large State Nor
mal School in the afternoon, which
helped to increase the already good
advance sale. The Clubs' success
at Chico two years ago had its
effect, and the people turned out
well to give the boys a warm wel
come on their return. 'The concert
was given in the large Armory
Mali, and was followed by a dance.
The departure from Chico was
made at 6 o'clock in the morning
and there was a wait of four hours
at Marysville for a connecting train
to Woodland, the last stopping
place on the tour.
The experience in the pretty town
of Woodland may be said to have
been the pleasantest of the week.
Jt was the clubs' first visit there.
Warning had been given that the
town was "all for Berkeley" and the
men were prepared for a cold recep
tion. Instead the whole city was
particularly cordial. The sale of
seats began to swell as soon as the
clubs arrived. They made their
presence known by a drive over
the town in a big tally-ho with
banners. Much to the surprise of
the theater management and the
clubs, a full house awaited the open
ing of the concert in the evening,
it proved the most responsive audi
ence of the tour. The men, inspired
by the unlooked-for reception, gave
a performance above the average,
and the audience encored it to three
times its length. The paper in the
morning chronicled the taking of
a ''Berkeley town by Stanford stu
dents."
W hen the men boarded the ferry
boat at the Oakland mole, they as
sembled at one end with their bag
gage and sang and played. The
impromptu college concert drew
the passengers from every corner of
the boat and left the poor profes
sional Italian musicians without
listeners at the other end of the
salon. The clubs noticing this an
nounced that they would pass
about the hat for the benefit of the
musicians whose business they had
temporarily spoiled. A shower of
coin was poured into the hats of the
fellows and was presented to the
Italians amid the applause of the
passengers.

The quality of the program was
very good. The Glee began in con
cert form and improved every day.
The Mandolin Club never failed to
score a hit., in some places it was
recalled until its repertoire was com
pletely exhausted. A. J. Van
Kaathoven's cello added a rich, new
sweetness and volume to the music,
his coon song always pleased. A
new feature was the accompaniment
of banjos, played S. P. Hardy and
Harold Mann.
Frank Branch Riley was at his
best and could always be depended
on to put the house in the best of
humor. His monologues, humor
ous and pathetic, won the enthusi
astic approval of every audience,
and he was recalled again and
again. R. K. Culver's number was
an entirely new and novel feature
of the program, and his clever car
toons and drawings, accompanied
by his bright explanations of the
same, were much enjoyed.

Mali, and was followed by a dance.
The departure from Chico was
made at 6 o'clock in the morning
and there was a wait of four hours
at Marysville for a connecting train
to Woodland, the last stopping
place on the tour.
The experience in the pretty town
of Woodland may be said to have
been the pleasantest of the week.
Jt was the clubs' first visit there.
Warning had been given that the
town was "all for Berkeley" and the
men were prepared for a cold recep
tion. Instead the whole city was
particularly cordial. The sale of
seats began to swell as soon as the
clubs arrived. They made their
presence known by a drive over
the town in a big tally-ho with
banners. Much to the surprise of
the theater management and the
clubs, a full house awaited the open
ing of the concert in the evening,
it proved the most responsive audi
ence of the tour. The men, inspired
by the unlooked-for reception, gave
a performance above the average,
and the audience encored it to three
times its length. The paper in the
morning chronicled the taking of
a ''Berkeley town by Stanford stu
dents."
W hen the men boarded the ferry
boat at the Oakland mole, they as
sembled at one end with their bag
gage and sang and played. The
impromptu college concert drew
the passengers from every corner of
the boat and left the poor profes
sional Italian musicians without
listeners at the other end of the
salon. The clubs noticing this an
nounced that they would pass
about the hat for the benefit of the
musicians whose business they had
temporarily spoiled. A shower of
coin was poured into the hats of the
fellows and was presented to the
Italians amid the applause of the
passengers.

The quality of the program was
very good. The Glee began in con
cert form and improved every day.
The Mandolin Club never failed to
score a hit., in some places it was
recalled until its repertoire was com
pletely exhausted. A. J. Van
Kaathoven's cello added a rich, new
sweetness and volume to the music,
his coon song always pleased. A
new feature was the accompaniment
of banjos, played S. P. Hardy and
Harold Mann.
Frank Branch Riley was at his
best and could always be depended
on to put the house in the best of
humor. His monologues, humor
ous and pathetic, won the enthusi
astic approval of every audience,
and he was recalled again and
again. R. K. Culver's number was
an entirely new and novel feature
of the program, and his clever car
toons and drawings, accompanied
by his bright explanations of the
same, were much enjoyed.
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
arrived in San Francisco from
Woodland Sunday morning and
returned to the campus on various
trains during the day. The men
are much pleased over the splendid
receptions accorded the clubs all
along the route. The flattering
accounts of the concerts received
from each point have given some
idea of the excellent impression
the organizations made in the
north. Some of the towns had
never been visited before and the
welcome received in these places
was especially gratifying.
The opening concert in Santa
llosa was the proverbial lirst night
frost. The date conflicted with
other important local events and
the audience, which would have
made a respectable showing in a
hall, was almost lost in the im
mense barn-like structure in which
the clubs played. In spite of this
depressing influence, the clubs gave
a good concert and pleased those
present.
The following Monday night in
Napa, the theatre was packed to
the doors and the "standing room
only" sign displayed. The men
were in splendid form after a Sun
day's rest in Santa Rosa, and
aroused the audience to the great
est enthusiasm. Treble recalls
were the order of the evening, an.l
the audience seemed loath to let the
program end. Much of the finan
cial success of the concert was due
to the efforts of Geo. Francis, '1)8,
and the Cyclers' Club, under whose
auspices the show was given. An
enjoyable dancing party was given
in honor of the Stanford men after
the concert.
Sacramento was an agreeable
surprise. The short time in which
the clubs had been advertised and
the close proximity of the date to
the advent of the Ellis Opera Com
pany, had prepared the men for a
slim house. Instead the cozy
Clunic Theater was filled with what
the press called "a thoroughly rep
resentative Sacramento audience."
The concert, in point of merit, was
perhaps the best of the tour and
the audience encored the program
until it was more than doubled.
The clubs and specia lists gave a feu
numbers for the High School dur
ing the afternoon, which proved a
good finishing touch to the adver
tizing. The men were entertained
in the best homes of the city, thus
Saving their hotel expenses. To
Magee, I HB, Van Voorhies, 'ex-00,
and Fa l is, 'iHI, belong the credit
for arranging this and other pleas
ant features of the visit.
The company left Sacramento by
an early train for Marysville, where
they spent the day in trying to
swell what was found to be a rather
small advance sale. The Lenten
season here affected the size of the
house, which was not as large as
was expected.
From Marysville the clulw took
the pleasant Itttle ride to Oroville,
where the conditions were quite
different. A large brass band
met the clubs at the station with
banners bearing the inscription

"Stanfords tonight," and escorted
the troup, followed by a retinue of
small boys, down the principal
streets between long lines of gaily
dressed townspeople, who displayed
the cardinal and gave the "Stan
fords" a good welcome. The whole
town wore a circus-day air. At
the hotel corner the band played,
the Clubs rallied around the musi
cians in true college style, cheered
the band, gave the yell, and sang.
The entire population seemed to be
present at the festivities. The last
seat for the concert was sold before
the time of beginning the program.
The audience received the concert
in a way that brought the best foot
of the clubs forward, and the good
will of Oroville was won. A dance
was given after the concert.
Next morning the journey to
Chico was made by stage, instead
of by railroad as was first ar
ranged. The road lay through the
heart of a beautiful country, and
this ride overland was one of the
most pleasant features of the tour.
At Chico a short program was
given before the large State Nor
mal School in the afternoon, which
helped to increase the already good
advance sale. The Clubs' success
at Chico two years ago had its
effect, and the people turned out
well to give the boys a warm wel
come on their return. 'The concert
was given in the large Armory
Mali, and was followed by a dance.
The departure from Chico was
made at 6 o'clock in the morning
and there was a wait of four hours
at Marysville for a connecting train
to Woodland, the last stopping
place on the tour.
