# U. C. Field-Day.

### 
The Tenth Annual Champion
ship Field-day ot the University of
California was held on their track
on last Saturday afternoon. In
connection with this championship
field-day points were counted for
the Sophomore-Freshman inter
class contest.
With the exception of Flaw's
hammer throw of 150 feet 7 inches,
no very remarkable records were
established. Hut the average of
the performances was high, especi
ally when it is noticed that a good
many of the first places were taken
by new men, and that the old men
upon whom Berkeley relies for the
majority of her points in the inter
collegiate meet either did not com
pete or allowed more inexperienced
men to win first places.
It is evident that unless the
weights men here make remarkable
progress, we shall be unable to win
even a third place in either of these
events.
Flaw's hammer throw was made
outside the oval in the open field.
His throw will not only establish a
new Coast record if allowed, but
surpasses the present world's inter
collegiate record of 149 feet 5
inches, held by McCracken of
Pennsylvania.
A surprise was Simonds in the
sprints, who beat Dickson in both
the hundred and the two-twenty
yard dashes.
The result ot the contest between
the underclassmen was 05 to 47 in
favor of the sophomores.
