# Baseball Tomorrow.
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
the game between the Varsity and
the San .Jose professional team de
ferred by the rains will be played
off.
The San Jose team is probably
stronger than any the Varsity has
met this year, and from the show
ing we make against them some
idea may be obtained of our prob
able chances against the Univer
sity of California team.
The nine has been practicing
faithfully through vacation, play
ing various prep, and local teams,
and tomorrow a big crowd will be
on the bleachers to show them that
their efforts to put a strong team
into the field are appreciated.
The opportunity for an old time
baseball rally such as used to take
place on the bleachers on such oc
casions will be improved tomorrow,
and for the first time this semester
we will probably hear the yell
given with the eager enthusiasm
aroused by close competition. The
game, whichever way the score
stands, is sure to be close and hard
fought. The Varsity has good
chances of winning despite the
strength of Coach Borcher's aggre
gation.
Admission to the game will be
twenty-five cents.
