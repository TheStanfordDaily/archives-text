# Sheehan's Views.

Coach JSheehan was asked today
to give his opinion of our chances
of winning the hasehalll series and
of the condition of tlie team under
his charge. lie said: "The team
is in a crippled condition at present,
due to the loss of Young at first
hasp. He is sick with the measles
and may not he able to play in the
first game, hut he will he in shape
for the rest of the series. Mis ab
sence breaks up the infield and ma
terially lessens the strength of the
batting of the team The infield,
w.ith Young out of the game,'is
strong however, and capable of giv
ing gilt edge support to the pitcher,
•lust now the men are in a slump
in their work with the stick, but
this is caused by the lack of prac
tice in this department of the game
during the late rainy spell and
will be remedied before the game
next Saturday. The general field
ing is fast and sure. The base

running is not what it ought to he,
hut 1 have reason to helieve that
the excitement of an intercollegiate
match will cause an improvement
in this part of the game in next
•Saturday's contest. Lanagan's
work in the box is tirst-class and
can only he improved by experi
ence.
"That we will win in the champ
ionship is certain. We have the
pitcher and players, and with good
support on the part of the student
body, nothing can stop them.
"You may say for me that never
before in my baseball experience at
Stanford have 1 seen so much spirit
and interest in the game displayed
by the members of the baseball
squad. The men are earnest and
eager workers.
"With a first class team playing
winning ball throughout the season
the utter lack of support to the
team, and absolute lack of interest
in the game, is an offense on the
part of Stanford students that 1
can not understand; it is a dis
grace that the "rooters" will have
to work hard to right.
"J hope that for the rest of the
season we shall see a good number
of "regulars" at the afternoon prac
tices, and large, enthusiastic root
ing crowds at the intercollegiate
series."
