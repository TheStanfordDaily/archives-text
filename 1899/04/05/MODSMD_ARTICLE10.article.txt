# Chemistry and Foods.
## 
### 
Professor ,S. VV. Young spoke in
the chapel last night of some of the
most important facts which chem
istry lias learned concerning foods.
Food he defined as that which
when taken into the human sys
tem acts to perpetuate human life.
In perpetuating life foods act in
two ways: to foini new tissues, and
to supply new energy to the sys
tem. Concerning the first not
much is known. The process of
the second amounts to the hunting
• if the food, the heat furnishing the
energy.
All crude foods consist partly of
non-nutritive, inefficientsu I "stances,
and partly "112 nutritive substances.
The latter are known as'"fond prin
ciples," and may lie divided into
four classes: carbohydrates, sugars,
starch, etc; fats; proteids; and min
eral substances. Foods can be fur
ther divided into animal and vege
table foods, animal foods being in
variably derived ultimately from
vegetable sources.
The lecturer then spoke of the
processes of plant lift 1 and growth
and the interdependence of plant
and animal life. What feeds an
animal one period feeds a plant the

next, so that, food is not really used
up but is merely used in alterna
tion by different classes of living
bodies.
The economy of food buying does
not lie fundamentally in getting
the biggest weight for the least
money, but in getting the most
nutriment for the least money.
There were various tables intro
duced showing the approximate
values of various common foods
and of the relative values, as food,
of equal money values invested in
various foods. Another important
factor in the economy of feeding is
the choice of foods in such a way
that the fool constituents will be
contained in them in the proper
proportions.
Theoretically, the most econom
ical way to choose a «liet would be
to inxl the cheapest sources of
carhuhydrates, of fats, of proteids
and of mineral matter, buy the
requisite quantities and combine
them; but unfortunately, if you at
tempt to feed a man in any such
way as that he will object to it.
V.tiieiv in feeding is as essential
almost as economy.
'Touching the foods of the future,
Professor Young said that Malthus'
prediction that in time a portion of
the earth's population would lie re
duced to starvation will not become
true; but on the other hand with
the improvement of agricultural
methods, the quality of food pro
ducts will be increased.
Agriculture will always be the
chief source for foods and chemistry
can never become a universal food
factory.
The rest of the lecture was de
voted to a consideration of this
question of the manufactureof arti
ficial foods. It is possible, but the
economy of it is extremely doubtful.
