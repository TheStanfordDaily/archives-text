At eight o'clock tomorrow morn
ing tickets will he placed on pale
for the lecture of Dr. James Watson
on Saturday. At that time those
who wish to hear the genial Scotch
man over whose stories thousands
have been moved to laughter and

by being on hand early. The seating
capacity of even the largest hall in
Palo Alto is limited, and as this is
the only lecture which Dr. Watson
gives in the vicinity, there is little
doubt that that capacity will be
taxed to its utmost.
