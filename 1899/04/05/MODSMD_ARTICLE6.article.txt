# Encina Club Jinks.
## 
### 
Next Friday night the members
of the Encina Club of Encina Hall
will give their second annual jinks
to the men of the University. The
event promises to be a gala affair
and as much of a success as their
recent reception to the young ladies
of the college. The jinks falling
on the night before the first inter
collegiate baseball game, it is the
desire of the men of the Hall to
have the affair partake somewhat
of the nature of a, baseball rally,
therefore they wish all the men ol
the University to he present. The
yell leaders will he in attendance
and will have some instructions to
give to those who are going to the
game on Saturday.
The committee has arranged a
program which will be composed of
numbers from the (Jlee and Mando
lin Cluhs, two three round boxing
matches, a wrestling bout, individ
ual "'stunts'' by those who can do
them, and a stag dance. Every
man in the University is invited.
