# LAN MAC LAREN.
## The 						Author of "The Annals of Drumtochty” to Read From It in Palo Alto. 
### 
Dr. John Watson, "lan Mac-
Laren," the noted author and
divine, will lecture in Palo Alto
next Saturday afternoon. It.was
only with some difficulty that he
was secured for l'alo Alto at all, as
his time is completely taken bv his
lectures, and he has to refuse many
invitations.
The largest hall in I'al > Alto, the
Methodist church, has la-en chosen,
and it is already evident that this
will be crowded at 2 o'clock when
the lecture begins. Dr. Watson i>

easily the most noted platform
speaker now in America. Invari
ably every audience hall where lit*
gives his famous lectures is taxed to
the utmost capacity.
Dr. Watson gave the managers
of the present undertaking their
choice of subjects, and they chose
what is undoubtedly his strongest
and most interesting, ''Headings
from the Annals of Drumtochty,
with notes."
In his readings he stops contin
ually to explain by verbal note
what he had meant to show.
Concerning this lecture the New
York Times says: ''The readings
gave a new meaning almost to
some of the passages, and showed
a« much art in the recital as in the
writing of the story."
Tickets go on sale at t he Bookstore
and in I'alo Alto at 8 o'clock to
morrow morning.
