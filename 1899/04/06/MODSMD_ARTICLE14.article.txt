Palo Alto have already pointed
out that the Stanford athletes have
not received earnest support from
the student hody. Last year there
was a slump in track attendance;

this year the diamond also has
been drawn into that fatal leth
argy. This must stop, or in the
course of the field-day, baseball
must inevitably follow. In some
strange way the opinion is preva
lent anions; the students that the
baseball team will easily win this
series of games. This is caused
partly from an unchallenged faith
in the players, but principally by
that blind, "can't fail'' hope, which
finally brought the first defeat to
our gridiron. Our team is deserv
ing of every bit of confidence the
student body holds, but mere con
fidence without the loyal support
characteristic of former years is of
little if any aid whatever.
There will be thousands of Berke
ley rooters at the lirst game Satur
day; that game will be close, with
the chances against us. The idea
of an easy victoi v can not be too
quickly lost. We can win—we
may win, but with good support
and a good body of rooters our
chances will be almost doubled.
