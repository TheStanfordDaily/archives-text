# FIRST GAME OF THE SERIES.
## What Each College Thinks of Its Men â€”We Have a Strong Battery With Good Support. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon our nine
meetB the U. (J. team for the first
game of ihe championship series
for this year. The game will he
called at rJ o'clock on the Sixteenth
and Folsom streets grounds.
The make-up of our nine is some
what disarranged and the team
considerably weakened by the ab
sence of Young from first, but
despite this fact, with such playing
as the men put up yesterday and
good support from a good sized
Stanford crowd at the game tomor
row, the chances are slightly in our
favor from ail appearances.
We give a summary of the
strength of our men and also an
estimate of the U. C. players taken
from the Daily (Uilijoruiau.
Lougheed, captain for the second
successive year, [days his position
of shortstop with all the quickness
and sureness that three years in
that place on the Varsity would be
supposed to bring about.
Of Lanagan, Borchers snys that
there isn't a team on the Coast that
can bat him. He pitches in pro
fessional form. He has speed,
curves, and not'ceably more than
last year, coolness in the box.
Swindells shows remarkable im
provement over last year, lie is
quicker on bis feet and his arm is
strongei in getting the ball down to
second.
Carson will probably (day first
base in Young's place, and his play
ing yesterday shows that he is the
best man for the position outside of
Young. His batting average is high
and he is able to enter into the
team work which has developed
between the infield men.
Strohn, at second, is one of the
best players in the team, lie is
good in every department.
Edwards, captain of the '01
team, will play third. The com
petition between him and Wright
was sharp. Wright is a good
player and will, undoubtedly, in
time be a very strong player, and
may yet make the team (his year.
His batting average is higher than
Edwards', but in a crisis Edwards
is steadier.
The outfield is very strong, better
than Stanford has bad for several
years.
Murphy sit center is one of the
best all-round players on the team.
Crandall at left has only re
cently been thought of as a Varsity
man, but in the last few days bis
batting has improved wonderfully,
so that he can be relied upon with
confidence now whenever a hit is
needed.
Chandler at right is a quick
fielder and good at the bat.
The team is very strong in field
ing, its batting, except for a tend
ency to go by streaks, is above the
average, and the base-running has
improved within the last week.
The Ciilifnrviiiv says of its nine:
The team is a stronger combina
tion than last year's, but there is
still room for improvement. The
fielding is ranged in spots, the base
running is still poor, and the bat
ting only fair.
Captain McLaren is probably

the best individual player. He
is the best third baseman the
university has ever had. He
covers lots of ground, is very
fast, and tries for every ball. His
fielding is clean and his throwing
always accurate and very swift.
He gets rid of the ball quicker than
any other player. He is a good
consistent batter.
Kaarsburgis capable of pitching
first class ball, but is erratic. He
tields bis position well and is one
of the strongest batters and base
runners on the team. Behind the
bat Cheesebrough is a decided
success. His backstop work is good
but he is slow on fouls. His throw
ing to second is very strong and
accurate; at bat be is a little weak.
At first Hamlin plays a good
game, lie is strong on high balls
and a little weak on ground balls.
He appears to be afraid of the run
ner, as be steps off the base too
soon. Fuller at second covers a
good deal of ground, but lets too
many balls go through him. He
is a hard worker and fast thrower,
and above the average as a batter.
Swan is too slow for a good short
stop. He does not cover much ter
ritory and is very weak on ground
balls, but Hies he is very sure of.
He is slow on the bases.
Hunter is the best of the fielders,
as he is the fastest and the best
thrower. His batting has improved
over last year. Wolf is a sure
catcher when he reaches Hies but is
a little slow and apt to misjudge
them by running in too far. His
throwing is weak for an outfielder.
Mien is by far the best batter on
the team, seldom failing to hit the
ball. He is slow running bases and
a poor thrower. All the outfielders
have a tendency to hold the ball too
long before returning it to the in
field.
