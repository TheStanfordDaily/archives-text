Thk lirst game f<>r the intercol
legiate clni mpiojiship in liasel-all is

to be played tomorrow. We have
not supported our team, an we know,
so heartily during the season as
they deserve. On the other hand,
from the Califumian, we read that
"the baseball team has not received
the support it should from the stu
dents. The bleachers are often
empty during practice.'' We haven't
been quite so remiss as that. But
tomorow, the crucial day of the sea
son, Berkeley, owing to its proxim
ity to the city, will have a bigger
crowd at the game than we. As it is,
we must have as many rooters as
possible in the stand. We can af
ford to have the Berkeley rooters
outnumber us somewhat, but not
any more than we can help. Our
nine we feel, man f»»r man, and as
a team, is able to take the game if
it plays its best.. It will play its
best if it fee's that the college is
with it, and the only way to prove
to a team that the college is with
it is to be there, and to let them
see and hear it. It is not by any
means an impossibility for us to
lose the game tomorrow, but by go
ing at it in the right way we can
win—and we must.
