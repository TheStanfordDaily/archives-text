Yesterday Football Manager
Berry received a letter from the
graduate athletic manager at Har
vard inquiring as to whether a foot
ball game could be arranged be
tween the two universities for next
fall. October 22, at Cambridge,
was suggested for a provisional
dale. Because of the Thanksgiv
ing game it would be impracticable
for our team to make a trip East at
that time. Berkeley has a similar
communication, and it is likely
that an effort will be made to bring
Harvard to the Coast.
