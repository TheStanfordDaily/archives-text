I'he | ii't'l i 111 i tiii t y lon ru.i inent has
liet ii continuing during the week,
but as it was m round-rohin with
fourteen entries, il has not yet I»et* 11
concluded. However, the primary
object of giving the candidates for
the intercolleuiale teams systematic
practice, lias heen attained. The
finals tomorrow will he more inter
esting, both for spectators and play
ers, and will give something of an
idea of our chanc.es against the
University of California. K. G.
Sanderson, .Schneider, 'M, and

Spencer, 'o'2, have perhaps, so far,
shown the best form, and may be
depended upon to give a good ac
count of themselves tomorrow.
The entries for the finals are F.
(«. Sanderson, Schneider,'9s), Hayes,
'01, Pratt, '01, Lieb, '02, Spencer,
'02, and \Vhitinore,'o2. All of theae
have shown themselves to be hard
players and assure a foundation for
next year's team. Hardy, '02, as
champion of the University has
been given a place on the team
without entering the finals. He
will probably be played both in
singles and doubles. He plays at
the Ojai tournrment near Ventura
next week and is certain to be in
perfect form for the intercollegiate.
Those entered ai" j requested to be
at the Kncina courts promptly at
nine tomorrow morning. A large
attendance of spectators will assure
exciting matches. The new 'i) 9
balls will be furnished. The courts
were thoroughly cleaned this after
noon. Drawings for the places are
to be made on the courts ai d those
drop out who have been beaten
three games. Games are to be best
two out of three sets.
