# STANFORD LOSES.
## Berkeley Gets the First of the Inter-collegiate Baseball Series of this Year by a Score of 4 to 1. 
### 
The Varsity was defeated in the
first game of the Intercollegiate
series Saturday afternoon in San
Francisco by a score of 4 to 1.
Stanford lost the game through
costly errors which followed one
upon another with unpleasant reg
ularity. The stick work was some
what deficient. While it is true
that Kaarsburg has greatly im
proved over last year, it is equally
true that if we had batted in our
form of three weeks ago many more
runs would have resulted to our
credit.
Lanagan is the only one for Stan
ford whose playing was above the
ordinary. His work was magnifi
cent. He kept the Berkeley batters
puzzled continually and fanned out
ten of bis opponents. But three
hits were made off him during the
game. He was fully as steady as
Kaarsburg, sending four to bases on
balls and hitting two men. With
Lanagan pitching that kind of a
game, the Varsity had but little to
do to pull out a victory. The bad
grounds to some extent, but above
all the careless errors in throwing
and in handling fiies, gave Berkeley
the right of way for all of her runs.
California scored twice in the
third. Mein was safe on Chandler's
muff. Cheeseborough and Mc-
Laren could not bit the ball and
retired. Swan got his base on balls.
Hamlin was hit by pitcher, filling
the bases. Hunter sent a hot one
past Lanagan, and Mein and Swan
scored.
In the seventh Mein took first on
balls. Cheeseborough hit one in
front of the plate which Swindells
overthrew badly, Mein tallying and
Cheeseborough going to third. Mc-
Laren put one through Louglieed
and Cheeseborough crossed the
plate.
Stanford's only run was made in
the eighth inning. With two men
out, Louglieed got first on balls.
Carson drove a timely single to
center and Lougheed went to third,
scoring on Fuller's error.
