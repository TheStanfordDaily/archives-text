Today, after a long period of im
patient waiting, the basket-ball
team played a game with a univer
sity team —and were defeated. But
they —and we —had just lots of fun.
The game was well played and the
better team won. Our gi rls were filled
with determination and their play
was gritty, but not so well organized
as that of Nevada. Team-work
won. The quickness and sureness
of the visit.ots' passes was, with
Captain Tucker's long go;il that
unfortunately did not count, the
feature of the game. The game was
fast and hard, but the young women
who played were prepared for it.
It was a good game, and we wish
theie might be more.
