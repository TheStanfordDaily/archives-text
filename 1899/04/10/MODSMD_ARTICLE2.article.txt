# Game with San Jose Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The San Jose team will make its
third appearance on the diamond
tomorrow afternoon. The Varsity
has outlined a program of hard
work for this week to retrieve the
defeat of Saturday, and not a little
valuable practice will be gained
from the games with San Jose.
The game will be called at 3 o'clock.
Admission, 10 cents.
