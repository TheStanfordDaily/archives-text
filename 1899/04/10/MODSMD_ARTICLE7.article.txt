# BASKET-BALL TOO.
## Victory Is Denied Stanford at the Hands of the Visitors from Nevada. Score, 3 to 2. 
### 
The basket-ball game between:
Stanford and Nevada this afternoon
was lost to the fanner by the nar
row margin of 3 to 2. Between six
and seven hundred spectators
watched a game that was character
ized by spirit on both sides, by ex
cellent team work on the part of the
visitors, by brilliant individual
plays by members of the home team,
and by an absence of all roughness
or unfairness throughout.
The'early part of the game was
rather slow. Nevada soon showed
her ability to make long passes,
but on the other hand the visitors
were the first to make a foul, giving
Stanford a free throw which but
narrowly failed of success. Then
followed long quick passes by Ne
vada, whose forwards, after missing
the basket twice in rapid succession,
were robbed of the ball by Stanford,
who lost it promptly on a foul
which gave Nevada its first free
goal, thrown by Miss Strosnider,
and missed. When the ball was
again put into play Miss Ward pro
ceeded to fall on the ball in true foot
ball style, after which the ball was
knocked out and thrown into the
field again and again with no gain
to either side, until Stanford made
its first team play by passing, the
ball, Pitcher to Swanson to Morgan,
who failed by a little to make a
field goal. During the remainder
of the first half Stanford was pre
vented by interference from making
a goal from the field. In a scrim
mage at the Stanford goal the ball
went to Stanford on a foul, but the
free throw was without result and
time was called without either side
having scored.
When the ball was put in play
in the second half its course was
from a Nevada player to Miss Dole,
thence to Miss Tucker, who, from
her position fully thirty-five feet
from the basket, threw a field goal
straight and true. Shouts went up
from the loyal spectators, who
thought that Stanford had scored.
Hut to the hitter's great disappoint
ment it was found that the whistle
had blown time on account of in
jury to a player in another part of
the field just a moment before the
ball had left Captain Tucker's
hands. From this point on, how
ever, the game was much more
spirited. The injured player, Miss
Phelps, left the field with a per
ceptible limp, and her place at left
forward was taken by Elizabeth
Brown. '02. Amid rapid play both
teams twice made unsuccessful at
tempts to score, the Nevada center
making splendid passes toward the
Matter's goal. Again at the Stanford
goal the ball from Miss Tucker's
hand grazed the rim of the basket,
and inside of two minutes Miss
Strosnider had made the first score
of the contest —a free throw on a
Stanford foul, which counted the
opposing side one. A few moments
scrimmage and toss up, and iMiss
Linscott had raised the Nevada score
to three by a goal from the field.
Then were the voices of Berkeley
visitors raised for their opponents
of last Saturday, and then did Ne
vada, encouraged by their success,

play harder and faster than be
fore.
A foul by Stanford gave Nevada
a free throw —missed. Miss Tucker
for Stanford missed a goal from the
field by a scratch. Ball passed down
the Held and back to center. Neva
da misses; a scrimmage at Nevada's
goal results in a pass from Miss
Morgan to Miss Tucker,'"who threw
straight into the basket, making
the score 3 to 2 in Nevada's favor,
The half minute remaining was
marked by a play well blocked by
Miss Morgan for Stanford, but no
further scores were made.
For the Stanford team the best
work was done by Frances Tucker,
captain, Winifred Morgan, Yrene
Pitcher, and Elizabeth Lewis. The
long throws and sure catches of the
two latter were a feature of the
game.
For the Nevada team the best in
dividual playing was done by Miss
Frances Kerby, center; Miss Stella
Linscott, home; and Miss Winifred
Strosnider, right forward.
The game was played in two
twenty-minute halves with ten
minutes' rest between. The officials
were: Referee, Mayme Merritt; um
pire, Louise Linscott, U. C.; scorer,
Maud March; time-keeper, Mary
Gilman, Castilleja. Following is
