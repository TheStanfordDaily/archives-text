# TENNIS FINALS.
## E.A. Spencer, '02, Who Wins a Place on the Singles, Is a Promising Intercollegiate Player. 
### 
In spite of the warm weather
the finals for the selection of a
player to represent Stanford in the
intercollegiate tennis singles were
finished Saturday with the excep
tion of one game. F. G. Sanderson
and Pratt, '01, have yet to play for
alternate. Spencer, '02, showed the
best form both in endurance and
steadiness. He won four matches
with large scores in his favor, and
will undoubtedly play a strong
game in the intercollegiate. Schnei
der, 'U9, seemed to lack endurance
and defaulted the second match.
F. G. Sanderson played well and
won his matches easily until de
feated by Spencer. Pratt, '01,
seemed likely to be the alternate
had he finished, lie is a strong
player but did not show as much
practice as some of the others.
Lieb, '02, played hard and a much
better game than his scores would
seem to indicate. He was unfor
tunate in drawing lots against the
best players first. W'hitmore, '02,
played only tw<> games. Hardy,
'02, who will be the other intercol
legiate singles player, leaves tomor
row for the Ojai tournament and
will not return until next week.
From now on he will practice
steadily and promises to play the
game of his life against his brother,
Sumner Hardy. He and Schnei
der, 'yy, will probably not be con
tested as the doubles team.
The scores Saturday were:
Spencer defeated Lieb 6-0, 0-8;
Pratt 6-2, 6-3; Sanderson 6-1, 6-1;
and W'hitmore 6-0, 6-2. Pratt
defeated Lieb 6-3, 6-4; and Schnei
der 6-4, 0-6, 6-6, the last set being
defaulted. Sanderson defeated
Lieb 3-6. 6-0, 6-3; and W'hitmore
6-2, 6-0.
