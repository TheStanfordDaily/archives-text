# Christian Associations' At Home.
## 
### 
On Saturday evening, April 8,
the Christian Associations gave
one of the most successful recep
tions of the year at the pleasant
home of Dr. and Mrs. Elliott on
the campus. Ahout two hundred
people gathered in the prettily dec
orated rooms and chatted sociably,
with the occasional not unwelcome
interruption of a musical number.
Vocal solos were rendered by Dr.
Little and by Mrs. S. E. Meek
of Chicago Refreshments were
served on trie wide veranda, which
was enclosed by canvas and lighted
by Japanese lanterns. The guests
iingered late, and departed at last
voting their hosts masters in the
practice of a very delightful type
of hospitality.
Much credit is due the social
committees of the two Associa
tions, of which R. 0. Hadley and
Miss Fern Abbott are chairmen re
spectively. Sub-committees as fol
lows worked ably under their gen
eral direction: Reception, Misses
Swanson, Brown, and
14 rough ton, and Messrs. Lang
neeker and Clark; refreshments,
Messrs. Srnith and Waite, Misses
Swanson and Davis; decoration,
Miss Cora Tuber, Mrs. Jewell, Mr.
J. C l'rall, and Mr. James Hyde,
assisted by Miss Clara Taber and
Messrs. Wilson, Crumtney, Staley,
and Moriarty. The patronesses,
who also assisted in receiving, were
Mesdames l'ranner, Elliott, and
Cubberlev.
