# A 						Novel Rally.
## 
### 
A baseball rally is being planned,
the exact nature of which is known
to but a favored few. From all
that can be learned the rally will
be somewhat of the nature of hist
year's "llurning of the Hoodoo."
The committee wishes it. understood,
however, that it is not the hoodoo
that cost us Saturday's game. It
is something else. This something
has been discovered and a remedy
will be forthcoming Thursday night
on the diamond. This date was
sele 'ted so as not to conflict with
the interclass debate and in order
that nil of the team may he present.
The exact nature of the rally will
be revealed in tomorrow's Palo
Alto.
