# The 						1900 Annual.
## 
### 
Editor Irwin lias just returned
from the city, where he left the
last installment of copy for the
Quad, and brings hack enthusiastic
accounts of the work being done
upon the book. The sample which
the bookbinder shows marks a vast
improvement over former books.
Ihe cover is thoroughly modern,
and combines simplicity and rich
ness as no other Annual has done
This year's Annual has the dis
tinction of being the first white
paper book printed on the Coast.
The paper is extra thick, so much
so that the book as bound looks
like a small-sized dictionary.
The grinds are numerous and
very well done, with some new ideas
introduced. In'addition to the
grinds proper, joshes will he liber
ally distributed throughout.
The hook abounds in good liter
ature. There will he verse by Chas.
K. Field, '95, Will H. Irwin, '99.
(ieorge Herbert Yost, '99, Wallace
A. Irwin, '00, F. B. Riley, '00, L.
Mac F. Bowman,'ol; prose has been
contributed by C. B. Strohn, ; 00,
A. Haslacher, '00, J. S. Briscoe,'oo,
11. W. Hartwell, '00, L. Mac Bow
man,'ol, and Mildred Stanford,'ol.
The engraving is clear and per
fect and shows to advantage the
excellent art work this year. Extra
wide margins will he left on each
page, which the greater width of the
paper facilitates.
On account of the rainy week
which delayed the taking of pho
tographs, the l>o< k will probably
not be out till the twenty-fifth of
this month, or possibly the first of
next.
The editors wish again to remind
the class of their obligation to pay
class assessments —assessments as
they have come in so far are nearly
a hundred dollars less than those
of last year. Unless the class is
more prompt in payment the book
whit h is a very expensive one —
will go in debt.
