Mr. Tad<l, a weli known Eastern
educator, delivered an interesting
lecture yesterday evening in the
chapel on the results of manual
training. The lecture was well at
tended and proved very entertain
ing. The lecturer Called .Borne stu
dents to the platform and gave a
practical illustration of the method
of teaching manual training. Ed
ucators are striving to perlect
bilateral co-ordination of the nerves
and to establish pel feet union be
tween brain and hand. Manual
training with ambidexterity as one
of the ends in view will accomplish
this object. The lecturer discoursed
further on the relation between
thinking an object and drawing it.
The aim should be first facility,
and then accuracy. In the exhibi
tion of lantern slides, with which
the lecture closed, were shown
pictures of the various training
schools, of the students, a nd of their
work. The slides were taken at in
tervals of a week and t lie series was
interesting as illustrating the im
provement of the pupils each week.
