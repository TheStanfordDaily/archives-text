special music was provided by Mr.
Hyde and Mrs. S. 10. Meek of Chi
cago. President Stubhs' subject
was''The Supreme I uteres! of Lite.''
In the course of his address he
said:
"The supreme interest of life is
living—right living, now and ever,
here and everywhere, lint right
living is no chance product of life.
Plain practical everyday conduct is
not a common thing of cureless
growth The personal question of
how to nil ize one's self, llioinjh an
everyday quest nut, Muds its roots
and its fruit in a spiritual soil and
spiritual air. Life with a purpose
is spiritual Life t hat drifts is ma
terial. The significant elements of
the world of nature and man are
spiritual, for both are alike inter
preted and measured and glorified
by the human spirit. The supreme
achievement in living, therefore, is
character. Goodness is character
and conduct."
Speaking of evil, the speaker

said: "It is in the world. We can
frame no philosophy that could
shut evil, the antithesis of good,
out of the world. Wherever men
come together to live and work, sin
comes also, for sin is in the man,
not in the conditions of things
about him. Does evil abound ?
Alas, it seems at times to be every
where and in everything, holding
the good in thralldom. It is aston
ishing to find how modern are the
Hebrew prophets, especially the
prophet-statesman Isaiah. The evils
which he denounced and which sent
Israel into exile are natural evils
at the present day. Good and evil
are ever modern and present. Hut
the assurance of Christ's prayer for
his disciples is deliverance from the
powei of sin."
