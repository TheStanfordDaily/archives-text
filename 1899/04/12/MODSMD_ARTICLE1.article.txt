# MRS. ANDERSON'S RECITAL.
## An Instructive Discourse on Voice Culture Delightfully Illustrated by Numerous Readings. 
### 
Mrs. .Jessie Calhoun Anderson
gave to the students a very pleas
ant evening through her short talk
on vocal training and the readings
on which followed. Mrs. Anderson
is so well known and so thoroughly
appreciated .at Stanford that her
methods as an elocutionist are re
membered with no need for a longer
comment.
During the first part of the hour
Mrs. Anderson gave a bright talk
upon her art. She emphasized in
particular one point that the usual
trainer in physical culture over
looks: the object of gymnastic
training in physical health ; this is
aimed at through ihe drills and ap
paratus of our college gymnasiums.
The development of sound lungs
and correct breathing is recognized
to be fundamentally important, yet
the methods of training to this are
often fundamentally injurious.
Heavy chest weights, the hori
zontal movements for expan
sion are bad. In the first place
they throw the delicate adjust
ment of the voice box from a
healthy position; and besides this,
they give a development of heavy
surface muscles without a corres
ponding development of the inner
muscles. So that the real result is
a weakening of breathing power.
The correct training is from within
outwards.
Vocal training, which trains to
nasal inhalation and deep chest
tones, is a form of culture that
gives one of the most desirable
methods towards a sound physique.
To read aloud correctly, with the
details of intonation and of breath
ing correct, is a physical exercise
always possible, without apparatus
and without time wasted in travel
ing to the special halls of gymnas
iums.
The readings given were well
selected, both to give variety
of art to the audience and
to show the versatility of Mrs.
Anderson as an elocutionist.
The first selection was from Mrs.
Malaprop, full of a charming, con
stant play of humor well brought
out. Mrs. Anderson is unusually
happy in her transitions, which
are for most elocutionists a mo
ment of suspense of their art.
Mrs. Anderson gave in her sec
ond reading an interpretation of
three scenes from Llomeo and Jul
iet. In this her force was shown
best in her characterization of
Juliet, with the lightness, the girl
ish nes in the garden scene, and
later the depth of the woman in
the scene where the potion is
taken.
In the last reading, from the
play Cyrano de Hergerac, the
pleasure of the quick humor of the
first passages was heightened along
toward the last, where, along with
the words, Mrs. Anderson gave the
pantomime of fencing. It was an
exquisite object lesson in the grace
of motion and the all-over alert
ness that is gained through the
practice. The foils have for some
reason never been given any prom
inence in Stanford athletic train
ing, but such pictures as these of

last night leave a feeling of regret
that fencing is not practiced here*.
