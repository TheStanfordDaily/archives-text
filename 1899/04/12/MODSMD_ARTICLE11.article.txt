On Saturday night the Musical
Clubs will give a concert in Nortree
Hall, Palo Alto. The Clubs on
their trip in the Easter vacation
made many friends for the Univer
sity, but in doing it they accumu
lated a good-sized debt, which must
come largely out of their own
pockets, unless they can reduce it
by money taken in on concerts be
tween now and the end of the
year. The first of these concerts,
given in Redwood City, while a
success musically, did not contrib
ute any money toward the reduc
tion of this debt. The clubs nat
urally hope that the concert to be
given in their own home town may
not only be artistically satisfactory,
but financially. As inducement
for a big crowd there is not only
the desire on the part of Stanford
sympathizers to help the clubs, but
also the excellent program which
will be rendered with all the
special numbers of the tour, many
of which have not been heard here
vet, ; and beside, the very low prices
of admission, which will also in
clude the dance to be yiven after
wards.
