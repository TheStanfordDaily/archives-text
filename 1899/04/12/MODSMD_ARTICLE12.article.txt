Tomorrow evening a number of
"stunts" will be did to propitiate
that fickle lady, Dame Fortune.
To the superstitious the efficacy of
a public ceremonial at the shrine
of this demi-god is imperative.
The "Burning of the Hoodoo" last
year was such a rite and had the
desired effect â€”the baseball cham
pionship came home to Stanford.
This year's performance will be the
grinding of the old historic Stan
ford axe. We have no reason to
doubt that with that weapon in
condition again the team will win
next Saturday's game and pull out
the championship at the next
meeting in two weeks.
But seriously, it is at "doings" of
this nature that interest in athletic
affairs is kept up. The men on
teams attend a rally, and the fact

that they are defending the Card
inal comes home to them with
vital force; they more than ever
realize that to win is the only stim
ulus for efforts. Winning scores
are bright spots in Stanford
athletic history, while losing scores
are things that cause sorrow even
to alumnus days.
Tomorrow is a convenient time
for all to he present, and everybody
should he there to show the team
that the college is behind them,
and to make the occasion a suc
cess.
