# Chorus for Commencement.
## 
### 
The proposition to form a chorus
to furnish music for Commence
ment Day is meeting with wide
favor. It seems necessary only to
state a few facts to ensure the suc
cess of the plan. It is practically
certain that the Commencement
exercises will be held in the new
Assembly Hall, and there should
be music adequate to the occasion.
Mr. J. J. Morris of Palo Alto has
kindly consented to act as director.
Mr. Morris is not only a leader of
ability and experience, having
organized and conducted large
choruses in San Francisco for
many years, but he is well known
as a leader of great enthusiasm—
an enthusiasm which rises rapidly
in proportion gto the response on
the part of the singers, lie makes
but one condition —that there be a
strong chorus, lie wants a hun
dred voices. Under the circum
stances there should be no difficulty
in securing tlieni, for there is a
definite object in view without
long-continued practice, the occa
sion will be inspiring, and the
pleasure and profit of taking part
will far more than repay the little
trouble.
There will be afternoon rehear
sals in the chapel at 4:80 —once a
week for the present. Later there
may be one or two evening rehear
sals. The musical clubs of the
University have signified their wil
lingness to assist, as have also
many of our best singers, and a
strong nucleus is assured. Hut it
is impossible for those in charge of
the arrangements to see at once
even all of the best known singers,
and it is hoped that no one will
wait for a personal invitation but
that all memliers of the University
glee clubs, of the former Oratorio
Society, of the church choirs here
and in the neighboring towns —in
short, all who are interested in
music and in the University, will
join and contribute to the pleasure
of our Commencement exercises.
Come out to the first meeting, in
the chapel, Friday afternoon, 4:80.
