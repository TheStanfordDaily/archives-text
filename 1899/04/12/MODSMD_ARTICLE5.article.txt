# AN AXE TO GRIND.
## The 						Cause of Our Defeat Has Been Fixed Upon and Tomorrow Night It Will Be Removed. 
### 
At last the secret is out! The
j committee has finally reached a
J partial program of tomorrow
| night's rally.
During the week I}ill y McLeod,
I with the aid of a fractious horse,
has been gathering all the cast off
I barrels on the campus for a gigantic
j bonfire. From the library build
ling to the golf links, Billy has
taken up every bit of combustable
material and rumor has it that he
has even gone to Mayfield—to get
| kegs.
The bonfire ha ving been provided
i for, the overworked committee
looked to see what had caused all
the trouble 'last Saturday. The
hoodoo of last year having been
summarily dealt with, it was not
that which had done the damage.
After much effort it was finally
found that the axe—the axe that
Stanford has so often given to
Berkeley—was dulled through too
much usage. In addition two
large nicks were found in the edge
of the illustrious blade—one caused
by 28 to 0, and the other by 20 to
0. It is supposed that the axe got
dull last fall and because of its
not having been sharpened a
Thanksgiving disaster overtook the
Cardinal.
It is proposed to have the weapon
in shape to hew out a victory on
next Saturday. The ceremony will
be publicly performed in the cen
ter field territory of the baseball
diamond tomorrow night at S
o'clock. A Berkeley sympathizer
has been discovered as well as a
grindstone After the axe has been
put in contact with the latter it will
lie tried on the former, after which,
with the proper speech, it will be
j turned over to Captain Lougheed
for use during Saturday's game.
Buzzy's band, led by Fisher
(Creenebaum drum soloist), will be
in attendance. All to take place
I tomorrow evening at eight in the
I center field.
