# FIRST LECTURE ON MEXICO.
## President Jordan Talks on the External Features of the Southern Republic. 
### 
Dr. Jordan gave his first lecture
on Mexico in the chapel hint eve
ning for the benefit of the Training-
House fund, delighting those who
heard him with a thoroughly inter
esting discussion of some of llie
problems of Mexico, and by show
ing about forty of his lantern slides.
The audience was not large, but a
neat sum was netted for the fund.
Dr. Jordan announced that as
the audience was small, he h;id
kindly consented to introduce him
self in order to save expense to the
management. He also announced
that, to save further expense, he
would give his talk on "1 he Social
and Political Features of Mexico"
in the chapel next week as a regu
lar free Tuesday evening lecture,
instead of giving it as a benefit for
the athletic project.
Beginning the lecture, the speaker
said: "There is perhaps no country
m the world more fascinating than
is Mexico. This is due in part to
thebe things: You have in Mexico
three civilizations superimposed
upon one another First, you have
the Aztec civilization. Over that i.-
the Spanish civilization,dating from
1501. Then besides the Spanish
civilization there is a touch of Amer
icanism. The Mexicans have no
corporations of their own. Their
large enterprises of every sort are
carried on by money borrowed from
England and America This fact
tends to make Mexico a republic.' -
Speaking of the history of Mexico,
Dr. Jordan told of the coming of
Cortez in 1521. The destruction by
him of the Aztec churches and
institutions, and his crushing of the
Aztec government was commented
upon. The conditions of the people
were recounted, showing that the
people there are almost slaves, in
directly, if not directly.
It was shown that at first in Mex
ico there was a period of monks.
Following that came a period ol
empire. Afterwards came anarchy,
which was so evil in its effects that
those who visited the country dur
ing its existence said, without ex
ception, that there was no possibil
ity of making a nation out of it.
This called fourth from the speaker
the expression of the opinion that
when ;i country is once independent,
it will work its own salvation.
Other people help, he thought, but
a count ry must work itself out from
the inside as Mexico has.
The coming of Maximilian wis
discussed, and also those who fol
lowed, and speaking of President
Dias: ''He rose up in rebellion hut
finally became president. lie is
the ideal of the people, and is abso
lutely worshipped. If he visits a
town the people immediately want
to name it after him. He is an .11-
round remarkable man, and per
haps today no man coulJ be com
pared with him in regard to his
governmental and political rela
tions.''
Speaking of Mexico's dealings
with foreign capital, the system of
railroads was discussed. They have
been so encouraged that it is now
possible to concentrate a large body
of troops in any part of the country

at very short notice. "Mexico is j
held in position by the army" con
tinued the speaker, "it exists be
cause it is under the control of an
army despotism.'-
It was shown how Mexico is a
benevolent despotism. The govern
ment does not grind upon the peo
ple and increase opposition to them
because they realize they are doing
it and that they give their consent.
This brought out the opinion from
Dr. Jordan that there is a very
great point in this fact. ''This sort
of benevolent despotism is the only
way that good order has been main
tained in a tropical country," he
said; "in the.se countries where the
people are most homogeneous, will
they work themselves out the best."
Before turning to the pictures,
Dr. Jordan said we have two les
sons to learn from Mexico: First
is courtesy, which all people have
without exception —''that kind of
manners that is poetry." The sec
ond lesson is that of attention to
public affairs. The opinion was
advanced that the attention Presi
dent Diaz gives to his business is
far more than any President of the
United States ever devoted to his
work.
