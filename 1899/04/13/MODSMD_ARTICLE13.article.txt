I n K baseball team lias sixain
finished its heavy practice work
and will lie (liiilin hut win Is

from now until the next llerkeley-
Stanford in*-. The team has all
•hut recovered from the heavy
slump of the past week, and there
is little doubt hut that a good
game will result Saturday. The
increase in the hatting is the
especially noticeable feature of these
last efforts. If in Saturday's game
the men can hat in the form they
have lately shown, and field as they
did two weeks ago, their chances
are of the best.
Once more there should be a call
j for rooters. The force o,f a good
I bodv of rooters has been shown
I time and again. Two days ago a
1 strong body of men on our own
I bleachers roused a sluggish game
I into something like good ball, and
I . .
raised the score three runs in the
! last f< w innings. 1 n yesterday's
: game, some systematic rooting car
' • i
j ried on 1• v a few determined men,
held the score even up to the
ninth inning and permitted but
two runs after that. The material
for a good game of ball is, undoubt
edly, still in our nine men, and if
i the student sympathizers will but
[go onto ihe bleachers, Saturday,
i and give those nine men the sup
port they need, the chances for the
series are still in our favor. The
cost is very small and every
student owes this much to his
college.
