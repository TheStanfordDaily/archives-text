# LAST NIGHT'S BASEBALL.
## The 						Team is Batting Well and has Fairly Recovered from its Slump in the Field. 
### 
San Jose won the last practice
game yesterday by a score of 7 to 5.
Both teams played a game most
plentifully sprinkled with errors,
but the closeness of the score, and
the batting eliminated many of the
grosser points of the work.
The rooting began with the first
ball, and with the rooting began
some of the best stick work of the
year. Swindells led the batting
with two hits out of three times at
the bat, and Chandler followed with
two out of four. The work in the
points, however, was not speedy on
either side, Borchers, Andrews,
and Lanagan all dropping them on
the plate with little force, and this
may account for much of the heavy
work done. Yet the Varsity has
picked up wonderfully on batting
and gives promise of making a
much larger percentage in the next
Intercollegiate game.
The fielding is still ragged,
though somewhat improved over
last week's work.
There will be no more practices
before the second game, except a
little work at the bat.
The score is as follows:
