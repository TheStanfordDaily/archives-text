Stansbury, '95, \V. 11. White, '01,
and R. K. Aleott, '91), of Co. K. of
the First California who arrived
last week from Manila, were on
the campus today. When they
left the Philippines, the enlisted
men were not anxious to return
home, because of the prospects of
insurgent conflicts. All the Stan
ford boys are well and in the
numerous fights which they have
participated in, only one, Wrigly,
was injured. A bullet scratched
bis hand, but so slightly as to
leave no noticeable mark. By this
time the men have become accli
mated, so that life there has lost
some of its terrors.
The football men have kept alive
their spirit by playing the game
with an English team. Switzer
has a position in the postoflice.
White and Aleott have brought
with them about two hundred
Sparfish books for the University
instead of the curios which they
were at first reported to have
