# LAST NIGHT'S RALLY.
## The
						Axe was Shapened and Proved Satisfactory by Testing on the Proper Material. 
### 
Last year Stanford lost the first
game of the baseball series and
then just in the nick of time dis
covered and destroyed in a huge
bonfire the hoodoo that had wrought
the disaster, and the second and
third games were won. This year
the first game has already gone to
U. (J., but last night the light of a
bigger bonfire than ever blazed on
the campus before, the old Stanford
axe was ground, and after the edge
had been reduced to the keenness
which it formerly possessed and had
been shown to be in proper shape
by a trial upon the only represent
ative of Berkeley to be found upon
the campus, there was a more en
thusiastic war dance around the
blazing heap than was that of last
year.
For a week or more "liilly"
MeLeod has been gathering barrel.*
and boxes and lumber at the side
of the diamond and all of yesterday
afternoon he was busy constructing
in the centertiehl an enormous and
architecturally elaborate prve cap
ped by a barrel of tar. Today there
is only a heap of ashes and band
iron in the center-field and ''Billy"
is a physical wreck, but last night's
enthusiasm was unbounded and the
axe is sharp again.
A little after eight a big crowd
had assembled on the diamond,
the bleachers were full, and the
team were present in their
The tire was lighted and the heap
was immediately a roaring mass
of Haines. As the tirst Haines shot
up there was a yell and with the
Stanford slogan the rally was in
full swing.
â€¢J. F. English, '01, read a legal
and literary recital of the causes of
the dullness of the axe and it was
unanimously decided to sharpen
the instrument. This was done
forthwith At about this time the
presence of a 1. (J sympathizer was
discovered. As the axe is to be
used on U. C. material the finding
of this specimen was very oppor
tune and it was immediately de
cided to try the renewed edge of
the axe on the sample in hand.
After some slight struggles the vic
tim was bound down and the axe
poised above him. With one blow
the head was severed from the
body, and was seized by "Billy,"
and with exulting capers and ec
static shrieks of ''hoot, mon"
hurled into the lire. A moment
later the body followed. The
flames closed over it and there was
no sign left. It was demonstrated
beyond a doubt that the edge of
the axe is in perfect shape; the
only question is whether it can be
wielded fast enough.
The speeches of Captain Long
heed, Coach Sheehan, and others
which followed, indicated that in
their opinion this question will be
answered affirmatively tomorrow so
far as baseball is concerned.
After the speeches the bus con
taining t he tea m was d i i ven arou lid
the bonfire at a gallop. Then the
horses were taken out and enthus
iastic Stanford men took their
places and with Huzzy's drum corps
circled the diamond again and again

with continuous yells, especially
noticeable among which was the
old ''give 'em-the-axe." Then came
the wild dance of the fellows Imnd
in hand and the songs in which the
girls on the bleachers joined. Long
before the tire had burned out the
crowd dispersed, feeling confident
that if there is anything effective in
the contagion of enthusiasm the
history of last year's baseball series
will be repeated this year.
