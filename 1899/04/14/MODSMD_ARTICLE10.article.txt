Nkxt Tuesday tlie Sophomores
will choose an editor-in-chief and
n business manager for the l ( .)Ol
(luad. Ai the meeting last Tues
day tin* class voted an assessment
of tifty cents upon its members, the
proceeds of which are intended ti>
remove the debt of over seventy
dollars contracted by the Cotillion.
The treasurer reports that he has
since met with several flat refusals
to meet this obligation, and that
there is a general tendency to
dodge it. The indebtedness was
contracted by authorized officers
in carrying out the plan of the
class. This is no time to shirk re
sponsibility and plead extrava
gance. The debt exists, and each
member owes his share. If it is
not speedily lifted, it will go over
until next semester. This would
impair the class credit, swell the
assessments for next year, and
handicap the publication of the
A nnua I.
