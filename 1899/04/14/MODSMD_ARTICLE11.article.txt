Last night's rally brought out
tht' true .Stanford spirit, and iin
bued our team with more determi
nation and a greater desire for suc
cess than it has fell fur many
weeks. This is the force that has
for so many years held our athletes
to the front; this is the incentive
that sends our players night after
night upon the diamond and our
runners upon the oval, sometimes
alone, always with few sympathiz
ers, to grind out a victory fur their
college, that, one or two such
nights in the year, they may come
before their fellows and receive the
praise they merit.
But these times, helpful as they
are to the spirit of the team, come
far too seldom, and players are
loath to come upon the Held from
week to week with only the half
certain hope of one night of wor
ship to h: 11 o w. The rooting i;-
needed far more on the bleachers

during the evenings of regular
J practice. The men have not come
out as they should. They give the
team one taste of the Stanford
tonic and go away thinking they
have done their duty for the year.
We should win tomorrow's game.
1 If we do those bleachers should he
| filled for the next two weeksâ€”and
j not only tilled, hut that with the
energy and lung power which
Stanford so well knows.
