# READY FOR TOMORROW.
## The
						Varsity Will Practice on the San Francisco Diamond Today. 
### 
This morning the Varsity team,
with sustitutes, left the University
for San Francisco to hold the last
practice before the game on the
Sixteenth and Folsom streets
grounds, in order to become accus
tomed to the slow diamond. The
men were at a great disadvantage
last Saturday on account of the in
feriority of this field to the home
grounds, upon which they had done
all their practice work.
The team will be strengthened
tomorrow by the return of Young
to the first bag. lie will not only
greatly improve the work of the
infield but will raise the batting
average of the team. Since his
sickness, Young has been able to
take but light practice work and
will go into the game at a disad
vantage. He has been taking steady
wÂ»rk at the bat, however, and can
be depended upon for some good hits.
The only changes are in the field.
Carson will take Crandall's place
at left, and Crandall will go to
right. The substitutes are Chand
ler, Wright, and Sherer.
The team at present shows some
signs of stalcness, especially among
the infielders, but the light work of
yesterday and today will serve to
bring them into shape.
A large crowd is expected to at
tend the game from the Univerity,
and, if the enthusiasm of last night
continues, a lively game is promised
To reach the grounds, take the
Third street car to Folsom and
transfer out Folsom to Sixteenth;
or the Valencia street car out to
Sixteenth and thence to Folsom.
