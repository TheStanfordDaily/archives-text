At ;i meeting of the Women's
Athletic Association yesterday
afternoon several important chan
ges in the management of the asso
ciation were decided upon and will
go into effect if concurred in by
the Executive Committee. The
leading feature of the change is the
replacing of the present, treasurer
of the association by a general ath
letic manager to he elected at the
regular student hody election in
May. This will bring women's
athletics into the same relation to
the student body as that held by
other interests, such as the musical
clubs, debating, etc. Upon enter
ing into this direct relation with
the student body treasurer the
present dues will he done away
with, but as no women will be con
sidered eligible to membership in
the associa I ion who have not paid
their student body lees, it is not
probable that the general treasury
will suffer by the change.
Other miner alterations in the
constitution are as follows: The
annual election shall be held in
May. Nominations shall be made

by a committee appointed by tbe
Board, through which members
may make nominations if they
wish. The freshman member of
the Board shall be elected by the
Board in September. The basket
ball manager shall be chairman of
the basket-ball committee, and
shall be elected by the Board.
Chairmen of standing committees
shall have a seat and voice in the
Board, and shall report in person
at the regular monthly Board
meetings. The representation of
specials shall be done away with.
The constitution shall be subject to
amendment by two-thirds of tbe
members present at any meeting.
One-fourth of the membership shall
constitute a quorum.
