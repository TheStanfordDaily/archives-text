# NEW UNIVERSITY REGISTER.
## The
						Annual Publication Shows Many Changes and Interesting Statistics. 
### 
The University Register for 1898-
99 has just been issued from the
University l'ress, and will be ready
for distribution in a few days
at the office of the Registrar.
In arrangement and general ap
pearance it corresponds very close
ly to the Registers of previous
years, with some minor changes.
In the faculty list Professor
Branner's name appears next in
order to the President with his
new title of vice president; and
under the head of Standing Commit
tees, he is made ex-officio Chairman
of the Committee on Ways and
Means. In the list of associate
professors appears for the first time
the name of Mr. Babine, the new
Associate Librarian; and Professors
Cubberley and Spencer are ad
vanced from the rank of assistant
professor to that of associate pro
fessor. Professors Copeland and
Newsom have been added to the
list of assistant professors, and
Professor Whittier has been
advance! from the rank of instruc
tor to that of assistant professor.
The new instructors are Miss Maud
March, Jefferson Elmore, J. 11.
Howard, Robert 10. Swain, George
L. Lincoln, Jackson E. Reynolds,
the latter of the Class of 189(5, and
beginning bis work in September
next. 1 he assistants have been
rearranged; those giving instruc
tion coming first, followed by
laboratory assistants, and then the
gymnasium assistants, library
assistants, etc., arranged in groups.
The list of non-resident lecturers
for the year includes Professor
Hunt, of the University of the
Pacific, Judge Lindley, of San
Francisco, and Rabbi Voorsanger,
of San Francisco.
Under the head of "Buildings"
there appears for the first lime a
description of the new Assembly
Hall, the University Inn, and the
addition to the Museum. The
Library shows a moderate growth
for the year. It now numbers
42,000 volumes and 18,000 pamph
lets.
The most important change noted
in the new Reg inter, and one which
will be of most interest to piepar
atorv students, is that regarding
requirements for entrance. Begin
ning September, 1900, thirteen cred
its will be requited for admission in
ful I standing instead of twelri as at
present. And beginning vviiii Sep
tember, 1901, lifteen credits will be
required for admission in full .-land
ing. After September, 1901. the
number of credits required for ad
mission in partial standing will be
raised from ten to twelve.
No change in entrance require
ment-* has been made since Septem
ber, 1895, when the number of cred
its required was increased from
eleven to twelve. Since that time
there has been a general re
vision and stiffening of entrance
requirements in very many insti
tutions both it) the East andWest.
Thus, at Cornell University the re
qurements have been pushed up so
as to imply, according to President
Schurman, a full year of extra pre
paration in all courses. At the

V niversity of California the require
ments during this time for group I
have been raised from what corres
ponded to twelve and one-half of
our subjects to thirteen and one-half
as ours now stand (or fourteen and
one-half as ours are hereafter to
he graded; and lifteen when the
new Berkeley requirement in His
tory and Goverment of the United
States goes into effect in September,
1901). It should be noted, how
ever. that,full entrance at the State
University in a large group of sub
jects—Agriculture, Chemistry, En
gineering, etc. —still requires only
ten and one-half credits, and that
a "limited student" may enter on
six and one-half credits.
In making this change very little
stress has been laid upon the merits
of the four-year preparatory course
as compared with that of the three
year high school course now most
common in California. The change
has been rather in the interest of
intercollegiate comity, to facilitate
the transfer of students from one
insti'ution to another, and to bring
our requirements into as exact cor
respondence as possible with those
of the leading institutions of the
country. Thus, fifteen credits, the
number fixed upon for full admis
sion, represents essentially the re
quirements of Chicago, Cornell,
Johnsliopkins, VVellesley,andothers.
In increasing the number of sub
jects required from twelve to fifteen
it is not expected t hat a larger num
ber of subjects will he pursued by
students in the preparatory schools.
Indeed, by a rearrangement of
French and German, and a re
estimate of Greek; added work in
the high schools will in most cases
simply mean more advanced work
along certain lines. In French an
additional credit may be earned,
corresponding to course 2 (six
hours) in the University. The
same change is made in German,
with the possibility of earning a
fourth credit.
One effect of the new require
ments upon the high schools will
be this: Beginning with 1901 it will
be impossible for any high school
to prepare for au..iission in full
standing on a three years course,
though graduates of the three
years course, if it is well arranged,
may enter the University in partial
standing. Thus, the new orderwill
tend to hasten the change from the
three year to the four year high
school course, without actually com
pelling it.
Under "Admission on Recom
mendation" the tendency to re
quire something more than the
statement of the principal is be
coming more marked The solu
tion of the accrediting system for
institutions which do not officially
visit schools seems to be in the re
quirement that some satisfactory
evidence of the student's work
shall be presented along with his
recommendation. In English lit
erature the experiment is to be
tried of giving all applicants an
oral examination. In History the
note-book requirement common in
the East goes into effect this year.
In physiology, botany, and zool
ogy, heretofore credited only on ex
amination, recommendations will
now be received, provided they are

accompanied by satisfactory note
books. In French and German,
after 1899, exercise books in com
position must be submitted.
The requirements regarding spe
cial work during the summer, or
in absentia during the University
year, as revised, will be found on
pages 47-48.
Under courses of instruction
there is in the main only the usual
ebb and flow in the various depart
ments. The two courses offered in
Russian appear for the first time.
Instructor Parsons' work in Phil
osophy has been taken out of the
Department of Education and in
cluded as a separate title under
Psychology. The death of Profes
sor Thoburn has resulted in the
disappearance of Bionomics as a
department, the course which
President Jordan gives appearing
as a separate title under Zoology.
Entomology also ceases to be a
separate department, but appears
as a separate title under Zoology.
Mathematics for the first time is
arranged under two separate titles,
''pure" and "applied" mathemat
ics, the latter work being offered
by Professor Hoskins, whose title
from Professor of Applied Mechan
ics has been changed to Professor
of Applied Mathematics. Profes
sor Hoskins will continue the work
in Applied Mechanics for the Civii
Engineering students for the pres
ent.
In general the statistics speak for
themselves and are appended below.
It will be noted that there is a fall
ing off in numbers of 71. The
number for the present year, how
ever, is larger than for any previous
year of the University except
1897-98. There is a small decrease
in the number of graduate students
and a larger decrease in the number
of special students, the number of
undergraduates being larger than
last year. The decrease in grad
uate students is probably accidental,
the reason being, of course, that
there is little chance to develop and
strengt hen the graduate department
until the University can afford ad
ditional equipment, instructors r and
probably scholarships. The de
crease in special students is proba
bly due entirely to the severe re
quirements put into effect the
present year The age limit has
been raised from twenty to twenty
one, and the minimum requirement
is that, in lieu of ability to do ad
vanced work in some particular
line, the applicant must be at least
as well prepared to do University
work as the regular first year stu
dent. T e work of the special stu
dents now in the University com
pares in all respects favorably with
the work of undergraduates. By
reference to statistics n may be seen
that half of the special students
admitted this year were over twenty
live vears at matriculation.
