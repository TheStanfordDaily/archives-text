Friday night was "college night"
at the "Gingerbread Fete" â€”the
annual function given by the society
people of San Francisco in the
interest of the Children's Home.
The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs furnished the evening'senter
tainment, and rendered a short and
bright program, which thoroughly
pleased the fashionable audience
present. Both clubs appeared twice,
and Riley and Culver each gave
an entertaining number. The men
were the guests of the Fete man
agers while in the city.
The Palo Alto concert took place
the following night. The towns
people turned out en masse and
filled Notree Hall to the doors.
Amid such agreeable circumstances
there was given one of best per
formances of the year. Clubs and
specialists were compelled to give
many extra numbers, and both
audience and performers forgot for
an hour or so the defeat >112 the
Cardinal during the day.
The "team work" of the clubs is
wonderfully improved. The Glee
sines as one man, and the
spirit and expression given the
music is commendable. There was
great satisfaction expressed over the
finished work of ihe Mandolin Club.
Much versatility was shown in a
variety of selections, all rendered
in a way to win the house. There
was much spice given the program,
liiley sang 'Zizzv," and gave his
monologue "The Man with a Funny
Story," and a popular dramatic
character sketch "Uncle Eph"; Cul
ver told of many amusing inci
dents of the Easter tour by his
drawings in black and white Y 7 an

Kaathoven sang "Hesitate, Mr.
Nigger, Hesitate," and for an en
core, the bright "Loucinda Lou."
The receipts from the concert were
very satisfactory and a good sum
has been subtracted from the deficit.
