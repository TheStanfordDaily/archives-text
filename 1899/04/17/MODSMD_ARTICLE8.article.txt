						Stanford Alumni Paper.
## 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Alumni Association has made
arrangements whereby a paper to
be known as the Stanford Alumnus
is to be published as the official
organ of the Alumni Association.
It will appear monthly and is to
be edited by Charles E. Schwartz,
'99, who for the most of his Univer
sity course has made a specialty
of alumni news for the Daily Palo
Alto, of which paper he was
editor-in-chief during the fall of
1897.
