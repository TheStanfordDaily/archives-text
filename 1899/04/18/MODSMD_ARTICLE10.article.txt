Those who had the good fortune
to see the fourth act oi theTrinum
mus at Professor Fairclough's Sat
urday evening not only assisted at
the first event of the kind on the
Coast, but they also received a great
deal of pleasure from the play itself.
The pari that was given, including
the famous encounter between
Charmides and ilie Sycophant, is
extremely amusing, and it is not
too much to say that it was excel
lently acted. One was particularly
struck with the perfect enunciation
of the Latin words, and with the
naturalness and real feeling with
which the lines were spoken. Pro
fessor Fairclough appeared as Char
mides, 1). li. Spooner as the Syco
phant, Joseph Jarnick as Stosimus,
and James Lelioy Dixon as Cal
licles.
Though the play was in Latin,
the accessories were those oi the
Greek stage, this being due to the
fact that the Trinumtnus.likeall the
plays of Plautus and Terence, is an
adaptation of a Greek original.
The stage was set to represent a
street scene in Athens in front of
a private house, and the costumes
were such as might have been seen
in Greece in tlie third century
13. C. The music was also in keep
ing, and this was the more easily
managed as the time used t n the
ancient stage is reproduced in the

modern clarionet. For the over
lure, Mrs Pease sang beautifully,
to flute accompaniment, the Pyth
ian ode of Pimlar, while the music
that accompanied the action was
improvised by the flute player,
L. G. Muller. An account of these
details and of the plot was given
before the curtain by Instructor
Elmore.
The success of the whole per
formance, of which the University
may feel proud, was due, above all,
to Professor Fairclough, who con
ceived the idea and carried it out
with untiring zeal. It is probable
that a public performance will be
gi veil before long.
