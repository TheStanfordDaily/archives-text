# The 						Field-Day.

### 
Arrangements for the Annual
Field day between Stanford and
ilie ( Diversity of California, which
will take plaee next Saturday, art;
practically complete. On last Sat
urday the captains and managers
of the two teams met and decided
upon an order of events as fol
lows :
Track Events —100 yards dash
(trials), 120 yards hurdle (trials),
mile run, 100 yards dash (final).
120 yards hurdle (finals), 440
yards dash, 220 yards hurdle, mile
walk, 220 yards dash (trial), NNO
yards run, 220 yards dash (finals).
Field 10 vent s —Hammer throw,
high jump, shot put, broad jump,
pole vault. There will be no trial
j heats in the low hurdles, each col
[ lege entering two men. For Stan
ford, if possible. Dole will compete
in this race. If his foot prevents his
competing here Symonds and

i Strout will be entered. Dole will
tie entered also in the two high
jumps in hope that he will be able
i to compete.
Our distance men will probably
i have very close competition this
year, as there are four men in
U. C. who are counted upon to run
in 4 40 or under, which is faster
time than has been made here this
year. Not much is known of the
half mile men of either college.
Trefetheen and Squires, who is also
their strongest quarter-miler, with
(linz a close second, are Berkeley's
best. men. Smith, Williams, Strout,
and Morris will divide the two long
runs between them for Stanford.
Birtch will be the fastest man in the
quarter for us, and should make a
good showing. In two dashes,
I'rall and Stewart will run close
with an excellent chance for two
first places at least. In the hurdles
Culver, Strout, Bowman, and Sym
onds will run the high, and two
men will be selected from Dole,
Strout, and Svmond for low. In the
walk Lousley and Jones are the
two entries. There are almost no
weights men in college this semester.
Thn best are Cairns, Jones, and
1 lopper. Murphy, a freshman, and
Boyd, who won second in the field
day last year, are the best two men
at the pole vault. Both these men,
besides Bennett and Dole, are en
tered in the high jump. In the
broad jump Hopper is the princi
pal man.
The track team this year is
small and weak in several depart
ments, but the - men have trained
faithfully, and in some events at
least will surprise Berkeley." It is
hardly hoped that we will win the
Kield-dav, but the showing ought
not to be anything to be ashamed
of.
