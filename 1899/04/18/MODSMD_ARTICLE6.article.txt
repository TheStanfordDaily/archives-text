# Hearst Debating Cup.
## 
### 
A magnificent silver cup, valued
at between three and four hundred
dollars, has been offered by W. R.
Hearst, through the Examiner, as a
trophy for the Intercollegiate De
bates. The cup will be made by
Shreve, but the design, which will
be one equally appropriate to either
university, has not been decided
upon.
The cup will be awarded to the
university first winning three in
tercollegiate debates. These condi
tions are the same as those under
which LJ. C. gained her Examiner
cup last. year. It had been offered
by that paper in 1894, and in 1898
U. C. won her third victory of the
series to our two, thus gaining the
prize.
