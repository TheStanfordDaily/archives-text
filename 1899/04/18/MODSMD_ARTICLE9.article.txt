Fifty students have come forward
already in response to the call for
voices for a Commencement Chorus.
Interest is high among those who
have begun rehearsing, but greater
numbers are needed. No music
could be more appropriate to com
mencement exercises than a student
chorus, but it would seem a serious
discrepancy lor a university of a
thousand to be represented by a
chorus of but tifty. The leader, Mr.
Morris, puts seventy-live as ihe
lowest number by which the plan
can be carried out successfully.
The twenty-live voices needed ought
to be forthcoming within a week, so
that rehearsing, once well under
way, may lie uninterrupted by the
introduction of new material.
