# THE
						PEOPLE OF MEXICO.
## Dr. Jordan Draws Political and Social Lessons from the Growth of the Mexican Nation. 
### 
The audience that waited for Dr.
Jordan last night resembled one of
his Mexican cities of the ravine.
It filled all the middle space and
ran in irregular lines up the sides.
It was larger than the audience of
last Wednesday, and Dr. Jordan
was much pleased to note the rapid
growth of interest in Mexico. In
preface to the lecture be had ar
ranged for supplement, he passed
his first lecture in review, ''in the
sincere hope that the students
would feel the two worth all they
cost."
The historical part of the lecture
was covered in the report in last
Thursday's Daily Halo Alto.
The continuance dealt with mod
ern Mexico, industrially and polit
ically. Dr. Jordan made no effort
at depth of treatment, but gave the
impressions of a healthy, wide
awake, optimistic tourist, full of
his characteristic keenness of
humor. Dr. Jordan likes Mexico.
It illustrates one of his theories
of national evolution. "Nations
are like boys. They have a child
hood helpless and untrained.
Then they are ruled. It is their
age of despotism. A little later
they are youths, and act impul
sively. That is their . ge of rebel
lion. Finally they begin to know
the meaning of living. I hey no
longer act without thinking.
This is their age of democracy."
Mexico is in the beginning of
this period. She has worked out
her own problems. Rebellions have
been frequent, hut they have been
rebellious among themselves, and
in this peace, they are yet them
selves. A foreigner is not able to
save and rule a nation.
"When I met Diaz," said Dr.
Jordan, "I said to him: 'You have
made of Mexico a great nation.'
'No,' he answered, 'I have made it
the germ of a great nation.'"
Diaz has centralized Mexico. He
is nominally President, but his
methods are suited to the people he
rules, lie deposed Warreth, but
he took care that he himself should
not be deposed. lie established
telegraphic service throughout.
Mexico He induced foreign capi
tal to build railroads. His agents
in each section warned him by tele
graph of rebellion. His troops
reached the scene almost imme
diately over the railroads and
crushed opposition in its beginning.
Brigands, that twenty-five years
ago terrorized Mexico, are today
members of a sound police force.
The power of a central authority is
accepted. Interstate taxes have
been abolished; local improvements
are gained only through the central
agents.
Industrially there is going on in
Mexico '"the peaceful invasion" of
American capital and enterprise.
The best workmen are Americans;
the latest improvements are Ameri
can. The Mexican is not unfriendly,
lie counts the innovations good
things; or at least he gra nts t liem in
dulgence.
The Mexicans themselves are not
an ac'ive people. They don't need
to be. In a land where a complete

suit is bought for fifty cents, a hat
for ten cents, and where shoes are
no item at all ; where oranges are
lifty cents a thousand ; where it is
nice and warm all day, and where
the mind longs for undisturbed
thought â€”in such a land the people
rest. The chief occupation in Mex
ico is resting. The men rest and
they have trained their burros also
to a high degree of skill in this
same national occupation of rest
ing. The whole country is harmon
iously developed in this respect.
There is no jarring.
A more concrete illustration of
the Mexican as an industrial factor
is the example of one of the largest
farms there, a territory of three
thousand acres. On this farm all
I lie plowing is done with the prim
itive wooden plow. This ranch
pays good interest. The owner
claims it to pay better than with
improve 1 machinery, for the Mexi
can laborer is so inherently care
less that machinery needing care
goes to almost immediate ruin. The
Mexican is not a good workman
nor a fast workman. His wages
are about twelve cents a day, and
he is worth no more.
This carelessness extends to all
his living. The houses are care
lessly built, the streets carelessly
laid out. There is nowhere good
sanitation. Typhus and yellow
fever are accepted as inevitables.
Personally the Mexican does noth
ing more than is consistent with
his natural aptness at resting. He
never bathes. His fifty-cent suit is
never off him till it falls off. Dr.
Jordan, following out his study in
evolution, even speculated on the
lime when the suit would grow one
with the skin, so that in time fifty
cent apparel would become heredi
tary.
Yet the nation is alive to its
political duties. They choose their
leaders and their ministers with re
spect to no party, but carefully in
respect to the man and the place.
The stirring of the nation's might
is not likely to be lost. Diaz has
created the germ. The germ is
sturdy enough to force its way
through conditions to the powerful
development that is to be in Mexico
a hundred years from now Busi
ness interests tend to hold the Mex
icans steady. Diaz is forming
plans that should help to hold it
I steady. The people in themselves
will be steady. Mexico, with its
flag of red, white, and green, shall
come to mean progress and liberty
just as much as does the nation
north of it, with its red, white, and
blue. The Anglo-Saxon has not a
! corner on liberty.
