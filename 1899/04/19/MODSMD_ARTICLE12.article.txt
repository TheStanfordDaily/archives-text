Fkom the San Francisco morning
papers it is learned that Track Man
ager Franklin has received word
from here that if the axe which we
"gave them" on last Saturday and
bailed to take from them on Mon
day is displayed at the Field-day
next Saturday said Field-day will
be promptly called off. We do not
know whether they intend to dis
play the axe or not. It is our opin
ion that they will miss an oppor
tunity if they do not —and so, pos
sibly, will we. And Berkeley is not
missing so many opportunties this
year as she has in former times.
But we do know that the threat
that we will not play if they are
mean and bring the axe with them
did not emanate from ilie track
management of Stanford. We do
not know from what source it did
come, but Manager Culver and As
sistant Manager Berry realize as
fully as any managers ever did
that it is part of their business
to get the'biggest possible crowd to
the track meet whereby their receipts
are increased and consequently
their reputation as able business
men, and they are also aware that
the axe was likely to draw more
people to the Berkeley oval on next
Saturday than the mere competition
of unarmed runner against unarmed
runner. A "college scrap" with a
broad-axe figuring prominently is

an exciting affair, and the people
would he there to nee it. That is
why our management, from business
motives would he prevented from
issuing any such notice. And there
are other reasons besiJes. Our
track managers, as well as every
body else here, realize that in the
matter of the axe Berkeley "has it
on us'' and they are not making
things worse by any such ultima
tum as accredited to them by the
morning papers.
We do not know what the pres
ent possessors of the axe intend to
do with it, but their actions with re
gard to that weapon will not inter
fere with the Field-day on next
Saturday so far as we are con
cerned—unless there should be
such a protracted "college scrap"
that neither time nor contestants
are left for the Field-day—which
we regard as improbable.
