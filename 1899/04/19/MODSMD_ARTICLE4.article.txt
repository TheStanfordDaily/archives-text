# TO SOUTH AMERICA.
## A 						Geological Expedition to the Coast of Brazil, Made Possible by a Harvard Professor. 
### 
Dr. Brainier will be in charge of
an expedition of Stanford students
that will leave here about the lirst
of next month to explore the coral
and stone reefs off the coast of South
America.
The party will sail from New
York as near the middle of May as
possible, and will go directly to
Pernambuco on the northeast coast
of Brazil. The work will be upon
the coral and stone reefs of the Bra
zilian coast, extending from Ceava
nearly to llio de Janeiro. The stone
reefs will all be mapped, and their
relations to the geological history
of the South American continent
will be studied. Collections of the
corals will be made for the Museum
of Comparative Zoology of Harvard
University.
The expedition will be in charge
of Professor Brainier. The mem
bers will l»e from students from the
department of Geology: W, A.
Wright,'oo, Ed. Oilman, '01, Ray
Collins,'ol, and Bert Collins, '01,
and one postgraduate student from
the department of Zoology, Arthur
Greeley, '98.
Ralph Arnold, another student of
Geology, was invited to join the
party, but his delicate health makes
<t, impossible for him to go.
The patron of the expedition is
Professor Alexander Agassiz of Har
vard University, who will furnish
the funds for examining the coral
reefs and making the necessary col
lections, and will afterwards pubPsh
the results of the work in the Bul
letin of the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Cambridge.
The expedition will return to the
University about the middle of
September.
