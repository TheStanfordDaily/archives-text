YOSEMITE
VALLEY
THIS WONDERFUL CREATION OP
NATURE IS KOW AT ITS BEST
Just what that means, however, the ablest
writers and the most talented artists have been
unable to tell us. They have written volumes
and have painted ihe very heavens in their ef
forts to do the subject justice, but in despair
have linally exclaimed
Go and See for Yourself
Now, that's good advice. You will find
there a narrow, crooked chasm seven miles
long, with rugged battlemented walls | Q times
higher than the highest building. You will
Hud water falls leaping from vertical cliffs 16
times higher than Niagara. You will see moun
tain parks studded with every variety of forest
tiee and flowering shrub. You will see thun
dering torrents, roaring cataracts, beautiful
lakes, Inspiring skies, brilliant rainbows, a
wealth of ferns and plant beauty, and all the
birds of the air bursting their very throats in
song for the pure ecstacy of living.
THE TRIP HAS NO HARDSHIPS
You go in a luxurious sleeping-car to within
(15 miles 01 the Valley, and the remainder of the
way iu comfortable coaches over a tine turn
pike.
Hotel rates in the Valley are from 50 to
$4.U0 per day; and the charges for guides and
saddle animals vary from $1 00 for a trip on the
floor of the Valley, to $-1.00 for an all day trip up
tiie difficult trails.
The side trip to the famous
MARIPOSA BIG TREES
