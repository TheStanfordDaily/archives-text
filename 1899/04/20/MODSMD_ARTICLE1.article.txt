# AXE QUESTION DISCUSSED.
## Faculty Committees of Stanford and California Reach a Satisfactory Agreement at Berkeley. 
### 
A communication from a mem
ber of the Berkeley faculty author
ized to deal with the axe case v\as
received yesterday. It was sug
gested that in view of recent con
flicts, and the likelihood of their
recurrence, both Field-day and
the Intercollegiate Debate be de
clared off. It is the opinion of
Vice-President Brauner, however,
that it will not be necessary to re
sort to such severe methods lo [(re
vent further disturbance, and in
this belief Professor Green, chair
man of the Students' Affairs Com
mittee, was sent to Berkeley this
morning to confer .with the repre
sentative of the faculty there.
After Professor Green's return
from Berkeley this afternoon a con
ference between the members of the
faculty committee* on athletics
and students' affairs was held and
a report made to President Jordan.
The latter then, together with Pro
fessor Richardson, issued the fol
lowing statement, which was posted
on the bnlletin board:
The committee on athletics have
every assurance that our students
arc to he received at Berkeley as
guests and to he treated with every
courtesy at the Field-day next Sat
urday. Our students are urged not
to allow themselves to be drawn
into an} 1 rush or ungentlemanly
Conduct. Anything resembling a
personal encounter between the
students of the two universities
must disgrace them both and will
lead to the suspension of all inter
collegiate contests. Let no old axe
cut off our sense of dignity and
self-respect.
David S. Jordan, President,
George M. Richardson,
Chairman Athletic Committee.
