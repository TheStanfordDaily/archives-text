Since our debating team was
chosen it has been well that they
should have every opportunity for
quiet preparation. But now that
their arduous labors are over, it is
our part to express our confidence!
in them heartily, even noisily.
The rally tomorrow night furnishes
the first chance to raise a shout in
their behalf ; the night of the In
tercollegiate meet, the second. Let
us improve both. Go to the rally
even if you can't go to the debate.
And if you are going, with the
majority, to the debate, attend the
rally without fail to practice the
yells and songs with which we will
bear on to victory the team which
can yet break the sad monotony of
Berkeley successes. They can do
it, and we believe they will.
