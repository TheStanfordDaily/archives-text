### 
The next Sequoia will contain
an editorial advocating that the
paper he published hereafter every
two weeks instead of weekly as at
present. Editor Adams says that
liis experience this year has made
it stem the logical thing to do, as
it will obviate the present neces
sary haste, and give the paper
a more dignified tone. 11. \Y\
Hartwell and Wallace A. Irwin,
the candidates for the editorship
next year, are also in favor
of the change. This will give
the University a larger and
more carefully prepared literary
magazine, and one that will more
readily take its place among the
college literary publications of the
century. Its size is to be about
twice that of the present one, but

' the ssliiij»e and general makeup
will lie retained.
The student body constitution
now reads: ''The Sequoia shall be
published weekly"; so if the change
is to be made, the matter will have
to come up at the meeting
tomorrow.
