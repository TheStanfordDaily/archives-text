These men are well known here
as the choices for debaters in the

closes the debate for Stanford, is
probably the most ready and ver
satile speaker on the team, being
especially strong in spontaneity
and fluency, lie is an Economics

one of the best debaters in college.
He is a member of Euphronia.
James Ferguson, '99, is the most
logical debater on the team, and
can always be relied on to give a
subject most careful thought and
preparation. He represented Stan
ford last 3'earin the intercollegiate,
and was alternate on this year's
Carnot debate. He is a member of
Euphronia, and a History major.
His delivery is forceful and telling.

ished speaker on the team, is a
graduate of the San Jose High and
Normal Schools, where he was a
prominent debater. This is his
third debate for Stanford, as he

Carno!, the former winning the
medal Mr. Golden, the new con
testant, is a graduate of the Lowell

The Stanford men have labored
faithfully and have completed all
the necessary work. Their work
has been of a (piieter nature than
the athletes' but has nevertheless
been arduous and prolonged. Thev
can be looked upon to make a most
creditable showing.
