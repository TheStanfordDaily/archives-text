YOSEMITE
VALLEY
1 THIS WONDERFUL CREATION OF
NATURE IS hOW AT ITS BEST
Just what that means, however, the ablest
writers and the most talented artists have been
I unable to tell us. They have written volumes
and have painted ilie very heavens in their ef
forts to do the subject justice, but in despair
have tinally exclaimed
Go and See for Yourself
Now, that's good advice. You will find
there a narrow, crooked chasm seven miles
long, with rugged battlementeil walls | O times
higher than the highest building. You will
ilnd water falls leaping from vertical cliffs | 6
limes higher than Niagara. You will see moun
tain parks studded with every variety of forest
tiee and flowering shrub. You will see thun
dering torrents, roaring cataracts, beautiful
lakes, inspiring skies, brilliant rainbows, a
wealth of ferns and plant beauty, and all the
birds of the air bursting their very throats in
song for the pure ecstacy of living.
THE TRIP HAS NO HARDSHIPS
You go in a luxurious sleeping-ear to within
65 miles of the Valley, and the remainder of the
way iu comfortable coaches over a tine turn
pike.
Hotel rates in the Valley are from 50 to
$4.00 per day; and the charges for guides and
saddle animals vary from $1 00 for a trip on the
floor of the Valley, to $4.00 for an all day trip up
the difficult I rails.
The side trip to the famous
; r.IARIPOSA BIG TREES
is $2.00, and should always be included.
