Tomorrow is our lust chance to
win a victory from Berkeley this
year. We have three tries. The
tea ma in each instance are the best
we can get and worthy of our
strongest support. But none of
them can win by itself alone —or if
it can we do not want to leave it to
do so. We have at least an even
chance to win the Debate. Let us
throw our whole weight into the
balance with our team tomorrow
night. Let them feel as they come
up on the platform for the contest
for which they have been prepar
ing with unremitting study and
patience that we realize the efforts
they have made and appreciate it.
The mere presence of a body of
massed sympathizers will lend our
debaters strength. In the Field
day, though, it is different. We
have not, we feel, an even chance
for victory. We go up there into
a desperate tight, and every Stan
ford rooter should know that many
a hard fought race has been won
at the very finish because the sud
den yell of the college he was run
ning for has instilled new life into
a weary runner. Yelling is needed
at a field-day more than at any
other meet between colleges. Each
contestant hears the yell and takes
it as directed to himself personally.
In teams organized yelling is not so
important, but there should be a
big crowd of students at the courts
that our representatives may not
be left with the ;i!l too customary
feeling that they are making a
fight in which Ihe college has no
interest. Tomorrow is the last
chance —make the most of it.
