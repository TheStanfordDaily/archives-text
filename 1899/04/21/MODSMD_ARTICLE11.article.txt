In regard to the proposed change
in the matter of the publication of
the Sequoia, which failed of ratifi
cation in the student body meeting
today, it is probable that most of
those present failed to understand

tlie question. The proposition to
change it to a hi-weekly is only
half of the change. The paper is
to be improved hy the change by
making it twice as large although
appearing half as often. It now
possesses the unique, but not to be
envied position, of being the only
weekly literary paper in the col
lege world, and on this very ac
count can not rank as it should
with the undergraduate periodicals
of the country. It would be better
for the University at large, for the
editor, and for the business man
ager, to have a larger and better
appearing paper. A magazine is
more apt to appeal to readers and
advertisers than a mere pamphlet.
The present editor, who has had
a year's experience, feels that the
change is a good one, and it seems
that Stanford should not be tied
down to a second-rate publication
when she could have a first-class
one. The only reason the Sequoia
was made a weekly in the first
place was on account of its news
value. That value is rendered null
by the Daily Palo Alto. East
ern college literary publications,
those that are accepted as criteria
among undergraduate writers, are,
in the main, monthly magazines,
and only a few of them are pub
lished even as often as once in two
weeks.
