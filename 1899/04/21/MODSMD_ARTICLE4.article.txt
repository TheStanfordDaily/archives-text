# TRACK MEET PROSPECTS.
## Our Team Small, but, with the Exception of a Few Events, Evenly Developed. 
### 
The track team will leave Palo
Alto on the 9:37 train tomorrow
morning. On reaching San Fran
cisco they will go immediately to
Berkeley, where they will be the
guests of the Sigma Nu fraternity
until the time of the meet.
'The men are, with the possible
exception of Lousley, who has been
suffering from the grip, in good
condition. Smith, who has been
confined to his room with a badly
inflamed toe,is getting better rapidly
and will be able to run tomorrow.
A few of the men were stale a week
ago but they are over that difficulty
now. The last few days of rest
have also relieved the men who
were lamed from running on a hard
track.
Telegrams passed back and forth
with great frequency yesterday be
tween captains Smith and Hoff
mann. Several changes were made.
It was decided that it was imprac
ticable to rope tho turns for the
220-yard dash and it is likely that
the trial heats in that race will be
dropped, each college entering only
its two best men. On the other
hand Hoffmann telegraphed that
in the 220-yard hurdle race it would
be dificult to place four hurdles on
the track so that all of the con
testants would have a fair chance,
so that instead of running only one
heat in this race it is possible that
there will have to be trials.
No expression of the probable
outcome of the Field-day can he
obtained from Captain Smith ex
cept that he has one or two sur
prises on the team. But only the
most optimistic Stanford partisans
can figure out a victory for the Car
dinal. Berkeley supporters, ac
cording to the Californian, count on
as overwhelming a victory as that
of last year. They expe.it to take
everything in the weights and walk,
almost everything in the hurdles
and jumps, and a good share of
other scattered points. They have
more men on the team than we and
more men with good records, but
outside the weights our team aver
ages up fairly well.
As usual there have been alto
gether too few candidates, but the
men who have trained prove that
if the interest in track affairs ever
should be aroused at Stanford, we
could turn out a team strong
enough to break the unbroken line
of Berkeley's victories. In the meet
tomorrow we will win as large a
proportion of the points as thecom
parative number of candidates for
our team justifies. If we win it will
be because a smaller number of
men have been able to develop
themselves into a stronger team
than our rivals.
