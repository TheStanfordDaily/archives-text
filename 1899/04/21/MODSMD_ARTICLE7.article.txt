# The 						Golf Course.
## 
### 
The golf players in the Univer
sity will be interested to learn that
the grass on the whole course has
been cut with a lawn mower dur
ing the last three days. The greens
have recently been scraped and
rolled, thereby putting them in
as good condition as it will be pos
sible to have them in this spring.
Moist sand has been put in the
caul at the teeing-grounds, and two
men have been employed for a fort
night in poisoning the squirrels and
tilling up the holes, so that now
there is very little danger of losing
balls in squirrel holes or in tall
grass, provided one keeps on the
course. As it is practically impos
sible to keep every part of a course
in the best shape all the time, a
custom has arisen elsewhere, and
might be followed with advantage
by the golfers here, of simply not
playing any hole when it is not in
condition. At present, however,
this is not necessary here.
It is to be hoped that golfers will
make good use of the course now
that the baseball and track season
is nearly over. If sufficient inter
est is shown, a handicap tourna
ment, which has already been ar
ranged to some extent, will take
place early in May.
