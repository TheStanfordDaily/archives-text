VALLEY
THIS WONDERFUL CREATION OF
NATURE IS HOW AT ITS BEST
Just what that menus, however, the ablest
writers and the most taleuteil artists have been
unable to tell us. They have written volumes
aud have painted ilie very heavens in their ef
forts to do the subject justice, but ill despair
have finally exclaimed
Go and See for Yourself
Now, that's good advioe. You will find
there a narrow, crooked chasm seven miles
long, with rugged battlemenied walls | 0 times
higher than the highest building. You will
find water falls leaping from vertical cliffs | 6
times higher than Niagara. You will see mouu
tain parks studded with every variety of forest
tree and flowering shrub. You will see thun
dering torrents, roaring cataracts, beautiful
lakes, Inspiring skies, brilliant rainbows, a
wealth of ferns and plant beauty, and all the
birds of the air bursting their very throats in
song for the pure ecstacy of living.
