# STANFORD WINS TENNIS.
## Hardy and Schneider in Doubles, and Hardy in Singles, Bring Home a Hard-Earned Victory. 
### 
At about 9:80 Saturday morning
the annual Intercollegiate Tennis
Tournament began on the courts of
the California Tennis Club at the
corner of Scott and Bush streets.
Some (500 spectators were present,
among whom was quite a Stanford
contingent. Both teams were vig
orously supported and not a little
of the credit for our victory is to be
attributed to our rooters. The day
was perfect, though somewhat cooler
than our players have been accus
tomed to. Sumner Hardy was
counted upon by our opponents to
win the day for them as he was to
play in two of the three matches,
while we depended mainly upon his
brother, S. P. Hardy, '02. Our
confidence was not displaced. He
played with the genuine Stanford
enthusiasm and won for us two
hard fought matches. Spencer, '02,
our other singles player, had trained
conscientiously, but showed lack
of experience as a tournament
player. Schneider, '99, Hardy's
mate in the doubles, played hard
and most of the time was steady in
bis returns.
The first match was the doubles
between Schneider, '99, and Hardy,
'02, of Stanford, and Stone and
Sumner Hardy of Berkeley. Both
teams recognized that this match
would probably decide the tourna
ment and it was hard-fought from
the beginning. It was best three
out of five sets. Our team won,
6-3, 6-3, 2-6, 4-6, 6-3. The last set
brought out applause with every
play, and at some of the rallies the
whole audience rose to their feet in
cheers. At the decisive point Sum
ner Hardy lost his serve and then
bis partner, Stone, went to pieces.
Schneider braced up and Hardy
played the best tennis of the day.
With the last serve Schneider and
Hardy were raised to the shoulders
of our rooters and carried victori
ously to the dressing rooms.
The singles between Spencer, '02,
and Hunt of Berkeley had been
begun before the completion of the
doubles. Hunt played steadily
and carefully, and won by a score
of 7-5, 6-3, 7-9, 7-5. Spencer
seemed to be nervous and did not
play bis usual game. The side
lines were occupied by rooters who
did their best to rattle their favor
ite's opponent. Spencer's defeat is
probably explained by bis inexper
ience as a tournament player.
It; was not till about two o'clock
that the decisive match of the tour
nament was begun between Sam
uel Hardy of Stanford and Sumner
Hardy of Berkeley. Most of the
sp«ctators had remained, and the
two brothers were roundly cheered
as they came out together from
the dressing-room. On account
of the fatigue of the players
it had been agreed to decide
this match by best two out of three
sets.
The match was exciting from
the beginning, but Sumner soon
began t<> show signs of exhaustion.
His brother's hard drives and high
lobs kept him on the run. Never
theless he won the first set after a
hard-fought contest by a score of

7-5. The next set went to Stanford
by a score of 6—l. Sumner was
growing pale and could not get his
opponent's hard serves. Each had
won one set. Before the next,which
would he decisive, the players re
tired to the dressing room to appear
soon in new suits. Sumner seemed
somewhat refreshed hut could not
hold his own. Some of the prettiest
tennis of the day was played, both
contestants working with all their
energy After the first two games
it was quite apparent that Sam
would win, which he did by a score
of 6-2. What was left of the Stan
ford rooters broke forth in the yell
and Sam received an ovation.
We may safely be said to have
won the tournament by the good
condition of our men and the faith
ful practice which they have kept
up for the last month.
