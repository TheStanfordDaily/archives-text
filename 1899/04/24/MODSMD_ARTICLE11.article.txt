# Michener's Address.

### 
C. C. Michener gave an earnest
and vigorous talk to the Christian
Associations last night He urged
upon the students the importance
of personal helpfulness. Selfish
ness, he said, is characteristic of
student life, and is liable to develop
a one-sided nature unless com batted
by positive, sympathetic activity
among associates.
The meeting was well attended
and Miss Hurlburt and Messrs.
Fisher and Ayer furnished some ex
cellent music.
