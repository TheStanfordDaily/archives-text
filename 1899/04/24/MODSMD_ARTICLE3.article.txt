# THE 						FIELD-DAY.
## Our Team Defeated, But Not so Badly Outclassed as Had Been Expected. 
### 
The final score in the Intercol
legiate Field-day was 74 to 43
against us, a little better than had
been expected. No records were
broken but there were a number of
well run races and comparatively
few that were not closely contested.
In the mile walk Lousley, our
strongest man, was unable to com
pete and Berkeley was able to get
all three places without very much
effort. Jones, the only Stanford
man in the race, although hope
lessly outclassed, stayed with the
walk for the entire distance and
deserves great credit for bis deter
mination and pluck. Stewart won
a tierce hundred yards with a hard
finish. In the 220-yard dash the
fact that our men were unused to
the curves of the track operated
against them. In the distances
Berkeley had hoped to do better
than in former years, but their men
were not able to make the necessary
sprintafter the long tests of endur
ance. In the mile Smith and Wil
liams took turns in setting the pace
and finished within a few inches of
each other. The time of the race
was very close to the Intercollegiate
record. Gustafson, on whom Berke
ley had placed her main depen
dence, was unable to finish and
Bowel 1 took third place. The
half mile was the most spec
tacular of the track events. Moser
and Warnick of California set the
pace intended to kill off Smith and
Williams, who had already run the
mile, but were taken in their own
trap so that after many changes in
leaders three Stanford men were
able to pass them in the last
etraight-away. The quarter-mile
race was all California's way as far
as the first two places were con
cerned. For third Birtch and Bice
fought it out until Rice dropped in
a faint a few feet from the finish.
Rice has been sick all this semester
and ran a remarkable race consid
ering his condition. In the hurdles
Bakewell, the California veteran,
was a fore-known winner. Strout
was our best man. In the trial
heats of the 220-yard hurdles, which
were both run in the same time,
Strout and Symonds each got sec
ond |> 1 ace, so that as only three men
could enter the finals, only one
Stanford man could be entered.
Symonds yielded his chance to
Strout as the faster man. As
Symonds was offered the chance to
take the place in the finals which
meant the winning of a Varsity "S"
bey >nd peradventure, his yielding
to Strout and voluntarily giving up
a sweater for at least a year calls
for the greatest praise. This spirit
noticeably animated the whole team
and there was no petty personal
rivalry so often disagreeably prom
inent between members of a track
team. Strout did his part in the
finals of the race by running Bake
well hard for first place. In the
weights Cairns won an unexpected
point in the shot-put, all the others
going to U. C. Dole surprised
everybody by winning the high
jump. Hoffman won the pole vault
in beautiful form but wasunableto
take the Coast record although he

tried for it, and came very close to
clearing eleven feet. Broughton
did not equal his former distance in
the broad jump and was beaten out
for first place by Hussey of Cali
fornia, who jumped 21 feet 3 inches.
Hopper took third.

etraight-away. The quarter-mile
race was all California's way as far
as the first two places were con
cerned. For third Birtch and Bice
fought it out until Rice dropped in
a faint a few feet from the finish.
Rice has been sick all this semester
and ran a remarkable race consid
ering his condition. In the hurdles
Bakewell, the California veteran,
was a fore-known winner. Strout
was our best man. In the trial
heats of the 220-yard hurdles, which
were both run in the same time,
Strout and Symonds each got sec
ond |> 1 ace, so that as only three men
could enter the finals, only one
Stanford man could be entered.
Symonds yielded his chance to
Strout as the faster man. As
Symonds was offered the chance to
take the place in the finals which
meant the winning of a Varsity "S"
bey >nd peradventure, his yielding
to Strout and voluntarily giving up
a sweater for at least a year calls
for the greatest praise. This spirit
noticeably animated the whole team
and there was no petty personal
rivalry so often disagreeably prom
inent between members of a track
team. Strout did his part in the
finals of the race by running Bake
well hard for first place. In the
weights Cairns won an unexpected
point in the shot-put, all the others
going to U. C. Dole surprised
everybody by winning the high
jump. Hoffman won the pole vault
in beautiful form but wasunableto
take the Coast record although he

tried for it, and came very close to
clearing eleven feet. Broughton
did not equal his former distance in
the broad jump and was beaten out
for first place by Hussey of Cali
fornia, who jumped 21 feet 3 inches.
Hopper took third.

The final score in the Intercol
legiate Field-day was 74 to 43
against us, a little better than had
been expected. No records were
broken but there were a number of
well run races and comparatively
few that were not closely contested.
In the mile walk Lousley, our
strongest man, was unable to com
pete and Berkeley was able to get
all three places without very much
effort. Jones, the only Stanford
man in the race, although hope
lessly outclassed, stayed with the
walk for the entire distance and
deserves great credit for bis deter
mination and pluck. Stewart won
a tierce hundred yards with a hard
finish. In the 220-yard dash the
fact that our men were unused to
the curves of the track operated
against them. In the distances
Berkeley had hoped to do better
than in former years, but their men
were not able to make the necessary
sprintafter the long tests of endur
ance. In the mile Smith and Wil
liams took turns in setting the pace
and finished within a few inches of
each other. The time of the race
was very close to the Intercollegiate
record. Gustafson, on whom Berke
ley had placed her main depen
dence, was unable to finish and
Bowel 1 took third place. The
half mile was the most spec
tacular of the track events. Moser
and Warnick of California set the
pace intended to kill off Smith and
Williams, who had already run the
mile, but were taken in their own
trap so that after many changes in
leaders three Stanford men were
able to pass them in the last
etraight-away. The quarter-mile
race was all California's way as far
as the first two places were con
cerned. For third Birtch and Bice
fought it out until Rice dropped in
a faint a few feet from the finish.
