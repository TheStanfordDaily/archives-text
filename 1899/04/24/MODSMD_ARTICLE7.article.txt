The list of regular intercollegiate
contests between (Stanford and the
University of California for this
year has been inn through and we
have one lone victory to our credit.
It is not pleasant to reflect upon
defeats, much less to talk of them ;
yet defeats are now the principal
topic of our conversation and food
for our reflection. After all, there
is not much to be said â€”nothing
can be said that will do much good.
Something, however, must be dune.
There is no need for any radical
changes anywhere. In debate, we
had a good team, one that we are
satisfied with. Nobody is found to
say that California's debaters were
superior in any considerable degree
to ours. The system now in opera
tion here and the material both
are of such a character that
no change whatever need be ad
vocated. VVe have won debates and
can win more. What is needed for
the success of our athletic teams
beyond what we bad this year is
more candidates and greater ear
nestness. Carefully elaborated
"rallies" are artificial and although
they may 'be helpful they cannot
win victories from carefully trained
teams or teams selected from a
number of candidates exceeding
ours by a ratio of three to one. U. C.
now is a strong rival, and to de

feat her we must prepare for hard
j contests. The hard contests will
j surely come, if we omit, the pre
par tion, defeats are inevitable.
I With the right sort of preparation
: victories are just as sure.
