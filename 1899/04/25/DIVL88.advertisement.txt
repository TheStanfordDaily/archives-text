YOSEMITE
VALLEY
THIS WONDERFUL CREATION OF
NATURE IS hOW AT ITS BEST
Just what that menus, however, the ablest
writers and the most talented artists have been
unable to tell us. They have written volumes
aud have painted ihe very heavens in their ef
forts' to do the subject justice, but in despair
have liually exclaimed
Go and See for Yoorself
Now, that's good advice. You will find
there a narrow, crooked chasm seven miles
long, with rugged battlemented walls | 0 times
higher than the highest building. You will
find water falls leaping from vertical cliffs | 6
times higher than Niagara. You will see moun
tain parks studded with every variety of forest
tree and flowering shrub. You will see thun
dering torrents, roaring cataracts, beautiful
lakes, inspiring skies, brilliant rainbows, a
wealth of l'erns aud plant beauty, and all the
birds of the air bursting their very throats in
song for the pure ecstacy of living.
THE TRIP HAS NO HARDSHIPS
You go in a luxurious sleeping-car to within
6f> miles of the Valley, and the remainder of the
way in comfortable coaches over a tine turn
pike.
