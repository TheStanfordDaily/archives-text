# THE 						DEBATE.
## A 						Summary of the Arguments Advanced by the Two Teams Last Saturday. 
### 
The seventh annual Intercol
legiate Debate was lost to Berkeley
Saturday evening in Metropolitan
Hall. The decision of the judges
gave tlie IJ. C the right to hold the
Hearst cup for at least one year, it
being now offered for the first time
to the university next winning
three debates, and the Moffatt prize
of $'200, to be divided among the
California speakers. The score of
Intercollegiate Debates now stands
four to three in favor of our friends
across the bay.
Both by reason of the contest be
tween the universities and the polit
ical significance of the question for
debate, the hall was crowded early
in the evening, many persons
being refused admission by the
police, who for some mysterious
reason were present in great force,
After the exchange ot the usual
complimentary yells and '"joshes"
between the rooters from each col
lege, Prof. C. Al. (Jayley, represent
ing President Kellogg,of the Univer
sity of California, ca lied the meeting
to order and, after defining what he
thought to be the meaning of "pre
sentation'' and "argument,'' re
quested jgt he judges to decide the
question according to the showing
made by the debaters as a team,
and not according to their personal
bias, lie then read the question
for debate: "Resolved, That the re
tention of the Philippines is con
trary to the principles for which this
Government should stand,'' and
introduced John Springer, '00, of
Stanford, who lead for the affirma
tive.
Springer laid out the question in
a fair and impartial manner. "Two
points are at issue," he said, "name
ly: What are the principles for
which this Government should
stand? and. Is retention contrary to
those principles? The phrase 're
tention is contrary' confines the
method of boiling the Philippines
to the present form, which is mili
tary domination. We are not com
pelled to defend any happy form of
government that our opponents
may conjure up for the dim and
hazy future. We are attacking
'present retention.'"
Jn defining the first issue he said:
"Our Government should stand for
democratic principles as laid down
in the Declaration of Independence
because they make the he»t govern
ment, the best men; because we
ha ve always stood for them, because
by their observance we have been
guided to success."
The debate was opened for
the negative by W. M. Mar
tin, whose delivery was by far
the best of the California debaters.
He claimed that the result of
Dewey's victory was the destruction
of the only stable government in
the Philippines; sothat under inter
national law America was morally
responsible to the world for peace
and order in those islands. Since
the Filipinos were unfit for self
government our duty to civiliza
tion was to establish good govern
ment. over them. To withdraw
would be a confession that we were
too weak or too corrupt to govern,

a thing incompatible with national
honor. To face our international
responsibility, to perform our duty
to civilization, to guard the na
tional honor, these were the high
principles for which this Govern
ment should stand. Hedevotedno
time to rebuttal.
James Ferguson, '99, who fol
lowed for Stanford, replied that it
was fallacious to claim that any
certain line of policy was " duty"
and quoted Admiral Dewey and
other authorities to show that the
Filipinos were capable of self-gov
ernment. He took up the second
issue in the debate as laid down by
Mr. Springer, and showed that the
retention of the Philippines is con
trary to democratic principles be
cause (1) we have deceived and mis
led the people who placed confi
dence in us ; (2) we tire attempting
to govern without the consent of
the governed ; (3) we are waging a
war of conquest upon a free people;
(4) we will crush, not develop, the
manhood and independent spirit of
the natives; (5) we will destroy the
independent government ot the
Filipinos; and secondly, because re
tention appeals to a false and un
democratic idea of duty toward the
people of these islands, making of
this nation the self-constituted
guardian of a protesting people.
Mr. Ferguson received an ovation
at the close of his speech.
Mr. Curl M. Warner then look
up the attack for California. The
first few minutes of his speech were
devoted to rebuttal in a light and
humorous vein, including a mis
quotation of a statement by the
leader of the affirmative. His pos
itive argument was illustrated by
a diagram containing certain
"trapezoids" and "parallelograms"
intended to show that the affirma
tive must prove that every prin
ciple for which this Government
should stand would be broken by
retention, in order to win its case.
He held that we would be but car
rying out our working system of
democratic principles by retaining
the Philippines.
A. H. Suzzallo, '99, followed for
Stanford with one of the most elo
quent speeches of the evening. He
showed that retention was contrary
to demcoratic principles as applied
to our own country, and that the
violation of them would react un
favorably upon us. His voice was
strong, his presence easy, and
when he closed the Stanford root
ers felt confident of victory.
P. M. ({olden of Hasting Law Col
lege was the final negative speaker.
He summed up the case for the
negative and was also guilty of a
misquotation of Dr. Jordan. In
the last few minutes of bis speech
he produced the negative's form of
retention,which was a Protectorate.
He then accused the Stanford men
of begging the question and de
manded to know their solution of
the problem.
Springer replied in his rebuttal
speech that this was not. a question
of present retention, so it was not
incumbent upon the affirmative to
do anything but attack theexisting
order of things in the Philippines,
but we would only say "do with
the Philippines as you are doing
with Cuba," and continued by

making some very witty remarks'
about the "trapezoid."
The California team did not de
vote so much attention to rebuttal J
as our own but, without attempting
to any great extent to tear down
the Stanford propositions, built up
a case for themselves. Our men
showed careful preparation and
their presentation was easy, clear,
and forceful. The excellence of
their team work was also note
worthy.

making some very witty remarks'
about the "trapezoid."
The California team did not de
vote so much attention to rebuttal J
as our own but, without attempting
to any great extent to tear down
the Stanford propositions, built up
a case for themselves. Our men
showed careful preparation and
their presentation was easy, clear,
and forceful. The excellence of
their team work was also note
worthy.
The seventh annual Intercol
legiate Debate was lost to Berkeley
Saturday evening in Metropolitan
Hall. The decision of the judges
gave tlie IJ. C the right to hold the
Hearst cup for at least one year, it
being now offered for the first time
to the university next winning
three debates, and the Moffatt prize
of $'200, to be divided among the
California speakers. The score of
Intercollegiate Debates now stands
four to three in favor of our friends
across the bay.
Both by reason of the contest be
tween the universities and the polit
ical significance of the question for
debate, the hall was crowded early
in the evening, many persons
being refused admission by the
police, who for some mysterious
reason were present in great force,
After the exchange ot the usual
complimentary yells and '"joshes"
between the rooters from each col
lege, Prof. C. Al. (Jayley, represent
ing President Kellogg,of the Univer
sity of California, ca lied the meeting
to order and, after defining what he
thought to be the meaning of "pre
sentation'' and "argument,'' re
quested jgt he judges to decide the
question according to the showing
made by the debaters as a team,
and not according to their personal
bias, lie then read the question
for debate: "Resolved, That the re
tention of the Philippines is con
trary to the principles for which this
Government should stand,'' and
introduced John Springer, '00, of
Stanford, who lead for the affirma
tive.
Springer laid out the question in
a fair and impartial manner. "Two
points are at issue," he said, "name
ly: What are the principles for
which this Government should
stand? and. Is retention contrary to
those principles? The phrase 're
tention is contrary' confines the
method of boiling the Philippines
to the present form, which is mili
tary domination. We are not com
pelled to defend any happy form of
government that our opponents
may conjure up for the dim and
hazy future. We are attacking
'present retention.'"
Jn defining the first issue he said:
"Our Government should stand for
democratic principles as laid down
in the Declaration of Independence
because they make the he»t govern
ment, the best men; because we
ha ve always stood for them, because
by their observance we have been
guided to success."
The debate was opened for
the negative by W. M. Mar
tin, whose delivery was by far
the best of the California debaters.
He claimed that the result of
Dewey's victory was the destruction
of the only stable government in
the Philippines; sothat under inter
national law America was morally
responsible to the world for peace
and order in those islands. Since
the Filipinos were unfit for self
government our duty to civiliza
tion was to establish good govern
ment. over them. To withdraw
would be a confession that we were
too weak or too corrupt to govern,

a thing incompatible with national
honor. To face our international
responsibility, to perform our duty
to civilization, to guard the na
tional honor, these were the high
principles for which this Govern
ment should stand. Hedevotedno
time to rebuttal.
James Ferguson, '99, who fol
lowed for Stanford, replied that it
was fallacious to claim that any
certain line of policy was " duty"
and quoted Admiral Dewey and
other authorities to show that the
Filipinos were capable of self-gov
ernment. He took up the second
issue in the debate as laid down by
Mr. Springer, and showed that the
retention of the Philippines is con
trary to democratic principles be
cause (1) we have deceived and mis
led the people who placed confi
dence in us ; (2) we tire attempting
to govern without the consent of
the governed ; (3) we are waging a
war of conquest upon a free people;
(4) we will crush, not develop, the
manhood and independent spirit of
the natives; (5) we will destroy the
independent government ot the
Filipinos; and secondly, because re
tention appeals to a false and un
democratic idea of duty toward the
people of these islands, making of
this nation the self-constituted
guardian of a protesting people.
Mr. Ferguson received an ovation
at the close of his speech.
Mr. Curl M. Warner then look
up the attack for California. The
first few minutes of his speech were
devoted to rebuttal in a light and
humorous vein, including a mis
quotation of a statement by the
leader of the affirmative. His pos
itive argument was illustrated by
a diagram containing certain
"trapezoids" and "parallelograms"
intended to show that the affirma
tive must prove that every prin
ciple for which this Government
should stand would be broken by
retention, in order to win its case.
He held that we would be but car
rying out our working system of
democratic principles by retaining
the Philippines.
A. H. Suzzallo, '99, followed for
Stanford with one of the most elo
quent speeches of the evening. He
showed that retention was contrary
to demcoratic principles as applied
to our own country, and that the
violation of them would react un
favorably upon us. His voice was
strong, his presence easy, and
when he closed the Stanford root
ers felt confident of victory.
P. M. ({olden of Hasting Law Col
lege was the final negative speaker.
He summed up the case for the
negative and was also guilty of a
misquotation of Dr. Jordan. In
the last few minutes of bis speech
he produced the negative's form of
retention,which was a Protectorate.
He then accused the Stanford men
of begging the question and de
manded to know their solution of
the problem.
Springer replied in his rebuttal
speech that this was not. a question
of present retention, so it was not
incumbent upon the affirmative to
do anything but attack theexisting
order of things in the Philippines,
but we would only say "do with
the Philippines as you are doing
with Cuba," and continued by

making some very witty remarks'
about the "trapezoid."
The California team did not de
vote so much attention to rebuttal J
as our own but, without attempting
to any great extent to tear down
the Stanford propositions, built up
a case for themselves. Our men
showed careful preparation and
their presentation was easy, clear,
and forceful. The excellence of
their team work was also note
worthy.
