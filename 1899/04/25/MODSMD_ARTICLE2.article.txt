## 
### 
On Friday evening the Stanford
Alumni of San Jose gathered in the
dining room of the St. James Hotel
for their first banquet since organ
izing as a branch association about
a month ago.
There were about thirty-five per
sons present, who, after a prelimi
nary business meeting, sat down to
discuss a well-planned menu, after
which toasts were given,with Alfred
Barstow as toastmaster.
Arthur Washburn,'93, responded
to "Our Alumni Association." He
spoke of the purity of purpose and
high ideals which should control
every alumnus. "In the close
union with our alma mater is great
strength for us all.'' Dr. J. C. Hran
ner responded in a humorous vein
to the toast, "What the Alumni
can do for their alma mater." "J
think," he said, "this is expressed
in the words' Honor thy father and
thy mother.' What each one of you
is is largely the result of your
training at the University. Stan
ford is young and has much to con
tend with."
Edward M. Rea, '95, responded
to "Harvard." Dr. Jenkins fol
lowed with "The Alumnus at
Work." Professor Clarke B. Whit
tier, responding to "Influences of
the Alumni on the University,"
said: " The alumni should have a
more enthusiastic spirit than the
students. It is not expected that
the university will give spirit to the
alumni,but the alumni to the Uni
versity." Mrs. Louise Maitland
closed, speaking appreciatively of
the Stanford spirit which en
courages the woman, not indeed "to
take the place of the man, but to
share the work of the man."
After the banquet was over the
party assembled in the hotel par
lors for the rest of the evening and
all left after the affair was over
feeling satisfied that the San Jose
Alumni Association is in the way
of doing much good.
Those present al the banquet in
cluded both San Jose and Stanford
people. Mrs. Stanford had been
invited, but she was unable to be

of beautiful roses and a note of
declination in which she said:
"You have my sincere and heart
felt good wishes for the entire Stan
ford Alumni ('lass, in which 1 feel
a deep interest for future success,
which means earning for yourself
a good name and a record for hav
ing at heart the teachings of our
greatest of all teachers, 'To do unto
others as you would have others do
unto you,' which is the secret of a
Christian life."
