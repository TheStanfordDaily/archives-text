# THE
						AXE AVENGED.
## The
						Famous Senior C Fence Transplanted from California's Campus to the Stanford Quad. 
### 
In retaliation for the capture of
the axe the Senior C fence of the
University of California was taken
from the Berkeley campus at 2:30
this morning by twenty Stanford
men anil brought around the bay
today, to be received by the most
spontaneous demonstration of stu
dent enthusiasm which has oc
curred since the winning of the
Government suit.
Such an expedition had been
planned for Saturday night, but
failed through unforeseen accidents
and was abandoned. Yesterday at
noon several students quietly got
together, planned another raid,
picked twenty men, and were away
:it G p.m. The crowd divided into
three squads; one, of four men, took
a four-in-hand team around the
bay to Hay wards in order to pick
up the fence along the road; others,
each equipped with a conveyancc,
were to make the attempt separ
ately from two different points.
The men dropped quietly into
the town of Berkeley, which was
almost deserted early in the even
ing owing to the Bourdon celebra
tion, and got to the campus by two
in the morning. The first expedi
tion, led by Ray Smith and Van
Kaathoven, here did the "stunt" of
the whole performance and un
doubtedly saved the day. They
were caught and followed into
Berkeley by the night watchman,
appointed to look out for Stanford
raiders. Noticing this fact, Smith
& Co. led expedition No. 1 away
past the campus and into the hills,
the sleuth-hounds of the Berkeley
police force following all the way.
Finally squad No. 1 carried them
so far away that there was no hope
of their returning to Berkeley in
time.
Meanwhile squad No. 2, under
the leadership of Gregory and
Lawsh6, had driven to the campus
unmolested, pulled the fence apart
and loaded it in an express wagon
which Bonnemort and Havens had
procured at great trouble. It was
a wonderfully quick operation.
Lawsh6 went to work with the con
tents of a bag which looked like a
burglar's kit, Ballentine & Co. put
their muscle on a crowbar, and the
IT. C. fenee was in pieces. At 3:15
the pride of California slipped
quietly from the ken of the cam
pus where it was so uproariously
dedicated a year ago and went
mysteriously northward.
The Haywards division — Rob
erts, Erb, Irwin, and Bowman —
had waited since 1 a.m., trying to
keep warm with a horse-blanket
and a mackintosh between them,
and nervously figuring on possibil
ities. At tive o'clock there was
still no sign, and Erb was sent
ahead on a bicycle to reconnoitre.
Half an hour later he took a
header into the arms of the relief
expedition, shouting wildly as he
fell: "Hitch up! They have it!"
This was the first jollification of a
wild day.
The relief "hitched up" forth
with. and took the fence between
Haywards and Oakland, having
