YOSEMITE
VALLEY
THIS WONDERFUL CREATION OF
NATURE IS NOW AT ITS BEST
Just what that moans, however, tins ablest
writers aud the most talented artists have been
unable to toll us. They have written volumes
and have painted the very heavens in their ef
forts to do the subject justice, but in despair
have dually exclaimed
Go and See for Yourself
I
Now, that's good advice. You will Hud
there a narrow, crooked chasm seven miles
long, with rugged batt lemon tod walls 1 O times
higher than the highest building. Vou will
tlnd water falls leaping from vertical cliffs | 6
times higher than Niagara. You will see moun
tain parks studded with every variety of forest
tree and flowering shrub. You will see thun
dering torrents, roaring cataracts, beautiful
lakes, Inspiring skies, brilliant rainbows, a
wealth of ferns and plant beauty, and all the
birds of the air bursting their very throats in
song for the pure ecstacy of living.
THE TRIP HAS NO HARDSHIPS
You go in a luxurious sleeping-car to wii hiu
fir> miles of the Valley, and the remainder of the
way in comfortable coaches over a tine turn
pike.
