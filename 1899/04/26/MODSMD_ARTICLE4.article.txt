# FENCE JUBILEE.
## Speeches and General Good Time Around the California C in Encina. 
### 
Despite the heavy rain last night
a big crowd of men and women
gathered in Encina Clubrooin to
view the C fence which had been
laid out there during the afternoon.
After"the usual singing of Stan
ford songs and preliminary "jolly
ing up," the crowd assembled
around the C while some of the few
raiders who were able to be awake
after the previous sleepless night
told of incidents of Monday night's
trip standing in the open space of
the historic fence.
After the speeches there was an
open discussion as the disposition
of the fence, which, according to
the edict of the faculty, must not re
main in any of the University
buildings. Finally upon motion of
McDowell, '99, a committee of ten
was appointed to take the entire
matter in charge. This committee
consists of Milnor lloberts, '99
(chairman), McDowell, '99, Oreg
ory, '99, Rea Smith, '99, F. S. Fisher,
'99, Parker, '99, Berry,'99,Chandler,
'99, Erb, '01, and LawshÂ£, '01.
The committee retired and after
deliberation decided upon a plan of
action. Fickert, '98, was appointed
captain of the guard to cooperate
with the committee.
After this business was disposed
of the meeting resolved itself into a
pleasant social reception which
lasted for an hour or more.
