# President Jordan Defends Seals.
## 
### 
President Jordan appeared before
the U. S. Fish Commissioners in
San Francisco on Monday in de
fense of the seals whose principal
rookery is on the Farallones. The
fishermen of San Francisco and
vicinity claim that the seals cause
very great destruction among the
fishes, and on that account want
them exterminated. Dr. Jordan
claims that the seals are entitled to
a thorough investigation before be
ing killed, for he was not certain
hut that they are not the whole
cause of the evils complained of by
the fishermen.
