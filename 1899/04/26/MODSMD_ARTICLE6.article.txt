# Report of Seal Commission.
## 
### 
Copies have just been received
from Washington of Parts 1 and 2
of the report which, as commis
sioner in charge of the fur peal
investigations of 1896-97, Dr. Jor
dan has submitted to the U S.
Treasury Department. They are
volumes of about 800 pages each.
Part 1 is entitled '' The History,
Condition, and Needs of the Herd
of Fur Seals Resorting to the Prib
iluf Islands and is compiled by
Dr. Jordan and Oeorge A. Clark.
It contains twenty-one full page
plates from photographs and
twelve full page drawings from
nature by Hristow Adams, '00.
['art 2 is entitled "Observations
on the Fur Seals of the Pribilof
Islands." It gives facts covering
the years 1872 to 1897 "as ex
tracted from the log of St. Paul Is
land, and as recorded in the daily
journal of the Commission of 1896
and 1897."
In Part I the main phases of
the fur seal controversy are taken
up and discussed at length, such

historical matters us are necessary
for a clear understanding of the
matter being included. It thus
constitutes a report complete in
itself of the investigation so far as
the general condition, needs, and
possibilities of the Pribilof Islands
herd of fur seal are concerned.
Part 'ideals more with matters of
detail.
The finding of the commission
as expressed in Part 1 is that the
herd has declined; that no appre
ciable part of that decline is due to
illegal killing; but that pelagic
sealing necessarily involves indis
criminate killing of males and
females, and that such destruction
of females, if it reach more than
six and two-thirds per cent, must
in the end diminish the herd. The
figures for the catches show that
the greater proportion of the ani
mals taken in the pelagic catch are
females, hence the continuance of
pelagic sealing can have but one
end.
