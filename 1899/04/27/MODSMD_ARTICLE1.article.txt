# COMBINED CONCERT.
## Musical Clubs of Stanford and the University of California to Appear Together Saturday. 
### 
On Saturday evening at the Al
hambra Theatre our musical clubs
will combine with those of the
University of California in a mon
ster intercollegiate concert which
promises to be the biggest event of
its kind in several years. The en
tertainment, is well advertised in
San Francisco and Oakland by
huge bills printed in cardinal and
blue and gold, by attractive win
dow cards printed in the same col
ors with cuts of the clubs, and by
photographs of our organizations
and specialists which are placed in
the principal show windows of the
city.
The patronesses are all well
known society people of San Fran
cisco, and there is every indication
that there w II be a large and fash
ionable audience to greet the
Clubs. The program will consist
of about twelve numbers, each col
lege contributing an equal number.
Our Olee and Mandolin Clubs are
in excellent condition, and on Sat
urdav should play and sing better
than ever before. Riley and Cul
ver will contribute one number a
pieci-* to our portion of the program.
Berkeley will send her Olee, Man
dolin, and Banjo Clubs, a baritone
and a eello soloist.
Much interest has been aroused
in both universities over the enter
tainment. As this is the first time
all the clubs of each college have ap
peated in combination the concert
will naturally partake something
of the form of a competition, and
will furnish an opportunity for com
paring the merits of both organiza
tions which have appeared separ
ately for the last several seasons in
all tlie principa 1 townsof the Bacilic
Coast. Berkeley will of course
have a big following at the concert
and Stanford should try to con
tribute her share of the audience.
This will be the first intercolle
giate event since the loss of our axe
and the daring raid on tiie Berkeley
(', and there is some question as to
whether the musicians will take up
confli< t in song and story on Satur
day night. It is altogether prob
able, however, that no mention will
be made of tence or axe.
As a college show the concert
Saturday promises to be on a par
with anything of its kind to he
seen on the Coast. There will he
"sixty people on the stage" and rol
licking college songs, sweet mando
lin music, rag-time banjo pieces,
and bright specialties will follow
one another in quick succession.
This will be the lirst appearance of
our clubs in a San Francisco the
ater for two years, but they have
been heard from time to time in
gingerbread fetes and other social
functions and have made a wide
circle of friends.
