Thk clippings from the Califor
i) ia n which we publish tod a y are
interesting and instructive at least.
Jt is the opinion of the students of
the University of California as
shown by the interviews in the
Callfnrnian, and of the faculty as
was shown by the telegram re
ceived by a member of our own
faculty, thai they didn't want the
old fence, anyhow, and are sin
cerely, not to say demonstratively
grateful to those who removed the
unsightly and ridiculous affair
from the face of their fair campus.
We e;in not blame them much for
this, perhaps. Jt has always
seemed to us that the fence was an
object more likely to call for ridi
cule than veneration, but we never
realized before how heart-rending
was their anxiety to he rid of it.
According to the men who did re
move it, not very much time,
strength, or skill was required.
However, we have done several
things in regard to the fence that
Berkeley never did. We have
"joshed" it. There is a story
here of some Stanford men who
one day were innocently sitting
on the fence chatting with a IJ. C.
undergraduate. They asked him
it he Would not sit beside them
" No, it is too sacred,'" was the re
ply in awestricken tones, and the
junior remained standing. That

was pofcssil»ly before they realised
what a poor affair the encumbrance
was. It was possibly a lingering
trace of this reverence that has pre
vented them from laying violent
hands upon the useless wood as it
broiled in the sun while they stood
aside and wished it would depart
in some way that wouldn't convict
them of sacrilege. And we have
saved them. Only we would like
the credit for the deed. It seems a
little strange to us that the editor
of so enterprising a sheet as the
Calif or nian should n-'thave known
I>3' Wednesday morning that it was
men from this University who took
the fence, when the city dailies of
Monday afternoon and Tuesday
morning had articles upon the inci
dent that were calculated to attract
considerable attention. And yet
in Wednesday morning's Califor
nian the idea that Stanford men
had taken the fence seems to he
only a theory. So we can not say
whether the "more distant, more
disagreeable pi.ice" than the West
Berkeley stock-yards refers to our
own campus or not. If it does we
think it.was a real mean thing to
say. And we are moved to wonder
what would have been said if in
stead of being considered deserving
of only their common contempt"
we had been thought worthy of a
contempt of some extraordinary
brand. At any rate there seems to
be a different sort of spirit at
Berkeley than here. The fence
ma}' have been utterly repugnant
to the U. (J. students and they may
have ardently desired its removal,
but if the situation had been re
versed Stanford students would ob
ject to the manner of removal.
Any worthless old bench that we
might have down here would sud
denly assume no slight value if it
were lorn from our campus and re
moved to their own. However, that
is not the way they feel about it
and those present seniors who have
not found it necessary to perpetu
ate their names on their senior (J
fence are satistied to still consider
it unnecessarv to carve on ours.
