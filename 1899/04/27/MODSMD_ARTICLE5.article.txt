# THEY ARE GRATEFUL.
## The 						Students of U. C. Were in a Quandary over the Fence and We Saved Them. 
### 
The following in taken from the
J/<itly California a of Wednesday
morning :
The morning following the Bour
don was marked hy the absence of
an old encumbrance from the cam
pusâ€”ihe Senior C. The first sur
mise was that the Freshmen might
have made use of it in their cele
bration of the night before, but
this was set at rest by their denials.
It was next supposed that some of
the West Berkeley contingent who
usually infest the campus on occa
sions like the Bourdon, might have
made off with it. Another theory
gained color from the signature
Stanford on the backstop, that a
delegation from down the bay, in
misguided retaliation for the vi et
armits episode of the axe, had come
and carried off the fence, furtim et
node. A hammer and saw were
left on the premises and can be had
by the claimant.
The Californian, both formerly
and of more recent date, has voiced
objections to the C as a dismal fail
ure to introduce an alien college
custom, and among the students
yesterday the sentiment was a con
census of relief at the absence of the
unsightly and useless object from
the campus. Captains of Fresh
man companies feit especial relief
at the removal of the obstacle.
President Thomas of the Asso
ciated Students said: "If Stan
ford took the 0 it certainly was a
baby act. The fence stands for
nothing in intercollegiate affairs.
It was merely taking a piece of
property less valuable than our
backstop and we shall certainly
make no attempt to recover so
worthless a possession. It is really
a great relief that it is gone."
Earle Swan said : " That fence
was the worst false alarm ever in
college. If anybody wanted to
make landing to warm cold feet,
they were welcome to it."
Bart Thane said: "No matter
who took the Senior Fence, it is a
good thing. The class of' 99 thought
of taking it down, considering it a
disgrace to the campus."
I. J. M uina said : " Revenge ? It
was kid's play. The fence belonged
to the Seniors and not to the col
lege at all. Nobody ever sat on it
and the next class has been relieved
from the embarrassment of demol
ishing it."
(i. B. Lorenz, '02, said : " We
took the axe and Stanford took of
fense."
The following is the editorial
comment from the same issue:
Those individuals who kindly
removed the Senior C last Monday
evening may possibly lit* visited by
the fulfillment of those awful curses
which were promised to its destruct
ors by the class of "98 at the time
of the fence's erection, but as far as
the present student body is con
cerned, we are of but one opinion
We do not in the least regret its
loss. Those who have the useless
wood may keep it; they are wel
come. The fence served its only
purpose in drawing the class of '1)8
together at the time of its dedica

lion. The members of that class
carved their names upon it and sat
upon it because they knew that they
had built it and felt that it ought
to be occupied. Since that time it
has proved worse than worthless.
The present seniors have not found
it necessary to perpetuate their
names in just that manner and on
the whole seem to have been too
busy to sit long on hard wood in a
broiling sun. And so, as far as we
are concerned, its removal is a thing
for which we are to be thoroughly
thankful.
As to the town toughs who seem
possessed of the idea that Bourdon
means a free for all fight and the
general destruction of any Univer
sity property left unguarded, we
can only say that the action shows
the man. Whether they came from
the West Berkeley stock-yards or
from a more distant, more disagree
able place, they proved themselves
hut common rowdies worthy of our
common contempt.
