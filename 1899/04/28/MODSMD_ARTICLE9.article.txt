# Taylor on De Heredia.
## 
### 
Dr. Edward Robeson Taylor, one
of the original trustees of the Uni
versity, lectured before the class in
French 5 on the sonnets of De
Heredia yesterday. Dr. Taylor is
well qualified to speak on the work
of this French poet, since he has
made an excellent translation of
the sonnets into English, which has
gone through two editions. His
translation, in fact, is the standard
of De Heredia in English, the
translation having lost nothing of
the original charm and force of the
poems, so that his opinions and
estimates of the poet are authori
tative.
