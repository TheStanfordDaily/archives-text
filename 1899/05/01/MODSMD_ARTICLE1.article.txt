# THE "QUAD."
## The Junior Annual, Which the Editors Say Surpasses all Others, Out on Wednesday.
### 
Posters announcing the appear
ance of the Quad for Wednesday
morning are out today. The hook
has been delayed one day on ac
count of the fence-stealing, which
nt this late date claims space in the
annual. Editor Irwin's labors are
finished and he is highly satisfied
with the hook. From him the fol
lowing information was obtained:
Printers anil binders express the
greatest satisfaction with the book,
which is a beauty throughout. It
is thoroughly modern in details of
type, paper, and finish â€”far more
up-to-date, in fact, than any Quad
which this University has yet pro
duced. It abounds in noveliies,
ami considerable expense has been
incurred in order to produce taste
iul and harmonious effects through
out. it is bound in brown vellum
and red cloth and is stamped in
gold, lis shape, while not radically
different from previous years, is new
and pleasing. The literary contents,
which have been mentioned form
erly, we can now touch upon in
more detail. The three most prom
inent stories are interesting because
they treat of the three important
phases of Stanford life, namely:
The two halls, the chapter-house,
and ihe I'aio Alto boarding house.
The prize story "The Tale of a Col
lar," by L. MacK. Bowman, is ex
ceedingly well written; .J. S. Bris
coe's "Beta Tail Celebrity" treats of
the fraternity question in a humor
ous vein, while "His Junior Plug,"
by Mildred Stanford, is as lifelike
and clever a little story as one could
wish to read.
Charles lv. Field,'9s, has favored
the Quad with a beautiful verse
with a Japanese setting, entitled
"At Nagasaki." Among under
graduate verse will appear ''Ghosts,"
by Will 11. Irwin, '99; "A Cat
Tale,'' bv George Herbert Yost, '911;
"Outwitted," by F. P>. Hi ley, '00;
"The Quad in Summer," by Wal
lace A. Irwin. '00; "When ye Girl
Comes in," by L.MacF.Bowman,'ol;
"Twilight." by Joseph Elmer Wil
son, '01, and " ihe End of the Year,"
by Joseph 11. Hamilton, '01. A
number of humorous jingles will
also appear.
The editors wish to announce
that the anti-cartoon law has not
intimidated them in the least and
that "kodaks" and other "grinds"
will appear in greater force than
ever before. The events and mis
haps of the year have lie en fully
remembered, including a recent
episode of note.
An index will appear in ihe back
of the book.
