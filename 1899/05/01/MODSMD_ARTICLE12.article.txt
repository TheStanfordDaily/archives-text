The practice of "swiping" wheels
has been carried to such an extent
that it is now unsafe to leave a
wheel anywhere on the campus
without a lock and chain. Some
thing should be done to put a stop
to the practice before it is carried
any further. \\'e suggest that the
wheelmen organize and appoint a
vigilance committee.
