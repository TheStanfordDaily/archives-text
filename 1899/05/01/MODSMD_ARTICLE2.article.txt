The annual Intercollegiate Chest*
Tournament between Berkeley an 1
Stanford Universities took place
Saturday in the rooms of the San
Francisco Chess Cluh. Our players
made a much better showing than
was expected of them. They won
three and a half games out of seven.
The eighth game was not played
because Durrell, one of our players,
did not put in an appearance.
The score resulted as follows:
Khuart (U. C ) beat Gray (S.),

Sobey (S.) beat Hunter (U. C.),
Bennett (S.) beat Euphrat (U.C.),
Hennings (U. C.) beat Mclntyre
(S.), Whitaker (S.) beat Gorden
ker (U. C.), Epstein (IJ. C.) beat
Bard (S.), Van Kaathoven (S.)
and Baugh (U. C.) drew. Total:
Stanford University of Califor
nia 3A.
The University of California did
not claim a forfeit on account of
Durrell's failure to put in an ap
pearance. The game between him
and Parkhurst, his Berkeley oppo
nent, will decide the tournament,
as there is wide disparity between
the two players, the result of the
tournament was practically a vic
tory for Berkeley.
Judge Cowdery looked after our
interests during the contest, and
Professor Haskell performed a sim
ilar service for the Berkeley players.
