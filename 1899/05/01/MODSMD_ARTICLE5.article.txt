# Sunday Sermon.

### 
Rev. 11. C. Foute of Grace Epis
copal Church, San Francisco, oc
cupied the chapel pulpit Sunday
morning. Before the sermon Miss
Nella Rogers of the University of
the Pacific rendered the solo, "In
Dreams I have heard the Angels."
The subject of Dr. Koute's sermon
was "Doubt: Its Cause and Cure."
lie said in part: Doubt is one
of the fundamental elements of our
nature. We are in doubt concern
ing what is right and true, and
more especially concerning points
of doctrine.
It is not surprising to find peo
ple doubting Christianity. Christ
himself recognized this. Just so
long as a man feels in doubt his
efforts are paralyzed. Every man
who thinks for himself must be
more or less in doubt. Doubt
gives an attitude of interest and
investigation. Honest doubt is
more safe than a careless accept
ance ot doctrine.
If ignorance is the cause of
doubt, knowledge is the cure; doubt
vanishes before knowledge. The
various methods <>112 acquiring
knowledge are: first, by study; sec
ond by reason; third, by personal
experience. The last is the only
sure method. Ail other methods
are open to error and liable to mis
take.
Cod does not put our religion
out of our reach, but rmikes it sub
ject to laws of experience and the
test of practical use â€”the wear and
tear of daily life. Every one should
give it a fair trial. Christianity
stands upon the same identical
common sense footing its anything
else. It is thrown broadcast into
a practical world, and is in tin
world for the world to use. There
are none who have not felt the
need of it.

In the darkest hours of disap
pointment, when one's hopes have
been clashed (suddenly to the earth,
when one lias fallen into the deep
est depths, let him then honestly
and fervently test the doctrines of
Christianity. If (Jod hear him
not, if Jesus does not sustain him,
if there comes to him no ray of
light or help, then, and not till
then, let him deny Christ and God.
