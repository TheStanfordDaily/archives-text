### 
At the meeting of the Senior
Week Committee at 1 p.m. Wed
nesday drawings will he made for
the booths at the Promenade Con
cert by the representatives of the
sororities and other organizations.
The booths have always been a
pretty feature of the Promenade
Concert, and undoubtedly will be
so this year as there will be nine
organizations represented.
Music for the Promenade will be
given this year by Heunet's Concert
Hand of twenty-live or thirty pieces,
which will play twelve numbers,
with catchy,popular airs for encores.
A neat souvenir program will be
issued for the occasion, which is
the most distinctive feature of the
Stanford Commencement. A large
committee will soon be appointed
to take charge of the decorating of
the quadrangle, which it is desired
to make unusually unique.
