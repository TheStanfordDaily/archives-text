# COMBINED CONCERT.
## Stanford and California Musical Clubs Join Forces in the Alhambra in San Francisco. 
### 
Stanford and California combined
their musical forces for the lirst
time in several years Saturday
night and rendered an excellent
and versatile program.
The Stanford Glee gave the open
ing number and gained immediate
favor, evidenced by a double encore.
It also closed tlie program, singing
" Good Night," which was the best
rendered vocal number of the even
ing. Tlie California Mandolin Club
played " Butterfly Caprice" in a
pleasing manner, but tiie encore
showed less preparation. This
Cluli's number, " Whistling llufus,"
which came later in the evening,was
perhaps the best thing they did,
and bore comparison to the in
fectious "Hag Time Baby" as played
by our Mandolin Club.
Dick Culver came next. He was
at his best and entertained in a
capital manner, bis work winning
the approval of every one.
The Stanford Mandolin Club
made their debut in "Cleon Waltzes"
and won the audience at the start.
The Club's versatility was shown
in this number and in the encore,
' Stars and Stripes.", Mr. Kuster,
the U. C. celloist, played Galte
tnann's "Nocturne" very delight
fully, and Mr. Black, also of U. C.,
followed with a rattling banjo solo
which pleased everybody.
Frank Riley, for Stanford, took
the house by storm. His work was
never better received and he was
the recipient, of live or six recalls.
Financially the concert was not
a success, it failing to pay its own
expenses, which were of course quite
heavy. The Clubs are still in debt
and may schedule a last concert on
the campus, which, with the receipts
of next Friday's San Jose concert,
may prove sufficient to balance
their account.
