Extracts from letter of Ilufus
Buck, '95 :
Dawson City, March 26, IS!)!).
" Here I am with my hands
dirty. If you remember about
your last lecture to me, or I might
better say your last won! of advice
to me, it was to get to work and get
my hands diity. Well, at present
I am planning a drainage system
for Dawson City. William Ogilvie,
chief executive, has put the work
into my hand* and I've been sur
veying the town, running levels,
etc. My assistant is Albert Gardner,
'!)(i. I get per day for myself
and assistant and work government
hours. I surveyed a tram line this
winter in December on the summit

between Hunker Creek and Domin
ion. The temperature was 40 de
grees below zero —sometimes 45 be
low. Fur mits and wool gloves
were necessary, also several sweat
ers and a fur cap. Feet in about
three pairs of German socks arid
moccasins. The transit telescope
moved terribly hard and all the
screws seemed glued. Perhaps my
lingers were not numb! M. \Y.
Greer, I*. (J in '91, was my assist
ant that time. I always manage
to get a Stanford boy. Greer is in
the States now. The Cotton boys
are both here. They look different
in Klondyke costume from what
they used to on the quad.
If any of the boys want to know
if there is any chance of work for
engineers, teli them the chances are
not very promising, unless they are
dominion land surveyors of Can
ada. This is a tine country for
day labor with pick and shovel.
Labor is getting cheaper now. Men
are working for $100 and $150 per
month and board. A year ago it
was $1.50 per hour. The best men
this winter get $1 per hour.
1 have not made a fortune yet,
but I have come so near it that it
would take your breath away.
There are good chances yet for lill
ing my sack. Living expenses are
high, and unless a man makes his
money all at once it is hard to
amass any considerable amount.
(At present condensed milk is $1
per can. Butter is $1.50 per pound.
Beef has been 20 cents per pound
by the quarter, but 40 and 50 cents
per pound has been the regular
price. Flour is $14 and $1G per
hundred, beans $12.50. Bacon sells
for 80 cents per pound. Sugar is
high —(50 and 75 cents per pound;
whiskey $80 per gallon, 25 cents a
drink, and lots of it.) The Daw
son steam beer is poor; we have
Rainier beer from Seattle. The
finest thing is the wild game,
moose and caribou. Caribou is
most delicious meat, just like the
breast of a duck.
We have three dance halls going
continually; two give a show every
night. Dance with a pretty maid
(some are 40 years) and promenade
to the bar >nly costs you $1.00.
That is the chief amusement. Hot
tifnes when some Eldorado King
brings from live to ten pounds of
gold down to dance and drink on,
or play at faro.
The sun has just commenced to
thaw things a little. The ice will
not break up until May 10.
