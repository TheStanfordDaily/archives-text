The reports of the Treasurer of
the Associated Students which have
appeared in the columns of the
Daily Palo Alto this year call at
tention to the fact that that olhce
is a position requiring no slight
business and adininistialive abil
ity. More but-iness has been done
this year than ever before. Treas
urer Fickert has still some $bOU of
outstanding obligations, which will
leave about $2000 in the treasury
at the close of his administration.
When it is remembered that only
$ObU passed into his hands at lite
beginning of tlie year, and that
many of the expenses have been
unusually heavy, the greatest praise
is due to Fickert â€”the more so be
cause at no time has money needed
for any enterprise been withheld.
Future treasurers will be grateful
to him for the systematization lie
has introduced into the olhce.
They can refer to the records pig
eon-holed in the oflice desk which
he purchased, and can profit
by the experiences of their prede
cessors and not be obliged, as for
merly, each to hew out his own
way, and gain his own experience
as he proceeds.
