YOSEMITE
VALLEY
THIS WONDERFUL CREATION OF
NATURE IS KOW AT ITS BEST
Just what that means, however, the ablest
writers and the most talented artists have been
unable to tell us. They have written volumes
and have painted the very heavens in their ef
forts to do the subject justice, but in despair
have tinally exclaimed
Go and Sea for Yourself
Now, that's good advice. You will tlud
there a narrow, crooked chasm seven miles
lon«, with rugged battlemented walls I O times
higher than the highest building. Vuu will
tlnd water falls leaping from vertical clilts | 6
times higher than Niagara. You will see moun
tain parks studded with every variety of forest
tree aud flowering shrub. You will see thun
dering torrents, roaring cataracts, beautiful
lakes, inspiring skies, brilliant rainbows, a
wealth of ferns and plant beauty, and all the
birds of the air bursting their very throats iu
song for the pure ecstaey of living.
THE TRIP HAS NO HARDSHIPS
