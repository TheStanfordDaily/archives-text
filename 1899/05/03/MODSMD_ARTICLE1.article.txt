With the program thus outlined
work has been concentrated upon
each feature and subcommittees
have been appointed to take charge
of each separate event. The great
est burden thus for has fallen upon
the collectors of the $5 class assess
ment, and it is especially urged that
all assessments should be paid by
the tenth of this month so that the
necessary obligations can be cal
culated and met before graduation
The printing for Commencement
Week is in itself no small item. A
striking souvenir program for the
week is now on the press and will
be placed on sale next week with
the Commencement invitations, and
will rank higher than any souvenir
before issued.
Appropriate programs for the
Ball and Promenade Concert are
also being prepared. Invitations
for the Encina Club reception to
the Senior Class will also be issued
soon.
The program for Class Day ex
ercises has been completed and

Class Song.
An event not heretofore included
on other programs will lie the
Encina Club reception to the Senior
Class and their friends The object
is to foster acquaintance and to af
ford an opportunity for leave-taking
to the undergraduates who do not
remain for Commencement.
Much of the Senior Extravaganza
—Atalanta at Stanford, by W. H.
Irwin —will depend upon the com
pletion of the Assembly llall. If
the Assembly Hall is ready by
Class Day the play will be given
there under the most favorable con
ditions, and the staging will lie ad
mirable. A large cast is working
under Mr. Irwin's coaching and the
management boasts of forty people
on the stage at once. The orchestra
and chorus are busily practicing
for the performance.
The ball committee has decided
to hold the class dance in Encina
Clubroom as has been the custom —
with calcium light effects. Yanke's
Orchestra has been engaged. Tickets
are five dollars.
For the Promenade Concert Ben
nett's Concert Band of twenty-five
pieces has been engaged. Arrange
ments for the booths were completed
today. A large committee will be
announced to take, charge of the
decoration of the quadrangle. The
caterer for the occasion will soon
be selected.
