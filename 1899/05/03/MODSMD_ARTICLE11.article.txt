# Australian Comment.

President Jordan has just re
ceived, through the kindness of .J.
P. Bray, United UtatesConsul Gen
eral of Australia, a long clipping
from the Melbourne Herald which
speaks of the interest and attention
paid to Stanford University in far
away Australia.
The piece, which was originally
written for Chambers' Magazine,
comments upon the widespread in
terest taken in the University
founded upon the western coast so
far from the old centers of learn
ing. An accurate description of
the college and a biography of the
founder's life is included, and then
follows a long comparison of the
methods followed here and else
where. California is complimented
upon the close union of colleges
and preparatory schools as differ
ing from places where 'we spend
many an hour pouring over the
calendar in the attempt to elucidate
from the ordinances of my lords,
the commissioners, the various sub
jects and groups of subjects neces
sary for the entrance examina
tion."
Further favorable comment is
made upon the Stanford elective
systeui which, as the writer says,
"permits the student, if he chooses,
to assay gold quartz in the mining
school one hour, read Plato with
the professor of Greek the next
hour, and analyze manure in the
agricultural department at an
other."
Stanford University, he says, fur
nishes an education which fits a
student for life, and is not, accord
ing to Lowell's definition, "a place
where nothing useful is taught."
