# "THE WASTE OF WAR."
## A 						Study of the Economic and Moral Disadvantages of Modern Warfare. 
### 
Rev. Charles R. Brown of Oak
land lectured last evening on " The
Waste of War." The subject did
not promise anything novel, yet
Mr. Brown gave a thoroughly wide
awake, modern study of modern
war methods and their place in the
economics of developing nations.
In the first consideration, the
financial advantages of war, Mr.
Brown reviewed the cost of the
most important of recent wars. He
discussed the value to a nation of a
productive policy and showed how
war, in itself non-productive, de
stroys the nation's productive forces
by singling out and destroying the
best of the country's population.
War is a luxury too expensive for
clear brained financiers to encour
age. The war footing mounts in
expense to be the first item of the
budget of all the modern nations.
If there were an international ac
ceptance of the simple soundness of
peace policy, these enormous
amounts would be either lifted from
the popular taxation or turned into
productive enterprise. "In the
name, then, not of God, not of hu
manity, but of plain common sense,
war must be abolished."
In the days of chivalry contests
of arms decided personal bravery ;
quickness of mind, as well as
the simple muscular superiority.
Armies were made up of men that
fought against enemies with the
strongest powers of their race and
personality bearing against foe.
Wars were gained or lost according
to the tests of a nation's stamina of
greatness. Butin these days we have
a mixture of medieval armies and
modern machinery. We send a
company of our bravest soldiers
into the face of a machine-gun that
mows them all. The man at the
gun may be a weakling. The men
destroyed may be the highest type
of bravery and skill, but machinery
has put bravery and individual
perseverance absolutely at naught.
The modern engines of war make
battle a test beyond the limits of
nerve force to endure. War has
become a vast series of mechanical
and chemical experiments. If it is
said that modern nations will not
allow the use of these most terrible
traps and explosives, then the
| argument is contradictory. War is
an effort at destruction, and no
means can be ruled out on the gen
eral premises. War will become so
terrible that its very terror shall
insure peace.
The individual today owes the
conveniences and the necessities of
everyday living to productions of
people the world around. The
more intimate the commercial and
social relations, the more repug
nant will become the idea of war
and its consequent destruction of
commercial interests and inter
course. Whether it is right or not to
make commercial interests para
mount, the fact remains, they are
growing to be so. .Interdependence
of individuals increases, and draws
with it the interdependence of na
tions. It is the banking interest
more than the simple diplomacy of
a few ministers that allows or re

strains wars today. Development
is hindered by war. War is not a
means of development, but an ac
companiment of it. It is the mere
ebullition of surplus animal en
ergy. Politically, war will become
impossible.
There is the moral side of the
question, and from it also war is
no mark of the highest develop
ment. Humanitarianism increases.
Once twenty thousand men were
driven to death to build a pyra
mid. Now the public cures for a
wounded beggar. At one time
duelling was the statement of
honor. Now public opinion will
not allow it. If two men shall not
be allowed to waste two lives, shall
two nations be permitted to stake
and waste their thousands. The
parallel is not strained.
In conclusion, Mr. Brown referred
to the Peace Conference just closed,
and to ihe motives of the Czar in
calling it. War may yet be in
some instances needed to solve
great questions of justice, but just
ice can not be measured by mechan
ical and chemical skill.
