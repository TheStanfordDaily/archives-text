The Athletic Committee met this
afternoon and transacted routine
business. Jarman and Edwards,
two old time bicyle men who won
points against Berkeley in the
early field-days, were given per
mission to wear the regulation
white block S; the motion was
made to read so that any former
point-winner would he entitled to
the same privilege.
The committee also voted a large
old-English 8 for the members of
the second team of the football
squad. The letter is to be six
inches tall and to be worn to the
left of the center of the sweater.
The advisibility of having an
alumnus as permanent member of
the committee was then discussed,
and the consensus of opinion was
that such a member would he a
good addition to the present, body.
It was found by investigating the
Constitution of the Associated Stu
dents that such a member could
only he elected by amending the
Constitution, so the Committee
merely offered a suggestion that
some future action be taken on the
matter.
