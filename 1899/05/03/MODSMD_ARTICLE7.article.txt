Treasurer Fisher of the Senior
Class is making strenuous efforts to
collect the class assessments, hut
despite all his perseverance not
half the class has yet paid up.
The program of Commencement
Week published in today's paper
indicates how necessary it is that
every member of the class pay his
dues immediately. The bills of the
class, many of them for large sums,
are now becoming due and business
men are prone to regard with sus

a college class. Unless the treas
urer can meet his obligations as
they fall due, he will be hampered
in his efforts to do further business.
Every member of '99 should realize
this and do his share to obviate the
difficulty.
