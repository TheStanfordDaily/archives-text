# A 						FULL LAW COURSE.
## The 						Law Department of the University to Offer Graduate Law Work Leading to the LL. B. Degree. 
### 
Hitherto the Department of Law
has attempted only to give courses
equivalent to the first year work of
the best law schools; hut it is now
possible and the time seems oppor
tune to begin complete law school
work. For the present the plan
will be to have three years of work
in law, one of which must
he completed by undergraduates
as the required work for the
degree of Bachelor of Arts in
Law, and the other two years will
be graduate work leading to the
degree of Bachelor of Laws. The
aim is to offer to graduates of the
University the complete preparat ion
for practice which they h tve here
tofore had to .seek elsewhere, and to
provide for graduates of other uni
versities a full law course. The
undergraduate work will be so ar
ranged that regular undergraduate
students may pursue it part each
year, beginning with their second
year in the University, while stu
denlsentering the Law department
from other universities will be able
to take ali the undergraduate work
during their first year in the
department. In the past many in
quiries have been received as to
entering the University on the sup
position thai it offered a full law
course. Such parties have had to
be advised that they could not
judiciously come here under the
circumstances then existing. It is
gratifying to think that in the future
such applications may receive fa
vorable response.
Next year the building which is
at present used for a library will be
occupied entirely by the Law De
partment. It will be subdivided
intosuitable recitation rooms,oflices,
and study rooms.
In this connection it seems ap
propriate to call attention to what
has been called the "Stanford plan"
of combining law school and Uni
versity work. At the meeting of
the American Bar Association in
1896, in a paper by Professor Huff
cut of the Cornell Law School, on
the "Relation of the Law School to
the University" he reduced the
law school system to three classes:
the first represented by Harvard,
the stcond by Stanford and the
third being a modification of the
Stanford pirn in use at Columbia,
Cornell, and some other schools.
Extracts from Professor Huffcut's
address have heretofore been pub
lished in this paper. It will now
be noticed that the University is
able for the first time to put into
full operation the "Stanford plan.'
The fact that a complete law school
course can be added and take its
place in the University system
without friction and without de
ranging any other part of the Uni
versity work is the best demonstra
tion of the perfection of the system
devised and here lirst set in opera
tion by President Jordan.
Beginning with the fall semester,
1 <599, the following courses will be
offered in the Law department:

The following regulations will be

The provisions of the Register,
except as hereby modified, will
continue in effect.
ADMISSION.
Students may enter the Univer
sity as first year students, making
law their major subject, just as
heretofore.
Students who enter the Univer
sity receiving advanced standing
may take such law work as they
would be permitted to take had
they gotten their previous training
here. Students who receive ninety
hours advanced standing may
spend their last year in doing all
the undergraduate work in law.
Graduates of other universities
or colleges of good standing, who
enter the department, will take all
the undergraduate law work the
first year and the graduate work
in succeeding years.
Special students who show suf
ficient qualification will be ad
mitted to the department, but not
as candidates for degrees.
ORDER OF COURSES.
The undergraduate work in law,
except in the case of special stu
dents, and students entering with
ninety hours advanced standing,
or diplomas from other institu
tions, can n.it be begun until the
second year of University work.
It will he distributed over the sec
ond, third, and fourth years, sub
stantia 11 y as at present.
The graduate work must, betaken
after receiving the A. B. degree in
law. Owing to the fact that some
of the graduate courses will for the
present be given on alternate years,
graduate students may take courses
scheduled for either graduate year,
as found most convenient.
In consideration of the fact that
some undergraduate students have
already anticipated part of the
graduate work, the following teni
pora ry regula lions a re made :
Undergraduates will be allowed
to take graduate courses by special
permission from the instructor.
Candidates for the degree of
LL. B. will be allowed a leave of
absence from the I' ni versil v during
their second gradu ite year.
DEGREES.
The degree of A. B. in law will
be given as heretofore to students
meeting the University require
ments and completing the under

graduate work in law. For the
present, undergraduate students
who are permitted to take graduate
work in law will be allowed to sub
stitute that for equivalent under
graduate work and so count it to
ward their lirst degeee.
The degree of LL. B. will be given
to students who, having received the
A. B. degree or its equivalent, com
plete ten courses of graduate work
in law.
The courses offered for the year
1899-1900 may be found in the
next Schedule, which will be pub
lished in a few days.
Mr. Chas. R. Lewers, A. 8., Law,
'1)6, who graduates from the Har
vard Law School this June, has
been added to the law faculty.
There will also be an additional
lecturer. Mr. Abbott will take a
year's leave of absence for study at
Harvard. Thus, for next year the
faculty will consist of Mr. Whittier,
Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Lewers, Judge
Lindley, and some other non-resi
dent lecturer.
