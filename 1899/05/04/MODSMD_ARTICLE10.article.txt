The Junior Quad, which ap
peared yesterday, took advantage
of the experience of its predecessors
in many respects, and while it is
not a radical improvement on
Ninety-nine's, there is a more even
tone. The distribution of art
through the literary part is per
haps the most felicitous work of
the editors, and helps in no small
degree the general impression left
by a perusal of the work. The
Stanford Annuals are the most
elaborate and carefully prepared
in the whole country, and the con
stant desire to itnj rove them is
making them more and more clever
pieces of book-work. Compared to
them, Eastern annuals are more in
the nature of catalogs of college
records, with much less literary
and artistic material. Perhaps
the present Quad has not reached
the climax of Stanford Annuals,
but a desire to improve greatly
upon it is apt to lead future classes

into bankrupting propositions.
There should be- :i limit set to de
sire in this regard, and ii improve
ment is to be made in the future, it
should be in the care taken with
the preparation of material, rather
than the introduction of new and
more ambitious features.
