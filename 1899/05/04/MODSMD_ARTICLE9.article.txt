The thanks of the Senior Class
and of the entire student body are
due to Mr. Morris who has so
kindly volunteered to train the
chorus for Commencement Week.
The progress the Chorus is making
is sufficient testimony to his abil
ity. It is no slight effort for Mr.
Morris to come up to the Uni
versity to take charge of this work,
and yet he has done it simply out
of a desire that the music for the
graduating exercises may be of as
high grade as possible. Mr. Morris
has always shown a loyalty to
the University in its musical affairs
and this is simply another indica
tion of the same spirit.
