YOSEMITE
VALLEY
THIS WONDERFUL CREATION OF
NATURE IS r.OW AT ITS BEST
Just what that means, however, the ablest
writers and the most talmted artists have; been
unable to tell us. They have written volumes
and have painted ilie very heavens in their ef
forts to do the subject justice, but in despair
have tinally exclaimed
Go and See for Yourself
Now, that's good advice. You will llnd
there a narrow, crooked chasm seven miles
lout,', with rugged battleincnted walls | 0 times
higher than the highest building. Vou will
find water falls leaping from vertical cliffs | 6
times higher than Niagara. You will see moun
tain parks studded with every variety of forest
tree and (lowering shrub. You will'see thun
dering torrents, roaring cataracts, beautiful
lakes, Inspiring skies, brilliant rainbows, a
wealth of ferns and plant beauty,-and all the
birds of the air bursting their very throats in
song for the pure ecstacy of living.
THE TRIP HAS NO HARDSHIPS
You go in a luxurious sleeping-car to within
65 miles ot the Valley, and the remainder of the
way iu comfortable coaches over a tine turn
pike.
Hotel rites iu the Valley are from $•.' ;"»(> to
$4.01) per day; and the charges for guides and
saddle animals vary from frl.uo fora trip on the
floor of the Valley, to $1 (M» for an all day trip up
the difficult trails.
