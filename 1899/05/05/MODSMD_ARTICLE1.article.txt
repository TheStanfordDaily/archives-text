Some inquiry has heen heard
among the student hody since the
elections as to any possible changes
in the publications of next year.
•J. T. Nourse, editor of the Daily
Palo Alto for next semester, has
a few changes in contemplation
which, it is thought, will add to
the general interest of the paper.
An endeavor will be made.to keep
in touch with the alumni and
former students of the University,
and thus make the paper of greater
interest to them.
An addition will he made to the
staff of an athletic editor, who will
he in fn.l touch with the men, and
whose duty it will lie to promote
their interests to the fullest extent.
An agreement has been made
under which Ihe paper will appear
not later than six o'clock, and in
order to accomplish this all mater
ial must he in by four.
With these few attempted im
provements the management will
be content to continue the stand
ard set by editors of previous years.
Editor Irwin of the Sequoia says
that his ideas of any '"policy'' for
the year are not-at all fixed, it, is
possible that the size of the page
may be reduced and the number of
pages in the magazine increased.
li«- intends also to confer the title
of associate editor .upon fewer per
sons than has been customary in
the past.
Work on the Stanford Alinnnus
is progressing favorably.
it. has been thought that there is
a chance here fora humorous paper
somewhat on the lines of those of
the larger Eastern colleges. There
fore the two editors-in-chief of this
year's papers, E. \V. Smith, '99, of
the Daily Palo Alto, and Bristow
Adams,'oo, of [he Stanford Sequoia,
have combined and will publish
the Eucalyptus, a full prospectus
of which will appear in the Com
