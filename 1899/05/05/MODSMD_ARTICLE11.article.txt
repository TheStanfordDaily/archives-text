custom of Eastern universities and
present a French play in the orig
inal. The piece selected is the
bright comedy ' La Poudre aux
Yeux," hy Labiche and Martin. It

appropriate stage settings. A well
selected cast has heen rehearsing
for several weeks under the direc
tion of Dr. Matzke, Mr. 11. C Nash
and Professor Davidson, and prom
ises to give a performance which
will in every way he a genuine lit
erary and dramatic treat.
Among those who will appear is
Professor Davidson, who leaves lit
tle to he desired in the character of
Malingear. Miss Cook is another
star. As Madame Malingear she
speaks a delightful French and
shows much skill in her acting. F.
L. Dully and Mrs. Bacon are excel
lent in the ditticult roles of Mon
sieur and Madame Ratinois. Much
interest in the play centers in the
clever acting of Sumner Robinson
and Miss Florence Dunbar who
play Frederic and Emmeline, the
two lovers.
Miss Lottie 10. Brand as Alexan
drine, and Miss Emmahelle Zucker
as .Josephine, add much life and
brightness to the play. P. E. Biber
appears as "Un Tapissier." C. 11.
(ireenleaf gives an amusing por
trayal of the pompous Maitre
d'Hotel.
Frank Riley will play Robert,
the simple and honest old " Var
chand de hois,'" who unwinds the
complications of the play in the

last act. Owing to the lack of seat
ing capacity in the Roble parlor
the attendance will he hy invitation
only. Dr. Matzke lias issued neat
invitations and programs, which
will he sent out hy the cast during
the week.
