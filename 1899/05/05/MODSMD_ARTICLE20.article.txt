The staff of the Daily Palo Alto
for the second semester of the year
18U8-99 has with this issue finished
its labors. The editor-in-chief takes
it upon himself to thank them not
only for himself, which he does
with a deep appreciation of their
painstaking assistance, but also
for the student body, for whom
they have labored to produce a
newspaper with no other reward
than thanks and even that too often
forg< tten. No one can realize the de
ficiencies of a paper at the end of the
term more than the editor-in-chief
for that term. The present editor
is keenly aware of all the defects of
this semester's Daily Palo Alto,
and cheerfully accepts what blame
there is. To those members of the
staff who have labored most faith
fully on the paper belongs the
credit for any merit which the
paper may have shown.
