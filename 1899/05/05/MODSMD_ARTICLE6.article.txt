# Statistics in Head Measurements.
## 
### 
Mr. (J. (J. Closson, a, graduate of
the University of Chicago, lms heen
gathering statistics during the last
few weeks of the men of the Univer
sity.* The results of army statis
tics gathered from the recruits in
the French and German forces
have led to a hypothesis that the
physical characteristics of mankind
to a certain extent determine ihe
moral characteristics and ability of
men. This was particularly notice
able in the recruits to the army of
the German state of Baden, where
two distinct head-forms, with
many gradations between, were
noted. The Alpine type, the peas
ant class, was characterized by the
round form of head, while the long,
narrow head seemed to be charac
teristic of the ambitious, migratory
disposition.
Statistics along the same lines
have been gathered at Harvard
and at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. The study is in
dependent of the others, but, its re
sults will be compared with them
and published some time during th is
summer.
Mr. Closson is also engaged in
studying the size of the family in
the educated classes. Statistics
have heen collected as to the aver
age size of the family among the
lower classes, and a study is now
being made of the size of the fam
ily among the higher classes to de
termine what, if any, effect educa
tion and refinement have on the
number in the family. The study
will afford data, though necessarily
incomplete, as to the size of the
family among Californians.
