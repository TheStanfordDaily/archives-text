The California Northwestern Railway
(Lessee San Francisco and North Pacific Railway)
the picturesque route of California
FREE CAMPING
In Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake Counties the Camper finds his natural home, ft may
be alongside a quiet stream in the valley, or by the mountain brook as it tumbles down the canyon ;
perhaps on the bank of a river, the shore of a lovely lake, or in tlie mountain glades under the tower
ing redwood.
The spot for an ideal camp is under shade trees, contiguous to a stream. In these counties there
are, besides a number of lakes, 300 streams, Russian, Eel and other rivers, furnishing over 6,000 miles
of water length, which are kept well stocked with trout from the lish hatchery of the California
Northwestern Railway, at Ukiah.
Whilst many like to camp out in the country, far away from tlie railroad, many wish to be near
their homes, so that father, son or brother and friends can make frequent visits. For these, attention
is called to the following picturesque spots, which are especially adapted to campers, and are of easy
access to San Francisco :
On the Sonoma branch of the California Northwestern Railway is
GLEN ELLEN PARK. This park contains fifty-five acres, beautifully shaded. Sonoma, an
excellent trout stream, and one of the prettiest creeks in the State, bounds the Park on the north and
affords safe bathing. This Park is free to Campers, and in addition, the country for four miles along
the Sonoma creek. Mr. C. E. Harvey, Agent California Northwestern Railway Co., at Glen Ellen,
will show locations.
MIRABEL PARK, is 011 our Guerneville branch, twelve miles from Santa Rosa. The train
stops at the Park, and Mr. Ogburn, the party in charge, will be on hand to receive and locate Camp
ers. Mark West creek skirts the Park and is dammed, affording fine bathing, fishing and boating.
Boats for hire at reasonable rental.
GUERNEVILLE, in the midst of the Redwood country, and on the Russian river, is practically
the terminus of the Guerneville Branch. The people of the town and vicinity, under the name of the
Business Men's Association of Guerneville, offer free camping sites throughout the whole section. The
Russian river will be dammed, affording a magnificent sheet of water for bathing and boating. Mr.
D. Council, proprietor of the livery stable at Guerneville, representing the Association, will meet all
trains, and without charge will show prospective Campers the various locations.
Between these and San Francisco there is double daily train service, and supplies of all kinds are
delivered on the grounds by the merchants of the adjoining towns.
In the Redwoods on Dougherty Creek, 21 miles from Ukiah, and on the stage road between Orr's
Hot Springs and Mendocino, are the Johnson Camping Grounds. Hunting and fishing. Produce,
etc., can be procured in the vicinity. Reached via Ukiah and Mendocino Stage line. Address, J. L.
Johnson, Ukiah.
At Soda Springs, two miles west of Christine, in the Redwoods, is excellent camping, hunting
