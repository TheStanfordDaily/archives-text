# "THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND ITS LIMITATIONS."
## The
						Commencement Address Delivered by Professor Fernando Sanford. 
### 
The century which is just clos
ing will probably always be re
membered as a period of re
markable scientific advancement.
This does not imply that
there have not been remark
able advancements made in other
lines of human activity. Probably
in no century has there been such
general and substantial progress in
all lines of intellectual activity as
in the one whose closing year is
about to dawn upon us. Much of
this activity has been due to the
scientific character of the age; much
has been in spite of it Certainly,
at no time in the world's history
has the general level of literary and
musical and artist ic culture been so
high as at the present time, and
the unprejudiced observer will not
assuredly attribute this high level
of attainment to the scientific char
acter of the age.
Hut it is also true that not in let
erary, artistic, nor even philosoph
ical lines has the best work of pre
vious centuries been surpassed,
while in every line of proper scien
tific investigation the knowledge
and doctrines of previous centuries
have become antiquated. Scarcely
a scientific theory held today is as
old as the century, and the great
generalizations upon which all nat
ural and physical science are now
based date back barely fifty years.
It is certainly well within the truth
to say that the human race has
made greater scientific progress in
our century than in the whole pre
vious period of its existence upon
the earth.
The cause of this remarkable
progress must be sought principally
in the scientific method of our age;
for while experimental science was
born about three hundred years
ago, it has only reached its mature
growth during the present century.
A brief comparison of modern ex
perimental science with the older
natural philosophy of Aristotle and
the middle ages will help make
plain the reasons for the relatively
great success of the modern meth
ods.
Hefore attempting any compari
son of their method with ours, it is
but proper that we should acknowl
edge the great debt which modern
science owes to the Greeks. Not
that their scientific knowledge was
greatly superior to that of the
rest of the world, for it
was not; but it has been said
of the (ireeks that they only,
of all the nations of antiquity, seem
to have sought fora knowable re
lation between natural phenomena.
They, alone, seem to have recog
nized that the phenomena of nature
bear a causal relation to each other,
and without a recognition of this
relation no science would be pos
sible. For science is not mere
catalogued knowledge of observed
facts. Such k now ledge must form the
groundwork upon which any true
science is built; but a knowledge of
the causal relations between the
observed facts and phenomena is j
theessential aim of all scientific in
vestigation. In all ancient nations

except the Greeks the speculations
concerning nature were of a mystic
or a religious character. Super
natural and spiritual powers were
supposed to be the causes of phys
ical phenomena, and even the
Greek natural philosophy isstrong
ly colored with these oriental su
perstitions.
Hut though the Greeks sought
for causal relations between natural
phenomena, they did not succeed
in finding a sure method of discov
ering these relations. It is true
that we are often told that all the
great generalizations of modern sci
ence were anticipated atone time or
another by Greek philosophers, but
these so-called anticipations were
nothing more than guesses, and had
no scientific value whatever. 'J he
only authority upon which any of
them rested was the philosophical
reputation of their authors, and
scientific laws are not based upon
human opinions.
The method of the Grecian nat
ural philosophy, in so far as the
scientific speculations of the phil
osophers can be characterized by
one who is compelled to rely upon
the opinions of others for most of
his idea* of (ireek science as well
as Grecian philosophy, was essen
tially the method of debate or ar
gument, which is so often mistaken
for the method of investigation,
even at the present time. It con
sisted in stating a general proposi
tion, and then, by means of logic,
in drawing all possible legitimate
conclusions from it. If the conclu
sions were not found to be contra
dictory to known facts, the general
proposition was regarded as estab
lished. Later, as methods of math
ematical analysis were developed,
these were used to assist in making
deductions from general laws—the
method still used in mathematical
physics.
In the use of the method of log
ical argument, no people have ever
surpassed, if any have ever equalled,
the ancient Greeks, and the reason
why they made almost no progress
in physical science is evidently be
cause the logical method alone is
not capable of discovering scientific
truth. The modern scientist still
uses the logical method, and as ex
pressed in the form of mathematical
analysis it is a very important in
strument of modern scientific in
vestigation, but the great achieve
ments of modern science are due to
the fact that man has learned to
arbitrarily interfere with natural
phenomena for the purpose of col
lecting and verifying the facts of
nature and of discovering their re
lations to each other. The method
of physical experimentation separ
ates the old science from the new.
When man first began to bring
about physical changes under vary-j
ing conditions, so that be might es
timate the influence of the different
elements of a phenomenon upon
the result, modern science had a j
beginning.
In this modern definition of the
term, Archimedes of Syracuse is;
generally regarded as the first
physical scientist. The (Jreeks were
philosophers, the Alexandrians were
mathematicians, but Archimedes
was an engineer and a physicist.
He united with iiis knowledge ol

the Greek philosophy and the
Egyptian mathematics the practice
of testing his conclusions by ex
i periment, and he accordingly made
i more scientific discoveries and more
mechanical inventions than almost
' all his predecessors combined.
| Hut the world was slow to take
| advantage of the method used with
| such wonderful success by Archi
| medes. Now and then a single in-
I vestigator would undertake to bring
j physical experimentation to the
I aid of his natural philosophy, and
invariably with startling results in
the way of discovery; but the nat
ural philosophy of Aristotle fur
nished the principal method of ac
quiring knowledge in the entire
civilized world for about two thou
sand years.
In this entire period, including
the first sixteen hundred years of
the Christian Era, the few men
whose names have come down to us
in connection with important dis
coveries in physical science were in
| variably the men who undertook;
} the study of nature by the experi-
J mental method. This was a period
I of the greatest possible activity in
philosophical and theological con
troversy, and yet it was in these
very subjects that the human race
seems to have made the least im
provement during the greater part
of that time. On the other hand,
every serious attempt at scientific
investigation by the experimental
method seems to have led to an in
crease of our knowledge of natural
phenomena.
The great modern awakening of
scientific investigation may be said
to date back to the year 100(3, and
can be attributed largely to the
work of Gilbert in England and
Galileo in Italy. In that year
William Gilbert published his great
work on Magnetism and Electricity,
in which lie not only taught, but
successfully illustrated, the only
method of scientific research which
litis ever led to definite results.
The scientific work of Gilbert is
not only important in that he was
the first experimental investigator
of magnetic phenomena, and that
he discovered much more about
magnetism than all those who had
preceded him, but because he dis
covered nearly all about magnetism
that the world yet knows, and be
cause his theory of a magnetic field,
after being disregarded for nearly
three hundred years, has, in a mod
ified form, come into general ac
ceptance within the last twenty
years. It would seem that a method
of scientific research which in the
hands of a single investigator could
accomplish so much must have in
it something of value to the world,
and it was of great importance to
succeeding investigators that Gil
bert explained his method so
clearly.
Gilbert recognized the fact that
he was dealing with a new manner
of investigation, and that his meth
ods would be subjected to unfavor
able criticism by the philosophers
of his day. In the opening para
graph of his preface he says:
"Since in the discovery of secret
things and in the investigation of j
hidden causes, stronger reasons art*
obtained from sure experiments
and demonstrated arguments than

| from probable conjectures and the
; opinions of philosophical specu
lators of the common sort; there
fore to the end that the noble sub
stance of that great loadstone, our
common mother (the earth), still
quite unknown, and also the forces
extraordinary and exalted of this
globe may the better be understood,
we have decided first to begin with
the common stony and ferruginous
matter, magnetic bodies, and
the parts of the earth that we may
handle and may perceive with the
senses ; then to proceed with plain
magnetic experiments and to pene
trate to the inner parts of the
earth."
In another place he says:"This
natural philosophy is almost a new
thing, unheard of before ; a very
few writers have simply published
some meager accounts of certain
magnetic forces. Therefore we do
not at all quote the ancients and
the Greeks as our supporters, for
neither can paltry Greek argumen
tation demonstrate the truth more
subtly nor Greek terms more ef
fectively, nor can both elucidate it
better. Our doctrine of the load
stone is contradictory of most of
the principles and axioms of the
Greeks."
In his defense for offering this
new method of research to the
world he says: "To you alone,
true philosophers, ingenuous minds,
who not only in books but in things
themselves look for knowledge,
have I dedicated these foundations
of magnetic science—a new style of
philosophizing. But if any see fit
not to agree with the opinions here
expressed and not to accept certain
of my paradoxes; still let them
note the great multitude of experi
ments and discoveries—these it is
chiefly that cause all philosophy to
flourish ; and we have dug them up
and demonstrated them with much
pains and sleepless nights and
great money expense. Enjoy them
you, and, if ye can, employ them
for better purposes."
I have referred especially to Gil
bert's great work because, to the
English speaking race, he is the
father of experimental science. At
the time when his work was pub
lished, however, Galileo, though at
the beginning of his career, had
already made his memorable ex
periments on falling bodies, and
was lecturing in the University of
Padua and laying the foundation
of the science of mechanics. For
the first time in the history of the
world two great experimental scien
tists were living and working at the
same time, and to their combined
influence we are largely indebted
for the rapid development of the
experimental method in science
which has since followed.
The method of scientific investi
gation to which our century owes
its wonderful progress is the method
of Gilbert and Galileo, and has
never been more clearly stated nor
mo-e successfully exemplified than
by these two men. It consists :
First —In collecting carefully au
thenticated facts as the basis of all
generalization.
Second—ln looking for some
common causal relation between
these facts, which relation is stated
in the form of a general proposi
