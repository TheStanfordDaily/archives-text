# "THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND ITS LIMITATIONS."
## The 						Commencement Address Delivered by Professor Fernando Sanford. 
### 
The century which is just clos
ing will probably always be re
membered as a period of re
markable scientific advancement.
This does not imply that
there have not been remark
able advancements made in other
lines of human activity. Probably
in no century has there been such
general and substantial progress in
all lines of intellectual activity as
in the one whose closing year is
about to dawn upon us. Much of
this activity has been due to the
scientific character of the age; much
has been in spite of it Certainly,
at no time in the world's history
has the general level of literary and
musical and artist ic culture been so
high as at the present time, and
the unprejudiced observer will not
assuredly attribute this high level
of attainment to the scientific char
acter of the age.
Hut it is also true that not in let
erary, artistic, nor even philosoph
ical lines has the best work of pre
vious centuries been surpassed,
while in every line of proper scien
tific investigation the knowledge
and doctrines of previous centuries
have become antiquated. Scarcely
a scientific theory held today is as
old as the century, and the great
generalizations upon which all nat
ural and physical science are now
based date back barely fifty years.
It is certainly well within the truth
to say that the human race has
made greater scientific progress in
our century than in the whole pre
vious period of its existence upon
the earth.
The cause of this remarkable
progress must be sought principally
in the scientific method of our age;
for while experimental science was
born about three hundred years
ago, it has only reached its mature
growth during the present century.
A brief comparison of modern ex
perimental science with the older
natural philosophy of Aristotle and
the middle ages will help make
plain the reasons for the relatively
great success of the modern meth
ods.
Hefore attempting any compari
son of their method with ours, it is
but proper that we should acknowl
edge the great debt which modern
science owes to the Greeks. Not
that their scientific knowledge was
greatly superior to that of the
rest of the world, for it
was not; but it has been said
of the (ireeks that they only,
of all the nations of antiquity, seem
to have sought fora knowable re
lation between natural phenomena.
They, alone, seem to have recog
nized that the phenomena of nature
bear a causal relation to each other,
and without a recognition of this
relation no science would be pos
sible. For science is not mere
catalogued knowledge of observed
facts. Such k now ledge must form the
groundwork upon which any true
science is built; but a knowledge of
the causal relations between the
observed facts and phenomena is j
theessential aim of all scientific in
vestigation. In all ancient nations

except the Greeks the speculations
concerning nature were of a mystic
or a religious character. Super
natural and spiritual powers were
supposed to be the causes of phys
ical phenomena, and even the
Greek natural philosophy isstrong
ly colored with these oriental su
perstitions.
Hut though the Greeks sought
for causal relations between natural
phenomena, they did not succeed
in finding a sure method of discov
ering these relations. It is true
that we are often told that all the
great generalizations of modern sci
ence were anticipated atone time or
another by Greek philosophers, but
these so-called anticipations were
nothing more than guesses, and had
no scientific value whatever. 'J he
only authority upon which any of
them rested was the philosophical
reputation of their authors, and
scientific laws are not based upon
human opinions.
The method of the Grecian nat
ural philosophy, in so far as the
scientific speculations of the phil
osophers can be characterized by
one who is compelled to rely upon
the opinions of others for most of
his idea* of (ireek science as well
as Grecian philosophy, was essen
tially the method of debate or ar
gument, which is so often mistaken
for the method of investigation,
even at the present time. It con
sisted in stating a general proposi
tion, and then, by means of logic,
in drawing all possible legitimate
conclusions from it. If the conclu
sions were not found to be contra
dictory to known facts, the general
proposition was regarded as estab
lished. Later, as methods of math
ematical analysis were developed,
these were used to assist in making
deductions from general laws—the
method still used in mathematical
physics.
In the use of the method of log
ical argument, no people have ever
surpassed, if any have ever equalled,
the ancient Greeks, and the reason
why they made almost no progress
in physical science is evidently be
cause the logical method alone is
not capable of discovering scientific
truth. The modern scientist still
uses the logical method, and as ex
pressed in the form of mathematical
analysis it is a very important in
strument of modern scientific in
vestigation, but the great achieve
ments of modern science are due to
the fact that man has learned to
arbitrarily interfere with natural
phenomena for the purpose of col
lecting and verifying the facts of
nature and of discovering their re
lations to each other. The method
of physical experimentation separ
ates the old science from the new.
When man first began to bring
about physical changes under vary-j
ing conditions, so that be might es
timate the influence of the different
elements of a phenomenon upon
the result, modern science had a j
beginning.
In this modern definition of the
term, Archimedes of Syracuse is;
generally regarded as the first
physical scientist. The (Jreeks were
philosophers, the Alexandrians were
mathematicians, but Archimedes
was an engineer and a physicist.
He united with iiis knowledge ol

the Greek philosophy and the
Egyptian mathematics the practice
of testing his conclusions by ex
i periment, and he accordingly made
i more scientific discoveries and more
mechanical inventions than almost
' all his predecessors combined.
| Hut the world was slow to take
| advantage of the method used with
| such wonderful success by Archi
| medes. Now and then a single in-
I vestigator would undertake to bring
j physical experimentation to the
I aid of his natural philosophy, and
invariably with startling results in
the way of discovery; but the nat
ural philosophy of Aristotle fur
nished the principal method of ac
quiring knowledge in the entire
civilized world for about two thou
sand years.
In this entire period, including
the first sixteen hundred years of
the Christian Era, the few men
whose names have come down to us
in connection with important dis
coveries in physical science were in
| variably the men who undertook;
} the study of nature by the experi-
J mental method. This was a period
I of the greatest possible activity in
philosophical and theological con
troversy, and yet it was in these
very subjects that the human race
seems to have made the least im
provement during the greater part
of that time. On the other hand,
every serious attempt at scientific
investigation by the experimental
method seems to have led to an in
crease of our knowledge of natural
phenomena.
The great modern awakening of
scientific investigation may be said
to date back to the year 100(3, and
can be attributed largely to the
work of Gilbert in England and
Galileo in Italy. In that year
William Gilbert published his great
work on Magnetism and Electricity,
in which lie not only taught, but
successfully illustrated, the only
method of scientific research which
litis ever led to definite results.
The scientific work of Gilbert is
not only important in that he was
the first experimental investigator
of magnetic phenomena, and that
he discovered much more about
magnetism than all those who had
preceded him, but because he dis
covered nearly all about magnetism
that the world yet knows, and be
cause his theory of a magnetic field,
after being disregarded for nearly
three hundred years, has, in a mod
ified form, come into general ac
ceptance within the last twenty
years. It would seem that a method
of scientific research which in the
hands of a single investigator could
accomplish so much must have in
it something of value to the world,
and it was of great importance to
succeeding investigators that Gil
bert explained his method so
clearly.
Gilbert recognized the fact that
he was dealing with a new manner
of investigation, and that his meth
ods would be subjected to unfavor
able criticism by the philosophers
of his day. In the opening para
graph of his preface he says:
"Since in the discovery of secret
things and in the investigation of j
hidden causes, stronger reasons art*
obtained from sure experiments
and demonstrated arguments than

| from probable conjectures and the
; opinions of philosophical specu
lators of the common sort; there
fore to the end that the noble sub
stance of that great loadstone, our
common mother (the earth), still
quite unknown, and also the forces
extraordinary and exalted of this
globe may the better be understood,
we have decided first to begin with
the common stony and ferruginous
matter, magnetic bodies, and
the parts of the earth that we may
handle and may perceive with the
senses ; then to proceed with plain
magnetic experiments and to pene
trate to the inner parts of the
earth."
In another place he says:"This
natural philosophy is almost a new
thing, unheard of before ; a very
few writers have simply published
some meager accounts of certain
magnetic forces. Therefore we do
not at all quote the ancients and
the Greeks as our supporters, for
neither can paltry Greek argumen
tation demonstrate the truth more
subtly nor Greek terms more ef
fectively, nor can both elucidate it
better. Our doctrine of the load
stone is contradictory of most of
the principles and axioms of the
Greeks."
In his defense for offering this
new method of research to the
world he says: "To you alone,
true philosophers, ingenuous minds,
who not only in books but in things
themselves look for knowledge,
have I dedicated these foundations
of magnetic science—a new style of
philosophizing. But if any see fit
not to agree with the opinions here
expressed and not to accept certain
of my paradoxes; still let them
note the great multitude of experi
ments and discoveries—these it is
chiefly that cause all philosophy to
flourish ; and we have dug them up
and demonstrated them with much
pains and sleepless nights and
great money expense. Enjoy them
you, and, if ye can, employ them
for better purposes."
I have referred especially to Gil
bert's great work because, to the
English speaking race, he is the
father of experimental science. At
the time when his work was pub
lished, however, Galileo, though at
the beginning of his career, had
already made his memorable ex
periments on falling bodies, and
was lecturing in the University of
Padua and laying the foundation
of the science of mechanics. For
the first time in the history of the
world two great experimental scien
tists were living and working at the
same time, and to their combined
influence we are largely indebted
for the rapid development of the
experimental method in science
which has since followed.
The method of scientific investi
gation to which our century owes
its wonderful progress is the method
of Gilbert and Galileo, and has
never been more clearly stated nor
mo-e successfully exemplified than
by these two men. It consists :
First —In collecting carefully au
thenticated facts as the basis of all
generalization.
Second—ln looking for some
common causal relation between
these facts, which relation is stated
in the form of a general proposi
tion, or a so-called law of nature-
Third — I it deducing by the
methods of both formal logic and
mathematical conclusions concern
ing other phemonena which have
not yet been observed ; and
Fourth —In experimenting to see
if these conclusions are correct.
In the first and last steps only
does experimental science differ
from the old natural philosophy.
The generalizations of the philos
ophers were as legitimate from the
data upon which they were based
as are any of our own. Their log
ical accuracy has never been sur
passed. But the supposed facts
upon which their generalizations
were based were not cirefully col
lected and authenticated, and either
were not facts at all, or were true
on ly under special conditions which
were not understood. Even the
simplest phenomena of nature are
so obscured by other phenomena
which frequently occur along with
them that without some artificial
method of separating them we can
not tell which relations are casual
and which are merely accidental.
It is the artificial separation of
phenomena in the laboratory that
has made the generalizations of the
scientist more valid than those of
the philosopher.
The fourth step, viz., the testing
of the final deductions by artificial
means, was also unknown to tin
natural philosophers, and without
this final step science could have
made little advancement. Nearly
all the generalizations of science
which have yet been made, no mat
ter how carefully the data have
been collected, have had to be
abandoned when the legitimate de
ductions from them have been sub
jected to the test of experiment.
Only a few of the millions of such
generalizations which have been
attempted are now accepted. The
reason for this is plain. Induction
can, at the best, only consider a
few of the many possible instances
which are included under the gen
eral law. If from these few a gen
eralization has been made which
will still hold when all the in
cluded instances are known, it may
almost be regarded as a lucky ac
cident. even in men of the greatest
scientific insight. In fact, as Jevons
has said, "In all probability the
errors of the great mind exceed in
number those of the less vigorous
one. Fertility of imagination and
abundance of guesses at truth are
among the first requisites of dis
covery ; but the erroneous guesses
must be many times as numerous
as those which prove well founded."
It is this fact which makes the
fourth step in the modern scientific
method so important, and it is be
cause this test of experiment, can
not be applied in many of the fields
of human investigation that our
knowledge in those fields still re
mains so uncertian.
My justification for this some
what lengthy consideration of the
methods of modern physical and
natural science must be found
in the fact that many prominent
writers on educational topics seem
to still believe in the efficacy of the.
methods of the old natural philos
ophy for scientific discovery, while
others think they are employing
the methods of experimental science
in fields of research where, from I
the nature of the phenomena in-,
volved, experiment is impossible
The tendency to mix the results,
of scientific investiiration and n eta -1
physical speculation has always
existed among men trained especi
ally nlong lines of metaphysical
thinking. In the early part of the
present century the philosopher

Hegel lived and taught in Heidel
| berg and JieiJin, and through his
teaching and his published works
succeeded in building up a school
of philosophy which still has many
prominent adherents. The general
proposition of Hegel's philosophy
which especially concerns our sub
ject is his assumption that both the
spiritual and the physical universe
are the result of an act of thought
by a creative mind, identical, in at
least many respects, with the hu
man mind ; and that it is accord
ingly possible for the human mind,
without any experience whatever
of natural phenomena, to think
over again the thoughts of the
Creator, and hence by its own ac
tivity to rediscover those relations
between phenomena which we call
natural laws.
It was believed by many of the
educated men of the time that
Hegel did succeed to a large extent
in constructing a priori the leading
principles of ethics and theology,
but his system of nature deduced
from the same hypothesis was, ac
cording to Helmholtz, regarded by
the scientific investigators of the
period as absolutely insane. Hegel
realized that if his system of phil
osophy was to win final recognition
it must succeed in explaining the
phenomena of nature as well as of
mental and moral science, and he
made a vigorous attack upon the
scientific methods of Newton and
i his successors. This led to a bitter
controversy between the students
of science and the philosophers, and
caused many of the keenest scien
tific minds of the century to totallv
reject philosophy as a means of ac
quiring knowledge of any kind,
while many of the followers of
Hegel still regard scientific investi
gators as a class of narrow special
ists who fail to use the means of
fered by philosophy for advancing
their knowledge of the universe.
It will probably be admitted by
one who gives the" subject unpre
judiced consideration that the op
position between natural science
and the subjects classed under the
head of mental and moral science,
while it was greatly exaggerated by
the Hegelian controversy, still has
some foundation in the nature of
the phenomena under investigation
and the intellectual processes in
volved in the two groups of study.
Most of the phenomena involved in
the mental and moral sciences
are incapable of being artificially
isolated from the other phenomena
which invariably accompany them
in nature, hence the laboratory
method of study can not be ap
plied to them. In these fields of
investigation, where knowledge
often seems to us to be more impor
tant than in any other, and where
many of the dearest interests of life
are involved, we are still dependent
upon the old method of natural
philosophy, which has proved so
inadequate as a means of acquir
ing a knowledge of nature. It is
not to be wondered at that the ex
perimental scientist, who has been
compelled to abandon one theory
after another which has seemed to
him to be based upon as sure a
foili dation as the principles of the
metaphysician and theologian,
should become skeptical in regard
to these principles. Neither is it
strange that the student of ethics
and social phenomena, who is ac
eu-tomed to deal with subjects of
the most vital human interest,
should look upon the natural
sciences, concerned as they seem to
he with lifeless, indifferent matter
nnd unintelligent forces, as mere
utilitarian subjects, beneath the
consideration of one devoted to cul

ture and intellectual development.
In thus underrating other fields
of investigation than their own
both parties are alike open to the
charge of narrowness. It does not
necessarily follow that a method of
investigation which has utterly
failed to give exact knowledge of
physical nature may not give more
reliable knowledge when the phe
nomena under investigation are the
actions of the human mind. It is
not a priori impossible that an accu
rate knowledge of the human mind,
if such knowledge can be had apart
from a knowledge of physical phe
nomena, may enable one to recog
nize the pi inciples of those sciences
whose phenomena are the activities
of the human mind. Whether or
not such an achievement be pos
sible, no one who does not believe in
the absolute identity of mental and
physical phenomena can derive any
argument for the employment of
the philosophical method in natural
science from its supposed success
ful use in the mental and moral
sciences.
But the tendency to depreciate
the methods of experimental science
which was so strong in the follow
ers of Hegel is now quite insignifi
cant, while, on the other hand, tin
investigators in nearly all lines oi
intellectual activity have learned
to use the language and to adopt
the name of the scientific method.
That there may be no misunder
standing of what scientific method
they claim to have adopted, we are
told by those who wish to appear
especially progressive that history,
sociology, philology, and even ele
mentary Latin are now studied by
the '"laboratory method."
This, to the worker in experi
mental science, is a mere confusion
of terms that ought to be kept dis
tinct. Neither the historian nor
the philologist nor the sociologist
can have anything corresponding
to the scientific laboratory. A labor
atory, in the scientific sense, is a
place devoted exclusively to the
study of phenomena. It is not a
library nor a museum. Does the
historian have some place where he
can bring about artificial changes
in government or study armies
upon the field of action? Does the
philologist bring the nations of an
tiquity before him where he can
produce artificial changes in their
environment or artificial inter
mingling of races, that he may note
the modifications made in language
liy these changes? Unfortunately,
they do not. Both are limited
to the study of the records
of the past as preserved in
libraries and museums. The
scientist also uses libraries and
museums, and lie uses them for ex
actly the same purpose as do other
scholars. He may sometimes even
use the historical method of study
ing physics or chemistry, but
when he wishes to verify the state
ments which he reads, he has re
course, not to other manuscripts of
the period, but to his laboratory.
Much of this cant about scientific
method in other subjects comes
from the attempts which are being
continually made to apply the laws
of the physical universe to phe
noniena which are usually classed
as men I a I or spiritua 1 Exaggera ted
examples of this tendency are found
in such books as ''Natural Law in
the Spiritual World." In writings
of this class the terms of experi-1
mental science are used with a
meaning wholly foreign to their
scientific use. \Ve hear much today
about the study of human society:
as an ''organism," that is, a living
individual, and the logical inference
is that the methods of botanv and

zoology, which have been used with
some success in the study of living
| organisms, are in the same way ap
plicable to the study of society.
From a recent article on "How
to study History" in a lead
ing educational journal I quote
the following statement of this
generalization: "The laws of
thought force us to the conclusion
that man, as the totality of individ
uals, is by nature one and undi
vided. One mighty, composite per
sonality who differentiates himself
into men that he may better help
himself: an organism whose multi
form members appear as men. And
just as in any organism, the exis
tence of each member is condi
tioned by the existence of the whole,
so the existence of each man de
pends upon the existence of all
other men."
A little farther along in the same
article 1 read: "The individual is
the specific aspect, tone, color, in
which God would see the divine
life; he isthe utterance of God him
self at a given point of time and
space. Hence individuality has
the very sacredness of God, and to
unford it is the final cause of our
existence." Evidently the author
has failed to consider the result
upon this mighty, composite organ
ism when each of his hundreds of
millions of members begins to un
told its sacred individuality.
The distinction between such sci
ences as sociology and ethics and
the sciences which are classed as
natural or physical has been fur
ther emphasized by the scientific
investigation of our century. To
make this clear it will be necessary
for me to give a somewhat technical
discussion of some of the changes
whioh have taken place in our con
ception of the physical universe
(luring the last hundred years.
Three hundred years ago Galileo
I investigated with great success the
laws of motion of material bodies,
and half a century later these laws
were stated by Newton in the same
form in which they are taught
today. Galileo first assumed the
existence of forces as the cause of
acceleration. Gilbert supposed one
magnet or electric charge to act
upon another magnet or charge by
means of some kind of invisible
medium existing between them; but
Galileo and,his successors assumed
that bodies may act directly upon
each other without the intervention
of any substance whatever, and
Lord Kelvin tells us that before
the end of the eighteenth century
this idea of action at a distance
through absolute vacuum had be
come so firmly established that the
not'on of the propagation of electric
or magnetic action by means of an
intervening medium seemed utterly
wild, even to scientific intestiga
tors.
The legitimate result of this doc
trine of forces was the assumption
that every particle in the universe
was acted upon by numberless
forces. If the particle remained at
rest, it was because these forces bal
anced each other. If one force came
to overbalance its opponents, the
body moved. A body once in mo
tion could only be brought to rest
by a force acting in a direction op
posite to the motion of the body.
Thusall the phenomena of physical
nature resulted from the warfare of
an infinite number of forces.
These forces, themselves, were in
capable of any further physical ex
planation, since they were utterly
independent of mechanism of any
kind. An attractive or repulsive
force could act between bodies when
there was nothing whatever be
tween them. Manifestly, the only
explanation fora force of this kind
must be a metaphysical explana
tion, and the phenomena of the
physical universe were apparently
due to influences not of themselves
physical.
Then,since the phenomena of na
ture are of many different kinds,
they must result from many differ
ent kinds of forces. Tims the ex
istence of the human body was con
ditioned upon the equilibrium be
tween the vital forces, which were
regarded as different from mere
physical forces, and the forces of
decay, which were chemical forces.
The movements of the body were
regarded as the overbalancing of
physical forces by mental or spiri
tual forces. This ied to the notion
of certain superior grades of force,
as spiritual or mental, capable
when properly exerted of overmas
tering ordinary physical forces, and
the probability of any phenomenon
in the physical universe being the
result of physical forces became
very remote. A physical phenom
enon might be due either to phys
ical, vital, or spiritual forces, or it
might result at one time from one
kind of force and at another time
from another kind. In other words,
there was no certainty <>112 uniform
ity in natural phenomena, and an
impossibility of telling what par
ticular force had been efficient in
producing a given phenomenon.
But all of this notion of forces as
the cause o( phenomena has been
changed by the physics of the pres
ent century. One hundred and one
years ago, Benjamin Thompson,
Count liumford, performed his
memorable experiment on the gen
eration of heat by friction, in which
he showed that the quantity of heat
produced was proportional to the
work expended in its production.
The following year, Humphrey
Davv succeeded in melting ice by
friction in a vacuum at a tempera
ture lower than the freezing point.
Previous to this time heat had been
regarded as an imponderable fluid
which could pass from one body to
another at a lower temperature;
but these experiments showed that
an indefinite quantity of heat could
be obtained from bodies at a low
temperature without in any way
lowering their capacity for giving
off more beat, liumford and Davy
both conclude that the causeofheat
is motion and that to heat a body
is merely to set in mo i >n the ulti
mate particles of the body.
But if this were true, the heat pro
duced should be proportional to the
quantity of motion expended in its
production, and this was found not
to be the case. The quantity of
motion of a body had, since New
ton's time, been measured by the
product of its mass into its velocity.
Measured in this way, its heating
effect bore no relation to its quan
tity of motion. Evidently, heat
could not be a mere mode of mo
tion.
It took fifty years of investiga
tion by the physicists of the entire
world to find the relation between
the heating capacity of a moving
body and its mass and velocity.
Carnot, in France, writing about
1830, says: "Heat is simply motive
power, or rather motion which has
changed form. . . . Where
ever there is a destruction of motive
power, there is at the same time a
production of heat exactly propor
tional to the quantity of motive
power destroyed. Reciprocally,
whenever there is a destruction of
heat, there is production of motive
power We can then establish the
general proposition that motive
power is in quantity invariable in
nature —that is, correctly speaking,

never either produced or destroyed."
| This is the lirst statement of the
greatest generalization of physics,
lint Carnot failed to show how to
measure motive i)ovver so that it
! should always he proportional to
the heat expended in its produc
tion, and his generalization was
not placed upon a thoroughly satis
factory theoretical hasis until the
j great work of Hehnholtz in 1847,
j and its complete experimental ver
ification by Joule was not finished
until two years later, just fifty
years ago. Then the word energy
came to he used for motive power,
and the generalization of Carnot
and Helmholtz came to he known
as the Doctrine of the Conservation
of Energy.
The establishment of this theory
is undoubtedly the greatest achieve
ment of physical science up to the
present time, it necessarily led to
an entirely new conception of the
physical universe. If this doctrine
of the conservation of energy was
to he accepted, no such tiling
as a force of any kind
would be left in that part fo
the universe properly called phys
ical. In place of all the conflicting
forces of the earlier physics, there
would he left merely a definite
quantity of energy, something as
indestructible as matter, and with
matter making up the sum total of
the materials of which the physical
universe is composed. A physical
change merely involves a redistri
bution of the energy in that part
of the physical universe in which
the change takes place. Some mass,
or molecule, or atom gives up its
energy to some other mass, or mole
cule, or atom, and that is all. The
quantity of matter, as we measure
matter, is not changed. The quan
tity of energy, measured by its ca
pacity for doing work, is not
changed. What we previously
called the force acting between the
different parts of matter is merely
the measure of the rate at which
the energy is being transferred from
the one to the other.
Thus, instead of a heterogeneous
universe, made up of many differ
ent kinds of matter and innumer
able forces, we have come to believe
in a physical universe in which
only matter and energy exist.
Every change in the physical uni
verse follows the same law as any
other change. The " uniformity "
<>112 physical nature is established.
Our definition of natural law is
also influenced by this conception
of the universe. A natural law, in
the physical universe, can mean
nothing more than an observed or
der of events. It is a natural law
that bodies unsupported fall to the
earth ; that a cold body may ac
quire heat from a warmer body, and
t he like. That is, these transforma
tions or transferences of energy
which are associated with physical
phenomena always take place in a
definite way. The physical changes
are always in a definite direction.
There are no reversible processes in
nature. The physical universe it
self is apparently not a, reversible
phenomenon. It came from a con
dition essentially different from the
present. It is passing into a con
dition essentially different from the
; present. It is but a phase of some
immensely greater system.
And it is not only the physical
sciences which have been revolu
tionized by the doctrine of the con
servation of energy, but the sciences
of life as well. Hardly had the
uniformity of natural processes
been established for phvsics and
chemistry when it was recognized
in geology and biology. The geol
ogy of cataclysms and special crea

tions gave way to the geology of
slow, continuous changes. The
doctrine of special creation of
species gave place to the theory of
evolution of organic forms from
older and simpler forms, llelm
holtz's Erhaltung der Kraft was
followed in only twelve years by
Darwin's Origin of Species.
The influence of this work upon
the thought of the world has cer
tainly not been equalled by that
of any other book of the century.
Professor Jackman, in a recent
number of the Educational Review,
truly says : " The dominating in
fluence in the world's thought at
the present time is ttie doctrine of
evolution. Beginning its conquest
but a generation ago with what
seemed to be chiefly the question ot
man's physical or corporeal rela
tionships, it has penetrated little
by little his intellectual and moral
domains so completely that today
i here is not a phase of thought or
i human activity that has not been
stimulated and vivified by this great
est of all human conceptions. With
the advent of this idea, chaos and
chance went out and the reign of
order and universal law was usher
ed in."
Hut the doctrine of evolution rep
resents an attempt on the part of
the biologist to include the phe
nomena of life under the generali
zation of physics. If the origin 01
life, as well as the origin of species,
be included in the doctrine, then is
it asserted that all the phenomena
of life are physical phenomena,
that is, that they result from phys
ical changes alone, and physiology
becomes merely the application of
the laws of physics and chemistry
to a special class of phenom
ena.
In this sense we must remember
that the theory of evolution lacks
the experimental evidence of the
doctrine of the conservation of en
ergy in the physical world. While
it is known that most, if not all,
physiological processes are accom
panied by a transformation and re
distribution of energy, it is not yet
possible to measure the quantities
of energy transformed in the dif
ferent operations and to show a
definite proportionality between
the energy transformed and the re
sults accomplished Likewise, we
know of no case where any organi
zation of matter and energy has
resulted in the generation of life dc
novo. The living being takes en
ergy from other parts of the phys
ical universe and transforms it into
the energy of muscular contraction
and returns it again to the physical
universe in the form of work ac
complished or of heat given off ;
but the power to do this is always,
in our experience, acquired from
another living being. There is n<»
experimental proof of the origin of
life by means of evolution.
Hut it is not only in those de
partments of science where the uni
formity of natural law would seem
to be a legitimate deduction that
the scientific method has found
favor with investigators, for at the
present time many of the writers
on ethics and sociology and theol
ogy are attempting to apply the
methods and the laws of physical
science in their fields of investiga
tion. It is noticeable, however,
that it is not the new physics of
energy, but the old physics of
forces, which is beinir thus applied
The physics which has been ren
dered obsolete by the investigation
of the century has been taken up by
the sociologist, and we have this
mighty organism, man, still strug
gling with as tun y forces as were
formerly supposed to batt!: for :he

control of the physical bodies of his
individual members.
It is here, if I may be allowed to
prophesy, that the intellectual bat
tles of the first half of the coming
century will be fought. When the
doctrine of the evolution of organic
life was first proposed it was bit
terly opposed by philosophers and
theologians who thought they saw
in it an attempt to enlarge the do
mains of the physical universe so
as to include all the phenomena
which had heretofore been regarded
as mental or spiritual. Finally,
when the battle had been won by
evolution, it was seen that the ques
tion was not whether there are both
a spiritual and a physical universe,
but whether the special phenomena
of animal lite should be claseed as
spiritual or physical. But the
question raised by the attempts to
apply the laws of physics to ethics
and sociology is an entirely differ
ent one. If there is any spiritual
universe, the phenomena of ethics
are spiritual phenomena. The as
sumption of natural law, that is,
physical law, in the spiritual uni
verse means that there is no spir
itual universe. A universe gov
erned by the laws of physics is a
universe in which there is no right
or wrong, justice or injustice, re
ward or punishment ; nothing but
inevitable consequences. A physi
cal universe is one in which no
force or influence whatever exists,
nothing but the unvarying trans
formation of energy, always in one
direction and according to definite
methods ; for if a singie atom in
the universe can be moved by any
force whatever, either mental,
moral or spiritual, except by the
transference of energy from some
other atom, then is it not a physi
cal universe.
If the physics of the present cen
tury has established anything, it is
that the physical world is made up
of matter and energy alone. If
the laws of the physical universe
apply to sociology and ethics, it is
reasonable to suppose that only
matter and energy are involved in
the phenomena treated in these
sciences, if, on the other hand,
the development of society and the
development of human character
are dependent upon spiritual influ
ences, there is manifestly no proba
bility that the processes which take
place as a result of these influences
will bear any analogy to physical
phenomena. If such an analogy
be shown to exist, it will serve as an
argument against the supposition
of spiritual influences.
Whether such an analogy reallv
exists or not is not a question for
the physicist to decide. This ques
tion can only be determined by the
careful observation of many men
who are trained to observe and to
analyze social phenomena, and who
are at the same time familiar with
the laws of the physical universe.
This much, at least, is certain : if
there is not a uniformity of nature
in social phenomena so that effects
follow causes with the same cer
tainty as they do in the physical
universe, then is there no science of
sociology, and no such thing as a
moral or social law. In so far as
man is a free, moral agent, capable
of determining his own conduct,
all attempts at predicting what he
will do under given circumstances
must fail. Only in so far as man is
<jnverneil, not merely influenced, by
laws as unalterable and unvarying
as are the laws of the physical uni
verse, can his actions furnish the
materials of scientific 1 study. If,
on the oilier hand, there are such
laws, ihen all attempts of man at
