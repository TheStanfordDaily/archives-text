# Stanford Farm.
## 
### 
To the air of " Mandalay.''''
At the Quad near Palo Alto, looking eastward to the bay,
Where the red-roofed towers are standing, and the bamboos nod and
sway ;
Where the breezes in the palm trees answer to the bell's alarm :
"Come you back, you Stanford laddies; come you back to Stanford
Farm !''
Come y< u back to Stanford Farm,
Where the arches thrill and charm ;
Can't you hear those voices calling, calling from the Stanford Farm ?
Chorus —In the walks around the Quad,
Where the western breezes play,
There the students stroll and saunter, out at Stanford by the bay !
There are Seniors, staid and sober, wearing caps and gowns so fine,
And sombreros big and shady, which will do for rain or shine ;
There are Junior plugs fantastic, and the girls' red-lettered hats,
Then the jolly, lazy Soph'mores, sporting canes and talking frats.
Bashful Freshmen, green and raw,
Saying only " Oh 1" and ''Ah!''
All are calling you to join them, and to give the good obi " Rah !"
In the walks around the Quad, etc.
In the fall when days are sunny, and the football men come out,
Then the boys are full of vigor, and the bleachers often shout,
"What's the matter with 'diet' Murphy?" "'Chester Murphy is all
right ! "
Then they shout the " Rah, rah, Stanford 1" and they cheer with all
their might.
Up to Congress Springs they'll drive,
Ami from morn till night they'll strive
For the victory they must win us, when Thanksgiving days arrive.
In the walks around the Quad, etc.
But those days are all behind me —long ago and far away,
And there are no 'buses running to the Quad for me today ;
And I'm learning here in 'Frisco what the P. (i. often tells:
"If you've heard the Quad a-calling, you will care for nothing else."
No, you'll care for nothing else,
But those spicy jasmine smells,
And the sunshine, and the bamboos, and the ringing of the bells,
In the walks around the Quad, etc.
Ship me back to Palo Alio, to the place for which I long.
To the land of golf and football, to the home ol sport and song.
For the voices there are calling, and it's there that I would be;
For the dear old Quad at Stanford is the only place for me.
On the path where palm tnes urow,
To the yellow arches low,
Thro' the arboretum wheeling with a pretty girl I know!
In the walks around the Quad,
Where the western breezes play,
r £here the students stroll and saunter, out at Stanford by the bay 1
