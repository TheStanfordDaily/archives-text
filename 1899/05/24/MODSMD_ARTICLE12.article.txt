# Faculty-Senior Baseball.
## 
### 
On ►Saturday morning the Fac
ulty defeated the Seniors by the
ecu re of 12 to 11.
The game was sensational in
every department, from the cos
tume and errors of the Seniors to
the batting of the Faculty in the
fourth inning and of Dr. Jordan
every time he got a chance.
The game was scheduled for
10:80 a.m., and shortly after that
time the '99 team was seen ap
proaching the diamond a scintill
ating mass of gorgeous color and
filmy gauze. The nine had adopt
ed the Lireek national costume or
a close adaptation of it as their
uniform. The uniformity con
sisted principally in the fiesh
tights of delicate pink which each
man wore. In the rest of the cos
tume a wide divergence of taste
was displayed in the choice of
c dor, although the same general
style of cut and tit was noticeable
in the attire of all. Evidently no
little attention had been bestowed
upon the selection of a proper hue,
some being chosen to match com
plexion or hair, and others to har
monize with tne wearer's more
subtle characteristics of mind or
temperament. The Seniors fur
nished not only a picturesque but
even an imposing spectacle as they
came upon the diamond — more
imposing if less picturesque than
when lliey left.
For the first few innings they
played good baseball and the Fac
ulty team seemed to be as hope
lessly outclassed as 'hey were
when '97 piled up a score ot 27 to
their half dozen or so. But in
the fourth inning their costumes
and coiffures had become some
what disarranged, and before they
had gotten themselves together
again the Faculty had been able to
get men around the three bases
and safe back home again ten times.
Then it was that most of the
Seniors discarded their pretty hats,
rubbed dirt on their hands and got
down to work. Hut they could not
make up for that one inning and
Dr. Jordan continued to come to
the bat and Billy Erb to run. The
Seniors played with determination,
but very little judgment or science,
and the final score was 12 toll
against them.
This is the first time since '94
that the Faculty have won. They
defeated '93 and '94. The players:
Faculty. Seniors.

The features of the game were,
beside the Seniors'appearance, Ilea
Smith's home run in the first
inning, some pretty double plays,
mostly by the Faculty, and Dr.
Jordan's game.
His form at first has noticeably
improved since the last two years
and he played an almost errorless
game. At the bat he was always
sure of a. hit and he placed his hits
effectively. When seen after the
game he exhibited the modesty of a
really great player. "It takes a
good many years to make a good
baseball player," he said. " 1 have
been playing at this, my favorite of
all athletic sports, since the game
was invented. 1 first began to play

in 186- r ) and have played a little
every year since."
The lack of experience was pain
fully evident on the part of some
j members of the '99 nine and no
