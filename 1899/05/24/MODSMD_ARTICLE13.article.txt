# CLASS DAY EXERCISES.
## An Account of the Various Events of the Day with the Addresses. 
### 
The Class Day exercises, held in
the chapel, began promptly at hall
past ten on Monday morning. Al
most every hour on Monday car
ried with it some part ot the Class
Day festivities, but at no moment
from President Arnold's opening
speech in the morning to the last
waltz at the ball at night, did any
thing tend to break a lull round of
enjoyment.
The chapel was crowded with a
most appreciative audience, when
President Arnold delivered the ad
dress of welcome:
Friendtt and Fellow Students : —
It is my privilege and pleasure as
a representative of the Class of '99
to welcome you here this morning.
We are going to graduate, and we
want you to help us celebrate the
event this week. Although we are
few in number, no one will deny
that we are the Hnest class for our
size that has ever graduated from
Stanford University. Our class
historian will prove this to you a
little later.
Surely the saying that "a bad
beginning brings a good ending"
has been proven true in our case.
We came here when the very exist
ence of the University was in
doubt; we have passed through all
of the trying uncertainties attend
ant upon such a condition ; and,
now, as a reward we are permitted
to witness the beginning of a new
epoch in the history of Stanford
University that will make its name
stand tor one of the world's great
est institutions of learning.
Upon our graduation we will be
come part of an Alumni that has
already made itself felt in the busy
world outside, and it is our ambi
tion to add our mite to this influ
ence that already extends to the
very outskirts of civilization.
To those of our fellow students
who have gone or. before us, we ex
tend our thanks for the many little
helps they gave us when we were
Freshmen, and to the Class of '98
especially do we owe much for
teaching 11s that noblest trait in
human character, forbearance. The
Class of 1900 has also done its
share to impress us that i( patience
is a virtue" when we are sur
rounded by the intricacies of this
lite as well as when we are tied up
with baling rope.
We congratulate those who follow
us on theever widening possibilities
offered them by our Alma Mater,
and we hope that they may be
as ready to take advantage of these
possibilities as were the members
of the pioneer classes.
To our professors and instructors
we owe a debt of gratitude that can
never be repaid. Our patient
teachers in the class room and
laboratory, our genial companions
and ever helpful friends in our so
cial life, they have left upon our
characters an everlasting influence.
The final tribute of the Class of
'99 we offer to her whose loving de
votion and thoughtful care has en
abled us to receive such a benefi
cent education. It was she who
took the silver lining from thedark
cloud of litigation that hung on us
at our entrance here, and with it
has made possible that magnificieni
building wherein will be enacted
the closing scene of our college
career. To her all thanks !
Ralph Filcher, Class Historian,
then give the account of the haps
and mishaps that '99 found in hei
Jour years of undergraduate lit'-,

working the thread of his story
through a humorous introduction
to an impressive ending.
History of the '99 Class.
When the '99 Class entered the
University, perceiving that alto
gether too much attention had heen
paid to athletics, she cast 11 bout her
for some other Held wherein to
work. The intellectual Held was
comparatively unfilled and into
this rushed : 99 with energy and zeal
As a consequence soon the staff
of editors of the Daily Palo Alto
was increased three-fold and event
ually four mem hers of the class
dictated its editorial policy.
In the second year Josh was
started with a '99 man at its head,
and the third year the class tried
its hand at making an Annual. As
to the result of the latter work let
posterity judge whether any class
will excel it in this line.
Debating was next essayed and
our record of two men on each of
the regular Intercollegiate teams
for 1898 and 1899 stands as a monu
ment to our forensic ability.
However, while we were making
strides in intellectual lines, ath
letics also prospered, fora few of.
our men had declined the honors
of the pen and the forum and given
their best muscle, as well as brain, to
the maintenance of our athletic
si andard.
Of the record which those men
who took up athletics have made
we believe the University is proud.
Several examples of the rarest
athletic genius do we prize. John
Brunton, track captain for 1898, was
easily the best short distance man
that Stanford has had. Lewis
Freeman is the only Stanford man
who has won Varsity sweaters for
football, baseball, track, and tennis.
Captain Fisher of this year's eleven
sent his men through a season of
the greatest discouragement with
energy and determination and
never despaired until time was
called at the last of the second
half. Track Captain Smith has
combined athletics with literary
work and won for us the intercol
legiate mile record.
Five star football players and
worthy representatives on the dia
mond. track, and tennis court, are
we proud to claim. In addition to
the records of the individual men,
as evidence of the activity which
'99 stands for in athletic lines, the
work which has been done toward
securing that much needed institu
tion, a training-house, stands
boldly in the front.
Not least among the things of
which '99 is proud is the fact that
with her will graduate some of the
most famous men of t he U ni versity —
men who, though through mistake
did enter college with other classes,
have since seen the error of their
way and allied themselves with '99.
For their good taste —or that of the
faculty —the highest compliment is
flue.
Passing from our achievements
in various lines of endeavor, it may
be said in general that the gradua
tion of '99 marks an epoch in the
history of this University —connect-
ing link that the class is between
the future and the memories and
traditions of the past.
With the graduation of '99 there
leave college the last of those men
who have known and appreciated
the spirit of the pioneer, whose ac
quaintance has been intimate with
the men who made the present un
dergraduate life of Stiii ford what
it is, developed its traditions, its
pleasures, and its college spirit.
Later classes must turn to us to
I pa r 11 the legrt (1- of the Un i versi I y's
< hildhood. f<>r we are the bridge be

tween the infancy and the man
hood of the institution.
With the magnificent buildings
finished and those in contempla
tion, the University will henceforth
rank among the best equipped in the
world. The next generation ofclasses
will pass by the new Library, the
new Chapel, and the new Assembly
Hall. They will see the University
in its expanded glory, and they
will never be aware of an intenser
life that once centered around the
•'Old Quad."
But we will be the only class
that has known both the intimate
fellowship of the old University
and the larger life of the new, for
Wednesday the buildings of the
new Quad will be used in the first
Commencement exercises, for those
of '99.
But in a far deeper sense are we
the bridge between the old and the
new. Every arch in the Quad has
a meaning to us that no other class
can ever-know. We entered Stan
ford during her darkest hour
Others who come after us and share
in the great tide of prosperity may
know the affection that comes from
so great bounty. But only those
who have felt the hopes and
through which the founders had to
struggle, can ever experience such
deep personal love for these revered
arches as is shared by the mem
bers of '99. 11. E Filcher.
Following the annual custom,
J. Frank English, on behalf of '01,
presented the sophomore cane, with
all its privileges, to the Class of '02,
with the admonition that it should
stand up for all Sophomore prece
dents, and see to it that 1903 be al
lowed to carry the cane only on the
gaining of second year standing.
Professor Murray spoke the last
words for the faculty to the out
going class. His address follows:
As a college year draws to its
close different thoughts come to dif
ferent individuals, but there is a
universal feeling of satisfaction that
the year's work is over and that the
tension mav be relaxed fora time.
For tension there is in the serious
work of the year, and although
many a one doubtless feels that he
might have accomplished more than
he has, yet the large majority can
look back upon a period of earnest
effort.
When, therefore, the last exami
nation is past a change comes over
a college community ; spirits are
higher, hearts are buoyant. Work
is done for the time being at least,
and small wonder that many take
the first train for home, leaving new
friends, it may be, with a touch of
regret, but glad to rejoin the old
friends ; small wonder too that
many whose homes are near and
who have not that reason for leav
ing, still take gun and fishing rod
and flee to the woods, and that those
who remain avoid all Commence
ment festivities —at least all those at
which they must listen to any talk
ing. Have they not spent the last
eight or ten months in going from
one room in the quadrangle to an
other to listen to talking and lectur
ing, when it may be they would far
rather be somewhere else ? But
now a respite has come. And yet
those of you who are to be grad
uated on Wednesday next still
linger. Some even of your number
have left, but most of you are still
here, and this is your day, the day
of the Class of '99 It is a day of
good feeling ; you have squared ac
counts with your instructors and
now your diplomas are as good as
yours. You meet here to celebrate,

to have a good time with a glance
at the future and a glance at the
past ; with a good-humored sense
of satisfaction and contentment,
and, perhaps, a playtul recognition
of one another's feelings. And on
this, your own day, yon have
chosen to give one of the faculty a
chance at you.
Happily circumstanees are all on
your side. We are all in good
humor, and if you are tired of hear
ing lectures, we are also tired ol
giving them. We don't feel like
multiplying words, but, most of all,
like giving a shake of the hand and
a God-bless-you and turning each
his own way.
And yet even in the humor of a
class-day prophecy with its good
natured satire, even in your last
jokes about men and things that
have been familiar through these
years, there is another vein, not of
out and out sadness, but a vein of
deeper feeling. You leave us now ;
yes, you can snap your fingers at
us if you feel like it; but that is
just the point. I honestly be
lieve you don't feel like it.
True there is now and then in var
ious places a recrudescence of the
puerile view that faculty and stu
dents make up hostile camps; true
the old conception of a hard and
fast dividing line between the two
is not absolutely dead in some quar
ters; true again that in any col
lege community some must teach
and others must listen; but despite
all this a saner, wholesoiner view
prevails with us. Our way of look
ing at such things, is that we have
been a body of good friends, work
iug together for common ends —
ends that are not for self alone, but
for one another. We have loved to
call this the Stanford spirit, hon
estly believing that it prevails here
more than in most, if not all of our
sister institutions; and we are jeal
ous of it. If on your part you have
seen —as I hope you have not —
any indications of a lessening of
this freedom of intercourse, of this
friendliness among the members of
our community, let it be a part of
your duty, as you join the ranks of
the alumni, to make your influence
tell against any such forces. This
is perhaps our strongest, our most
cherished tradition. And you can
do this the more easily inasmuch
as you cease now to be Stanford
students only to become in another
sense co-operators with us. Retain
your loyalty, retain and cherish
this healthful spirit that obtains
among us, and each year shall see
a strengthening of the ties that bind
us all together.
We lead busy lives here, intense
lives, but not warped or cramped
lives. The old scholastic ideal of a
quiet cell where the recluse could
withdraw from the world to pore
over musty tomes and wear his life
out in study, does not fit our large
view of life. We cherish all that
the past has learned of truth in
every line of human thought, and
we honor all who have added any
thing, however small, to the stock
of the world's knowledge; but in
our view this earnest, restless
search for truth goes hand in hand
with a recognition of the fact that
there are others about us striving
in their way to attain to the same
goal, and we like to put shoulder to
shoulder and work together.
Have you found much pedantry
here? much parade of learning?
Have you not rather found that
scholarship is put above learning,
and that one is tolerant of another,
not belittling his work but glad to
believe that the line ot work he has
chosen is the best for him ? This
is another manifestation ol the
same spirit, and this large tolerance
we cherish too. It prevents our
lives from being narrow, or from
seeming narrow to one another,
even when one may not be in a
position to appreciate another's
work. We credit one another with
being men and women with large
views and high ideals, men and
women to whom life is very real and
very rich—who touch what is liv
ing and what is vital in their work.
Now am I wrong in feeling that
you carry away these views with
you? I trust not, for these things
are worth holding fast. We who
remain cherish them, hold them to
be not only true, but the most strik
ing characteristics of our life here,
and in maintaining these things you
can help us. Few, if any, of you
sever absolutely your connection
with Stanford and her foster chil
dren; none of you, I am sure, go
forth without a loyal pride in our
University. As alumni and alumnae
you can aid in fostering these tilings
often more effectively than we can
do it ourselves. And to foster these
is to work against all tendencies you
may have seen in your college life
that make against this frank and
friendly and sympathetic spirit
which we hold to be ours. It mat
ters not where these things have
cropped out; it may have been in
college politics, it may have been
in social life shown by a tendency
toward snobbishness, it may have
been in fraternity life, or again in
athletics. Take the last as an in
stance; we are proud of our record —
not this year of our victories, al
though that matters but little, but
proud to think that our athletics
have in the main been exceptionally
clean. Here, if undergraduate zeal
runs beyond judgment, we need a
strong sentiment 011 the part of the
alumni. Neither you nor we want
any man brought here for athletics'
sake, because he will help us in
football or 011 the track, even if the
letter of the law governing college
athletics be not infringed in bring
ing him. We want more of sport
for sport's sake, and less of sport
for the sake of winning, and we
want every position 011 every team
to be open to any man in college
who shall prove himself the best
man, regardless of position or of
affiliations.
For we are a democracy, and re
joice in equal opportunities for all
equal opportunities in the classroom,
011 the field, and in social relations.
We believe in worth, and in worth
alone, and jealously guard as open
to all, all that our University life of
fers, holding that, in the long run,
worth prevails.
Now I have done. Pardon me
if 011 your own day I have imposed
011 your courtesv and nreached to
you once more Doubtless you feel
that of all this you have had enough
and more than enough; but take
this not as a parting shot, but as a
friendly word of farewell. You go
your separate ways, but you are
still ours. We claim your interest
and your help, desiring nothing so
much as that the things that char
acterize our life here be not things
that are petty and trivial, but things
that are true, honorable, and just,
pure, lovely, and of good report.
The last will and testament of the
class, which had been drawn up by
the leading legal lights of '99, was
read by Mr. Suzzallo:
To all to whom these presents may
come, In this wide and spacious
principality of Stanford University,
of the county of Santa Clara, and
the State of California, presided over
and governed by his most high and
maguificent mightiness, David Starr

Jordan, and his worthy co-dignitary
in domestic management, that re
nowned and undaunted knight,
Chas. Hrnest Schwartz.
We, the Class of' 99 of L. S. J. U.,
domiciled and situated in the afore
said domain, and of the age of 4
years more or less, being in full pos
session of the powers of maturity,
and of sound mind and disposing
memory, not acting under menace,
fraud, undue influence, corruption,
or intimidation whatsoever, but with
the consideration of brotherly love
and charity for all, and with malice
nor hard feeling toward none, do
make, concoct, publish, and declare
this to be our last will and testa
ment, in the manner hereinafter set
forth, to wit:

tion to discover, ascertain, and un
cover to the world, for the benefit
of science and mankind, the answers
to the following queries:
Why Encitia Hall is considered
the province and subject of special
and class legislation, applicable to
110 other dwelling or domicile 011 the
campus?
Why men are not chosen for the
Glee Club 011 account of their ability
to sing, rather than for ability to
pose?
Why that new "frat" has not an
nounced itself?
Why rival "frats" can not act in
harmony concerning the interests of
the University?
Why the Associated Students
paid $475 fora piano which is
worthless for student body purposes?
Why students who have never
interested themselves in athletics
wear the cardinal sweater with im
punity?
Why certain and honorable ser
vants are not relegated to the shelf?
Why the members of the Glee
Club were allowed to extend the time
of payment of their notes to Novem
ber next?
Secondly.—We give and bequeath
our time honored powers and pre
rogatives, together with all the
burdens and duties appurtenant and
incident to the use thereof, of what
ever kind and description, to that

we know it is, the Class of 1900, for
their own separate use during their
life. Provided and 011 condition that
if any member of the aforesaid bene
ficiary should see fit to enter hy

A. H Suzzallo.
After the close of the exercises in
the chapel, the audience immedi
ately assembled before the portico
of the new chapel, where the cere
monies attendant 011 the dedication
of the '99 bronze tablet were held.
C. S. Chandler, for '99, presented
the plate to the University, Dr. Jor
dan accepting it. These ceremon
ies were closed by the singing of
" Hail, Stanford, Hail ! "
We are assembled here today for
the purpose of adding one more
monument to Stanford University.
The custom of the Senior Class to
dedicate to the University a hronze
plate in the pavement of the ar
cades is now well established. And
these plates before us mark mile
stones in the history of Stanford.
The line is short; so is the history
of the University. Yet it has not
been without its dark side. There
was a period once, in which, beset
with doubt and uncertainty, it
seemed that the University must
fail. Yet in the face of this adver
sity, in the worst period of Stanford
history, when the doors were opened
fora new year, it was found that
307 young men and women had
confidence enough in Stanford to
entrust four years of the most crit
ical period of their lives to her
care.
No better tribute could be paid
to the University than to say that
such a number of students could be
found to enter at such a time. And
no better proof of the loyalty of the
Class of '99 to Stanford could be
had than the fact that it is composed
of those students.
Four years have passed since
then. In the meantime we have
seen our Alma Mater emerge from
the dark ages of its history. With
joy in our hearts we have seen it
enter upon a period of prosperity
and expansion. Though some of
us are opposed to expansion in its
latest signification, we unanimously
approve of it in this particular in
stance. We hope to see our Uni
versity mow and expand until its
influence sha'l become a factor, not
only in California, not only on the
Pacific Coast, not only in our own
country, but throughout the entire

world. We hope to see it become
largely instrumental in carrying
enlightenment and civilization to
the Far East, and to the Southern
Continent of America. And further
more, we hope to see it implant
some of the freshness and vigor of
its youth in the classic soils of Old
E u rope.
In the meantime it will make a
better citizenship and elevate the
standard of manhood at home. It
will, in the words of its founders,
"promote the public welfare by ex
ercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teaching
the blessings of liberty regulated
by law, and inculcating love and
reverence for the great principles
of government as derived from the
inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happi
ness."
Each class sent forth represents
so much Stanford influence in
jected into the social and industrial
system of our country, penetrating
to its utmost limits, just as every
throb of the heart sends the life
blood to every extremity of the
body.
•The Class of '99 is on the eve of
being thus sent forth into the
world to swell the ranks of Stan
ford alumni —let us hope not the
ranks of the unemployed. At any
raie we are about to take up the
responsibilities of life. And we
can assure those who are left be
hind and those who have gone be
fore that we shall use our best
endeavor to uphold the honor and
dignity of our Alma Mater.
In leaving the University we are
compelled to sever many ties and
connections that have grown dear
to us. We must part from many
of the best friends we have ever
known. We have become attached
to the University and its associ
ations. There is an indescribable
something that seems to hold us
here even when we would go. But
all these must be left behind.
Sometimes, perhaps, we may par
tially forget them. But there will
lie times when our minds will steal
back to the old place, and through
the golden haze of time memory
will paint on our vision these
poems of stone now about us. We
will think of the four years we have
spent under their influence; we will
think of the old Quad, of which we
are all so proud; we will recall
those nooks and corners which are
dear to us from association; and
finally, perhaps, our minds will
wander up the arcade to a certain
spot, before a then magnificent
chapel, which bears the inscription
" '99"—a1l that remains to remind
the students of those days that
there was a class of '99.
We are here now for the purpose
of dedicating to the University the
plate which bears that inscription.
We have come to the close of our
college course. We have had our
joys and our disappointments in
college life; but that is over now.
Before we leave that life we pause
to pay one more tribute to the Uni
versity; and in this, the last act of
the Class of ? 9!), present this plate
to our Alma, Mater as a token of
our gratitude and esteem.
Dr. Jordan, in the name of the
('lass of '99. 1 present you this
plate which is imbedded here as an
integral part of this grand old
quadrangle ; so the Class of '99
hopes to form an integral part of
that great structure that Stan
ford University is building in the
intelligence and manhood of our
I citizens, and we leave this plate in
j this structure as symbolical of our
part in the grander structure.
It hears but a small relation to
the many other squares that en
circle this quadrangle ; so we will
hear hut a small relation to the
greater edifice.
This is ihe fourth plate you have
stood here to receive, and no douht
as you look at each of them some
pleasant recollection of the class it
represents is brought to your mind.
May it he so in after years when
this plate, bearing the numerals '91),
shall greet your eye
We hope, for the sake of the
University, and for the sake of
higher education, that you will
stand here to receive many more of
these plates. For just in propor
tion as this line of bronze length
ens so will your influence, which
forms so large a part of Stanford
influence, go forth into the world.
Some day, perhaps, in the far dis
tant future, when this line of plates
shall haw crept slowly around (lie
arcades until it lias eneiicled the
entire quadrangle, an adequate
conception can he foin ed <>112 ihe
magnitude of that influence.
For the present, we of the Class
of '99 can only dedicate our plate
to Stanford University with the ut
most, gratitude for what she has
done for us, and with the earnest
hope that among the many that are
to follow ours shall not entirely he
forgotten. Oiias. S. Chanplkr.
The Class Day exercises, held in
the chapel, began promptly at hall
past ten on Monday morning. Al
most every hour on Monday car
ried with it some part ot the Class
Day festivities, but at no moment
from President Arnold's opening
speech in the morning to the last
waltz at the ball at night, did any
thing tend to break a lull round of
enjoyment.
The chapel was crowded with a
most appreciative audience, when
President Arnold delivered the ad
dress of welcome:
Friendtt and Fellow Students : —
It is my privilege and pleasure as
a representative of the Class of '99
to welcome you here this morning.
We are going to graduate, and we
want you to help us celebrate the
event this week. Although we are
few in number, no one will deny
that we are the Hnest class for our
size that has ever graduated from
Stanford University. Our class
historian will prove this to you a
little later.
Surely the saying that "a bad
beginning brings a good ending"
has been proven true in our case.
We came here when the very exist
ence of the University was in
doubt; we have passed through all
of the trying uncertainties attend
ant upon such a condition ; and,
now, as a reward we are permitted
to witness the beginning of a new
epoch in the history of Stanford
University that will make its name
stand tor one of the world's great
est institutions of learning.
Upon our graduation we will be
come part of an Alumni that has
already made itself felt in the busy
world outside, and it is our ambi
tion to add our mite to this influ
ence that already extends to the
very outskirts of civilization.
To those of our fellow students
who have gone or. before us, we ex
tend our thanks for the many little
helps they gave us when we were
Freshmen, and to the Class of '98
especially do we owe much for
teaching 11s that noblest trait in
human character, forbearance. The
Class of 1900 has also done its
share to impress us that i( patience
is a virtue" when we are sur
rounded by the intricacies of this
lite as well as when we are tied up
with baling rope.
We congratulate those who follow
us on theever widening possibilities
offered them by our Alma Mater,
and we hope that they may be
as ready to take advantage of these
possibilities as were the members
of the pioneer classes.
To our professors and instructors
we owe a debt of gratitude that can
never be repaid. Our patient
teachers in the class room and
laboratory, our genial companions
and ever helpful friends in our so
cial life, they have left upon our
characters an everlasting influence.
The final tribute of the Class of
'99 we offer to her whose loving de
votion and thoughtful care has en
abled us to receive such a benefi
cent education. It was she who
took the silver lining from thedark
cloud of litigation that hung on us
at our entrance here, and with it
has made possible that magnificieni
building wherein will be enacted
the closing scene of our college
career. To her all thanks !
Ralph Filcher, Class Historian,
then give the account of the haps
and mishaps that '99 found in hei
Jour years of undergraduate lit'-,

working the thread of his story
through a humorous introduction
to an impressive ending.
History of the '99 Class.
When the '99 Class entered the
University, perceiving that alto
gether too much attention had heen
paid to athletics, she cast 11 bout her
for some other Held wherein to
work. The intellectual Held was
comparatively unfilled and into
this rushed : 99 with energy and zeal
As a consequence soon the staff
of editors of the Daily Palo Alto
was increased three-fold and event
ually four mem hers of the class
dictated its editorial policy.
In the second year Josh was
started with a '99 man at its head,
and the third year the class tried
its hand at making an Annual. As
to the result of the latter work let
posterity judge whether any class
will excel it in this line.
Debating was next essayed and
our record of two men on each of
the regular Intercollegiate teams
for 1898 and 1899 stands as a monu
ment to our forensic ability.
However, while we were making
strides in intellectual lines, ath
letics also prospered, fora few of.
our men had declined the honors
of the pen and the forum and given
their best muscle, as well as brain, to
the maintenance of our athletic
si andard.
Of the record which those men
who took up athletics have made
we believe the University is proud.
Several examples of the rarest
athletic genius do we prize. John
Brunton, track captain for 1898, was
easily the best short distance man
that Stanford has had. Lewis
Freeman is the only Stanford man
who has won Varsity sweaters for
football, baseball, track, and tennis.
Captain Fisher of this year's eleven
sent his men through a season of
the greatest discouragement with
energy and determination and
never despaired until time was
called at the last of the second
half. Track Captain Smith has
combined athletics with literary
work and won for us the intercol
legiate mile record.
Five star football players and
worthy representatives on the dia
mond. track, and tennis court, are
we proud to claim. In addition to
the records of the individual men,
as evidence of the activity which
'99 stands for in athletic lines, the
work which has been done toward
securing that much needed institu
tion, a training-house, stands
boldly in the front.
Not least among the things of
which '99 is proud is the fact that
with her will graduate some of the
most famous men of t he U ni versity —
men who, though through mistake
did enter college with other classes,
have since seen the error of their
way and allied themselves with '99.
For their good taste —or that of the
faculty —the highest compliment is
flue.
Passing from our achievements
in various lines of endeavor, it may
be said in general that the gradua
tion of '99 marks an epoch in the
history of this University —connect-
ing link that the class is between
the future and the memories and
traditions of the past.
With the graduation of '99 there
leave college the last of those men
who have known and appreciated
the spirit of the pioneer, whose ac
quaintance has been intimate with
the men who made the present un
dergraduate life of Stiii ford what
it is, developed its traditions, its
pleasures, and its college spirit.
Later classes must turn to us to
I pa r 11 the legrt (1- of the Un i versi I y's
< hildhood. f<>r we are the bridge be

tween the infancy and the man
hood of the institution.
With the magnificent buildings
finished and those in contempla
tion, the University will henceforth
rank among the best equipped in the
world. The next generation ofclasses
will pass by the new Library, the
new Chapel, and the new Assembly
Hall. They will see the University
in its expanded glory, and they
will never be aware of an intenser
life that once centered around the
•'Old Quad."
But we will be the only class
that has known both the intimate
fellowship of the old University
and the larger life of the new, for
Wednesday the buildings of the
new Quad will be used in the first
Commencement exercises, for those
of '99.
But in a far deeper sense are we
the bridge between the old and the
new. Every arch in the Quad has
a meaning to us that no other class
can ever-know. We entered Stan
ford during her darkest hour
Others who come after us and share
in the great tide of prosperity may
know the affection that comes from
so great bounty. But only those
who have felt the hopes and
through which the founders had to
struggle, can ever experience such
deep personal love for these revered
arches as is shared by the mem
bers of '99. 11. E Filcher.
Following the annual custom,
J. Frank English, on behalf of '01,
presented the sophomore cane, with
all its privileges, to the Class of '02,
with the admonition that it should
stand up for all Sophomore prece
dents, and see to it that 1903 be al
lowed to carry the cane only on the
gaining of second year standing.
Professor Murray spoke the last
words for the faculty to the out
going class. His address follows:
As a college year draws to its
close different thoughts come to dif
ferent individuals, but there is a
universal feeling of satisfaction that
the year's work is over and that the
tension mav be relaxed fora time.
For tension there is in the serious
work of the year, and although
many a one doubtless feels that he
might have accomplished more than
he has, yet the large majority can
look back upon a period of earnest
effort.
When, therefore, the last exami
nation is past a change comes over
a college community ; spirits are
higher, hearts are buoyant. Work
is done for the time being at least,
and small wonder that many take
the first train for home, leaving new
friends, it may be, with a touch of
regret, but glad to rejoin the old
friends ; small wonder too that
many whose homes are near and
who have not that reason for leav
ing, still take gun and fishing rod
and flee to the woods, and that those
who remain avoid all Commence
ment festivities —at least all those at
which they must listen to any talk
ing. Have they not spent the last
eight or ten months in going from
one room in the quadrangle to an
other to listen to talking and lectur
ing, when it may be they would far
rather be somewhere else ? But
now a respite has come. And yet
those of you who are to be grad
uated on Wednesday next still
linger. Some even of your number
have left, but most of you are still
here, and this is your day, the day
of the Class of '99 It is a day of
good feeling ; you have squared ac
counts with your instructors and
now your diplomas are as good as
yours. You meet here to celebrate,

to have a good time with a glance
at the future and a glance at the
past ; with a good-humored sense
of satisfaction and contentment,
and, perhaps, a playtul recognition
of one another's feelings. And on
this, your own day, yon have
chosen to give one of the faculty a
chance at you.
Happily circumstanees are all on
your side. We are all in good
humor, and if you are tired of hear
ing lectures, we are also tired ol
giving them. We don't feel like
multiplying words, but, most of all,
like giving a shake of the hand and
a God-bless-you and turning each
his own way.
And yet even in the humor of a
class-day prophecy with its good
natured satire, even in your last
jokes about men and things that
have been familiar through these
years, there is another vein, not of
out and out sadness, but a vein of
deeper feeling. You leave us now ;
yes, you can snap your fingers at
us if you feel like it; but that is
just the point. I honestly be
lieve you don't feel like it.
True there is now and then in var
ious places a recrudescence of the
puerile view that faculty and stu
dents make up hostile camps; true
the old conception of a hard and
fast dividing line between the two
is not absolutely dead in some quar
ters; true again that in any col
lege community some must teach
and others must listen; but despite
all this a saner, wholesoiner view
prevails with us. Our way of look
ing at such things, is that we have
been a body of good friends, work
iug together for common ends —
ends that are not for self alone, but
for one another. We have loved to
call this the Stanford spirit, hon
estly believing that it prevails here
more than in most, if not all of our
sister institutions; and we are jeal
ous of it. If on your part you have
seen —as I hope you have not —
any indications of a lessening of
this freedom of intercourse, of this
friendliness among the members of
our community, let it be a part of
your duty, as you join the ranks of
the alumni, to make your influence
tell against any such forces. This
is perhaps our strongest, our most
cherished tradition. And you can
do this the more easily inasmuch
as you cease now to be Stanford
students only to become in another
sense co-operators with us. Retain
your loyalty, retain and cherish
this healthful spirit that obtains
among us, and each year shall see
a strengthening of the ties that bind
us all together.
We lead busy lives here, intense
lives, but not warped or cramped
lives. The old scholastic ideal of a
quiet cell where the recluse could
withdraw from the world to pore
over musty tomes and wear his life
out in study, does not fit our large
view of life. We cherish all that
the past has learned of truth in
every line of human thought, and
we honor all who have added any
thing, however small, to the stock
of the world's knowledge; but in
our view this earnest, restless
search for truth goes hand in hand
with a recognition of the fact that
there are others about us striving
in their way to attain to the same
goal, and we like to put shoulder to
shoulder and work together.
Have you found much pedantry
here? much parade of learning?
Have you not rather found that
scholarship is put above learning,
and that one is tolerant of another,
not belittling his work but glad to
believe that the line ot work he has
chosen is the best for him ? This
is another manifestation ol the
same spirit, and this large tolerance
we cherish too. It prevents our
lives from being narrow, or from
seeming narrow to one another,
even when one may not be in a
position to appreciate another's
work. We credit one another with
being men and women with large
views and high ideals, men and
women to whom life is very real and
very rich—who touch what is liv
ing and what is vital in their work.
Now am I wrong in feeling that
you carry away these views with
you? I trust not, for these things
are worth holding fast. We who
remain cherish them, hold them to
be not only true, but the most strik
ing characteristics of our life here,
and in maintaining these things you
can help us. Few, if any, of you
sever absolutely your connection
with Stanford and her foster chil
dren; none of you, I am sure, go
forth without a loyal pride in our
University. As alumni and alumnae
you can aid in fostering these tilings
often more effectively than we can
do it ourselves. And to foster these
is to work against all tendencies you
may have seen in your college life
that make against this frank and
friendly and sympathetic spirit
which we hold to be ours. It mat
ters not where these things have
cropped out; it may have been in
college politics, it may have been
in social life shown by a tendency
toward snobbishness, it may have
been in fraternity life, or again in
athletics. Take the last as an in
stance; we are proud of our record —
not this year of our victories, al
though that matters but little, but
proud to think that our athletics
have in the main been exceptionally
clean. Here, if undergraduate zeal
runs beyond judgment, we need a
strong sentiment 011 the part of the
alumni. Neither you nor we want
any man brought here for athletics'
sake, because he will help us in
football or 011 the track, even if the
letter of the law governing college
athletics be not infringed in bring
ing him. We want more of sport
for sport's sake, and less of sport
for the sake of winning, and we
want every position 011 every team
to be open to any man in college
who shall prove himself the best
man, regardless of position or of
affiliations.
For we are a democracy, and re
joice in equal opportunities for all
equal opportunities in the classroom,
011 the field, and in social relations.
We believe in worth, and in worth
alone, and jealously guard as open
to all, all that our University life of
fers, holding that, in the long run,
worth prevails.
Now I have done. Pardon me
if 011 your own day I have imposed
011 your courtesv and nreached to
you once more Doubtless you feel
that of all this you have had enough
and more than enough; but take
this not as a parting shot, but as a
friendly word of farewell. You go
your separate ways, but you are
still ours. We claim your interest
and your help, desiring nothing so
much as that the things that char
acterize our life here be not things
that are petty and trivial, but things
that are true, honorable, and just,
pure, lovely, and of good report.
The last will and testament of the
class, which had been drawn up by
the leading legal lights of '99, was
read by Mr. Suzzallo:
To all to whom these presents may
come, In this wide and spacious
principality of Stanford University,
of the county of Santa Clara, and
the State of California, presided over
and governed by his most high and
maguificent mightiness, David Starr

Jordan, and his worthy co-dignitary
in domestic management, that re
nowned and undaunted knight,
Chas. Hrnest Schwartz.
We, the Class of' 99 of L. S. J. U.,
domiciled and situated in the afore
said domain, and of the age of 4
years more or less, being in full pos
session of the powers of maturity,
and of sound mind and disposing
memory, not acting under menace,
fraud, undue influence, corruption,
or intimidation whatsoever, but with

of science and mankind, the answers
to the following queries:
Why Encitia Hall is considered
the province and subject of special
and class legislation, applicable to
110 other dwelling or domicile 011 the
campus?
Why men are not chosen for the
Glee Club 011 account of their ability
to sing, rather than for ability to
pose?
Why that new "frat" has not an
nounced itself?
Why rival "frats" can not act in
harmony concerning the interests of
the University?
Why the Associated Students
paid $475 fora piano which is
worthless for student body purposes?
Why students who have never
interested themselves in athletics
wear the cardinal sweater with im
punity?
Why certain and honorable ser
vants are not relegated to the shelf?
Why the members of the Glee
Club were allowed to extend the time
of payment of their notes to Novem
ber next?
Secondly.—We give and bequeath
our time honored powers and pre

we know it is, the Class of 1900, for
their own separate use during their
life. Provided and 011 condition that
if any member of the aforesaid bene

A. H Suzzallo.
After the close of the exercises in
the chapel, the audience immedi
ately assembled before the portico
of the new chapel, where the cere
monies attendant 011 the dedication
of the '99 bronze tablet were held.
C. S. Chandler, for '99, presented
the plate to the University, Dr. Jor
dan accepting it. These ceremon
ies were closed by the singing of
" Hail, Stanford, Hail ! "
We are assembled here today for
the purpose of adding one more
monument to Stanford University.
The custom of the Senior Class to
dedicate to the University a hronze
plate in the pavement of the ar
cades is now well established. And
these plates before us mark mile
stones in the history of Stanford.
The line is short; so is the history
of the University. Yet it has not
been without its dark side. There
was a period once, in which, beset
with doubt and uncertainty, it
seemed that the University must
fail. Yet in the face of this adver
sity, in the worst period of Stanford
history, when the doors were opened
fora new year, it was found that
307 young men and women had
confidence enough in Stanford to
entrust four years of the most crit
ical period of their lives to her
care.
No better tribute could be paid
to the University than to say that
such a number of students could be
found to enter at such a time. And
no better proof of the loyalty of the
Class of '99 to Stanford could be
had than the fact that it is composed
of those students.
Four years have passed since
then. In the meantime we have
seen our Alma Mater emerge from
the dark ages of its history. With
joy in our hearts we have seen it
enter upon a period of prosperity
and expansion. Though some of
us are opposed to expansion in its
latest signification, we unanimously
approve of it in this particular in
stance. We hope to see our Uni
versity mow and expand until its
influence sha'l become a factor, not
only in California, not only on the
Pacific Coast, not only in our own
country, but throughout the entire

world. We hope to see it become
largely instrumental in carrying
enlightenment and civilization to
the Far East, and to the Southern
Continent of America. And further
more, we hope to see it implant
some of the freshness and vigor of
its youth in the classic soils of Old
E u rope.
In the meantime it will make a
better citizenship and elevate the
standard of manhood at home. It
will, in the words of its founders,
"promote the public welfare by ex
ercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teaching
the blessings of liberty regulated
by law, and inculcating love and
reverence for the great principles
of government as derived from the
inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happi
ness."
Each class sent forth represents
so much Stanford influence in
jected into the social and industrial
system of our country, penetrating
to its utmost limits, just as every
throb of the heart sends the life
blood to every extremity of the
body.
•The Class of '99 is on the eve of
being thus sent forth into the
world to swell the ranks of Stan
ford alumni —let us hope not the
ranks of the unemployed. At any
raie we are about to take up the
responsibilities of life. And we
can assure those who are left be
hind and those who have gone be
fore that we shall use our best
endeavor to uphold the honor and
dignity of our Alma Mater.
In leaving the University we are
compelled to sever many ties and
connections that have grown dear
to us. We must part from many
of the best friends we have ever
known. We have become attached
to the University and its associ
ations. There is an indescribable
something that seems to hold us
here even when we would go. But
all these must be left behind.
Sometimes, perhaps, we may par
tially forget them. But there will
lie times when our minds will steal
back to the old place, and through
the golden haze of time memory
will paint on our vision these
poems of stone now about us. We
will think of the four years we have
spent under their influence; we will
think of the old Quad, of which we
are all so proud; we will recall
those nooks and corners which are
dear to us from association; and
finally, perhaps, our minds will
wander up the arcade to a certain
spot, before a then magnificent
chapel, which bears the inscription
" '99"—a1l that remains to remind
the students of those days that
there was a class of '99.
We are here now for the purpose
of dedicating to the University the
plate which bears that inscription.
We have come to the close of our
college course. We have had our
joys and our disappointments in
college life; but that is over now.
Before we leave that life we pause
to pay one more tribute to the Uni
versity; and in this, the last act of
the Class of ? 9!), present this plate
to our Alma, Mater as a token of
our gratitude and esteem.
Dr. Jordan, in the name of the
('lass of '99. 1 present you this
plate which is imbedded here as an
integral part of this grand old
quadrangle ; so the Class of '99
hopes to form an integral part of
that great structure that Stan
ford University is building in the
intelligence and manhood of our
I citizens, and we leave this plate in
j this structure as symbolical of our
part in the grander structure.
It hears but a small relation to
the many other squares that en
circle this quadrangle ; so we will
hear hut a small relation to the
greater edifice.
This is ihe fourth plate you have
stood here to receive, and no douht
as you look at each of them some
pleasant recollection of the class it
represents is brought to your mind.
May it he so in after years when
this plate, bearing the numerals '91),
shall greet your eye
We hope, for the sake of the
University, and for the sake of
higher education, that you will
stand here to receive many more of
these plates. For just in propor
tion as this line of bronze length
ens so will your influence, which
forms so large a part of Stanford
influence, go forth into the world.
Some day, perhaps, in the far dis
tant future, when this line of plates
shall haw crept slowly around (lie
arcades until it lias eneiicled the
entire quadrangle, an adequate
conception can he foin ed <>112 ihe
magnitude of that influence.
For the present, we of the Class
of '99 can only dedicate our plate
to Stanford University with the ut
most, gratitude for what she has
done for us, and with the earnest
hope that among the many that are
to follow ours shall not entirely he
forgotten. Oiias. S. Chanplkr.
The Class Day exercises, held in
the chapel, began promptly at hall
past ten on Monday morning. Al
most every hour on Monday car
ried with it some part ot the Class
Day festivities, but at no moment
from President Arnold's opening
speech in the morning to the last
waltz at the ball at night, did any
thing tend to break a lull round of
enjoyment.
The chapel was crowded with a
most appreciative audience, when
President Arnold delivered the ad
dress of welcome:
Friendtt and Fellow Students : —
It is my privilege and pleasure as
a representative of the Class of '99
to welcome you here this morning.
We are going to graduate, and we
want you to help us celebrate the
event this week. Although we are
few in number, no one will deny
that we are the Hnest class for our
size that has ever graduated from
Stanford University. Our class
historian will prove this to you a
little later.
Surely the saying that "a bad
beginning brings a good ending"
has been proven true in our case.
We came here when the very exist
ence of the University was in
doubt; we have passed through all
of the trying uncertainties attend
ant upon such a condition ; and,
now, as a reward we are permitted
to witness the beginning of a new
epoch in the history of Stanford
University that will make its name
stand tor one of the world's great
est institutions of learning.
Upon our graduation we will be
come part of an Alumni that has
already made itself felt in the busy
world outside, and it is our ambi
tion to add our mite to this influ
ence that already extends to the
very outskirts of civilization.
To those of our fellow students
who have gone or. before us, we ex
tend our thanks for the many little
helps they gave us when we were
Freshmen, and to the Class of '98
especially do we owe much for
teaching 11s that noblest trait in
human character, forbearance. The
Class of 1900 has also done its
share to impress us that i( patience
is a virtue" when we are sur
rounded by the intricacies of this
lite as well as when we are tied up
with baling rope.
We congratulate those who follow
us on theever widening possibilities
offered them by our Alma Mater,
and we hope that they may be
as ready to take advantage of these
possibilities as were the members
of the pioneer classes.
To our professors and instructors
we owe a debt of gratitude that can
never be repaid. Our patient
teachers in the class room and
laboratory, our genial companions
and ever helpful friends in our so
cial life, they have left upon our
characters an everlasting influence.
The final tribute of the Class of
'99 we offer to her whose loving de
votion and thoughtful care has en
abled us to receive such a benefi
cent education. It was she who
took the silver lining from thedark
cloud of litigation that hung on us
at our entrance here, and with it
has made possible that magnificieni
building wherein will be enacted
the closing scene of our college
career. To her all thanks !
Ralph Filcher, Class Historian,
then give the account of the haps
and mishaps that '99 found in hei
Jour years of undergraduate lit'-,

working the thread of his story
through a humorous introduction
to an impressive ending.
History of the '99 Class.
When the '99 Class entered the
University, perceiving that alto
gether too much attention had heen
paid to athletics, she cast 11 bout her
for some other Held wherein to
work. The intellectual Held was
comparatively unfilled and into
this rushed : 99 with energy and zeal
As a consequence soon the staff
of editors of the Daily Palo Alto
was increased three-fold and event
ually four mem hers of the class
dictated its editorial policy.
In the second year Josh was
started with a '99 man at its head,
and the third year the class tried
its hand at making an Annual. As
to the result of the latter work let
posterity judge whether any class
will excel it in this line.
Debating was next essayed and
our record of two men on each of
the regular Intercollegiate teams
for 1898 and 1899 stands as a monu
ment to our forensic ability.
However, while we were making
strides in intellectual lines, ath
letics also prospered, fora few of.
our men had declined the honors
of the pen and the forum and given
their best muscle, as well as brain, to
the maintenance of our athletic
si andard.
Of the record which those men
who took up athletics have made
we believe the University is proud.
Several examples of the rarest
athletic genius do we prize. John
Brunton, track captain for 1898, was
easily the best short distance man
that Stanford has had. Lewis
Freeman is the only Stanford man
who has won Varsity sweaters for
football, baseball, track, and tennis.
Captain Fisher of this year's eleven
sent his men through a season of
the greatest discouragement with
energy and determination and
never despaired until time was
called at the last of the second
half. Track Captain Smith has
combined athletics with literary
work and won for us the intercol
legiate mile record.
Five star football players and
worthy representatives on the dia
mond. track, and tennis court, are
we proud to claim. In addition to
the records of the individual men,
as evidence of the activity which
'99 stands for in athletic lines, the
work which has been done toward
securing that much needed institu
tion, a training-house, stands
boldly in the front.
Not least among the things of
which '99 is proud is the fact that
with her will graduate some of the
most famous men of t he U ni versity —
men who, though through mistake
did enter college with other classes,
have since seen the error of their
way and allied themselves with '99.
For their good taste —or that of the
faculty —the highest compliment is
flue.
Passing from our achievements
in various lines of endeavor, it may
be said in general that the gradua
tion of '99 marks an epoch in the
history of this University —connect-
ing link that the class is between
the future and the memories and
traditions of the past.
With the graduation of '99 there
leave college the last of those men
who have known and appreciated
the spirit of the pioneer, whose ac
quaintance has been intimate with
the men who made the present un
dergraduate life of Stiii ford what
it is, developed its traditions, its
pleasures, and its college spirit.
Later classes must turn to us to
I pa r 11 the legrt (1- of the Un i versi I y's
< hildhood. f<>r we are the bridge be

tween the infancy and the man
hood of the institution.
With the magnificent buildings
finished and those in contempla
tion, the University will henceforth
rank among the best equipped in the
world. The next generation ofclasses
will pass by the new Library, the
new Chapel, and the new Assembly
Hall. They will see the University
in its expanded glory, and they
will never be aware of an intenser
life that once centered around the
•'Old Quad."
But we will be the only class
that has known both the intimate
fellowship of the old University
and the larger life of the new, for
Wednesday the buildings of the
new Quad will be used in the first
Commencement exercises, for those
of '99.
But in a far deeper sense are we
the bridge between the old and the
new. Every arch in the Quad has
a meaning to us that no other class
can ever-know. We entered Stan
ford during her darkest hour
Others who come after us and share
in the great tide of prosperity may
know the affection that comes from
so great bounty. But only those
who have felt the hopes and
through which the founders had to
struggle, can ever experience such
deep personal love for these revered
arches as is shared by the mem
bers of '99. 11. E Filcher.
Following the annual custom,
J. Frank English, on behalf of '01,
presented the sophomore cane, with
all its privileges, to the Class of '02,
with the admonition that it should
stand up for all Sophomore prece
dents, and see to it that 1903 be al
lowed to carry the cane only on the
gaining of second year standing.
Professor Murray spoke the last
words for the faculty to the out
going class. His address follows:
As a college year draws to its
close different thoughts come to dif
ferent individuals, but there is a
universal feeling of satisfaction that
the year's work is over and that the
tension mav be relaxed fora time.
For tension there is in the serious
work of the year, and although
many a one doubtless feels that he
might have accomplished more than
he has, yet the large majority can
look back upon a period of earnest
effort.
When, therefore, the last exami
nation is past a change comes over
a college community ; spirits are
higher, hearts are buoyant. Work
is done for the time being at least,
and small wonder that many take
the first train for home, leaving new
friends, it may be, with a touch of
regret, but glad to rejoin the old
friends ; small wonder too that
many whose homes are near and
who have not that reason for leav
ing, still take gun and fishing rod
and flee to the woods, and that those
who remain avoid all Commence
ment festivities —at least all those at
which they must listen to any talk
ing. Have they not spent the last
eight or ten months in going from
one room in the quadrangle to an
other to listen to talking and lectur
ing, when it may be they would far
rather be somewhere else ? But
now a respite has come. And yet
those of you who are to be grad
uated on Wednesday next still
linger. Some even of your number
have left, but most of you are still
here, and this is your day, the day
of the Class of '99 It is a day of
good feeling ; you have squared ac
counts with your instructors and
now your diplomas are as good as
yours. You meet here to celebrate,

to have a good time with a glance
at the future and a glance at the
past ; with a good-humored sense
of satisfaction and contentment,
and, perhaps, a playtul recognition
of one another's feelings. And on
this, your own day, yon have
chosen to give one of the faculty a
chance at you.
Happily circumstanees are all on
your side. We are all in good
humor, and if you are tired of hear
ing lectures, we are also tired ol
giving them. We don't feel like
multiplying words, but, most of all,
like giving a shake of the hand and
a God-bless-you and turning each
his own way.
And yet even in the humor of a
class-day prophecy with its good
natured satire, even in your last
jokes about men and things that
have been familiar through these
years, there is another vein, not of
out and out sadness, but a vein of
deeper feeling. You leave us now ;
yes, you can snap your fingers at
us if you feel like it; but that is
just the point. I honestly be
lieve you don't feel like it.
True there is now and then in var
ious places a recrudescence of the
puerile view that faculty and stu
dents make up hostile camps; true
the old conception of a hard and
fast dividing line between the two
is not absolutely dead in some quar
ters; true again that in any col
lege community some must teach
and others must listen; but despite
all this a saner, wholesoiner view
prevails with us. Our way of look
ing at such things, is that we have
been a body of good friends, work
iug together for common ends —
ends that are not for self alone, but
for one another. We have loved to
call this the Stanford spirit, hon
estly believing that it prevails here
more than in most, if not all of our
sister institutions; and we are jeal
ous of it. If on your part you have
seen —as I hope you have not —
any indications of a lessening of
this freedom of intercourse, of this
friendliness among the members of
our community, let it be a part of
your duty, as you join the ranks of
the alumni, to make your influence
tell against any such forces. This
is perhaps our strongest, our most
cherished tradition. And you can
do this the more easily inasmuch
as you cease now to be Stanford
students only to become in another
sense co-operators with us. Retain
your loyalty, retain and cherish
this healthful spirit that obtains
among us, and each year shall see
a strengthening of the ties that bind
us all together.
We lead busy lives here, intense
lives, but not warped or cramped
lives. The old scholastic ideal of a
quiet cell where the recluse could
withdraw from the world to pore
over musty tomes and wear his life
out in study, does not fit our large
view of life. We cherish all that
the past has learned of truth in
every line of human thought, and
we honor all who have added any
thing, however small, to the stock
of the world's knowledge; but in
our view this earnest, restless
search for truth goes hand in hand
with a recognition of the fact that
there are others about us striving
in their way to attain to the same
goal, and we like to put shoulder to
shoulder and work together.
Have you found much pedantry
here? much parade of learning?
Have you not rather found that
scholarship is put above learning,
and that one is tolerant of another,
not belittling his work but glad to
believe that the line ot work he has
chosen is the best for him ? This
is another manifestation ol the
same spirit, and this large tolerance
we cherish too. It prevents our
lives from being narrow, or from
seeming narrow to one another,
even when one may not be in a
position to appreciate another's
work. We credit one another with
being men and women with large
views and high ideals, men and
women to whom life is very real and
very rich—who touch what is liv
ing and what is vital in their work.
Now am I wrong in feeling that
you carry away these views with
you? I trust not, for these things
are worth holding fast. We who
remain cherish them, hold them to
be not only true, but the most strik
ing characteristics of our life here,
and in maintaining these things you
can help us. Few, if any, of you
sever absolutely your connection
with Stanford and her foster chil
dren; none of you, I am sure, go
forth without a loyal pride in our
University. As alumni and alumnae
you can aid in fostering these tilings
often more effectively than we can
do it ourselves. And to foster these
is to work against all tendencies you
may have seen in your college life
that make against this frank and
friendly and sympathetic spirit
which we hold to be ours. It mat
ters not where these things have
cropped out; it may have been in
college politics, it may have been
in social life shown by a tendency
toward snobbishness, it may have
been in fraternity life, or again in
athletics. Take the last as an in
stance; we are proud of our record —
not this year of our victories, al
though that matters but little, but
proud to think that our athletics
have in the main been exceptionally
clean. Here, if undergraduate zeal
runs beyond judgment, we need a
strong sentiment 011 the part of the
alumni. Neither you nor we want
any man brought here for athletics'
sake, because he will help us in
football or 011 the track, even if the
letter of the law governing college
athletics be not infringed in bring
ing him. We want more of sport
for sport's sake, and less of sport
for the sake of winning, and we
want every position 011 every team
to be open to any man in college
who shall prove himself the best
man, regardless of position or of
affiliations.
For we are a democracy, and re
joice in equal opportunities for all
equal opportunities in the classroom,
011 the field, and in social relations.
We believe in worth, and in worth
alone, and jealously guard as open
to all, all that our University life of
fers, holding that, in the long run,
worth prevails.
Now I have done. Pardon me
if 011 your own day I have imposed
011 your courtesv and nreached to
you once more Doubtless you feel
that of all this you have had enough
and more than enough; but take
this not as a parting shot, but as a
friendly word of farewell. You go
your separate ways, but you are
still ours. We claim your interest
and your help, desiring nothing so
much as that the things that char
acterize our life here be not things
that are petty and trivial, but things
that are true, honorable, and just,
pure, lovely, and of good report.
The last will and testament of the
class, which had been drawn up by
the leading legal lights of '99, was
read by Mr. Suzzallo:
To all to whom these presents may
come, In this wide and spacious
principality of Stanford University,
of the county of Santa Clara, and
the State of California, presided over
and governed by his most high and
maguificent mightiness, David Starr

Jordan, and his worthy co-dignitary
in domestic management, that re
nowned and undaunted knight,
Chas. Hrnest Schwartz.
We, the Class of' 99 of L. S. J. U.,
domiciled and situated in the afore
said domain, and of the age of 4
years more or less, being in full pos
session of the powers of maturity,
and of sound mind and disposing
memory, not acting under menace,
fraud, undue influence, corruption,
or intimidation whatsoever, but with
the consideration of brotherly love
and charity for all, and with malice
nor hard feeling toward none, do

of science and mankind, the answers
to the following queries:
Why Encitia Hall is considered
the province and subject of special
and class legislation, applicable to
110 other dwelling or domicile 011 the
campus?
Why men are not chosen for the
Glee Club 011 account of their ability
to sing, rather than for ability to
pose?
Why that new "frat" has not an
nounced itself?
Why rival "frats" can not act in
harmony concerning the interests of
the University?
Why the Associated Students
paid $475 fora piano which is
worthless for student body purposes?
Why students who have never
interested themselves in athletics
wear the cardinal sweater with im
punity?
Why certain and honorable ser
vants are not relegated to the shelf?
Why the members of the Glee
Club were allowed to extend the time
of payment of their notes to Novem
ber next?
Secondly.—We give and bequeath
our time honored powers and pre
rogatives, together with all the
burdens and duties appurtenant and
incident to the use thereof, of what

we know it is, the Class of 1900, for
their own separate use during their
life. Provided and 011 condition that
if any member of the aforesaid bene

A. H Suzzallo.
After the close of the exercises in
the chapel, the audience immedi
ately assembled before the portico
of the new chapel, where the cere
monies attendant 011 the dedication
of the '99 bronze tablet were held.
C. S. Chandler, for '99, presented
the plate to the University, Dr. Jor
dan accepting it. These ceremon
ies were closed by the singing of
" Hail, Stanford, Hail ! "
We are assembled here today for
the purpose of adding one more
monument to Stanford University.
The custom of the Senior Class to
dedicate to the University a hronze
plate in the pavement of the ar
cades is now well established. And
these plates before us mark mile
stones in the history of Stanford.
The line is short; so is the history
of the University. Yet it has not
been without its dark side. There
was a period once, in which, beset
with doubt and uncertainty, it
seemed that the University must
fail. Yet in the face of this adver
sity, in the worst period of Stanford
history, when the doors were opened
fora new year, it was found that
307 young men and women had
confidence enough in Stanford to
entrust four years of the most crit
ical period of their lives to her
care.
No better tribute could be paid
to the University than to say that
such a number of students could be
found to enter at such a time. And
no better proof of the loyalty of the
Class of '99 to Stanford could be
had than the fact that it is composed
of those students.
Four years have passed since
then. In the meantime we have
seen our Alma Mater emerge from
the dark ages of its history. With
joy in our hearts we have seen it
enter upon a period of prosperity
and expansion. Though some of
us are opposed to expansion in its
latest signification, we unanimously
approve of it in this particular in
stance. We hope to see our Uni
versity mow and expand until its
influence sha'l become a factor, not
only in California, not only on the
Pacific Coast, not only in our own
country, but throughout the entire

world. We hope to see it become
largely instrumental in carrying
enlightenment and civilization to
the Far East, and to the Southern
Continent of America. And further
more, we hope to see it implant
some of the freshness and vigor of
its youth in the classic soils of Old
E u rope.
In the meantime it will make a
better citizenship and elevate the
standard of manhood at home. It
will, in the words of its founders,
"promote the public welfare by ex
ercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teaching
the blessings of liberty regulated
by law, and inculcating love and
reverence for the great principles
of government as derived from the
inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happi
ness."
Each class sent forth represents
so much Stanford influence in
jected into the social and industrial
system of our country, penetrating
to its utmost limits, just as every
throb of the heart sends the life
blood to every extremity of the
body.
•The Class of '99 is on the eve of
being thus sent forth into the
world to swell the ranks of Stan
ford alumni —let us hope not the
ranks of the unemployed. At any
raie we are about to take up the
responsibilities of life. And we
can assure those who are left be
hind and those who have gone be
fore that we shall use our best
endeavor to uphold the honor and
dignity of our Alma Mater.
In leaving the University we are
compelled to sever many ties and
connections that have grown dear
to us. We must part from many
of the best friends we have ever
known. We have become attached
to the University and its associ
ations. There is an indescribable
something that seems to hold us
here even when we would go. But
all these must be left behind.
Sometimes, perhaps, we may par
tially forget them. But there will
lie times when our minds will steal
back to the old place, and through
the golden haze of time memory
will paint on our vision these
poems of stone now about us. We
will think of the four years we have
spent under their influence; we will
think of the old Quad, of which we
are all so proud; we will recall
those nooks and corners which are
dear to us from association; and
finally, perhaps, our minds will
wander up the arcade to a certain
spot, before a then magnificent
chapel, which bears the inscription
" '99"—a1l that remains to remind
the students of those days that
there was a class of '99.
We are here now for the purpose
of dedicating to the University the
plate which bears that inscription.
We have come to the close of our
college course. We have had our
joys and our disappointments in
college life; but that is over now.
Before we leave that life we pause
to pay one more tribute to the Uni
versity; and in this, the last act of
the Class of ? 9!), present this plate
to our Alma, Mater as a token of
our gratitude and esteem.
Dr. Jordan, in the name of the
('lass of '99. 1 present you this
plate which is imbedded here as an
integral part of this grand old
quadrangle ; so the Class of '99
hopes to form an integral part of
that great structure that Stan
ford University is building in the
intelligence and manhood of our
I citizens, and we leave this plate in
j this structure as symbolical of our
part in the grander structure.
It hears but a small relation to
the many other squares that en
circle this quadrangle ; so we will
hear hut a small relation to the
greater edifice.
This is ihe fourth plate you have
stood here to receive, and no douht
as you look at each of them some
pleasant recollection of the class it
represents is brought to your mind.
May it he so in after years when
this plate, bearing the numerals '91),
shall greet your eye
We hope, for the sake of the
University, and for the sake of
higher education, that you will
stand here to receive many more of
these plates. For just in propor
tion as this line of bronze length
ens so will your influence, which
forms so large a part of Stanford
influence, go forth into the world.
Some day, perhaps, in the far dis
tant future, when this line of plates
shall haw crept slowly around (lie
arcades until it lias eneiicled the
entire quadrangle, an adequate
conception can he foin ed <>112 ihe
magnitude of that influence.
For the present, we of the Class
of '99 can only dedicate our plate
to Stanford University with the ut
most, gratitude for what she has
done for us, and with the earnest
hope that among the many that are
to follow ours shall not entirely he
forgotten. Oiias. S. Chanplkr.
The Class Day exercises, held in
the chapel, began promptly at hall
past ten on Monday morning. Al
most every hour on Monday car
ried with it some part ot the Class
Day festivities, but at no moment
from President Arnold's opening
speech in the morning to the last
waltz at the ball at night, did any
thing tend to break a lull round of
enjoyment.
The chapel was crowded with a
most appreciative audience, when
President Arnold delivered the ad
dress of welcome:
Friendtt and Fellow Students : —
It is my privilege and pleasure as
a representative of the Class of '99
to welcome you here this morning.
We are going to graduate, and we
want you to help us celebrate the
event this week. Although we are
few in number, no one will deny
that we are the Hnest class for our
size that has ever graduated from
Stanford University. Our class
historian will prove this to you a
little later.
Surely the saying that "a bad
beginning brings a good ending"
has been proven true in our case.
We came here when the very exist
ence of the University was in
doubt; we have passed through all
of the trying uncertainties attend
ant upon such a condition ; and,
now, as a reward we are permitted
to witness the beginning of a new
epoch in the history of Stanford
University that will make its name
stand tor one of the world's great
est institutions of learning.
Upon our graduation we will be
come part of an Alumni that has
already made itself felt in the busy
world outside, and it is our ambi
tion to add our mite to this influ
ence that already extends to the
very outskirts of civilization.
To those of our fellow students
who have gone or. before us, we ex
tend our thanks for the many little
helps they gave us when we were
Freshmen, and to the Class of '98
especially do we owe much for
teaching 11s that noblest trait in
human character, forbearance. The
Class of 1900 has also done its
share to impress us that i( patience
is a virtue" when we are sur
rounded by the intricacies of this
lite as well as when we are tied up
with baling rope.
We congratulate those who follow
us on theever widening possibilities
offered them by our Alma Mater,
and we hope that they may be
as ready to take advantage of these
possibilities as were the members
of the pioneer classes.
To our professors and instructors
we owe a debt of gratitude that can
never be repaid. Our patient
teachers in the class room and
laboratory, our genial companions
and ever helpful friends in our so
cial life, they have left upon our
characters an everlasting influence.
The final tribute of the Class of
'99 we offer to her whose loving de
votion and thoughtful care has en
abled us to receive such a benefi
cent education. It was she who
took the silver lining from thedark
cloud of litigation that hung on us
at our entrance here, and with it
has made possible that magnificieni
building wherein will be enacted
the closing scene of our college
career. To her all thanks !
Ralph Filcher, Class Historian,
then give the account of the haps
and mishaps that '99 found in hei
Jour years of undergraduate lit'-,

working the thread of his story
through a humorous introduction
to an impressive ending.
History of the '99 Class.
When the '99 Class entered the
University, perceiving that alto
gether too much attention had heen
paid to athletics, she cast 11 bout her
for some other Held wherein to
work. The intellectual Held was
comparatively unfilled and into
this rushed : 99 with energy and zeal
As a consequence soon the staff
of editors of the Daily Palo Alto
was increased three-fold and event
ually four mem hers of the class
dictated its editorial policy.
In the second year Josh was
started with a '99 man at its head,
and the third year the class tried
its hand at making an Annual. As
to the result of the latter work let
posterity judge whether any class
will excel it in this line.
Debating was next essayed and
our record of two men on each of
the regular Intercollegiate teams
for 1898 and 1899 stands as a monu
ment to our forensic ability.
However, while we were making
strides in intellectual lines, ath
letics also prospered, fora few of.
our men had declined the honors
of the pen and the forum and given
their best muscle, as well as brain, to
the maintenance of our athletic
si andard.
Of the record which those men
who took up athletics have made
we believe the University is proud.
Several examples of the rarest
athletic genius do we prize. John
Brunton, track captain for 1898, was
easily the best short distance man
that Stanford has had. Lewis
Freeman is the only Stanford man
who has won Varsity sweaters for
football, baseball, track, and tennis.
Captain Fisher of this year's eleven
sent his men through a season of
the greatest discouragement with
energy and determination and
never despaired until time was
called at the last of the second
half. Track Captain Smith has
combined athletics with literary
work and won for us the intercol
legiate mile record.
Five star football players and
worthy representatives on the dia
mond. track, and tennis court, are
we proud to claim. In addition to
the records of the individual men,
as evidence of the activity which
'99 stands for in athletic lines, the
work which has been done toward
securing that much needed institu
tion, a training-house, stands
boldly in the front.
Not least among the things of
which '99 is proud is the fact that
with her will graduate some of the
most famous men of t he U ni versity —
men who, though through mistake
did enter college with other classes,
have since seen the error of their
way and allied themselves with '99.
For their good taste —or that of the
faculty —the highest compliment is
flue.
Passing from our achievements
in various lines of endeavor, it may
be said in general that the gradua
tion of '99 marks an epoch in the
history of this University —connect-
ing link that the class is between
the future and the memories and
traditions of the past.
With the graduation of '99 there
leave college the last of those men
who have known and appreciated
the spirit of the pioneer, whose ac
quaintance has been intimate with
the men who made the present un
dergraduate life of Stiii ford what
it is, developed its traditions, its
pleasures, and its college spirit.
Later classes must turn to us to
I pa r 11 the legrt (1- of the Un i versi I y's
< hildhood. f<>r we are the bridge be

tween the infancy and the man
hood of the institution.
With the magnificent buildings
finished and those in contempla
tion, the University will henceforth
rank among the best equipped in the
world. The next generation ofclasses
will pass by the new Library, the
new Chapel, and the new Assembly
Hall. They will see the University
in its expanded glory, and they
will never be aware of an intenser
life that once centered around the
•'Old Quad."
But we will be the only class
that has known both the intimate
fellowship of the old University
and the larger life of the new, for
Wednesday the buildings of the
new Quad will be used in the first
Commencement exercises, for those
of '99.
But in a far deeper sense are we
the bridge between the old and the
new. Every arch in the Quad has
a meaning to us that no other class
can ever-know. We entered Stan
ford during her darkest hour
Others who come after us and share
in the great tide of prosperity may
know the affection that comes from
so great bounty. But only those
who have felt the hopes and
through which the founders had to
struggle, can ever experience such
deep personal love for these revered
arches as is shared by the mem
bers of '99. 11. E Filcher.
Following the annual custom,
J. Frank English, on behalf of '01,
presented the sophomore cane, with
all its privileges, to the Class of '02,
with the admonition that it should
stand up for all Sophomore prece
dents, and see to it that 1903 be al
lowed to carry the cane only on the
gaining of second year standing.
Professor Murray spoke the last
words for the faculty to the out
going class. His address follows:
As a college year draws to its
close different thoughts come to dif
ferent individuals, but there is a
universal feeling of satisfaction that
the year's work is over and that the
tension mav be relaxed fora time.
For tension there is in the serious
work of the year, and although
many a one doubtless feels that he
might have accomplished more than
he has, yet the large majority can
look back upon a period of earnest
effort.
When, therefore, the last exami
nation is past a change comes over
a college community ; spirits are
higher, hearts are buoyant. Work
is done for the time being at least,
and small wonder that many take
the first train for home, leaving new
friends, it may be, with a touch of
regret, but glad to rejoin the old
friends ; small wonder too that
many whose homes are near and
who have not that reason for leav
ing, still take gun and fishing rod
and flee to the woods, and that those
who remain avoid all Commence
ment festivities —at least all those at
which they must listen to any talk
ing. Have they not spent the last
eight or ten months in going from
one room in the quadrangle to an
other to listen to talking and lectur
ing, when it may be they would far
rather be somewhere else ? But
now a respite has come. And yet
those of you who are to be grad
uated on Wednesday next still
linger. Some even of your number
have left, but most of you are still
here, and this is your day, the day
of the Class of '99 It is a day of
good feeling ; you have squared ac
counts with your instructors and
now your diplomas are as good as
yours. You meet here to celebrate,

to have a good time with a glance
at the future and a glance at the
past ; with a good-humored sense
of satisfaction and contentment,
and, perhaps, a playtul recognition
of one another's feelings. And on
this, your own day, yon have
chosen to give one of the faculty a
chance at you.
Happily circumstanees are all on
your side. We are all in good
humor, and if you are tired of hear
ing lectures, we are also tired ol
giving them. We don't feel like
multiplying words, but, most of all,
like giving a shake of the hand and
a God-bless-you and turning each
his own way.
And yet even in the humor of a
class-day prophecy with its good
natured satire, even in your last
jokes about men and things that
have been familiar through these
years, there is another vein, not of
out and out sadness, but a vein of
deeper feeling. You leave us now ;
yes, you can snap your fingers at
us if you feel like it; but that is
just the point. I honestly be
lieve you don't feel like it.
True there is now and then in var
ious places a recrudescence of the
puerile view that faculty and stu
dents make up hostile camps; true
the old conception of a hard and
fast dividing line between the two
is not absolutely dead in some quar
ters; true again that in any col
lege community some must teach
and others must listen; but despite
all this a saner, wholesoiner view
prevails with us. Our way of look
ing at such things, is that we have
been a body of good friends, work
iug together for common ends —
ends that are not for self alone, but
for one another. We have loved to
call this the Stanford spirit, hon
estly believing that it prevails here
more than in most, if not all of our
sister institutions; and we are jeal
ous of it. If on your part you have
seen —as I hope you have not —
any indications of a lessening of
this freedom of intercourse, of this
friendliness among the members of
our community, let it be a part of
your duty, as you join the ranks of
the alumni, to make your influence
tell against any such forces. This
is perhaps our strongest, our most
cherished tradition. And you can
do this the more easily inasmuch
as you cease now to be Stanford
students only to become in another
sense co-operators with us. Retain
your loyalty, retain and cherish
this healthful spirit that obtains
among us, and each year shall see
a strengthening of the ties that bind
us all together.
We lead busy lives here, intense
lives, but not warped or cramped
lives. The old scholastic ideal of a
quiet cell where the recluse could
withdraw from the world to pore
over musty tomes and wear his life
out in study, does not fit our large
view of life. We cherish all that
the past has learned of truth in
every line of human thought, and
we honor all who have added any
thing, however small, to the stock
of the world's knowledge; but in
our view this earnest, restless
search for truth goes hand in hand
with a recognition of the fact that
there are others about us striving
in their way to attain to the same
goal, and we like to put shoulder to
shoulder and work together.
Have you found much pedantry
here? much parade of learning?
Have you not rather found that
scholarship is put above learning,
and that one is tolerant of another,
not belittling his work but glad to
believe that the line ot work he has
chosen is the best for him ? This
is another manifestation ol the
same spirit, and this large tolerance
we cherish too. It prevents our
lives from being narrow, or from
seeming narrow to one another,
even when one may not be in a
position to appreciate another's
work. We credit one another with
being men and women with large
views and high ideals, men and
women to whom life is very real and
very rich—who touch what is liv
ing and what is vital in their work.
Now am I wrong in feeling that
you carry away these views with
you? I trust not, for these things
are worth holding fast. We who
remain cherish them, hold them to
be not only true, but the most strik
ing characteristics of our life here,
and in maintaining these things you
can help us. Few, if any, of you
sever absolutely your connection
with Stanford and her foster chil
dren; none of you, I am sure, go
forth without a loyal pride in our
University. As alumni and alumnae
you can aid in fostering these tilings
often more effectively than we can
do it ourselves. And to foster these
is to work against all tendencies you
may have seen in your college life
that make against this frank and
friendly and sympathetic spirit
which we hold to be ours. It mat
ters not where these things have
cropped out; it may have been in
college politics, it may have been
in social life shown by a tendency
toward snobbishness, it may have
been in fraternity life, or again in
athletics. Take the last as an in
stance; we are proud of our record —
not this year of our victories, al
though that matters but little, but
proud to think that our athletics
have in the main been exceptionally
clean. Here, if undergraduate zeal
runs beyond judgment, we need a
strong sentiment 011 the part of the
alumni. Neither you nor we want
any man brought here for athletics'
sake, because he will help us in
football or 011 the track, even if the
letter of the law governing college
athletics be not infringed in bring
ing him. We want more of sport
for sport's sake, and less of sport
for the sake of winning, and we
want every position 011 every team
to be open to any man in college
who shall prove himself the best
man, regardless of position or of
affiliations.
For we are a democracy, and re
joice in equal opportunities for all
equal opportunities in the classroom,
011 the field, and in social relations.
We believe in worth, and in worth
alone, and jealously guard as open
to all, all that our University life of
fers, holding that, in the long run,
worth prevails.
Now I have done. Pardon me
if 011 your own day I have imposed
011 your courtesv and nreached to
you once more Doubtless you feel
that of all this you have had enough
and more than enough; but take
this not as a parting shot, but as a
friendly word of farewell. You go
your separate ways, but you are
still ours. We claim your interest
and your help, desiring nothing so
much as that the things that char
acterize our life here be not things
that are petty and trivial, but things
that are true, honorable, and just,
pure, lovely, and of good report.
The last will and testament of the
class, which had been drawn up by
the leading legal lights of '99, was
read by Mr. Suzzallo:
To all to whom these presents may
come, In this wide and spacious
principality of Stanford University,
of the county of Santa Clara, and
the State of California, presided over
and governed by his most high and
maguificent mightiness, David Starr

Jordan, and his worthy co-dignitary
in domestic management, that re
nowned and undaunted knight,
Chas. Hrnest Schwartz.
We, the Class of' 99 of L. S. J. U.,
domiciled and situated in the afore
said domain, and of the age of 4
years more or less, being in full pos
session of the powers of maturity,
and of sound mind and disposing
memory, not acting under menace,
fraud, undue influence, corruption,
or intimidation whatsoever, but with

to the following queries:
Why Encitia Hall is considered
the province and subject of special

110 other dwelling or domicile 011 the
campus?
Why men are not chosen for the
Glee Club 011 account of their ability
to sing, rather than for ability to
pose?
Why that new "frat" has not an
nounced itself?
Why rival "frats" can not act in
harmony concerning the interests of
the University?
Why the Associated Students
paid $475 fora piano which is
worthless for student body purposes?
Why students who have never
interested themselves in athletics
wear the cardinal sweater with im
punity?
Why certain and honorable ser
vants are not relegated to the shelf?
Why the members of the Glee
Club were allowed to extend the time
of payment of their notes to Novem
ber next?
Secondly.—We give and bequeath
our time honored powers and pre

A. H Suzzallo.
After the close of the exercises in
the chapel, the audience immedi
ately assembled before the portico
of the new chapel, where the cere
monies attendant 011 the dedication
of the '99 bronze tablet were held.
C. S. Chandler, for '99, presented
the plate to the University, Dr. Jor
dan accepting it. These ceremon
ies were closed by the singing of
" Hail, Stanford, Hail ! "
We are assembled here today for
the purpose of adding one more
monument to Stanford University.
The custom of the Senior Class to
dedicate to the University a hronze
plate in the pavement of the ar
cades is now well established. And
these plates before us mark mile
stones in the history of Stanford.
The line is short; so is the history
of the University. Yet it has not
been without its dark side. There
was a period once, in which, beset
with doubt and uncertainty, it
seemed that the University must
fail. Yet in the face of this adver
sity, in the worst period of Stanford
history, when the doors were opened
fora new year, it was found that
307 young men and women had
confidence enough in Stanford to
entrust four years of the most crit
ical period of their lives to her
care.
No better tribute could be paid
to the University than to say that
such a number of students could be
found to enter at such a time. And
no better proof of the loyalty of the
Class of '99 to Stanford could be
had than the fact that it is composed
of those students.
Four years have passed since
then. In the meantime we have
seen our Alma Mater emerge from
the dark ages of its history. With
joy in our hearts we have seen it
enter upon a period of prosperity
and expansion. Though some of
us are opposed to expansion in its
latest signification, we unanimously
approve of it in this particular in
stance. We hope to see our Uni
versity mow and expand until its
influence sha'l become a factor, not
only in California, not only on the
Pacific Coast, not only in our own
country, but throughout the entire

world. We hope to see it become
largely instrumental in carrying
enlightenment and civilization to
the Far East, and to the Southern
Continent of America. And further
more, we hope to see it implant
some of the freshness and vigor of
its youth in the classic soils of Old
E u rope.
In the meantime it will make a
better citizenship and elevate the
standard of manhood at home. It
will, in the words of its founders,
"promote the public welfare by ex
ercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teaching
the blessings of liberty regulated
by law, and inculcating love and
reverence for the great principles
of government as derived from the
inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happi
ness."
Each class sent forth represents
so much Stanford influence in
jected into the social and industrial
system of our country, penetrating
to its utmost limits, just as every
throb of the heart sends the life
blood to every extremity of the
body.
•The Class of '99 is on the eve of
being thus sent forth into the
world to swell the ranks of Stan
ford alumni —let us hope not the
ranks of the unemployed. At any
raie we are about to take up the
responsibilities of life. And we
can assure those who are left be
hind and those who have gone be
fore that we shall use our best
endeavor to uphold the honor and
dignity of our Alma Mater.
In leaving the University we are
compelled to sever many ties and
connections that have grown dear
to us. We must part from many
of the best friends we have ever
known. We have become attached
to the University and its associ
ations. There is an indescribable
something that seems to hold us
here even when we would go. But
all these must be left behind.
Sometimes, perhaps, we may par
tially forget them. But there will
lie times when our minds will steal
back to the old place, and through
the golden haze of time memory
will paint on our vision these
poems of stone now about us. We
will think of the four years we have
spent under their influence; we will
think of the old Quad, of which we
are all so proud; we will recall
those nooks and corners which are
dear to us from association; and
finally, perhaps, our minds will
wander up the arcade to a certain
spot, before a then magnificent
chapel, which bears the inscription
" '99"—a1l that remains to remind
the students of those days that
there was a class of '99.
We are here now for the purpose
of dedicating to the University the
plate which bears that inscription.
We have come to the close of our
college course. We have had our
joys and our disappointments in
college life; but that is over now.
Before we leave that life we pause
to pay one more tribute to the Uni
versity; and in this, the last act of
the Class of ? 9!), present this plate
to our Alma, Mater as a token of
our gratitude and esteem.
Dr. Jordan, in the name of the
('lass of '99. 1 present you this
plate which is imbedded here as an
integral part of this grand old
quadrangle ; so the Class of '99
hopes to form an integral part of
that great structure that Stan
ford University is building in the
intelligence and manhood of our
I citizens, and we leave this plate in
j this structure as symbolical of our
part in the grander structure.
It hears but a small relation to
the many other squares that en
circle this quadrangle ; so we will
hear hut a small relation to the
greater edifice.
This is ihe fourth plate you have
stood here to receive, and no douht
as you look at each of them some
pleasant recollection of the class it
represents is brought to your mind.
May it he so in after years when
this plate, bearing the numerals '91),
shall greet your eye
We hope, for the sake of the
University, and for the sake of
higher education, that you will
stand here to receive many more of
these plates. For just in propor
tion as this line of bronze length
ens so will your influence, which
forms so large a part of Stanford
influence, go forth into the world.
Some day, perhaps, in the far dis
tant future, when this line of plates
shall haw crept slowly around (lie
arcades until it lias eneiicled the
entire quadrangle, an adequate
conception can he foin ed <>112 ihe
magnitude of that influence.
For the present, we of the Class
of '99 can only dedicate our plate
to Stanford University with the ut
most, gratitude for what she has
done for us, and with the earnest
hope that among the many that are
to follow ours shall not entirely he
forgotten. Oiias. S. Chanplkr.
The Class Day exercises, held in
the chapel, began promptly at hall
past ten on Monday morning. Al
most every hour on Monday car
ried with it some part ot the Class
Day festivities, but at no moment
from President Arnold's opening
speech in the morning to the last
waltz at the ball at night, did any
thing tend to break a lull round of
enjoyment.
The chapel was crowded with a
most appreciative audience, when
President Arnold delivered the ad
dress of welcome:
Friendtt and Fellow Students : —
It is my privilege and pleasure as
a representative of the Class of '99
to welcome you here this morning.
We are going to graduate, and we
want you to help us celebrate the
event this week. Although we are
few in number, no one will deny
that we are the Hnest class for our
size that has ever graduated from
Stanford University. Our class
historian will prove this to you a
little later.
Surely the saying that "a bad
beginning brings a good ending"
has been proven true in our case.
We came here when the very exist
ence of the University was in
doubt; we have passed through all
of the trying uncertainties attend
ant upon such a condition ; and,
now, as a reward we are permitted
to witness the beginning of a new
epoch in the history of Stanford
University that will make its name
stand tor one of the world's great
est institutions of learning.
Upon our graduation we will be
come part of an Alumni that has
already made itself felt in the busy
world outside, and it is our ambi
tion to add our mite to this influ
ence that already extends to the
very outskirts of civilization.
To those of our fellow students
who have gone or. before us, we ex
tend our thanks for the many little
helps they gave us when we were
Freshmen, and to the Class of '98
especially do we owe much for
teaching 11s that noblest trait in
human character, forbearance. The
Class of 1900 has also done its
share to impress us that i( patience
is a virtue" when we are sur
rounded by the intricacies of this
lite as well as when we are tied up
with baling rope.
We congratulate those who follow
us on theever widening possibilities
offered them by our Alma Mater,
and we hope that they may be
as ready to take advantage of these
possibilities as were the members
of the pioneer classes.
To our professors and instructors
we owe a debt of gratitude that can
never be repaid. Our patient
teachers in the class room and
laboratory, our genial companions
and ever helpful friends in our so
cial life, they have left upon our
characters an everlasting influence.
The final tribute of the Class of
'99 we offer to her whose loving de
votion and thoughtful care has en
abled us to receive such a benefi
cent education. It was she who
took the silver lining from thedark
cloud of litigation that hung on us
at our entrance here, and with it
has made possible that magnificieni
building wherein will be enacted
the closing scene of our college
career. To her all thanks !
Ralph Filcher, Class Historian,
then give the account of the haps
and mishaps that '99 found in hei
Jour years of undergraduate lit'-,

working the thread of his story
through a humorous introduction
to an impressive ending.
History of the '99 Class.
When the '99 Class entered the
University, perceiving that alto
gether too much attention had heen
paid to athletics, she cast 11 bout her
for some other Held wherein to
work. The intellectual Held was
comparatively unfilled and into
this rushed : 99 with energy and zeal
As a consequence soon the staff
of editors of the Daily Palo Alto
was increased three-fold and event
ually four mem hers of the class
dictated its editorial policy.
In the second year Josh was
started with a '99 man at its head,
and the third year the class tried
its hand at making an Annual. As
to the result of the latter work let
posterity judge whether any class
will excel it in this line.
Debating was next essayed and
our record of two men on each of
the regular Intercollegiate teams
for 1898 and 1899 stands as a monu
ment to our forensic ability.
However, while we were making
strides in intellectual lines, ath
letics also prospered, fora few of.
our men had declined the honors
of the pen and the forum and given
their best muscle, as well as brain, to
the maintenance of our athletic
si andard.
Of the record which those men
who took up athletics have made
we believe the University is proud.
Several examples of the rarest
athletic genius do we prize. John
Brunton, track captain for 1898, was
easily the best short distance man
that Stanford has had. Lewis
Freeman is the only Stanford man
who has won Varsity sweaters for
football, baseball, track, and tennis.
Captain Fisher of this year's eleven
sent his men through a season of
the greatest discouragement with
energy and determination and
never despaired until time was
called at the last of the second
half. Track Captain Smith has
combined athletics with literary
work and won for us the intercol
legiate mile record.
Five star football players and
worthy representatives on the dia
mond. track, and tennis court, are
we proud to claim. In addition to
the records of the individual men,
as evidence of the activity which
'99 stands for in athletic lines, the
work which has been done toward
securing that much needed institu
tion, a training-house, stands
boldly in the front.
Not least among the things of
which '99 is proud is the fact that
with her will graduate some of the
most famous men of t he U ni versity —
men who, though through mistake
did enter college with other classes,
have since seen the error of their
way and allied themselves with '99.
For their good taste —or that of the
faculty —the highest compliment is
flue.
Passing from our achievements
in various lines of endeavor, it may
be said in general that the gradua
tion of '99 marks an epoch in the
history of this University —connect-
ing link that the class is between
the future and the memories and
traditions of the past.
With the graduation of '99 there
leave college the last of those men
who have known and appreciated
the spirit of the pioneer, whose ac
quaintance has been intimate with
the men who made the present un
dergraduate life of Stiii ford what
it is, developed its traditions, its
pleasures, and its college spirit.
Later classes must turn to us to
I pa r 11 the legrt (1- of the Un i versi I y's
< hildhood. f<>r we are the bridge be

tween the infancy and the man
hood of the institution.
With the magnificent buildings
finished and those in contempla
tion, the University will henceforth
rank among the best equipped in the
world. The next generation ofclasses
will pass by the new Library, the
new Chapel, and the new Assembly
Hall. They will see the University
in its expanded glory, and they
will never be aware of an intenser
life that once centered around the
•'Old Quad."
But we will be the only class
that has known both the intimate
fellowship of the old University
and the larger life of the new, for
Wednesday the buildings of the
new Quad will be used in the first
Commencement exercises, for those
of '99.
But in a far deeper sense are we
the bridge between the old and the
new. Every arch in the Quad has
a meaning to us that no other class
can ever-know. We entered Stan
ford during her darkest hour
Others who come after us and share
in the great tide of prosperity may
know the affection that comes from
so great bounty. But only those
who have felt the hopes and
through which the founders had to
struggle, can ever experience such
deep personal love for these revered
arches as is shared by the mem
bers of '99. 11. E Filcher.
Following the annual custom,
J. Frank English, on behalf of '01,
presented the sophomore cane, with
all its privileges, to the Class of '02,
with the admonition that it should
stand up for all Sophomore prece
dents, and see to it that 1903 be al
lowed to carry the cane only on the
gaining of second year standing.
Professor Murray spoke the last
words for the faculty to the out
going class. His address follows:
As a college year draws to its
close different thoughts come to dif
ferent individuals, but there is a
universal feeling of satisfaction that
the year's work is over and that the
tension mav be relaxed fora time.
For tension there is in the serious
work of the year, and although
many a one doubtless feels that he
might have accomplished more than
he has, yet the large majority can
look back upon a period of earnest
effort.
When, therefore, the last exami
nation is past a change comes over
a college community ; spirits are
higher, hearts are buoyant. Work
is done for the time being at least,
and small wonder that many take
the first train for home, leaving new
friends, it may be, with a touch of
regret, but glad to rejoin the old
friends ; small wonder too that
many whose homes are near and
who have not that reason for leav
ing, still take gun and fishing rod
and flee to the woods, and that those
who remain avoid all Commence
ment festivities —at least all those at
which they must listen to any talk
ing. Have they not spent the last
eight or ten months in going from
one room in the quadrangle to an
other to listen to talking and lectur
ing, when it may be they would far
rather be somewhere else ? But
now a respite has come. And yet
those of you who are to be grad
uated on Wednesday next still
linger. Some even of your number
have left, but most of you are still
here, and this is your day, the day
of the Class of '99 It is a day of
good feeling ; you have squared ac
counts with your instructors and
now your diplomas are as good as
yours. You meet here to celebrate,

to have a good time with a glance
at the future and a glance at the
past ; with a good-humored sense
of satisfaction and contentment,
and, perhaps, a playtul recognition
of one another's feelings. And on
this, your own day, yon have
chosen to give one of the faculty a
chance at you.
Happily circumstanees are all on
your side. We are all in good
humor, and if you are tired of hear
ing lectures, we are also tired ol
giving them. We don't feel like
multiplying words, but, most of all,
like giving a shake of the hand and
a God-bless-you and turning each
his own way.
And yet even in the humor of a
class-day prophecy with its good
natured satire, even in your last
jokes about men and things that
have been familiar through these
years, there is another vein, not of
out and out sadness, but a vein of
deeper feeling. You leave us now ;
yes, you can snap your fingers at
us if you feel like it; but that is
just the point. I honestly be
lieve you don't feel like it.
True there is now and then in var
ious places a recrudescence of the
puerile view that faculty and stu
dents make up hostile camps; true
the old conception of a hard and
fast dividing line between the two
is not absolutely dead in some quar
ters; true again that in any col
lege community some must teach
and others must listen; but despite
all this a saner, wholesoiner view
prevails with us. Our way of look
ing at such things, is that we have
been a body of good friends, work
iug together for common ends —
ends that are not for self alone, but
for one another. We have loved to
call this the Stanford spirit, hon
estly believing that it prevails here
more than in most, if not all of our
sister institutions; and we are jeal
ous of it. If on your part you have
seen —as I hope you have not —
any indications of a lessening of
this freedom of intercourse, of this
friendliness among the members of
our community, let it be a part of
your duty, as you join the ranks of
the alumni, to make your influence
tell against any such forces. This
is perhaps our strongest, our most
cherished tradition. And you can
do this the more easily inasmuch
as you cease now to be Stanford
students only to become in another
sense co-operators with us. Retain
your loyalty, retain and cherish
this healthful spirit that obtains
among us, and each year shall see
a strengthening of the ties that bind
us all together.
We lead busy lives here, intense
lives, but not warped or cramped
lives. The old scholastic ideal of a
quiet cell where the recluse could
withdraw from the world to pore
over musty tomes and wear his life
out in study, does not fit our large
view of life. We cherish all that
the past has learned of truth in
every line of human thought, and
we honor all who have added any
thing, however small, to the stock
of the world's knowledge; but in
our view this earnest, restless
search for truth goes hand in hand
with a recognition of the fact that
there are others about us striving
in their way to attain to the same
goal, and we like to put shoulder to
shoulder and work together.
Have you found much pedantry
here? much parade of learning?
Have you not rather found that
scholarship is put above learning,
and that one is tolerant of another,
not belittling his work but glad to
believe that the line ot work he has
chosen is the best for him ? This
is another manifestation ol the
same spirit, and this large tolerance
we cherish too. It prevents our
lives from being narrow, or from
seeming narrow to one another,
even when one may not be in a
position to appreciate another's
work. We credit one another with
being men and women with large
views and high ideals, men and
women to whom life is very real and
very rich—who touch what is liv
ing and what is vital in their work.
Now am I wrong in feeling that
you carry away these views with
you? I trust not, for these things
are worth holding fast. We who
remain cherish them, hold them to
be not only true, but the most strik
ing characteristics of our life here,
and in maintaining these things you
can help us. Few, if any, of you
sever absolutely your connection
with Stanford and her foster chil
dren; none of you, I am sure, go
forth without a loyal pride in our
University. As alumni and alumnae
you can aid in fostering these tilings
often more effectively than we can
do it ourselves. And to foster these
is to work against all tendencies you
may have seen in your college life
that make against this frank and
friendly and sympathetic spirit
which we hold to be ours. It mat
ters not where these things have
cropped out; it may have been in
college politics, it may have been
in social life shown by a tendency
toward snobbishness, it may have
been in fraternity life, or again in
athletics. Take the last as an in
stance; we are proud of our record —
not this year of our victories, al
though that matters but little, but
proud to think that our athletics
have in the main been exceptionally
clean. Here, if undergraduate zeal
runs beyond judgment, we need a
strong sentiment 011 the part of the
alumni. Neither you nor we want
any man brought here for athletics'
sake, because he will help us in
football or 011 the track, even if the
letter of the law governing college
athletics be not infringed in bring
ing him. We want more of sport
for sport's sake, and less of sport
for the sake of winning, and we
want every position 011 every team
to be open to any man in college
who shall prove himself the best
man, regardless of position or of
affiliations.
For we are a democracy, and re
joice in equal opportunities for all
equal opportunities in the classroom,
011 the field, and in social relations.
We believe in worth, and in worth
alone, and jealously guard as open
to all, all that our University life of
fers, holding that, in the long run,
worth prevails.
Now I have done. Pardon me
if 011 your own day I have imposed
011 your courtesv and nreached to
you once more Doubtless you feel
that of all this you have had enough
and more than enough; but take
this not as a parting shot, but as a
friendly word of farewell. You go
your separate ways, but you are
still ours. We claim your interest
and your help, desiring nothing so
much as that the things that char
acterize our life here be not things
that are petty and trivial, but things
that are true, honorable, and just,
pure, lovely, and of good report.
The last will and testament of the
class, which had been drawn up by
the leading legal lights of '99, was
read by Mr. Suzzallo:
To all to whom these presents may
come, In this wide and spacious
principality of Stanford University,
of the county of Santa Clara, and
the State of California, presided over
and governed by his most high and
maguificent mightiness, David Starr

Jordan, and his worthy co-dignitary
in domestic management, that re
nowned and undaunted knight,
Chas. Hrnest Schwartz.
We, the Class of' 99 of L. S. J. U.,
domiciled and situated in the afore
said domain, and of the age of 4
years more or less, being in full pos
session of the powers of maturity,
and of sound mind and disposing
memory, not acting under menace,

Why that new "frat" has not an
nounced itself?
Why rival "frats" can not act in
harmony concerning the interests of
the University?
Why the Associated Students

worthless for student body purposes?
Why students who have never
interested themselves in athletics
wear the cardinal sweater with im

of payment of their notes to Novem

A. H Suzzallo.
After the close of the exercises in
the chapel, the audience immedi
ately assembled before the portico
of the new chapel, where the cere
monies attendant 011 the dedication
of the '99 bronze tablet were held.
C. S. Chandler, for '99, presented
the plate to the University, Dr. Jor
dan accepting it. These ceremon
ies were closed by the singing of
" Hail, Stanford, Hail ! "
We are assembled here today for
the purpose of adding one more
monument to Stanford University.
The custom of the Senior Class to
dedicate to the University a hronze
plate in the pavement of the ar
cades is now well established. And
these plates before us mark mile
stones in the history of Stanford.
The line is short; so is the history
of the University. Yet it has not
been without its dark side. There
was a period once, in which, beset
with doubt and uncertainty, it
seemed that the University must
fail. Yet in the face of this adver
sity, in the worst period of Stanford
history, when the doors were opened
fora new year, it was found that
307 young men and women had
confidence enough in Stanford to
entrust four years of the most crit
ical period of their lives to her
care.
No better tribute could be paid
to the University than to say that
such a number of students could be
found to enter at such a time. And
no better proof of the loyalty of the
Class of '99 to Stanford could be
had than the fact that it is composed
of those students.
Four years have passed since
then. In the meantime we have
seen our Alma Mater emerge from
the dark ages of its history. With
joy in our hearts we have seen it
enter upon a period of prosperity
and expansion. Though some of
us are opposed to expansion in its
latest signification, we unanimously
approve of it in this particular in
stance. We hope to see our Uni
versity mow and expand until its
influence sha'l become a factor, not
only in California, not only on the
Pacific Coast, not only in our own
country, but throughout the entire

world. We hope to see it become
largely instrumental in carrying
enlightenment and civilization to
the Far East, and to the Southern
Continent of America. And further
more, we hope to see it implant
some of the freshness and vigor of
its youth in the classic soils of Old
E u rope.
In the meantime it will make a
better citizenship and elevate the
standard of manhood at home. It
will, in the words of its founders,
"promote the public welfare by ex
ercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teaching
the blessings of liberty regulated
by law, and inculcating love and
reverence for the great principles
of government as derived from the
inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happi
ness."
Each class sent forth represents
so much Stanford influence in
jected into the social and industrial
system of our country, penetrating
to its utmost limits, just as every
throb of the heart sends the life
blood to every extremity of the
body.
•The Class of '99 is on the eve of
being thus sent forth into the
world to swell the ranks of Stan
ford alumni —let us hope not the
ranks of the unemployed. At any
raie we are about to take up the
responsibilities of life. And we
can assure those who are left be
hind and those who have gone be
fore that we shall use our best
endeavor to uphold the honor and
dignity of our Alma Mater.
In leaving the University we are
compelled to sever many ties and
connections that have grown dear
to us. We must part from many
of the best friends we have ever
known. We have become attached
to the University and its associ
ations. There is an indescribable
something that seems to hold us
here even when we would go. But
all these must be left behind.
Sometimes, perhaps, we may par
tially forget them. But there will
lie times when our minds will steal
back to the old place, and through
the golden haze of time memory
will paint on our vision these
poems of stone now about us. We
will think of the four years we have
spent under their influence; we will
think of the old Quad, of which we
are all so proud; we will recall
those nooks and corners which are
dear to us from association; and
finally, perhaps, our minds will
wander up the arcade to a certain
spot, before a then magnificent
chapel, which bears the inscription
" '99"—a1l that remains to remind
the students of those days that
there was a class of '99.
We are here now for the purpose
of dedicating to the University the
plate which bears that inscription.
We have come to the close of our
college course. We have had our
joys and our disappointments in
college life; but that is over now.
Before we leave that life we pause
to pay one more tribute to the Uni
versity; and in this, the last act of
the Class of ? 9!), present this plate
to our Alma, Mater as a token of
our gratitude and esteem.
Dr. Jordan, in the name of the
('lass of '99. 1 present you this
plate which is imbedded here as an
integral part of this grand old
quadrangle ; so the Class of '99
hopes to form an integral part of
that great structure that Stan
ford University is building in the
intelligence and manhood of our
I citizens, and we leave this plate in
j this structure as symbolical of our
part in the grander structure.
It hears but a small relation to
the many other squares that en
circle this quadrangle ; so we will
hear hut a small relation to the
greater edifice.
This is ihe fourth plate you have
stood here to receive, and no douht
as you look at each of them some
pleasant recollection of the class it
represents is brought to your mind.
May it he so in after years when
this plate, bearing the numerals '91),
shall greet your eye
We hope, for the sake of the
University, and for the sake of
higher education, that you will
stand here to receive many more of
these plates. For just in propor
tion as this line of bronze length
ens so will your influence, which
forms so large a part of Stanford
influence, go forth into the world.
Some day, perhaps, in the far dis
tant future, when this line of plates
shall haw crept slowly around (lie
arcades until it lias eneiicled the
entire quadrangle, an adequate
conception can he foin ed <>112 ihe
magnitude of that influence.
For the present, we of the Class
of '99 can only dedicate our plate
to Stanford University with the ut
most, gratitude for what she has
done for us, and with the earnest
hope that among the many that are
to follow ours shall not entirely he
forgotten. Oiias. S. Chanplkr.
The Class Day exercises, held in
the chapel, began promptly at hall
past ten on Monday morning. Al
most every hour on Monday car
ried with it some part ot the Class
Day festivities, but at no moment
from President Arnold's opening
speech in the morning to the last
waltz at the ball at night, did any
thing tend to break a lull round of
enjoyment.
The chapel was crowded with a
most appreciative audience, when
President Arnold delivered the ad
dress of welcome:
Friendtt and Fellow Students : —
It is my privilege and pleasure as
a representative of the Class of '99
to welcome you here this morning.
We are going to graduate, and we
want you to help us celebrate the
event this week. Although we are
few in number, no one will deny
that we are the Hnest class for our
size that has ever graduated from
Stanford University. Our class
historian will prove this to you a
little later.
Surely the saying that "a bad
beginning brings a good ending"
has been proven true in our case.
We came here when the very exist
ence of the University was in
doubt; we have passed through all
of the trying uncertainties attend
ant upon such a condition ; and,
now, as a reward we are permitted
to witness the beginning of a new
epoch in the history of Stanford
University that will make its name
stand tor one of the world's great
est institutions of learning.
Upon our graduation we will be
come part of an Alumni that has
already made itself felt in the busy
world outside, and it is our ambi
tion to add our mite to this influ
ence that already extends to the
very outskirts of civilization.
To those of our fellow students
who have gone or. before us, we ex
tend our thanks for the many little
helps they gave us when we were
Freshmen, and to the Class of '98
especially do we owe much for
teaching 11s that noblest trait in
human character, forbearance. The
Class of 1900 has also done its
share to impress us that i( patience
is a virtue" when we are sur
rounded by the intricacies of this
lite as well as when we are tied up
with baling rope.
We congratulate those who follow
us on theever widening possibilities
offered them by our Alma Mater,
and we hope that they may be
as ready to take advantage of these
possibilities as were the members
of the pioneer classes.
To our professors and instructors
we owe a debt of gratitude that can
never be repaid. Our patient
teachers in the class room and
laboratory, our genial companions
and ever helpful friends in our so
cial life, they have left upon our
characters an everlasting influence.
The final tribute of the Class of
'99 we offer to her whose loving de
votion and thoughtful care has en
abled us to receive such a benefi
cent education. It was she who
took the silver lining from thedark
cloud of litigation that hung on us
at our entrance here, and with it
has made possible that magnificieni
building wherein will be enacted
the closing scene of our college
career. To her all thanks !
Ralph Filcher, Class Historian,
then give the account of the haps
and mishaps that '99 found in hei
Jour years of undergraduate lit'-,

working the thread of his story
through a humorous introduction
to an impressive ending.
History of the '99 Class.
When the '99 Class entered the
University, perceiving that alto
gether too much attention had heen
paid to athletics, she cast 11 bout her
for some other Held wherein to
work. The intellectual Held was
comparatively unfilled and into
this rushed : 99 with energy and zeal
As a consequence soon the staff
of editors of the Daily Palo Alto
was increased three-fold and event
ually four mem hers of the class
dictated its editorial policy.
In the second year Josh was
started with a '99 man at its head,
and the third year the class tried
its hand at making an Annual. As
to the result of the latter work let
posterity judge whether any class
will excel it in this line.
Debating was next essayed and
our record of two men on each of
the regular Intercollegiate teams
for 1898 and 1899 stands as a monu
ment to our forensic ability.
However, while we were making
strides in intellectual lines, ath
letics also prospered, fora few of.
our men had declined the honors
of the pen and the forum and given
their best muscle, as well as brain, to
the maintenance of our athletic
si andard.
Of the record which those men
who took up athletics have made
we believe the University is proud.
Several examples of the rarest
athletic genius do we prize. John
Brunton, track captain for 1898, was
easily the best short distance man
that Stanford has had. Lewis
Freeman is the only Stanford man
who has won Varsity sweaters for
football, baseball, track, and tennis.
Captain Fisher of this year's eleven
sent his men through a season of
the greatest discouragement with
energy and determination and
never despaired until time was
called at the last of the second
half. Track Captain Smith has
combined athletics with literary
work and won for us the intercol
legiate mile record.
Five star football players and
worthy representatives on the dia
mond. track, and tennis court, are
we proud to claim. In addition to
the records of the individual men,
as evidence of the activity which
'99 stands for in athletic lines, the
work which has been done toward
securing that much needed institu
tion, a training-house, stands
boldly in the front.
Not least among the things of
which '99 is proud is the fact that
with her will graduate some of the
most famous men of t he U ni versity —
men who, though through mistake
did enter college with other classes,
have since seen the error of their
way and allied themselves with '99.
For their good taste —or that of the
faculty —the highest compliment is
flue.
Passing from our achievements
in various lines of endeavor, it may
be said in general that the gradua
tion of '99 marks an epoch in the
history of this University —connect-
ing link that the class is between
the future and the memories and
traditions of the past.
With the graduation of '99 there
leave college the last of those men
who have known and appreciated
the spirit of the pioneer, whose ac
quaintance has been intimate with
the men who made the present un
dergraduate life of Stiii ford what
it is, developed its traditions, its
pleasures, and its college spirit.
Later classes must turn to us to
I pa r 11 the legrt (1- of the Un i versi I y's
< hildhood. f<>r we are the bridge be

tween the infancy and the man
hood of the institution.
With the magnificent buildings
finished and those in contempla
tion, the University will henceforth
rank among the best equipped in the
world. The next generation ofclasses
will pass by the new Library, the
new Chapel, and the new Assembly
Hall. They will see the University
in its expanded glory, and they
will never be aware of an intenser
life that once centered around the
•'Old Quad."
But we will be the only class
that has known both the intimate
fellowship of the old University
and the larger life of the new, for
Wednesday the buildings of the
new Quad will be used in the first
Commencement exercises, for those
of '99.
But in a far deeper sense are we
the bridge between the old and the
new. Every arch in the Quad has
a meaning to us that no other class
can ever-know. We entered Stan
ford during her darkest hour
Others who come after us and share
in the great tide of prosperity may
know the affection that comes from
so great bounty. But only those
who have felt the hopes and
through which the founders had to
struggle, can ever experience such
deep personal love for these revered
arches as is shared by the mem
bers of '99. 11. E Filcher.
Following the annual custom,
J. Frank English, on behalf of '01,
presented the sophomore cane, with
all its privileges, to the Class of '02,
with the admonition that it should
stand up for all Sophomore prece
dents, and see to it that 1903 be al
lowed to carry the cane only on the
gaining of second year standing.
Professor Murray spoke the last
words for the faculty to the out
going class. His address follows:
As a college year draws to its
close different thoughts come to dif
ferent individuals, but there is a
universal feeling of satisfaction that
the year's work is over and that the
tension mav be relaxed fora time.
For tension there is in the serious
work of the year, and although
many a one doubtless feels that he
might have accomplished more than
he has, yet the large majority can
look back upon a period of earnest
effort.
When, therefore, the last exami
nation is past a change comes over
a college community ; spirits are
higher, hearts are buoyant. Work
is done for the time being at least,
and small wonder that many take
the first train for home, leaving new
friends, it may be, with a touch of
regret, but glad to rejoin the old
friends ; small wonder too that
many whose homes are near and
who have not that reason for leav
ing, still take gun and fishing rod
and flee to the woods, and that those
who remain avoid all Commence
ment festivities —at least all those at
which they must listen to any talk
ing. Have they not spent the last
eight or ten months in going from
one room in the quadrangle to an
other to listen to talking and lectur
ing, when it may be they would far
rather be somewhere else ? But
now a respite has come. And yet
those of you who are to be grad
uated on Wednesday next still
linger. Some even of your number
have left, but most of you are still
here, and this is your day, the day
of the Class of '99 It is a day of
good feeling ; you have squared ac
counts with your instructors and
now your diplomas are as good as
yours. You meet here to celebrate,

to have a good time with a glance
at the future and a glance at the
past ; with a good-humored sense
of satisfaction and contentment,
and, perhaps, a playtul recognition
of one another's feelings. And on
this, your own day, yon have
chosen to give one of the faculty a
chance at you.
Happily circumstanees are all on
your side. We are all in good
humor, and if you are tired of hear
ing lectures, we are also tired ol
giving them. We don't feel like
multiplying words, but, most of all,
like giving a shake of the hand and
a God-bless-you and turning each
his own way.
And yet even in the humor of a
class-day prophecy with its good
natured satire, even in your last
jokes about men and things that
have been familiar through these
years, there is another vein, not of
out and out sadness, but a vein of
deeper feeling. You leave us now ;
yes, you can snap your fingers at
us if you feel like it; but that is
just the point. I honestly be
lieve you don't feel like it.
True there is now and then in var
ious places a recrudescence of the
puerile view that faculty and stu
dents make up hostile camps; true
the old conception of a hard and
fast dividing line between the two
is not absolutely dead in some quar
ters; true again that in any col
lege community some must teach
and others must listen; but despite
all this a saner, wholesoiner view
prevails with us. Our way of look
ing at such things, is that we have
been a body of good friends, work
iug together for common ends —
ends that are not for self alone, but
for one another. We have loved to
call this the Stanford spirit, hon
estly believing that it prevails here
more than in most, if not all of our
sister institutions; and we are jeal
ous of it. If on your part you have
seen —as I hope you have not —
any indications of a lessening of
this freedom of intercourse, of this
friendliness among the members of
our community, let it be a part of
your duty, as you join the ranks of
the alumni, to make your influence
tell against any such forces. This
is perhaps our strongest, our most
cherished tradition. And you can
do this the more easily inasmuch
as you cease now to be Stanford
students only to become in another
sense co-operators with us. Retain
your loyalty, retain and cherish
this healthful spirit that obtains
among us, and each year shall see
a strengthening of the ties that bind
us all together.
We lead busy lives here, intense
lives, but not warped or cramped
lives. The old scholastic ideal of a
quiet cell where the recluse could
withdraw from the world to pore
over musty tomes and wear his life
out in study, does not fit our large
view of life. We cherish all that
the past has learned of truth in
every line of human thought, and
we honor all who have added any
thing, however small, to the stock
of the world's knowledge; but in
our view this earnest, restless
search for truth goes hand in hand
with a recognition of the fact that
there are others about us striving
in their way to attain to the same
goal, and we like to put shoulder to
shoulder and work together.
Have you found much pedantry
here? much parade of learning?
Have you not rather found that
scholarship is put above learning,
and that one is tolerant of another,
not belittling his work but glad to
believe that the line ot work he has
chosen is the best for him ? This
is another manifestation ol the
same spirit, and this large tolerance
we cherish too. It prevents our
lives from being narrow, or from
seeming narrow to one another,
even when one may not be in a
position to appreciate another's
work. We credit one another with
being men and women with large
views and high ideals, men and
women to whom life is very real and
very rich—who touch what is liv
ing and what is vital in their work.
Now am I wrong in feeling that
you carry away these views with
you? I trust not, for these things
are worth holding fast. We who
remain cherish them, hold them to
be not only true, but the most strik
ing characteristics of our life here,
and in maintaining these things you
can help us. Few, if any, of you
sever absolutely your connection
with Stanford and her foster chil
dren; none of you, I am sure, go
forth without a loyal pride in our
University. As alumni and alumnae
you can aid in fostering these tilings
often more effectively than we can
do it ourselves. And to foster these
is to work against all tendencies you
may have seen in your college life
that make against this frank and
friendly and sympathetic spirit
which we hold to be ours. It mat
ters not where these things have
cropped out; it may have been in
college politics, it may have been
in social life shown by a tendency
toward snobbishness, it may have
been in fraternity life, or again in
athletics. Take the last as an in
stance; we are proud of our record —
not this year of our victories, al
though that matters but little, but
proud to think that our athletics
have in the main been exceptionally
clean. Here, if undergraduate zeal
runs beyond judgment, we need a
strong sentiment 011 the part of the
alumni. Neither you nor we want
any man brought here for athletics'
sake, because he will help us in
football or 011 the track, even if the
letter of the law governing college
athletics be not infringed in bring
ing him. We want more of sport
for sport's sake, and less of sport
for the sake of winning, and we
want every position 011 every team
to be open to any man in college
who shall prove himself the best
man, regardless of position or of
affiliations.
For we are a democracy, and re
joice in equal opportunities for all
equal opportunities in the classroom,
011 the field, and in social relations.
We believe in worth, and in worth
alone, and jealously guard as open
to all, all that our University life of
fers, holding that, in the long run,
worth prevails.
Now I have done. Pardon me
if 011 your own day I have imposed
011 your courtesv and nreached to
you once more Doubtless you feel
that of all this you have had enough
and more than enough; but take
this not as a parting shot, but as a
friendly word of farewell. You go
your separate ways, but you are
still ours. We claim your interest
and your help, desiring nothing so
much as that the things that char
acterize our life here be not things
that are petty and trivial, but things
that are true, honorable, and just,
pure, lovely, and of good report.
The last will and testament of the
class, which had been drawn up by
the leading legal lights of '99, was
read by Mr. Suzzallo:
To all to whom these presents may
come, In this wide and spacious
principality of Stanford University,
of the county of Santa Clara, and
the State of California, presided over
and governed by his most high and
maguificent mightiness, David Starr

Jordan, and his worthy co-dignitary
in domestic management, that re
nowned and undaunted knight,
Chas. Hrnest Schwartz.

A. H Suzzallo.
After the close of the exercises in
the chapel, the audience immedi
ately assembled before the portico
of the new chapel, where the cere
monies attendant 011 the dedication
of the '99 bronze tablet were held.
C. S. Chandler, for '99, presented
the plate to the University, Dr. Jor
dan accepting it. These ceremon
ies were closed by the singing of
" Hail, Stanford, Hail ! "
We are assembled here today for
the purpose of adding one more
monument to Stanford University.
The custom of the Senior Class to
dedicate to the University a hronze
plate in the pavement of the ar
cades is now well established. And
these plates before us mark mile
stones in the history of Stanford.
The line is short; so is the history
of the University. Yet it has not
been without its dark side. There
was a period once, in which, beset
with doubt and uncertainty, it
seemed that the University must
fail. Yet in the face of this adver
sity, in the worst period of Stanford
history, when the doors were opened
fora new year, it was found that
307 young men and women had
confidence enough in Stanford to
entrust four years of the most crit
ical period of their lives to her
care.
No better tribute could be paid
to the University than to say that
such a number of students could be
found to enter at such a time. And
no better proof of the loyalty of the
Class of '99 to Stanford could be
had than the fact that it is composed
of those students.
Four years have passed since
then. In the meantime we have
seen our Alma Mater emerge from
the dark ages of its history. With
joy in our hearts we have seen it
enter upon a period of prosperity
and expansion. Though some of
us are opposed to expansion in its
latest signification, we unanimously
approve of it in this particular in
stance. We hope to see our Uni
versity mow and expand until its
influence sha'l become a factor, not
only in California, not only on the
Pacific Coast, not only in our own
country, but throughout the entire

world. We hope to see it become
largely instrumental in carrying
enlightenment and civilization to
the Far East, and to the Southern
Continent of America. And further
more, we hope to see it implant
some of the freshness and vigor of
its youth in the classic soils of Old
E u rope.
In the meantime it will make a
better citizenship and elevate the
standard of manhood at home. It
will, in the words of its founders,
"promote the public welfare by ex
ercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teaching
the blessings of liberty regulated
by law, and inculcating love and
reverence for the great principles
of government as derived from the
inalienable rights of man to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happi
ness."
Each class sent forth represents
so much Stanford influence in
jected into the social and industrial
system of our country, penetrating
to its utmost limits, just as every
throb of the heart sends the life
blood to every extremity of the
body.
•The Class of '99 is on the eve of
being thus sent forth into the
world to swell the ranks of Stan
ford alumni —let us hope not the
ranks of the unemployed. At any
raie we are about to take up the
responsibilities of life. And we
can assure those who are left be
hind and those who have gone be
fore that we shall use our best
endeavor to uphold the honor and
dignity of our Alma Mater.
In leaving the University we are
compelled to sever many ties and
connections that have grown dear
to us. We must part from many
of the best friends we have ever
known. We have become attached
to the University and its associ
ations. There is an indescribable
something that seems to hold us
here even when we would go. But
all these must be left behind.
Sometimes, perhaps, we may par
tially forget them. But there will
lie times when our minds will steal
back to the old place, and through
the golden haze of time memory
will paint on our vision these
poems of stone now about us. We
will think of the four years we have
spent under their influence; we will
think of the old Quad, of which we
are all so proud; we will recall
those nooks and corners which are
dear to us from association; and
finally, perhaps, our minds will
wander up the arcade to a certain
spot, before a then magnificent
chapel, which bears the inscription
" '99"—a1l that remains to remind
the students of those days that
there was a class of '99.
We are here now for the purpose
of dedicating to the University the
plate which bears that inscription.
We have come to the close of our
college course. We have had our
joys and our disappointments in
college life; but that is over now.
Before we leave that life we pause
to pay one more tribute to the Uni
versity; and in this, the last act of
the Class of ? 9!), present this plate
to our Alma, Mater as a token of
our gratitude and esteem.
Dr. Jordan, in the name of the
('lass of '99. 1 present you this
plate which is imbedded here as an
integral part of this grand old
quadrangle ; so the Class of '99
hopes to form an integral part of
that great structure that Stan
ford University is building in the
intelligence and manhood of our
I citizens, and we leave this plate in
j this structure as symbolical of our
part in the grander structure.
It hears but a small relation to
the many other squares that en
circle this quadrangle ; so we will
hear hut a small relation to the
greater edifice.
This is ihe fourth plate you have
stood here to receive, and no douht
as you look at each of them some
pleasant recollection of the class it
represents is brought to your mind.
May it he so in after years when
this plate, bearing the numerals '91),
shall greet your eye
We hope, for the sake of the
University, and for the sake of
higher education, that you will
stand here to receive many more of
these plates. For just in propor
tion as this line of bronze length
ens so will your influence, which
forms so large a part of Stanford
influence, go forth into the world.
Some day, perhaps, in the far dis
tant future, when this line of plates
shall haw crept slowly around (lie
arcades until it lias eneiicled the
entire quadrangle, an adequate
conception can he foin ed <>112 ihe
magnitude of that influence.
For the present, we of the Class
of '99 can only dedicate our plate
to Stanford University with the ut
most, gratitude for what she has
done for us, and with the earnest
hope that among the many that are
to follow ours shall not entirely he
forgotten. Oiias. S. Chanplkr.
