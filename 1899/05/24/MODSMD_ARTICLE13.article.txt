# CLASS DAY EXERCISES.
## An Account of the Various Events of the Day with the Addresses. 
### 
The Class Day exercises, held in
the chapel, began promptly at hall
past ten on Monday morning. Al
most every hour on Monday car
ried with it some part ot the Class
Day festivities, but at no moment
from President Arnold's opening
speech in the morning to the last
waltz at the ball at night, did any
thing tend to break a lull round of
enjoyment.
The chapel was crowded with a
most appreciative audience, when
President Arnold delivered the ad
dress of welcome:
Friendtt and Fellow Students : —
It is my privilege and pleasure as
a representative of the Class of '99
to welcome you here this morning.
We are going to graduate, and we
want you to help us celebrate the
event this week. Although we are
few in number, no one will deny
that we are the Hnest class for our
size that has ever graduated from
Stanford University. Our class
historian will prove this to you a
little later.
Surely the saying that "a bad
beginning brings a good ending"
has been proven true in our case.
We came here when the very exist
ence of the University was in
doubt; we have passed through all
of the trying uncertainties attend
ant upon such a condition ; and,
now, as a reward we are permitted
to witness the beginning of a new
epoch in the history of Stanford
University that will make its name
stand tor one of the world's great
est institutions of learning.
Upon our graduation we will be
come part of an Alumni that has
already made itself felt in the busy
world outside, and it is our ambi
tion to add our mite to this influ
ence that already extends to the
very outskirts of civilization.
To those of our fellow students
who have gone or. before us, we ex
tend our thanks for the many little
helps they gave us when we were
Freshmen, and to the Class of '98
especially do we owe much for
teaching 11s that noblest trait in
human character, forbearance. The
Class of 1900 has also done its
share to impress us that i( patience
is a virtue" when we are sur
rounded by the intricacies of this
lite as well as when we are tied up
with baling rope.
We congratulate those who follow
us on theever widening possibilities
offered them by our Alma Mater,
and we hope that they may be
as ready to take advantage of these
possibilities as were the members
of the pioneer classes.
To our professors and instructors
we owe a debt of gratitude that can
never be repaid. Our patient
teachers in the class room and
laboratory, our genial companions
and ever helpful friends in our so
cial life, they have left upon our
characters an everlasting influence.
The final tribute of the Class of
'99 we offer to her whose loving de
votion and thoughtful care has en
abled us to receive such a benefi
cent education. It was she who
took the silver lining from thedark
cloud of litigation that hung on us
at our entrance here, and with it
has made possible that magnificieni
building wherein will be enacted
the closing scene of our college
career. To her all thanks !
Ralph Filcher, Class Historian,
then give the account of the haps
and mishaps that '99 found in hei
Jour years of undergraduate lit'-,

working the thread of his story
through a humorous introduction
to an impressive ending.
History of the '99 Class.
When the '99 Class entered the
University, perceiving that alto
gether too much attention had heen
paid to athletics, she cast 11 bout her
for some other Held wherein to
work. The intellectual Held was
comparatively unfilled and into
this rushed : 99 with energy and zeal
As a consequence soon the staff
of editors of the Daily Palo Alto
was increased three-fold and event
ually four mem hers of the class
dictated its editorial policy.
In the second year Josh was
started with a '99 man at its head,
and the third year the class tried
its hand at making an Annual. As
to the result of the latter work let
posterity judge whether any class
will excel it in this line.
Debating was next essayed and
our record of two men on each of
the regular Intercollegiate teams
for 1898 and 1899 stands as a monu
ment to our forensic ability.
However, while we were making
strides in intellectual lines, ath
letics also prospered, fora few of.
our men had declined the honors
of the pen and the forum and given
their best muscle, as well as brain, to
the maintenance of our athletic
si andard.
Of the record which those men
who took up athletics have made
we believe the University is proud.
Several examples of the rarest
athletic genius do we prize. John
Brunton, track captain for 1898, was
easily the best short distance man
that Stanford has had. Lewis
Freeman is the only Stanford man
who has won Varsity sweaters for
football, baseball, track, and tennis.
Captain Fisher of this year's eleven
sent his men through a season of
the greatest discouragement with
energy and determination and
never despaired until time was
called at the last of the second
half. Track Captain Smith has
combined athletics with literary
work and won for us the intercol
legiate mile record.
Five star football players and
worthy representatives on the dia
mond. track, and tennis court, are
we proud to claim. In addition to
the records of the individual men,
as evidence of the activity which
'99 stands for in athletic lines, the
work which has been done toward
securing that much needed institu
tion, a training-house, stands
boldly in the front.
Not least among the things of
which '99 is proud is the fact that
with her will graduate some of the
most famous men of t he U ni versity —
men who, though through mistake
did enter college with other classes,
have since seen the error of their
way and allied themselves with '99.
For their good taste —or that of the
faculty —the highest compliment is
flue.
Passing from our achievements
in various lines of endeavor, it may
be said in general that the gradua
tion of '99 marks an epoch in the
history of this University —connect-
ing link that the class is between
the future and the memories and
traditions of the past.
With the graduation of '99 there
leave college the last of those men
who have known and appreciated
the spirit of the pioneer, whose ac
quaintance has been intimate with
the men who made the present un
dergraduate life of Stiii ford what
it is, developed its traditions, its
pleasures, and its college spirit.
Later classes must turn to us to
I pa r 11 the legrt (1- of the Un i versi I y's
< hildhood. f<>r we are the bridge be

tween the infancy and the man
hood of the institution.
With the magnificent buildings
finished and those in contempla
tion, the University will henceforth
rank among the best equipped in the
world. The next generation ofclasses
will pass by the new Library, the
new Chapel, and the new Assembly
Hall. They will see the University
in its expanded glory, and they
will never be aware of an intenser
life that once centered around the
•'Old Quad."
But we will be the only class
that has known both the intimate
fellowship of the old University
and the larger life of the new, for
Wednesday the buildings of the
new Quad will be used in the first
Commencement exercises, for those
of '99.
But in a far deeper sense are we
the bridge between the old and the
new. Every arch in the Quad has
a meaning to us that no other class
can ever-know. We entered Stan
ford during her darkest hour
Others who come after us and share
in the great tide of prosperity may
know the affection that comes from
so great bounty. But only those
who have felt the hopes and
through which the founders had to
struggle, can ever experience such
deep personal love for these revered
arches as is shared by the mem
bers of '99. 11. E Filcher.
Following the annual custom,
J. Frank English, on behalf of '01,
presented the sophomore cane, with
all its privileges, to the Class of '02,
with the admonition that it should
stand up for all Sophomore prece
dents, and see to it that 1903 be al
lowed to carry the cane only on the
gaining of second year standing.
Professor Murray spoke the last
words for the faculty to the out
going class. His address follows:
As a college year draws to its
close different thoughts come to dif
ferent individuals, but there is a
universal feeling of satisfaction that
the year's work is over and that the
tension mav be relaxed fora time.
For tension there is in the serious
work of the year, and although
many a one doubtless feels that he
might have accomplished more than
he has, yet the large majority can
look back upon a period of earnest
effort.
When, therefore, the last exami
nation is past a change comes over
a college community ; spirits are
higher, hearts are buoyant. Work
is done for the time being at least,
and small wonder that many take
the first train for home, leaving new
friends, it may be, with a touch of
regret, but glad to rejoin the old
friends ; small wonder too that
many whose homes are near and
who have not that reason for leav
ing, still take gun and fishing rod
and flee to the woods, and that those
who remain avoid all Commence
ment festivities —at least all those at
which they must listen to any talk
ing. Have they not spent the last
eight or ten months in going from
one room in the quadrangle to an
other to listen to talking and lectur
ing, when it may be they would far
rather be somewhere else ? But
now a respite has come. And yet
those of you who are to be grad
uated on Wednesday next still
linger. Some even of your number
have left, but most of you are still
here, and this is your day, the day
of the Class of '99 It is a day of
good feeling ; you have squared ac
counts with your instructors and
now your diplomas are as good as
yours. You meet here to celebrate,

to have a good time with a glance
at the future and a glance at the
past ; with a good-humored sense
of satisfaction and contentment,
and, perhaps, a playtul recognition
of one another's feelings. And on
this, your own day, yon have
chosen to give one of the faculty a
chance at you.
Happily circumstanees are all on
your side. We are all in good
humor, and if you are tired of hear
ing lectures, we are also tired ol
giving them. We don't feel like
multiplying words, but, most of all,
like giving a shake of the hand and
a God-bless-you and turning each
his own way.
And yet even in the humor of a
class-day prophecy with its good
natured satire, even in your last
jokes about men and things that
have been familiar through these
years, there is another vein, not of
out and out sadness, but a vein of
deeper feeling. You leave us now ;
yes, you can snap your fingers at
us if you feel like it; but that is
just the point. I honestly be
lieve you don't feel like it.
True there is now and then in var
ious places a recrudescence of the
puerile view that faculty and stu
dents make up hostile camps; true
the old conception of a hard and
fast dividing line between the two
is not absolutely dead in some quar
ters; true again that in any col
lege community some must teach
and others must listen; but despite
all this a saner, wholesoiner view
prevails with us. Our way of look
ing at such things, is that we have
been a body of good friends, work
iug together for common ends —
ends that are not for self alone, but
for one another. We have loved to
call this the Stanford spirit, hon
estly believing that it prevails here
more than in most, if not all of our
sister institutions; and we are jeal
ous of it. If on your part you have
seen —as I hope you have not —
any indications of a lessening of
this freedom of intercourse, of this
friendliness among the members of
our community, let it be a part of
your duty, as you join the ranks of
the alumni, to make your influence
tell against any such forces. This
is perhaps our strongest, our most
cherished tradition. And you can
do this the more easily inasmuch
as you cease now to be Stanford
students only to become in another
sense co-operators with us. Retain
your loyalty, retain and cherish
this healthful spirit that obtains
among us, and each year shall see
a strengthening of the ties that bind
us all together.
We lead busy lives here, intense
lives, but not warped or cramped
lives. The old scholastic ideal of a
quiet cell where the recluse could
withdraw from the world to pore
over musty tomes and wear his life
out in study, does not fit our large
view of life. We cherish all that
the past has learned of truth in
every line of human thought, and
we honor all who have added any
thing, however small, to the stock
of the world's knowledge; but in
our view this earnest, restless
search for truth goes hand in hand
with a recognition of the fact that
there are others about us striving
in their way to attain to the same
goal, and we like to put shoulder to
shoulder and work together.
Have you found much pedantry
here? much parade of learning?
Have you not rather found that
scholarship is put above learning,
and that one is tolerant of another,
not belittling his work but glad to
believe that the line ot work he has
chosen is the best for him ? This
is another manifestation ol the
