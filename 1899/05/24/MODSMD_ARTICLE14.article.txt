# Ivy Planting.
## 
### 
The graduating claws this yeat
transferred the planting of the ivy
from the All Saints' church in Palo
Alto, where it has heen heretofore
the custom to hold the ceremony,
to the college buildings. The '91)
ivy was planted by that portion of
the University chapel which is com
pleted. The exercises began with
singing "From Duty unto Glory,"
followed by prayer by Rev. Charles
R. Brown.
Bishop Nichols spoke nexr, point
ing out the difference of this ivy
climbing on recently piled new-cut
stone and the usual climbing place
or ivy, crumbling ruins. Ivy gen
erally veils the work of time; this
one is to be an ornament to a new
structure. After a short address
to the class by President Jordan
and singing "America,"the ivy was
planted by Ralph Arnold, presidt nt
of the class, and Milnor Roberts,
chairman of the Ivy Committee.
A quartet sang a song dunn , _ , th»-
planting of the ivy, written t• \
George Her be 11 Yost t<> the air«>i
Mendelssohn's "Consolatn n."
The ceremony was closed by the
singing of the Ivy Hymn, also writ
ten by Yost.
The two songs are as follows:
IVY PLANTING.
Type of true friendship more close
knit forever,
Fondly we think of thy fostering
prime,—
Though from the home of our heart
we must sever.
Here, sacred Ivy, we leave thee
to climb.
Dear are the faces that greet thee
and bless thee,
Where we were fostered and fa
vored as thou, —
Wild tire the breezes that blow to
caress thee,
Bright are the heavens that over
thee bow.
Grow to the pride of thy beauty
and power,
Guarding the home that no age
may deform, —
Spread thy warm mat.tie o'er cor
nice and tower,
Bind firm the walls 'gainst the
centuries' storm I

(jrovv on unchangeable, grow to
completeness,
As she that shelters thee blessings
bestow, —
llirds seek thy berries and bees sip
thy sweetness;
All sing io bless thee as parting
they go!
IVY HYMN.
Full-armored in new trust of life,
| Go we where duty calls,
And hope to triumph in the strife
That waits beyond the walls.
To witi the victor's ivy crown,
Stanford, we pledge this sign,
And by our labors thy renown
Shall grow as grows the vine.
It ever climbs, as we aspire,
To reach a height untold,
And burning with an inborn fire,
It fears no shade nor cold;
No hardship and no height it fears,
Hul gains the battlement,
Ai d there its flowery standard rears
And pines for new ascent.
Full armored in new trust of life,
i We go where duty calls,
And hope to triumph in the strife
That waits beyond thy walls.
George Herbert Yost.
