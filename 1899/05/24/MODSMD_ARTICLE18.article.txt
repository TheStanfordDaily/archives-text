President Jordan's toast, ' Tin-

i good many of his plans, not only
t«>r new buildings but for new de
partments, new professors,and gen
erally improved equipments and
facilities in every direction. He
-aid that by the sale of some prop
erty recently Mrs. Stanford hat
neen aMe to put a larger amount
• I money into the University than
formerly. This is indicated by the
large amount of building now going
on.
in speaking of the changes in
departments Dr. Jordan touched
upon the relative number of men
and women in the University and
of the fear felt by some that ihe
percentage of women was increas
ing too fast ami the number of men
falling off. lie said that if the
>ixty men in Manila were in col
lege the proportions would be nor
mal However it is true that the
departments which draw largely
from the women of the University
are stronger than those attended
principally by men. These latter
will be strengthened, particularly
Law and the Engineering course.
Dr. Jordan ran through the
various new appointments in the
facility for next year.
