# "THE VOICE OF THE SCHOLAR."
## Address to the Graduating Class by President David Starr Jordan. 
### 
The degree you have earned is a
badge of admission to the noblest
fraternity we know, the brother
hood of scholars. Jt is a badge
only, not giving you a seat at the
banquet nor the benefit of any doubt
should your right to remain ever be
questioned. Tht power to hold
your own must lie within your
selves. You must show your own
mettle and stand by your own tests.
As you go out from us you take the
scholar's place among the people
You represent the university in the
midst of democracy. It is for you
to bring university and democracy
together. For the greatest need of
popular governnnlit is the univer
sity. The greatest need of higher
education is democracy. The
scholar and the man must stand to
gether, must work together, must
abide together. It is not the
necessary function of democracy
to do anything very well. Its
purpose is to develop intelli
gence and patriotism through mak
ing the people do for themselves all
things possible which concern tlieni,
individually or collectively. To
throw responsibility upon men is
the surest way to make them rise
to responsibility. But courage aim
willingness do not guarantee stu
cess. Exact knowledge and thor
ough training are necessary to
right results. Government by
the people needs its trained and
educated men more than any other
kind of government, for while
monarchy seeks far and wide for
wise men and strong men to be
usedasits tools, strength and wis
dom is the daily life of successful
democracy. But deniociacy is
always prone to undervalue wise
men and imagines vainly that it can
get along well enough without their
help.
On the other hand the university
needs the people. In their wants
and their uplifting it finds ihe best
reason for its existence. " The
bath of the people," which Lincoln
said was good for public men is
essential to the university. It keeps
it in touch with life. It holds it to
humanity.
Those who regard higher educa
tion as a social ornament, valueless
except as a badge for the delight of
its possessor, and those who regard
culture as the private perquisite of
the elect few, are alike in the wrong.
The presence of men of culture and
training raises the value of every
thing about them. It ensures the
success of enterprise, the safety of
person and property, the contact
with righteousness of thought and
action which is the mainspring of
right thought and right deed in the
future.
Moreover, if clear thinking with
clean living is good lor the elect
few it is equally good for the
mutable many. Culture not only
raises a man above the mass, it
turns the masses into men. That
the multitude may imagine them
selves men before they hold a man's
grasj) on life is the grievous danger
of democracy. Here again the uni
versity plays its part, teaching the
relative value of ideals. Under its
criticism men learn that good re
sults are better than good inten
tions and that they demand a far
higher order of skill and courage.
1 heard a public man say the
other day that the university men
were not on his side of a certain
question. In fact, he said, the col
lege men arealwayson the contrary
side on every question. This is
nrobably true in the sense he

me#nt, for it is the province of col
lege men to judge intentions and
pretenses by ulliniate results.
When the tinal end is sure to he
had, according to the experience of
human wisdom, wise men must op
pose the beginning. The univer
sities have many times stood in op
position to the popular feeling of
the time, hut they have never found
their condemnation in the final
verdict of history. Only he who
has studied the affairs of men crit
ically, impartially, coldly, can dis
cover the real trend of forces in the
movements of today. This the
university has means to do. It
does not carry elections, in fact it
has seldom tried to do so, for the
results of an election play a very
.-mall part in the evolution of dem
ocracy ; not to carry elections but
rather to carry the people: that is
something worth doing. The words
of experience which are lost in
the noise of the hustings become
potent as the tumult passes by.
The people suffer many ills in
our social order, tor most of which
they only are responsible. , Be
cause men are not v\ise they know
not what to do. In ignorance and
weakness, they find themselves the
sport of fate, the flotsam of destiny,
ihe victims of evils that wisdom
and virtue instinctively avoid.
Next to knowing what to do is
the willingness 10 believe that son.e
one else possesses this knowledge.
6cepiicistu us to the existence 01
skill and intolerance toward the
possessor of knowledge are common
features of democracy. This is its
vulgar side, the disposition to do
mean things in a mean way, doubt
ing that there exist any better
things or any better ways of doing
them. Through this kind of vul
gaiity the average American is his
own physician, healing himself
with drugs (112 which he does not
know even the name. As a re
sult he suffers half his life
from self-inflicted poisoning. The
American is his own architect, and
for this reason oui cities are tilled
with buildings in which nightmares
might house, were it not for their
Iresh paint and .-mart ornamenta
tion. r l he American is his own
statesman, following his own im
pulses, guided by his own preju
dices. Thus he tills the land of the
free with oppression and injustice.
When he can no longer shut his
eyes to the misery be has wrought
befalls back on his good intentions
and lays the blame for his blunders
on destiny. The sense of personal
responsibility and personal ade
quacy which democracy gives is of
vital importance in the develop
ment of man. But it has its bad
side as well as its good. It is the
function of the university to strug
gle against the bad, day and night,
in season and out of season, to con
vert it into the other. That vul
garity is free to express itself in our
system does not exalt vulgarity. In
the long run in freedom vulgarity
linds its surest cure.
The people at large do not
understand nor value knowl
edge and power. Only those who
know well and see clearly can do
well. Knowledge does not flatter
nor coddle and men take to that
which plea-es ihem. The fact that
the majority do not believe in
know bilge is the reason why ihe
university must always lie in op
position to prevailing sentiment
and current action. 'â€¢ When were 1 lie
yood a i id t rue ever in the majority V"
I here are not many of those who
speak and write on public affairs
who really care for what is true
or for what is just. The interest, of
most men lies in the success oi the

"cause." But the "cause," what
ever it may be, is only an incident
in intellectual awakening, a mere
episode in social development. It is
in the actual truth that the public
weal is bound up. Mo honest or
worthy cause appeals to the self
pity oi those it addresses. All calls
to the weakness or vanity or preju
dice or passion of men are dishon
est. All dishonesty results in evil.
Virtue that can last rests on grow
ing honesty and growing wisdom.
Because the university stands lor
the frte search tor truth, its influ
ence must be opposed to that oi
passion and prejudice. It must be
above the heats of the hour and
therefore in some degree opposed to
them. Thus those who survive on
the sands of the arena find the uni
versity distant and cold. This
again is its danger, that it should
be distant and cold. .Never to "vex
at the land's ridiculous miserie"
was an old ideal of the university.
It is an ideal long cherished in the
great universities ot England. But
it was never a worthy ideal, lo
exist for the needs of the people is
a mission worthy of Oxford or Har
vard or Berlin. It is the tinal high
est funtion of ail theglorious broth
erhood of plain lite and high
thought. '1 o keep up wisdom
among men is the natural function
oi the university. 1 he need of tin
limes is not of men to die for the
right, but ot men to live tor it; noi
ot men to oppose popular feeling
nor even to arouse the public con
science. Better than this is to train
the public thought. What we want
is not a revival of zeal, even for the
cause of righteousness. It is rather
a revival of wisdom. 'Ibis is fol
lowed by no chill nor backsliding,
while zeal, however well meaning,
is subject to ebbs and flows.
I heard a very rich man say not
long ago that he had no faith in
higher education. "Mine college
men out of every ten," he said,
"build up a wall between them
selves and life." By lite, be seemed
to mean the business of making
money. If this be life, the state
ment may be true, but even judged
by this standard, we must believe
that it was an inferior kind of col
lege men who thrust themselves
upon his notice. Some people look
upon men as useful only when they
can use them. The rest are merely
competing organisms, poor beggars
who ought to be got under ground
as soon as possible, to save the costs
of their keep. But it is not trui
that most college men build up a
wall between themselves and life.
It this is true in any individual
case, it is because the man was
not worth educating or because I lit
education was itself spurious. For
higher education can not make a
man where manhood did not exist
before. It can only take a man
already created and raise him to
higher effectiveness. Moreover,
there are frauds and imitations in
education as well as anywhere else
and misfit articles are thrown on
the market, cheap, every day. It
is said that ''our schools which
teach young people how to talk do
not teach tlieni how to live." It
this is true, it means that some
schools are shams, not giving real
education. But it is not by mis
takes and misfits that higher edu
cation is to be judged. It is by its
finished and adapted product. In
every walk in iite the higher educa
tion works to the benefit "i human
ity. The man who knows one
thing well can do it well. His presence
|ence in life is a help to his neigh
bor. He does not enter into com
petition but into elevation, lie
makes the business of living respect

able. in a Witfit magazine, Dr.
William He Witt Hyde gives a
stiiking account of the value of the
life work of a single scholar, the
honored President of Harvard:
"No one can begin to measure the
gain to civilization and human
happiness his services have wrought.
His leadership lias doubled the
rate of educational advance not in
Harvard alone but throughout the
United States. He has sought to
! extend the helping hand of sjni
paihy and appreciation to every
! struggling capacity in the humblest
grammar grade; to stimulate it into
j joyous blossoming under the sun
shine of congenial studies through
out the secondary years; to bring it
ito a sturdy and sound maturity in
the atmosphere of liberty in college
life; and finally, by stern selection
and thorough specialization, to
gather a harvest of experts in all
the higher walks of lile, on whose
skill, knowledge, integrity,and self
sacrilice their less trained fellows
can implicitly rely for higher in
struction, professional counsel, and
| public leadership. In consequence
lof these comprehensive reiorms,
Iwe see the lirst beginnings of a
j lational and universal church,
not separate lrom existing sects,
| but permeating all; property
j lights m all their subtle tonus are
i more secuie and well defined; hun
| dreds of persons are alive today
j who under physicians of interior
training would have died long ago;
thousands of college students have
had quickened within them a keen
intellectual interest, and earnest
spiritual purpose, a 'personal power
in action under responsibility,' who
under the old regime would have
remained listless and indifferent;
tens of thousands of boys and gills
lin secondary schools can expand
their hearts and minds with science
and history and the languages of
other lands, who but for President
Eliot would have been doomed to
the monotonous treadmill of loimal
studies for which they have no
aptitude or taste; and, as years go
l>y, hundreds of thousands of ttie
children of the poor, in the precious
tender years before their dralting
into lives of drudgery and toil, in
place of the dry husks ot superflu
ous arithmetic, the thrice-thrashed
straw of unessential grammar, and
the innutritions shells of unremem
berable geographical details, will
get some briel glimpse of the won
drous loveliness of nature and her
laws, some sliuht touch of inspira
tion from the words and deeds of
ihe world's wisest and bravest men,
io carry with them as a heritage to
brighten their luture humble homes
and gladden all their after lives.
"In such 'good measure, pressed
down, shaken together, running
over/ has there been given to this
great educational reformer, in re
turn for thirty years of generous and
steadfast service of his university,
his fellow men, his country, and
his (iod, what, in true Puritan sim
plicity, he calls, 'that finest luxury,
to do some perpetual good in this
world.'"
Not long since one of our writers
expressed regret at the numbers of
young men sent forth each year to
swell the educated proletariat of
America. His assumption is that
each is to scramble for his living,
struggling with his competitors,
dissatisfied because his ambitions
iar outrun every possible achieve
ment. The very reverse of this is
the fact in America, whatever may
be the case elsewhere, as amidst
'' ihe bidridden officialism of
France.'' The man of char
acter who is educated aright
finds very soon his levei in our
