# "THE VOICE OF THE SCHOLAR."
## Address to the Graduating Class by President David Starr Jordan. 
### 
The degree you have earned is a
badge of admission to the noblest
fraternity we know, the brother
hood of scholars. Jt is a badge
only, not giving you a seat at the
banquet nor the benefit of any doubt
should your right to remain ever be
questioned. Tht power to hold
your own must lie within your
selves. You must show your own
mettle and stand by your own tests.
As you go out from us you take the
scholar's place among the people
You represent the university in the
midst of democracy. It is for you
to bring university and democracy
together. For the greatest need of
popular governnnlit is the univer
sity. The greatest need of higher
education is democracy. The
scholar and the man must stand to
gether, must work together, must
abide together. It is not the
necessary function of democracy
to do anything very well. Its
purpose is to develop intelli
gence and patriotism through mak
ing the people do for themselves all
things possible which concern tlieni,
individually or collectively. To
throw responsibility upon men is
the surest way to make them rise
to responsibility. But courage aim
willingness do not guarantee stu
cess. Exact knowledge and thor
ough training are necessary to
right results. Government by
the people needs its trained and
educated men more than any other
kind of government, for while
monarchy seeks far and wide for
wise men and strong men to be
usedasits tools, strength and wis
dom is the daily life of successful
democracy. But deniociacy is
always prone to undervalue wise
men and imagines vainly that it can
get along well enough without their
help.
On the other hand the university
needs the people. In their wants
and their uplifting it finds ihe best
reason for its existence. " The
bath of the people," which Lincoln
said was good for public men is
essential to the university. It keeps
it in touch with life. It holds it to
humanity.
Those who regard higher educa
tion as a social ornament, valueless
except as a badge for the delight of
its possessor, and those who regard
culture as the private perquisite of
the elect few, are alike in the wrong.
The presence of men of culture and
training raises the value of every
thing about them. It ensures the
success of enterprise, the safety of
person and property, the contact
with righteousness of thought and
action which is the mainspring of
right thought and right deed in the
future.
Moreover, if clear thinking with
clean living is good lor the elect
few it is equally good for the
mutable many. Culture not only
raises a man above the mass, it
turns the masses into men. That
the multitude may imagine them
selves men before they hold a man's
grasj) on life is the grievous danger
of democracy. Here again the uni
versity plays its part, teaching the
relative value of ideals. Under its
criticism men learn that good re
sults are better than good inten
tions and that they demand a far
higher order of skill and courage.
1 heard a public man say the
other day that the university men
were not on his side of a certain
question. In fact, he said, the col
lege men arealwayson the contrary
side on every question. This is
nrobably true in the sense he

me#nt, for it is the province of col
lege men to judge intentions and
pretenses by ulliniate results.
When the tinal end is sure to he
had, according to the experience of
human wisdom, wise men must op
pose the beginning. The univer
sities have many times stood in op
position to the popular feeling of
the time, hut they have never found
their condemnation in the final
verdict of history. Only he who
has studied the affairs of men crit
ically, impartially, coldly, can dis
cover the real trend of forces in the
movements of today. This the
university has means to do. It
does not carry elections, in fact it
has seldom tried to do so, for the
results of an election play a very
.-mall part in the evolution of dem
ocracy ; not to carry elections but
rather to carry the people: that is
something worth doing. The words
of experience which are lost in
the noise of the hustings become
potent as the tumult passes by.
The people suffer many ills in
our social order, tor most of which
they only are responsible. , Be
cause men are not v\ise they know
not what to do. In ignorance and
weakness, they find themselves the
sport of fate, the flotsam of destiny,
ihe victims of evils that wisdom
and virtue instinctively avoid.
Next to knowing what to do is
the willingness 10 believe that son.e
one else possesses this knowledge.
6cepiicistu us to the existence 01
skill and intolerance toward the
possessor of knowledge are common
features of democracy. This is its
vulgar side, the disposition to do
mean things in a mean way, doubt
ing that there exist any better
things or any better ways of doing
them. Through this kind of vul
gaiity the average American is his
own physician, healing himself
with drugs (112 which he does not
know even the name. As a re
sult he suffers half his life
from self-inflicted poisoning. The
American is his own architect, and
for this reason oui cities are tilled
with buildings in which nightmares
might house, were it not for their
Iresh paint and .-mart ornamenta
tion. r l he American is his own
statesman, following his own im
pulses, guided by his own preju
dices. Thus he tills the land of the
free with oppression and injustice.
When he can no longer shut his
eyes to the misery be has wrought
befalls back on his good intentions
and lays the blame for his blunders
on destiny. The sense of personal
responsibility and personal ade
quacy which democracy gives is of
vital importance in the develop
ment of man. But it has its bad
side as well as its good. It is the
function of the university to strug
gle against the bad, day and night,
in season and out of season, to con
vert it into the other. That vul
garity is free to express itself in our
system does not exalt vulgarity. In
the long run in freedom vulgarity
linds its surest cure.
The people at large do not
understand nor value knowl
edge and power. Only those who
know well and see clearly can do
well. Knowledge does not flatter
nor coddle and men take to that
which plea-es ihem. The fact that
the majority do not believe in
know bilge is the reason why ihe
university must always lie in op
position to prevailing sentiment
and current action. '• When were 1 lie
yood a i id t rue ever in the majority V"
I here are not many of those who
speak and write on public affairs
who really care for what is true
or for what is just. The interest, of
most men lies in the success oi the

"cause." But the "cause," what
ever it may be, is only an incident
in intellectual awakening, a mere
episode in social development. It is
in the actual truth that the public
weal is bound up. Mo honest or
worthy cause appeals to the self
pity oi those it addresses. All calls
to the weakness or vanity or preju
dice or passion of men are dishon
est. All dishonesty results in evil.
Virtue that can last rests on grow
ing honesty and growing wisdom.
Because the university stands lor
the frte search tor truth, its influ
ence must be opposed to that oi
passion and prejudice. It must be
above the heats of the hour and
therefore in some degree opposed to
them. Thus those who survive on
the sands of the arena find the uni
versity distant and cold. This
again is its danger, that it should
be distant and cold. .Never to "vex
at the land's ridiculous miserie"
was an old ideal of the university.
It is an ideal long cherished in the
great universities ot England. But
it was never a worthy ideal, lo
exist for the needs of the people is
a mission worthy of Oxford or Har
vard or Berlin. It is the tinal high
est funtion of ail theglorious broth
erhood of plain lite and high
thought. '1 o keep up wisdom
among men is the natural function
oi the university. 1 he need of tin
limes is not of men to die for the
right, but ot men to live tor it; noi
ot men to oppose popular feeling
nor even to arouse the public con
science. Better than this is to train
the public thought. What we want
is not a revival of zeal, even for the
cause of righteousness. It is rather
a revival of wisdom. 'Ibis is fol
lowed by no chill nor backsliding,
while zeal, however well meaning,
is subject to ebbs and flows.
I heard a very rich man say not
long ago that he had no faith in
higher education. "Mine college
men out of every ten," he said,
"build up a wall between them
selves and life." By lite, be seemed
to mean the business of making
money. If this be life, the state
ment may be true, but even judged
by this standard, we must believe
that it was an inferior kind of col
lege men who thrust themselves
upon his notice. Some people look
upon men as useful only when they
can use them. The rest are merely
competing organisms, poor beggars
who ought to be got under ground
as soon as possible, to save the costs
of their keep. But it is not trui
that most college men build up a
wall between themselves and life.
It this is true in any individual
case, it is because the man was
not worth educating or because I lit
education was itself spurious. For
higher education can not make a
man where manhood did not exist
before. It can only take a man
already created and raise him to
higher effectiveness. Moreover,
there are frauds and imitations in
education as well as anywhere else
and misfit articles are thrown on
the market, cheap, every day. It
is said that ''our schools which
teach young people how to talk do
not teach tlieni how to live." It
this is true, it means that some
schools are shams, not giving real
education. But it is not by mis
takes and misfits that higher edu
cation is to be judged. It is by its
finished and adapted product. In
every walk in iite the higher educa
tion works to the benefit "i human
ity. The man who knows one
thing well can do it well. His presence
|ence in life is a help to his neigh
bor. He does not enter into com
petition but into elevation, lie
makes the business of living respect

able. in a Witfit magazine, Dr.
William He Witt Hyde gives a
stiiking account of the value of the
life work of a single scholar, the
honored President of Harvard:
"No one can begin to measure the
gain to civilization and human
happiness his services have wrought.
His leadership lias doubled the
rate of educational advance not in
Harvard alone but throughout the
United States. He has sought to
! extend the helping hand of sjni
paihy and appreciation to every
! struggling capacity in the humblest
grammar grade; to stimulate it into
j joyous blossoming under the sun
shine of congenial studies through
out the secondary years; to bring it
ito a sturdy and sound maturity in
the atmosphere of liberty in college
life; and finally, by stern selection
and thorough specialization, to
gather a harvest of experts in all
the higher walks of lile, on whose
skill, knowledge, integrity,and self
sacrilice their less trained fellows
can implicitly rely for higher in
struction, professional counsel, and
| public leadership. In consequence
lof these comprehensive reiorms,
Iwe see the lirst beginnings of a
j lational and universal church,
not separate lrom existing sects,
| but permeating all; property
j lights m all their subtle tonus are
i more secuie and well defined; hun
| dreds of persons are alive today
j who under physicians of interior
training would have died long ago;
thousands of college students have
had quickened within them a keen
intellectual interest, and earnest
spiritual purpose, a 'personal power
in action under responsibility,' who
under the old regime would have
remained listless and indifferent;
tens of thousands of boys and gills
lin secondary schools can expand
their hearts and minds with science
and history and the languages of
other lands, who but for President
Eliot would have been doomed to
the monotonous treadmill of loimal
studies for which they have no
aptitude or taste; and, as years go
l>y, hundreds of thousands of ttie
children of the poor, in the precious
tender years before their dralting
into lives of drudgery and toil, in
place of the dry husks ot superflu
ous arithmetic, the thrice-thrashed
straw of unessential grammar, and
the innutritions shells of unremem
berable geographical details, will
get some briel glimpse of the won
drous loveliness of nature and her
laws, some sliuht touch of inspira
tion from the words and deeds of
ihe world's wisest and bravest men,
io carry with them as a heritage to
brighten their luture humble homes
and gladden all their after lives.
"In such 'good measure, pressed
down, shaken together, running
over/ has there been given to this
great educational reformer, in re
turn for thirty years of generous and
steadfast service of his university,
his fellow men, his country, and
his (iod, what, in true Puritan sim
plicity, he calls, 'that finest luxury,
to do some perpetual good in this
world.'"
Not long since one of our writers
expressed regret at the numbers of
young men sent forth each year to
swell the educated proletariat of
America. His assumption is that
each is to scramble for his living,
struggling with his competitors,
dissatisfied because his ambitions
iar outrun every possible achieve
ment. The very reverse of this is
the fact in America, whatever may
be the case elsewhere, as amidst
'' ihe bidridden officialism of
France.'' The man of char
acter who is educated aright
finds very soon his levei in our
community. Before he came he
was not wauled, but once in his
place, everybody seems looking for
him. The college men of America
need no help and no pity from any
source. They can take care oi
themselves and iliey can take care
of others. To them as to Emerson,
"America means opportunity," and
there are more opportunities today
than ever before to the man who is
able to grasp them. But to grasp
the greater opportunities, the first
essential is not to despise the small
ones. An education that turns a
man away from honest work how
ever humble, that lies in the line of
duty, is not sound education. That
some education is unsound and
some men are unmanly in no wise
shows that real training does not
strengthen real men.
Each year makes higher de
mands, it is true. There are fewer
tilings worlh having to be had for
the simple asking. This is because
the nation is growing more critical.
It is beginning to demand fitness,
not alone mere willingness. The
opportunities it has to offer are fall
ing into the hands of trained men,
and these men demand still higher
training from those who are to be
their successors.
A skilled engineerwill not choost
as his assistant and successor a
man who knows wheels and engines
oniy by rule ol thumb. An edu
cated chemist will not make way
fora druggist's clerk nor a gradu
ate of West Point to a political
favorite whose military training
was gained as elevator boy or ae>
driver of a beer wagon. Training
counts alike 111 all walks of life, in
a democracy not less than in an
empire. As the people come to un
derstand the reality of knowledge
so will they learn to appreciate its
worth.
Another very rich man doubts
the value of college education; at
the same time he places the highest
estimate on applied chemistry, be
through the skill of the
chemist employed in his steel man
ufactory he laid the foundations oi
his own wealth. But applied
chemistry is a part of h-gher knowl
edge. It rests on the broader chem
istry not yet applied. To train
chemists is likewise a part of the
higher education. Higher educa
tion consists no longer as many
seem to suppose, in writing Latin
verses and reading mythology in
Greek. These things have their
place and a great place in the his
tory of culture, but it is to ' Greek -
minded men and Roman-minded
men" that they belong. They form
no longer the sole avenue by which
the goal of the scholar can be
reached.
The keynote of the modern uni
versity is its usefulness. Its help
is no longer limited to one kind of
man or one kind of ability, cramp
ing or excluding all others. "It
welcomes every ray of varied gen
ius to its hospitable halls." It is
its highest pride that no man who
brings to its class-rooms brains
and courage is ever turned away
unhelped.
Because of this broadening of
university ideals, there are six col
lege students in California today
where there was one ten years ago.
For this reason, the same ten years
has witnessed a marvelous expan
sion in all universities where gen
erous ideals have found lodgment.
Where the old notion that all
culture runs in a single groove,
still obtains; where it is attempted
to train all men by one process,
whatever this process be, th»'re is
no growth in numbers, no extension
of influence, no sign of greater

abundance of life. Just in propor
tion as constructive individualism
111 education has been made a guid
ing principle, so have our universi
ties grown in numbers and influence,
in this proportion and for this
reason have they deserved to grow.
For this reason James Biyce de
clares, that of all results of democ
racy, the American university
offers the largest promise for the
future.
The scholar, in the true sense, is
the man or woman for whom the
schools have done their best. The
scholar knows some one thing
thoroughly and can carry out his
knowledge into action. With this,
he must have such an acquaintance
with related subjects and with
human life as will throw this special
knowledge into proper perspective.
Anything less than this is not schol
arship. The man with knowledge
and no perspective is a crank, a
disturber of the peace, who needs a
guardian to make his knowledge
useful. The man who has com
mon sense but no special training
may be a fair citizen but he can
exert little influence that makes for
progress. There may be a wisdom
not of books, but it can be won by
no easy process. To gain wisdom
or skill in school or out is educa
tion. To do anything well requires
special knowledge and this is schol
arship whether attained in the
university or in the school of life,
it is the man who knows that has
the right to speak.
That the monarchy needs the uni
versity has been recognized ever
since culture began. The univer
sities of Europe were founded by
the great kings; the wiser the king
the more deeply he felt the need of
scholars as his helpers. So Alfred
founded Oxford and Charlemagne
the University of Paris, while the
founder of the University of Berlin
well deserves the name of "Great,"
even though it were lor nothing
else. In the darkest days of Hol
land, William the Silent erected
the University of Leyden. He
needed it in his struggle against
Spain. He needed it in the war
fare for independence. A univer
sity breeds free men whom physi
cal force can not bind.
But the need of the monarchy
for men of high culture and exact
training is less than that of dem
ocracy. Under a monarchy such
men must hold office. In a dem
ocracy they must hold the people.
They must form fixed points in the
civic mass, units of intelligence,
not to be bribed nor stampeded. The
presence of the king is not the es
sential feature of a monarchy: it
is the absence of the people Where
the people are not consulted, it is
not vital to the government that
they be wise, nor even that wise
men be among them. In fact they
are more easily handled without
this kind of obstruction. There
fore the tendency of the monarchy
is to separate the men from the
mass, as we may choose the sheep
from among the goats. But in a
democracy those who are ruled
must also rule. They have 110 less
need of individual wisdom but they
must have it diffused among theni
selves, not concentrated in a class
above them. Nothing can be done
fora democracy save what the
people do for themselves. It is
impossible to provide for it an ed
ucated oligarchy. Its public ser
vants are of its own kind, its
agents or its attorneys, in no sense
its rulers, not often even its lead
ers. For the most part therefore,
the wisest men in a democracy will
not be in office. The voice of wis
dom must rise from the body of the

people to the seat of power. When
a democracy needs a leader in the
throne of authority it is because it
has gone out of its way in some
fashion or other. Going out of its
way it has come to a crisis. The
cause of every crisis in a democ
racy is a mistake of one sort or
another. A crisis arises with a
question of right and wrong. [Such
a question never becomes a burn
ing one unless the popular feeling
has somewhere gone wrong and
worked itself out in wrong action.
When this is the case it is the
scholar's business to know it. He
is the sensitive barometer who feels
first the lowered pressure of re
jected duty, the first warning of
the coming storm. The warning
he gives, his neighbors will not
receive with favor. He will not
receive a "donation party" nor a
vote of thanks, nor a new pair of
boots for giving it expression, but
it is his business to speak and he
can not remain a scholar if he
takes refuge in silence. Dr. Nor
man Bridge has well expressed a
similar thought in these words:
" The mere fact that one or two
men in a hundred are known to be
uninfluenced by the clamors of any
rabble, good or had, is to any com
munity a force of unspeakable
value. The excitable ones know
well that the fiftieth man must be
met and conciliated or overcome in
any hot-headed movement. He is
a factor as a voter and a citizen
that can not be ignored, and he ex
ercises a wholesome, regulating,
and modifying, often repressive in
fluence on the hasty tendencies of
the crowd. The thieves of the
public treasury, of all classes and
shades, are afraid of him. Even
one forceful man in a hundred
thousand may have an amazing
influence on public affairs if he has
the time and the inclination to de
vote to disinterested care of the
public interests. There are a few
such men in each of our large cit
ies. In one of the large centers of
the East, a wealthy man of leisure
was for many years a terror to the
hot-headed and the filchers of the
public, and solely because he gave
himself to the task, and they kney
that they would have to meet him at
every turn. Thisone man in the mul
titude may be called a croaker or a
fossil, but often he is the sole force
that is able to check the rising of
the mob or the stampede of the
army, or to compel men to stop
and think before taking action that
may be hasty or regrettable."
The scholar will not go far out
of his way in matters of this kind.
Because his knowledge is intense it
must correspondingly be narrow.
The tendencies to good and evil in
our social condition are so varied
and intertangled, that those who
trace out the relations of one set of
combinations must perforce neglect
the others. The scholar who raises
his voice against unjust or unwise
taxation may be silent on the
question of misapplied charity.
The scholar who becomes an au
thority on the pnrity of water can
not be an equal judge of the pur
ity of elections. The expert on
electricity is not necessarily the
best judge of ghost stories. He
may be so hut we can not expect
it. Each must do his own part in
his own way in his own section ot
the field of knowledge. Each must
say his own word as his own truth
comes to him, though he know that
his own times let it pass unheeded,
and though In* know th.it his voice
be overborne by the louder tones of
mere pretenders to knowledge.
For it is one of the conditions of
democracy that wisdom and its

counterfeit go along together side
by side. There can be no tag or
label to mark one from the other
and the people would not heed
them if there were. We can only
know wisdom from imposture by
its results, or by the test of our
own wisdom. The government can
not brand a Keeley lest the public
mistake him fora Faraday. A
Tesla and a Helmholtz pass as
great alike and for the public he is
greatest whose name is oftenest in
the daily newspapers. All this is
well. It is better for men to choose
the voice of wisdom for themselves
rather than to have it infallibly
pointed out to them by the govern
ing authority. For the seat of wis
dom is the individual soul, and it
grows through individual effort.
The scholar is silent for the most
part in the rush and hurry of the
world. When he has no reason for
speaking he reserves his strength
for his own due season and his own
line of action. But he must be free
to speak when needs arise. Hecan
not breathe in confined air, and
his speech or his silence must be at
his own will, subject to his own
conscience and the demands of
truth.
In our days men talk too much,
in the papers, in the magazines, in
the open atmosphere. They fill the
literary air with vain shoutings.
But there can never be too much
earnest talk, if based on real knowl
edge. The old elementary truths
of justice and humanity need to be
recalled to us day after day, while,
on the other hand, better tools are
giving us every day better com
mand over the forces of nature.
The voice of the oldest and the
newest must together somehow
reach our ears, if our actions are to
be righteous or our enterprises suc
cessful.
To the scholar we must look for
this. Only he who knows for him
self some truth which rests on the
foundations of the universe has a
right to the name of scholar. And
the scholar will speak when the due
time conies for speaking. Whatever
our creeds and conventions he will
break through them with the truth.
He can never afford to do less if
the truth he utters be really his
own, and the product of his own
contact with the "power that each
day creates and recreates man.''
No authority can bend him to si
lence; no title can bribe him; no
force can close his mouth. He must,
if need be, have the spirit of the
martyr. He must consider, not
the consequences to himself, to his
business, to society—only the de
mands of truth.
That the scholar must speak,
again emphasizes his need of com
mon sense. Common sense is that
instinct which throws all knowledge
into right perspective. It rests on
sound habits of orientation. He
who knows where the sun rises
never fails to make out all the other
points of the compass. This power
the schools alone can not give.
They can strengthen it, but they
can not create it, and they must
not lake it away. It is the founda
tion of all true culture, for science
is only enlightened common sense.
As a part of common sense the
scholar must distinguish his truth
trom bis opinions. He must not
mistake for the eternal verity his
own prejudice, bis own ambition,
or his own desires. For he is hu
man on all his human sides, and
is subject to temptations that mas
ter other men. lie is in better form
to resist, no doubt, but that does
not insure immunity. Moreover,
his truth may be only half truth
at the best, and the other half
truths may seem to contradict it.
To know a half truth from a whole
one is the part of common sense,
but common sense is a possession
still more rare than learning. \Vhen
scholars forget, their voices ri.-e
in discord, and this discord casts
discredit over knowledge. When
half truths are set off one against an
other, we may Kni displayed all the
vulgarity of into'erance in quarters
where intolerance should be un
known. All this should teach the
scholar modesty. It should warn
him of the need of charity, but it
should not silence his voice.
He must speak, he will speak,
and it is the safety of democracy
that sooner or later his word is tri
umphant. The final outcome of
all action rests with the educated
man. Not all the politicians of all
the parties in all the republics
have scored so many final victories
in thought and action as the uni
versities.
I read lately an attempt to show
that the scholar or the clergyman
should never write or speak on any
public question lest he expose him
self to criticism or find his person
ality tumbled about in the dust of
the political arena. The clergy
man devotes his life to the study of
moral questions in the light of re
ligion. The scholar devotes him
self to the study of truth wherever

found iiixl of the ways by which
tru h may be nuide a vai la I> I e t"
men. If the scholar and tip
clergyman are to In* s lent <h
questions of vital inteiest I" men,
who indeed is to speak? Is it
the politician of the day, a nit ie
echo without an idea of his own?
Is it the man of money who may
have an axe to grind in every
movement in public affair , «> (
who again may seek undisturbed
possession of that which justice
would place in other hands ? Is
it the popular agitator to whom
the social order is one long tit of
hysteria? Must we confine all
public utterance t"> those whose
passions are excited or whose in
terests are touched ? Shall Em
erson and Lowell, Theodore Par
ker and Phillips Brooks be silent
while the fighting editor is heard?

The scholar should l»e above all
influence of passion or profit. He
should speak for tin* clear, hard,
unyielding, unflattering, unpitying
truth. If he enters the arena he
must as a man take his chances
with the rest. His thoughts must,
he his only weapon. Passion,
rhetoric, satire, these are arms for
weaker men to use, not for the
scholar. His only sword is the truth.
His personal credentials may he
challenged. He will meet the scorn
of men who do not know truth
when they see it, and to whom his
thought seems hut a puny weapon.
More than this, he will meet as ad
versaries scholars, real or pre
tended, men who see tlie truth from
a single side, or who have never
seen it at all, yet feign to he its de
fenders.
As to all this the scholar must he
patient. If he is right the ages
will find him out. If he is wrong
the fault is with his own weakness,
not with truth. He must he loyal
to the I test lie knows, caring no
more for majorities than the stars
do, unshaken hy feeling, hy tradi
tion, or hy fear. The voice of a clani
orous nioh on the one hand is 110
more to him than the dictum of a
king or a priest or all antiquity.
Nor is it le>s, for one or all of these
are matters not to he taken in evi
dence when the scholar makes his
final decision. Therahhleof today
which the scholar has to face is not
the rabble of yesterday. The axe

and the fagot, the club and the pav
ing stone, have gone out of date as
means of argument. The weapon
of the mot> of today is mud. When
a scholar stands for God's t ruth the
answer of today is personal abuse,
'lo a man the rahlile can not under
stand are ascribed all the vulgar
motives of the rabble. His words
and his teachings are distorted and
vulgarized until the multitude rec
ognize them as brought down to
their own level.
Even the invention of the print
ing press has not been an unmixed
blessing. The newspaper brings a
degree of enlightenment into every
home. But it brings error as well
as truth, and if a man allows a
newspaper to do his thinking for
him he is not much the wiser for
the newspaper's help. Charles F.
Lnminis tells us that : Freedom for
the press or for any one else is lib
erty to do right. It is not full
swing to be ignorant, mendacious,
or bullying. The newspaper which
mistranlates and abuses its strength
is not only a foe to its own fellow
ship ; it is a public enemy. It cheap
ens the public mind and waters
the public morals. It builds the
notion that conscience, earnestness,
self- respect, bra ins, and scholars hi p
are of less value than the ability to
yet on a paper. Even an illiterate,
unscrupulous reporter can club a

sage or a prophet from the field. It I
has been said that gunpowder killed
chivalry. Before that villainous j
saltpetre it was man to man. The!
better man won. Hut a coward
could pull the trigger just as well
as Richard the Lion Heart. I'ar-:
tieularly as he didn't need to look j
into the hero's eyes when he pulled.)
For like reasons a time may come
when a later epigrammatist shall
write that the invention of the print- I
ing press was the death-knell of
scholarship."
In this gloomy outlook the
scholar has two facts of consolation.
Truth is a statue to which mud can
never stick. The man without j
brains is the man without influ-j
ence A little patience and the
human storm shall pass by. The j
atmosphere will clear, and again
with Emerson, the scholar shall be
hold above him " the gods sitting
alone on their thrones, they alone
and he alone."
The university is an association
of scholars. It stands for the free
judgment and the free proclama
tion of truth. Without these it can
stand for nothing else. Our place
today is within the free walls of a
free University. If the professors
in these halls were conscience
boiind this could not be a univer- I
sity. It they w< re silent through
pressine or policy lien the llniver j
silv would call lor men who knew]
not pressure or policy. Academic
freedom is the University's high-1

ent privilege. It is its noblest
duty.
Were the truth not held sacred,
we should not be here —not you our
students, nor your teachers, nor
our trustees, nor our founders, who
have meant to place the University
of their hearts above all influences
and control of parties, sects, or
I creeds. Stanford would not be it
self were it something else. If it
were something else, it would not
be the University our founders gave
us, the university we revere, and
we should not rejoice to stand
within its beautiful sunlit walls to
day We are here because this is
our hoi.ie, the home of the scholar.
Our University is of the people,
built for the training of the people,
for the ennobling of men, the per
petuation of democracy. The
''winds of freedom are blowing"
through its corridors and along its
fair arcades, and there is no one
among us or with us or above us
who would have it otherwise.
"Above all sects is truth." Above
all parties and conventions, above
all pride and prejudice and passion
arise the teachings of nature, the
lessons of human experence. To
hear these teachings, to learn these
lessons is the function of the uni
versity. To proclaim them wisely
is the function of the scholar, and
it is our mission to help permeate

the republic with our scholarship.
We would place as fixed beacons in
the swaying tides of democracy
those men and women who can
never be moved by feeble currents,
who know what to do. who have the
will to do it and the courage to
abide the consequences.
That we believe you to be such
men and women is the meaning of
the tokens we have placed in your
hands today.
