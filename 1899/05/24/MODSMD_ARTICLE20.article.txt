Apparently, the kind of questions
for the sociologist to study are:
What, if any, are the established
orders of development of society
and human institutions? What
conditions always precede and
what conditions accompany the de
velopment <»112 what we regard as
the higher civilization, and what
conditions always accompany the
decadence of social institutions?
These questions will not he an
swered by looking for analogies be
tween the growth of nations and
the growth of trees or animals.
They must be answered, if an
swered at all, by the careful collec
tion and verification of facts, and
by making generalizations based
upon facts after the facts are known,
it must be remembered, too, that a
law of nature is not, like a law of
grammar, subject to exceptions.
"A law of nature," says Helmholtz,
"is not a mere logical conception
that we have adopted as a kind of
memoria technic,a to enable us
more readily remember facts.
We of the present day have already
sufficient insrght to know that the
laws of nature are not things which
we can evolve by any speculative
method. On the contrary, we have
to discover them in facts; we have
to test them by repeated observa
tion or experiment, in constantly
new cases, under ever varying cir
cumstances; and in proportion only
is they hold good under constantly
increasing change of conditions, in
i constantly increasing number of
cases, and with greater delicacy in
ihe means of observation, does our
confidence in their trustworthiness
rise.
"Thus the laws of nature occupy
ihe position of a power with which
we are not familiar, not to be arbi
trarily selected and determined in
our minds, as one might devise var
ious systems of animals and plants,
one after another, so long as the
object is only one of classification.
Before we can say that our knowl
edge of any one law of nature is
complete, we must see that it holds
good without exception, and make
ibis the test of its correctness. If
we can be assured that the condi
tions under which the law operates
have themselves, the re
sult must ensue, without arbitrari
ness, without choice, without our
co-operation, and from the very ne
cessity which regulates the things
of the external world as well as our
perception."
It is upon such laws as these that
any true science must be based, and
it is only to subjects of investiga
tion in which some such laws have
been established that the name sci
ence can be properly applied. Ap
parently, we have discovered a
method of finally arriving at a
knowledge of such laws in the
physical universe. That this
method in its entirety can not be
applied to the mental and moral
sciences, 1 have tried to show. That
it can not be used at all in the
study of language or literature or
mathematics would seem self-evi
dent. The discovery and adoption
of the scientific method represents
the greatest intellectual acquire
ment of the last three centuri« s, and
it is only in those departments of
human knowledge to which the sci
entific method can be wholly or in
part applied that the intellectual
achievements of our century sur
pass those of former centuries. It
yet remains for investigators in
other subjects to find a method of
research which will lead to ihesame
relatively sure results in their fields
of investigation.
