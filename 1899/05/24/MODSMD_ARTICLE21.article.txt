# The 						Latin Play.
## 
### 
Few occurrences at Stanford have
attracted wider notice than the pub
lic performance 011 May 9 in the
original Latin of scenes iroui the
"Trinummus" (Three Coins) of
Plautus.
This play, which was read, in_a
class of Professor Fairclough's last
semester, is conceded to be one of
the most amusing comedies that
have come down from antiquity.
Some of the scenes, indeed, could
hardly be surpassed for their humor
and fun. At the same time, cer
tain features of the plot, such as
the honest fidelity, amid tempta
tions and difficulties of one friend
to another, the affectionate devotion
of a slave to his master, and the
story of honorable love fora dow
erless maiden, combine to secure an
elevated range of moral sentiment
which is unusual in plays based as
are those of Plautus 011 the new
Attic comedy.
The "Trinummus " is the origi
nal of Lessiug's "Scliatz," and
turns upon the idea of a hidden
treasure. An Athenian, named
Charmides, being threatened with
ruin by his dissolute sou Lesbonicus,
buries a sum ol money under his
house, and alter entrusting his son
and daughter with all his business
interests to his friend Callicles, sets
out 011 a long voyage to rebuild his
shattered fortunes. Alter ins de
parture Lesbonicus adopts various
means of raising money, and 011 one
occasion when Callicles was absent
lor a few days in the country he of
fers his father's house for sale by
auction. The faithful Callicles re
turns just in time to buy it in, and
then lor safety's sake is compelled
to make it his own home, thus giv
ing color to the belief that he is
faithless to Charmides.
Now it happens that a young
man named Lysiteles falls in love
with Lesbonicus' sister, whose hand
he asks in marriage. But Lesbon
icus, notwithstanding his own
reckless life, is jealous of his sister's
honor, is unable to provide a dowry,
and as marriage without a dowry

was highly discreditable, he refuses
his consent.
Callicles, however, is naturally
anxious to see the daughter of his
friend well settled in life, and as
this was a most advantageous
match he contrives a scheme for
meeting the objections of Lesboni
cus. A sycophant or professional
knave is hired in the Piraeus, or
harbor of Athens, for three pieces
of gold. This man, whose "every
day name" is I'rax, is to pretend
that he has just returned from the
distant east, carrying letters from
Charmides for Callicles and Lesbon

icus, with a purse of gold for his
daughter's dowry. The money
was really to come from Charmides'
buried treasure.
Meanwhile Charmides himself
returns from abroad. He has just
offered up thanks to Neptune for
preserving him from the perils of
the sea and is about to enter his
house when he encounters the ex
traordinary figure of the sycophant.
This scene is extremely amusing.
The sycophant, determined to play
his part well, invents marvelous
stories of his travels, but spoils
his case by forgetting the name
of the man who is supposed to
have sent him to Athens. Char
mides, on the other hand, hav
ing found out the other's bus
iness, tries vainly to secure the
purse of gold iroui the syco
phant, who now withdraws in
disgust after heaping curses 011
Charmides for returning so in
opportunely.
Charmides next meets his
slave Stasimus, who tells him
that Callicles, having turned
out his son and daughter, has
taken possession oi the old
home himself. As he is be
wailing the treachery of his
friend and loss of his property,
Callicles, who has been busy
u iggi n g U P the treasure with
in, makes his appearance. Ex
planations follow, the house is
restored to Charmides, a dowry
is readily provided, Lysiteles
wins his bride, and L,esboui
cus, forgiven by his father, agrees
to settle down in life.
The cast was as follows:

The "Trinummus" is really a
Greek play, written in L,atiu, and
therefore the costumes and other ac
cessories employed were Greek. An
exception to this rule was the Syc
ophant's garb, which in view of the
character was Oriental, its distill-

guishing feature being the enor
mous head-gear. The ensemble ef
fect of beautiful colors, graceful
drapery, and appropriate scenery,
with marble altar, gold trident, and
flaming incense was remarkably
pleasing. The Latin was very
clearly enuciated and the acting
was unusually good, especially when
we consider that none of the stu
dents had ever before appeared on
the stage. The lyrical parts of
the play were accompanied by
suitable music, a good illustra
tion being Charmides' thanksgiving
to Neptune, which includes the de

scription of a storm ac sea. The
clarinet, the nearest representative
of the ancient flute, was the only
instrument employed. The inter
ludes were necessarily modern, but
the prelude was a fragment of an
cient Greek music, charmingly sung
behind the scenes by Mrs. E. M.
Pease.
Before the perfoiwance Mr. Jef
ferson Elmore gave a lucid account
of Latin comedy and the plot of the
play.
The main credit lor this signal

success belongs to Professor Fair
clough, who conceived the plan,
trained the students, and superin
tended every detail of the perfor
mance. Stanford can congratulate
herself 011 being the first institution
west of the Mississippi to produce a
classical comedy. Can we hope to
rival Harvard with an "CEdipus
Tyrannus" is the next question to
be considered.

are those of Plautus 011 the new
Attic comedy.
The "Trinummus " is the origi
nal of Lessiug's "Scliatz," and
turns upon the idea of a hidden
treasure. An Athenian, named
Charmides, being threatened with
ruin by his dissolute sou Lesbonicus,
buries a sum ol money under his
house, and alter entrusting his son
and daughter with all his business
interests to his friend Callicles, sets
out 011 a long voyage to rebuild his
shattered fortunes. Alter ins de
parture Lesbonicus adopts various
means of raising money, and 011 one
occasion when Callicles was absent
lor a few days in the country he of
fers his father's house for sale by
auction. The faithful Callicles re
turns just in time to buy it in, and
then lor safety's sake is compelled
to make it his own home, thus giv
ing color to the belief that he is
faithless to Charmides.
Now it happens that a young
man named Lysiteles falls in love
with Lesbonicus' sister, whose hand
he asks in marriage. But Lesbon
icus, notwithstanding his own
reckless life, is jealous of his sister's
honor, is unable to provide a dowry,
and as marriage without a dowry

was highly discreditable, he refuses
his consent.
Callicles, however, is naturally
anxious to see the daughter of his
friend well settled in life, and as
this was a most advantageous
match he contrives a scheme for
meeting the objections of Lesboni
cus. A sycophant or professional
knave is hired in the Piraeus, or
harbor of Athens, for three pieces
of gold. This man, whose "every
day name" is I'rax, is to pretend
that he has just returned from the
distant east, carrying letters from
Charmides for Callicles and Lesbon

icus, with a purse of gold for his
daughter's dowry. The money
was really to come from Charmides'
buried treasure.
Meanwhile Charmides himself
returns from abroad. He has just
offered up thanks to Neptune for
preserving him from the perils of
the sea and is about to enter his
house when he encounters the ex
traordinary figure of the sycophant.
This scene is extremely amusing.
The sycophant, determined to play
his part well, invents marvelous
stories of his travels, but spoils
his case by forgetting the name
of the man who is supposed to
have sent him to Athens. Char
mides, on the other hand, hav
ing found out the other's bus
iness, tries vainly to secure the
purse of gold iroui the syco
phant, who now withdraws in
disgust after heaping curses 011
Charmides for returning so in
opportunely.
Charmides next meets his
slave Stasimus, who tells him
that Callicles, having turned
out his son and daughter, has
taken possession oi the old
home himself. As he is be
wailing the treachery of his
friend and loss of his property,
Callicles, who has been busy
u iggi n g U P the treasure with
in, makes his appearance. Ex
planations follow, the house is
restored to Charmides, a dowry
is readily provided, Lysiteles
wins his bride, and L,esboui
cus, forgiven by his father, agrees
to settle down in life.
The cast was as follows:
Charmides. .Prof. H. R. Fairclough
Callicles J. L,e Roy Dixon, '99
Sycophant 1). B. Spooner, '99
Stasimus J. Jarnick, '00
Flute-player A. Muller, '02
The "Trinummus" is really a
Greek play, written in L,atiu, and
therefore the costumes and other ac
cessories employed were Greek. An
exception to this rule was the Syc
ophant's garb, which in view of the
character was Oriental, its distill-

guishing feature being the enor
mous head-gear. The ensemble ef
fect of beautiful colors, graceful
drapery, and appropriate scenery,
with marble altar, gold trident, and
flaming incense was remarkably
pleasing. The Latin was very
clearly enuciated and the acting
was unusually good, especially when
we consider that none of the stu
dents had ever before appeared on
the stage. The lyrical parts of
the play were accompanied by
suitable music, a good illustra
tion being Charmides' thanksgiving
to Neptune, which includes the de

scription of a storm ac sea. The
clarinet, the nearest representative
of the ancient flute, was the only
instrument employed. The inter
ludes were necessarily modern, but
the prelude was a fragment of an
cient Greek music, charmingly sung
behind the scenes by Mrs. E. M.
Pease.
Before the perfoiwance Mr. Jef
ferson Elmore gave a lucid account
of Latin comedy and the plot of the
play.
The main credit lor this signal

success belongs to Professor Fair
clough, who conceived the plan,
trained the students, and superin
tended every detail of the perfor
mance. Stanford can congratulate
herself 011 being the first institution
west of the Mississippi to produce a
classical comedy. Can we hope to
rival Harvard with an "CEdipus
Tyrannus" is the next question to
be considered.
