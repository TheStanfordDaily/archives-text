# The 						Senior Extravaganza.
## 
### 
For the first time in tlie history
of Stanford dramatics, a show in
the nature of a light opera has

been attempted and carried
through successfully. Will H.
Irwin is the author of the
clever extravaganza, "Atalan
ta in Stanford," modelled on
the lines of the burlesques and
travesties so much in vogue
with the Mask and Wig Club
of I\nnsylvania, and similar
organizations in Yaleand Har
vard. It was an especially
creditable show, in that all
the work, libretto and music,
was done by undergraduates
here. To Mr. Irwin the largest
share of praise should go. not
only on account of the author
ship, but also because of the
clever stage management.
Larry Bowman and R. K.
Culver come in fora portion
of the credit, since some of the
cleverest lines were from their
pens. Hardly in a less degree
than to the author does the
praise for much of the-success
of the performance belong to

Miss May Hurllnirt, who composed
or adapted all of the music used in
the production, and who also ti 1 led
the arduous position of accompan
ist.
The athletic co-ed gives the cue
to the plot of the play. The story
is, that Miss Atalanta Leigh, the
lioble champion all-round athlete,
holder of several college records, is
loved by Jack Blair, who is not her
equal in physical prowess. In the
first act, Jack proposes time after
time, until his declarations of love
become merely mechanical through
habit. Finally Atalanta, sure in

her position, promises to consider
Blair's proposal if lie can beat her
in a race. At this point a gypsy
enters, who after telling fortunes
hy the palms, sells a love charm to
Blair, which administered to \t
alanta, will turn her love to him.
Jack gives the potion, and Ata
lanta falling asleep, dreams.
The next two acts give Atalanta's
dream. It seems that Jupiter Plu
vius, with all the Olympian cote
rie, Juno, Mars, Mercury, Venus,
and the rest, is sent to Stanford to

take charge of the "brain factory"
during Dr. Jordan's absence in
Alaska. He succeeds in keeping
things going after a fashion, but in
spite of the revels he institutes,
can not get along very well. His
particular evil genius, it seems, is
one Adderclaws who terrorizes
everybody. Things get very much
mixed when Venus falls in love
with Blair, who still loves Ata
lanta. In the course of some of
the revels the race between Jack
and Miss Leigh is to take place.
But in the meantime Venus and
Juno concoct another stipulation
for the race, that the loser shall die
by Jove's thunderbolts. Mean
i while Blair and Mercury patch up
j another plan, by which Blair runs
I only the final lap, Mercury as
| Blair running the others. To frus
trate Venus' revenge, they substi
tute false, ineffectual thunderbolts
for the real article. But Venus
and Juno overhear the plan for the
j change of lightning and decide to
frustrate it. In the race Blair
wins, and Jupiter uses his ammu
nition in vain. Juno stakes the
genuine lightning to kill Atalanta,
who screams, " Save me, Jack !
Jack, save me I'' and wakes up.
The final act shows the awaken
ing of Miss Leigh from her sleep
and ir.to the knowledge of her love
for Blair. As she loses her drowsi
ness she sees the freshman love
making of a Miss Hattie Blake and
Mr. Clarence Fairchild. This de
cides her fully in favor of Blair,
I who makes her do the proposing
and deigns to accept her.
