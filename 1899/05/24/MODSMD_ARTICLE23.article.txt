# The 						Promenade Conceit.
## 
### 
The evening of Tuesday was
perfect for the purposes of the
Promenade Concert, except fora
plight shower just at the end of the
evening's program. The quad was
decorated with Chinese lanterns
hung around the edge of the roof
and the seven booths were bril
liantly illuminated by lanterns and
lamps.
In the center of the quad a cir
cular bandstand had been erected.
Bennett's concert band furnished
the music.
