The following facts were learned
from Dr. .Jordan'* toast at the
Alumni banquet :
The Assembly Hall has been ac
cepted and used and seems to he in
every way satisfactory as a hall for
general assembly purposes.
The Library building, the gift of
Mr. Thomas Welton Stanford,
is well under way. In speaking of
the Library Dr. Jordan said that
$1,700,000 was realized by the sale
of property. Of this amount
$700,000 is to be devoted to the
Library for the purchase of books.
That means that the Library will
hive hereji U«-r $ I IS 000 each year in
j 1 ice of the $oM)0 it is now eon -
fined to. Hereafter they can do as
much in one year as is possible in
six at the present. Fur her, about
one dollar out of every live tnat is

received ;it Encina Hall will be de
voted to the purchase of books.
This led President Jordan to speak
at some length upon the urgent
desirability of filling Encina Hall.
The rest of the money that has
been gained beside that used for the
Library will go in part to the build
ings and in part to a general rais
ing of professor's salaries.
In speaking of the Library build
ing Dr. Jordan said that Mrs. Stan
ford had decided to replace the tin
roof on the new Assembly Hall and
Library building by one of tiles to
correspond with the rest of the
quadrangle. There will be consid
erable difference in cost and it was
this consideration that induced her
to have the tin roof.
The Memorial Arch, which is
now being erected, will connect the
Assembly Hall and a building of
similar appearance which will be
devoted to (jioology, Zoology, etc.
Ihe contract for this building has
already been let.
To the east of the new Library
building an adjoining building will
be constructed for the use of the
departments of History, Economics,
and English. The internal plans
of this building will be left to a de
