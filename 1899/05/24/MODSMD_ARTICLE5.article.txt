The undergraduate days of '99
are a tiling of the past; her mem
bership is now with those who have
spent a few happy days of prepara
tion here and then left us and gone
out to live their lives with men in
the world, many of them already
winning respect and honor for
themselves, and in so doing confer
ring dignity and glory upon their
University. One more name has
been added to the slowly grow
ing list of graduate classes, the
worthy body of Stanford alumni.
'99 may look back with pleasure
and pride at her record while here.
She came in in one of the darkest
hours of the UDiversity's existence.
Her loyalty was tested and proved at
the very beginning of her life here

and her affection strengthened and
increased by the times of anxious
trial and suspense that marked her
first years in college a6 well as by
the times of rejoicing over victory
and the dissipation of those troubles
that have marked the earlier part
of her four years' stay. Of the
present period ot renewed vigor and
growth she has been permitted to
see only the beginning. To her as
to '95 the Quad will stand in mem
ory as a four-square court sur
rounded by a pillared arcade
crowned with low red roofs. The
mighty arch and chapel tower are
things that were begun in her day,
but whose completion did not come
until later. Even the first of these
new structures, the Assembly Hall,
in which she is the first class to
hold the commencement exercises,
will not be present in the minds of
most members of '99 when they re
call the Quad of their college days.
'99 is a part of the old regime, the
early days of struggle. But, hap
pily, it has been possible for her in
the last lew months to partake of
the enthusiasm of the triumph of
the Univerity over its difficulties.
She is a part, too, of the new order
of tilings.
