The new Assembly ilall was used
for I lie lirst time on last Sunday
morning, when Rev. Charles K
Brown of Oakland delivered the
baccalaureate sermon. The speaker
is exceptionally forceful and logi
cal and his address was most im
pressive. in particular it was re
markable for its freshness and vigor,
its earnestness and breadth. There
were in it none of the ear-marks
of the time-worn commencement
sermon, the admonitions as to the
future that are so trite as to he al
most meaningless. On the con
trary, Dr. Brown carried his hear
ers step by step through a beautiiul
allegory based on the twenty-Hist
chapter of Revelations, the text
being the particular line " and the
city lieth four-suuare"
