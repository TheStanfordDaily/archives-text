The dining room and hallway of
Roble were crowded to ihe full

It was the first eventof Commence

least enjoyable.
Refreshments were served up

most enjoyable parts of the after

was placed in one corner of the
lobby and strains of music floated
through the crowded rooms. The
Women's Glee Club also sang two
