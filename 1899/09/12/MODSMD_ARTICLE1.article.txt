# FOOTBALL PROSPECTS.
## Men Who Will Do Battle on the Stanford Gridiron This Season. 
### 
Coach Chamberlain arrived on
the campus Thursday afternoon,
and was met at the Palo Alto depot
by a large delegation of students.
Chamberlain conies to us with the
highest recommendations. He was
captain and tackle of last year's
varsity at Yale and won especial
attention through his qualities of a
leader and coach. As tackle on the
All-America team lie has become
probably the best known athlete in
the East, lie is a very accurate
and skillful punter, and will en
deavor to develop a good kicking
fullback from the new material.
Chamberlain is brim full of enthusi
asm and is just the man to stir up
a team of players. The foothal'
management have the fullest con
fidence in bis ability as a coach and
will give him their hearty support.
Only three of last year's Varsity
have returned to the University this
year and the other places will have
to be filled by new men. Following
is a summary of the material on
hand:
Chester G. Murphy, Varsity cap
tain for 18IK), is one of the most
consistent players we have had in
the football ranks. He has been
Varsity quarter - back for three
years, having made the team in his
freshman year. Murphy prepared
at the Willamette University, and
was captain and quarter-back of the
ctil lege team for two years previous
to his entering Stanford.
Murphy is an all-round athlete
ami has won sweaters in three col
lege events — baseball, football, and
track. He has been in the left field
on the Varsity for two years and
took third place in the bicycle race
of the intercollegiate field-day two
years ago.
Garth Parker, '1)9, who played
right end last year, has been on the
Varsity for two years, lie is a
strong player and will add much
strength to this year's team.
A. H. Rice, '02, went into the
game last year when Smith retired.
He has had considerahie experience
as an end and plays a good game.
The second eleven men who will
be back this year are MeFadden.
Bentley, Cairns, Bidwell, Nourse,
Sell, Beckley, and Farris. In addi
tion to these "Babe" Burnett, center
<ui the '97 Varsity, "Guiby" Dole,
Leavitt, and Wrigley will return to
the University as soon as their dis
charges are granted.
It is impossible to say anything
at present concerning the new mate
rial. A call lias been made by
Captain Murphy for all men who
intend to play this year to meet in
Encina lobby. This will give the
management a chance to size up
the new material.
Manager Berry has had the
grounds worked over and sprinkled
and they are now in good condi
tion. Practice in punting and
handling the ball will begin to
morrow afternoon. Suits were
given out to the old men todav The
management especially urge that
all men who are heavy enough to
plav in the line will get out im
mediately, even if they have had no
previous experience at the game.

The schedule of practice games
with the team from the Olympic
Club will he arranged tomorrow.
It is probable that eight games will,
he played, one on our own campus.
L"he season will open the last of
this month with a game between
Berkeley and the Olympics.
