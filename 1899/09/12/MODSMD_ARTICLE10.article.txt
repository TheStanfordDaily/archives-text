The action of a few students in
Encina last week in an effort to re
vive the custom of Sophomore-
Freshman rushing has been gener
ally condemned by upper-class men
in the University. It is known
outside of University circles that
rushing is forbidden at Stanford,
and this fact is an inducement to
many new students to enter. It is
therefore the duty of all Stanford
men to see that this provision is
not violated. We understand that
the faculty committee will allow
this case to pass as a first offense,
but any further demonstrations will
cause the participants to be severely
dealt with.
