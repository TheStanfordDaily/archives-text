When Mrs. Stanford made her
last great gift to the University at
the beginning of the last vacation,
she effectually removed any doubts
which may have existed —which
did exist —as to the permanency of
the institution on its present basis.
Few of us who are now here were
present during the troublous times
that antedated the winning of the
Stanford suit before the United
States Supreme Court, when the
very life of the University seemed
threatened ; so, perhaps, we may
only barely realize what a change
has come over the prospects of Stan
ford University. But now that
Mrs. Stanford's munificence has

forever placed the University be
yond the possibility of cramped
means, we can all realize, especially
with the object lesson of the great
buildings going up about the old
(2uad, that Stanford is on the way
toward the fulfillment of its destiny
as one of the greatest institutions
of learning in the country.
