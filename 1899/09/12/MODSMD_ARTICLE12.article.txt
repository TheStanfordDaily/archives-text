With the opening of the football
season, the arrival of Coach Cham
berlin, and the favorable outlook
for a Stanford victory on the grid
iron on next Thanksgiving Day,
there comes through our football
manager news which brings a cold
shudder to every loyal Stanford
student. It is nothing more nor
less than that some half a dozen of
our most promising football men
have declared their intention of not
entering football practice.
We should like to enquire of this
same half dozen of our men with
what it is they expect our football
management, captain, and coach to
mold out a team that will wipe out
a defeat of 22-0, and Cardinal's
first defeat at that? Are they to do
it outof putty ? Where is that spirit
that would or.ce bring out a man
to battle for his alma mater when
all looked dubious and there was
no money to provide a soft field, a
trainer, and all the luxuries and
necessities of a properly practiced
team? What has become of that
will to do or die once shown on our
campus gridiron, preparing our
men for victories of 28 to 0 and the
like? Are those of us who are able
to help going to stand by and
watch our men go down to defeat
and degradation, all for the sake of
some unimportant whim? For
shame, no! What matter if you do
not expect to make the varsity the
first season you are out? Is a foot
ball team which represents a col
lege so little sacred that you would
have a man win a place on it with
out half trying? If it is let us give
up intercollegiate matches in the
manly sports and challenge our
rivals to a game of marbles.
Come, men who can play foot
ball, put your shoulders to the
wheel wiih those who are already
there and we shall carry old Stan
ford to the place in football she oc
cupied before.
