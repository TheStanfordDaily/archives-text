### 
Rev. J. W. Dinsniore of San Jose
delivered the first of the regular
Sunday sermons in the chapel
Sunday morning, lie took for his
text the twelfth verseof thp sixtieth
chapter of Isaiah â€”" Korthe nation
and kingdom that will not serve
Thee shall perish." The speaker
dwelt at some length upon the low
state of morals of the municipal
governments of this country, and
urged able men to take a more active
part in the affairs of the state. He
said in part:
" It is not the small householder
who complains of hard times and
unjust treatment, it is the loafer who
demands everything in common
and is never at any time ready to
do his share.
"Cities are the breeding places of
discontent. They are usually con
trolled by aliens who have no prop
erty and pay nothing for the sup
port of the municipality. There
are noble men in all cities, but
there is no concentrated effort be
tween them to make their influence
felt. The temptations of private
business are too strong to allow
tliein to mix in political affairs.
" The only remedy for these evils
is a speedy return to the command
ments of God, working a change in
men themselves which will make
them wish to do the best they can.
The hope of a renovation through
pol tical action is little more than a
dream. The stafe cannot enforce
the religious observance of the Sab
bath, but, for civil reasons, it should
always enforce the legal observance.
To reform society it is useless to kill
or imprison those who violate the
rules of society. The reform should
begin at the core. Set a policeman
inside of the man himself and it
will do him some good. Strengthen
the institutions and safeguards of
society. Plant schools, colleges,
universities, and churches. This is
our duty, and we are impelled to
fulfill it not only through our reli
gion but through patriotism."
