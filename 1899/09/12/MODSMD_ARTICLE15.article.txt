The Christian Association opened
the year with special services in the
chapel Sunday evening. Rev. E. S.
Chapman of Oakland was present

and delivered an excellent talk
upon the subject, "The World's
Bible." He said: "There are two
distinct Bibles. One the Christian's
Bible, and the other the world's
Bible. The latter is the Christian
people, and it is being read con
tinually by the world at large.
The world studies it and is influ
enced by it where it could not be
influenced by or understand the
Christian's Bible.
"The Christian is the revelation
of the Christian's Bible, and you
do not have to urge people to read
the sermons you live. The Chris
tian has a perfect rule — the Bible,
a perfect example, the Christ ; and
a perfect guide, the indwelling di
vine spirit."
The speaker then likened the
Christian to a compositor setting
type for some important book.
Where Bibles are published, for in
stance, no visitors are allowed in
the composing rooms, and only the
best of compositors are employed.
The Christian should take great
care that he makes no mistake in
his part of the World's Bible.
