was the election of Theodore Hoover,

mittee caused by the resignation of
S. M. Ballantyne, '01. who will not
return to college. Fred L. Berry,
football manager, brought before the
committee an account of his efforts
toward the securing of grounds in
the city for the Thanksgiving game
and eight practice games, with a
discussion as to the feasibility of
making a two-year contract for the
Folsom-street grounds. The com
mittee deferred action on Mr. Berry's
report until a further investigation
is made.
