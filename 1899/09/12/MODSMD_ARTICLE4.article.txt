# MRS. STANFORD'S GREAT GIFT.
## With an Account of Her Provisions for the Future Government of the University. 
### 
Shortly after the commencement
exercises that made of '99 a gradu
ating class, the educational world
received news of a gift to the cause
of learning that rivalled the Rocke
feller endowments to the University
of Chicago. Mrs. Stanford, our
munificent benefactress, deeded land
and moneys to the University ag
gregating in value over fifteen
millions of dollars. Of this $10,-
000,000 is in stocks and bonds, and
the remainder of the sum of $10,-
417,000 in property.
Mrs. Stanford called the trustees
together on May 31st to express to

them h'er ideas for the future man
agement of the University. Among
the most important changes was
one making the Board of Trustees
a governing body with control over
the finances and general policy of
the University. Provision was
made that in the future the Hoard
should not exceed fifteen members
with a ten year term of office and
that it he organized with President,
Vice-President, and an Executive
and Finance Committee, each to
hold office for one year. Charles,
(1. Lathrop, Mrs. Stanford's brother
was appointed permanent Treasurer
and Business Manager. Among
other provisions made by Mrs.
Stanford at the time of the gift
were the following:

No private or public house shall
i be erected on the campus as a stu
dent boarding or lodging house,
except under the control of the
Trustees; and no private house
I shall be erected on the campus
I which is less than $4000 in value.
No summer school shall be es
tablished or maintained at the
University, or have the use of the
University name.
No residences shall be permitted
to encroach on the grounds needed
for the University,or be built north
of Alvarado Row, or between that
Row and the Quadrangle, or be
tween Roble Hall, Dr. Jordan's res
idence, and the Museum.
Societies and associations of stu
dents in erecting houses 011 the
campus must make them of at
tractive exterior, and at a mini
mum cost of $6000.
The selection, appointment, and
1 removal of instructors and allques
j tions relating thereto shall be made
iand determined by the President of
the UDiversity.
The charge of registration fees
1 has proved advantageous and is to
be continued always.
I he provision which excited most
comment was that forever limiting
the number of women attendingthe
University to five hundred. Dr.
Elliott has discussed this in the
j first issue of the Stanford Alumnux.
Mrs. Stanford's view of the matter
is expressed in the following words:
" I have watched with interest
the large growth in the attendance
of female students, and if this
growth continues in the future at
the same rate, the number of women
students will, before very long,
J greatly exceed the number of men,
and thereby have it regarded by
the public as a University for fe
males instead of males. This was
not my husband's wish, nor is it
mine, nor would it have been my
son's. "
