The Univeksity is in full swing
again with better prospects than
ever before. Those who saw merely
the foundations of the Memorial
Arch when they went away last
May, have come back to find the
tower well-nigh finished and a gen
eral air of work hovering about the
old Quad that in former years was
given over to drowsy bees and the
lone gardener that tends the flower
beds. This atmosphere of energy
has seemed to characterize the first
few days of college more than ever
before, because, although there was
a larger entering class, the working
of the different departments has
begun promptly. The student in
terests are ahead, the Football field
is ready for practice, the coach has
come, and the prospects are bright.
The Daily Palo Alto renews its
acquaintance with the old students
and extends hearty greeting to the
new.
