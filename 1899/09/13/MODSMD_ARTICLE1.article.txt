### 
The football meeting Monday
evening was well attended both by
players and enthusiastic students.
After a few remarks by Captain
Murphy, Coach Charnberlin was
introduced. Mr. Charnberlin
spoke earnestly yet hopefully. He
urged everyone to come out for
practice. He spoke of his own un
willingness to don the padded suit
until his junior year, and the sur
prise that he felt at being able to
make the team.
"I'm not telling this because I
did it,'' the speaker continued;
"many of you here can do as well if
you will but try. If a man is physi
cally unable, we cannotexpect any
thing of him, but every man that
is sound in body, should appear on
the field regardless of experience,
and we'll make him able to play
the game."
