For the benefit of all new stu
dents, the editor of the Daily Palo
Alto wishes to announce that there
are always places on the editorial
board of this paper for students
who desire to do journalistic work,
and that all applicants for positions
will he welcomed and carefully con
sidered.
Work on the Daily Palo Alto
has probably brought to those do
ing it more remuneration in the
way of honor and practical educa
tion than has any other line of stu
dent activities. The whole student
body look upon those whose names
appear daily on the editorial page
as students who are anxious to im
prove excellent opportunities and
who are doing something for their
college. In yesterday's issue there
appeared an account of what some
of the men who have formerly
worked upon this paper are now do
ing on San Francisco papers.
Others have not entered into actual
journalistic work, but they are
finding their journalistic experience
gained here of almost equal advan
tagc.
Tomorrow afternoon, at 1:30
o'clock, there will be a meeting in
the office of this paper of all who
desire to enter upon this work this
semester. All old as well as all
new students who wish to work
should be present and a general un
derstanding will be gained between
the members of the editorial board.
It is hoped that persons who wish
to ally themselves with the paper
this semester will be present at this
meeting.
