Annually it devolves upon this
paper to point out to the student
body the urgent necessity of paying
promptly the annual assessment of
one dollar, which is levied for the
support of the Associated Students,
which in its centralized functions
supports the various student inter
ests of the University â€”foothall,
baseball, track athletics, tennis,
women's athletics, chess, debate,
and musical organizations. So far
this year only four hundred stu
dents have paid this obligation,
and it is evident that many do not
realize the importance of its imme
diate settlement. The student body
has a small balance in the treasury,
but is under great expense in the
preliminary outfitting of the foot
ball team, in preparing the football
field for practice, in procuring an
efficient coach and trainers, and in
equipping the University Band, so
that every dollar received adds to
the facilities for giving superior
training to the team. Besides foot
ball, there are the other student
body interests which deserve sup
portand attention. Athletics alone
does not absorb all the student body
resources, but debating and chess
are also nourished, and these intel
lectual activities i-h mid have the
support of those who imagine that
the one lonely dollar asked from
every student for their own associa
tion goes entirely for football, and
for that reason say most decidedly,
" I am not interested in football
nor in athletics, and I won't pay
it." College patriotism and college
good demands that every student
take an active part in the life of the
college, and paying the student
body assessment is one way of
manifesting such an interest. Col
lectors will be announced as soon
as the delinquent list is made up.

ing to pa} r , the editors of the Daily
