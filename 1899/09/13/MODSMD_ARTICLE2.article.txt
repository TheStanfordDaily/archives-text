# The
						Agassiz Expedition.

### 
C. E. Oilman, '01, who started
with the Agassiz Geological expe
dition for .South America at the end
of last semester, returned to the
University Saturday after a very
successful as well as an exciting
trip.
Sir. Oilman, while declining to
give the exact result of the trip mi
til Dr. Branner's return, spoke
readily of the many events of his
lonir ton r.
The party left Stanford May 8,
1899, and after spending three days
in Washington and four in New

York, gave what remained of their
time to a visit at Cambridge, Mass. i
On May 20th, the party sailed from
New York harbor on the Coleridge,
en route for Pernatnbuco.
As the vessel left the harbor, she
floated at her mast-head a twenty
foot stamped flag made by Mrs.
Collins, and as the little party
swung away from land they re
ceived a merry salute from the
many steamers and barges that were
lying near in the harbor. "It was
a jolly voyage," says Mr. Oilman,
"in which an attempt to initiate
the lubbers at the crossing of the
line failed badly, for the Stanford
gang rushed the crew and the plot
was foiled."
"The party was detained two
days at Pernambuco by the gov
ernment, but was finally allowed
to nail. The coast was thoroughly
examined as far north as Natal
and Rio Grande del Norte and here
the little boat, Vascasa, was so
had ly wrecked that, they were
j obliged to leave her and return to
Pernambuco by steamer.
At this place Havens and B. Col
lins returned, R. Collins went to
Peru, leaving Dr. Branner with
Greeley, ' I JB, ami Ed. Oilman, 'OL.
Greeley was sent to Marceo to work
and collect coral reefs, while Oil
man worked for a week on some
rare maps at the Archeological In
stitute of which Dr. Branner is an
honorary member.
At the end of this time Dr. Bran
ner and Oilman started on a 200-
tnile tramp to Marceo to join
Greeley, and after a long struggle,
sleeping in the rain, eating but
little, and at one time arrested and
tried by a judge for geologizing and
doing other things which he (the
judge) did not understand, they
found their fellow sufferer keeping
house alone at Marceo, and anx
iously awaiting their coming.
After a week there, the three re
lumed to Pernambuco, and thence
by steamer to the States. Dr.
Branner will arrive here about
Sept loth.
Even the return was full of dan
ger. Five hundred miles south of
the Barbadoes the Wordsworth
blew up, killing the engineer and
scalding the fireman. For thirteen
days the vessel drifted until she at
last ran into Bridgetown Harbor
on that island. Another steamer
was taken and the party at last
arrived at New York, having
viewed on the way the horrible
wreck caused by the hurricane in
the West Indies. Mr. Oilman
characterizes it as "a fine, interest
ing trip, with good results and
many valuable specimens.''
