The chapel was Hlled Monday
evening to hear Mips Annie G.
Ly!e, '95, who has been pursuing
graduate work at .Johns Hopkins
University for the last two years,
speak on ''Some Recent Investiga
tions of the Theories of Sleep and
Hypnotism."
She began by stating some of
the ancient theories of the philos
ophers and metaphysicians regard
ing sleep. These were very fanci
ful and far-fetched, due to the lack
of knowledge of anatomy.
Just what change takes place in
sleep is not known. The brain
alone sleeps, all the other organs
may be active. Sieep, it has been
found by experiment, is deepest
during the first three hours. There
are various modern theories of
sleep—the chemical theory —that
sleep is due to a chemical change
in the blood brought out by fatigue.
The histological theory, that sleep
is produced by the shrinking of the
nerve cells through fatigue, this
breaking the nerve connection and
producing sleep.
The theory, however, that has
had the most vogue is the vaso
motor theory which rests on the
theory of brain departments. The
vaso-motor department which con
trols the movements of the body
with its nerves becomes fatigued,
the nerves lose their tone and re
lax, allowing a large quantity of
blood to be drawn from the brain
and sleep is produced, due to lack
of blood in the brain.
But no single theory of sleep can
fully explain all the different phe
nomena of sleep, for during sleep
there are chemical, histological,
and vaso-motor changes taking
place, and no one theory can dis
prove of the other.
