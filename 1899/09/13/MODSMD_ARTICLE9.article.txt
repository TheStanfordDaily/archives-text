In this issue is presented the
last report of the student body
treasurer for last year, showing the
sound basis on which is left the
finances of the student body â€”
due almost wholly to his activ
ity and careful management. In
spite of obstacles and difficulties
Treasurer Fickert left an enviable
record as an able business man, and
the showing of the year is a suffi
cient indication of the success of his
administration. The balance of
$1500 in the treasury includes the
debt of $150 due the student body
from the musical clubs, which
leaves the available cash balance
about $1350, which is more than
double the balance left at the end
of any previous year.
