Berry and Baseball Manager Has
lacher were present to discuss the
question of athletic grounds in the
city. For football it was agreed in
view of all the facts of the case that
the Sixteenth and Folsom street
grounds were the most practicable
as it was impossible to get Central
or Recreation Park. The Presidio
and v.ilen Park were judged un
available on account of the lack of
transportation facilities. The Fol
som street grounds are accessible—
within three blocks at the farth
est —by three different car lines.
These grounds are under the con
trol of the Mechanics Institute, and
the committee in charge of them
wants a two years' contract to in
sure the Institute against the loss
that would result from a year's
lease, in view of the extensive im
provements tint t mre to be put in.
It will he necessary to till in a
large part of the grounds and erect
a covered grandstand before they
will be up to the requirements.
After discussing the question of a
two years'contract at a tixed sum,
the committee empowered Mr.
Berry to act with Berkeley's man
ager for a two years' lease if the two
deem it altogether advisable. By
the two-year contract the student
body saves considerable on the
rental, and has a ground fixed for
next ye r, when available parks
will be even more scarce.
Manager Haslacher spoke of his
efforts to secure Recreation Park
for the baseball season, finding it
unavailable. lie and Mr. Berry
will act together in trying to secure
a combination lease for both
sports.
Berry then spoke on the question
of a trainer. Stanford has never
yet had a regular athletic trainer
and has always been sorely in need
of one. At best, all of her previous
men were merely rubbers and con
ditioners. During the past year
through the efforts of Dr. Wood,
Dr. Angell and Mr. Berry, the
question of a trainer has been ex
haustively looked into, and such
men as Moulton of Minnesota, Con
nors of Cornell, McMasters of Har
vard, Stagg of Chicago, and
Graham of the Boston Athletic
Club have been interviewed. The
man finally decided on is Murphy,
graduate of the University of Penn
sylvania Medical Department, and
brother of 44 Mike" Murphy, the
trainer of all Pennsylvania's suc
cessful athletic teams. Murphy has
had in addition to bis course in
medicine the advantage of all his
brother's knowledge and methods.
Dave Brown, '97, ex-football and
track manager, is in the East now,
attending to the negotiations which
it is hoped will bring Murphy
here. The proposition that he
made has been accepted by the com.

miitee and a telegram to that ef
fect has been sent East. The com
mittee also empowered Mr. Berry
io negotiate with McLeod, hist
year's trainer, for terms for the full
athletic year, as a rubber for all
the teams.

ed editor of the Sequoia in place of
