The baseball nine will go to San
Jose on Saturday and will cross
bats with the professional team ol
that city in an exhibition game,
the proceeds to he given to charity.
As many of the freshman players
as possible will be given an oppor
tunity to play and for this reason
it is desirable that all new men
meet Captain Strohn at once. Some
plan of fall practice will he fol
lowed in order to have the men
keep themselves in condition. Of
last year's team the following have
returned to college: Strohn, Lana
gan. Murphy, Lougheed, Edwards.
Swindells will be debarred from
playing because of his having
joined the professional ranks.
