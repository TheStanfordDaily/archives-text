# "IN TERMS OF LIFE."
## Professor Thoburn's Sermons and Talks. 
### 
During the past summer the vol
ume of Professor Thohurn's ser
mons and lecture talks, for which
arrangements were made last May,
has been published. The result is
a handsome book of 240 pages,
printed on deckle-edge paper with
gilt top, the presswork and mechan
ical execution being of the highest
excellence. The book bears the im
print of the University, and was
executed at the M unlock Press, San
F ranciseo.
The volume contains an admir
able half-tone portrait of Professor
Thoburn. The contents are six of
his most characteristic sermons in
the University chapel, an unfin
ished fragment ot a sermon in
course of preparation at the time
of his death, and nine fragments of
lectures given in his course on the
'' Life and Teachings of Christ."
There is also an appendix, contain
ing the memorial addresses of Presi
dent Jordan, Professor Murray, and
Dr. Elliott, and the sonnet of Mr.
Hutchinson, originally published
in the Palo Alto Live Oak.
Regarding this volume, one of
Professor Thohurn's old students
writes: " 1 have read two-thirds of
the fragments of syllabi and ser
mons already today, and 1 want to
express my thanks to you for taking
pains to put these into form that
Dr. Thohurn's former students can
keep and enjoy. The reading this
afternoon has been like a whiff
from the old friendship and life,
and has called forth the pleasure,
the zest, the helpfulness, i-nd it
must he owned, the questionings
that Dr Thohurn's original style of
teaching used to bring me. In
sending out his picture with these
words of his, you have done us all
a favor. I should think every for
mer Stanford man and woman
would want to have a copy."
Another writes: "It makes me
unspeakably happy to think that
our dear Dr. Thoburn is to live in
this book â€” is so a part of him. I
had feared that it would be a dis
appointment to us who had listened
to him and had learned to love his
gentle. Christlike manner of speak
ing, hut they bring him before one,
and one can almost hear his voice."
Mr. George Hamlin Fitch, re
viewing the book in the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, calls it "one of the
most helpful hooks that has been
issued for a long time." He says:
"These sermons and talks cover
many subjects, hut they reveal on
every page the homely strength of
a faith, rooted deep in love of his
fellow man and desire to aid all
who were struggling for light and
leadir.g. In this passion for aiding
others with spiritual help and sug
gestion, he reminds one strongly of
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, who built up
the kindergartens in this city and
whose influence for good was greater
than that of any preacher of her
time. His religion is a vital re
ligion, which many a preacher,
bound by the forms of creed and
coldly sterile in his spiritual na
ture, would find it impossible to
live up to. His book, mere frag
ment as it is of the work which he
might have given us had strength
been granted him to continue his
work, will he an active influence
for good, for it is full of the power
that comes of unselfish thought,
fused to while heat by the spiritual
fires that are fed by helpfulness
and high purposes."
The volume is on sale at the
Reuistrar's office and at the Uni
versity Bookstore.
