Old students in general are
aware that one of the unwritten
rules for students forbids walking
across the gridiron. Freshmen do
not seem to he aware of this and
have not allowed their common
sense to tell them that a soft field
breaks no hones. On the contrary
a hard beaten path may. And if
the harrow has had ;i chance to ob
literate the old paths, there is no
need to run the risk of starting m
new one.
