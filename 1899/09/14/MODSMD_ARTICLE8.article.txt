It is seldom that a student at the
University hits the opportunity to
hear such a man as Dr. L. F.
Ward, who offers two lecture
courses at the University this se
mester, beginning with Oct. 11th.
Dr. Ward is recognized as the lead
ing American sociologist, holding,
as he does, the same position in
that subject as Dr. .Jordan does in
ichthyology. Dr. Ward has given
the courses which he will offer to
the students of sociology here, in
three universities: University of
Chicago, University of West Vir

Washington, 1). C.
This man is not only a polished
lecturer, who stands at the head of
his specialty, but ranks high as a
student in branches totally differ
ent, his work in geology, alone, being
sufficient to bring him into prom
inence. It is of such men that ideal
college professors are made.
