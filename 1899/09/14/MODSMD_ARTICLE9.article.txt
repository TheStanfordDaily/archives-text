# Joaquin Miller's Lecture.
## 
### 
The first, of the regular Tuesday
evening lectures proved very pop
ular; so much so, in fact, that
standing room was at a premium
and many persons were unable to
get into the chapel. The lecture,
as announced, was "A Winter in
the Klondike," lÂ»y ''the poet of the
Sierras," Joaquin Miller, to he
given in costume. After an intro
ductory t;ilie on the use of words,
in which considerable humor was
introduced, and the reading of some
of the author's verses, Mr. Miller
retired to ioeante-room and donned
his Klondike suit of furs. The re
mainder of the time was spent with

the thrilling account of Miller's
t ip to the gold regions, in company
with two University of California
men, all of them having been sent
by the Examiner-Journal syndicate
to get the facts ah< lit the Alaskan
gold discoveries. After enduring
terrible hardships, including all
the dangers of a winter in the open
on the Yukon, lie returned to the
United States and gave his experi
ences to the world. Me found the
gold many times more abund
ant than in California, but many
more times less accessible. The
account of the difficulties encount
ered with a real live dog team was
very graphic.
