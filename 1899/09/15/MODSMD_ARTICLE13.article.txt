The proposition to give the Stan
ford volunteers a reception on the
quadrangle is a good one and
should receive the encouragement
and support of the entire student
body. When the call was made
for volunteers a year ago last May,
the Stanford men responded readily,
and though each of them knew at
the time that he was leaving one of
the pleasantest periods of his life
he did not hesitate to undertake
what he believed lo be his duty.
The same spirit which led Stanford '
men to seek victory on the gridiron |
and oval took them to the front in
their country's battles. We are
proud of the record our boys made
at Manila and we will welcome
them back to the old quad again.
A promenade concert, probably the
last college event witnessed by the:
men before their departure, is a!
fitting entertainment for their re
turn. The committee in charge
should receive every encouragement i
from the student body in the prep- j
aration for the coming event, and i
next Friday should be a gala day
at Stanford.
