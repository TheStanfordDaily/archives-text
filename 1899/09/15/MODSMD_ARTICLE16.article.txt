# The
						Hopkins Galapagos Expedition.
## 
### 
This expedition, which left San
Francisco October 3. 1898, on the
schooner Julia E. Whalen, Captain
William Moves, returned to port
last Friday after an absence of over
ten months. The members of the
expedition were It. E. Snodgrass,
'99, and Edward Heller, '00, of the
Zoology department. Biological ex
plorations were made of all the
islands of the Galapagos archipel
ago and several neighboring ones.
Representative collections of the
mammalia, birds, reptiles, fishes,
insects, mollusca, eschinoderms,
plants, and petrography of each
island were secured, and the char
acteristics of the fauna, flora, and
geology studied.
The expedition arrived atGuada
lupe Island, off the coast of Lower
California,on November 10th. But
a short time was spent here, as the
island has already been thoroughly
investigated.
Clipperton Island was reached
three weeks later. The island is of
coral and built upon a submerged
volcanic mass. It is circular in
outline, with a central lagoon, on
one side of which projects a sharp
crystalline rock, the remnant of the
island upon which the coral have
built. Clipperton is remarkable as
being the only coral island in the
eastern Pacific.
The northernmost Galapagos isl
ands were sighted on December 10.
1898. The archipelago consists of
fifteen islands, the largest eighty
miles long by twenty wide, some of
the smaller ones but n few miles in
diameter. They lie directly under
the equator, 600 miles west of the
Ecquadorian coast. The group is
volcanic, and most of the islands
possess well formed craters of geo
logically recent date. The type
island consists of a large central
crater several miles in diameter,
which has poured out immense
quantities of lava into the sea. Al
bemarle, the largest island of the
group, is composed of five such
islands, which are collected now by
low isthmuses, it contains the
largest crater, which has a diameter
of seven miles. Geologically the
islands are similar to the Hawaiian
group, but the craters are smaller
and let-s active. The surface is
mostly rough lava fields, perfectly
destitute of vegetation, except on the
weather side, where the moist south
cast trade winds have disintegrated
the lava and formed a rich soil.
The archipelago is remarkable
for its reptile life. It is the home
of the galapagos or gigantic land
tortoise, a remnant of tertiary times
which has been preserved, while on
the continent it has become ex
tinct. Formerly each island of the
group had its peculiar species of
galapagos, hut now the race is
nearly extinct, being restricted to
but two islands. The tortoise are
vegetarians, feeding on grass and
cactus, and are said to live for sev
eral centurus, growing continually
throughout their life. The largest
secured by the expedition weighs
about GOO pounds, but others, esti
mated to weigh 2,000 pounds, with
a carapace four feet high, have been
seen. Another remarkable reptile
is a marine iguana or lizard, which
lives in the sea, feeding on algae, for
which it dives. It attains a length
of from four to six feet, and is the
only marine lizard known to science.
Chatham Island, the only one
inhabited, supports a population ol
about 200 Ecuadorians, who are
engaged in the culture of sugar
cane and coffee.
Two active volcanoes were ob

served during the time the party
were on the islands. One remained
active for some months, covering an
area of several miles with lava ; the
other volcano has been active for
years, and pours a continuous
stream of lava into the sea.
From the Galapagos Archipelago
the party sailed for Cocos Island,
off the coast of Panama. Several
days in July, 1899, spent ex
ploring the cocoanut and fern thick
ets of the island. Cocos is remark
able for its wealth of tradition in
regard to buried treasure of Spanish
pirates.
The collections of the expedition
consist of six barrels and five tanks
of fish, several tanks of reptiles,
1,500 birdskins, several thousand
insects, 100 mammals, several hun
dred molluscs, and a representative
collection of plants and rocks.
