## Dr. Jordan's Summer Trip. 
### 
A Stanford party consisting of
President and Mrs. Jordan, with
Professors Richardson, Cubberly,
Swain, Kellogg, Guido Marx, and
Associate Librarian Babine, spent
the summer at the head of King's
River Canyon, in the high Sierras.
The time was spent in hunting,
fishing and climbing mountain
peaks.
The party climbed many of the
great peaks in the neighborhood,
several of which have never been
climbed before. They made the
ascent of Mount Stanford, 14,000
feet high. Mt. Stanford was
named by Professor Brown, who
made the ascent for the first time
last year.
Mrs. Jordan and another mem
ber of the party climbed a difficult
peak which was named for Mrs.
Jordan.
The party made sketch maps
and collected scientific data, which
will be published later by the
Sierra Club. They also took photo
graphic views from the top of Mt.
Stanford, which were the first to be
taken from that peak.
