Why not
have your stationery stamped
from a die indicating 'the college
you attend, or class or fraternity
you belong to? It shows char
acter and stamps the individual.
I have in stock a large number
of these dies and «i!l make (free
of any charge whatever) any
other you may desire, provided
you place a small order for sta
tionery, to be stamped from
same. Samples, estimates, or
