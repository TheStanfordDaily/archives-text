The baseball team played a prac
tice game with tbe San Jose pro
fessionals last Saturday. The game
was merely a try-out for the Var
sity nine, and none of the old men
were up to the standard. In the
last of tbe sixth inning Captain
Strobn injured his hand in catching
a foul and was compelled to retire
from the game. Cowden, '02, was
then placed behind the bat and
tilled the position fairly well. The
game was called off at the seventh
inning to allow tbe Stanford men to
catch tbe 5:30 train.
The batting of the Stanford team
was very weak, only two bits hav
ing been received from Anderson.
The game ended with the score 8-0
infavorof San Jose. The manager
of the San Jose team is anxious to
arrange a schedule of games to be
played between the tvvo teams this
fall.
Following is the line-up in Satur
day's game: Strobn, catcher; Lan
agan, pitcher; Bentley, tirst base;
Cowden, second base; Edwards,
third base; Lougheed, shortstop;
Murphy, center field; Rodolph, left
field; and Lowenthal, right field.
