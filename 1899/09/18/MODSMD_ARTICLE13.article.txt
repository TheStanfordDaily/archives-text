The Senior Class is to be congrat
ulated on its decision to continue
the custom set by last year's class
of wearing some distinctive mark
throughout the senior year. The
sombrero worn by the seniors of '99
proved very satisfactory and the
Class of 1900 could do no better
than to adopt this as llieir emblem
and thus make the sombrero the
recognized mark of seniors at Stan
ford.
