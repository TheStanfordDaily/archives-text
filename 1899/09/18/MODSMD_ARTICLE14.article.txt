Thk announcement was made
last week of the competition auth
orized by the Executive Committee
for the best football songs and
yells. Many persons do not realize
how much depends on good singing
and yelling, and in the matter of
football songs Berkeley has gener
ally excelled us on account of the
longer time that intervenes between
the opening of college and the
Thanksgiving game. This year,
although the final day of competi
tion is not far off, the committee in
charge of the song book has done
widely, for although it has placed a
near limit on the submission of
matter, it will be enabled to get
the book out in time for any and
everyone to learn the words of the
songs long before the game. All
those who are thinking of con
tributing or entering the competi
tion should bear in mind that many
new and good songs are needed, for
by the catastrophe of last year,
some of the old ones are especially
inappropriate. For instance, we
can no longer yell to the four
winds that "we never let slip of
the championship." Also in the
matter of slogans, the axe yell—
again on account of last year's land
slide —is not in good taste any
more. We need new yells and new
songs, and we need to know them.
The first step toward these ends is
to have everyone who can send
yells and songs to the committee
to do so as soon as possible. Do
not wait until the last day.
