Boating at Harvard will gain a
fresh impulse from its victory over
Yale. The crimson desires to even
things up a little, as defeat had be
come a second nature to her crew.
Harvard is particularly strong at
tennis this year. Of the crack East
ern team that played at Del Monte,
Whitman, Ward, and Davis are
Harvard students, and Wright, the
interscholastic champion, expects
to enter this fall.
Circulars are being sent to stu
dents in Wisconsin colleges for

with other colleges and determina
tion of the results on study.

ley, Yale ; Prof. Benj ti. Wheeler,

herst; Prof. Howard Ayres, Cincin
nati ; Prof. George E. Mac Lean,

The international track meet be
tween the American team from Yale
and Harvard and the English team
from Oxford and Cambridge, which
was held in London last July, re
sulted in a victory for the English
universities by one event. The
Englishmen were victorious in the
quarter, the half, the mile, and the
three mile runs and the broad jump,
while the Americans won the 100-
yard dash, the I'2o hurdles, the
high jump, and the hammer throw.
All the events were closely con
tested, and the Englishmen won by
their greater endurance in the runs,
which was clearly demonstrated in
the deciding event, the three-mile
race.
