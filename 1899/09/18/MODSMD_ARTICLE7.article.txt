The chapel sermon was given
yesterday l>y Bishop Moreland of
Sacramento. After the opening
ceremonies, in which the congrega
tion took part, the Bishop an
nounced his text: 41 This is tlie life
eternal; to know Thee, the only
true God, and Jesus Christ whom
Thou hast sent."
He intended, he said, to aid his
andience to a better understanding
of the existence of the Creator, and
to do this was willing to lay aside
Church and the Bible, and consider
the question from the attitude of
an honest doubter.
There are times, he admitted,
when we are inclined to doubt even
our own existence, but we cannot
doubt that we think. "We think,
and thought craves truth. It is a
proof of the immortality of the soul,
tloit the human mind is continu
ally reaching for something yet un
attained. The postage stamp that
is not yet in our collection, is the
one which we most want to have;
it is the distant, blue mountain
peak which tanfpts us onward to
its summit."
The Bishop showed the insuffic
iency of the human thought, and
argued that there must be some
where an infinite mind to hold in
finite truth. He showed the sub
limity of the human will, yet
pointed out its limitations, and
asked: " Must there not be an
eternal and unchanging will that
from eternity to eternity chooses
and determines the right? "
The love of beauty, he continued,
is a spiritual side of man's nature;
but must there not be an infinite
spirit to comprehend infinite beau
ty? To this omnipotent spirit be
longs a fourth quality, that of in
finite and boundless love, which
the speaker considered highest and
best of all.
''The most precious of all knowl
edge," said the Bishop in closing,
"is the knowledge of God. Young
men and women, if you graduate
without knowing God, your school

work is worthless; you may be an
unabridged dictionary of knowledge
but you cannot be the man or
woman this University was in
tended to make yon. I am glad
that the Universiry is soon to have
what it has so long lackedâ€”a mag
nificent chapel, which will stand
in the midst of these buildings, and
bear witness to the eternal truth
that behind all these sciences and
studies is God, who makes himself
known in laboratories and class
rooms. . . . You train your
bodies in the gymnasium, and your
minds in the University; you must
train your spiritual natures as well.
Bring your souls to the church,
that University over which Jesus
Christ reigns as the Supreme Pres
ident, and where every rite is per
formed with true humanity."
The Bishop declared that by too
close study of the sciences the
spiritual faculties would become
atrophied; and closed, exhorting
his hearers to bear the text and
the lesson in mind.
