Thk freshman meeting is over,
and the politicians are happy. The
class has shown considerable spirit
already and it is to be commended
for its early organization. The
constitution which was adopted is
however a striking example of im
practicability of class constitutions
which are adopted before the mem
bers of the class become familiar
with the customs of the University,
and the needs of such organizations
in class events. Jf the freshmen
are to be bound by the constitu
tion adopted this afternoon they
will find themselves in trouble
until the end of their senior year.
The " Mark Kaunas" of the class
have been in evidence for more
than a week and their work was
very apparent in today's meeting.

Among other things the constitu
tion makes iron-bound rules con
cerning the appointment of com
mittees and the arrangements for
class events —rules which are
wholly new to us, and in some
cases entirely impracticable. The
constitution of the class is an im
portant part of the class organiza
tion and it should not be adopted
until the members of the class
know what they want, and the ef
forts of would-be politicians in
class affairs should be severely con
demned. The election of Mrs.
Stanford and the Board of Trustees
to honorary membership in the
class was a clever plan and the
other classes must admit that they
have been out-played. The elec
tion of a member of the student
body Executive Committee was,
however, beyond the powers of the
cliiss, as no representative of that
class is provided for on the com
mittee.
