# On a Tour of the World.
## 
### 
Georges Weulersse, Professeur
Agrege del Universite de France,
I'a lis, was the guest of Professor
K. .1. A. Davidson yesterday and
today. M. Weulersse, whose spe
cialty is Sociology, is making a
tour of the world, studying the con
ditions in the different countries.
He is traveling on a fellowship,
which is one of five that were re
cently presented to the University
of France, and which are given an
nually to enable university men to
travel abroad. The fellowships are
particularly valuable, because the
scholars of France have as a rule
seldom left home. The holders of
i he fellowships are to make no re
port to the university at the end of
their tour, but it is expected that
they will be of service in the gov
ernment of France on account of
(heir broadened outlook upon af
fairs. M Weulersse has been study
ing now for eight months in Amer
ica, and will leave soon for Japan.
