### 
The following is an account of
the work of two Stanford men in
the Philippines:
H.H..Fry,'oo, and '"Hob" Wrigley,'
'01, have been in parts of Luzon
never before visited by a white man.
Their explorations make an inter-,
ea.l.ing chapter in the history of the

war with the insurgents. Unarmed
and ignorant of any of the native
dialects these two young fellows,
accompanied hy a Minnesota vol
unteer, left Manila on November
15, 1 <S9S, and for twenty days trav
eled among strange tribes of natives
They went into the unknown re
gions 120 miles north of Manila
and to places seventy miles to the
southeast, going over rugged moun
tain trails, across rivers and small
streams, and through many towns
and villages. Everywhere they
were royally received and enter
tained. They started out with a
pass from Aquinahlo, but for live
days tln-y did not once show it and
received the same generous hospi
tality and courteous treatment from
all classes. They were always re
ceived by the president of each
town who became their personal
host, as hotels do not. exist in the
inland towns where travel is un
known. Governors of provinces
entertained them and Filipino army
officers vied with e;icii other in
doing them honor.
The president of one town sent ;i
man on a two days' journey into a
neighboring province to get some
bows and arrows used by another
tribe that he might give them to
his guests.
Their trip convinced them that
the native Filipino is a much better
man than he has been painted.
Fry and Wrigley have brought
with them from the Philippines
quite a number of curios for the
Emilia Club-room.
