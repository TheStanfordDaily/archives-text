### 
The Girls' Glee Club at its meet
ing yesterday listened to a very in
structive talk on tone and expres
sion, by Mrs. Dinsmore. The club
decided to take part in the enter
tainment in Palo Alto October 7th
for the benefit of the public library.
The try-out of the club will be held
this week under the direction of
Mrs. J. J. Morris. Sopranos espe
cially are urged to come to the try
out (announcement of which will
be made later), as it is particularly
desirable to have more voices of
this class.
