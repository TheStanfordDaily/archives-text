# Track Meeting.
## 
### 
In response to Capt. Boyd's call
for track men, a large number met
in the gymnasium this afternoon
to talk over plans for the coming
year. It was decided to carry out
a system of fall training and hold
an inter-class field-day in October.
Capt. Boyd, assisted by the older
men, will have charge of this pre
liminary training.
After short talks by Capt. Boyd
and Manager Cantwell, the men
were asked to sign their names
along with the events which they
wished to train for.
Judging from the large number
of promising men present, our
prospects for a victory on the track
next spring are very encouraging.

This year's team will be greatly
weakened by the loss of Dole, Stan
ford's crack athlete, Smith and
Williams, our stronghold in the
distances, and Prall, Hopper, and
Birtch, all point winners in last
year's meet.
