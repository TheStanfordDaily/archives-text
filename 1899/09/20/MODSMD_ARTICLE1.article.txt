# ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
## Professor Rolfe of Chicago Tells of the Life and Writings of the Great Romancer. 
### 
Every seat in the chapel was I
tilled last evening when Dr. Jordan j
introduced Prof, Rolfe of the Uni-;
versity of Chicago, who lectured on ;
Robert Louis Stevenson.
lie began by dividing all men of i
letters into three classes: First,
those who write because they de- j
light to tell stories, as Scott; second,!
didactic, those who write to teach,
as ltuskin; third, artistic, those j
who write from an aesthetic im- 1
pulse, as Browning, and Tennyson, j
Now it is possible for a writer to j
embody in himself all the principal i
features of these three classes, but J
such men are rare. Stevenson, how- j
ever, combined in himself two of;
these impulses, lie wrote from an
artistic, ie.-thetic impulse, and also
for his own pleasure. So we have
Stevenson, the literary artist, and
Stevenson, the romancer. The
artistic impulse was early developed I
in Stevenson hut the romantic na
ture was inherited. His people
were of a practical nature, but of
such a business that gave them
chance for imagination, i.e., light
louse engineers. Stevenson from
birth was frail and weak, and cvuld
not follow a profession as his par
ents desired. He went to the Edin
burgh Academy and later to the
University. What he gained in
formal knowledge would lie hard to
tell, but his powers of observation
and his experiences were sharpened,
lie now decided on authorship as
his lite work.
llis frail health forced him to
adopt a roving life, lie spent his
summers inspecting light-houses
and his winters in the Quartier
Latin, Paris. More than once he
was at death's door, but still he
was always gay and happy. He
was always writing but never
achieving any reputation.
At the age of twenty-eight he
published an account of a summer
journey, entitled ''An Inland Voy
age." This book made a strong im
pression and was soon followed by
a similar one, '' Travels with a
Donkey."
During his early years he was
continually bringing out short
stories. As a writer of short stories
Stevenson is unsurpast-ed. They
are classics. They contain a keen
psychological analysis, a gleam of
poetry, and extraordinary beauty
of style.
Stevenson also attempted essays.
He is an essayist of the same sort
as Lamb, always telling us about
himself, but witlrotit trace of ego
tism. Stevenson is the champion
of youth and youthful pleasures.
I lis essays will always be read by
the young and by those who are no
longer young but wish they were.
As a poet he bears tin* same re
lation to a great poet as his essays
do to the "Essays of Elia." But
his poetry has a (junlity of charm,
that you cannot nelp but read and
admire. His book of poems. "A
Child's Garden of Verse," is a
child's view of life. Stevenson is
the children's poet, in that he gives
to the little ones their own incep
tions instead of those grown people
read into them.

Before S'eveuson was thirty
three he had produced the most of
his works, but yet he was not widely
known; with the publishing of
''Treasure Island" came success.
Professor Holfe interspersed his
lecture with selections from Steven
son's writings and closed with a
selection from his letters as best
showing his real character.
