The Junior Class has decided to
continue the custom originated by
last year's juniors and have adopted
the plug as their class emblem.
The plug has never been a favorite
at Stanford and last year's attempt
to establish the custom here was,
with the exception of the Plug Ugly
celebration, a decided failure. If
the juniors can adopt a suitable
style of plug and wear it through
out the year, there will be some
wisdom in the scheme; but if they
are to be worn for a week and then j
discarded, it would be belter to drop
the whole thing at the beginning.
