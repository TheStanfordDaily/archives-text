After the lights went out in En
cinalast night a freshman was con
ducted to one of the bath tubs and
ducked. There was nothing very
unusual about the occurrence—the
freshman was small and inoffen
sive, and the sophomores who per
formed the ceremony jnst about
such a lot of fellows as usually turn
out at a ducking. If representa
tive sophomores took a hand in this
form of hazing, or the victims were
selected among freshmen who were
disposed to give trouble, there would
be something in the novelty of the
thing, lint it is always a little
fellow that gets the wetting.

The sophomores do their work
without fear and without reason.
They commit their class to the
charge of hazing, and in selecting
their victims among the utterly in
offensive, defeat whatever moral
benefit hazing might have —ihe
chastening of the unduly proud.
