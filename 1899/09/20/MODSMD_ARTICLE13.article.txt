In calling attention to songs and
yells there is still another point
that is worthy of consideration and
that is the manner of giving the
Stanford yell. The deficiency, if
it is such, was first brought to the
attention of the students now in
college at the last Thanksgiving
game by certain members of the
Alumni body who found they could
not yell as the undergraduates were
yelling at the time. "Yell slower,"
they said, and when it was tried it
made confusion. Now, every year
the "yell " question comes up in
one form or another, so that it has
come to seem a perennial problem,
whose sole value is to afford mater
ial for lucubration in the college
papers. One year there was advo
cated a prolonging of the final word
thus —" Stanfo-o-r-d," but it was
so much out of keeping with ''the
Palo Alto bark" that it naturally
fell as Hat as it deserved to. But
the Stanford yell is written thus:
Rah, Rail, Rah,
Rah, Rah, Rah,
Rah, Rah,
Stanford!
That is, three short "rahs" twice,
then two long ones, then the col
lege name. Perhaps it does not
matter so much that the final word
becomes " Staf'd," but when the
yell becomes:
Ra-a-ah,
Ra-a-ah,
Rah, Rab,
Staf'd,
its nature is essentially changed
from the original formula to two
long ''rahs" and two short ones. Jt
would seem that the present yell
should be modified to the older and
more effective style, if only for the
sake of avoiding confusion, and for
th* sake of marshalling all the
Alumni rooters, to whom the prts
ent yell is an abomination at the
Thanksgiving game, because then
we want our best and strongest
yelling.
