# A 						Musical Recital.
## 
### 
On Tuesday evening, Sept. 26th,
instead of the regular lecture there
will lie a musical recital in the
chapel by Miss .Meta Asher, the
brilliant young pianiste of San
Francisco, assisted by Mr. Armand
Solomon, a talented violinist. Miss
Asher, though only eighteen years
of age, is already a musician of rare
achievement As a child she was a
musical prodigy, charming San
Francisco audiences at the age of
ten with her brilliant rendering of
classic music. She was given a
place among the firs* violins in the
Saturday Morning Orchestra of San
Francisco when it was organized,
an enviable honor for one so young.
In 1595 she went to Europe and be
came a pupil of Professor Barth in
Berlin, afterwards entering the
Royal High School of Music, where
her progress won the praise of such
noted musical authorities as Joa
chim, Rudorff, and .Jacobsen. In
Paris she studied under the famous
composer, Moszkow!Â»ki A German
musical critic in speaking of Miss
Asher's playing, says: "Its distin
guishing characteristics are crystal
line clearness, rugged rhythm, ten
uous tone, perfect phrasing, and
tasteful tact."
Miss Asher visits the University
as the guest of Dr. and Mrs. Jordan,
and the courtesy of this recital is
given at their invitation.
