# STUDENT EMPLOYMENT.
## Some Facts About Student Labor of Interest to Employers and Those Seeking Work. 
### 
Through the activity of Mrs.;
Albert W. Smith, chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Student Em
ployment, and the co-operation of
the University Christian Associa
tion and others, a large number of
students have already been supplied
with work. During the past three
weeks the demand for capable men
and women has at times been so
great that the committee has been
unable to till vac ncies, and at all
times there has been a scarcity of
skilled labor. These conditions are
j probably due to the past success of
the labor exchange and to iliej
thorough preliminary canvass' for
work.
'The object of the labor exchange
is to send the right man to the
right place; to give each employer
a capable employee, and each man
the work which he can best do. It
is a medium between the student
and the employer. No fee for ser
vices is charged and no responsibil
ity for the inefficient is assumed.
In the workings of the exchange,
the satisfaction of the employer is
chiefly considered, although the
purpose of the committee is to help
deserving students.
Students who desire work may
register with Mrs. Smith at room
10 quad,between 10:15 and 11:15
daily. Persons who need students
in any capacity may address Mrs.
A. W. Smith, University, stating
the kind of work, time, place, etc.,
and feel assured that the best man
available will be promptly sent.
At present many places are filled
after personal consultation. In
general, V rs. Smith supplies work
ers for jralo Alto, and Dane Cool
idge, room 85 "The Cam})," sup
plies men for work on the campus;
but either will attend to any de
mand. J. E. McDowell, assistant
to the Registrar, will also direct
students or employers.
In the next issue of the Stanford
Sequoia there will appear an
article by Mrs. A. \V. Smith, en
titled "Confessions of the Student
Employment Committee," which
will be of peculiar va'.ue to any
who are interested in student em
ployment, as it embodies the re
sults of experience.
