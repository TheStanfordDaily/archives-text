# The 						Glee Club Try-out.
## 
### 
About forty candidates for the
(llee Club attended the try-out yes
terday, which was one of the most
interesting in years. The voices
were tested by the executive com
mittee with the aid of J. J. Morris
of I'alo Alto, the director of the
Commencement Chorus. Many of
the old members of the club w u re
present and every one was
much pleased to tiud an unusually
large number of good voices. There
was an abundance of second tenor
and lirst bass mostly of good qual
ity. A majority of the candidates
this year are men of more or less
experience in high school glees and
choruses and several have well
trained voices. There was p'enty
of good deep timbre for second bass,
the part for which there was the
most need, and it is sure of being
well upheld this season. The three
men who tried for first tenor were a
genuine surprise, all of them sing
ing above the necessary range.
Leader Riley was much pleased
with the showing and said that as
there was not enough room for
nearly all the new voices, it seemed
now the time to establish the fresh
man glee, which is a feature of
other big colleges. There is room
for both and the class this year has
plenty of material.
There being so large a number of
voices of about the same quality,
it has been decided to hold a second
trv-out of the best voices found yes
terday. Those who qualified for
this second trial and whoshould be
