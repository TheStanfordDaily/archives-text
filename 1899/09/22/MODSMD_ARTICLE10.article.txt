As in other branches of athletics,
the value of fm 11 training in tennis
should not he forgotten hy those
who are interested in that game.
Our success last year gives every
assurance that tennis will occupy
an important place among college
athletics next spring. It is a game,
however, which requires no little
amount of preparation, and noth
ing can he better to put a player in
condition for the preliminary tour
naments than hard practice during
the early fall. Most of the men of
last year have returned, and there
seem to he a number of promising
players among the new students,
if the new players will respond to
the encouragement of the tennis

manager in this mutter of fall
practice, an intercollegiate victory
for this year will he assured.
