Complaint has been made l>y
pedestrian* against Lhe appropria
tion of their path to i'alo Alto by
bicyclists. The bicycle path has
been in bad shape for several
months past, and during the sum
mer vacation it became the custom
for bicyclists to use the better path
of the pedestrians. Now, however,
the number of pedestrians using
the latter path make it unsafe for
bicyclists, and it would be well for
them to get together and see that
their path is put in proper shape.
In today's issue we publish a list
of the Stanford men who were en
gaged in the recent war with Spain.
Suggestions have been made that
some kind of memorial be erected
to these men, but as no record has
been kept of those who volunteered,
we adopt this plan of gathering the
names with the assistance of the
general student body. Ihe list as
published contains a little more
than half of those who volunteered,
and it is requested that any one
knowing Stanford volunteers whose
names are not included in the list
herein published will leave any in
formation they may have at this
office.
