## President Jordan Speaks on "Manifest Destiny" in the Chapel. 
### 
The regular Sunday sermon in ,
the chapel was delivered by Dr.
Jordan, who spoke on "Manifest
Destiny," taking for his text Mat-!
tliew, xviii, 7, "Needs that offense)
must come, but woe to that man |
by whom the offense cometh."
Offense, translated, means occa
sion for stumbling. The little
ones will be misled or led into
stumbling or even crushed in the
press. This is inevitable, but does,
not excuse the one who does it.
One of the greatest falacies is that
inevitableness excuses wrong or j
wickedness. A wrong act is one I
that hurts ourselves or others. A
wicked act is one that hurts others. |
When a certain act is inevitable,
it means that an opportunity for!
wrong exists. Woe to him who
does not refuse it. This is true of
right actions as well as wrong. He j
is none the less a, hero, who grasps
an occasion that calls for heroism. |
There is no excuse for the inevita-;
bleness of heredity. One says,
"My father drank to excess, there
fore how can 1 keep sober?" But;
your father's excuses showed his :
weakness; so do yours. You did I
not inherit his whiskey. Needs be'
that drukenness must come, but!
woe to him by whom it cometh.
Another pleads, "1 fell into temp-:
tation; don't blame me that li
fell." But Nature knows only the)
fact, not your pleading of the baby :
act. You fell, and that was an
end of it, as far as she is con
cerned.
Boys will be boys; yet the wild I
oats they sow, however inevitable,
will sprout up into the spinal
chord until they are grown through
and through.
The fool and his money are soon 1
parted; yet this does not justify
the gambler nor the highwayman j
who says, "Somebody will steal it, I
and it might as well be 1."
It is the manifest destiny of the
British Empire to possess the rich
mines and lands of the Transvaal.
Half of its people are British now.
But with Anglo-Saxon contempt
for lower races they refuse to be
come citizens of the Dutch Repub- 1
lie The little republic is plainly!
the victim of manifest destiny. Itj
may either give up its lands to j
aliens within and become British 1
by force of majority, or it may
fight for independence and be made
British by crushing force of arms.
It looks like a plain case and sure
thing. But a man with God on I
his side may be a majority.
Just so sure as the British flag:
is carried over the Hand by force
of arms, just so sure is the British
Empire condemned to death.
Greatness of power brings more
power; more power brings more
oppression; and oppression is weak
ness because the heart of man
rises against it. If you bury a
hero in his field a crop of heroes is ;
sure to spring up. Righteousness!
and justice are the so'e manifest
destiny.
The struggle for existence is
fierce and hard. Shall 1 kill you,
or you me? There is only enough
for one of us. Shall you or I fall
in the press, to lie there and be
trampled broad?

The union of men for mutual
help is possible only on a basis of
justice. The just men torm the
state, the public opinion, the cur
rent of thought, all that survives.
So lonely, isolated, tyrannic men
are disappearing. No longer does
an Alexander stride the world, or
a Caesar or Napoleon dream of Uni
versal Empire." The word of God
is together. To be together is to
be just. There is but one irresist
ible tendency in all history —the
tendency to justice, sympathy, and
right. We are told of the "great
bank of sympathy from which we
draw God's inexhaustible fund "
We are bound together for good
or for evil —the shame of one is the
shame of all, the joy of one is the
joy of all. We cannot say, "The
Anglo-Saxon has a mighty
destiny. Therefore feeble, inferior
races must not rule it or stand in
its way." "A great destiny cannot
stay its hand for a little act of
justice."
There is no inevitable war, no
righteous conquest. When war is
inevitable it is because men are
wicked. The nation of the future
is the nation which shall learn the
secret of helpfulness and justice.
It is said that among the unrecord
ed sayings of .Jesus are these words:
"Willi them that burn, with them
that are a-thirst, 1 thirst. With
them that are sick, with them that
are hungry, 1 hunger."
This forms the sound basis for
national character just as for the
character of the individual man.
Because in the long years the
Anglo-Saxon blood has produced
its share of the gentlest, humanest,
justest,and therefore most heroic
of men, 1 nave infinite faith in its
future, not because it rules the seas
or because its accents are heard in
every mart "112 trade. To be humane,
just and heroic is its manifest des
tiny, for when these cease it shall
perish from the earth. In its de
velopment needs that offense come
but woe to him by whom the offense
cometh. This is God's method of
race purification of which is written:
"The Goodness and Severity of
God."
