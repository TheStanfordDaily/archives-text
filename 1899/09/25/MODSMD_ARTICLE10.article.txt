In a recent article on football,
Walter Qainp had the following
to say in regard to Stanford's de
feat of last year:
"Differences in views and the
loss of tradition went far toward
making matters worse, and in the
j end Stanford was defeated. While
j this is hard on the wearers of the
| cardinal and hard on their coach,
! the real result of the season's play
cannot he without a salutary
effect on the game of the Pacific
Coast. Just as in the East, when
early games depended upon the
remarkable playing of individuals,
and team work was hardly more
i than a name, it took several shocks
;to show that eleven average men,
; playing upon certain well-known
defined lines and thoroughly
j molded together by the efforts of a
coach into a harmonious whole,
would simply annihilate any team
of stars, so on the Pacific Coast it
required such a lesson as this to
demonstrate the vaJue of hard
work and team piay."
These wholesome words of ad
vice might weil he heeded by both
teams on tlÂ»3 Coast.
