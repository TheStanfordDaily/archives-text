# Volunteer Reception.
## 
### 
By the reception which the Uni
versity tendered to her returned
volunteers and their guests, Stan
ford has most fittingly honored
I those who have helped to make his
tory and have sustained the Stan
ford spirit in foreign countries.
'The volunteers, about twenty-five
in number, accompanied by the
band of the 'Thirteenth Minnesota
Regiment and Major Tilden of the
First California as the guests of the
University, were met at the 8:4V)
train by a large crowd of students
land escorted to the football field to
J watch the practice. 'The largest
crowd of the year was present, it
! having been rumored that the men
j would line up, but it was impossible
'owing to the condition of the men.
'The appearance of'"Babe" Bur
nett, who had just arrived from
the South, was the occasion of pro
( longed enthusiasm.
The promenade concert on the
quad in the evening was the occa
i sion for the real welcome and re
j ception to the soldier boys. The
I interior of the quad was handsomely
: decorated with Japanese lanterns.
lln the center the band-stand had
! been erected, and in the east end of
I the quadrangle the reception com
mittee occupied two very prettily
decorated booths where the soldiers
and their friends were received and
! refreshments were served.
'The program was opened by Dr.
j Jordan who formally welcomed the
returned volunteers. He said that
it had been the [privilege of Stan
ford to send a good delegation of
her very best material to the front
!to help in making history, and he
was proud that they went as citizen
soldiers, the only kind of soldiers
for which a republic has use. lie
then extended the freedom of the
University to the guests, the
Thirteenth Minnesota Band.

J. E. Springer, '00, spoke for the
student body and welcomed the
returned volunteers on behalf of
the Associated Students. " Stan
ford is a thoroughly democratic in
stitution," he said, "and we hate
snobbishness. We are glad that
our volunteers have returned to us
as they went forth, as plain, priv
ate soldiers. The only soldier that
we recognize is the one who has
done his duty." He paid a high
tribute to Ralph Coates, '00, the
only Stanford man who fell in the
war.
Corporal John M. Switzer, '98,
responded for the soldiers. He said
in part: "We are happy to be with
you and cannot tell you how we
appreciate our reception tonight.
In Manila we had to give recep
tions to ourselves. People say we
criticise too much, but if they gave
us less excuse for criticism there
would be less." In closing, Cor
poral Switzer paid a glowing
tribute to Major Tilden, the friend
of the soldier.
Major Tilden, on being called for
said that he had been a Stanford
man ever since Dr. Jordan had be
come president. He had forty
Stanford students in bis command
and knew the stuff that they were
made of. In closing he paid a high
tribute to the college men who took
part in the war.
This ended the literary program
and the concert proper began. The
band of the Thirteenth Minnesota
Volunteers, numbering forty pieces,
is one of the finest bands in any of
the volunteer regiments. Their
selections were rendered in a very
creditable and artistic manner.
The concert was undoubtedly the
finest ever given on the quad.
The soldiers were entertained for
the night by the student body, and
most of them departed for San
Francisco on the morning train
Saturday. Most of the Stanford
volunteers will at once re-enter the
University, where their presence
on the Held and among the student
body will greatly help to build up
enthusiasm.
