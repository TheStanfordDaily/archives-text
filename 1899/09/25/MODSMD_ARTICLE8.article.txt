We are to be congratulated on
our prospect of hereafter having the
last Tuesday evening of each month
devoted to a musical, instead of the
customary lecture. While we have
always had music scattered along
through each year, yet no system
atic provision has been made to
bring here the best available mu
sical talent. Consequently, in the
rush and bustle of college duties,
some of us have been compelled to
allow our taste for the beautiful in
music to deteriorate somewhat. We
all need artistic training as well as
training in economics or evolution
if we are to get the most out of our
life here; and if we do not have op
portunity for hearing the best
music, our ideal for that must needs
be low. The first of the monthly
musicals comes tomorrow night.
Our only regret is that the As
sembly Hall cannot be thrown open
so that all who wish might enjoy
the treat.
