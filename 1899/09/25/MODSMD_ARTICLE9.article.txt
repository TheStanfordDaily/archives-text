Those who are interested in the
appearance of our quadrangle can
not hut condemn the practice of
chalking up the arcade with the
announcements of all sorts of lec
tures, games, class and committee
meetings. \\ hen the practice was
begun the excuse was made that
only meetings of special importance
would he so announced, hut at this
time of the year it would he well to
do away with this practice entirely
and to keep the walks of the quad
rangle free from all such methods
of cheap advertising. We would
also suggest that the bulletin hoard
at the main entrance, which is the
official board of the student body,
he kept clear of all notices of
"houses to rent," "books for sale,"
etc., and that it lie used exclusively
as a bulletin board where Univer
sity events alone are to he posted.
The Daily Palo Alto is the of
licial paper of the student body and
notices of all coming events may be
found in the announcement column
of the paper.
