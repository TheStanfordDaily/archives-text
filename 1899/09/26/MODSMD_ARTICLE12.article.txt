With the added powers given the
Athletic Committee by the new con
stitution of the Associated Students
it would seem lit that the members
should realize the importance of
their positions in framing the ath
letic policy of the University at a
crucial period, and at least be pres
ent at the meetings to show a
reasonable interest in the affairs
they are supposed to deal with. At
the first meeting called it was im
possible to enough members to
gether to transact business, and at
the meeting held yesterday there
were hardly enough present for
this purpose, though the business
before the committee was of the ut
most, importance.
