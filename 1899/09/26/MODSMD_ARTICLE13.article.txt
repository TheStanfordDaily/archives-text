A radical change in the manage
ment of our musical clubs has been
proposed by the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students.
It hits heen long felt that the stan
dard of the cluhs would he greatly
raised if the men were chosen ac
cording to Home impartial lest as to
their musical abilities. The mem
he rs of the student body are inter
ested in keeping thestandard of the
clubs high in order that the Univer
sity may he properly represented on
the musical tours. The question
then is whether the chanties pio
posed hy the Executive Committee
will hritig ahoiit this result, or
whether they will so disrupt the
harmony of the cl uhs t hat I hew hole
purpose of the organizations will
be lost.

It is pleasing to see that the en
thusiasm of the bleachers this year
is simultaneous with that of the
gridiron. .Just wherein lay the
fault of last year it would he hard
to determine. The rooters on the
bleachers accused the lack of spirit
to the players, and the players in
turn accused the rooters. Thisyear
neither has fault to find. For a
week crowds have been waiting
for the first line-up, and the men in
suits have been just as eagerly
awaiting the appreciative yell from
the crowds. Neither knew how
eager the other was to begin; but
the beginning, when it did come,
brought back the old time vim of
the men who work and the vocal
possibilities of those who watch.
The revivification was good to see
and promises much for the day to
come.
