It is of interest to note some of
the favorable comments made by
the press concerning the gift of
Mrs. Stanford to the University.
As these were published during the
vacation many of the students may
i not have seen them.
Call.—"Mrs. Stanford's gift to
the University founded in memory
of her son is undoubtedly the most
munificent ;ict of liberality in
America. ... It has no equal
: in any land except that made by
the will of the late Baroness de
llirsch, and in history will be even
more notable than that, for the
llirsch millions are to be scattered
far and wide and will have no
great name anywhere, while those
of Mrs. Stanford will be centered in
an institution destined to become
one of the most renowned seats of
I learning on earth. ... So
| marked will be the change pro-j
| dticed in the affairs of the Univer-i
i sity by the gift that something like
| a new departure in its history will
be dated from this time.
Mrs. Stanford has followed the ex
ampleof her husband and bestowed
her gift during her lifetime instead i
of waiting to leave it by will after
her death. In doing so she has |
j acted not only wisely, but with a!
true liberality of soul. The people
of California owe her much and the!
debt will increase from generation I
to generation."
Jvxnminer.—"The zeal and good
judgment which Mrs. Stanford has
d< /otni to carrying out the plans
for the I niversity give her a fore-!
| most place among the benefactors
I of the State. . . . The State
'has reason to feel pride as well us
atisfaction in the possession, of
such a character as Mrs. Stanford, j
When great wealth is found in such!
hands it is a blessing and not a ;
curse to the community. It is to
be regretted that more of those
whose wealth conies from the op
portunities furnished by the public
have not followed her example."

dowed the University which bears

her son's name with all her worldly
estate. She thus becomes the larg

in the United States. John 1).
Rockefeller has given an aggregate
of about $6,000,000 to the Chicago
University, but this latest gift to
the Stanford University is placed
at $11,000,000. By this act the
entire Stanford estate is returned
to the public. It will perpetuate
the family name more enduringly
than marble monuments. . . . The
Stanford University will become
classic American ground. It will
become evfln more than it is now
one of the historical spots that the
world will want to visit.
