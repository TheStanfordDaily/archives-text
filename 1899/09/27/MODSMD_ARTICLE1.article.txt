# THE 						FIRST MUSICALE.
## A 						Decided Success and a Delightful Forerunner of the Series. 
### 
The musicales which are to be
given the lust Tuesday evening of
each month will be extremely
popular with faculty and students
alike, if the audience which gath
ered last night in the chapel be
any criterion. Long before the
program opened every chair was
tilled, the window seats were taken,
and crowds were standing outside.
The program was short, consist
ing of only five numbers, but ad
mirably arranged so as to bring
out the varied styles of the per
formers. The work of Miss Asher
and Mr. Solomon justified all the
complimentary notices which the
critics have given them. Each
number was perfect in its own
way. In the Arabesque from
Schumann, Miss Asher displayed
that clearness of tone fur which
she is noted, and to a Ballade from
Chopin and a study from Mosz
howski, she brought that brilliancy,
power, and strength that she pos
sesses in so marked a degree. Mr.
Solomon's solo was one of the most
brilliant numbers of the evening,
bringing out as it did the power
and virility of the violinist and
the delicacy and expression of the
accompaniment. The audience
thoroughly appreciated the musi
cal treat which they received, and
expressions of gratification that
musical evenings will come oltenei
than hitherto weie heard on all
sides.
