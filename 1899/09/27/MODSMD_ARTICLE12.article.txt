After we went to press last even
ing a communication was received
from the ladies of the Bed Cross
Society of Balo Alto in regard to
the reception of last Friday. In
the account of the reception which
appeared in Monday's issue men
tion of the work of this society was
not made. The omission was an
oversight on our part and nothing
could have been further from our
intention than to have deprived the
Red Cross Society of credit for the
success of Friday's reception.
