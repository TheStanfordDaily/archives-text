The executive committee of the
Intersociety Debating League has
announced the date of the semi
linals of the Oarnot preliminaries.
Those who wish to en tar the pre
liminary contests should decide at
once and hand their names to the
committee in order that the sched
ule of debaters may be arranged.
It has been a practice with some to
enter when the call is made and
then to drop out just before their
debate comes (iff. This greatly dis
arranges the order of the debutes,
as it leaves the speakers unevenly
divided. The committee requests
that all persons who intend to enter
this year should make tip their
minds fully before they hand in

their names and then, having en
j tered, to remain in the contest until
the end.
