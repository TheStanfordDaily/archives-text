# Berkeley Notes.
## 
### 
—Greisburg is 011 the sick list
and will be unable to assume prac
tice for several weeks.
—The try-out'for the (Jlee Club
takes place this week. The judges
are two musicians who have no
connection with the Associated
Students, Mr. Lorir.g, of San Fran
cisco, and Mr. F. L. Argall, I'. C.,
'96.
—Arrangements are already be
ing made for Thanksgiving even
ing. Besides the regular show,
there will be a general reunion of
alumni and students, and a recep
tion to the football men, these in
the cafe of the Grand Opera House.
—Football is rapidly assuming
its old-time vigor and dash. The
first and second elevens were lined
up for the first time last Saturday.
The first accident of the season oc
curred on Friday when C. R. Par
ker, a Freshman, had his leg
broken as a result of a mixup
tackle.
—At Berkeley on Monday the
freshmen lined up for the first time
against the varsity, and made a
creditable showing. In the matter
of organization U C. freshmen are
a few days ahead of Stanford s
team of Naughty-three. The game
with Oakland High School has
been postponed.
—Although chess, like track ath
letics, has always been California's
strong point, the contest last spring,
which was won by only one game,
would tend to show that her superi
ority for the coining year is any
ithing but assured. Parkhurst and
Jennings, two of Calilornia'sstrong
est players, have left college.

From San Francisco.
