# The 						Students' Guild.

### 
The election of a treasurer of the
Students' Guild, by the Kxeeutive
Committee, to iill the vacancy made
l»y the absence of I* Iv. Gilman,
'01, from the University, suggests
a student organization whose true

worth is not perhaps appreciated
as it should he. The work of the
Guild is in its character unassert
ing and not at all self-advertising.
Those only who in illness are
brought in contact with it seem to
feel what it does each year among
the students who most need assist
ance.
The Guild was organized in the
early years of the University, hav
ing for its main object the assist
ance in illness of students who
need its help, but also ultimately
intending to provide a student hos
pital for the campus. During its
history some five hundred dol
lars have been expended upon
needy students for which no return
has ever been made. Assistance
has not been entirely restricted to
members, though that is the theory
of the institution.
An institution such as this is apt
to bt j somewhat overlooked amid
the student organizations which
are much more prominent in their
work. It certainly has its place in
college life and is worthy of the
support of the students.
