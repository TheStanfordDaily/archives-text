# A 						COMMUNICATION.
## The 						Glee Club Heard From in Regard to the Recent Ruling of the Executive Committee. 
### 
Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
May J be permitted to speak through
your columns of tlie new Glee Club
arrangements. The Executive Com
mittee no doubt is doing its best to
eliminate from the Glee Club cer
tain features which it deems un
wise, but are they taking the right
steps to do so? I think not. The
pendulum has swung too far the
other way and J think the club this
year will show it. Let me take up
some points in the new plan which
has been presented.
It is provided that some musician
of reputation shall bo present at
the try-outs —well and good. But
for what reason do the treasurer
and Executive Committee of the
student body come in? Of course
we can elect the officials with the
Cilee Club in view, but ordinarily
they are chosen on account of some
other qualification than that of
being musicians.
Now it is provided that in order
to protect the Glee Club from "un
desirable 1 ' members, three men
shall be chosen from the club who
shall pass on the new men. Would
any of the Executive Committee
like to serve on such a committee?
Are there any of you who would
like to tell a man that lie is ''unde
sirable" ? Mind you, this com
mittee cannot pass on his voice
along with these other qualifica
ions. They can only say, "Pardon
me; you may nbt know it, but you
would 'queer' Stanford on a trip."
Perhaps there will be found men
who.would like to act on such a
committee, but 1 doubt it.
The Executive Committee shows
its good heart in offering to provide
a director, but we already have a
most excellent one in Mr. Morris,
who offers to come up at rehearsals,
lie understands glee club work es
pecially well, and moreover is on
the ground. It, the Associated Stu
dents employ ;i man from San
Francisco, as I understand they are
thinking of doing, they will find
the bill a large one. The director
is to have authority to make the
final selection. In order to do this
he should be present at least once
each week and oftener during the
last month. You cannot make that
final selection without watching the
men work. Ask any man who has
been through a season with the
club and he will verify that state
ment. A man such as the Execu
tive Committee speaks of will
charge between live and ten dollars
each trip. Unfortunately such men
do not work for their health.
Now there is no doubt that some
new system would be good, but why
make it so radical? The mere fact
t hat every member of the Glee Club
objects is an argument against the
new system. Had the Executive
Committee spoken to some of the
< 1 lee Club officials, they would have
found out the way in which the
club itself started in this year to
remedy its evils The plan was as
fol lows:
1. A try-out was to be held, after
which the men making the poorest
showing were to be dropped.
About forty men came to that try

out, and soon twenty were re
served.
'2. A second try-out was to be
held including all the old mem
bers of the club. In this seven
men to a part were to be retained—
three more than the necessary num
ber—making almost a double club
to start with.
3. Then the final selection, just
before the trip, was to be placed in
the hands of some one who would
act in conjunction with the Glee
Club committee. Mr. Morris had
kindly volunteered to direct the
club and if we could have had him
he would have been given power to
make the final pick of men. It is
in this final selection that trouble
always comes.
Is not this last a more practical
working basis than the one now
proposed? Or at least is not a
combination of the two better? It
seems that some system could be
arranged under which the club
would work in harmony with the
Executive Committee.
I wish to add a few words about
the club of the past. 1 shall as
sume that it. has not been what it
should have been. The objection
is made that there are too .few
"non-frat" men in it. I grant
that, but what is the reason?
There have been about four fratei
nity men to every other one at the
♦ry-outs, and about the same num
ber on the club. The reason non
fraternity men have not come out
is not because they are afraid to.
That may operate with some, but
the reason is, they are not urged
to. In a fraternity the older men
insist on the younger men trying
for such honors. No matter how
you work your try-outs, there will
always lie a greater number of
fraternity men in the clubs.
The term "desirable" was used
in the resolution from the hixecu
tive Committee. What is a de
sirable man? He has a voice to
begin with, but there are other qual
ifications also. He must he some
thing of a gentleman, because one
of the best features of a trip is
the impression left, not only at the
concert, but after it, among the
people who come in cantact with i
our men. In Sacramento we were
taken to the homes of the people
instead of to the hotels. If you
send a fellow, who is in any way
below the standard expected of a
college man, you leave a bad im
print, even though the man may
have an excellent voice. A man
that drinks heavily brings discred
it upon the University and should
be left out. In short, the men
should represent a gentlemanly
type. These hist remarks may
not be exactly in line with what I
started to say, but they illustrate
how hard it will be for a stranger
to come in and pick a Glee man
from hearing him sing once. A
committee of the C J lee Club should
act with him.
In the past the glee clubs have
been one of the big drawing cards
for Stanford. Perhups no one thing,
unless it be football, has so well ad
vertised us in the south. Let us
keep up the standard by having
the Glee Club pull with the execu
tive instead of against it. We can
do it, and the results will be good.
