Someonb has put tacks on the
pedestrian's path to I alo Alto.

Aside from the results to people
with well-worn shoe soles, there is
not much need for a warning that
this drastic measure has been re
sorted to. That such a retaliation
on the part of pedestrians is as un
called for as it is underhanded, can
hardly be doubted when one
considers that those cyclists who
used the path through ignorance
of the rule and a failure to see the
rather inconspicuous signs, or even
through carelessness, would have
ceased to ride on the cinders if they
had been informed in every case
by the pedestrians they passed.
This much can be said: that in
former years when the rain ren
dered the pedestrian's side unfit for
passage, the walkers had no hesita
tion in crossing over to the cyclers'
path and cutting it up considera
bly. Also, the pedestrians' side was
put in its present good condition
by the University authorities and
without cost to the wheel-less,
while the cyclers paid at the rate
of fifty cents a head for the privi
lege of not bothering pedestrians.
What makes the tack episode the
more reprehensible is the fact that
some of the tacks are at road inter
sections, where the cyclist has no
choice but to cross the cinders.
