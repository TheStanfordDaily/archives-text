# The 						Art Department.

### 
About the beginning of the sec
ond semester last year the Barron
studios were first given over to the
use of the Art department, and their
usefulness and high value began to
be seen at once. This year, how
ever, with the addition of l'rofessor
Clark, who has returned from a
year's study abroad, to the faculty
of the department, and the value of
the work done last year as an in
centive, bids fair to establish the
department of drawing and paint
ing as one of the strong brandies
of the University curriculum, where
as it had been lamentably weak be
fore, due to the lack of facilities
and close, cramped quarters in the
attic of the civil engineering build
ing.
During the past summer an ex
hibition of the work done in the de
partment was a part of the attrac
tion at the National Educational
Association Convention held at Los
Angeles, and competent critics say
that Stanford's collection showed
to a wonderful degree the mastery
of the fundamental principles of
free-hand drawing.
The work given in the depart
ment is, to quote one of the instruc
tors, for the purpose of "clear
drawing," and no attempt is made
t<> follow any "school" of any kind
or to tench anything beyond the
pupil's individual ability to see and
appreciate form and color, and to
put them (lowi. ;is he sees them.
