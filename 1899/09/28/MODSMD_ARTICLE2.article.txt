# FOOTBALL PRACTICE
## The 						Men Gradually Rounding Into Shape and Receiving Training on Fundamental Points. 
### 
Last night's practice consisted
merely in running down on punts
and tackling. Jack Reynolds was
out in his uniform, and did some
excellent work in punting, as did
also Eryx. '03. The best work in
running with the ball was done by
Murphy and G. Parker. Both are
getting into shape rapidly, and
show their old-time form and speed.
The freshmen were taken off by
themselves, and after a short signal
practice the elevens were lined up
against each other for a scrimmage.
P. Parker played an excellent game
at half, running strong with the
bal I and showing good speed. Raitt
played a head}' game at quarter.
Never before have so many fresh
men appeared for practice, and if
the prevailing spirit is continued,
this year's freshman team will be
hard to beat.
Following are the men who
played in the first freshmen elev
en : Suttinger, r. e.; Crowfoot, r. t.;
Graves, r. g.; Lee, center; Treager,
1. g.; Lowenthal, 1. t.; Crawford,
1. e.; Raitt, quarter; Greer, r. h.;
P. Parker, 1. h.; Campbell, full.
The freshmen will begin practice
hereafter at 4 p.m. Coach Cham
berlin will be out at that time, and
give the men his special attention.
Charlie Raitt has been appointed
temporary captain, and will have
charge of the team in Saturday's
game.
