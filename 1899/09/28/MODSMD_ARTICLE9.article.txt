sibility, in view of the fact that Ber
keley has her old players, a good
coach, and a renewal of last year's

For the first time in all the history
of Stanford, glorious as it has been,
the equipment is any place near
satisfactory. This year we have a
coach, a trainer, and a rubber; all
of them working in harmony and

elevens that ought to heat Berke
ley, and as far as the freshman
game is concerned, everything
looks propitious for the Cardinal's
first victory. Of course we realize
too that it is a little early in the
season to begin predictions and
prognostications, but when the en
thusiasts can see freshman first
and freshman second elevens play
ing with the dash and grit shown
last night, and can realize too that
there are enough more freshmen on
the field to make up still another
pair of teams, there is certainly
cause for congratulation.
