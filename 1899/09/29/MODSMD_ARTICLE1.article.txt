# GLEE CLUB AGAIN.
## The 						Whole Matter Gone Over at a Meeting of the Executive Committee Last Night. 
### 
Mr. F B. Braden appeared be
fore the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students last night
in regard to that committee's ac
tion as to the sanction of the Glee
Club. He presented the communi
cation which he published in last
night's issue of the Daily Palo
Alto, and the matters brought up
were thoroughly discussed by Mr
Braden and the various members
of the committee. Owing to a
misunderstanding of the terms of
the announcement promulgated at
the last meeting and published in
this paper, it was read by the sec
retary. We print it in full again
tonight in order that the student
body may have the exact facts of
both sides in the present contro
versy.
"The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students hereby an
nounces that the official sanction
of the Glee Club can be had only
011 condition that the personnel of
the club be made up in the follow
ing manner: The treasurer of the
Associated Students, in conjunc
tion with the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students, shall
select some musician of reputation
to act as judge at the try-outs,â€”
the try-outs being conducted sole
ly under the auspices of the Exec
utive Committee and treasurer of
the Associated Students. The
names of the candidates chosen by
the judge shall be given in a sealed
envelope to the president of the As
sociated Students and the officers
of the Glee Club. Candidatesshall
be ranked at the try-outs and ail
vacancies filled by selecting the
one standing highest on the list at
the time such vacancy occurs. All
subsequent try-outs shall be held
in a similar manner. The leader
and manager of the Glee Club
shall be exempt from the above
mentioned test. But it is provided
that all other places must be made
by competition. I n order to pro
tect the Glee Club from undesirable
members, it Is further provided
that from the members chosen as
specified to compose the Glee Club,
there shall be elected an executive
committee of three members who
shall pass upon the successful can
didates. Each member chosen by
the musical judge shall be eligible
to vote for the three committeemen.
" The Executive Committee of
the Associated Students further
announces it* willingness to pro
vide a reasonable sum for securing
a director for the Glee Club who
shall also make the final selection
of men.
"It is further announced that
the foregoing action reflects in no
way upon the manner in which the
Glee Club has been conducted this
year.'
In the first place Mr Braden
misinterpreted the words, "under
the auspices of the treasurer and
the executive Committee of the
Associated Students," and contend
ed that it would be better to have
the old Glee Club men instead of
the Executive Committee to "con
duct" the first try-out. The mem
bers of the committee set Mr.

Braden right 011 this point, that
the judge of the try-out and no
other person, either from the Glee
(Jluh or Executive Committee,
"conducted" the first try-out, and
eolely on the question of a man's
musical ability.
The second contention was that
no one would wish to pass on the
question of a man's general "de
sirability," or to inform him that
lie was "undesirable." This ac
tion has always been taken by the
Olee Club Committee in the past,
and the present announcement
changes nothing save that every
man who passes the voice test has
a vote for the members of the com
mittee, making the eliminating
body a more democratic one and
one that is not open to the preju
dices of the former year.
The matter of expense of a musi
cal leader the Executive Commit
tee has already provided for, and
in spite of Mr. Braden's doubts as
to the student body's willingness to
meet the cos', the Executive Com
mittee practically pledged the ex
pense based on Mr. Braden's own
estimate.
The Executive Committee had
looked this matter up thoroughly
before making its final announce
ment, and found that "every mem
ber of the Glee Club" did not ob
ject to the new system. In fact,
they found several who gave it
their unqualified approval.
The question of fraternity and
non-fraternity members oi the
club, brought up by Mr. Braden,
was not discussed in any way, as
being entirely extraneous to the
matter in hand. And it was fur
ther contended that, with the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Glee Club
and of the Associated Students cog
nizant of the men who were to rep
resent Stanford abroad, it would
not be necessary in the future, as
in the two years past, to have the
faculty blue pencil eliminate "un
desirable" men.
Ir. conclusion the committee
thanked Mr. Braden for appearing
and presenting his side of the ques
tion, but deemed it unnecessary and
unwise to depart from their first
announcement, which was ratified
as first promulgated.
Arrangements have been made
by which the musician selected by
the Executive Committee will be
here to make the voice try-out as
soon as possible, probably next
Tuesday.
The treasurer was empowered to
make all arrangements for a judge
and a permanent lender, lie re
ported on the proposition of a thea
ter for Thanksgiving night, and in
view of his report, was directed to
fix on a theater for the evening of
the game. The place practically
decided on was the Tivoli, where
'' The Idol's Kye" will be presented
with local hits and student special
ties.
Manager Wilson appeared for
the band, and was allowed an ap
propriation for hiring a profession
al leader from the city, who will
put the band on a good basis and
give it careful training and instruc
tion. Mr. Knell, of San Fran
cisco, has been engaged for the
season, and will give one lesson a
week during the first month, and

will be down twice a week during
the second month, lie is a well
known leader and has for some
years been conducting the very
successful League of the Cross Ca
det Band.
The matter of the debt of the
Daily Palo Alto for last semester
was discussed, but no action was
taken pending the final report of
the committee having the investi
gation in charge. This report will
be presented at the next meeting
which will be held next Wednes
day evening, October 4th. Previ
ous to this the meetings have been
held on Thursdays, but it was
found that the date did not suit all
the members.
