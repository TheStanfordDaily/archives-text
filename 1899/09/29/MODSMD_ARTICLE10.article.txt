The whole purpose of the an
nouncement made in Tuesday's
Daily I'alo Alto, as explained by
the members of the Executive Com
mittee, is to pick out in the lirst
place, without any question of fa
voritism, the best singers who ap
pear at the try-outs; in the second
place, to have the Glee Club protect
itself, within itself, from undesir
able members. This seems to em
body the main points contended for
by Mr. Uraden in his communica
tion published in these columns
yesterday. The Executive Com
mittee has evidently given this
question careful consideration, and
judging by the way it has taken
in hand and decided the questions
that have come up before it —the
volunteer reception, the band, foot
ball grounds, songs, trainer, etc. —
it would seem that it can be de
pended on to carry matters to a
just conclusion. It is to be hoped
that any man who has ever thought
of trying for the club will appear
at the first try-out under the new
system in order that the plan may
be thoroughly tested and given a
fair trial.
