# GAME POSTPONED.
## Faculty of St. Matthew's Calls Tomorrow's Game Off Indefinitely. 
### 
On account of injuries sustained
in practice and in their Berkeley
game, the St. Matthew's School
boys will not be able to play the
Stanford Freshmen tomorrow. At
a late hour this evening the faculty
of St. Matthew's notified Manager
Wardall that the game for Satur
day would have to be postponed.
There has not been sufficient time
to arrange for another game.
