# The 						Far East.
## 
### 
The lecture Friday afternoon by
John W. Barrett, the United States
minister to Siarn, was one of partic
ular interest. The lecturer first told
of his travels and experiences in
Siam, aud then pointed out the pos
sibilities of development in the trade
of the far East.
He was appointed five years ago,
being then the youngest American
minister, and has spent much time
in study and personal observation
of the Eastern nations. His diplo
matic travels have taken him not
only through all parts of Siam, but
into Japan and China and the isl
ands of the Pacific.
"We are looking out upon the Pa
cific," he said "just as Boston
and New York and Baltimore and
the cities of the coast have looked
out upon tiie Atlantic; we little
realize the possibilities before us;
and 1 am one of those who believe
that here on the Pacific Coast we
are to develop the highest type of
the American.
" It is a most unfortunate error in
America, to consider the people of
Asia as barbarians 1 believe that
the only way one can have a
true knowledge of the Orient is by
personal observation, and I wish to
say that the people of China and
of Siam and of the Philippines are
by no means savages. 1 do not mean
to say that their government is at
all the equal of ours, or that their
men or their women can be at all
compared to American men and
women; but taking them in the ab
stract, there is much of good in them
There is a plus side as well as a
minus side.
"There are club houses in the
great cities of Asia which would be a
credit to New York or Chicago,there
is as much shipping in the treaty
ports of China as on our Atlantic
seaboard, and far more than we
see in San Francisco or in Port
land."
Of Siam, Mr. Barrett said that
it was today making more progress
than any other country of Asia It's
king he considered the foremost
Asiatic statesman.
I n all his travels Mr. Harrett never
carried a weapon; he believed that
none who treated the Orientals prop
erly would have trouble with them
In China, whose immense popula
tion and vast territory have not
four hundred miles of railroad,
Mr Barrett pointed out one of the
greatest fields for American enter
prise.
"It we do not build railroads in
China, the powers of Europe will,
and my conclusion from personal
observation is that none of those
powers care particularly for the
United States. I believe that it is
our duty to develop the trade of
China, and presuve the nation
from dissolution."
Mr. Barrett's remarks on the
Philippines were particularly inter
esting; he had made his travels
and reached bis conclusions long
before he had any idea that they
could come under American rule
Mr Barrett knows of an American
who has traveled more extensively
iu Luzon than himself.
Of that island he said," I have
never seen in any part of the world
a more resourceful country, and
every foreigner who has ever trav

eled through it confirms my opin
ion. . . . Not for one second
would I advocate anything which I
thought injurious to our national
welfare, or to our national integrity;
but I will say that 1 believe it the
! will of a Supreme Being, that we
| should hold the Philippines."
Mr. Barrett was present at many
of the conferences with the Filipino
'chiefs, and believes that every ef
fort was made by our Government
to avoid the present conflict. "Our
whole history in the Orient has
been one of honor," he said. " I
believe that we are now reaching
the fortunate conclusion of the war.
and that next summer will see the
establishment of peace and order
and good government in the isl
ands."
Mr. Barrett closed with a few re
marks about the nation's hero,
Dewey, which were of great value
as the impressions of a man who
i has been a personal friend and as
sociate of the Admiral.
