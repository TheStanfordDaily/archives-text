The committee having in charge
the entries for the Carnot semi
finals informs us that only three
students have thus far signified
their intention of entering the eon
test. We know that a large num
ber expect to try f*»r the Carnot de
hate this year, and considering the
fact that the list closes on Thurs
day, we would suggest that they
hand in their names at once. There
has always heen delay through the
carelessness of students in thismaL
ter and it would he a good plan if
we could get our debating interests
started promptly and smoothly this
year.
Always in ease of defeat there
comes to us the wail of some dis
appointed one endeavoring to show
the cause of such defeat. In last
week's Sequoia an article appears
criticising the athletic manage
ment of last year in no uncertain
terms. We are prepared to concede
that last year's system was not
what it should have heen or what
it has heen in the past, hut when
the writer, who by the way was not
on the field at any time during the
year, states that''there was a fla
grant disregard of training rules
by some members of the team and
football squad," his criticism loses
whatever value it would otherwise
have had. We feel competent to
say in behalf of the football squad
of last year that training rules were
observed throughout the year as
regularly as it was possible for j
men to observe them. The men j
were in bad condition not because j
of their failure to follow training
rules but on account of the mi- !
healthy condition of climate, bad
water, poor training-table facilities,
the causes for which they were in I
no way to blame. The writer goes!
on to say: '"One would suppose
that at least during the final week ■

at Congress Springs, the strictest
attention would be paid to them,
but it was not so." Where the
writer obtained his information for
this statement we are at a loss to
know. As a member of the foot
ball squad of last season we can
speak as one who knows the facts
of the case and are prepared to say
that if training rules were broken
at any time during the week's stay
at Congress Springs it was because
the men did not know what these
rules were. It is enough that the
men were beaten in the Thanksgiv
ing game; they made a hard fight
and worked throughout the season
against the heaviest odds. It may
be that some of them were working
only for their u S," but this is a
serious charge against the loyalty
of Stanford men and it would have
been better left unsaid. The value
of good criticism and wholesome
advice to our athletes cannot lie
gainsaid, but when the facts of the
case are so grossly overlooked as in
this incident, such criticism works
an injury instead of a benefit.
