### 
The committee of three from the
Freshman Class met in room 10
this afternoon to discuss plans for
the Freshman-Sophomore debate
and the try-out. Half a dozen fresh
men were present. In all, fifteen
names have been handed in for the
preliminaries. The list is still open
and the committee will meet at the
same place at 1:30 tomorrow. The
candidates will debate in squads of
four, each squad to choose its own
subject.
