In the Engineering Magazine for
October, Hon. John Barrett makes
a strong argument, for the alliance
of England, America, and Germany
in the maintenance of the policy of
the "open door" in China. Speak
ing from intimate knowledge, lie
describes industrial possibilities in
the development of China and in
the provisions for her rising needs,
which are well worth a struggle.
But his point is that, with an
Anglo - American - Teutonic stand
for the maintenance of the integ
rity of the Empire and the observ
ance of the Tien-Tsin treaties, no
struggle will be necessary.
The feature of this number of the
magazine, however, is the strong
preach men t of the gospel of stand
ardisin and specialization in me
chanical work. Sir Benjamin
Browne, Mr. .1. Slater Lewis, and
Henry Roland—each a leading au
thority discuss, each from his own
standpoint, the reorganization of
manufacturing and mechanical in
dustries which is demanded by the
international spread and increasing
keenness ot competition. Sir Ben
jamin considers engineering con

struction; Mr. Slater Lewis, works
organization; Mr. Roland, machine
tool equipment, and his piiper is
most strikingly illustrated by en
gravings of historic tools. Dr.
Loins Hell, in another finely illus
trated article, considers the closely
allied theme of electric power in
engineering works, llerr Maack
continues his exposition of German
ship-building, with magnificent en
gravings of characteristic works
and their products. Lieut. Robinson
has an excellent pictorial paper on
naval auxiliary machinery, and
Mr. Archer Brown a most instruc
tive summary of the outlook for
American iron production. •
