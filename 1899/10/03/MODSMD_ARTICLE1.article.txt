# LAST NIGHT'S PRACTICE.
## Four Elevens Line Up in a Spirited Practice. 
### 
Last u'ght's practice was by far
the most spirited of the year.
Enough men were out to form four
teams, with a large reserve on the
side-lines,anxious for a trial. About
seventy men indulged in the usual
preliminary practice of falling on
the ball and catching punts.
After a short signal practice, the
first and second elevens were lined
up. Under the enthusiastic coach
ing of hewers, the second eleven
made a gritty stand, but after ten
minute's fierce play the ball was
carried over for a touch-down by
M cFadden.
The line bucking of Faris was
good. Leavitt at end is showing
his old time form in tackling.
McFadden was quick in getting
down the field under punts and sel
dom failed to get bis man.
Two of the reserve elevens then
faced each other. Their play,
while just as spirited as that of the
former teams, lacked form and
much fumbling was in evidence.
A touch-down was made after a few
minutes' play. The good work of
P. Parker and P. E. Nourse was
noticeable, both making long runs.
Chamberlin called out the first
and second elevens to resume play.
The ball was secured by the first
eleven on the kick-off, and was
rushed over the line a minute later
by McFadden.
During the rest of the practice
the. ball was kept in the middle of
the field. The work of McGilivray
was good, especially in breaking
through and blocking punts.
It is too early in the season to
criticise too closely the work of the
men. From the spirit displayed,
all seem to realize that their hest
efforts are necessary in forming a
winning team.
SLeuart Cotton, '98, Varsity cap
tain, "Jack" Reynolds, '96, and
hewers, assisted Chamber.in
