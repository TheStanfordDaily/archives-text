It is with pleasure that we ac
knowledge the gift of Mr. James
D. Phelan to the University Li
brary. In some branches our
library facilities are very weak at
this time and scarcely anything
could be more welcome to us than
a gift of valuable books such as
Mr. Phelan has presented. The
students appreciate any interest
shown in our University affairs by
those outside of the University and
take this occasion of publicly
thanking Mr. Phelan for his gift.
