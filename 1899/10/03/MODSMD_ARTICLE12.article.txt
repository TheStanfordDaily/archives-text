In these days of degeneracy in
college spirit into which some of
our old heroes have feared we were
falling, there is an especial pleasure
in the glimmering lights of Encina.
They have told us for several years
how the old times used to he with
three hundred men in Encina.
Berkeley, we know, has attributed
much of our success in past years
to the lessons of enthusiasm taught
in the college dormitory, and we
ourselves have not doubled hut that
the decline in number of the oc
cupants of Encina contributed not
a little to our defeat of last year.
Stanfordites have always taken
more than a mere pride in the Hall
for they have thus felt its close re
lation to college lift and athletic
success. Rallies in its club room
have the next day resulted in vic
tory, and speeches from its tables
have replaced discouragement with
confidence. The loyal student
loves Encina no less for its associa
tions than for itself.
It may be somewhat early to
point to results, but there is no
doubt a general feeling of confi
dence that the activity in Encina,
whose fourth floor is occupied for
the first time in several years, will
bring results to athletics and col
lege spirit which cannot help but
be beneficial. A snap and energy

on the football field and several
extra elevens of freshmen may be ,
but the first manifestation of a de
termination to do or die which En
cina rallies are best fitted to keep
alive.
