Berkeley's game tv'th theOlym
i pic Club team last Saturday, while
;it is yet a little early in the season
to draw definite conculsions, would
! seem to prove that our rivals have
i already an aggressive policy, and a
; determination that means a great
deal in the way of bringing victory
to the banner of the Blue and Gold.
I They went against a team superior
in weight, and one they had reason
jto suppose, from their long train
ing, their superior in concerted team
work, but they "forced the lighting"
through both halves and never let
their goal get into danger. It is
true that their playing lacked the
dash and brilliancy that we might
have expected from what is prac
tically the same team that defeated
us last year, and it is also true that
their stars did not shine above the
others. In fact the best playing
r.n the field was that of "Tommy"
Code, who never fails to wear his
cardinal jersey when playing
against Berkeley. But there seems
gaound for apprehension in the
very fact that the U. C. "cracker
jacks" were not in evidence, that
Cochran is making a team, not an
aggregation of line players. In
other words, Berkeley is done with
its dependence on Halle and lian
somes And we at Stanford must
I keep that fact in mind.
