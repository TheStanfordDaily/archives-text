### 
The intercollegate committee on
football rules, composed of mem
bers from Yale, Harvard, Johns
Hopkins, Cornell, Princeton, and
Pennsylvania,, held a meeting
recently with the idea of making
clear several points in the new
code of rules drawn up last year.
Itule K, that relating to the heel
ing down of a ' fair ratch," has
been changed to read as follows:
"A fair catch consists in catching
the hall after it has been picked
up by one of the opponents, and
before it touches the ground, or in
similarly catching a punt-c lit

by another of the catcher's own
side. Provided the player while
making (he catch makes a mark
with his heel and takes not more
than one step thereafter. It is not
fair if the ball, after the kick, was
touched by another of his side be
fore the catch. Opponents who
are off-side shall not interfere in
any way with a player attempt
ing to make a fair catch, nor
should he be thrown to the ground
after such catch has been made un
less he advance beyond his mark
as explained."
in rule 11, referring to the ball
when "dead," it reads as changed:
"Should the ball strike an official,
it is not regarded as dead, but play
continues exactly as if the ball had
not touched him." Rule 28, deal
ing with penalties for fouls and off
side plays, has been changed to
read, "In case of a free kick (Rule
2, 112) if the kicker advances beyond
his mark before chasing the ball
(Rules 7, and 15, b), for whether
be then kicks or not, the opponents
shall be allowed to line-up five
yards nearer the kicker's mark,
and the kick shall then be made
from the same point back of the
tirsl mark, and at the same dis
tance from the side-lines. This
shall also apply when the side
having a free kick allows the ball
to touch the ground and then fails
to kick it, kick off and try-at-goal
after touch-down excepted. The
same ruling shall also be given in
case any player o. e the side making
a free kick is ahead of the ball
when it is kicked." Section F of
the same rule, which restricts
starting before the ball is put in
play for a scrimmage, provided
there is no infraction of Rule 10.
the ball shall be brought back and
put in play again. If this occurs
again in the same down the ball
shall be given to the opponents.
If again during the game that side
infiinges the rule bearing on this
act, the ball shall be immediately
given to the opponents."
