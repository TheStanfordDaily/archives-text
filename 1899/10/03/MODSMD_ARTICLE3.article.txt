# Summer Vacations.

During .June Fetter went
with several members of his class
in Social Problems to San Francis
co for field work. Their researches
covered a part of the interesting
district south of Market. The dis
trict was divided, and each worker
undertook to study carefully the
social agencies of all kinds at work
there. The collected data then
furnished material for a sociologi
cal map which will serve as a basis
for comparison with other areas.
Dr. Fetter, when questioned, said
that the main importance of such
work lies in its pedagogic value.
As direct observation is considered
necessary now to supplement class
room study iu the natural sciences,
so will it come to be considered
more and more necessary in socio
logical work.
Professor Newcomer spent June
in Illinois and .Inly in Montana
and the Yellowstone Park.
Dr. Wood found his tour of the
leading universities of the East
and Middle West full of interest
from first to last. Speaking of
facilities for training, he said that
in many places gymnasium and
athletic facilities are combined in

the same building. Some universi
ties have separate training houses,
as Yale, while one, Princeton, has
a general athletic building con
taining a training table and sleep
ing quarters. Throughout the
East the tendency in training meth
ods seems to be to allow more .play
of individuality in the diet and
regimen. The trend of athletics
at Harvard, at least, is toward an
increased participation in general
athletics, with the premium put
upon individual development. Dr.
Wood spent the month of July in
Boston and New York, doing
special work in medical and hy
gienic diagnosis.
Professor Bran tier is expected to
return about the middle of October
from an expedition to Brazil of
which Professor Agassizof Harvard
made him the head. The party,
consisting of Dr. Branner, A. W.
Greeley, '98, and several under
graduates started from here in
May. Their purpose was to study
the formation of certain coral and
sandstone reefs off the coast of
Brazil.
Professors Wing, Marx, and
Hoskins spent the first half of the
vacation in making iiydraulic ex
periments at Ogden in continuation
of work begun there two years ago.
Professor and Mrs. Miller went
in May to Minneapolis, the former
as lay delegate from the Presbytery
of San Jose to the General Assem
bly there. From that time until
August Ist he studied at Ann Ar
bor.
Professors Starbuck, Duniway,
Johnston, and Cox, and R. \V.
Husband, A. M., '96, gave summer
courses at the Grove, while many
others of the faculty spent all or
