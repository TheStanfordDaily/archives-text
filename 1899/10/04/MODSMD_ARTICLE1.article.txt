# NEW PUBLICATIONS.
## The
						Second Issue of the "Stanford Alumnus‚Äù and the First of the "Chaparral" About to Appear. 
### 
In a few clays the second issue of
the Stanford Alumnus, the oHicial
organ of the Alumni Association,
will he ready for publication from
the University press. As its title
signifies, it is meant mainly for
graduates and former students, but
there are many things in its col
umns which will be of interest to
the undergraduates. The Alumnus
is a monthly, and will hereafter
appear regularly at the beginning
of each month. It was rather un
fortunate that three months inter
vened between its lirst and second
issues, the first having come out
last June. The news of July,
August and September are given in
this, the second number, with spe
cial articles of interest, and descrip
tions of the new buildings and
those now in course of construction.
It keeps its attractive cardinal
cover. Charles Ernest Schwartz,
'99, is alumni editor and Helen
Swett, '00, is in charge of under
graduate news.
The Chaparral makes its initial
appearance tomorrow and should
be fully up to expectations. Typo
graphically it is as near perfect as
such a publication can be, and is
the work of the Stanley-Taylor
Presg of San Francisco, the firm
which did such excellent work on
last year's Sequoia, and more es
pecially the 1900 Quad. Most of
the issue is the work of Larry How
man, '01, and Hristow Adams, '00,
whose names appear at the head of
the editorial page, though there is
h center page cartoon by Culver,
'99, and some of the reading matter
is bv E. W. Smith, '99, editor of
last semester's Palo Alto. The
cover design, a joint production of
Howman and Adams, is original
and striking, being printed in two
colors, cardinal and black. Copies
will be on sale on the quad tomor
row, at the Hookstore, and in Palo
Alto.
