The drauiatic entertainment by
Mr. John E. Kellerd to be given in
the chapel Friday afternoon prom
ises to be entirely distinct from the
ordinary performance. The oppor
tunity of hearing Mr. Kellerd, who
is one of the leading artists on the
stage today, should be taken ad
vantage of by everybody. Mr.
Kellerd's engagement in the city
compels him to appear in the after
noon, but the entertainment will
be none the less interesting on that
account. A rare treat is in store
for those who attend.
