We note with regret the lack of
activity so far shown this semester
by the Outing Club. The Univer
sity has always taken especiAl pride
in the beauty of its surrounding
country. The many adjacent trips
have made Geology, Engineering,
and other clulis a. source of pleas
ure as well as instruction, and
small excursions to the mountains
give one of the principal sources of
relaxation among our students.
The Outing Club was instituted to
methodize these trips and keep
alive among the students an active
interest in their surroundings. As
such it has a legitimate place
among our organizations. There
is no better time for its revival than
during the pleasant weather of the
fall.
