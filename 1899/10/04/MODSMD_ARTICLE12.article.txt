Now that a section of the bleach
ers has been roped off as a yelling
section, where none but those who
expect to yell are to be in evidence,
we find it necessary to reiterate our
criticism of the yell as given at
present. There is no cadence, no
vim, no snap—a mere slurring of
the whole tiling Perhaps those
who are yelling do not realize it;
but if they want an object lesson
let anyone hear a phonograph cyl
inder taken last year by one of

the members of the present Junior
Clays. The yell was the same then
as it is now, and was given in the
same "sloppy" way. The phono
graph cannot reproduce the volume
but it serves up the lack of articula
tion in a startling manner —the
sorriest caricature of a cadeuced,
rythmic yell that was ever uttered.
Our rooters and yell leaders want
to ''get on to" this. And while
speaking of yelling, isn't the roped
off yelling section a bad proposi
tion on the very face of it. It makes
the distinction that certain of the
men are supposed to yell. How
about the rest? Should there he
any divisions into "vellers" and
u non-yellers"?
