# Encina Hall.
## 
### 
President Jordan, in his address
to the Alumni at their banquet last
year, spoke of Encina ITall, and
called attention to the fact that
every dollar coming from the men
who room in the hall is returned

to them by the University in better
facilities and more books for the li
brary.
The hall, which went up with the
quad, is one of the University
buildings. It is a four-story sand
stone building, in the shape of the
letter " E," and ranks among the
finest college dormitories in the
world.
The spirit born in the hall is the
Stanford spirit, and the association
with other men of the college is in
itself an education. All noise in
the hall ceases at 8 p.m., that the
most studious man may find ample
time for study.
In February, 1898, Encina Club
was organized, and the dining-room
secured as a club-room, through the
kindness of Mrs. Stanford. The
walls have been lined with trophies
and pictures of former athletic
teams ; tables have been scattered
around, on which are copies of cur
rent magazines, and where may be
found the exchanges of the Sequoia
and Daily Palo Alto, while in the
south end of the hall are billiard
and pool tables. The club-room
is the rendezvous for the men of
the University whenever they gather
together; there are held the athletic
rallies every semester. The dues of
the club are one dollar per semes
ter. Every man in Encina is a
member of the club.
The club is self-governing. The
Executive Committee for the pres
ent year is made up of the follow
ing men: 0. T. Hayden, '00; G, P.
Roberts, '00; Charles Cantwell, '01;
K. F. Cooper, '02 ; C. A. Whit
more, '02, and Frank Hoit, '03.
The Executive Committee elects
the other officers from its own mem
bers. The officers for the ensuing
year are: President, C. T. Hayden,
'00; vice-president, (J. P. Roberts,
'00; secretary, K. F. Cooper, '02;
treasurer, C. A. Whitmore, '02.
The president appoints each mem
ber of the Executive Committee to
the chairmanship of one of the
seven committees. Each chairman
then selects the members of his
committee from among the men in
the hall. President Hayden has
filled the following chairmanships:
Chairman of the committee on
ways and means, President Hay
den, '1)0; finance, Whitmore, '02;
trophies, Cantwell, '01; literature,
Leiter, '99; decorations, Cooper,'o2;
reception, Roberts, '00; games,
Hart, '03. The personnel of each
committee will be announced when
it has been decided upon.
