# LAST NIGHT'S LECTURE.
## Dr. Jordan Gives His Annual Advice to the Men and Women of the New Class. 
### 
Last evening Dr. Jordan gave
his annual talk to the new stu
dents. As usual whenever Dr. Jor
dan lectures, the chapel was tilled
to the doors, and standing room
was at a premium. He said in part:
One peculiarity which in-coming
classes notice is the absence of
rules. There is no reward by
which the faculty picks you out
from your fellows, no one to pat
you on the back or '•cuss'' you. A
certain class of students are taken
to the edge of the campus and
dropped off. Rewards, punish
ments, and marks, we do not find
profitable. The reward you will
lind in the excellence of your work.
An educated man is the strong
man. The educated man of the
community is the mau who has
power in the community. The ed
ucated man is the one who knows
things. You can here learn to
handle yourself and others to the
best advantage. No body of stu
dents on earth contains more
strong character, more manly
young men or handsomer young
women. Associate with the best
young men and women. I actu
ally believe that there is no other
body of professors equal to ours.
A student should know his pro
fessors, and should become inti
mately and closely .acquainted
with them, Bismarck said that in j
the University of Germany one
third go to the grave through dis
sipation, one-third from over-study,
and the rest rule Europe.
A certain clqss of young men see
that the doors of the University
and of several other places are
wide open, and they use these
privileges unwisely.
It is not manly to be either
rough or tough. Another class
work themselves to death. We
have certain students who attempt
to do a great deal of work on noth
ing to eat. I remember a young
man who wore one coat as long as
1 knew him, and be never brushed
it. No one is so poor as not to be
able to wear a clean face. It
doesn't pay to look like a grave
digger, even if you are going into
that occupation.
To young men the University is
the place for manly life. An edu
cation is only valuable when
backed up by good character. You
teach character by example, Had
morals stand in your way. One
thing I have looked at with a good
deal of doubt, almost dread, is the
habit of ''swiping" spoons bearing
names of steamship and railroad
companies. It is no good joke
when the person, who is the
victim, does not like it. Stealing
books from the library is not a
joke,but stealing. It isn't the ques
tion whether the faculty knows it —
that doesn't matter. The man
who swipes here is likely to embez
zle or cheat his clients if he be a
lawyer. A college training in
swiping is apt to be good training
for a career as a dishonest politician,
the bane of this country. A still
more vicious tendency is called
hazing. I do not think that any
large body of students is so free

from hazing us this. Hazing has
a pernicious effect on the reputa
tion of an institution. This is also
a good reason why rushing should
he avoided. Possible accidents do
more harm than years of football,
or other athletic sports.
Gambling occasionally attacks
this institution in a slight degree.
It is an exceedingly poor kind of
jollity that needs alcohol to stir it
up.
The man who drags others down,
however, is of no account. The Uni
versity claims the right to ask any
young man or woman to withdraw
from the University, with or with
out reason. A certain per cent, of
the Freshman Class will be flunked
out, but if they are good thev may
come back the following semester.
We want our athletes to be such
men as we can be proud of. We
might bring in a class of hired ath
letes who would win all the games
but whose influence would be very
bad for the institution. We are
not ashamed of our football men;
we are proud or them, We have
more to expect from our football
men in the way of morals than
from our insignificant ones.
It has been said that Yale or
Harvard men would not be sent
away as ours are. We have few
rules here; just the rules of decen
cy and the statutes of California,
but the people who do not follow
these we do not want.
