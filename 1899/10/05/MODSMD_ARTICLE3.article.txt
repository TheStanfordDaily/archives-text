In presenting this list of new stu
dents the Daily Palo Alto is fol-
Jovving the precedent set by former
editors in publishing the names
for ready reference in order that as
complete a list as may be made can
be known, so that the paper with
the register will approximately
contain the names of all those now
in college. The publication comes
a little later this year on account
of the additional work made for
the Registrar by the new system
of study cards.
