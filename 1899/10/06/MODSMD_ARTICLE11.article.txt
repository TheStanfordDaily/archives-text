The managers of the chiss foot
ball teams have arranged a sched
ule of games to he played next
week. Inter-class games have not
been played here since the fall of
'9(>, and it now rests with the play
ers whether this year's series will
be a success. The value of class
games in bringingout new material
cannot be overestimated, and it is
to be hoped that all men who are
able to play at all will come out
and try for positions.
