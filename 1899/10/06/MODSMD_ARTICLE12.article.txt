At a University where all one's
time is spent in learning what has
been done in the past, it is per
haps only natural that the college
man should have to fight the ten
dency to grow unpractical, to lose
interest in the affairs of the world
out of college, and to join the class
characterized by Professor Fetter
as " intellectual tramps." Our
president and faculty have pro
vided, whenever possible, antidotes
for such a tendency bv the sermon

on Sunday, Tuesday lectures, and
talks by the famous men who visit
the University, and by their en
couragement of healthy athletics.
It is a good sign that the Tuesday
lectures are well attended, that
talks by such men as Professor
James of Harvard, Professor Rolfe
and Hon. John T. Barrett are en
thusiastically received.
