# The 						Stanford "Alumnus."
## 
### 
The second number of the Stan
ford Alumnus, but the hrst to ap
pear since the opening of the col
lege year, was isswd today. 1 lie
publication is a model of typograph
ical neatness, and its subject mat
ter reflects great credit upon its
editors, Charles E. Schwartz, 99,
and Miss Helen Swett, '00. Its
cardinal cover will serve to keep
alive the Stanford spirit among the
graduates. The Alumni Associa
tion has an official organ of which
it can be proud.
