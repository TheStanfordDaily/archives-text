# The 						"Chaparral."
## 
### 
The Chaparral made its initial
appearance yesterday and seems to
deserve a place among student
publications. The drawings are
very good and above the standard
of Eastern college magazines of the
same class. The press work and
general typography are particularly
good, making a neat and attractive
pamphlet. In the succeeding issues
there will be an increased number
of pages.
