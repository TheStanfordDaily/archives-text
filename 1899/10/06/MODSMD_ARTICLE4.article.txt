Dear Sir: We, the undersign

Department of Economics and So

behalf of the four hundred students
working with us, desire to express
to you our heartiest thanks, for
your generous contribution of book t>
in political science, administration,
municipal government, and related
subjects. We have long stood in

need of an ample library, and no
gift therefore could have been more
timely and more useful. By so
large a donation you have not only
aided our undergraduate teaching,
but have given a stimulus to re
search in our department which
will have, we trust, notable re
sults.
You shall have the depth of our
appreciation by making it our care
to put the books you have given to
their best use and to make them of
the utmost service to political
thought and life in California.
