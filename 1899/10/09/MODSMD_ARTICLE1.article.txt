# A 						TIE GAME.
## Varsity Meets the Olympics in a Closely Contested Game.—Neither Team Scores. 
### 
Saturday the Varsity eleven
went up against the heavy-weights
of the Olympic Club and came out
with a tie. The grounds at Six
teenth and Folsoin streets had
been hastily constructed, and al
though soft were not du.«ty. Both
teams played slow ball on account
of the heat and few brilliant plays
were made.
The game started with the kick
off hy Murphy. Olympic ran in
five yards, when tackled by the
Stanford ends. Olympic began
bucking the line and slowly forced
the ball towards Stanford's goal.
Carter, Wilson, and Thierkauf were
sent at the Stanford tackles ami
always made gains. W hen within
the Stanford twenty-yard line,
Wilso fumbled and Stanford got
the ball. Murphy punted for
thirty-five yards, Carter fumbled the
ball and Rice fell on it within the
Olympic's tifteen yard-line. Mur
phy tried a drop kick for goal but
Hobbs broke through and blocked
the kick. Murphy regained pos
session of the ball. Parker was
sent around the end for fifteen
yards and Rodolph gained one
through the center. Another drop
kick was attempted but failed.
Cadwallader kicked off from tiie
twenty-five-yard line. Rodolph
fumbled and the ball went to Olym
pic. The club men worked I ..
hall down to Stanford's t wen ty- five -
yard line when time was called for
the first half.
Ln the second half Cadwallader
kicked off for forty yards. Murphy
ran it in and returned the kick.
Wilson was stopped. Olympic
tried the fake kick with a loss.
Stanford obtained the ball five
yards from the center of the field.
Allen made three yards. Stanford
was awarded three yards for off
side play. Olympic made a few
bucks and Stanford got the ball on
the twenty five-yard line on downs.
After a failure to gain, Murphy
punted out of danger. Thierkauf
made five, bringing the ball to the
Stanford's twenty-five-vard line.
Here the Varsity made a magnifi
cent stand, and after three ineffect
ual attempts at the line, Murphy
punted fully forty-five yards.
Leavitt downed Djnsmore before
the latter could run the ball in,
Tierkauf punted fifteen yards. Mur
phy followed suit for forty. Mc-
Fadden caught Sheeliy back of the
line, Dinsmore made the prettiest
run of the game around the end,
bringing it thirty yards nearer the
chalk, Stanford got the ball on
downs and Murphy kicked thirty
five yards. Felton Taylor made
gains by a series of vicious bucks.
Time wascalled without a score be
ing made in the game with the ball
almost on the kick-off spot and in
Olympic's possession. The work
of the Stanford line was a surprise
to most of the onlookers. Traegar
and Graves at guards played a
stubborn up-hill game against Cad
wallader and Hobbs, although Ihe
two latter played a better game,
Roth Rice and McFadden at ends
played well for Stanford. Parker
ami Rice did some good do*

fensive work. Olympic was rather
slow in the formation of their inter
ference, and at times played too
slow. Sheehy and Erskine made
frequent gains.
The Btnr work of the whole match
was Murphy's punting. This was
the only thing that kept the Olym
pic's from scoring.
