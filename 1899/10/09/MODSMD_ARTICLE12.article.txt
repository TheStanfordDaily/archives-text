We have every reason to feel en
couraged over the showing made by
our football team last .Saturday.
Before the game the most sanguine
placed the score ;it 12 0 in favor of
Olympics; when the men lined up
against the athletic (dub's giants

I there seemed it surety of a bigger
j difference in scoring. But thescore
;of 0-0 tells of :i gritty light by a
I lighter team. What element of
'chance that entered into the calcu
lations was all in favor of Stanford,
and no one can deny either, that,
with the exception of one instance,
we had rather the best of it in de
cisions. The facts remain, how
ever, that a light team with an in
domitable spirit held the Olympic's
line at critical points and played a
clean and courageous defensive
game without a deviation from true
football spirit. Mainly, our encour
agement comes from these facts:
Olympics had a better team than
when she went against Berkeley;
Berkeley had had more training
when she met Olympics than we
had; Berkeley played a team al
most the counterpart of the one
that defeated us last Thanksgiving
—a team that cannot he improved
on to a great degree; Stanford
played a new team, many of the
men inexperienced, and not even as
good a team as we can put on the
Held at present, a team which has
not played as a team before, and
one that is capable of great im
provement during the season The
lesson of the game is that we have
more to base our hopes on for p
Thanksgiving day victory than we
thought we had.
