# Freshmen vs. Tamalpais.
## 
### 
The Kreslunan game on the cam
pus Saturday resulted in a victory
over the Military Academy hy ihe
score of 11 to 0. While the Var
sity game against the Olympics
was going on in the city a large
crowd of rooters here encouraged
the naughty-three team.
No scoring was done in the first
half, and the bill was not near
either goal. Prospects were for an
other lie game, hut in the second
half the men from Tamalpais weak
ened and the hall was rushed
through for a touch-down. Raitt
failed at goal. After some ex
change of •punts the visitors were
held for three downs and the Fresh
men began to gain steadily. Wil
lotH and Jordan did some vigorous
hnckingand Raitt made a beauti
ful run around the end; lie was
aided by some skillful interference
on the part of the linemen. The
hall was soon pushed over the line,
and Raitt kicked goal.
The game was further evidence of
the fact that our Freshmen have a
strong team. Several freshmen
were playing in the city. Perhaps
the most prominent feature was the
work of Raitt,captain and fullback.
His kicks were for the most part
sure, and he showed endurance and
clearheadedness. Willots and
Jordan did good work, and were
heartily applauded.
