### 
The faculty of Stanford Univer
sity gave a banquet to President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler and the
faculty of the University of Cali
fornia at the Merchants' Club of
San Francisco on last Saturday
evening. The affair had been in
contemplation since President
Wheeler's election last summer and
was given for the purpose of bring
ing the faculties of the two univer
sities together more closely than
i lie}' have been before, nod of intro
ducing to President Wheeler his
co-workers in education at Stan
ford,
President Jordan presided and
acted us toastmaster. Most of the
faculty of the two universities were
present, as were also Professor
Henry Rolfe of the University of
Chicago, Timothy Hopkins and
S. F. Leib of the Hoard of Trustees
of Stanford University, l>i. Lester
F. Ward, and Mayor Phelan of
San Francisco. The speakers of
the evening were: President
Wheeler, Professors Joseph Pe
Conte and Bernard Moses of Berke
ley; Professors J. M. Stillman and
W. 11. Hudson of Stanford, and
Mayor Phelan.
Jn the course of his remarks
President Wheeler gave utterance
to many pleasantries as well as
thoughts in more serious vein. In
part he said:
" There can be no enmity be
tween the University of California
and Stanford University." "The
only enemy that both must oppose
is barbarism. There is rivalry be
tween the two universities. 1 hear
that there is a faculty baseball
team at Stanford. Very good, if
President .Jordan is good for first
base perhaps I can do the first base
act myself. It might be a good
idea for two faculty teams to give
an exhibition in San Francisco.
"This lovely land of California
with its cheery sympathy and
warm welcome seems like a well
lighted room in a comfortable
In me; and I feel at home in it
already."
President Wheeler told of hum
orous alleged happenings among
the faculty at Cornell years ago.
He thought that he had never seen
such an interesting collection of
wild animals. There was one pro
fessor who decided on the basis of
figures whether a student had
passed the inebritv line by ascer
taining how many drinks he had
had; then by figuring out the
number of ounces of alcohol and
other ingredients that he had ab
sorbed; then by estimating the
effect upon the human system that
must ensue. When he had figured
this all out with pencil and paper
he would vote to discharge or re
tain a student suspected of being
drunk entirely on the basis of his
mathematical totals.
One man judged whether the
(ilee Club should lie allowed to
leave town on a basis of science;
another discarded science and de
termined whether a student should
go home to see his sister married
on the hasis of researches in medi
evalism. No two professors were

jever known to agree on anything,
and that made tliem enjoyable to
eontempla te.
In serious mood President
W heeler spoke of Andrew I). While
of Cornell as a shining
Yesterday he had a letter from
him. Due passage in the letter
was: ''If ynu si11(1 Jordan stand
together, Wheeler, you may he
a hie to do it great deal of good for
ci vi I iza t ion."
The committee in charge of the
banquet was composed of Profes
sors K. E. Allardice, chairman;
(ieorue (!. Price, W. 11. II mlcon,
V. [j. Kellogg, an i.). M. Stillman.
