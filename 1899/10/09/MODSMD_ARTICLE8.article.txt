# Fancy Dress Reception.
## 
### 
Ruble Hall was a scene of jollity
Friday evening, when the women
of the University were received in
the tastefully decorated hall and
parlors. Aside from the fun of
"dressing up," many of the cos
tumes were ingenious. The new
comers were often greeted with peals
of laughter as some particularly
happy hit appeared.
The scene might have heen taken
for a congress of nations; there were
gypsies, Chinese, an Algerian,
canny Scotchmen, ami a plentiful
sprinkling of darkies who took part
in the cake-walk with all the ardor
of their race. There were all sorts
and conditions of mankind.
The Examiner and the Chronicle
appeared, and also the Daily Palo
Alto.
There were some Greeks, a cowled
monk, a little princess and a sweet
faced nun, two or three Japanese
ladies, a French maid, little l>o'
peep, and a host of other people
who are not accustomed to mingle
in society touether.
Many wore simply evening suits
and came to look on with the ladies
of the Faculty and to enjoy the
da neing.
"Topsy" delighted the company
with a very skillfully executed
dance. The reception was perhaps
the most enjoyable ever given by
the women of the University.
