tion of hats, banners, and insignia
and emblems in general for the
Thanksgiving day game was thor
oughly discussed and referred to a
committee of live to be appointed
by the president. The systematiz
ing of tlie yelling, with iheadoption
of the new yell)* and perfecting of

Perhaps the most important
question that came np was in
volved in the proposition stated by
Mr. Leiter, treasurer, in regard to
the future athletic development of
the University, lie stated two
general plans: First, that the As
sociated Students should ascertain
as soon as possible where the per
manent athletic Held will be lo
cated, and set to work to put it in
shape as to drainage, position, etc.;
second, that the training house
plan should be made a student body
enterprise instead of a class one.
The class of 99 started the train
ing house fund, and the money it
collected is now in the hands of Dr.
Murray, during the absence from
the University of Dr. the
permanent tieasurer of the und.
it was decided that Treasurer
Letter should appoint a committee
of live, to act with him in preparing
plans for beginning active work at
once.
Mr. Anthony Snzallo, '99, was
elected as a member of the intercol
legiate debating committee.
Treasurer Leiler presented the
signed contract for the Tivoli thea
ter on Thanksgiving night. A
comic opera will he presented,
probably " The Idol's Eye."
Neidig, '90, and Irwin, '99, pro
posed to present an original play,
but it was decided that on the
whole ihe performance at theTivoli
would be more satisfactory, espec
ially since "local hits" would be
introduced during the performance,
and the student body would be re
lieved from all work and worry in
the matter.
