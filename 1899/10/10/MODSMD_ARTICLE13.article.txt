The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students has taken lip
the training house and athletic
field propositions, making them
student hody enterprises, and giv
ing them precedence in both semes
ters, and it now appears that we
are in a fair way toward that long
desired end â€”a. good campus field,
enclosed by an ornamental fence
and completed with adequate and
tasteful buildings. Such a lield
would tend considerably toward
putting Coast athletics on a par at
least with the Middle West, and
would attract athletes to Stanford.
It would enable us to conduct
campus games at a profit instead of
the present city practice games,
which are generally a financial loss.
It is so much u consummation de
voutly to be wished that it does not
seem inadvisable to contract a stu
dent body debt in order to push the
matter as far and fast as possible.
