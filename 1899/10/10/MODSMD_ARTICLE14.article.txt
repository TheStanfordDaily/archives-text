Twice now within the memory of
the Senior class have attempts heen
made to change the yell. The at
tempt made in the fall of ".)(> was a
failure. Another is being made
this fall. Jt is to the interest of no
one to change the yell. Jt may he
for the interest of Stanford. The
decision rests with the student
hody. We want the hest veil we
can have. What we must do is to
give both yells, decide which one
we liUe better, and yell it. Every
old graduate who returns to the
University notices a great change.
We can no longer sing " Nor bowed
to blue and goid." Our drinking
song is a relic of the time when
there was a "Little Yen." The
impetus received from the old men
has carried lis through the last, few
years, without any substantial ad*
dition to our songs and yells. The
'95 and '!)(> men met the conditions
with which they were confronted.
We must have more songs. We
need more yells. The Executive

Committee has made a call for new
songs and yells, and it is to be
hoped that a large number will be
contributed.
