# Football Practice.

### 
The first, and second elevens lined
up last night for about twenty
minutes' practice, and played a
good stiff game. The men were sore
from Saturday's game with the
Olympic team. Smith, '03, was
tried at half on the second team
and ran well with the hall. Allen
played a h.dfon the first eleven and
made several good gains.
Two other elevens were lined up
later. Nourse and Parkin, halves,
made long runs around the ends,
liaitt, at quarter, on the fourth
team, played a fine game, tackling
well and backing up the line.
The band was out for the first
time and added to the enthusiasm.
The bleachers were well filled, with
probably the largest crowd of the
season.

first and second elevens:
