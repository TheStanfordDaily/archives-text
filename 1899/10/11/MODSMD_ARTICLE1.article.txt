# PRES. WHEELER'S ADDRESS.
## Berkeley's New President Speaks to Stanford Students on Intercollegiate Relations. 
### 
The chapel was packed and lined
with students on Tuesday afternoon
long before the time announced for
President Wheeler's address. On
his arrival at the chapel, Berkeley's
new president was welcomed by
three yells—that of Cornell, that of
U. C., and lastly by a genuine
Stanford roar.
President Wheeler was intro
duced by Dr. Jordan, and was
warmly greeted by the audience.
The following brief notes will give
a fair synopsis of his remarks.
'T have been in California only
two weeks, yet 1 feel at home ill
ready. I feel at home here at
Stanford, for 1 find here the old
Cornell spirit that 1 have learned
to love. This spirit consists in a
devotion at all hazards to Truth;
and it means liberality, largeness
of heart, in the acceptance of all
efforts in pursuit of truth.
" But I miss here one thing
which at Cornell we considered as
identified with the place. Why is
it that you have not here a crew?
I have followed the history and de
velopment of college rowing so
closely during the past ten years
that I can hardly imagine college
athletics without a rowing crew.
Now 1 beg of you; before 1 iro any
further —students of Stanford - go
down to the hay here and fi id a
place where you can row! Do it
for the good of the University of
California. Add that to your many
beneficences. Don't let another
year go by before two eight-oar
crews shall meet somewhere on the
blue waters of California, and
speed along toward the finish line.
'• I believe in diversity in athlet
ics as well as in studies. I am a
thorough believer in football. It
is a thoroughly \ nglo-Saxon game;
there is nothing effeminate about
it. But what 1 most appreciate is
team work -co-operation between
men. This is attempted in foot
ball, but it is more evident when
eight men in a boat are trained to
a regular clock-like motion. The'
again, rowing is a clean sport, for
it gets men out on the clear water,
and water is essentially clean. Now
find a place to row, and get a boat.
Start the men at Berkeley up and
make it hard for them to beat
you."
Referring to a letter from Pro
fessor White of Cornell, who is now
in Europe, President Wheeler said:
" I have known no man so free
from private ambitions or selfish
ness, as Andrew I). White. 1 have
tinny times seen him meet the
struggle between a selfi-di action
and one which is of broader good,
and I have never seen him in
fluenced by petty motives. He,
more than any other man, is re
sponsible for the 'Cornell idea.'
" We frequently hear people talk
against the smaller colleges. My
experience has been rather favor
able to men from smaller colleges
I find they have been put through
a better mill; they are capable of
sustained attention to one subject,
more so than the average graduate
of Vale, Harvard, Pennsylvania, or
Princeton. I do not like to hear

people sneer at small or sectarian
colleges; we ought not t<> sheer at
any good effort. There are ever so
many people who would take no
interest in colleges were it not for
their churches. Many are per
suaded by the clergy to take a col
lege course. Then the small col
leges are often of value because of
their location. The mere question
of travel is a considerable matter.
Many a young man goes to college
merely because it happens to he
located in a neighboring town."
President Wheeler then explained
the difference between a private and
a State university, and gave many
examples, classifying the large uni
versities of the East. 14 The private
institution," he said, "is more pli
able. It is more available for the
special studies of science and liter
ature. Let it use its advantages.
The State university appeals to
State pride; it receives money from
the Legislature, and derives many
advantages from its official posi
tion. Let it use its advantages.
Now, you will doubtless pursue
vourown policy here, and it will he
a good one, but you must take
pride in the university of this State.
I want you to feel that the univer
sity at Berkeley is your university.
1 want Stanford men to help us. 1
want you to persuade the State to
give us money. We have got to
gether in the same cause. We have
got together to hold up the torch of
Education. We have but one mu
tual enemy, and that is barbarism.
" Many people seem to think
that a university is a sort of bureau
drawer, where pears are put to
ripen. I here is some truth in that
notion, a great deal of ripening
goes on in college, but I don't like
the bureau drawer idea. The
highest education is reached, not
in bureau-drawer life, not in a
cloister life, nor in the life of a
chapterhouse; but it must be in
contact with the common life of
men.
"A few years ago business men
did not put much faith in univer
sity graduates. Today we see uni
versity men entering all the offices
of Wall street. We find them in
public life, in law, and in journal
ism. Something is abroad in the
university lite that is new. Today
the university is giving men power.
It is not what a man remembers,
but what he can do. A student in
the university had better study
what will give him power, and in
sight, and perspective; what will
enable him to sail into the eye of
the wind—ms J hope the Columbia
is doing today. He must study
those things that will give him a
keel. What is the use of ropes and
pulleys, of broad sails and a very
tall mast, if you have not a keel?
"Now Stanford and the Univer
sity of California will go on, each
according to its own policy. At
Berkeley we must, to a certain ex
tent, follow out the customs and
precedents already established.
What shaping is done there must
be done by time. But we must re
member that we are traveling in
the same direction, we are headed
to the same goal; and so I say—
May God bless Stanford, and the
University of California, and make
them useful for the State of Cal
ifornia! "

May God bless Stanford, and the
University of California, and make
them useful for the State of Cal
ifornia! "
The chapel was packed and lined
with students on Tuesday afternoon
long before the time announced for
President Wheeler's address. On
his arrival at the chapel, Berkeley's
new president was welcomed by
three yells—that of Cornell, that of
U. C., and lastly by a genuine
Stanford roar.
President Wheeler was intro
duced by Dr. Jordan, and was
warmly greeted by the audience.
The following brief notes will give
a fair synopsis of his remarks.
'T have been in California only
two weeks, yet 1 feel at home ill
ready. I feel at home here at
Stanford, for 1 find here the old
Cornell spirit that 1 have learned
to love. This spirit consists in a
devotion at all hazards to Truth;
and it means liberality, largeness
of heart, in the acceptance of all
efforts in pursuit of truth.
" But I miss here one thing
which at Cornell we considered as
identified with the place. Why is
it that you have not here a crew?
I have followed the history and de
velopment of college rowing so
closely during the past ten years
that I can hardly imagine college
athletics without a rowing crew.
Now 1 beg of you; before 1 iro any
further —students of Stanford - go
down to the hay here and fi id a
place where you can row! Do it
for the good of the University of
California. Add that to your many
beneficences. Don't let another
year go by before two eight-oar
crews shall meet somewhere on the
blue waters of California, and
speed along toward the finish line.
'• I believe in diversity in athlet
ics as well as in studies. I am a
thorough believer in football. It
is a thoroughly \ nglo-Saxon game;
there is nothing effeminate about
it. But what 1 most appreciate is
team work -co-operation between
men. This is attempted in foot
ball, but it is more evident when
eight men in a boat are trained to
a regular clock-like motion. The'
again, rowing is a clean sport, for
it gets men out on the clear water,
and water is essentially clean. Now
find a place to row, and get a boat.
Start the men at Berkeley up and
make it hard for them to beat
you."
Referring to a letter from Pro
fessor White of Cornell, who is now
in Europe, President Wheeler said:
" I have known no man so free
from private ambitions or selfish
ness, as Andrew I). White. 1 have
tinny times seen him meet the
struggle between a selfi-di action
and one which is of broader good,
and I have never seen him in
fluenced by petty motives. He,
more than any other man, is re
sponsible for the 'Cornell idea.'
" We frequently hear people talk
against the smaller colleges. My
experience has been rather favor
able to men from smaller colleges
I find they have been put through
a better mill; they are capable of
sustained attention to one subject,
more so than the average graduate
of Vale, Harvard, Pennsylvania, or
Princeton. I do not like to hear

people sneer at small or sectarian
colleges; we ought not t<> sheer at
any good effort. There are ever so
many people who would take no
interest in colleges were it not for
their churches. Many are per
suaded by the clergy to take a col
lege course. Then the small col
leges are often of value because of
their location. The mere question
of travel is a considerable matter.
Many a young man goes to college
merely because it happens to he
located in a neighboring town."
President Wheeler then explained
the difference between a private and
a State university, and gave many
examples, classifying the large uni
versities of the East. 14 The private
institution," he said, "is more pli
able. It is more available for the
special studies of science and liter
ature. Let it use its advantages.
The State university appeals to
State pride; it receives money from
the Legislature, and derives many
advantages from its official posi
tion. Let it use its advantages.
Now, you will doubtless pursue
vourown policy here, and it will he
a good one, but you must take
pride in the university of this State.
I want you to feel that the univer
sity at Berkeley is your university.
1 want Stanford men to help us. 1
want you to persuade the State to
give us money. We have got to
gether in the same cause. We have
got together to hold up the torch of
Education. We have but one mu
tual enemy, and that is barbarism.
" Many people seem to think
that a university is a sort of bureau
drawer, where pears are put to
ripen. I here is some truth in that
notion, a great deal of ripening
goes on in college, but I don't like
the bureau drawer idea. The
highest education is reached, not
in bureau-drawer life, not in a
cloister life, nor in the life of a
chapterhouse; but it must be in
contact with the common life of
men.
"A few years ago business men
did not put much faith in univer
sity graduates. Today we see uni
versity men entering all the offices
of Wall street. We find them in
public life, in law, and in journal
ism. Something is abroad in the
university lite that is new. Today
the university is giving men power.
It is not what a man remembers,
but what he can do. A student in
the university had better study
what will give him power, and in
sight, and perspective; what will
enable him to sail into the eye of
the wind—ms J hope the Columbia
is doing today. He must study
those things that will give him a
keel. What is the use of ropes and
pulleys, of broad sails and a very
tall mast, if you have not a keel?
"Now Stanford and the Univer
sity of California will go on, each
according to its own policy. At
Berkeley we must, to a certain ex
tent, follow out the customs and
precedents already established.
What shaping is done there must
be done by time. But we must re
member that we are traveling in
the same direction, we are headed
to the same goal; and so I say—
May God bless Stanford, and the
University of California, and make
them useful for the State of Cal
ifornia! "
