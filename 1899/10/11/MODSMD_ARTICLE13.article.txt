Lath Litkkaky Nkws.— The
present generation is only now
coming to understand the mean
ing of the word "work." It ap
plies to all classes, rich and poor
alike, and Mrs. Charlotte Perkins
Stetson has undertaken 10 make
this clear in her article, "What
Work is," which appears in the
October Cosmopolitan. Under the
title of''Christian Science and the
Book of Mrs. Kddy," Mark Twain
contributes to the same number
what is the most remarkable mag
azine article of the month, if not of
the year. Twain discloses two
phases of himself—the humorist

and the keen, far-sighted philoso
pher. He handles the cult a hit
severely, perhaps, but he has his
reasons for so doing and sets them
forth most forcibly. His state
ment concerning Mrs. Eddy's book
is characteristic. Of it he says:
"It is the first time since the dawn
of creation that a. voice has gone
crushing through space with such
placid and complacent confidence
and command." In addition, Frank
11. Stockton and Maarten Maar
tens lend their pens to enhance the
number's general excellence, and
there is a third story by a writer
not so well known, but of great
promise. Maarten Maartens con
tributes one of his scintillating
sketches of high life under the title
of "Lady Mary's Mistake"; Frank
11. Stockton tells, through his most
interesting gardener "John Gay
tlier," a story of Italian life based
on suspended animation, and
Elmore Elliott Peake, in his story,
"Out of the Shadow," has a power
ful tale of a fight between love and
death, in which love wins.
