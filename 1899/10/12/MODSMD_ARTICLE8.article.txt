It was with the deepest regret
that we 'earned of the death by
drowning of Will A. Snow. While
he was not a Stanford graduate, he
was essentially a Stanford man in
thought and action and the ablest
of that band of Stanford reporters
of the San Francisco Chronicle. It
seems incredible, too, that a man of
such ability and courage should
meet death in such a way; should
simply go out into the darkness
and be lost, a victim of the waters
from which he had at one time res
cued a fellow reporter at the risk of
his own life. He was the water
front writer for his paper, and was
thus known very well about the
bay, where every one respected and
admired "Snow of the Chronicle"
for his thorough gentlemanliness
and intrepid spirit. At the time
the Sherman came in bearing the
California boys, Snow was sent out
with a tug to get the news. It was
another "message to Garcia," His
was simply t«• "get the news " He
had learned that the representa
tives of a rival paper were aboard
the transport, and he realized what
every newspaper man knows, that
it is as bad to be "scooped" in that
profession as it is for a soldier to
turn his back to the enemy. It was
simply his duty to board the trims
port at any cost. The tug went
alongside, he grasped a rope ladder
that led up the towering white sides
of the Sherman and started to
climb up. A customs officer and
members of the crew blocked his
passage, jumping on his head and
shoulders, and grinding with their
heels the hands that clung to the
bars of the ladder. Snow saw that
to get aboard was an impossibility,
but he clung to the ladder, shout- i
ing interrogations to the Stanford'
men he knew on the transport in '
order to get all the news he could
before he had to drop, for his hands |
were being crushed and mangled;
he was on the rolling side of the
steamer, beneath him the black
water between the pitching tug and
the transport, where, had he fallen
he would likely have been crushed
to death when a wave sent his boat
against the steamer. It was by the

merest chance that he managed to
get down in safety, for he was half
fainting with pain and nearly ex
hausted. As the little tug turned
city-ward three cheers went up for
Snow, and that night he was a hero
to the returned volunteers. The
next morning his paper had the
"story" of the volunteers, hut no
one knew at what cost. At the
time he met his death he was try
ing to get the news from his old
friend and college-mate, General
Funston, when a wave carried him
off the launch, which was made fast
to the transport which brought
home the "fighting Kansans." in
spirit he was one of them, courage
ous, indomitable, hut withal cour
teous and gentle. He died doing
his duty.
