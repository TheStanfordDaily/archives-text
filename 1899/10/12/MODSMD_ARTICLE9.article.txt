President Wheeler's warm
championship of the sport, of rowing
recalls the attempt made at the
opening of the University to make
this one of the intercollegiate events
of the year. Senator Stanford
warmly favored it, and attempts
were made to organize a crew. The
training for the most part was done
on the rowing machines of the
gymnasium, as is done in many of
the eastern colleges, as the uiily
available place for practice was
Lake Lagunita,and this was totally
inadequate to the needs of the crew.
The difficulties which faced the
| athletes of six years ago are still
present, and it is these difficulties
which preclude the idea of the for
mation oi a crew at the present
time. There is no available place
for training. At Cornell, where
rowing has been highly specialized,
three-fourths of the training is done
on a narnw inlet which leads
through the marshes. At Harvard
and Vab water facilities are con
veniently located, and at the State
University of Wisconsin there is a
choice of four lakes for practice.
Here is where the difficulty comes
with Stanford. There are no water
facilities that are accessible. The
marshes contain no inlets suitable
for practice, and the use of the bay
is for several reasons not feasible.
Its distance from the college makes
it impracticable in the first place,
but the more serious objection is
the expense which would be en
tailed in providing suitable quar
ters. On account of the condition
of the mud flats during low tide, it
would be necessary to build a wharf
a mile out, and this, at the present
time, is out of the question. The
Faculty Athletic Committee are
heartily in favor of promoting row
ing as a college sport, and are es
sentially in sympathy with Presi
dent Wheeler's views, but realize
that until u suitable training place
can be found, nothing can be done.
