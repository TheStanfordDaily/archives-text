# ON THE GRIDIRON.
## Last Night's Practice. — Campus Games Tomorrow.— Olympic-Berkeley Game. 
### 
After the Sophomore-Freshman
game two elevens were lined up lor
a short practice. A touch-down
was made for the second by Pollard
who broke through the line and
stole the ball from Wardall's
hands. A few minutes later the
second, by repeated end runs and
good line bucking, carried the ball
over the line for another touch
down. Ehrichs and Pollard played
a good game behind the line for
the second. Luck did good work
in tackling until he was compelled
to leave the field on account of a
severe kick on the head.
"Teddy" Berwick was out for
the first time and played at guard.
He is probably the strongest man
on the field and showed up well
last night. With a little practice
he will make a hard fight for his
opponent.

Tomorrow afternoon if the
weather permits two games w.ll be
played on the campus. At 2 p.m.
the Palo Alto High School team
will meet the team from the San
Jose Normal and, as soon as their
game is finished, the Freshmen
will play the Santa Clara College
team. The freshmen are just be
ginning to get their team organized
and this game will give an oppor
tunity of forming some idea of the
style of game the Freshmen can
expected to play. The date of the
Berkeley-Stanford Freshman game
i< the 28th of this month ami the
Freshmen will be given stiff work
from now on. One price of admis
sion will be charged for both games
tomorrow in order that as large a
crowd as possible will be out to
encourage the players.
Berkeley and the Olympics will
play the third game of the series
tomorrow afternoon at the Sixteenth
and Folsom street grounds. In the
first match between these same
teams two weeks ago the Berkeley
men won by a score of 0-0. The
Olympic Club men have lieen
practicing steadily since and are
expected to put up a strong game
tomorrow. Olympic will play
practically the same team which
met Stanford in the tie game of last
Saturday. The Berkeley team will
be composed of the same men who
played two weeks ago with the ex
ception of Captain Whipple, who is
laid off with an injured shoulder.
The men will be changed off during
the game that new men may be
giveil a trial.
A number of students will go up
from here to witness the game.
