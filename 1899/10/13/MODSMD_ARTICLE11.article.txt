If the showing made by the
Freshman team in yesterday's
match is any indication of the kind
of game they are capable of play
ing it is very evident that some
thing will have to be done if the
Freshmen to bring back a
victory on October 28th. The time
is short and the men can look for
nothing but good hard work from
now on to the day of the game. We
have seen how a light team with
plenty of grit can overcome a heav
ier team which depends upon its
own weight. The victories which
our Freshman teams have won
from their Berkeley rivals have
been gained by hard work against
heavy odds. But we dislike to
see a team lose heart and play in a
listless manner, as in yesterday's
contest; when men seem afraid to
tackle their opponents for fear of
hurting themselves, and get out of
the way of the runner, instead of
trying to bring him down. If the
Freshman class Wish to gain honor
for themselves and their University
in their coming intercollegiate
match, they must get together
speedily and work together for the
one end â€”to win the intercollegiate
Freshman game at all cost. To
morrow the team will be given an
other opportunity for a practice
game on the University
with the encouraging influence of
their own classmates on the bleach
ers. Let them then demonstrate
that they have in them the foot
ball spirit which has characterized
the playing of our former teams.
