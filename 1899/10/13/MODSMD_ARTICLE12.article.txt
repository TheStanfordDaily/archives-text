How important natural enthu
siasm is to effective yelling is not
always recognized in attempts to
strengthen the encouragement given
hy spectators to athletes. At the
every-day practice one cannot
blame the bleachers for poor yelling
when the men in the field are doing
nothing but tackling or falling upon

the ball. But when an actual game
begins, then it is that they should
forget themselves in their ap
plause and follow the yell- j
leader as one man. The
evening before a few men made
the halls of Encina ring when the
lights unexpectedly went out.
What becomes of this spirit in the
afternoon? Is it that the object is
less interesting or so frequent as to
lose its attractiveness for enthusi
asm? We scarcely believe our
men are extremely diffident, but
until they show upon the athletic
fields that same genuine spirit of
enthusiasm which these unex
pected jollifications bring out, we
have aright to accuse them of with
holding some part of the encour
agement of which they are capable.
Habit is undoubtedly of consider
able effect in this regard. Class
games therein find much excuse.
It is well recognized that few other
contests are of as general interest
and consequently few others arouse
such spontaneous encouragement
from the onlookers. That they
should cr< wd down from their seats
to the ropes should be accepted as
a sign of enthusiasm which cannot
be but beneficial. Our interests
lie, not in suppressing thebe spon
taneous outbursts, but in bringing
them out whenever possible.
