The death of William Appleton
Snow, reporter for the San Fran-

Cisco Chronicle and lately Assist
ant in Entomology in the Leland
Stanford Junior University, who
was drowned on the night of Octo
ber 10th in San Francisco Hay,
arouses peculiar sorrow. Taken
away, as he was, in the faithful
pursuit of the duties of his chosen
profession, his youth, his zeal, his
success, and the promise so abund
antly given of larger success in the
future, all make the fatal accident
the occasion for profound regret.
Wherefore, in recognition of the
scholarly abilities and attain
ments, and of his many manly
and sociable qualities, the Faculty
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University desire to make this
record of their sense of loss and of
their sympathy with his family
and friends.
