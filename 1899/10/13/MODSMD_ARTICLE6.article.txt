Part second is to be devoted to
the rendition of a quaint and at
tractive little cantata called the
"Old Melodeon."
Friends who sang in by gone

their earlier years, and in various
touching and familiar songs bring
back memories of the old melodeon.
The entire program will be well
worth hearing. The price of ad
