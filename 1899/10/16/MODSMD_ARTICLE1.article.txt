### 
At 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon
the San Jose Normal School eleven
lined up against the Palo Alto
High School in their first game of
the Amateur Athletic League. The
field was heavy from the rain and
the game was slow. The normal
team won by a score of 17 to 0.
At four o'clock the Freshmen
lined up against an eleven from
Santa Clara College. Raitt, Allen,
and Parker were unable to line up
on account of injuries received
Thursday. Santa Clara kept the
ball in Freshman territory nearly
the entire first half. Just before
time was called the Freshmen
rushed the ball down the tield in
good style, but were prevented from
scoring by time being called.
Santa Clara scored two touch
downs, one in each half, McGee
Kicking goal for both. McGee,
captain, played the best game for
the Santa Clara team.
F>r Stanford, the men back of
the line put up a good game, while
Lee, Traegor, and MeFadden
played good ball.

The game between the Berkeley
and Olympic teams was the best of
the series. The weather was good
for foot ha 11 aml with the grou mis in
fair condition touchdowns should
have been made. Gammon, Lipp
inan, and Brougham filled the back
positions in the first half and Hall,
Smith, and Kaarsburg played the
second. The new men played good
ball but were unable to pierce the
heavy line for very large gains.
In the second half both teams
came very near scoring, but a stub
born stand was made by each and
neither line was crossed, the game
ending in a 0-0 score.
The best work for California was
probably done by Smith, Athern,
and Womble, while Code, Dins
more. and Taylor put up the best
game for the club men.
