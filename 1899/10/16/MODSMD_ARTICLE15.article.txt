On Friday afternoon we are to
have a distinguished visitor in
Brigadier General Fred Funston of
the Kansas volunteers. No man
in the land forces in the IMiilip
pines has distinguished himself to
such an extent as has General
Funston, and no one in the land
forces during our entire war with
Spain, with the exception of Gov
ernor Roosevelt. General Funston
is a college man and a close friend
of some of Stanford's men. We
cannot give him too hearty a re
ception.
