The editor of the 1901 Quad
today announces the offer of
prizes for material for the publica
tion of the Junior Class. No more
liberal advances have been made
by any of the former manage
ments, and the number to respond
should he large. The prize money
which the best productions are to
gain should be the least of the in
centives to bringing forth what is
desired, for the greatest reward will
be in the satisfaction that some
thing has been produced worthy of
a Stanford Annual. From some
points of view each volume should
excel the preceding one; and if all
respond now, the Hoard will lie
able to realize this theory. We
should all remember that a college
annual is taken by ont-siders lo be
the best work of a university, not
of some individual class.
