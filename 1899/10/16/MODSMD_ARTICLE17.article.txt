Saturday, the University of Penn
sylvania was defeated !>y the Car
lisle Indians by a score of 1(5 to 5.
The Indians won because they
played better ball. Pennsylvania's
line was weak and the red men
went through many times for long
gains. The Pennsylvania men were
also weak in tackling, while the
Indians' tackling was hard and
sure. Two goals from the held
were kicked, one by Hudson for the
Indians and the other by Captain
Hare for the university eleven.
The University of Chicago de
feated the Cornell eleven Saturday
by the score of 17 to 6. This is the
first time in the history of intercol
legiate football that a Western team
has defeated a strong Eastern
eleven. Chicago outclassed Cornell
in the quickness with which the
ball was put into play and also
displayed more effective interfer
ence. The Cornell backs tackled
hard and sure, and in this respect
outclassed the Chicago players
who got their men too high.
