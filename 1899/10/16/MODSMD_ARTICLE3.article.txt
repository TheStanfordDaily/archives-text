# Tickets for the Big Game.
## 
### 
Treasurer Leiter and Manager
Minna of Herkeley placed their or
der last Saturday for tickets for
the Thanksgiving game. Nineteen
thousand were ordered: 1,000 hox

seats, 16,000 reserved seats, and
2,000 general admission. The
management this year hopes to
have a somewhat increased seating
capacity, and it is probable that
the contract for the erection of the
stands for the big game will be let
this week. The tickets will be off
the press by November 11th, and
will be placed on sale the fifteenth,
the same time the sale of seals is
opened for the Tivoli comic opera
for Thanksgiving evening.
