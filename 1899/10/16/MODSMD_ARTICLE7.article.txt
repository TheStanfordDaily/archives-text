# GENERAL FUNSTON COMING.
## The 						Roosevelt of the Philippines to Speak in the Chapel Next Friday Afternoon. 
### 
General Fred Funston of the
Kansas volunteers, one of the few
picturesque men of our late war
with Spain, will visit Stanford on
next Friday and will talk to the
students at 3:30 o'clock on that
day.
General Funston will be the
guest of Professor Kellogg while
here, as the two are old chums at
the University of Kansas.
Ever since the War Department
commenced bringing the volunteers
home from the Philippines Profes
sor Kellogg has been planning to
have General Funston visit the
University, and he is therefore
highly elated that the visit can be
brought about. General Funston
is a figure at the present time both
in military and political circles,
and people of his State are now
discussing giving him any office he
desires. Late dispatches mention
him in connection with the United
Stales Senate.
It is barely possible that General
Funston may receive telegraphic
orders which will prevent his com
ing to Stanford, but this is im
probable.
