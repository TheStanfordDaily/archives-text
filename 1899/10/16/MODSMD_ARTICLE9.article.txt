Hie sermon in tlie chapel Sun
cla 3 T by Dr. 0. L. Elliott was on the
topic "The Things that Abide."
I hese, ' said the speaker, " are
'Faith, Hope, and Love.'"
Continuing he detailed the ef
fects which the modern spirit of
scientific research and of religious
criticism had on ihe religions ideas
of the people. The chief result, he
said, was the abolishment of belief
in the arbitrary superiority and
truth of anyone book or creed. The
only danger which might result
was the possible agnosticism and
despair of some persons, but this
danger is counteracted by the pres
ence of faith, hope, and love in the
hearts and homes of men. While
these endured, the best of life re
ma i ned.
