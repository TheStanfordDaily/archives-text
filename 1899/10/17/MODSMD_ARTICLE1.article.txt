# MURPHY FOR COACH.
## The
						Present Football Trainer has been Secured to Coach and Train Baseball and Track Men. 
### 
At Ihe meeting of L lie Executive
Committee held last night in room
11 quad, Managers llaslacher an l
Cantvvell appeared for the baseball
and track interests respectively and
recommended trainer Murphy as
the hest man to (ill both positions,
since the student body is at pres
ent unable to provide for two
coaches.
As far as baseball is concerned,
Murphy is without a peer in the
college world as a coach, having
played four years on Yale's var
sity, two years on the New York
team in the National Eeague, and
having, coached Pennsylvania's
victorious team of last year. In
fact Pennsylvania wants Murphy
to coach again Ibis year, and it
was with some difficulty that he
was persuaded to stay with Stanford
as the Eastern colleges had already
made him liberal offers.
On the track, Murphy is in a
certain sense untried, but he is a
good conditioner, and has had di
rect knowledge of Pennsylvania's
track methods under the coaching
of his brother, ".Mike" Murphy,
acknowledged the master coach and
tiainer of the country.
