Ijast year when the eleven won
their first game from the Olympics
by a larger score than Berkeley had
been able to make, Stanford confi
dence went up with a bound.
Berkeley won the Thanksgiving
game. This year Berkeley's record
against the club men is slightly
better than ours. But the shadow
of 22-0 has not been replaced by a
rainbow glow of confidence. This
year there seems to be the same
spirit on the grid that character
ized the fall of '96. There were
backs to be developed and less old
material to work with than Berke
ley had. But there was a spirit
about the playing that fall that
gave us a score of 20-0. We have
not forgotten the score of last year
and if spirit and determination can
win a game Market street will
see another procession this fall.
