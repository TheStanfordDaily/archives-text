In securing Trainer Murphy to
coach the baseball and track men
a word of commendation is due the
baseball and track management,
and the Executive Committee for
their prompt action in the
matter. Last year we lost the
baseball series through the loss of
Joe Corbett as coach, by dallying
methods in trying to secure him,
and finally allowing him to go to
California. The experience of Mr.
Murphy in baseball circles makes
the selection a particularly good
one. lie has already won his way
into the hearts of the football men
of the University through his care
ful attention (o all and will soon
become a favorite with the men
in other branches of athletics as
well. A call has been issued for
baseball candidates to appear for
practice Thursday afternoon and
if the men will go into the prac
tice with something of the spirit
which the football men display
they can bring back victory next
spring. There can be no doubt
that Mr. Murphy is just the man

to put spirit and ginger into the
men and if they give him their co
operation there will be no question
about the result.
