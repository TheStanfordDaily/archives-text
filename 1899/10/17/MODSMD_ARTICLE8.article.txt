### 
— A banquet was given last
night at the I'alace Hotel to Presi
dent Wheeler hy the Medical De
partment. The entire University
faculty were present as the guests
of the Medical faculty.
—The Freshmen were defeated
at football yesterday by the Lowell

Both teams were evenly matched,
but the Freshmen fell below the
standard of anything they have
done yet this season.
