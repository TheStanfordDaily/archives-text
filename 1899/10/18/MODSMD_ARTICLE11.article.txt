The fault in the report of Mon
day's Executive Committee's meet
ing lies in the use of the term
"leader" for "coach." The discus
sion was on the "coach" simply,
who bears the same relation to the
club as the football coach does to
the team. The present undergradu
ate leader's record on the club and
his ability are well enough known
not to allow the erroneous report
to create a false impression.
