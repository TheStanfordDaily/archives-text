The action of a crowd of students
on the bleachers last night in jeer
ing two young ladies cannot be
too severely condemned. "Joshing"
when confined to students and
those we know is perfectly admis
sible; but this jeering at strangers
and visitors, especially ladies,
should be condemned by every
right-thinking student as a reflec
tion on our student body. It is
understood that the joshing came
from a few freshmen who do not
know better, and this is meant to
set them right.
