The call for baseball candidates
to meet tomorrow on the faculty
club grounds should bring out
everyone who can piny baseball.
There will be a number of places to
be filled on the team this year,
and freshmen who can play should
not neglect to come out. We can
not begin practice too early in
order to form a winning team.
The system of fall practice as in

vogue in the East, if adopted here
and consistently carried out, can
not help but produce most benefi
cial results. An attempt was
made last year to have light fall
practice but it seems to have been
only of a desultory nature and not
rightly adhered to. However with
a thoroughly competent coach and
trainer there should be a revival of
interest in baseball and a more
strict observence in the matter of
training and practice.
