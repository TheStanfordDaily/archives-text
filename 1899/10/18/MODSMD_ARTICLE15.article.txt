—The University of Pennsyl
vania is making efforts to attract
students from Cuba, Porto Rico,
and South America. It has re
cently printed in Spanish data per
taining to its courses of instruction,
rules of admission, and all such

— The authorities of Yale have
made an order prohibiting the em
ployment of student waiters at the
university dining hall. This new

it is for the welfare of the dining
hall. Thirty men are thus thrown
out of employment.
