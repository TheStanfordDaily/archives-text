The Saturday Evening Post in
an article headed "Earning an Ed
ucation,'' has made a thorough ex
amination of the cost of attending
the leading universities and col
leges of the country. The follow
ing questions were sent to the
presidents of the various schools:
1. Jll your opinion, taking all
things into consideration, is the
student paying his own way pre
vented thereby from accomplishing
the best results ?
2. Is the unlimited supply of
money likely to be a handicap to
the average college student ?
3. Of two students having equal
abilities, which has the better
chance for college success, the one
with much or the one with little
money?
To the first question many re
plied emphaticnlly in the negative,
while others believed the student

: paying his own way is likely to be
| hindered from accomplishing the
best results unless he be of unusual
I energy and mental and physical
power.
There was practical unanimity
on the second question, over nine
ty-eight per cent of those sending
replies believing emphatically that
an unlimited amount of money
was a handicap to the average col
lege student. Many believed it
was worse than a handicap.
Along the same line as the opin
ion of the second question, the
large majority believe that of two
students of equal ability, the one
having much money is likely to be
less successful than the one having
less.
The concensus of opinion is that
the student depending entirely
upon himself requires so much
energy for outside work as not to
accomplish the best results. The
one having just a comfortable al
lowance is the one who has chances
most in his favor. The respondent
from the University of Michigan is
of the opinion that "above six
hundred dollars a year is likely to
lie disadvantageous."
The following table gives the
average and minimum expense
and the attendance (last year's) of
some of the leading universities:
