On behalf of myself and the Glee
Club, I wish to correct an erroneous
statement which appeared last
evening in the account of the Ex
ecutive Committee meeting wherein
I, as manager of the Varsity Glee
Ciub, was said to have expressed
"dissatisfaction with the present
leader" and to have requested "that
another be obtained." What I did
was merely to ask the committee to
obtain, according to previous cus
tom. a professional musician to act
as coach to the club and assist the
leader in building up the organiza
tion and selecting the men.
