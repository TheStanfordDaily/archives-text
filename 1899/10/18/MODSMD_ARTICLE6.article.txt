### 
It was current newspaper report
a few months ago that Mark Twain
was writing an autobiography, and
that it would not be published for
a hundred years. This idea, if it
ever existed in the mind of the au
thor, has been given up; but he did
some work on an autobiography,
and one chapter from it, entitled
" My Debut as a Literary Person,"
has been secured by the publishers
of The Century and will appear in
the November number. Dr. Weir
Mitchel's new story, which The
Century Magazine will print in ser
ial form beginning with November,
is called "The Autobiography of a
Quack." Dr. Mitchel has used his
knowledge of the under side of his
profession in a way which is said
to make an unusually attractive
psychological study.
