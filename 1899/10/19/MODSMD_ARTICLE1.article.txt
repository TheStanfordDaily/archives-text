# A 						REMARKABLE CAREER.
## Interesting Incidents in General Funston's Life. 
### 
Professor Kellogg, the friend and
college chum of General Funston,
told yesterday some of the exciting
incidents in the life of the man who
has been, above all, the most prom
inent figure in the war in the
Philippines.
Professor Kellogg said: " Funston
came to Kansas University, but did
not graduate. He left to earn a
living, and started in as newspaper
reporter at Fort Smith, Ark. Here
he had a most remarkable experi
ence, and made a great reputation
for himself, for Fort Smith is fa
mous for its criminal trials, and
Funston knew how to handle them
well. Leaving the newspaper busi
ness, he became train collector for
the Santa Fe Railroad, with head
quarters at New Mexico. Notwith
standing all the stories to the con
trary, Funston was never a cowboy.
"He was then appointed special
agent of the division of botany of
the U. S. Department of Agricul
ture. His work consisted in mak
ing collections in dangerous places.
He was sc.it to Death Valley, Cali
fornia, and while there had a nar
row escape from death. He started
to go 150 miles for mail for the
party. His horse gave out for want
of water, and he himself became de
lirious from thirst. He finally
stumbled upon a hermit at the edge
of Death Valley, and was thus
saved. With one companion he
followed the main crest of the Sier
ras from Tehacippi Pass north to
Yosemite. He then went to Alaska
for six months, and did so well that
he was sent back again for a year
and a half. His second visit was
made famous for the trip which he
took on foot in the depth of winter
from the heart of Alaska to the
Arctic Ocean. He was accompa
nied b)' a few Indians, whom he
picked up here and there on the
way. He reached the Arctic,
tramped along the shore, and lived
with the Esquimaux. Hecanieacross
the San Francisco whaling fleet
at Herschell Island, and the men
welcomed him as if he had dropped
from the skies. After visiting the
men of the fleet for a week, he
tramped back, a thirty days' trip.
He heard there was an English mis
sionary in the country, and tramped
twelve days to see him. He didn't
like him, stayed one day, and
tramped back.
Funston then gave up his po
sition in the Department of Agri
culture, and went to the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec where he became
interested in coffee growing. He
came back to the United States
to organize a company and went to
New York, where he became the
friend of Theodore Roosevelt, who
recommended him to Harper's as
war correspondent. He made ar
rangements to go to Cuba and write
letters for Harper's' Weekly on the
Spanish-Cuban war. He gave this
up, however, to join ihe Insurgent
army, ha ving become convinced of
the justice of the Cuban cause. He
was made captain of artillery and
displayed remarkable aptitude for
handling men and guns. After the
death of Osgood, the famous Cor-

Nell and Pennsylvania football
player, who was major of artillery,
Funston was promoted. He was
promoted again to Lieutenant Colo
nel, and placed in command of all
the artillery of Gomez' army. He
was on the staff of General Gomez,
and became one of his most trusted
lieutenants. He remained two
years and a half in Cuba, and dur
ing that time participated in 27
engagements. He was shot through
both lunge by a Mauser bill let, and
was also wounded in the shoulder
Recovering he continued to tight
until his hip was crushed under a
falling horse. He applied for
permission to return to America,
and was on his way to see Presi
dent Masso of the Cuban Republic
in regard to his farlough when he
was captured by Spanish scouts.
He had on his person a note from
Gomez to Messo, which if found
meant instant death. Realizing
this, he chewed and swallowed the
paper, and informed the scout 6
that he was just going to the Span-i
ish lines to surrender. He was
tried by court martial and all
chances seemed to be against him,
but he stuck to his story and was
finally set free on condition that he
leave Cuba and never return.
"Funston was then sent by Gen
eral Lee to New York and after be-'
ing in the hospital for a few
months returned to Kansas. There
he lectured on his experiences in
Cuba and was greatly successful.
On the breaking out of the war be
tween Spain and t America, he was
made Colonel of the 20th Kansas
Volunteers by Governor Leedy.
"He was first attached to the
staff of General Miles at Tampa
and bis advice based on his
knowledge gained in Cuba, proved
of great value in determining the
plan of American operations on the
island. Miles wanted him tore
main with him, but he wished to
be witli his own men, and went to
San Francisco. From there he
sailed with his regiment for Ma
nila. His brilliant work there is
well known.
" Funston now is only thirty
four year's old. While in college he
was a member of the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity. He was an inti
mate friend of William Allen
White, the well-known Kansas
magazine writer, author of "Boy
ville" sketches and editor of the
Emporia Gazette, and of the late
W. A. Snow, son of President
Snow of the University of Kan
sas."

companied by President Snow of
Kansas University, will arrive to

mous for its criminal trials, and
Funston knew how to handle them
well. Leaving the newspaper busi
ness, he became train collector for
the Santa Fe Railroad, with head
quarters at New Mexico. Notwith
standing all the stories to the con
trary, Funston was never a cowboy.
"He was then appointed special
agent of the division of botany of
the U. S. Department of Agricul
ture. His work consisted in mak
ing collections in dangerous places.
He was sc.it to Death Valley, Cali
fornia, and while there had a nar
row escape from death. He started
to go 150 miles for mail for the
party. His horse gave out for want
of water, and he himself became de
lirious from thirst. He finally
stumbled upon a hermit at the edge
of Death Valley, and was thus
saved. With one companion he
followed the main crest of the Sier
ras from Tehacippi Pass north to
Yosemite. He then went to Alaska
for six months, and did so well that
he was sent back again for a year
and a half. His second visit was
made famous for the trip which he
took on foot in the depth of winter
from the heart of Alaska to the
Arctic Ocean. He was accompa
nied b)' a few Indians, whom he
picked up here and there on the
way. He reached the Arctic,
tramped along the shore, and lived
with the Esquimaux. Hecanieacross
the San Francisco whaling fleet
at Herschell Island, and the men
welcomed him as if he had dropped
from the skies. After visiting the
men of the fleet for a week, he
tramped back, a thirty days' trip.
He heard there was an English mis
sionary in the country, and tramped
twelve days to see him. He didn't
like him, stayed one day, and
tramped back.
Funston then gave up his po
sition in the Department of Agri
culture, and went to the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec where he became
interested in coffee growing. He
came back to the United States
to organize a company and went to
New York, where he became the
friend of Theodore Roosevelt, who
recommended him to Harper's as
war correspondent. He made ar
rangements to go to Cuba and write
letters for Harper's' Weekly on the
Spanish-Cuban war. He gave this
up, however, to join ihe Insurgent
army, ha ving become convinced of
the justice of the Cuban cause. He
was made captain of artillery and
displayed remarkable aptitude for
handling men and guns. After the
death of Osgood, the famous Cor-

Nell and Pennsylvania football
player, who was major of artillery,
Funston was promoted. He was
promoted again to Lieutenant Colo
nel, and placed in command of all
the artillery of Gomez' army. He
was on the staff of General Gomez,
and became one of his most trusted
lieutenants. He remained two
years and a half in Cuba, and dur
ing that time participated in 27
engagements. He was shot through
both lunge by a Mauser bill let, and
was also wounded in the shoulder
Recovering he continued to tight
until his hip was crushed under a
falling horse. He applied for
permission to return to America,
and was on his way to see Presi
dent Masso of the Cuban Republic
in regard to his farlough when he
was captured by Spanish scouts.
He had on his person a note from
Gomez to Messo, which if found
meant instant death. Realizing
this, he chewed and swallowed the
paper, and informed the scout 6
that he was just going to the Span-i
ish lines to surrender. He was
tried by court martial and all
chances seemed to be against him,
but he stuck to his story and was
finally set free on condition that he
leave Cuba and never return.
"Funston was then sent by Gen
eral Lee to New York and after be-'
ing in the hospital for a few
months returned to Kansas. There
he lectured on his experiences in
Cuba and was greatly successful.
On the breaking out of the war be
tween Spain and t America, he was
made Colonel of the 20th Kansas
Volunteers by Governor Leedy.
"He was first attached to the
staff of General Miles at Tampa
and bis advice based on his
knowledge gained in Cuba, proved
of great value in determining the
plan of American operations on the
island. Miles wanted him tore
main with him, but he wished to
be witli his own men, and went to
San Francisco. From there he
sailed with his regiment for Ma
nila. His brilliant work there is
well known.
" Funston now is only thirty
four year's old. While in college he
was a member of the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity. He was an inti
mate friend of William Allen
White, the well-known Kansas
magazine writer, author of "Boy
ville" sketches and editor of the
Emporia Gazette, and of the late
