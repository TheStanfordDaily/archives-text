Tomorrow afternoon we svre to
have a distinguished visilor in
General Funston of the Kansas
Volunteers. Probably no man
has won such distinction in the war
in the East than has General Fun
ston, and being a college man and
a close friend of many Stanford
people, he should be given a hearty
reception when he comes. If the
weather permits General Funston
will deliver an address in the open
quadrangle, but otherwise he will
speak in the chapel. He will have
plenty of good things to say and all
who possibly can should turn out
to hear him. It would be well,
however, to remember the provis
ion that if the address is given in
the chapel students will be asked
to show their registration cards at
the door, the capacity of the chapel
not permitting an open attendance.
