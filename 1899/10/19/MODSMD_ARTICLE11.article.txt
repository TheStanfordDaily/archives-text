L'homjc who have had in charge
the arrangement of football songs
for this year have done well in
having these printed at this early
date. Formerly when we have at
tempted to sing some of our foot
ball songs at the rallies and pre
liminary games our attempts have
been failures because so few of the
students are familiar with the
songs. It has often been said that
not half of the students of the Uni
versity knew the college song "Hail
Stanford Hail" and this is prob
ably the reason why it is so seldom
heard at student gatherings. "Hush
the Hall Along'' is probably the
best known of any of the athletic
songs, but this is getting out of
date. The committee has spent
every effort in securing the best
possible songs and many new ones
will appear in the work just pub
lished. The students have the op
portunity of doing a great deal in
the line of encouragement to the
men who work upon the field if
they will follow the suggestion of
the committee in change of songs
and yells. Let every one learn

at least one of the most popular of
our college songs and then, when
the time comes, sing it. The ev
ening practices, as suggested by
the committee, will serve not only
as a means of learning the songs
for the regular student body rallies
but will stir up enthusiasm among
the students at large and make
these practices a sort of rally in
themselves. Nothing is better to
instil spirit in the men who are
striving for victory on the field
than a good rousing song sung by
a crowd of enthusiastic sympa
thizers. This makes the men feel
like playing, and if the students do
their part it is safe to say that the
men will do theirs.
