# The 						Glee Club.
## 
### 
Rehearsals of the Varsity Glee
are being held twice a week and
the club is rapidly rounding into
form. The parts are well sus
tained, particularly the first tenor
and second bass, which the new
men from the freshman class are
helping to make very strong. As
in previous years, the services of a
professional coach are to be
secured the organization. Upon
the recommendation of the leader
and several graduate club men,
Treasurer Lieter has engaged
Robert E. Newell, a professional
musician of Oakland, leader of the
Orpheus Club and other organiza
tions around the Bay, as instruc
tor. He is thoroughly qualified
for his work and will prove as suc
cessful as his predecessors, Profes
sors Pasinore and Morris. Newall
will be down to one of the rehear
sals each week. He was present
at the meeting last evening and
work on several new selections was
begun.
The Club now meets at 4:80 p.m.
Tuesdays and Thursdays and a
third weekly rehearsal will be
scheduled soon.
