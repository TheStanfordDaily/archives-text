# Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
The baseball team met for fall
practice this afternoon on the
faculty grounds. Capt. Strohn
put the men through a little light
work in fielding. On account of
the number of the baseball men
playing football, only twelve men
came out. Not much work will be
done until after thanksgiving.
