Tomorrow afternoon the Stan
ford eleven will again meet the
Olympic Club men on the football
field. Although the condition of
the men is much better than when
they met in the last match, at the
same time the club men have been
improving, both in condition and
practice, and a closely contested
game may be expected. Several
changes will be made in the make
up of both teams. No one will be
put in the game from Stanford
who is not in proper condition, and
hence our team may be somewhat
weaker than before. Those who
represent us in this g;nne can be
expected to play good ball and,
whether they win or lose, the match
will be well worth seing. At the
last game it was said by outsiders
that our "rooting" was weak. To
play good ball the men need en
couragement from the bleachers
and every student who can attend
tomorrow's game should join the
"rooters'" section and assist in the
yelling.
