The announcement that regis
tration cards must he presented for
admission to tieneral Funston's
lecture this afternoon was a pleas
ing one to the student body at
large. We do not begrudge to out
siders the plensure of hearing and
seeing our distinguished visitors,
but it is no more than fair that

tlie hosts should have the first op
portunity. It is to the students
that these addresses are made and
they are the ones in whom visitors
are interested. It has been note
worthy that a large part of chapel
audiences have been composed of
outsiders whose time enables them
jto obtain seats. Thus it has be
come almost a Stanford axiom
that lectures particularly interest-
I ing to students are almost impos
sible for them to attend. The
necessity for presentation of regis
tration cards will give us full pos
session of a pleasure which we have
always considered was somewhat
unfairly divided with outsiders.
The opening of the Assembly Hall
in the near future will make this
restriction unnecessary. Until
then, however, a continuation of
the registration card system for
lectures in the chapel, we feel, will
satisfy among the students a long
; felt want.
