Dr. Jordan spoke Wednesday at
San Jose on the preservation of the
fish and game of the Pacific Coast.
The meeting was under the auspices
of the Santa Clara County Fish and
Game Protection Association. Dr.
Jordan is in favor of more stringent
game laws, as without them some

kinds of game will soon he exter
minated. Market hunters were de
nounced. He said the trout streams
of California were the finest in the
world, but were being rapidly
thinned. The lecture was illus
trated by tine stereopticon views.
