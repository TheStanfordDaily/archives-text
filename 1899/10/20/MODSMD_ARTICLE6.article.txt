# PROF. ANDERSON'S LECTURE.
## The 						Study of Literature Considered as an Antidote for the Newspaper Habit. 
### 
The following is a brief digest of
Professor Anderson's lecture last
Tuesday evening :
As every human tendency has its
pathological aspect, it is impossible
that the widespread passion for
reading should escape the taint of
disease. One of the most degrad
ing forms of the modern mania for
reading is the newspaper habit.
The accomplishment of reading is
no longer a badge of intelligence.
The printing press and the tele
graph, which are of course necessi
ties of modern life and adjuncts of
civilization, are being constantly
prostituted to the most unworthy
ends. Trivial gossip acquires no
dignity from being included in the
dispatches of the Associated Press,
nor is the gossip of the world more
elevating to the mintl than the gos
sip of a village. It is- quite pos
sible for habitual newspaper readers
to remain perversely ignorant and
illiterate. Vet the ability to read
is often referred to as a panacea for
all the disabilities of the mind.
S'»nie people really seem to -think
the reading of the half-penny
' l Shocker," the Penny Dreadful,"
and the " yellow " journal tends to
cultivate a taste for good literature.
This is the view of optimists,—that
is, people who mistake their own
hopes and wishes for realities. The
truth is that nothing calls for more
wisdom and self-restraint than does
newspaper reading. If the reader
does not possess these qualities, the
School of the newspaper will do lit
tle to, cultivate them. So far is
newspaper reading from being of
disciplinary value, that it even
tends to relax the power of '"sus
tained attention in minds of some
cultivation. Mr. James Bryce re
marks that the careless habit of
mind fostered by the newspaper
reacts in the way in which books
are read. "Minds nurtured- on
newspapers are," he concludes," bad
soil on which to grow the finest
kinds of literary seed."
It would of course be quixotic to
start a crusade against nevvspapeis.
Newspapers are a prinpe public ne
cessity, for no knowledge is more
important than the information
they furnish concerning public
affairs. But in so far as they cater
to corrupt tastes, or are used by
unscrupulous'men in the service of
personal ambition, or are made
mere engines , for money getting,
they should be| discouraged and re
strained. Nothing is more import
ant than the formation of en
lightened and positive public senti
ment on this subject. Meanwhile
it is of little use to preach either to
newspaper-men themselves or to
the hardened newspaper reader.
It is now the duty of the teacher to
be firm in pointing out the danger,
and to make an earnest effort to
save or.reclaim the young.
An absorbing interest in some
one subject of study is certainly
the best preservative against the
debasing influence of newspapers.
The student who is possessed by
such an interest is in a position to
select wisely from the multifarious

items which distract the less pur
poseful mind. For students who
have not as yet discovered a special
liking or appetite, literary studies
are likely to be the best antidote
against the newspaper habit. And
even the enthusiastic specialist
runs a great risk, when at the
most impressionable age he turns
away from the studies which tend,
more than all others, to refine the
taste. By common consent the art
of literature does this at least as
effectively as any art, while it far
transcends the other arts in its
power to broaden the sympathies
and to liberalize the intelligence.
An enlightened taste for literature
especially for the highest form of
the art, poetry, not only rescues
the student from the newspaper
habit, but it gives him the power
<>112 right choice among the multi
tude of books that claim rank as
literature. For it is remarked that
after the student has climbed to
heights far above the level of the
newspaper, the problem of right
choice still confronts him—becomes
indeed more delicate and perplex
ing than ever.
The speaker dwelt at some length
upon the problem of the choice of
books purporting to be literary in
character, and then entered upon
a discussion of the nature and
functions of literary art. Bookfe of
literature were defined as those
which make appeal to the whole
nature of man, rather than tosome
special faculty or interest. Some
of the more suggestive definitions
of poetry were discussed, and 1 its
function of appealing to the sym
pathy through the imagination
was set forth. Finally the nature
of the ideal truth with which poetry
deals was illustrated by several ex
amples.
The philosophic mind of Fran
cis Bacon recognized in poetry "a
certain participation of divineness,
inasmuch as it doth raise and
erect the mind by submitting the
shows of things to the desires of
the mind." Bacon's pregnant
words were interpreted by Profes
sor Anderson as follows:
"Were poetry a mere sea of illu
sion into which we plunge to forget
our disappointments and solace our
griefs, )t would still be w r ell worth
cultivating. But it often has a
more distinctly religious function.
In its higher reaches, poetry res
cues us from weak submission to
those outward circumstances to
which we give the cowardly name
of' Fate.' It vindicates the dignity
of the human spirit. By giving us
a sense of permanence, it fills the
soul with solemn elation."
