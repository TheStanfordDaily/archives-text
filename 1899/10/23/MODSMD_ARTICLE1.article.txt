# SATURDAY'S GAME.
## Olympic and Stanford Tie for the Second Time, Making Olympic's Third Zero Score. 
### 
The varsity played a tie game
with the Olympic Club team on the
Sixteenth street grounds, neither
side scoring. The grounds were
muddy and there was no brilliant
playing. The club men were much
heavier than the varsity and forced
the ball down the lield by line
bucks. The Olympic hacks fum
bled the ball time after time and
this together with the varsity's
stand on our ten-yard line kept the
club men from scoring.
Murphy did not try end runs
but punted high, relying on his
ends to keep the ball in Olympic
territory. McFadden at left end
played the best game for Stanford.
In the second half the varsity got
within twenty yards of the Olym
pic line and Murphy tried for a
field goal. The varsity had the
ball at the end of each half.
The Olympic had a strong line
up. Fickert and Cadwallader
played the guards and strengthen
ed the club line. Dinsmore, the
Olympic half, made the longest
run of the day, bringing one of
Murphy's punts in eighteen yards.
Following is the line-up of the
two teams:
Stanford. OLYMPIC.

The game must be thrown out
in casting form on the relative de
velopment of the varsity with the
Berkeley team The Olympic team
had the advantage in weight and
were greatly aided by the soft,
slushy lield. In the first half the
varsity had a slight advantage
over their heavier opponents, but
in the second half the club men
easily outplayed our team: keeping
the ball on our territory most of
the time. .Just before time was
called they were prevented from
scoring only by a sharp rally on
the part of the Varsity. Although
the game was streaky, the Varsity
showed a marked improvement in
team work and style of play over
anything they have put up this
season. The men hunt; together
in interference and put snap into
their tackling. At times, however,
they let down in their work and
their game became exceedingly
loose and ragged. When they were
together and playing at their best
they g;i ve a superior exhibition of
ball, nothing approaching Thanks

giving form, but something to base
hope upon.
In the line MacFailtlen, Graves,
and Burnett outclassed the rest of
the team. Mac's game at end was
fast and aggressive. lie was in
every play and made hut two slips,
once he was pulled off-side and
another time he was drawn in on a
run around his end. Graves played
against Fickert, '98, and put up a
steady game. lie is game and likes
to fight. Hayden's passing was a
bit erratic, hut considering the
slippery hall and the condition of
the lield, his work is worthy of
mention. Erskine had an easy
lime with Dole. 'Babe" Burnett
played a good game, hut not up to
his old-time form. Once in a while
he would get up on his toes and
play like his former self.
Bentley tried hard and was in
the play hard and strong. He
made several good stops of masses
on his tackle. Parker played a
good game at end, and although he
did not miss his man, he otten
allowed the runner to gain his
distance. He was down under
kicks well.
Behind the line llodolph, Fisher,
and Smith did good work. Their
defensive game was hard and clean
cut. They tackled hard and filled
up holes in the line well. Murphy
was up to his usual form. His
handling and punting of the wet
ball wasof a high order in compari
son with the work of the Olympic
quarter and full back. He tried
for field goals twice and failed by
a wide margin each time.
The score of nothing to nothing
indicates a lack of tight on the part
of both teams. All the men seem
to be satisfied if the opposing side
did not score. The chief fault with
the varsity in Saturday's game
was that they seemed satisfied when
they were doing well enough. They
merely kept up with the pace set
lÂ»y the Olympic team. Only once
in the game, at the end of the first
half, were they the leaders.
