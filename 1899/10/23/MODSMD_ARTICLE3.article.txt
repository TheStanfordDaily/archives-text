# FUNSTON'S LECTURE.
## The 						General Gives His Ideas of What Should Bo Our Policy in the Philippines. 
### 
A hero is not one bit less attrac
tive now than in a more romantic
age, judging from the reception
Stanford students gave General
Funston at the chapel Friday after
noon. The address was set for
3:30, the doors to be open at 3.
Long before that time a crowd had
gathered on the outside and five
minutes after the door opened not
a vacant seat was to be had. A
few moments later the party escort
ing the general arrived. His ap
pearance was the sign for tumul
tuous cheering. A yelling section
gave the Kansas University yell
in Funston's honor,followed by the
Stanford yell. Dr. Jordan intro
duced the speaker.
General Funston thanked the
audience for his reception, which
he said was warmer than he had
expected, and hoped that they
would not be disappointed, for, as
he had prepared no lecture, he in
tended to speak only fifteen or
twenty minutes on the causes of
the war and the problems that
would confront the United States
at its close.
"We thought a year ago," con
tinued the speaker, "that we should
only have trouble for a few months
and that soldiers going to Manila
were only in for garrison duty and
perhaps a little lighting. But the
people in the United States knew
little about it. In the minds of the
soldiers already in the Bhilippines,
however, a totally different idea
prevailed. What they saw was
about 15,000 troops in the city,
with on'y outposts outside. Our
soldiers were under strict orders to
be careful and not bring about
quarrels with the insurgents, and
were forced to stand so much ag
gravation at their hands that the
enemy became convinced that our
soldiers were cowards. But'on Feb
ruary 4th lighting finally com
menced. An insurgent lieutenant
attempted to place a sentry post
inside the Nebraska line. A Ne
braska sentinel in the performance
of his duty shot and killed the
lieutenant. Within a few hours
twenty miles of insurgent front
opened on the Americans.
"As to the causes of the war:
There is little use discussing
whether Dewev and the American
consuls promised the insurgents
independence. Dewey says he did
not and 1 would take his word
before that of an army of Filipi
nos. What the insurgents tried to
do was to force the American
troops front the islands before rein
forcements arrived. The Filipino
leaders are politicians, inspired
primarily with a desire for spoils
and office. It has never .been a
war of the entire Filipino people,
because there are a great many
different races and religions on the
islands, that could never harmon
ize. The insurgents are princi
pally from the southern portion of
Luzon.
' I he people are a queer mix
ture of intelligence and barbarian
ism. Some are highly educated
but the majority are ignorant. At

the head of the insurrection are
; ambitious young men like Aguin
aldo and Montenegro It may be
truthfully said that none of the
solid business men of Manila are
interested with the insurgents.
They do not actively aid us he
cause of a fear that we may relin
quish the islands, when vengeance
would he visited upon them.
"Speaking of keeping the islands
brings us to a consideration of that
subject. We of the United States
are not extreme expansionists; we
do not care to meander all over the
globe picking up every loose island
or state that may chance in our
power. But considering the man
ner in which the Philippines be
came ours, as a direct result of a
war forced upon us; considering
our loss of men and expenditure of
money, we should certainly retain
the islands, and give the people a
good government. The descen
dants of the people now alive will
thank us.
"1 have said that a few Filipi
nos are well educated. But they
have crude ideas of government, as
to how they would control the
various religions, and keep the
many tribes of nations from fight
ing among themselves. The chief
difficulty in the Philippines is that
they do not form a homogeneous
nation. There are twenty lang
uages spoken with six fundamental
nationalities. There is little in
common between these peoples.
As for the argument that we are
crowding out the rightful owners,
the insurgents themselves are only
usurpers, having driven the origi
nal owners, the little woolly headed
Lugretos, up into the fastnesses of
the mountains."
General Funston paid a high
tribute to the soldiers in Manila.
He said that some things did not *
always seem to him just right but
it was not his place, as a subordi
nate. to criticise.
"As toself government, I think
the Filipinos should he given the
least minimum say. A legislature
could be organized, making them
think they wielded great power,
but in reality only a little. But
above all things it is important
that the first governor-general
should be a courageous man, a man
without a price, with the firmness
and honesty of a soldier, and the
sagacity of a statesman, such a
man as Professor Wooster, General
Wood, or Governor Roosevelt.
''The Filipinos are not as good
or as bad as painted. Bur they
are great liars, though that is not
surprising after thre<i hundred
years of Spanish rule. Jf we give
them a good government, schools,
railroads, improved harbors, op
portunity to work, equitable taxes,
the next generation will see the
people loyal to the United States.
But lirst we must get rid of every
vestige of Spanish language, laws,
and customs. Make them Amer
icans."
The speaker denied the stories of
cruelty to the Filipinos as told by
returne I army skulkers, and term
ed them unmitigated liars. There
are in every army a certain number
of these individuals, who are sel
dom on the firing line, but fre-
quently in the hospital; they do i
the seditious talking. The General
said he had been in eighteen en
gagements and had never seen or
even heard of the reported atroci
ties, except through the medium of
the American press. The speaker
termed the war the most merciful
ever prosecuted, lie said an Italian
attache told him that he never
realized that war could he carried
on by a civilized nation against
barbarians with so much mercy.
General Funston said there had
not been a single execution of in
surgent spies, even when they were
pledged to support the United
States. ''If anything," he said, "we
have erred on the side of sentiment
by not executing."
In concluding his remarks the
speaker called attention to the great
value of the islands; their 112,000
square miles of soil, 95 per cent of
which was capable of cultivation,
and the most fertile on the face of
the globe; their hard wood forests
and deposits of gold, iron, and
sulphur; their plantations of hemp,
sugar, and coffee. ' The islands, in
stead of being an expense, will
soon become a source of great
revenue. Hut we must put in a first
class man as Governor-General."
'"The new campaign," continued
the General, "will see instead of
20,000 troops, forty or fifty thous
and properly equipped. I can
confidently predict that when the
campaign starts atiain, four or five
months will see the complete col
lapse of the insurrection Then
comes the more serious problem.
We a;e not familiar with the best
methods of governing a strange
people. The British have to deal
with such things through their
history. We know little of the
Filipinos or their internal organi
zation. The first trouble will he
with the friars. If we could cut
them out of the islands, it would
save a great deal of future trouble.
1 do not mean to slur them person
ally or their religion, but they
have obtained control of a great
deal of property and are a
constant source of aggravation to
the natives.

deal of property and are a
constant source of aggravation to
the natives.
A hero is not one bit less attrac
tive now than in a more romantic
age, judging from the reception
Stanford students gave General
Funston at the chapel Friday after
noon. The address was set for
3:30, the doors to be open at 3.
Long before that time a crowd had
gathered on the outside and five
minutes after the door opened not
a vacant seat was to be had. A
few moments later the party escort
ing the general arrived. His ap
pearance was the sign for tumul
tuous cheering. A yelling section
gave the Kansas University yell
in Funston's honor,followed by the
Stanford yell. Dr. Jordan intro
duced the speaker.
General Funston thanked the
audience for his reception, which
he said was warmer than he had
expected, and hoped that they
would not be disappointed, for, as
he had prepared no lecture, he in
tended to speak only fifteen or
twenty minutes on the causes of
the war and the problems that
would confront the United States
at its close.
"We thought a year ago," con
tinued the speaker, "that we should
only have trouble for a few months
and that soldiers going to Manila
were only in for garrison duty and
perhaps a little lighting. But the
people in the United States knew
little about it. In the minds of the
soldiers already in the Bhilippines,
however, a totally different idea
prevailed. What they saw was
about 15,000 troops in the city,
with on'y outposts outside. Our
soldiers were under strict orders to
be careful and not bring about
quarrels with the insurgents, and
were forced to stand so much ag
gravation at their hands that the
enemy became convinced that our
soldiers were cowards. But'on Feb
ruary 4th lighting finally com
menced. An insurgent lieutenant
attempted to place a sentry post
inside the Nebraska line. A Ne
braska sentinel in the performance
of his duty shot and killed the
lieutenant. Within a few hours
twenty miles of insurgent front
opened on the Americans.
"As to the causes of the war:
There is little use discussing
whether Dewev and the American
consuls promised the insurgents
independence. Dewey says he did
not and 1 would take his word
before that of an army of Filipi
nos. What the insurgents tried to
do was to force the American
troops front the islands before rein
forcements arrived. The Filipino
leaders are politicians, inspired
primarily with a desire for spoils
and office. It has never .been a
war of the entire Filipino people,
because there are a great many
different races and religions on the
islands, that could never harmon
ize. The insurgents are princi
pally from the southern portion of
Luzon.
' I he people are a queer mix
ture of intelligence and barbarian
ism. Some are highly educated
but the majority are ignorant. At

the head of the insurrection are
; ambitious young men like Aguin
aldo and Montenegro It may be
truthfully said that none of the
solid business men of Manila are
interested with the insurgents.
They do not actively aid us he
cause of a fear that we may relin
quish the islands, when vengeance
would he visited upon them.
"Speaking of keeping the islands
brings us to a consideration of that
subject. We of the United States
are not extreme expansionists; we
do not care to meander all over the
globe picking up every loose island
or state that may chance in our
power. But considering the man
ner in which the Philippines be
came ours, as a direct result of a
war forced upon us; considering
our loss of men and expenditure of
money, we should certainly retain
the islands, and give the people a
good government. The descen
dants of the people now alive will
thank us.
"1 have said that a few Filipi
nos are well educated. But they
have crude ideas of government, as
to how they would control the
various religions, and keep the
many tribes of nations from fight
ing among themselves. The chief
difficulty in the Philippines is that
they do not form a homogeneous
nation. There are twenty lang
uages spoken with six fundamental
nationalities. There is little in
common between these peoples.
As for the argument that we are
crowding out the rightful owners,
the insurgents themselves are only
usurpers, having driven the origi
nal owners, the little woolly headed
Lugretos, up into the fastnesses of
the mountains."
General Funston paid a high
tribute to the soldiers in Manila.
He said that some things did not *
always seem to him just right but
it was not his place, as a subordi
nate. to criticise.
"As toself government, I think
the Filipinos should he given the
least minimum say. A legislature
could be organized, making them
think they wielded great power,
but in reality only a little. But
above all things it is important
that the first governor-general
should be a courageous man, a man
without a price, with the firmness
and honesty of a soldier, and the
sagacity of a statesman, such a
man as Professor Wooster, General
Wood, or Governor Roosevelt.
''The Filipinos are not as good
or as bad as painted. Bur they
are great liars, though that is not
surprising after thre<i hundred
years of Spanish rule. Jf we give
them a good government, schools,
railroads, improved harbors, op
portunity to work, equitable taxes,
the next generation will see the
people loyal to the United States.
But lirst we must get rid of every
vestige of Spanish language, laws,
and customs. Make them Amer
icans."
The speaker denied the stories of
cruelty to the Filipinos as told by
returne I army skulkers, and term
ed them unmitigated liars. There
are in every army a certain number
of these individuals, who are sel
dom on the firing line, but fre-
quently in the hospital; they do i
the seditious talking. The General
said he had been in eighteen en
gagements and had never seen or
even heard of the reported atroci
ties, except through the medium of
the American press. The speaker
termed the war the most merciful
ever prosecuted, lie said an Italian
attache told him that he never
realized that war could he carried
on by a civilized nation against
barbarians with so much mercy.
General Funston said there had
not been a single execution of in
surgent spies, even when they were
pledged to support the United
States. ''If anything," he said, "we
have erred on the side of sentiment
by not executing."
In concluding his remarks the
speaker called attention to the great
value of the islands; their 112,000
square miles of soil, 95 per cent of
which was capable of cultivation,
and the most fertile on the face of
the globe; their hard wood forests
and deposits of gold, iron, and
sulphur; their plantations of hemp,
sugar, and coffee. ' The islands, in
stead of being an expense, will
soon become a source of great
revenue. Hut we must put in a first
class man as Governor-General."
'"The new campaign," continued
the General, "will see instead of
20,000 troops, forty or fifty thous
and properly equipped. I can
confidently predict that when the
campaign starts atiain, four or five
months will see the complete col
lapse of the insurrection Then
comes the more serious problem.
We a;e not familiar with the best
methods of governing a strange
people. The British have to deal
with such things through their
history. We know little of the
Filipinos or their internal organi
zation. The first trouble will he
with the friars. If we could cut
them out of the islands, it would
save a great deal of future trouble.
