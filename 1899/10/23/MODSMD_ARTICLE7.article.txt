While it is early in the season
for predictions, we have reason to
feel satisfied with the work of the
football team last Saturday. The
game was played under conditions
most advantageous to the heavy
Olympic team. Our light backs
could not start in the mud, while
the heavy Olympic line ploughed
through both tackles for gains at
almost every down. The team
seemed weak in offensive work and
showed a lack of ability to advance
the ball except on kicks. Berkeley
played the same team under con
ditions more advantageous to her,
and, as in yesterday's game, both
teams came near scoring. On the
whole, as we said before, we should
feel encouraged.
