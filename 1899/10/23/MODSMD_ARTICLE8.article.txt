# For a National University.

It has been urged that a national
university at Washington would he
corrupted by personal schemes and
partisan politics, just as colonial |
service and Alaskan service have
been corrupted at times and as the-1

army has been corrupted recently.
The conditions are not the same.
Our navy never has been corrupted
by politics, simply because it de
mands expert knowledge and be
cause the nephews of Congressmen
cannot run big ships. Our naval
service is the best in the world, it
has been most sensibly and scien
tifically managed.
" Here, then, are three great ar
guments for a national university
That it would utilize tremendous
resources stored up in the museums
and libraries of Washington ; that
it would furnish material for the
study of democracy; and that it
would make democracy better worth
studying. All these things would
surely result from the establish
ment of a national university which
would lie a national university in
the highest sense." —President Jor
dan at the N. E. A.
