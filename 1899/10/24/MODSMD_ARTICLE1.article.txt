# ON THE OVAL.
## Teams Line Up for Practice Inside the Cinder Track. 
### 
Owing to the poor condition of |
the tield the men were lined up on
the track oval for practice. A
freshman team was put against the
Varsity eleven, and an effort was
made to try out the new men for
next Saturday's game. The unus
ually large number of candidates
this year makes the selection of the
team a difficult task. For every
position there are at least three
candidates, and the competition for
places is close.
For center Lee and John are the
principal candidates. Lee is heavy
and follows the ball well, but
he is not aggressive enough, and
becomes tired too easy. John is
smaller than his opponent, but is
strong, fast, and aggresive. He fol-!
lows the ball well and passes ac
curately.
Barnhisel and Treager seem to
have the guard positions pretty
well cinched. Both are hard play
ers, especially in defensive work.
Treager is one of the fastest men on
the field and gets down on kicks
well. Barkin, who played in the
center of the line for some time, is
out of tlie game with an injured
shoulder.
The team will probably be
strongest in the tackle positions,
McFadden, Hauverman and Crow
ell have shown up best so far.
McFadden is fast and hard to
block. Hauverman is strong and
plays low in the line, and in this
has an advantage over Crowell,
who goes too high.
The weakest places in the whole
team are the end positions. There
are plenty of candidates for these
places, but few have been given a
chance to show what they can do
(.Jeer and Caglieri, who are now
playing the ends, aie unreliable
and unsatisfactory as has been
shown in every game they have
played. Davis, who showed up so
well in the Tamalpais and Santa
Clara games, is probably the best
of those who have played. Luck,
who has had considerable experi
ence al the game before coming to
the University, is a reliable man
and would strengthen the end posi
tion. Nourse played a strong game
against the Tamalpais team. He
has plenty of speed and is a sure
tackier. CJowden played well while
he was out, but is now off on
account of injuries.
For quarter, Raitt and Bollard
are the principal candidates.
Bollard gives his signals better and
is surer on the pass than Raitt,
but otherwise the latter has the
advantage. He runs the interfer
ence in good shape, and for all
round playing, is probably the best
man in the Held. Ackernym passes
well and is strong in backing up
the line.
The team will be strong in the
half positions. Smith, Naramore,
Knight. Luck, and Campbell are
the principal candidates. Smith
and Naramore have the advan
tage of last Saturday's game, and
have had considerable coaching in
the Varsity practices. Knight runs
well with the ball, but does nothing
to help out the interference. Allen

showed up well at the first of the
season, but has heen laid off with a
broken collar bone.
For full Parker and Roberts are
playing about even. Both are good
line buckers, and know the game.
Their punting is accurate and well
placed. Both men will probably
be seen in Saturday's game, and
will surely give a good account of
themselves.
The teams as lined up in yester
day's practice are as follows:
Varsity. Freshmen.
