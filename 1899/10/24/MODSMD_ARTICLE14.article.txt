With only five days to the an
nual intercollegiate Freshman con
test it seems that we are in a less
hopeful mood than at the begin
ning of the season. Then we shook
our heads dubiously when the
Varsity was under discussion, but
were jubilant over Freshman pros
pects. Now the propositions are
changed. "Why? There must be
a reason!" And there certainly is
a reason; the inability to handle
our material which has brought
about a confusion and a lack of
team work; almost a lack of team.
There are a number of men who
are almost fixtures on the team
and who are inferior to others on
the field who have had
but little chance to play.
And if it is urged that the team is
not yet selected there is all the more
blame, since it should have been
selected before this, and should
have been practicing as a whole. A
Freshman victory is of great im
portance especially ibis year, as the
initial chance for a victory after a
string of rankling defeats. There
has been, too, a direct connection —
perhaps accidental—between the

Freshman and Varsity scores.
When U. C. beat us 44-0 in the
Freshman game, it was followed by
a Thanksgiving tie —a Berkeley
victory; but 14-4 precedes 20-0,
and 16-8 was followed by 28-0.
Then last year 21-0 against us was
followed by our first Thanksgiving
defeat. These are more than mere
coincidences.
