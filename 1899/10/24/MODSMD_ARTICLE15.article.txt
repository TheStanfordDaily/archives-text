Th ' time has come for the an
nual —or perennial —lecture to the
freshmen. Every class gets it and
every one needs it—some more than
others. There are always a num
ber of "queers" in each incoming
class; to this statement there are no
exceptions. Let any one go back
over the infant years of any class
and he can recall the various freaks
that have been thrust, or have
thrust themselves, on the college
gaze. We often wonder what species
of infatuation prompts certain in
dividuals to assume attitudes as
grotesque and absurd as those
adopted by several notorious fresh
ies. The main desire of the Uni
versity at large is that the fresh
men as a body will begin to realize
their imbecility and try to remedy
it. In college parlance, it is hoped
they will "get on to themselves.''
Other classes than '03 have made
themselves ridiculous, and '02 was
not the least of them; but the pres
ent freshmen are about the limit.
The business of making a constitu
tion that is a laughing stock, and
now proposing to make it all over
again; of adopting a class yell that
is even more a matter of ridicule,
until now an unauthorized com
mittee fills these columns with a
yell that is as mediocre as the other
was outre. These are the least of
the things. Of the informal dance
"for freshmen only" we have to
say that the idea is good enough,
but they have gone about having
their exclusiveness in the wrong
way. Former classes, too, have
gone into debt on only one dance,
where the attendance was not lim
ited; perhaps '03 can make their
two pay, but we doubt it. And the
new steering committee to oversee
the president; it passes comment,
but it passes a hard comment on
the president. They need, as we
said before, to find their place and
keep it with quietness. "Children
should be seen," etc. Let them
keep their affairs to themselves and
not bring forward what sounds to
intelligent ears like the foolish
babblings of a kindergarten.
