# FRESHMAN AND VARSITY.
## The 						First Year Eleven Rounding Into Shape for Saturday's Game. 
### 
The Freshmen were again lined
up against the Varsity last night
on the track oval. The line-up
was practically the same as that
of the night before and is a pretty
good indication of what can be ex
pected next Saturday. For the
Freshmen the best work was done
by Parker, McFadden, and Raitt.
Luck and Davis were placed at the
ends and showed up well. Both
are fast in setting down on kicks
and are hard, sure tacklers. They
are both light but show plenty of
grit and ginger. McFadden did
some of the best tackling that has
been seen this year; he tackled all
over the field and brought Murphy
down once after he had passed
everyone else. Haiti still plays
the consistent game of which he
has shown himself capable in the
early practices. For the Varsity
the best work was done by Murphy
and Fisher.
Following is the line-up:
