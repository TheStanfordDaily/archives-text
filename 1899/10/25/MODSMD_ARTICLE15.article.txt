# Memorial Windows.
## 
### 
The three memorial windows be
ing placed in the new Library build
ing are the work of Joseph Lamb
of New York. The windows form
a rich setting for the south side of
the upper corridors. The windows
are alike in size and shape, but of
different design. On the left is
Thomas a Kempis, 011 the right
Moses, and in the center Raphael's
Christ.
The small pieces of glass forming
each window are all hand-painted,
and each piece is a study in light
effect. The one window now fin
ished —the Christ —is perfect. The
face is fairly illumined by the sun,
and a halo of light surrounds the
head. Lamb says this work is the
masterpiece of his art.
