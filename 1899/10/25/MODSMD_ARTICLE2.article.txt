Since the hint meeting of llie
Training House Committee the
members met at the call of Chair
man Hoover to look over various
sites for the permanent athletic
lield. This is the fundamental ne
cessity before a site for a training
house is selected, and the committee
is working with a view, first of
ascertaining whether there is a
definite location assigned to the
student's athletic field in the Uni
versity plans, and second, if there
is not, to suggest one which should
he designated as the permanent
athletic (ield which would answer
all the requirements forsucha field
—general accessibility, proper
drainage, and shelter from the
wind. As soon as the committee
can communicate with Mrs. Stan
ford and definite data are at hand
the whole matter will be referred
to the student body.
As soon as the site of the
permanent athletic field can be
determined the location of the
training house can lie settled with
reference to the former, and then
the committee can devote all its
energy to raising funds. When the
house is erected the work of chang
ing the athletic field will be a com
paratively easy undertaking.
The secretary of the committee,
Henry II Taylor, was instructed
to correspond with Eastern athletic
authorities to secure, if possible,
plans of the athletic fields of lead
ing Eastern universities which will
he used in working out, the prob
lems on the Stanford campus.

As one method of raising funds

with Herbert A. Kidder, manager
of the Capital Concert Co., and if
satisfactory arrangements can be
made, a concert by the leading mu
sicians of which the company is
composed will be given on the
campus in the near future.
