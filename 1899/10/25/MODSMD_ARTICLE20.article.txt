An endeavor is being made to
bring to the campus for one even
ing in November, Kather ne E.
Oliver, who holds the international
reputation of being the foremost
impersonator of this generation.
She is making a hurried mid-sea
son visit to the Pacific Coast, visit
ing only l he cities of San Francisco,
Oakland, and Portland, Ore. If a
sufficient guarantee can be secured
today she will be booked in the
chapel for about Nov. 18, under the
auspices of some leading college or
ganization. Miss Oliver's specialty
is Scottish character, and she has
a repertoire of some twelve plays
dramatized by herself from such
novels as "The Play Actress," ''The
Little Minister,'' etc. She is under
the management of Major J. B.
Pond (Mark Twain's manager),
and last season appeared under the
patronage of such people as Edward
Everett Hale and Julia Ward Howe
in Boston, President and Mrs. Mc-
Kinley in Washington, the Earl
and Countess of Aberdeen in Ot
tawa, Canada.
