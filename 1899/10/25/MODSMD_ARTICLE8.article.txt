# NATURE AND CULTURE.
## A Synopsis of Professor Ward's Lecture in the Chapel Last Night.
### 
A large audience greeted I'rof.
Lester F. Ward, the new lecturer
in Sociology, on the occasion of his
appearance last nigh t in the chapel,
lie took for his thesis the follow
ing;,
"1 lie persons who have achieved
success in the world have done so
by virtue of the inherent qualities
in their nature rather than by
virtue of outside circumstance,"
and he discussed the antithesis of
this, that "success has been
achieved by virtue of outside cir
cumstances rather than on account
of inherent qualities in the indi
vidual." lie styled the thesis a
fallacy, sounding true, as an un
truth accepted by the world, and
stated that his antithesis was
nearer the real truth. He took
issue with the popular conception
that heredity is everything and
environment nothing, and stood
for the proposition that nurture is
of more importance than nature.
He styled the arguments in favor
of heredity as the vital force of fal
lacies and sophistries. He discussed
the proposition as to what extent
tiie native powers of a man are
hindered or repressed by adverse
circumstances, and pointed out the
following: "That the hereditar
ians say that 'blood will tell,' yet
it is commonly known that a
major part of the talented and
successful persons are from the
rurul districts and the lower classes.
"There is no such difference in
men as is generally supposed, and
I believe that 'all men are created
equal' in a wider sense than set
forth by the Declaration of Inde
pendence. There are the same in
herent qualities of talent alike in
rich and poor, city and country.
But outward circumstances of ad
versity keep talent down, and the
competition of man against man
makes success comparatively rare,
though merit exists. And thus
merit does not come to the surface.
"The really self-made men, if
there are any such, are erratic and
angular, and are generally forgot
ten by their descendants. All who
have won success have possessed
opportunities, and a lack of oppor
tunity has deprived the world of
many great men.
"The present state of society does
not receive the best results and the
struggle for existence does not nec
essarily result in the survival of
the fittest. This is as true of ani
mal and vegetable life as it is of
human society. For example, take
the cultivated flowers which have
been protected by man and kept
free from the strenuous competition
of other forms. They have had the
opportunity to develop without
natural adversity and have come
near to their full development.
And it is as true with society.
"In conclusion," t he speaker said,
"the question resolves itself into
this: Can society protect itself from
itself â€”from hurttul competition ?
I maintain that it can."
