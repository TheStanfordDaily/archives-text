A. ({. Maddren, ex-'OO, and W.
11. Osgood, "J9, returned to the

University last Thursday from a
collecting expedition in the inter
ior of Alaska.
They left the University May
20th, being sent out by the Smith
sonian Institution of Washington,
1). C., with which Osgood is con
nected. The interior of Alaska
was reached by way of White's
Pass. Some time was spent in
Dawson City and the gold fields
and then they pushed on further
into the interior.
They succeeded in securing about
1000 bird skins and over 100 mam
mals, among them being many
rare and valuable specimens, nota
bly one of the little blue bear, of
which there exists no specimen in
any museum. There was also a
variety of ground squirrels of an
entirely new species, the skins of
whice they lost through accident.
The larger part of the collection
was shipped home by way of Cir
cle City, but several cases of the
smaller and more valuable speci
mens were carried with them. On
the return trip, descending the
Yukon in an open boat, they were
upset in the rapids and everything
was lost except a small case
of specimens. They succeeded in
reaching an island, where they
built a raft by burning down trees
and tying them together with strips
of clothing. They finally found
their boat below the rapids and
floated down the river, having
nothing to eat for several days.
Finally a woodchoppers' camp was
reached. Here the Esquimaux
dogs of the camp devoured the
valuable ground sqirrel specimens
as they were drying in the sun.
They were forced to continue their
journey as the woodchopper had
not sufficient food for them, and
the arsenic in the skins was begin
ning to affect the dogs. For three
days they drifted down the Yukon
with nothing to eat but a little
flour and water. Finally they
were picked up by a passing
steamer and landed at St.Michaels.
Here they took passage on the
Revenue Cutter Corwin for Seattle.
At Cape Nome where the steamer
stopped on the trip down, there are
10,000 miners with only provisions
sufficient for 3,000. The lieuten
ant in charge of the government
fort there has determined if the
worst comes to collect the provi
sions which, with the government
stores, will be sufficient for 5,000
people for nine months if the min
ers are put on strict daily rations.
At the Pribilof Islands the Cor
win took on board the passengers
and crew of the wrecked steamer
Laurada which sprang a leak dur
ing the trip from Dutch Harbor
and was run ashore on St. George
Island.
Maddren and Osgood reached
San Francisco Wednesday and
came down to the University the
next night. Their collection will
besenton to the National Museum
