# FRESHMAN FOOTBALL NOTES.
## Schedule of Freshman Games Played This Season. 
### 
The Freshmen w« re again lined
up against the Varsity mid scored
against them, though the Varsity
gave them tin- ball l»>r several
downs after holding them. Mc-
Fadden, '03 tackle, was given the
ball, and went through the Varsity
left tackle for gains. Naiamore
bucks too high and should go
lower. The Freshmen |>ut up a
good game and played together.
At the end of the last half Parker
caught the ball on a punt and ran
it in past the ends for a good gain.
Both Parker and Roberts handle
punts well.
Last night at signal practice
Smith and Parker were played at
half and Roberts was put in at full.
Following is last night's line-up:

Following is a schedule of games
played by the Stanford and Cali
fornia Freshmen this season:
Stanford 0, St. Matthews 0
Stanford 11, Mt. TamalpaisO
Stanford 12, Univ. of Pacific 0
Stanford lt>, Palo Alto 5
Stanford 0, Santa Clara 12
Stanford 0, Belmont 0
California 0, Lowell 5
California 0, Santa Clara 0
California (5, Alameda Lt.Wt. 11
California 10, Berkeley High 0
California 8, St. Matthews 0
California 0, Belmont 0
From this schedule it is seen
that our Freshmen have been twice
scored against, and defeated once.
The Palo Alto High School scored
on the Freshmen second eleven.
Berkeley played a tie game with
the Santa Clara team which de
feated Stanford by a score of 12-0.
Both Freshman teams played
nothing-to-nothing games with
Belmont. Stanford played a tie
game with St. Matthews, neither
side scoring, while Berkeley de
feated the same team by a score of
8-0. From the record of games
played, the Berkeley Freshmen
show up better than the Stanford
team. Our team, however, has im
proved greatly since the academic
games, having had more signal
practice and more work together as
a team.
Although the team has not yet
been fully decided upon the candi
dates have been sifted down pretty
well so that few changes from
yesterday's line-up need be ex
pected. Lee and John are having
a close light for the center positions
with chances in favor of the latter.
Traeger and Barnhisel are proba
bly fixtures in the guard positions,
wlii'e for tackle McFadden, Crow
ell, and Hauverrnan are fighting it
out. McFadden shows up the best

of the three, especially in the offen
sive. His work last night in run
ning with the hall marks him as a
man who will bear watching. The
end positions are still in doubt.
Luck and Davis have the advan
tage of speed and grit. (Jeer is
plenty heavy enough but is slow in
getting down the field. Caglieri
has good speed but is usually
found running in the wrong direc
tion. lie spends too much of his
time in assisting the coaches and
not enough in watching the ball.
Back of the line are Raitt and
Pollard for quarters and Parker,
Roberts, Smith, and Naramore for
the other positions. Parker and
Roberts are the best of the quartet
and one of them will probably go
at half along with Smith. Smith's
experience in the Varsity practice
will be of good service to him, but
he is still weak on the defensive.
Taking the team as a whole the
outlook is much brighter than it
was a week ago. The men play
well together and the keen compe
tition for places on the team has
served to put ginger into every
one. If the same spirit is main
tained among the men a strong
team will result.
