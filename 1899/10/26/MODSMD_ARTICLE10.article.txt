It is unfortunate that the Fresh
man Class has been put in so poor
a light before the college public by
the actions of some of its members.
The freshmen, as a class, we are
proud of and have unbounded faith
in. And there are plenty of times
when they want to be very much
in evidence, as at the intercollegiate
game in the city next Saturday.
On that occasion the class wants to
be extremely well filled with an at
titude of faith in the prowess of a
team that is as good as any that
has represented Stanford in a fresh
man contest. The whole Univer
sity, especially the members of the
student body who have seen former
freshman games won and lost, have
unbounded faith in the colts of this
year, and in bringing home a vic
tory they will but live up to what
has been promised by consistent
and praiseworthy effort on the part
of every freshman who has been
appearing on the Held. There are
a number —a large number—of
men who will not make the team,
because only eleven men go on the
field, but tin se who have lent their
aid and enthusiasm may know
their efforts have not been in vain,
for to them conies the consciousness
of having served well and faith
fully; their reward will be in the
knowledge of their effort and in the
knowledge that the men who cheer
the team to victory do not forget
the days of preparation.
