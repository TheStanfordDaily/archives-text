We thought, the freshmen had
reached the limit of effrontery, and
paid so without equivocation in
this column a few days ago. But
since then the University has seen
the '03 class numerals painted on
the quad near the entrance to the
new chapel. The figures are not as
hirge as they might be, nor its dis
tinct —this latter due to a bad
choice in location, where the paint
brush had to contend against the
counter influences of moisture and

a gravelly surface. But even fresh-1
men should have been able to see
that there were no undergraduate
numerals on the quad —especially
no underclass numerals. A class
has to attain to the dignity of grad
uation to be privileged to put its
numerals in the quadrangle; and
the freshmen have —at least —four
years before them. The practice
of nocturnal painting is defunct at
Stanford, because it partakes too
much of the idea of "as a thief in
the night." Once in a while indi
viduals forget themselves and their
surroundings and damage property
and the self-respect of the organiza
tion which they mis-represent, but
it is a poor sort of notoriety that
they gain. And it is always the
individual who does the harm. We
do not for an instant deny that we
have on the whole a good freshman
class, with the txueption of those
individuals within it who blatantly
make the same assertion, and in
the asserting and the form thereof
bring the class into discredit and
disrepute.
