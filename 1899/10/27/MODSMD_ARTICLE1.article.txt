The sixth annual game between
the Freshman elevens ot Stanford
and the University of California
takes place tomorrow afternoon at
the Folsom street ground i, corner
Folsom and Sixteenth streets.
No satisfactory comparison can
be made between the two teams, as
shown by the schedule of games
played by both. Berkeley shows
up better in this record, but the
Freshmen have been playing good,
hard football the last two weeks
and show good form. The team
has improved both in offensive and
defensive play and the men have
shown good lighting spirit. The
center and guard of the Freshman
team are strong and aggressive.
The tackles, McFadden and Crow
ell. are good men. McFadden has
had little previous football experi
ence, but makes up for it in light.
Back of the line Roberts, Naramore,
and Smith are god at advancing
the ball. Raitt at quarter is a
strong defensive player and a sure
tackle. From the game the Berke
ley Freshmen played with Belmont
October 24th it seems they are
strong at center and guard, but
through tackle the Belmont hacks
made their best gains. The Ber
keley ends were also weak and failed
to down their men on Valentine's
punts.
