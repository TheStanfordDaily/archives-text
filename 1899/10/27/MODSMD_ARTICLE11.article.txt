The students of the University
owe to Dr. Lester F. Ward a deep
gratitude for the courses of lectures
on Sociology which he has just
completed, and we wish to add to
the words and gift of the class which
has listened to him the thanks of
the student body. Dr. Ward has
taken his vacation time and has
delivered the lectures from his love
of the work, without any compen
sation from the University other
than its good-will and his actual
expenses. We hope that Dr. Ward
may he able to visit us again.
