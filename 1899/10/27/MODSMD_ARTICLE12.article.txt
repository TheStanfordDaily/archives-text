Notice is printed this evening of
a yelling section for tomorrow's
game. Not only should as great a
number of University men as pos
sible go up but it is equally impor
tant that they sit with the yelling
section when they get there. The
actual value of encouragement to
morrow will be relatively even
greater than at the big game.
Freshmen can hardly be expected
to play with the steadiness which
characterizes older players. Con
certed rooting at a critical stage of
the game will count a great deal
towards maintaining confidence
among the players. A Stanford
yelling section is to be roped off in
the grandstand and every man
should be found within the ropes,
ready to do his share in cheering
when our men are successful or en
couraging them when encourage
ment is most needed.
