Tomorrow the first intercollegiate
contest of the year takes place when
the colts of Stanford go against
those of U. C. in the sixth annual
Freshman contest. With the team
we have at present there is every
reason to believe that a victory will
result for the cardinal and the in
itial defeat in a series which will
outdo ours of last year will he ad
ministered to Berkeley. The men

I are all in good condition and
I spirits and everything is propitious.
I When they go on the field tomor
row they will have the University
behind them, and the University's
j athletic honor to maintain. To
them, indeed, comes the highest
privilege, that of heading the list
of victories for this year. We are
not over confident, hut "we know
what we know,"and ovr knowledge
lends us to helieve that victory will
be ours. We have had many things
to contend against, mainly too
much material to pick from, and
hardly enough chance to do the
picking, with fifty candidates for
the team. But they have had the
combined services of the finest
corps of coaches that we have ever
hadâ€”Chamberlin, Cotton, Lew
'
ers, and Reynolds. And as we said
i before, they should bring victory to
| Stanford, and we know they will.
