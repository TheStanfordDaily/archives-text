Dr. Lester F. Ward linished his
courses of lectures on Sociology he
fore the students of Stanford this
afternoon and will leave the Uni
versity to continue his duties for
the Smithsonian National Museum
early next week. After the lecture
this afternoon the class presented to
Dr. Ward a slight gift as a token of
their appreciation of his lectures.
The gift was a line valise with a
silver name tag engraved with the
words, ''Lester F. Ward, Washing
ton, 1). C." Dr. Ward is going to
I'aris next year and it was thought
that he would find such an article
exceedingly useful, and al the same
time a constant remembrance of his
stay at Stanford. -I. E. Springer,
'00, presented the gift in a short
hut appropriate speech, and also
handed to him on hehalf of the
class the following short address
with the signatures of the members
of the class:
"To Dr. Lester F. Ward: As an
inadequate expression of our ap
preciation of the exceptional oppor
tunity which you have so gener
ously given us to listen to your
lectures on Pure and Applied Soci
ology, and as a testimonial of our
great enjoyment of the month's

work, we ask you to accept this as
surance and trust that any pleasure
which you may have had in the
performance of the services will he
increased by this token of theÂ«grat
itude of the recipients."
The lectures given by Dr. Ward
have be#m exceptionally enjoyable,
and especially to those who have
done work in the department of
Economics and Sociology in the
University. Dr. Ward has thrown
his whole soul into them, and has
demonstrated, if such demonstra
tion were necossary, that he is a
great sociologist. He has worked
out a complete system of sociology
and so thoroughly believes in it
that it has been a great treat to
hear him unfold it.
