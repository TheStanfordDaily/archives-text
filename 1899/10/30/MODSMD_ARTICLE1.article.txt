Longest run, 17 yards, by Smith of Stanford, end of second half.
Longest punt, 47 yards, by Valentine of California, latter part o
second half.

About 3000 people witnessed the
game Saturday between the Stan
ford and California Freshmen.
Stanford won by a score of 6-0,
after an exciting game. The Stan
ford Freshmen played a hard
game, sending the halves through
the tackles from the start. No end
runs were tried in the first half,
and this probably accouts for the
low score. Stanford caught the
first kick-off on her ten yard line
and kicked the ball down the field
in eighteen consecutive plays, for
fifty-five yards. Berkeley got the
ball on a fumble on her forty-yard
line. California punted back im
mediately and our Freshmen
started bucking the line again,
seventy yards from California's
goal. In sixteen plays the backs
advanced tlfe ball fifty yards, when
ii was lost on downs.
In the second half there was
more kicking by both sides, Valen
tine outpunting Huberts, except
when forced to kick high, by
our men breaking through his
line. The winning touch-down
was made about four minutes be
fore time was called. Smith car
ried the ball just to the line. It
was sometime before it was decid
ed a touch-down. Roberts kicked
an easy goal.
For Stanford, McFadden did the
best work in the line, breaking
through and tackling in varsity
style. Behind the line I'arker,
Smith, Roberts, and Raitt all
played good strong ball. Smith
was given the ball more than either
I'arker or Roberts, and smashed
through Berkeley's tackle for good
gains. At the end of the second
half Smith was given the ball for
an end play and made the longest
run of the day, gaining seventeen
van's before lie was downed.
Before the game was called there
was a dispute over the eligibility
of .John and Naratnore. Coach
Chamberiin dropped the two men
rather than have the game called
off. Lee and Barker were substi-
For California, Valentine put up
the best game, punting well. The
longest kick, forty seven yards, was
made by him in the latter part of

the second half Cadwalader.
Olympic Club coach, who acted as
umpire, saitl that Stanford out
played Berkeley at all points ex
cept kicking, lie thought that Val
entine's kicking was all that kept
Stanford's score down.
According to intercollegiate ath
letic agreement, the list of eligible
players must he submitted to the
other sitle three weeks before the
game. This year Stanford list was
submitted one day late and the list
from Berkeley was submitted a
week after the required time. No
objection was made and both lists
were accepted and returned. Sev
eral days after this Berkeley sent
down the names of five more men
and these were accepted. It was
then found that the names of John
and Naratnore were omitted from
the Stanford list and these were
sent up to Berkeley. No objection
was made until just before the
game was called, when Berkeley
refused to play il these men were
allowed to go in the game. John
and Naratnore deserve great credit
for their conscientious work
throughout the season. They prac
ticed hard and won their places in
close competition, and to be shut
out at the last moment was a great
disappointment.
From one end of the Stanford
line to the other, omitting the ends
themsfclves, there were better indi
vidual players than in the Berkeley
line. The tackles continually broke
through and frequently slopped the
runner for a big loss. On the aver
age our men were about lour pounds
heavier than their opponents, but
the line men were of about equal
weight, the Berkeley backs being
much lighter than Stanford's. Cap
tain Raitt deserves great credit for
the manner in which he controlled
his team. lie played a slow game,
rel vng too much, probably, on the
superior st renglh of his line, and if
he had tried more end runs the
score might have been larger. The
Stanford men played their best
from first to last, and as Umpire
Cadwalader has said, they out
played their opponents in every
point of the game except in kick
ing.

The crowd was probably the
largest which has ever witnessed an
intercollegiate Freshman game.
The rooting was good at times, hut
could be greatly improved by more
practice. Although the grounds
were more accessihlelo the students
from Berkeley, the rooters were
about evenly divided and Stanford
easily held its own in that feature
of the game.
The line-up, with the weights of
the various men, was as follows :
