# Sunday Sermon.

### 
In the absence of Rabbi Voor
sanger, Mrs. Ruth Murray spoke in i
the chapel Sunday morning. She
chose for a text, "In the beginning,
God." She said in part: "When
we go back to the beginning we
find God, watching and caring for
Mis creation. Jn the time of Isaiah
we have evidences of His care, in
such verses as He shall feed his
flock like a shepherd.' In the
olden time of the sacrifices the por
tions of the offering retained for
the priest were the breast and the
shoulder: the shoulder, the sym
bol of strength, and the breast, the
symbol of love. Thus the strength
I and love of the Lord were to be the
portion of His priests. Jesus
I Christ has ordained that we should
I in the supper of the communion
| take the place of the priests of old.
Everywhere the voice of nature is
heard, praising God with one ac
cord. Man only is silent or de
graded in vice and sin. God has
come to set us free from our bond
age. He is waiting to come into
our lives with dynamic force so
that we too may add our voices to
I the song of praise to the Redeemer
i of men.
"There is an obituary in the
| Bible which all might covet: 'And
Enoch walked with God and was
not, for God took him.' If Enoch
| walked with God in the misty
I twilight in which he lived, how
| much more ought we to walk with
| the Lord Jesus Christ, who was
manifested to ub to take away our
sins.
"Living is not merely perform
ing the functions of life. Von
come here, most of you, so that
you may learn how to live and how |
to become better citizens. The
man who lives under the guidance
of God is enabled to live better and
finally to conquer in Ilis name.
In the beginning of each day take
God and keep Him throughout life
until He who was the morning
light becomes the evening star of
your existence.
'•Finally, in the beginning of
work, pleasure, study, duty, of
everything —God.
