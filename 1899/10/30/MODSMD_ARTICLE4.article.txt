### 
In ii dispatch from New York to
the San Francisco Chronicle, it is
stated that Mrs. Stanford will leave
the East the end of this week for
California, and she is reported as
having said the following to a news
paper representative :
" The University now has 1400
students 500 girls and 900 hoys.
I have limited the number of girls
who can attend to 500, as there was
such an influx of them that they
outnumbered the boys and threat
ened to destroy the identity of the
University as a masculine seat of
learning, which it should be, since
it is ii: commemoration of my son.
" In the Library i am about to
place three stained glass windows.
The center one is llolman Hunt's
" Light of the World," and this
motto appears beneath it : " I
bring peace to this house." The one
on the left represents Moses sitting
with his tablets and writing the
commandments, while that on the
left portrays Thomas a Kenipis with
the " Imitation of Christ,' in his
hands. J am a firm believer in
object teaching.
" Before 1 left California 1 told
my architects to consult with Dr.
Jordan, the President of the Uni
versity, as to what further buildings
he needed, and they will be devoted
to chemistry and art. The plans
are now awaiting my approval.
"The main archway of the outer
quadrangle (governor Stanford
planned >is a memorial arch, it is
100 feet high and 84 feet wide. Mr.
Stanford sent for St. Ciaudens, the
sculptor, and told him that he
wanted a has relief, with figures of
heroic size, depicting the history of
American civilization. St. Gaudens
has completed the plans for this
has relief, and they are really won
derful. The civilization begins with
the Indian wickiup and is brought
down, step by step, to the present
day. When completed it will be
placed on the arch twenty feet from
the top, and will be twelve feet
wide.
'' In all that 1 have done since
mv husband's death I have closely
adhered to the plans to which he
gave his approval, and I am more
than thankful that time has been
given me to finish this work."
