The Freshmen have played and
won their game, and we congratu
late them. It was a noble game
and a noble victory, and as a re
sult the Cardinal is animated as
no other pre-Thanksgiving event
could animate it. We hail Coach
Chamberlin, we hail Captain
Raitt and every man on his team,
as well as those who tried hard
for it but didn't make it. To all
we say, "Yourservice has been well
done; enjoy the fruits of your
labors." What does this victory
m«\an to Stanford? Did an infer
ior team, backed by superior grit,
win against a superior team? We
answer "no." Did unmanly bick
erings on our part, at the last min
ute before the game was called,
place us at an advantage? We
refer this to Berkeley. The victory
simply means that eleven gritty
men, with superior coaching and
training, went against eleven
worthy opponents and defeated
them by a combination of skil 1, de
termination, and inherent ability.
It does not mean that we are now
sure of beating Berkeley on
Thanksgiving day because hereto
fore in contests between Stanford
and Berkeley a Freshman victory
has been followed by a Varsity
victory. J t simply encourages us
more than ever to do our very best
and to all work together as we

never worked before. It means
that if we go at a tiling in the
right way we shall attain our ends
—make our touch-down and kick
our goal.
