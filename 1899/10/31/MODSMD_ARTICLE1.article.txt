# ON THE OVAL.
## Coach Chamberlin Requests the Men to be on the Field by 4 O'clock. 
### 
Two elevens lined up on the oval
last night for a short practice. The
second eleven bucked through the
Varsity line for gains. The prac
tice finally developed into a kick
ing contest in which Murphy out
pointed Rodolph. McFadden played
at left tackle on the second, and was
then tried at the same position < n
the Varsity. Faris was tried at
half on the second, for the first
time this season.
Following is the lines up of the
two :

Coach Chamberlin complains
that the men do not get out on
time and says they should make an
effort to be on the held by 4 o'clock,
or as soon after that as possible.
It gets dark so quickly that after
punting and signal practice there
is but about twenty minutes for
practice. The work of the team is
going on slowly, owing to injuries
and sickness among the men.
There are not enough men out for
football. Last evening there were
scarcely enough for two elevens,
and there should be enough to
make four elevens. A second team
is just as necessary as a Varsity.
The team iH especially weak for
want of heavy half-backs. Any
man who weighs one hundred and
sixtv or over should get out and
make a try for half.
