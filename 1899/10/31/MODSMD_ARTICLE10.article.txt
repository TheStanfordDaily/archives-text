Only a few weeks remain until
the Thanksgiving game, and if our
men are to make a good showing
at that time it will he necessary
for them to get into good, hard
practice and to keep it up until
the day of the game. Coach Cham
herlin is without exception the
first man on the field every night
and is often compelled to wait an
hour or more for enough men to
begin the practice. This is not as
it should he. The men have heen
requested to appear on the field at
4 o'clock and they should make
every effort to be out as near that
time as possible. From now on the
daily practices will go far in choos
ing the final team and it rests with
the men themselves what the result
will he. The coach cannot pick a
winning team without the men to
choose from, and the men can
not play winning ball unless they
have hard practice each night. All
men who are able should remain
on the field and thus assist the
Varsity in the evening practice.
Though hut few will be able to
make the final eleven, the work of
the others in giving those men
their practice through the season
will be appreciated by them as
well as by the student body at
large.
