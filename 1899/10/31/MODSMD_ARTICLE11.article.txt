We print ii few extracts from the
Daily Californian. The first from
a news article:
" It was the third down. If the
enemy made their touch-down, we
would be defeated beyond hope of
redemption. If the ball lacked a
single inch of touching the line, we
could then kick it out of danger,
and there would he no chance for
any score. It was decided that the
ball did touch the line, and accord
ingly the score of the game stands
6 0. The writer of this article saw
the play in question from a dis
tance of less thiin ten feet, and
gives the following as an unpreju
diced statement, which will be cor
roborated by other witnesses. The

Stanford runner went down with
the ball under his breast, lacking
about eighteen inches of touching
the line with it. The whistle
sounded the down, and an excited
crowd of about a hundred persons
rushed in to see whether a score
had been made or not. The
Stanford man having the hall
shoved it ahead of him the full
length of his arms as he rose from
the ground, thus putting it on the
line. Meanwhile, Cadwallader,
the referee, was paying no atten
tion to anything but the surround
ing crowd, and declaring that he
would give no decision until the
held was cleared. After about five
minutes this was accomplished,
and Cadwallader then examined
the position of the ball and de
clared that it touched the line."
The next is an editorial:
"Well done, Freshmen. Cali
fornia rejoices in your play and in
your spirit. Above all your Uni
versity takes pride in the fairness
of your game. We would not add
to the of the Cardinal con
science. We will bide our time,
Freshmen. Wait till Thanksgiv
ing day."
Comment on these two is hardly
necessary. It seems that Califor
nia has forgotten how to take a de
feat in a sportsmanlike manner.
One would scarcely think that a
single season of victory would so
far obliterate the lessons they
learned in seven previous years;
lessons which every college knows
and which are summed up in the
following: Take your victories
moderately and keep your mouth
shut when you areclearly whipped.
But Berkeley forgets, as we have
said; and in the first article par
ticularly forgets that courtesy due
an official, selected by her own
side to boot, and the obligation
placed on all contestants to abide
by a referee's decision. We are
sorry that the college across the
Bay so completely reverses its ap
proval of a man who was once a
student there, a candidate for the
varsity, and an assistant coach.
It is all too bad.
As for the editorial reference to
"fairness" and "pangs of the Car
dinal conscience" we have only to
state the facts about Gammon and
the unmanly bickerings of the
Berkeley management. It would
seem that the time has about arrived
when our opponents should put
aside their childish ways and re
solve to be men, then to bear vic
tory and defeat in a manly, sports
manlike manner. In the mean
time, we too, "wait till Thanks
giving day."
