# Dramatic Recital
## 
### 
Preliminary arrangements were
completed today whereby Kather
ine E. Oliver, the young American
girl, famous in two continents for
her wonderful portrayal of charac
ter, will appear in the chapel for
one evening, November 13ih. Miss
Oliver's Stanford engagement will
be under tbe auspices of the Senior
Class, which is to be congratulated
on securing this distinguished artist
on her first Western tour. The
success of Miss Oliver's portrayal
of her own dramatizations of the
popular Scotch stories of the day,
has been phenomenal. She has
been entertained by the authors of
the stories she interprets, and her
last year's tour in Scotland and Eng
land, including noteworthy recitals
in " Thrums" and " Drumtochty,"
was under the patronage of lan
McClaron. J. M. Ha trie, J. It.
Crockett, Joseph Parker, etc. In
America she has no peer on tbe
platform, and her popularity as an
entertainer has reached that of J.
\V. Riley and Mark Twain, ller
American patrons have been such
people as Bishop Vincent, Edward
Everett Hale, President Harper,
Dr. VVm. J. Ltolfe, President Mc-
Kiuley, and others of distinction.
Miss Oliver's first great success was
so<.red when, in lcS9(5, she drama
tized and gave as a monologue re
cital J. M. Barrie's popular story,
'The Little Minister." This was
followed by a second success, "The
Drumtochty Characters," arranged
from the "Bonnie Brier Bush,"
which was given fifty times in a
single city (Pittsburg, Pa.) during
the first season. Since then she
has added to her repertoire ''The
Play Actress." "The Lilac Sunbon
net," "Sentimental Tommy," "A
Window in Thrums," and many
others. The phiy for the campus
recital has not yet been selected.
It will probably be chosen from the
works of Barrie or Crockett.
