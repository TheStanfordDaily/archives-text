Dane Coolidge is a young man
who has established a profitable
business in a new line of work
which is probably the most danger
ous of all kinds.
He is a collector of live animals
for museums.
Mr. Coolidge is a man of culture
and education, lie graduated
from Stanford and then spent a
year as a ''post-grad" at Harvard.
He is now engaged in collecting
live and venomous reptiles, birds,
and mammals for a number of the
large scientific institutions of the
country.
He is doing work of especial in
terest, because of the diiliculty that
museums and parks have in get
ting competent men to make col
lections of live animals.
Coolidge has had a long and suc
cessful experience in collecting and
trapping both before and after he
entered Stanford. In fact, such
work lias been his hobby since he
was large enough to work alone,
and as a consequence of his early
training he has had a good begin
ning 011 a valuable stock of scien
tilic knowledge.
At present the institutions for
which Coolidge is collecting are the
Smithsonian Institution, the New
York Zoological Park at Central
Park, of which William T. Horna
dav, the celebrated naturalist, is
a director, and Lincoln Park at
Chicago.
The natuie of the work of course
requires that he visit many differ
ent localities, and not only must
he go where the* animals he wants
are found, but In- must remain
long enough to U come thoroughly
acquainted with the habits and the
life history of his victims, and in
this lies the chief interest in tin
work.
For instil nee, many trappers
have attenij od without suceess to
capture the common cormc rants
which frequent the rocky beaches
and points of the Pacific, and after
much study and observation, Cool
idge hit upon the simple plan of
stealing upon them at night clad
in rubber shoes.
During the past summer Cool
idge hits been at his work in South
ern California, and as a result of
his efforts he has some very fine
specimens.
At college the stories say that
Coolidge was something of a char
acter. For three of his four years
at Stanford he was the presiding
genius at the Camp â€”an aggrega
tion of low, wooden buildings situ
ated behind the college power-house
where poor students congregated,
instead of living in the far more
pleasant and commodious quarters
at Kncina Hall or the other places
about the canipus.
; Here is the center of student act-
It ivil ies for self-support. and Dane,
; as Coolidge is familiarly known
about the University,assisted many
students to find ;i way for turning
an honest penny.
He was prominently connected

with the Sequoia, the college week
ly, ;i.s u contribute throughout his
college career, and in his senior
year was its editor-in-chief, turn
ing out one of the best volumes of
the eight already issued.
