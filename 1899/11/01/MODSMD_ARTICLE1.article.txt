## Improvement Noticed in the Play of Varsity and Second Elevens.

The teams lined up for practice
on the oval last night. A number
of men were tried in new positions.
On the Second, Faris was put in at
full and played hard, bucking the
line in good style. Erb was played
at half and put up a good game.
Emerson, at tackle, ran well with
the ball, always making good gums.
McFadden was laid oil lor the day,
and Raitt was tried on bis end.
The Second eleven had the ball
the greater part of the practice and
bucked through the Varsity line,
Murphy punting back when the
Varsity secured the ball on downs.
A new formation on the kick was
tried by the Varsity and the Sec

kicks.
