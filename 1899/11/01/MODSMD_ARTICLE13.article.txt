The game begun almost an hour
late, owing to Stanford's insisting
that John should he allowed to
play at center, and Narainore at
half, although their names were
not on the list exchanged between
the faculties of the two universities.

For the benefit of those who may
have an erroneous impression,
either from the garbled reports of
the San Francisco dailies or from
the falsity of the Californian, re
garding the eligibility of the pro
tested players in the Freshman
game, we publish the following
facts: According to the intercol
legiate athletic agreement between
the two universities, the lists of
players have to be submitted three
weeks before any contest, and all
protests made at least one week
before the game in question. The
day previous to the expiration of
the time for submitting names, a
note came from Berkeley saying,
"I suppose you are working on
your lists," that California was not
yet ready with hers and would be
late in getting it down. Our list
went up a few days later, —after
the time-limit had expired. Berke
ley's list came down several days
later still. In the list submitted
at first John's name was left off by
a clerical error in the Registrar's
oflice. This was afterwards cor
rected and John's name was ac
cepted; then Berkeley sent down
five names for Manager Berry's
ratification, which were uncondi
tionally accepted here. It was then
found that Naramore's name had
never been sent in. This was com
municated to Manager Muma by
Mr. Leiter and Mr. Berry, and the
amendment was accepted by him.
Hut on the day of the game Mr.
Muma protested the playing of
John and Narainore. More than
that, he insisted on the playing of
one Gammon, which was some
thing our management objected to

as Gammon's name had never ap
peared on any list between the col
leges. In evidence we print the
following from the Califomian of
October 24th:
Editor of the Calif omian : —ln
order to set at rest all questioning
as to who are or who are not elig
ible to play in the Intercollegiate
Freshman football game, the fol
lowing named constitute the list
from which, under the intercolleg
iate agreement, the team will lie
chosen : Geo. C. Edwards.
Chairman Committee on Athletics.
Then follows the list, to which is
added :
The above official communication
speaks for itself. It will be noticed
by reading the list of names that
some strong players, notably Gam
mon, are definitely ruled out by
tiie committee, who state that their
action is absolutely final.
And this from the issue of Octo
ber 27 :
To correct any misunderstanding,
it may again be stated that neither
Gammon nor Kington will play in
tomorrow's game.
They refused to play unless Gam
mon went on at end, or they
would bar Gammon if we put
out Naramore and John, whose
eligibility had never before been
questioned by the management or
faculty of either university. In
spite of the pettiness of such trick
ery Stanford acted in the sports
manlike manner, and by the advice
and suggestion of Coach Chamber
lin, played the game without the
two protested Stanford men. These
are the facts, and all delay and
argument was caused by Berkeley's
actions and not Stanford's. In
justice to Parker and Lee,
who took the place of the pro
tested men, it must be admitted
that in the minds of many
we lost nothing by the change,
but stood merely on a matter of
principle. We may conclude by
saying that Berkeley has been
guilty of actions in the previous
intercollegiate relations of the two
universities that were farther from
the true spirit of gentlemanly,
amateur sport; but for absolute
pettiness in the first place and
malice in trying to cast the blame
on Stanford in the second place,
the action of California on the
Freshman game of 1899 stands
without a parallel.
