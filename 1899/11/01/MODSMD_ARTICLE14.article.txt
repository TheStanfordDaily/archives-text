No recent magazine papers have
attracted so much attention, afford
ed so much entertainment, and cre
ated such lively and widespread dis
cussions, as Kollin Lynde Hartt's
Atlantic essays," The Montanians "
and "A New England Hill Town."
In his new article,"The Ohioans,' in
the November Atlantic, Mr. llart
carries his characteristic method
into a new and prolific and widely
interesting field ; and his pictures
of the Buckeye State, and of the
"Buckeyes" at home and abroad,
will be eagerly read and enjoyed,
even by those who recognize them
selves as the subjects of his good
natured satire and his keen and
amusing characterization. Mr.
Hartt's methods of observation are
not superficial, and his treatment,
while distinctly facetious, is not
flippant ; but lie has the unique
faculty of seeing the salient points
of a community, and presenting
their humorous side in a manner
that is not merely amusing, but
also covers a serious purpose, and a
keen and thoughtful analysis of
the situation. "The Ohioans" shows
a distinct advance in power over
Mr. Hartt's former papers, and is
of universal interest —apart from
its humorous treatment —for what
ever concerns the great Presidential
State concerns the interests of the
whole country.
