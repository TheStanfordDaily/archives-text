# Improvement of Paths.
## 
### 
Surveyors are at work running
lines for enlarging the pedestrian
and bicycle paths along Univer
sity avenue to Palo Alto and
laborers are clearing the trees away
prior to grading. The paths are to
receive additions from the arbore
tum side of eleven feet each, which
will make them about seventeen
feet in width. They will he prop
erly graded and surfaced with cin
ders, thus providing against erosion
from rains. The increased width
will lie a safety factor on dark
nights, and the better surface will
preclude the use of the pedestrian
path by bicyclists.
