Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Id yesterday's issue you state
that I have been given charge of
the children's page of the Ladies'
Home Journal. This surprises me
greatly. No doubt the editor of the
.Journal would be even more sur
prised. I wish to express my grat
itude to you for this announcement.
It must l>e true or you wouldn't
publish it; and L should dislike to
neglect so important a duty through
ignorance of appointment.
If you should happen to have
any spare copy that would interest
children, I should be glad to take
it off your hands.
Albert \V. Smith.
