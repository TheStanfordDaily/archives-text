The second issue of the Chaparral
eame out hist week and isa distinct
improvement over the first one,
being, particularly, inure local in
character. It omitted the double
center-page cartoon, making up for
it by the I wo extra pages of reading
matter, one of them being a very
clever take-off of a recent editorial
page of the U. C. Occident. A con

tinned story, "An Appendix," by
Larrey Bowman \v:ib started and
will run through several issues, the
first installment leaving the char
acters at a very critical juncture.
A copy of the Freshman constitu
tion is given, and the full details of
a recent society event are chronicled.
The drawings, while fewer in num
ber than in the previous issue, are
on the whole more clever, and are
the work of Larry Bowman, '01,
R. Keith Culver, '99, C. de (2.
Whittle, ex-'OO, and \V. L. Daven
port, ex-'o'2. The writing of the
issue is from the pens of Bristow
Adams,'oo, Larrey Bowman, '01,
R. Keith Culver, '99, IJ. 1). Walter,
'00, and Fletcher Wagner, 'OH.
The next number will be a foot
ball issue and will be out about a
week before the game. A perma
nent change to sixteen pages from
twelve will be inaugurated with
the forthcoming number, and foot
ball material is solicited to make
the issue a success.
