# THE
						PLUG UGLY.
## The
						Juniors Present a Creditable Program at Their Hat Dedication. 
### 
When the perpetuation of the
Plug Ugly was discussed by the
Class of 15)01 a month ago, at least
four locations were proposed. First
the Arboretum, which was given
up for lack of seating facilities;
then the Frenchman's lake and
Lake Lagunita, both places, it was
decided, being too far from the
campus and Palo Alto ; and lastly
the football field, which for its
many advantages was finally
chosen. With the last year's cele
bration for a guide the men of '01
went to work on a somewhat differ
ent idea. It was thought advisable
to use hired costumes and to have
good illumination and music. On
account of the expense connected
with the Annual the class was un
able to give any large appropria
tion for the affair. But as far as
the money at his disposal would
allow, Mr. Hamilton's plans were
carried out.
The field was by no means dry
and the performers were forced to
stand in half an inch of sticky
mud. At eight the performance
was supposed to begin, but at least
an hour before that, silent and ex
pectant groups had been gathering
on the grandstand. A large audi
ence was soon assembled, and by
eight o'clock the bleachers were
filled and the side lines crowded.
About six hundred people were
I > resent.
Down in the middle of the field,
with two S. P. headlights focussed
upon it, stood the '01 plug, fully
seven feet high At the appointed
hour a grotesque procession filed
out of the darkness, divided on
both sides of the hat and formed a
semicircle facing the grandstand.
As they came forward they sang:
"All hail the Prince,
Ile comes, he comes,
AII hail the Prince,
He comes.
All our revels gophornoric
Might have been a. bit caloric
But we'll have them hydrochloric
When the fair Prince comes.'"
As soon as the song stopped, J.
E. Wilson opened the dialogue.
Eugene Warren, as Keeper «>f the
Sophomoric Dignity—that was —
appointed his court, conferring
Knighthood on the Knights of the
Crown, Brim, Hat Band,and Sweat
Band. Warren delivered a short
speech to each of these dignitaries,
and each replied before receiving
the badge of office. Tlte speeches
were generally clever, and brought
continued acknowledgment, from
the bleachers. The following is a
sample of the oath, which was aimed
particularly at the Freshmen
By the vivo, by the vivo, and even
by the vum,
By the rat-trap, by the cat-trap, by
the whole thing, which is bum,
By the honorary members, Mrs.
Stanford, I)oc, and all i
By all Freshman reformations, im
promptu glee 3 in Nortree Hall,
By the fame for which they lan
guish, by their gall we cannot
stand,
Do you swear to keep it holy oh,
Sentinel of the Band ?

Warren's acting was perfect.
The court having been appointed,
Marrack, as herald, hursts through
the semicircle, and announces the
coming of the Prince. The Prince,
it has been announced, shall come
" riding an elephant white as
driven snow." Mr. Marrack deliv
ers the sonorous words, " The sacred
elephant is on the march, w a thou
sand angels attend his flight," and
others to that effect. But instead
of a prince and an elephant, a
small man with a red wig and a
hump-back rides in on a spotted
burro. The Juniors are supposed
to be disappointed and are about
to tear the Plug Ugly to pieces
when F. C. Wright, as the Seer
from the University of Babylon,
appears and quells the disturbance,
lie had a rather difficult part, and
his voice was haidly equal to the
task. It was here that the action
dragged, while the Babylonian
pi led up a rhetorical tower of Babel,
to the final effect that Plug Ugly
must undergo the ordeal of fire.
Accordingly the unfortunate So
bey is put into the ping, while the
audience may imagine him con
sumed in purifying fire. The Seer
performs his incantations before
the hat, and, having given the word,
"Come forth!" the real Prince,
dressed in red and bearing a shield
inscribed "60 -f-," appears in a
blaze of red light. This important
character was to have been taken
by Phil. Oilman, but owing to an
injury in the football practice last
week he was unable to take part.
Maples accordingly was induced to
take the part, lie did much better
than could reasonably be expected,
as he had enly one day's
notice, and made an impres
sive figure. In conclusion the
Juniors were commanded to wear
their hats on all occasions. The
" entire company " then joined in
the second verse of the " Son of a
Gondolier." This song was of an
intensely virtuous character, but it
had not been rehearsed sufficiently,
and the wrong part was accentu
ated It was not the purpose of the
Juniors to end their ceremony with
a general burst of defiance. The
lines rend distinctly :
" We'll get dead drunk at the Car
dinal Cat
On Shasta instead of beer!"
The chorus, which is already his
tory, bears repeating :
I'm a son of a son of a son of a son
Of a son of a Gondolier ;
I'm a son of a son of a son of a son
Of a son of a Gondolier ;
Like every honest fellow I like my
milk —
That's queer !
I'm a son of a son of a son of a son
Of a son of a Gondolier !
The celebration was a distinct
success and it will, no doubt, be
come an established custom here.
To J. 11. Hamilton is due most of
the credit, though Erb, as stage
manager, proved himself indispens
able. The audience was in a re
ceptive mood and no joke however
modest failed to draw at least one
laugh out of the good-natured
grandstand. All the parts were
well carried out, and Wright's lines
In-fore the incantation, if too long,
were, for all that, well written.
