The Plugs huve been dedicated
and the Juniors have now formally
taken upon themselves the insignia
of upper-class men. They are to he
congratulated for the success of
their efforts in thus firmly estab
lishing the Plug Ugly as an annual
class ceremony. Profiting by the
experience of last year's Juniors,
they were able to make theirs the
best of these exercises yet held.
The program was carried out suc
cessfully and with credit to all who
took part.
The same cannot be said, how
ever, of the Sophomores. The mem
bers of this class seemed to forget
that they are but one year past
being Freshmen, and that when
they endeavor to interfere with the
proceedings of either of the two
upper classes, they assume an
effrontery equaled only by the
Freshmen when they placed their
class numerals beside those of the

Class of '95 in the quadrangle.
Last night the Sophomores acted
worse than Freshmen ; they
not only endeavored to pre
vent the proceedings, but after
the program was completed
and the procession started around
the campus, instead of fall
ing in behind as they should have
done, they mixed in with the upper
class men, and endeavored to pick
free fights with individuals. Then,
not satisfied with the tying-up
which they received at the hands
of the Freshmen in the beginning
of the semester, they sought a rush
with the Juniors, and only the
good sense and propriety of the
latter prevented a disgraceful end
ing of the evening's performance.
The Sophomores seemed to have
forgotten entirely that they are not
in a class to interfere in any way
with the Junior or Senior classes. As
under-class men they should look
for their trouble with the Freshmen
only. The destruction of the large
plug which has been handed down
to each succeeding Junior class
from the beginning of the custom
was another act which goes en
tirely without excuse. Now, Sopho
mores, take a little friendly advice.
You were Freshmen last year, that
should be enough ; if you want to
remain Freshmen, change your
standing. The Freshman class is
large enough this year, but it would
be better to have one than two.
