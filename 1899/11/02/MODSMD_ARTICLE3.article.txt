# Hallowe'en Party.
## 
### 
Tuesday evening the young la
dies of Madrono Hall gave a re
ception to the Faculty, which was
in many ways one of the pleasant
est affairs ever given on the cam
pus. A couple of weeks ago unique
invitation!*, written on yellow pa
per pumpkins, were sent out, and
in answer to them all sorts of notes
came, from the regulation, formal
acceptance, written on monogrStn
paper, to acceptances on yellow
corncobs, green squashes, little
brown jugs, and freshly baked pie.
The rooms on the first and sec
ond floors of the hall were prettily
decorated 112( r the occasion with
bamboo, pepper, and holly
berries. Everything was arranged
to suggest the mystic signifi
cance of the night. On the ar
rival of the guests the men and
women separated, and were taken
in charge by the guiding spirits of
the occasion. As the men entered
the reception hall they were ush
ered into the presence of the pre
siding genius of the affair, the High
Spook, who held court in utter
darkness, and who compelled each
man to register, and to swear by
all the traditions of the night not
to divulge the secrets about to be
made known to him.
In the women's reception-room
each guest was given a string, and
in following it up went all over the
house, finding at the end her for
tune wound around a sprig of
parsely.
For the bachelors and spinsters
there was a separate room, and
here, seated round a huge caldron,
were the three wrinkled witches,
who, with weird incantations, in
voked the aid of the spirits in tell
ing the fortunes of the guests.
The verandah was the scene of
the potato races. These were hotly
contested, and all sorts of devices
resorted to in order that the favor
ites might win. Mrs. C. B. Whit
tier and 11. Muckleson were the
lucky ones, and carried off great
bunches of flowers as prizes. Blow
ing soap-bubbles was another di
version, and Professor Jenkins
demonstrated his ability to blow
the biggest one, and received an im
mense bunch of chrysanthemums
for the effort.
Down in the basement every kind
of Hallowe'en trick was played â€”
pulling candy, bobbing for apples,
snap-dragon, and numbers of oth

j era. Refreshments were served up
j stairs, ami consisted of good, old
fashioned cider and gingerbread,
I popcorn, apples, and roasted chest
j nuts.
i The guests of the evening entered
heartily into all the games planned
for their amusement, and the even
ing was, altogether, a very happy
one.
