The widening of the pedestrian
and bicycle paths to Palo Alto will
be an improvement which every
one will appreciate and which will
add considerably to the beauty of
the avenue. The paths have been
somewhat narrow for the demands
made upon them. On account of
the overhanging palm branches a
passing on the bicycle path has
even in some places been attended
with danger. As the University
population of Palo Alto increases,
there had thus arisen considerable
ground for controversy between
the cyclists and pedestrians, and a
great deal of discussion over the
intrusion of one upon the privi
leges of the other has arisen. A
seventeen-foot path on each side of
the avenue will obviate any excuse
for this trouble in the future, and
will add to our already beautiful
drive a walk and a cycle path of
which there can be no complaint.
