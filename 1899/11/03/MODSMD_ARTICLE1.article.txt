# TOMORROW'S GAME.
## Varsity Will Meet the Olympics in the Third Match of the Season. 
### 
Tomorrow's pa me between the
Varsity and the Olympic Club
teams will be interesting on account
of the number of the games which
have been played this season with
the club teams by the two univer
sities. Both teams have In en prac
ticing hard since the last game and
the chances are that touchdowns
will be made tomorrow. The
Olympics have been defeated but
once, then by California when they
were in poor condition. As they
are unable to hold regular daily
practice they gain most of their
training from these games.
A number of substitutes will be
taken up with the Varsity, and will
probably be given a chance to play.
The grounds will be in much bet
ter shape than they were two weeks
ago, the date of our last game with
the Olympic team, and a better
game is expected.
Following is the probable line-up
of the two teams :
Rice <U^en | 1 fend r... Hamilton
Bentley 1 tackle r Sheehy
De Forest. . .1 guard r.Cadwallader
Hay den center Monroe
llust,m r guard 1... j

held on the gridiron for the first
time this week. The Second eleven,
strengthened by Coach Chaniberlin
at center and lowers at l ight guard,
took the ball at the kick-off. and by
steady line bucking forced the Var
sity back for a touch-down. The
Second tried giving the ends the
ball on a delayed pass, and twice
made good gains. The Varsity,
however, caught the runners back
of the line after the first few trials.
Later in the same half the Varsity
ran the ball down to the Second's
ten-yard Hue, and secured a touch
down on a fumble by the Sccond.
Three elevens were out, and all
