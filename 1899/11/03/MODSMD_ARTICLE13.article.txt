Since the Freshman game, wails
have been heard from Palo Alto to
the effect that no objection was made
to the playing of John and Nara
viore, contrary to the intercollegiate
agreement-, until just before the game
was begun, and that therefore U. C.
athletic methods are of a low order.
Manager Minna, replying to this
charge, states that notice was given
four days before the game that no
new Cardinal players would be
allowed to participate. Moreover,
Smith, Stanford's dashing half-back,
who was allowed to play, ivas not
strictly an eligible man. And
although the faculty of this Univer
sity has insisted upon the strictest
observance of the intercollegiate
agreement, Stanford's ma nagement
has been allowed free rein, so that
they offered to let Gammon, lirayley,
and JAppmanplayon our Freshman
team, if we would let them ploy Nat
Carle, although none of these men
are freshmen, liy the sending of
two emissaries into San Luis Obispo
county, eleven "Freshmen" were re
cruited, and entered on the rolls of
Stanford University the day before
the thirty-day limit expired.
It is scarcely necessary to say
anything concerning the above.
The statements show clearly that
the management at Herkeley has
reached its limit, and we feel there
is nothing more to say. We give
the following statements of facts,
furnished by Manager Berry:
Manager Murna did not give
"four days notice before the game

that no new Cardinal players
would be allowed to participate."
On the contrary, before Manager
Muma had submitted his Fresh
man list, he had informed Mr.
Berry, in the presence of Mr. Leiter,
upon receiving the letter of Profes
sor Richardson and the statement
of Registrar Elliott, that he would
allow John to play without ques
tion. Later, he tried to re-open ne
gotiations and secure the "trade"
of John for Gammon, and repeat
edly offered to trade men for Graves
and l)e Forest. No emissaries
were sent to San Luis Obispo and
eleven freshmen were not recruited
from San Luis Obispo county the
day before the thirty-day limit ex
pired. From the books in the
Registrar's office we find that in
the week immediately preceding
the time limit twelve students were
registered; of those five were new
and seven were old students. One
of these came from San Luis Obis
po county. All of the men who
played in the Freshman game reg
istered at the opening of the Uni
versity. Smith was an eligible
freshman in every sense of the
word â€”save that bis name was in
advertently omitted from the list
sent in to Berkeley, as in the case
of Naramore. The names of Smith
and Naramore were certified by the
Stanford faculty and submitted to
Professor Edwards on the Tuesday
before the game, a day after Man
ager Berry had received the names
of five U. C. freshmen whose names
were not on the original list and
had been asked to do the U. C.
authorities the courtesy of placing
their names on bis list and allow
ing them to be considered eligible,
in return lie requested the courtesy
of a like favor in the case of Nara
more and Smith. It is a fact that
Berkeley played Holly who had at
least twenty-eight or twenty-nine
hours to his credit and who was a
sub on last year's Freshman team.
