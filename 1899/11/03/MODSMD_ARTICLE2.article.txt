The faculty of the UnivÂ« r.-iiy oi
Nevada has put a Bt<>p to 11 it* .ile
which was to he played next Siiur
day on the Berkeley einiipli- he
tween the Varsity and the NVvada
team. The Nevada** play Stanford
on the lllh, and will probably
meet Berkeley on the Islh, From

all accounts, the Nevada team this
year is by far the strongest that
the university has ever had, and
there is the greatest desire on the
part of both California universities
to know what it can do. " King"
Dickson of Bennsylvania is coach.
TheNevadas last.week defeated the
Santa Clara College eleven,
strengthened by Sheehy and Cow
ard of the Olympics and Ryan of
Butte, by a score of 11 to G.
