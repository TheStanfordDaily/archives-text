# Deaf Mutes Football Players.
## 
### 
The nation's capital claims prob
ably the most peculiar football team
in the country. The team's signals
are given without the utterance of
a word or sound, although they are
of the most approved and complex
kind. All signalling is done by
motions of the hands, arms, and
head. The team is composed en
tirely of deaf mutes, and is or
ganized at the Government Insti
tute for the Deaf and Dumb, known
as Gallaudet College.
The students are especially fond
of athletics, and always t.urn out
strong teams in all branches of
sports undertaken. The football
team is an exceptionally strong
eleven this year, and would prove
very formidable against any college
team it might meet outside of tlie
" big four."â€” U. of M. Daily.
