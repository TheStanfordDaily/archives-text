when our legislature authorized
Governor Hughes to appoint a
State geologist, he sent three tele

the president of Ann Arbor Univer
sity, Michigan ; one to the presi
dent of Cornell University, New
York ; and one to the chief engineer
of the United States army, request
ing them that they recommend the
best geologist in the world. All
three without preconcert recom
