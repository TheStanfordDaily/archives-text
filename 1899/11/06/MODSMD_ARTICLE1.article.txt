# FIRST DEFEAT.
## Club Men Win Saturday's Game by a Score of 6-5. 
### 
The Olympics defeated the Var
sity last Saturday afternoon by a
score of Gto 5. Neither hi le made
a point uiitil late in the game,
although the Olympic bucked to
within one foot of the line in the
first half, and was there held on
downs alter advancing sixty-live
yards in twenty-five plays. Our
score was the result of a beautiful
drop kick by Murphy for a field
goal from the ten-yard line. It
was the second field goal ever made
on this Coast by one of the big
teams in an aetual match, the first
one having been made seven years
ago by Joe Tobin for the Olympics.
After we seemed reasonably sure of
victory the heavy club men got the
ball on the forty-five-yard line,
and in a series of thirteen smashes
forced the Cardinal steadily back
over l.io heavy, muddy field, and
then suddenly, when it seemed like
another buck, Dinsmore slipped i
out round right end, and forced
along by his team mate Varney,
covered the remaining six yards
and ran back of the posts, making
the goal easy for Cadwalader to
kick. The best work was done
near the end of the first half when
the club men had the ball within
our five-yard line. Through a
mistake of the referee, Olympic
was given four trials to make the
last four yards and were stopped
within a foot of the goal line. The
ball was then kicked out of danger j
by Murphy and the half ended with
the ball on our twenty-yard line.
The grounds favored the heavy
club men,who depended almost en
tirely on line bucking.
The best work for Olympic was
done by Varney, Dinsmore, and
Cadwalader. The hitter's kicking
was of a high order and almost
equaled Murphy's in the net dis
tance gained.
The following table was made by
Archie Rice,'9s, of the Han Frati-j
cisco Chronicle.

For Stanford, besides Murphy's
work at quarter, the best work was
done by T. McFadden, at end. and
Fisher and C. McFadden' behind
i he line.
