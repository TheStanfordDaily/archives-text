Tomorrow afternoon every stu
dent will be given the opportunity
of seeing on our own gridiron what
our Varsity can do against the big
Olympic team. There has been a
general demand for Varsity matches
on the campus, and now that Man
ager Berry has succeeded, after the
greatest effort, in bringing one here,
we must all show our loyalty and
appreciation by attending. Then
again, there will be a chance of
showing what kind of support we
can give the Cardinal when we are
all together. Let the rooters make
a record for themselves.
