The death on Saturday of stu
dent Hicks of Berkeley from the
results of an injury sustained while
playing football has cast a deep
gloom over our sister institution
across the hay. We ourselves feel
very deeply over the sad occur
ence. It is indeed to be deplored
that such serious accidents come in
the sport we all love so well, yet we
must not condemn it on that ac
count. They are hound to happen
in any activity, but no more in
football than in hunting or any
other manly sport. When they
come they are almost always re
sults of unavoidable causes, and
their lesson is, not that we should
discontinue sports, but that we
should use the greatest care in
them.

While we are on the subject of
rooting it is necessary to call at
tention to the comment of a Stan
ford alumnus writing the account
of last Saturday's game for the
Chronicle that "not a Stanford yell
enlivened the contest." There were
certainly enough Stanford men
there to at least make themselves
heard, and it seems a shame that
our team did not have the vocifer
ous support of the students in the
plucky game it played against the
Olympic giants, where every con
dition favored our opponents. That
our men did so well without side
line encouragement is all the more
to their credit.
