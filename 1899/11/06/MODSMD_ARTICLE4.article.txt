The regular Sunday sermon was
delivered by Rev. Dwight E. Potter
of Oakland. Hi- suhjeet was taken
from the words of Cain, ''Am 1 My
Brother's Keeper?"' lie said, in
part : " Beyond any question at all,
a man's first and highest duty is to
himself; heyond any question it
would he unutterably hi iter for a
man to think at the close of his life,
' I have wronged myself, I am not
what I might have been.' But a
man's duty does not end hero. We
may live on three different planes.
First, wholly for self, caring noth
ing for others, except for what he
may gain from them ; second, one
may be solicitous for one's fellow
beings, and helpful in all things to
others ; lastly, one may act in his
life the prayer, ' i by kingdom
come,' and completely lose himself
in devotion to the divine ideal.
" Whatever plane of theology we
stand upon, a few things are unde
niable. First, that there is a per
sonal Clod ; second, that (iod has
seen lit to reveal himself through his
law and his prophets ; third, (iod
claims obedience from mankind,
and fourth, the individual is to find
his (iod through his fellow man.
i'he question of whethtr I am my
brother's keeper may be settled on
many grounds. Some say that all
matters of discussion should be set
tled by reason only, and on that
gr und the only conclusion possible
is that 1 am my brother's keeper.
Revelation teems with man's duty
to his neighbor. Jesus said 'man's

lirst obligation Wits to (lod, and liis
second to his fellow man.'
