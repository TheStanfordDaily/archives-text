Those who go on the bleachers
and do not sit in the section that
has been roped off do only half
their duty. To have successful
rooting or singing, the rooters and
singers must be bunched. If they
are scattered, nothing of any real
value can be done. It should not
be expected of the yell leader that
he ask students to sit in this sec
tion. Sit there of your own accord,
and help out a good work.
