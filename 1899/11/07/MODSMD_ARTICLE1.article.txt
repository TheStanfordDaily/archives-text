In last night's practice the second
team showed up with a stronger
line than the Varsity, and forced
the Varsity line back for gains.
Graves and Cairns were out again,
and put up good games. Graves
playing at right tackle on the sec
ond managed to take care of the
two Varsity tackles on the "tackle
over" play. Raitt played a good
end on the second. For the Var
sity, McFadden and Roberts at full
put up a good game. Both Smith

the ball.
