For the first time litis seasc n \v
have witnessed a Varsity game upon
our own campus and the men have
had tlie hem-fit of strong rooting
from the bleacher*. The difficulty
of attending the city games keeps
many away who aie interested in
the team and who would, if pos
sible, he in attendance at the games
to lend their encouragement. This
difficulty is removed, however, when
the games are played on our own
campus; and the way the students
turned out this afternoon showed
that they are still behind the team
and are ready to do their part when
called upon. The game was inter
esting throughout and the players
gave the men on the bleachers every
occasion for good cheering. The
yell leaders have not yet organized
their squads well enough and on
this account the best results of the
yelling cannot be obtained. The
time is short until the Thanksgiv
ing, game and the rooters should
take regular evening practice as
well as those on the field. Another
feature of today's game was the
work of the University Hand. We
have.had few opportunities to hear
the band at the practice games, and
as it! forms a large part of the
Thanksgiving enthusiasm it would
be well if the band could appear
oftener at the evening practices and
thus enable the rooters to practice
with them. This would not only
help the rooters and the players,
but Would be a good means of prac
tice for the members of the band.
