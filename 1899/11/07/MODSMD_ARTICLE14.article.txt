Until the student body treasury
becomes so well filled that a matter
of $500 is too small an item to be
considered against the practice ob
tained by the team in two games
each month, the advocates of cam
pus games will find a valid argu
ment in their economy. It costs
the student body, froi.i figures by the
Treasurer," between $1)00 and $100(i
a month for the two games played

, with the Olympics in the city.
! About half of that is taken in at
J the gate, leaving a deficit danger
j ously near .$5OO for the two games.
In exact figures, the three Olympic
games this season have cost us
$081.50. Rather expensive prac- 1
! tice! In the game today labor can
!he procured for much less, the
Olympics will take their meals at
the training table, and the expense
of renting grounds will be entirely
eliminated. The receipts, of course,
will be less, but the cost in ex
penses will more than offset that.

ert last year left about $1000 more
jin the treasury than it contained
when he took hold of student

student body has undergone from
