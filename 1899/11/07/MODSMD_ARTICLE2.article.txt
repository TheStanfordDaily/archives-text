# Will Go to Monterey.
## 
### 
Manager Berry has received the
sanction of the Executive Commit
tee and of the Faculty to take the
football men to Monterey for the
last week of training. The facili
ties at Congress Springs are not
sufficient for the proper training of
the men, and Monterey was chosen
as the most suitable place. The
team will be taken to the Hotel Del
Monte at Monterey, and the senti
ment of the manager and Execu
tive Committee will be carried out,
that no expense should be spared to
bring the men into proper shape.
The trip to Monterey will cost,
the student body $250 more Mian
a week in the hills, but llie fieili
ties at Del Monte are far superior,
and no pains will be spared at a
time when improper condition can
not be remedied. Had there been
a training-house and facilities for
getting the football squad together
to develop esprit de corps, the men
would have remained on the cam

pus. The cost of the yearly trips
of the team would long ago have
amply fitted out a place where all
the athletic teams of the University
could have trained during their re
spective seasons.
