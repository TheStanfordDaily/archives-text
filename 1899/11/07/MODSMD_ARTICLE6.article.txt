# "THE LITTLE MINISTER."
## President Jordan Selects Barrie's Story from Miss Oliver's Repertoire. 
### 
On next Monday evening the
chapel is expected to contain the
most representative Stanford audi
ence of this or any other season.
The announcement of Katherine
E. Oliver's appearance has awak
ened a widespread interest through
out Palo Alto and the Univer
sity. The choice of the play for
the Stanford engagement being
given President Jordan, he last
evening made the happy selection
of "The Little Minister," Miss
Oliver's dramatization of J. M.
Barrie's beautiful story, Barrie's
work is excedingly popular and
"The Little Minister" is of especial
interest at the present time. With
"The Little Minister" Miss Oliver
scored her first great success. H ers
was the first dramatization of the
book and in 1891 she presented it
in the principal cities of the East
under the management of Major
J. B. Pond of New York, with
phenomenal success. The next
season she gave it in England and
Scotland under the patronage of
leading literary men. Barrie heard
her and was so pleased that he
gave her his support throughout
the season and took her to
"Thrums" where he arranged a re
cital by Miss Oliver of the new
play before his townspeople.
Though Miss Oliver has added
many new performances to her
repertoire since then, her remarka
ble presentation of "The Little
Minister" has probably done more
than anything toward making her
famous, and it is still more popu
lar than ever. Miss Oliver pre
sents the play in two acts and im
personates faultlessly all the char
acters. There is an indescribable
charm in her acting which holds
and fascinates all classes. The
marvel of it all is not so much that
a young woman in a blue evening
gown can transform herself into an
old village doctor, a Scotch house
wife, an auld licht minister, or a
one-eyed London gamin, as that
she can do it without letting the
most critical of audiences see how
and when she does it.
Miss Oliver is not an "elocution
ist," but an impersonator whose
interpretation of "The Little Min
ister" sends away her audience
with a feeling that they have seen
the faces and listened to the voices
of the people in the book. This
attraction is under the auspices of
the Senior Class. Prices of seats
have been reduced to thirty-(1 ve
and twenty-five cents, and the sale
will begin on Wednesday or Thurs
day in Palo Alto and on the cam
nus.
