invitation of r. W. F. Hyde to
meet last evening and discuss the
formation of a choral society in
Palo Alto. It was decided to form
such an organization. Dr. Little
was chosen president, and Mr. W.
F. Hyde secretary-treasurer. The
chorus will meet every Monday
evening, under the leadership of
Mr. Morris.
