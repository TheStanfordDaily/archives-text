We must commend the football
management for their decision
to take the football team to
Del Monte for its last week of
practice before the Thanksgiving
game. Such a trip will be very ex
pensive, and while the whole stu
dent body pays the expenses, there
will be a noticeable decrease in the
surplus at the end of the season be
cause of the trip. We sometimes
wait until the close of the season
to see how much there is left over
with which to begin the next year
before we say that our football man
ager and treasurer have done their
duty. When a balance is made
next year let us remember the
trainer, the trip to Del Monte, and
all of the other good things that
have been done to turn out a vic
torious team of players.
