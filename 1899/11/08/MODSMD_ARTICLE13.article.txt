# College Notes.

### 
—The oldest college in the world
is Mohammand College, at Cairo,
Egypt, which was 1,000 years old
when Oxford was founded. it has
11,000 students.
—The University of Pennsylva
nia has established a Romance
languages seminary. The funds
for the prosecution of the work
were presented by the class of 181)0.
—The faculty of the University
of Chicago has voted to confer the
honorary degree of I>L. I), upon
Admiral Dewey. The tlegree will
not he conferred, however, until his
promised visit to ihat city in 1900.
President Mckinley is the only
other recipient of such an honor
from that university.
—A plan is under consideration
at the University of Chicago look
ing to the transformation of the
Glee Club into a comic opera com
pany, and the Mandolin Club into
an accompanying orchestra. The
reasons for this are the growing
unpopularity of the glee club en
tertainments and failure to make
expenses.
— President Thwing, of Western
Reserve University, in a recent ad
dress to the students of Syracuse
University said: "It is significant
that we call the college not almus
pater but alma mater. She gives
to us intellectual life and cradles
mat life in its feebleness. It is
almost as rare to find a son com
plaining of his college as it is to
find him complaining of his home.
Happy is the man who has two
mothers whom he reverences."
— Beloit has adopted the Honor
System, to insure honest work in
examinations. The main feature
of the system is the judicial com
mittee, consisting of the presidents
of the college classes and two addi
tional members from each of the
two upper classes. This committee
has power to summon and try sup
posed offenders and to determine
the punishment of guilty parties
according to a code. The system
has been in use for only a short
time, but gives promise of success.
—Of the graduating class at
Harvard 405 members have indi
cated their choice of a future pro
fession, and the result must be de
clared to be distinctly depressing
in some particulars, while it is ex- i
hilarating in others. With a sur
plus of lawyers already practicing i
law and running for congress, one |
hundred of those graduates intend
to study law, twenty-nine will re-in-!
force the already crowded ranks of
the medical profession, twelve will
study for the ministry, forty-live!
will teach —until they can find
something more profitable to do—
and business careers of various'
kinds will claim nearly a hundred
more. Twelve of the class expect
to enter journalism, eleven to be
come architects, three are put down '
as intending to enter literature, I
and there is only one artist and j
one musician in tl.e whole 400.—
