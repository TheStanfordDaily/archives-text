Editor Daily Palo Alto:
An effort should be made to have
the Thanksgiving game begin at
1:30 or by 2 o'clock at the latest.
The height and position of the new
covered, western grandstand at the
Sixteenth street grounds are such
that the seats at that side of the
field and the whole gridiron will be
in heavy shadow by 3 o'clock, and
later the eastern seats will also be
visited by the encroaching gloom.
The distance of the grounds from
the heart of the city and the pos
sibilities of discomforts to the
many thousand patrons of the
game should he arguments in favor
of starting the match earlier than
heretofore. Then the public could
get home in reasonable time for
the traditional Thanksgiving din
ner and family reunion, and still
have an opportunity to attend the
theater afterward. If these be not
potent considerations to the aver
age undergraduate a desire for the
best possible conditions for fine
sport should appeal to those who
care only for the contest and ap
preciate what it means to have a
big game prolonged until darkness
makes it difficult to see the plays
and to distinguish the men. These
suggestions are offered in the light
of personal experience of conditions
during nine seasons of intercol
legiate football in San Francisco.
