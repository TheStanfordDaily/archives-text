# LAST NIGHT'S MUSICALE.
## An Account of the Second Monthly Musical Which Was Held in the Chapel. 
### 
Long before tb« time for the con
cert to begin every seat H the
chapel, with the exception of those
in front reserved for the faculty,
was filled and most of the availa
ble standing room was occupied.
The occasion was the appearance
of Mrs. Mary Weaver-McCauley,
soprano; Miss Ada May Churchill,
soprano and pianiste; Mr. Henry
McCauley, tenor robusto; Mr.
Henri Bettman, violinist; and Mr.
Romayne Hunkins, 'celloist.
If there was any fault with the
program itself, it was that it was
even too much varied, with too
many performers.
The opening number was a duet,
''The Unfortunate," by St. Saens,
sung by Mrs. McCauley and Miss
Churchill. In this, as in the fol
lowing "Heaven Hath Shed a
Tear,'' by Kucken, Mrs. McCauley
showed particularly her wide range
and the perfection of her method.
Perhaps the two most enjoyable
numbers to lovers of music were
the trios by Gade. In these in par
ticular, the perfect playing of Miss
Churchill was most apparent. In
these, too,though in a greater degree
in his solo, "Hungarian Fantasia"
by Hubay, Mr. Bettman showed
his marvelous technique. His tone
and expression are not up to his
technical mastery of his instru
ment, which is simply wonderful.
The solo numbers by Mrs. McCau
ley and Miss Churchill were very
well received, especially Mrs. Mc-
Cauley's rendition of "The Lass
with the Delicate Air," "The
Slumber Sea," and the little gem
"Ecstasy." Miss Churchill's sing
ing washy many considered even
more pleasing than Mrs. McCau
ley's on account of the sweetness
and mellowness of her t< nes. Her
"Question," "A Vision," and a
beautiful rendering of Gounod's
"O Divine Redeemer" with 'cello
obligate by Mr. Hunkins, were her
best performances.
The songs by Mr. McCauley, and
Mrs. McCauley's whistling solo va
ried the urogram nleasantlv.
