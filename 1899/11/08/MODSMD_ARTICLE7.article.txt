# The
						Football Rooter.

The following from the Hartford
Courant expresses the general feel
ing regarding rooting in New Eng
land. It is significant, too, that
the Eastern colleges are just begin
ning a practice which has been in
vogue on the Pacific Coast for some
years:
" The New llaven Register an
nounces with apparent authority
that the Vale football scheme this
season includes an organized and
effective 'cheering section,' whose
duty it shall be to whoop up the
situation and carry the game to
success. We had supposed, hereto
fore, that the eleven fellows on the
field of battle were the players of
the game. They have been ham
pered at times in getting their sig
nals by the absurd and barbaric
howling of the 'Breck, Hreck' lun
atics, who have distracted atten
tion of both players and spectators
with their antics and agonies. But
the work has been intrusted to the
elevens. The arm-swinging and
mouth-twisting have been left to
the idiots among the benches.
"It seems that the players are a
failure, and hereafter the battle is
to depend upon the lungs of the
spectators. This is more interest
ing than hopeful, and we still ven
ture to believe that the Register's
important announcement is based
on misinformation. The ridicu
lous performances of the 'rooters'
are the most serious drawbacks to
the athletic games of the college
boys. The racket is unendurable,
and the spectacle of educated gen
tlemen making such obtrusive
asses of themselves is humiliating.
''When any play is made that de
serves admiration you cannot keep
an American crowd from shouting
their approval. Such praise is
spontaneous and worth having, but
steady work at hard-labor pace by
established clacquers has no merit
and does have many objectionable
qualities. It is a real interruption.
It takes the edge off from any gen
uine display of enthusiasm and ap
proval. It confuses the players
and observers and it puts into
places of prominance certain pin
heads whose only real claim to em
inence is that they do not know
enough to keep still.
"Better play the old way with
heads, legs, and arms, and not
with the jaw."
