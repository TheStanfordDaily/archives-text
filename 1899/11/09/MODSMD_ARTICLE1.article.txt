# PRESIDENT GILMAN'S LECTURE
## The 						Noted Lecturer Talks of Stanford University and Its Friends. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the faculty
and students had an opportunity
of listening to I'resideut Oilman of
Johns Hopkins University. The
noted lecturer chose for the subject
of his talk " Reminiscences of
Stanford University's friends."
President Oilman eulogised Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford, saying,
''1 knew Senator Stanford person
ally, and had many very friendly
talks with him. lie was a man
with commanding figure and mod
est bearing." lie said he met
Senator Stanford for the first time
when he (Pres. Oilman) was on
the U. S. Oeological Coi.nnission.
lie went to Senator Stanford to
secure financial help, and the Sen
ator readily gave it, then and at
various times afterward.
President Oilman further said:
"I met Senator Stanford later in
Washington with Andrew 1).
White, when he expressed to me
his one ideal and aim—the build
ing of a great university on the
Pacfic Coast. Several'people urged
upon him to divide his wealth
among several universities, but lie
was steadfast in his sole ambition.
A little later he and Mrs, Stanford
looked for a good man and finally
called upon Dr. Jordan and ob
tained him,"
President Oilman in a very hap
pv manner spoke of this work of
Senator and Mrs. Stanford, saying,
tl l)id they ever make a mistake?
They knew a good thing when they
saw it."
"The University is situated in an
iileal place for study and social
development. Your University has
the finest enclosure of any univer
sity in the country. These build
ings are magnificent. All other
universities have been built by
piece-meal, as money was donated;
here your great University has been
built with the money all at hand.
As a consequence the building has
been on a great scale. We have yet
to see this at Berkeley.
"These great buildings here repre
sent, two things —two things which
aro seldom seen together in such
an institution — inspiration and
study.
"Two great men of the Pacific
Coast are now working together.
One has been here for quite a while,
and the other has just been in
stalled —one at Stanford, and the
other at Berkeley. There will be a
day not far distant when the two
great sister universities will be
working together, and will be spok
en of as Cambridge and Oxford of
England, the beacon lights of the
Pacific Coast.
"I suppose you would like to
know what 1 think of Stanford?
Well, you have a grand collection
of geological and natural history
specimens; a line library; you have
beautiful, quiet, serene, inspiring
nature and perfect environment in
which to wrap yourselves in study;
you have this great State, which
has grown up in the last liftv years
like a mystic being. The State
considers the two universities as
the front of education. The people
here today will some day be scat

tered all over the globe, in various
professions and places. Hut when
you have gone from here you should
keep in mind the inspiring home
of your college days and those who
gave you this opportunity. One
more word. Try to cultivate re
finement, so when you go out into
the world you will lift it up and
not he held down to the common
level of most of your associates.
Help society; do not be afraid to
do something, no matter how small,
towards the uplifting of the race.
Have an ideal, and then try to
reach it. Those that succeed are
those that have worked for some
thing higher. If you do all this,
the State will he better for your
having had a voice in it."
