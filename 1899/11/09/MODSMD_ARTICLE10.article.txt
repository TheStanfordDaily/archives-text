• It is always gratifying when we J
oil our own campus, are able to en
lertain and 1»e entertained by some
artist of real standing. Miss Oliver,
who comes next week, is an Amer
ican girl of wide reputation for her
naturalness, for her simplicity and
power in interpretation, and we ex
tend to her our generous share of
welcome on this her first Western
tour.
Thkhe is something wrong with
the play of the football men, and
the trouble is plainly noticeable
from the side-lines. At this time
of the year, when the men have
been given more frequent practice
as the number of candidates de
creases, we should witness each
night a practice equal in spirit to
any of the early match games; but
the men, besides being slow in ap
pearing for practice, show little
vim or desire to work when on the
field. With the increased activity
from the rooters, which is promised,
there should be an added interest
to the [>ractices on the part of the
players. It was said lust year that
the grandstand was silent because
the men on the field gave no oc
casion for cheering. We should
not allow this statement to be made
again this year, but if the players
and spectators each endeavor to
do their share, the best results will
be gained. From this time on
until the end of the season the
bleachers and side-lines should be
filled with students ready to cheer
at each call of the leader. On the
other hand each man on the field
should put up the best game lie
knows how, even if he does not hear
the responsive yell from the bleach
ers.
