Mordecai entered the University
with the class of 11)01, coming here
from the University of Pennsylva
nia. He had been in poor health
for some time. Six years ago when
his father, Colonel Alfred Mordecai
U. S. A., was in command of
the arsenal at Springfield, Massa
chusetts, Mordecai's health failed,
and he came to California, lie
was benefited by the change and
returned East to enter college.
His father was then transferred to
Benicia, and Mordecai entered
Stanford. At the end of last
semester his health again failed,
and since that time he has been
gradually growing worse, until last
Sunday when the end came.
Mordecai was a member of the
Chi Psi fraternity. lie was a quiet,
studious fellow, who had many
warm friends among both students
and faculty.
