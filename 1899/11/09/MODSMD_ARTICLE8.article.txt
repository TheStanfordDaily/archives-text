Editor Daily Palo Ai.to: — 1
desire to explain a few of the mis
leading statements made in an edi
torial which appeared in the last
issue of the Daily Palo Alto rela
tive to campus games. In the first
place, it is impossible to bring the
Olympic Club team to our campus
to play all preliminary games. The
players cannot neglect their busi
ness for one whole day in the week.
It would be necessary to guarantee
them the same amount as at pres
ent in order to play at all. This
guarantee merely covers the train
ing expenses of the team. In addi
tion it would be necessary to pay
the traveling expenses of the team,
which would offset thoseof our own
team to and from the city. All
that is left to be gained is rental
of ground. This would not be
gained, however, as the leasors ex
pressly refused to give us the
grounds for Thanksgiving and make
the necessary improvements—
amounting to about $7,000 —unless
they would be assured of a lease
which would warrant them in mak
ing such an expenditure. On the
campus the receipts would not
amount to one-third of what they
are in the city. The expenses
would be the same as at present.
I have endeavored to show that
campus games this season are im
practical as well as impossible
with the Olympic team.
Had the writer of the editorial
investigated, he would have found
no necessity to misuse the few facts
he had.
The following is an approximate
estimate:
Expense of city game $425
Receipts of same, last Sunday 200
Deficit $165
Expense for campus games.. $400
Receipts of same (doubtful).. 175
Deficit $225
F. L. Beuky, Mgr.
[ The facts presented in the edi
torial in question were given with
the approval of Mr. Leiter, treas
urer of the Associated Students.
The figures which were taken from
bis report on the receipts and ex
penditures of the various games
showed a deficit of $220 on each of
the city games and of $85 on the
campus game. There was no in
tention to misquote facts. Our in
formation was taken from the
treasurer, whom we believed to lie
good authority on the subject.
The whole purpose of the editorial
was to interest the student body in
campus games in order that our
campus facilities may be so in
creased that such games may not
only be carried on without serious
loss to the student body treasury,
but that they mav ultimately be
come self supporting.— Ed ]
