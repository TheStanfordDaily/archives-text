Numkrous complaints have lately
been made of the loss of articles by
students. It is a traditional rule
of college that anything found
should be left, at the Registrar's of
fice instead of being pocketed by
the finder. Freshmen, of course,
cannot be expected to learn so
many things in half a semester and
the recent losses may perhaps he ac
credited to their ignorance. An
observance of the rule in the future,
however, may avoid a great deal of
trouble and inconvenience.
