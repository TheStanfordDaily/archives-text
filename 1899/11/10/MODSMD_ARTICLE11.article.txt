Tomorrow afternoon our Varsity
will meet the University of Nevada
team for the first time, and an in
teresting game should result. The
Nevada team has improved greatly
under Dickson's coaching and is
ahle to put up a fast game from
start to finish. The game is one
which they have looked forward to
all season and the}' will come down
tomorrow with a determination to
win. The muddy grounds will favor
our opponents, if any one, as they
will interfere with the work of our
light hacks. As was said a hove,
the Varsity must not expect an
easy game, but the University ex
pects a victory and the team should
not allow it to he disappointed.
