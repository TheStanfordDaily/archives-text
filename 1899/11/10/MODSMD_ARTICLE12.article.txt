Tins evening and tomorrow even
ing the first general debating events
of the college year are to lie held in
the chapel —the semi-finals for the
selection of Stanford's three repre
sentatives in the intercollegiate
Carnot debate. At this time, when
football is the all-absorbing object
of student interest and speculation,
we are apt to forget the importance
which debating will assume after
the Thanksgiving game. Jt was
one of the characteristics of our
old debating system that the choos
ing of intercollegiate debaters was
put off until the last part of the
semester when other things are out
of the way. Last year, however,

the new plan was initiated of inter
esting a greater number of partici
pants, and for that purpose semi
finals were held early in the year.
The effect was immediate, both in
the number of debaters brought out
and in the general interest aroused.
The only question about the suc
cess of our system is its endurance.
Whether the foundation laid last
year for the development of inter
collegiate debaters is to be secured
and added to this season, is a ques
tion which rests to a great extent
with the student body at large to
determine. Debating, as any stu
dent institution, must be supported
by non-participants to attain a full
measure of success. Men cannot
talk to empty chairs a whit more
successfully than can a football
team play with energy before silent
bleachers. What debating needs,
to be successful this year, is a gen
eral interest among the students —
not merely a passive interest, a
knowledge that there is such a
thing as a Stanford debating sys
tem, but an energetic, active inter
est which will bring them out to
debating events. Right now, at
the very opening of the season, is
when this interest is most necessary
and when its presence or absenae
may make or mar an intercollegiate
victory. The chapel should l>e
filled this evening and tomorrow.
Let our debaters know they have
our support.
