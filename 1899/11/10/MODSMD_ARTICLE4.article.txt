# VARSITY vs. NEVADA.
## Stanford Plays an Outside University for the First Time in Several Years. 
### 
Tomorrow the Varsity lines
up against the University of Nev
ada eleven. This team is a de
cided advance over last year's. It
defeated Santa Clara by a score of
1 l-G, with Sheehy and Coward, of
the Olympics, and Regan of the
Denver Athletic Club, in the col
ege line. The eleven also defeated
tlie University*of Pacific, 63-5. In
this game Kidder, the Nevada
quarter, made a punt of 70 yards.
The team is being coached by
Dickson of Pennsylvania, and has
made rapid improvement under
him.
Last year a scrub eleven was
sent to Nevada after the Thanks
giving game and was defeated by
the University team, '22-0.
The Varsity line will probably
be: McFadden, 1. e.; Burnett, 1. t.;
Huston, 1. g.; Oilman, Hayden,
centers; l)e Forest, r. g.; Hentley,
r. t.; Parker, r. e.; Murphy, quar
ter; Smith, 1. h.; Fisher, r. h.;
C. McFadden, full.
The changes are Burnett at
tackle in place of Dole, who is laid
off with a sprained ankle, and
Oilman, who will play part of the
game in the center position. The
game will be called promptly at
3:30 p.m.
Last night's practice was one of
the slowest that has been held for
some time. The men were on the
field earlier than usual, but when
lined up they played in a careless
sort of way which was anything
but interesting to the spectators.
The best work for the varsity was
the line bucking of C. McFadden
and Fisher's running with the ball.
For the Second, Cooper, Emerson,
and Oilman in the line were par
ticularly noticeable. The Second
was weak on the defensive, espe
cially behind the line.
The following is the line-up:
