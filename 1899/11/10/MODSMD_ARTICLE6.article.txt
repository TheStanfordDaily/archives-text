ahout fifty seats unsold. The chapel
will all he reserved except the row
of seats along the baek wall, and a
limited number of general adniis

sion tickets will be sold at the
door for these. Miss Oliver in as
sured of n fine audience, and a
splendid welcome. Miss Oliver is
the best of a small group of monolo
gists who have developed an art far
above that of the multitude of
" readers" and ''entertn inert*." Ikr
performance is described marvel
ous. It is considered an achieve
ment to consistently play one part
through an entire play ; this young
woman plays the entire cast of
characters, and impersonates them
so vividly and distinctly that it is
hard to realize that she is alone
upon the platform, and not sur
rounded by the living, breathing
people of the book, ller work is
delightfully unaffected and free
from mechanics and artificiality.
She is, for the moment, the charac
ter she impersonates. Miss Oliver's
method is one of absolute simplic
ity, and in that simplicity lies its
chief charm. The Btory is not
overtold. The audience is held
absolutely from the first to
the last scene, and leaves with
the feeling that it has seen an
entire company of players in one,
and that this young woman of mod
est yet confident presence is one of
the truest artists of our time.
