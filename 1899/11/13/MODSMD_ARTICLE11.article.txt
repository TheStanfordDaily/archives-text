# Addition to the Museum.

The University library recently
received from Due de Loubats, of
Paris, France, a very valuable
copy of an old Mexican manu
script. Librarian Nash has sent
it to the museum, which affords
better facilities for keeping it than
the library. The book consists of a
long narrow slip of parchment,
mounted between wood covers so as
to conveniently fold. It is filled
with hieroglyphics which are in
beautiful colors, making the book
look more like a child's picture
book than a valuable manuscript.
Two years ago Due de Loulmts
sent a somewhat similar book to
the library.
