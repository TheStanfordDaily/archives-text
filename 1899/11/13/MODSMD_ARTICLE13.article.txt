### 
The Carnot semi-final prelimina
ries were held in the chapel last
Friday and Saturday evenings. On
Friday night there were seven con
testants : J. E. Wilson, '01; C. F.
Bidwell, '00; L. B. Wilson, '00; E.
T. Maples, '01; E. I). Holly, '00; J.
F. English, '01, and E. S. Page, '00.
The speakers on the following night
were: M. C. Decarli, '00; C. M. Mar
rack, '01; W. A. iMorris, '01; Charles
Quayle, '00; W. M. Edlin, '02; F.
J. Cummings, 01; C. H. King, '01;
Miss Anna (i. Eraser, '00, and E.
W. Dickson, '00.
After the second debate on Sat
urday evening the judges, Profes
sors Fetter, Ross, and Newcomer,
retired, and chose Edlin, English,
Miss Eraser, Marrack, Quayle, and
L. B. Wilson to contest with Hay
den, '00, and Springer, '00, who
were exempted from the semi-finals
because of their having been on the
Carnot debate last year. From
these eight this year's Carnot team
will be chosen, the finals to be held
early in December.
The debates this year were char
acterized by greater merit than ob
tained in semi-final debates of last
year. The interest showed in the
debates in 1898 has had its result,
and the improvement is decidedly
encouraging.
