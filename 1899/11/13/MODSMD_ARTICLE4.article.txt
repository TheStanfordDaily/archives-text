Rabbi Voorsang-er Delivers a Strong
Address on Influence of tko
World's Greatest Skeptic.
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger delivered
the address in the chapel Sunday
morning. 11 is subject was, "Robert
Ingersoll and the Bible.'' In part
he said; "The death of an eminent
citizen is always a loss to the com
monwealth. Viewed from the stand
point of public service the people,
unlike the proverbial corporation or
republic, gratefully remembers the
individual who has been one of its
tribunes and whose utterances or
deeds have exalted the aims of a
nation; whose position as the inter
preter of public aspirations has
ci mmended him to the esteem and
the affection of the multitude.
"ingersoll was in our terse, Amer
ican-English, what we would call a
clean man; his character was clean,
his morals were those of a man of
religious convictions; his conduct
was becoming a citizen whose con
ceptions of duty were high and
noble. 11 is nature, indeed, was
thai of a man designed to personify
the greatest good that benefits so
ciety. Why was this good man
such an inveterate enemy of re
vealed religion, such a blasphemer
of the (iod of Scripture, and why did
he denounce the Bible to his audi
ences as the most incompetent man
ual of moral guidance with which
they could be entrusted? I believe
that Ingersoll's attitude was largely
due to circumstances. For one
thing, Ingersoll was the type of an
interrogatorâ€”a cross-examiner. He
addressed religion with the legal
functions of his profession, and lie
was strictly within his right. But
you cannot teach religion by' the
same methods by which evidence is
sifted and determined before a jury,
and you cannot find l.ioJ, of whom
human nature is a part, by using
the retorts of the chemist or apply
ing the theories of the mathemati
cian. Ingersoll represents an army
of in'telligent people whose ques
tions cannot lie met with a frown,
with a threat, anathema, or with a
simple declaration of authority.
He is the incorporated skeptic; the
man who asserts that thinking and
deciding for himself is asserting an
inalienable and constitutional right
Who will cavil at that assertion?
Not 1. who am a member of a Pro
testant minority of the human
race. I justify Ingersoll's right to
ask questions. To deny it would
implicate us :is unfaithful to the
principles we have professed since
immemorial times.
"Presenting himself as a type of
i he intern>gator,l ngersoll demanded
to know why the opinion of man
should always bow to the authority
of tradition. I'roclaimiug himself
to be a seeker after truth he entered
into polemics with the church as a
method of determing the validity
of its authority. He claimed that
the Bible gave him no such message
:is it had preached since the begin
ning of history and he demanded
an answer to bis questions. Was
be answered? He was simply told,
'He that believe!h not shall be
damned.' His interrogations were
met with abuse. This may explain,
though hardly justify, the intempe

rate language in which Ingersoll
addressed his interrogators. A man
of integrity, a man of action, he
lost a valid cause when he became
a literary brute. Assuming the jus
tice of his cause, granting his full
right of inquiry, yielding him the
palm of honesty, why was he so
fearfully, awfully brutal when he
attacked God and the .Bible? lie
cause, failing to see God in the
Scriptures, he utterly and entirely
mistook its spirit. This Book of
Books cannot be approached by the
brutal methods that obtain in
police-court examinations. It suited
Ingersoll to extract from the Bible
its literature of miracles and folk
lore, and to contend that this, and
this alone, made the Book unsuit
able as a teacher of Occidental mor
ality. Admitting that he sought
after God, had he no resources but
legends that sprung from the mind
of man when that man was but a
child?
"The church holds to doctrines
which few accept, except in theory.
Its exponents, often enough, defend
the integrity of statements which,
in the privacy of thought and
study, they most heartily condemn.
It is this public defense of unten
able statements that produces In
gersolls.
"Let the church, then, be more
tolerant. Let it consent to a re
classification of the evidences of
Holy Writ, to a plain statement of
its evolutionary tendencies. Let it
consent to a study of the text with
out tlx' bias of a commentary, pro
nounced by it as imbued with di
vine authority. Let it do this and
the time will come when an Inger
soll will be impossible.
"Ingersoll erred most in this,
that he could not find God. He
demanded, stubbornly, that author
ity should acknowledge that an
ancient conception had been palmed,
off on humanity. If he could not
find God in the good he doubtless
achieved; if there was no God in
Nature or in all the grand motives
that make our lives noble, beauti
ful and helpful, then he was an un
happy man, indeed; and even now
his soul must be groping in the
darkness of an eternal night that
knows no breaking."
