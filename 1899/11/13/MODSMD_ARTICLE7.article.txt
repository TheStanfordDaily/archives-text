Saturday's game with the Uni-j
versity of Nevada team was prob- j
ably the most interesting game
which we have played this season.
The men played good ball, espe
cially in the second half, and showed
that they were capable of putting
lip a good game when necessary.
The scarcity of injuries is another
indication of the excellence of this
year's training system. If the men
continue practice with the same
spirit as was shown Saturday, we
have no reason to be alarmed about
the game they will play next
Thanksgiving.
