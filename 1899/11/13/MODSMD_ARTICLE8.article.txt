Although defeated by our team
on Saturday, the Nevada Univer
sity boys are to be congratulated
on the game fight they made against
a team of greater experience. They
showed the true spirit, and we are
sincerely glad to have met them as
antagonists on the gridiron, and to
welcome them as friends and fellow
students to our University. They
come bringing to us the good will
of their institution, a good will
which we greatly prize, and we wish
to extend to them the hospitality
of Stanford. We see no reason
why the relations of the student
bodies of the two universities can
not be enlarged, and we hope some
means will be arranged by which
they may.
