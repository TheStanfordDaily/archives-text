We have no reason whatever to
he discouraged over the result of
the California-Olympic game in
San Francisco on last Saturday.
To he sure, California put up a
brilliant game, hut then they were
expected to do so. They undoubt
edly have the strongest eleven in
their history, and we undoubtedly
have a real hard proposition to
face. But it is a hard fight that
we are after, and that the twenty
thousand people who will go to the
game are after. It is not likely
that Berkeley's team can improve

over its form of last Saturday, but
it is certain our team will put up a
contest on Thanksgiving day greatly
superior to any they are capable of
now. Our duty is plain and abso
lutely vital. Let every student and
member of the faculty stop asking
the question, " Do you think there
is any chance for us ?" and use his
or her influence in a positive way
towards building up the most sys
tematic support that we ever gave
a team. He is a traitor to his col
lege who shows the least tinge of
white feather at this critical time,
for a faint heart succeeds now no
more than in the days of chivalry.
The bare question of winning now
should have no place in our
thoughts. We have but to do our
best, and then after the game is
over there will be no " it might have
beens," and our consciences will be
clear in the satisfaction of having
done our very best.
