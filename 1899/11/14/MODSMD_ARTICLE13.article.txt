The completion of the Memorial
Chapel will end the several memo
rials to her son which Mrs. Stan
ford has desired to see. It is no
hardship for those who possess
more than the average to part with
their money, but to take upon
one's self the responsibility of an in
stitution such as our University, to
interest one's self in iis least detail,
to manage as large an interest as
the Stanford estate, to toil for the
interests of others merely because
the} 7 are fellow creatures, demands
a rare combination of those liner
sensibilities which make life what
it is, with pure business ability.
Our Museum, Memorial Arch, and
Chapel will be as eloquent of Mrs.
Stanford's womanliness as the Uni
versity itself will he a tribute to
the ability of its founders.
