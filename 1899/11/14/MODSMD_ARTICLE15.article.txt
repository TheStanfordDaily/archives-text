The Executive Committee of the
Inter-Society Debating League, hav
ing in charge the finals for the
Carnot preliminaries, is experienc
ing difficulty in determining the
method to he pursued in this try
out. In choosing a team to repre

sent us in this intercollegiate con
test we want the men who will
make the best showing at that time,
and it would seem that the best
method of choosing the men would
he to put them on a test similar to
j the final contest. Some men can
make a better showing in im
promptu speaking than others who
gain more with plenty of time for
preparation. The team should,
therefore, be chosen from those who
make the best appearance on a test
corresponding with the final debate.
