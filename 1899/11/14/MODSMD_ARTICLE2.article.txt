# Golf Course Improvements.
## 
### 
During the past fortnight the
work of repairing the golf course
has progressed rapidly. Until
lately the dryness of the ground
has delayed work on the greens,
but since the recent rains the home
green has been built up nearly level,
the task of building the '"(.'rag"
begun, and all the oilier greens
smoothed off. The fair green of
the course now consists of short
grass, which supports a ball very
well, and gives a chance fur many
brassie shots. In order to make
the approach more difficult and
lofting necessary, a bunker in the
form of ditches and a hank of
earth has been laid across the line
of play at the " canyon hob-." It
this serves its purpose similar ones
will be built at the first and sev
enth greens.
The heavy University roller is
being used on the whole course in
an attempt to smooth out the foot
prints which the horses make after
every rain, but the surface can
never be kept in good order, or a.
good lie for the ball assured, while
horses are kept, in the pasture.
