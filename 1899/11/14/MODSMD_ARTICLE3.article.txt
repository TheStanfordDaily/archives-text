# Shipment of Palo Alto Horses.
## 
### 
Six palace horse-care, HI led with
horses from the Stuck Farm, left for
the Kast this afternoon. The ship

meat comprises ull of the thorough
breds on the ranch —fifty-six in
number—and twenty-six head of
young trotting stock. Among the
thoroughbreds are Flambeau,
and Racine, both of which
held the world's record at one time,
and Fairy Rose, one of the most
famous dams ever bred. The most
promising of the trotting stock is
Elmo, a yearling who recently
worked out a quarter in 37 seconds.
The horses will be sold at public
sale on November 24th at Madison
Square Warden, New York. Graves,
'01, who made a good showing as
guard in (he football teams, has left
the University and will go East as
assistant in taking care of the
horses. No more thoroughbreds
will be raised on the Stock Farm,
as Mrs. Stanford has decided that
trotting stock only shall be bred.
