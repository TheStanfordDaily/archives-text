# "THE LITTLE MINISTER."
## Miss Katharine E. Oliver Gives an Example of Her Great Art as a Monologist. 
### 
Practically every seat for Miss
Oliver's recital was sold, so a
large audience greeted her appear
ance on the chapel stage last night.
Professor Pease introduced Miss
Oliver to her hearers in a felici
tous little speech, and with a few
words of introduction she started
simply into the story of the Little
Minister.
The first thing that impressed
those who heard her was the ex
treme simplicity of her manner
and the melodic sweetness of her
voice. Dr. Jordan's choice of the
play to lie presented was a most
happy one, yet it left a desire to
know what she would do in any
other selection that could be half
so charming.
Her arrangement of the story
was very good and showed unity
and proportion, beginning with the
scene in the village square at the
time of the weaver's riot, where
Babbie, the heroine, incites the
weavers to resist the soldiers,against
the admonitions of the little minis
ter, Gavin Dishart. Following this
scene and the subsequent escape of
Babbie from the soldiers with the
minister, came, perhaps, the most
amusing scene of the play: the
halting of the minister in the
church over the chapter of Ezra.
A pathetic part and one calculated
to show Miss Oliver's skill came in
the scene in Nanny Webster's home
—"They are takin' me to the puir
house —dinna let them!"
The very best scenes were those
between Babbie and Gavin, where
all the naturalness and sympathy
of Miss Oliver's art had its best
chance to show, though there are
many who will contend that the
scene between Babbie and Micah
Dow, son of Rob Dow, displayed
the most clever acting. Particu
larly powerful was the scene in
Caddam wood, of Rob Dow's re
venge.
But through it all there was no
sense of acting, no theatrical
method, none of the tricks of the
stage, livery listener came away
with an abiding picture of the
characters represented, for Miss
Oliver lived them all.
