The management of the 1901
Quad is experiencing much diffi
culty in collecting the class assess
ment. There seems to be a general
desire on the part. of many mem
bers of the class to dodge the col
lectors. Handicapped as the man
agement is by the heavy class debt,
it must be assured of more than
the usual number of assessments
before it can begin arrangements
for the publication of the volume.
As planned by the editorial board,
this volume of the Annual promises
to be one of the very best yet is
sued. It will be a much more
elaborate and ambitious book than
any yet attempted, and a large
amount of money will be necessary
to guarantee its publication.
Collectors have been appointed
and a determined effort will be
made to collect as large a sum as
possible this semester. Every mem
ber of the class who has not yet
paid his assessment is urged to do
so as soon as possible.
