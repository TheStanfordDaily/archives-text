# Report on the Branding of Young Seals.
## 
### 
The most complete report upon
tlif fur sea Is, fishes, and bird lift; of
the l'rihilof islands that has yet
been issued by President Jordan <jf
the Seal Commission has been re
reived from the United Slates
Treasury Department at Washing
ton.
This was the long-delayed third
volume report. The hook contains
twenty-four articles hy as many
different authorities upon seals,
with ninety-five full-plate illustra
tions an.d maps. Perhaps the most
interesting discussion of the whole
hook is the full description of the
branding processes tried on those
islands, the corralling of the seals,
and the effect of confining them
upon, their ha hi t nt i .ns, written by
President David Starr Jordan.
"Various methods were tried in
regard to the work," Dr. Jordan
said, ''the experiments dating back
some years. It was found that
driving them into an enclosure, or
small fenced lake, and keeping
them there, disturbed them very

little. For the tirst few days they
| tried to escape, but after that they
! settled down to their new circle of
life with apparently little or no
dissatisfaction.
"Only the young female seals
were branded, and in these first
j experiments the iron was so made
that it did not destroy the furs or
cut through the skin, leaving a
scar. The experiments were en
tirely successful in that the seals
were not. frightened away from
their rookeries, nor were any of
them destroyed by the branding,
only four deaths having occurred
as a direct result.
"It is to be hoped that neither
the branding nor herding the seals
may be necessary in future as a
means for the protection of the fur
seals, but in case such measures are
necessary, we desire to call atten
tion to the fact that such plans are
entirely feasible, and that, sys
tematically carried out, they fur
nish a means of doing away with
pelagic sealing, or at least of so seri
ously crippling it as to make its
abandonment certain."
