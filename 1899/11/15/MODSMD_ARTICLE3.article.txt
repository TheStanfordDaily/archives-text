Dr. Jordan greeted the audience
i n the elm pel last night and gave the
main part of the lecture before the
lights were extinguished and the
calcium thrown on the screen. lie
made some witty comparisons be
tween the Swiss Alps and the Sierra
Nevada, and entered into a popu
larized geological history of both,
lie told of the work of the Sierra
Club, which has many Stanford
members, in exploring and naming
the peaks of the Sierras in the
neighborhood of Kings River; and
of the naming of Mt. Stanford, one
of the highest; of Mt. Jordan, and
many others. He kept his hearers
in almost continuous laughter with
many anecdotes and incidents of
mountain travel.
He then gave way to Professor
Brown who, from a greater familiar
ity with the country, could better
describe the pictures —a somewhat
difficult task in some instances, as
a number of the pictures were very
similar. Professor Brown described
each picture, giving some reminis
cence connected with each. These
stereopticon views were wonderfully
good, and particularly beautiful
were those taken on the floor of the
canyon, with the big trees and run
ning water.
