# LAST NIGHT'S PRACTICE.
## Varsity and Second Hold a Close Practice on the Oval. Murphy Will Be Out in a Week. 
### 
The Varsity and second eleven
lined up for a sharp practice on the
oval last night. The second put up
a good game, twice blocking the
Varsity's punts. The line bucking
was good, the second at first going
through the Varsity for gains, but
were finally stopped up. Allen,'o3,
who had his collarbone broken early
in the season, was out last night for
the first time since his accident.
He was tried at half on the second.
Smith was laid off after the first
few plays and Hough was substi
tuted. Rice, McFadden and Parker
were tried at end. "Babe" Burnett
put up a fine game at tackle.
C. McFadden, who was injured
in the Nevada game, is gaining
rapidly, and will probably be out
in two weeks. Captain Murphy is
still laid up, but will be out in a
week.
