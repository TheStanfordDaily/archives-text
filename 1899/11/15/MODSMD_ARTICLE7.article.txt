# The 						Thanksgiving "Chaparral."
## 
### 
The regular dates for the next
two issues of the Chaparral are
November 16th and December 7th,
making Thanksgiving fall between
tlie two (lutes, and two weeks from
the nearest publication day to the
day of ihe game. Therefore the
issue for tomorrow has been post
poned a week, so that it will be
more timely, though the next num
ber after the game will come on the
regular date. This football and
Thanksgiving number will eclipse
anything of the kind ever gotten
out at the University. There will
be a double-page drawing by Cul
ver, '09, pronounced by many the
best college drawing that he has
ever made. He and Larry Bow
man and Bristow Adams have a
large number of other drawings,
milking it the most diversified and
copiously illustrated issue yet.
There will also be half-tone inserts
of Captain Murphy and "Babe"
Burnett. The reading matter will
give a number of humorous write
ups, including the Blug Ugly,
tbe Freshman Came, and Quart
Bottles and Side-Board Lights,
by "Chas. A. Flitmore." There
will be a number of new football
jokes, and a liberal sprinkling of
light verse.
