## California Defeats Nevada by a Score of 24-0—Final Preliminary Games Saturday. 
### 
Yesterday's game between the
California and Nevada teams re
sulted in a victory for the former,
by a score of 24-0. On account of
the heavy rain the field was in a
poor condition and interfered with
the rapid play upon which the Ne
vada men depended for their gains.
Nevada's play was considerably im
proved over last Saturday's, the
team having picked up in the prac
tices which were held here with the
Stanford men.
The California boys had the best
of the game throughout, owing to
their superior weight and experi
ence. Nevada was unable to pierce
the heavy line of their opponents
and depended mainly on Keddie's
kicking for their gains. The guards
back play was used repeatedly by
Nevada, but seldom netted a gain.
The punting was good on both
sides, Kaarsberg having a slight
advantage over Keddie.
One of the features of the game
was Kaarsberg's passing the ball
back when tackled, always gaining
several yards by the trick. Nevada
tried none of her trick plays used
last Saturday, but depended en
tirely on straight line plunges. For
Nevada the best work was done by
Keddie, Sunderland, Evans, and
Moran. For California the work of
Womble, Pringle, Kaarsberg, and
Hall was the most noticeable.
Following is a summary of the
best plays:
Longest runs —By Hall, 11,46,
20, 13 yards; by Kaarsberg, 33, 13,
10, 20, 27, 11, 10 yards; by Smith,
31 yards; by Womble, 30 yards; by
Pringle, 30 yards; by More, 24
yards —all of California.
Punts —Keddie of Nevada, 35,
13, 36, 35, 28, 23, 21, 33, 43, 20, 16,
35, 26 yards; Kaarsberg of Califor
nia, 41, 43, 35, 26, 42, 41 yards.
The team from the University of
Oregon will arrive in Berkeley this
evening and will play the Univer
sity of California next Saturday.
The Oregon boys were recently de
feated by the Multnomah Club, but
have improved in their play and
will put up an interesting game
Saturday.

The practice last night was slow

on account of the poor condition of
the field. Rain was falling during
the practice and handicapped the
work of the men.
