The San Francisco papers are
doing their best to impress upon
us the fact that we have absolutely
no chance to win the football cham
pionship this year. Every time
California wins a victory the pros
pective score of the Thanksgiving
game grows. After the Berkeley-
Olympic game last Saturday it was
prophesied as 35 to 5, and now,
when the Oalifornians defeat the
Nevadas, the Thanksgiving score
mounts to 40 to 0. This is not the
most encouraging outlook for us,
but somehow we are not daunted.
As the prophecies that the city pa
pers are so fond of making grow
gloomier, the work on the field grows
stronger. Even the hard luck we
have experienced this last week has
not left us entirely spiritless. On
the contrary, it has aroused in us
every particle of college spirit we
have, everything that is best in the
Stanford spiritâ€”a feeling that no
matter what the score may be, even
if it goes beyond the dizzy lengths
that have been predicted, we shall
still stand by the team, cheering
them to the last scrimmage. The
most encouraging thing to a team
is to feel that it has the unbounded
support of the student body behind
it. Now is the time, of all times,
for every man, and woman too, in
the University, to let that team feel
that the student body has confi
dence in it, and in its ability to
win. If we win, the more the glory.
If we lose, the team wili still feel
behind it the moral support of
every man and woman here.
