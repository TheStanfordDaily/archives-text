# BERKELEY'S CAPTAIN BARRED.
## Whipple Has Been Ruled Out by Faculty Action for Deficiencies in Scholarship. 
### 
Captain Whipple, Berkeley's star
tackle, has been definitely barred
from football by the action of the
faculty on account of deficiencies in
scholarship. Clay will probably
take his place. lOilis, who was one
of the stn ngest aspirants for quar
ter-back's position and who played
the star game of the day against
Olympics last Saturday, has been
barred for professionalism, having
been a paid coach for Nevada.
Captain Whipple lias been un
fortunate this season, having re
ceived an injury about four weeks
ago which has prevented him from
taking part in any of the practices
or preliminary games. He had
just returned to the field and taken
up his position at tackle again
when the faculty ruling came de
barring him from the game. The
usual opportunity of making up
deficiencies in scholarship will be
granted and Captain Whipple may
yet be in the game if he succeeds
in bringing his scholarship up to
the required standing. This is the
first instance in the history of in
tercollegiate football where a Berke
ley player has been debarred on
account of bad scholarship.
