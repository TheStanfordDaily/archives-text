# Millions for the University.

Today's Call con tains further news
concerning the transfer of Mrs.
Stanford's wealth to the endowment
fund of the University. Mrs. Stan
ford has just sold 285,000 shares of
Southern Pacific stock to the Hunt
ington-Sneyer syndicate at $40 a
share. She still retains 20,000
shares, which she can readily sell
for $800,000. From her Central
Pacific holdings, Mrs. Stanford
realized about $820,000.
The sale of the Market-street
Railway stock netted her $1,500,-
000; and,according to the Call, this,
together with the proceeds of the
Central Pacific stock, has been con
veyed to the endowment fund.
Mrs. Stanford's one-fourth inter
est in the Pacific Improvement
Company, which she has retained,
is worth at least $7,000,000.
The Southern Pacific stock, which
has just been sold, was presented to
the University, prior to Mrs. Stan
ford's departure for Europe, with
the understanding that she should
be allowed to sell it whenever she
could advantageously. The stock,
although very valuable, was pro
ductive of no income, and thus
could work no good materially to
the University. Now that the stock
has been converted into money, the
widespread improvements which
have been contemplated for so long
will be realized.
