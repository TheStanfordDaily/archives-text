Th ' west side of Lasuen row bids
fair to be the prettiest row on the
campus. Mrs. Stanford has set it
aside for the use of fraternities, and
already two handsome structures
have been erected. The Phi Delta
Theta's home, built in the quaint
old Spanish style, and the Kappa
Kappa Gamma's picturesque Eng
lish cottage, make handsome addi
tions to the campus buildings.
Mrs. Stanford favors strongly the
building of fraternity homes on the
campus, feeling that students in
this way come closer in touch with
the real University life and spirit.
Two more fraternities are waiting
Mrs. Stanford's return in order to
begin building, and if their homes
are as pleasing, from an architec
tural point of view, as the two just
finished, Mrs. Stanford will have
cause to be proud of Fraternity
row.
