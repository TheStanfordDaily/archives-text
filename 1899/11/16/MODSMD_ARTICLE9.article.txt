The magazine reading tables in
Encina clubroom are for some rea
son not so carefully looked after as
they have been in past years. For
merly all of the leading periodicals,
professional and collegiate, ap
peared on the tables at the time of
issue, but this year many of the
most sought for are missing, or
their appearance is very late. Nota
bly the comic journals are conspic
uous by their general absence and
state of dilapidation. A large part
of the fault is due to the careless
ness of the readers, but there cer
tainly seems to be some fault with
the management. Even now the
stiff slip-covers for the monthly pe
riodicals are reposing in neglect in
a third-floor storeroom. The col
lege periodical tables are, too, for
some reason, as compared to last
year, ill-supplied with the rep
resentative college journals, and
such as are there are clipped and
disfigured. This state of affairs
should certainly be remedied by
the board of directors of the club
)
through the committee that is sup

posed to take charge of this branch
of entertainment. Since most of
the revenues of the club are ex
pended for these magazine tables,
it seems that such action should
be taken as would make this ex
penditure fully worth while.
