# TOMORROW'S GAME.
## The
						Last Scheduled Game Before the Intercollegiate Match. 
### 
The Varsity lines up against the
Olympic team tomorrow for the
last scheduled game before the in
tercollegiate contest The club men
have twice defeated the Stanford
team, the first time by a score of
6to 5, and the second 10 to 5. In
tomorrow's game Murphy will he
unable to play, and the team will
be without its best punter, but the
men should put up a good game.
California defeated the Olympics
last Saturday 15 to 0, playing her
best game this season on a very
muddy field. If Stanford puts up
as good football as the teams have
shown in practice, the game to
morrow will not be one-sided.
The game will be called at 3
o'clock at the Sixteenth street
grounds.
The probable line-up of the two
teams will be as follows :
Varsity. Olympic.
Rice 1 end r. . . . Hamilton
Bentley 1 tackle r ... .Sheehy
DeForest .. .1 guard r .... Fickert
Hayden center Monroe

Boren full Atkinson
Substitutes — Erb, Hough, Oil
man, Lee, Raitt, Caches.
The practice last night was one
of the sharpest held this season.
The men went into the plays lierce
-1)' and played good, strong ball.
The backs on both teams were
charged several times during the
practice. If the same kind of play
is kept up next week there will be
more than a lighting chance for the
intercollegiate game.
Oilman was tried at guard on
the second for the first time and
played that position better than
center. Treager put up a go d
game at tackle. Allen was again
tried at half on the Varsity, but
sprained his ankle, Nourse being
substituted.
At signal practice held in the
gymnasium last night Erb was
tried at quarter on the Varsity arid
Rodolph at full. De Forest was
tried at punting and showed up
fairly well. Mis kicking is strong,
though not accurate.
Following is the line-up:
Varsity. Second.
