With the widening of the paths
to Palo Alto there lias come the
suggestion that the positions of pe
destrian and cycle paths be re

versed. The advantages claimed
for the new plan are that there is a
more direct route for pedestrians
from the walk from the railroad
tracks, without a crossing-over at
the University gates, where the cy
clists have to cross from the road
to their present side of the avenue.
This crossing of cyclers' and walk
ers' routes as at present would he
avoided under the new scheme, and
each class could go on its respective
way without interference and con
sequent danger from the others.
At the University end, with the
four divergent roads there need he
no trouble, and it is probable that
the use of the east side of the path
for pedestrians, especially with the
new Library in use, will be the
more convenient when the final ar
rangement of the University's fa
cade is made.
