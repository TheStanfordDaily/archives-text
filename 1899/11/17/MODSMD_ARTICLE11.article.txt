The action of the Athletic Com
mittee last night in deciding upon
an emblem for intercollegiate track
men is one which should meet with
unqualified approval. We believe
in some recognition of every one
who wears the cardinal in any of
our annual contests with Berkeley.
A track man has to win a point to
receive the Varsity ''S,' 1 and those
who are not thus fortunate, no mat
ter how conscientiously they may
have worked, have heretofore gone
unrecognized. The new emblem for
unsuccessful intercollegiate compet
itors, while not at all taking from the
honors of the point winner, will add
to those attainable by track men in
general, and give a stronger incen
tive to track work among under
class men. This is especially desir
able, since it has been complained
that these men do not come out be
cause of the impossibility of their
being point winners. That it is the
under-class track man who makes
the intercollegiate victor as a junior
or a senior is, however, too well
established as a rule to need com
ment. To bring these under-class
men out, this emblem should be
most successful.
