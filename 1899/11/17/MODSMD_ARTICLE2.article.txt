# A 						New Track Emblem.
## 
### 
The athletic committee met last
night for the purpose of electing
Stanford's representatives on the
Intercollegiate Athletic Committee.
It was the consensus of opinion of
the members present that there
should be one alumnus on the In
tercollegiate committee, and in the
final vote D. E. Brown, '1)7, was
chosen as the alumni member, with
.Joe Bernard as alternate in ease of
Brown's inability to serve. The
two other members are C. A. Cant
well, '01, the present t rack manager,
and O. C. Leiter, '99, student body
treasurer.
The question of protecting the
Varsity track shirt as an emblem
was extensively discussed on ac
count of the fact that, although it
is the only badge of a man who has
competed in an intercollegiate field
day, yet there are a number of stu
dents in the University who habit
ually make use of it without hav
ing earned it. It was decided im
possible to protect the mere color
of a cardinal shirt from imitation
by non-track members, and an em
blem was proposed and accepted
by the committee. It consists of a
small German '\S," similar to tin
one on the second eleven sweater,
to be worn only on the track shirt
and only by men who liave com
peted in a field day against Berke
ley.
