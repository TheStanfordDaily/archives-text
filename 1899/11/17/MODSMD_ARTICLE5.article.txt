### 
Dr. John (J. Branner,head of the
, Geology department, has returned
I from Brazil via New York, and ar
rived at the University this morn
ing. Dr. Branner left here about
the middle of hist May as head of
a scientific expe*liti.ni which wont
to the Brazilian enast tor geological
study under ilie supervision of
Professor Agassi/ of Harvard. The
expedition studied the coral and
stone reefs of the coast of Brazil,
and then went inland, studying the
geological structure of the country
traveling in all some three thousand
miles, thirteen hundred of which
were on the coast and nineteen
hundred in the interior. Dr. Bran
ner collected a number of specimens
of corals and rocks.
Dr. Branner lived in Brazil for
eight years, some (ifteen years ago,
during which time he studied the
greater part of the country, so the
Held was not a new one for him.
His previous knowledge of the
country stood him in good stead,
his knowledge of the language par
licularly, as it is almost impossible
to get along without being able
to speak it.
Among the social changes which
have occurred in the past fifteen
years, one of the most noticeable is
the greater freedom allowed to
women. In previous years they
were not allowed to appear in pub
lic unattended, while now it is more
common to see them alone. The
cities of.Brazil have many modern
improvements, such as electric
lights, telegraph, and street cars,
the last of which aie very popular.
The principal industries of the
country are rubber gathering, sugar
and tobacco and coffee raising, and
grazing. There are a few goldmines
in the country, and formerly dia
mond mines. These latter, how
ever, are worked comparatively
little, as the competition of South
Africa is too great for them to pay
dividends. The black diamond,
used as a diamond drill, is mined
to some extent.
The public school system of
Brazil is very poor, and there are
no schools of collegiate rank in the
country.
Dr. Branner says that Brazil is
not a good place for young men un
less they have contracts for work.
There are few Americans there but
a large number of Englishmen.

in Sao Paulo, the finest of the in
land cities, among whom are: G.
\\ illianis, Geology, '1)2, who is en
caged in a. geological survey; Chas.
Dulley, '!)7, who is an electrician in
Sao Paulo; and Fred Dulley, '98,
who is teaching languages in the
