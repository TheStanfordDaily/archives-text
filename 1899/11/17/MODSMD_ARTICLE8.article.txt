That something ought to be done
about the general condition of the
University walks is apparent. At
present after a shower it is impos
sible, for instance, to get to the
postotlice without going through
mud. From Eneina to the Quad
the conditions are equally bad, and
the board walks that go from the
Quad to the Engineering buildings
are not only in bad repair, but
have now become so "loaded " that
the fountains of mud and water
that spring up geyser-like at one's
tread have become a very consid
erable nuisance. The truth of
the matter seems to be that in
pleasant weather the need of rainy
day walks is not particularly ap
parent, and when the rains come
the improvements are late and can
afford to wait over until the next
time.
