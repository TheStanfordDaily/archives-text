Several new nets have been put
in place by the tennis manager,
and the courts pepared for fall
practice. The number of men who
have taken advantage of these im
provements shows that tennis has
by no means lost its hold on Uni
versity athletes, and gives promise
of a lively struggle next spring for
places on the intercollegiate team.
No better evidence of a future vic
tory can be' shown in any branch
of contest than a spontaneous in
terest taken by prospective partici
pants. Especially is this true of
tennis, in which so much depends
upon individual play. The tennis
player, more perhaps than any
of our athletes, is the product of
long and constant practice; and
full courts this fall, with the mate
rial at hand, is the surest way of
giving us an intercollegiate team
which will maintain the victorious
record of last year.
