# VARSITY DEFEATED.
## In Another Slushy Game the Olympics Gain a Third Victory From the Varsity. 
### 
The fifth match of the Stanford-
Olympic series was won by the club
men. The game was slow and
uninteresting on account of the
muddy condition of the field, the
backs being unable to start. In the
first part of the game Stanford had
the advantage, and worked the ball
down to Olympic's twenty-yard
line, where a place kick for goal was
tried, bat Cooper fumbled and Mc-
Nevin fell on the ball.
Olympic worked the ball down
the field in short line plunges, and
McNevin carried it over the line in
a buck on tackle. Dinsmore failed
to kick goal.
Stanford kicked off, and Erskine
ran the ball in ten yards. Time
was called with the ball in the cen
ter of the field.
In the second half Raitt took
Cooper's place at quarter, Lee went
in at center, and Huston took Bent
ley's place at left tackle. The work
of the Varsity was improved a little
over that of the first half, but they
could not prevent the club men from
making another touch-down just
about two minutes before the call
of time.
For Stanford, llice, Parker, l)e
Forest, and Fisher did the best
work. Dinsmore, McNevin, and
Fickert did the best work for the
club men. With a good punter, both
of the touch-downs could have been
prevented.

The University of Oregon eleven
was defeated Saturday by the Berke
ley team by a score of 12 to 0. The
game was one of the best that IJ.C
has had to play this season. The
Oregon men put up a good fight,
and proved that the Berkeley
tackles can be smashed through for
gains, as Oregon's principal ad
vances were made through Bringle.
Wotnble scored a touch-down in
the first half, from which Kaarsberg
kicked goal. Score, 6-0.
Hopper and Moore were substi
tuted for Ellis and Smith in the
second h;tlf California scored once
in this half, Kaarsberg ;tg;iin kick
ing the goal. When time was
called U C. had the ball and were
forcing their way toward Oregon's
goal. Score, 12-0.
