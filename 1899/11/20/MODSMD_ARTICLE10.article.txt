Since Friday we have had more
encouragement for a Thanksgiving
victory than at any time this sea
son. In the first place Yale held
Harvard down to a tie with no score
on either side in the face of pros
pects for a hitter defeat and the al
most universal conviction that such
would he the result of the contest.
Next, Berkeley was only able to
beat the C regon team, which lias had
far less experience and is of an
average weight of fifteen pounds to

the man below that of their own
players, by the score of 12 to 0.
Reports from the East tell us that
Yale's game was a marvel of bril
liancy and scientific football; those
who saw the Berkeley-Oregon con
test say that the Oregonians dis
played wonderful ability and cour
age against a greatly superior
team. It is perfectly evident where
in our satisfaction lies. When men
have good, average material with
which to build; when they use that
material with sincerity and con
sistency under the guidance of as
able a teacher as ever donned a
football suit; when they have an
ample treasury behind them and
that treasury is opened freely; and
lastly, when they turn their backs
absolutely on defeat, tear it out of
their vocabulary, eradicate it from
their emotions â€”then, we say, then
are men successful. In Berkeley's
veteran team we have a mighty
obstacle. Let us form a gigantic
Stanford team, eleven hundred
stiong, fortified by eleven heroes,
the fullness of spirit, the loudest of
veiling, and go to meet that obstacle
with all our might, sending mass
plays against its center, undermin
ing its b uards, smashing down its
tackles,encircling its ends, stopping
its fullback and halves, and non
plussing its quarter. Such a team
will give a game that cannot go
against us. For it, every one of us
must be a player, our loyalty our
coach.
