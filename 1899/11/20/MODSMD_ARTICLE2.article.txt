".lack" Sheehan, '95, has Intely
returned from a six weeks' trij> t<i

New York. While in the East he
found time to visit all of the impor
tant universities. He says their at
mosphere is one of tradition and
crystalized system. The men feel
deeper in regard to all matters re
lating to college life on that ac
count, and their college spirit is
intense. When interviewed by a
representative of the Daily Palo
Alto, Mr. Sheehan gave the follow
ing interesting account of his ob
servations :
As regards football, Harvard,
Yale, and Pennsylvania have a
larger number of candidates
Princeton has not so many, but
keeps its eyes on preparatory
schools, and thereby secures good
material. As to men, the rushing
forceof Stanford teams of late years,
the physical material, is equal to
that of the East. "We have had
halfbacks," said Mr. Sheehan,
"that were better than any I saw
in the East, but in the finesse, the
generalship, the detail and finish
of the game, they are away ahead
of us."
Instead of one coach the Eastern
teams have eleven, and of course
the men receive more individual at
tention, and the play is made ex
tremely fast. One of the chief ad
vantages possessed by Eastern
colleges is that their football ma
terial has received fine preliminary
training. The men know their po
sitions before they go out on the
field. Another thing is the large
number of teams to play. A prin
cipal defect in the West is the tri
angular league. With Stanford and
U. 0. playing only the Olympics,
their game tends to become similar.
The teams reach a certain point of
development and then rest. But
in the East the smaller teams of
Lafayette,Cornell,and Carlisle, and
many others, keep interest alive,
and test the originality and re
sourcefulness of the teams that play
against them. The football men of
the East are keener in the head and
keener in the eye. Men even in a
blind rush are on the lookout. They
have to be on the alert every mo
ment in order to hold their posi
tions.
Mr. Sheehan thinks the advent
of Nevada and Oregon teams is a
step forward for football on the Pa
cific Coast, and that the sooner
Stanford and Berkeley have more
teams to play the sooner will the
Western football standard be raised.
At the same time one needs not be
discouraged. He says that some
of our best teams of either Berkeley
or Stanford could have gone against
Ifiastern teams, and not have been
ashamed of the result.
The universities of the East have
a great advantage in having so
much competition for positions on
their teams. A man who lags or
fails to do his uttermost every min
ute is liable to be retired to the side
lines. This makes fierce plav and
develops the most that is in a player.
