# "PHILIP DRUNK TO PHILIP SOBER."
## An Earnest Talk Delivered in the Chapel Sunday by Professor W.H. Hudson. 
### 
Professor Hudson gave the regu
lar sermon in the chapel yesterday
morning, choosing as his subject,
" From Philip Drunk to Philip
Sober." His talk was full of inter
est and truth, and, in part, was as
fol lows:
"There is a well-known proverb
that tells us that example is better
than precept; and every practical
teacher—everyone, in fact, who
considers conduct at all carefully—
will agree with me that this saying
is a great deal sounder than most
of our popular laws, which, at best,
are apt to give us extremely one
sided interpretations of life—and
its problems. This maxim has, in
indeed, grown up out of the moral
experiences of the race. For every
where, and at all times, men have
been quick to realize at once the
futility of mere formulas and di
rections, and the powerful stimu
lus which comes from contempla
tion of those great, strong, noble
natures which mark the finest de
velopment of our common human
ity. And as the world has grown
older, more constant stress has been
laid upon the meaning and value
of personal example.
"On its purely moral side, the
power of Christianity has largely
depended upon the fact that it has
placed in the forefront of its teach
ings, not a precept but an example;
not a dogma, but a living person.
In fact, I fancy it will be found
that the ethical force of Christi
anity in the practical affairs of the
world has always been in direct,
proportion to its emphasis upon the
life and personality of the Naza
rene teacher. Viewing the matter
in this light, we shall, I think, con
clude that there is no more signifi
cant or hopeful sign in the life of
the churches of our time than the
tendency to go back as far as pos
sible to the personal Jesus, and to
make Him a concrete, realizable
figure—an actual man among ac
tual men. Hut while I thoroughly
appreciate what we call the power
of example, I am none the less
alive to a danger that has arisen
from our tendency to dwell too
monotonously on this single ethical
note.
"The culture of character through
example means, of course, that the
type or model of excellence is al
ways presented as standing outside
ourselves. We are to seek our in
spiration and strength by looking
up to others. And liere doctrinal
Christianity has been seriously at
fault. It has made too much of the
utter worthlessness of man, it has
insisted too strenuously on this im
potency of himself to rise above
weakness and sin. Hut if, all evan
gelical dogma notwithstanding, we
| do at the bottom of our hearts be
lieve that we have capabilities of
good as well as of evil, then it is
evident, I think, that by taking
ourselves seriously in hand we may
wit bin our characters and experi
ences find a life-giving word,a high
impulse to effort and performance.
" The story runs that when the
wronged Macedonian woman had

gone from judge to judge, and had
failed to get redress, she forced her
way at lenth into the presence of
Philip himself. Now the king was
in his cups, and hastily rejected her
suit. 'I appeal,' cried the woman,
still undismayed. 'Rut to whom do
you appeal from Philip himself?'
demanded the astonished monarch.
'I appeal,' was the reply, 'from
Philip drunk to Philip sober.' Is
there not such a possibility of ap
peal in every individual life? And
if we could only make a constant
practice of such appeal; if we could
only see to' it, always and every
where, that passion, weakness, in
difference, the sensuous impulse,
should never have the last word
with us, and that every thought,
every desire, every effort, should be
carried direct to the tribunal of our
best and sanest moods, do you not
think that we should be doing some
thing towards turning to the best
account the character-material act
ually at our disposal?
"The very essence of my present
thoughts, then, is this: that con
sciously or unconsciously we are all
building for ourselves, hour by
hour, day by day, year by year,
the moral tradition of our lives.
"My last word, then, is: do not let
us be afraid of ourselves; let us rec
ognize our worth and capacity; let
us nourish no morbid humility; let
us set out. frankly, to realize the
best that we feel to be within our
reach. Let us, in particular, make
a practice of appealing honestly
and without hesitation to our high
est moods, and let us do our utmost
at all times to make these highest
moods prevail. Finally, in the
words of the poet, 'be strong and
trust high instincts more than all
the creeds.' These words may fail
us, as they have failed men before;
but through steady obedience to the
high instincts of our lives we may
be certain to find love, and hope,
and the inward satisfaction or last
ing peace which the world can
neither give nor take away."
