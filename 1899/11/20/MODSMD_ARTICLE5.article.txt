# Football Notice.
## 
### 
From now on to obtain the best
results at football practice, Coach
Chamberlin has requested that all
spectators keep away from the prac
tice and not appear on or near the
field until half-past four. The ne
cessity for secret practice, which
means so much to Eastern teams,
is felt by Coach Chamberlin in
order to get the best results at
present, and on this account the
request is made.
