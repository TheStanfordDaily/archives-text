The notice on another page of
Coach Chaniberlin's request regard
ing spectators at football practice
should be read and obeyed as im
plicitly and unquestionably as any
of the various unwritten laws that
obtain here, such as that concern
ing smoking on the quad. Every
thing possible should be done to aid
in bringing a victory on Thanks
giving day, and any ruling that
will help toward that end will be
strictly adhered to by all who have
our football interest at heart—and
that means everybody. We are re
lying on Chamberlin to evolve a
victorious team in the last few days
of practice—even as he did with the
Freshman team. And to make our
reliance apparent we should respect
his slightest wish. Also, when we
do go out on the field it would be
well for all to remember that there
is nothing more demoralizing to
good practice than a field crowded
with spectators. The utter selfish
ness of those who crowd over the
side-lines when the practice is on
the oval indicates carelessness as to
whether the team has a chance to
practice at the best advantage, or
whether the body of spectators gets
a chance to see what is going on.
And when the rooters do appear for
practice their plain duty is to
"root." Berkeley's team, which
has less need, gets much better sup
port from the side-lines than the
men in cardinal do.
