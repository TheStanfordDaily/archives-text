Whether it is because there is a
period of reaction after the decided
slump of two weeks ago; whether
it is because we take heart from the
way Old Eli stemmed the tide of
defeat last Saturday and have faith
that Old Eli's son will live up to
the teaching of his old friends in the
East, or whether it is that all of the
last practices have taken place on
the oval over which the lugubrious
"hoodoo-bird" has not flown at
the end of each practice as he is in
the habit of doing over the regular
gridiron, it is impossible to say;
but the fact remains that there is a
new life, a new enthusiasm, a new
hope in the student body concern
ing the football outlook —and it is
a good sign and points as much as
anything else can to a joyous
Thanksgiving day. We cannot
deny that a week ago there seemed
no use in not feeling blue over the
probable result. But now, every
one can feel the results of our
awakening all about him.
