The problem of Encina Hall has
probably given as much concern to
Mrs. Stanford and the University
authorities. as the reason why we
never win a field-day has to the
student body.
We heard in our freshman days
of the times of the'9s and '96 men,
when the Hall was in every sense
the center of University life; when
the men who lived outside the Hall
did not know Stanford. Then for

a time interest in Encina flagged,
the men in the Hall became fewer
and fewer, the man backed by
Encina was no longer sure of the
success of his entry into student
body politics.
But, the tide has turned again;
there are more men in the Ilall than
there were for a time, and they
come to Encina to stay. Instead
of the men in the Ilall gradually
leaving after the first month, they
have stayed. And Encina is resum
ing its old-time place in the hearts
of Stanford men.
