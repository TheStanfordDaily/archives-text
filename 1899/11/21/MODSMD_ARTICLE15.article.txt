### 
Sir Walter Besant begins in the
December Century a .series of papers
illustrating 1 ife in East London, as
it is today. His manner of treat
ing the subject is that of the
novelist, rather than the essayist, j
for he lakes as his point of departure [
the birth of a typical girl of the
East End —"One of Two Millions
in East London," —and traces her
career to the time of her marriage
at seventeen to a young count ry
man who has come up to town to
make his living as a porter.
