The Associated Engineers of
Stiinford University, which was
organized about three years ago
for the publication of the I'Jncjinecr
ituj Journal, has been reorganized
and hids fair to become a thriving
organization. The association was
formerly composed of members of

i the three engineering clubs â€” the
I Civil Engineers'Club, the Electrical
I past year and a half the three clubs
| Engineering Club and the Mechani
cal Engineers' Club; but during the
have deen practically defunct.
Owing to the increased number of
students in these departments this
year and the need of such an
organization to further their inter
ests, the old association was revived
and enlarged so as to include the
mining and chemical engineers.
The association now includes all
students in the departments of
civil, electrical, and mechanical
engineering,geology,and chemistry,
and numbers about two hundred
members. The membership is
divided into active and associate
members. The active members
are all senior and junior students
in the departments named and
number about fifty; the others
are all associate members.
The object of the association is
"the investigation of engineering
problems in all fields." It is the
intention to have meetings every
two weeks for the presentation of
papers and discussion of subjects
of general interest. Efforts will be
made to have lectures from eminent
men upon engineering topics as
often as possible. Mr. J. B. Lip
pincott, U. S. Hydrographer of
Southern California, has consented
to deliver a lecture during the
winter. The committee has several
other prominent men in view.
The association is also consider
ing the advisability of publishing
the Engineering Journal. It will
probably not appear this semester
owing to the limited time left, but
will very likely be published next
spring as formerly.
