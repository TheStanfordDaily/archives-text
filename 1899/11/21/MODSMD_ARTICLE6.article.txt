"The Hook of Knight and Bar
bara," being :i series of stories told
to children, written by President.
Jordan, and from the press of Ap
pleton iV Co., has just been received
from the publishers. The frontis-!
piece is by Bristow Adams, who]
also made the very attractive and
striking cover design, while many

of tlio illustrations are the work of
Mrs. Chloe Leslie Starks, '97. The
preface, written in Dr. Jordan's
characteristic, straightforward style,
gives a very good idea of the work!
"The only apology the author
can make in this case is that he
never meant, to do it. He had told
his own children many stories of
many kinds, some original, some
imitative, some travesties of the
work of real story-tellers. Two stu
dents of the department of Educa
tion in the Stanford University—
Mrs, Louise Maitland of Sari Jose,
and Miss Harriet Hawley of Bos
ton asked him to repeat these
stories before other children. Miss
Hawley, as a stenographer, took
them down for future reference,
and while the author was absent on
the Bering Sea Commission of 1896
she wrote them out in full, thus
forming the main text of this book.
Copies of the stories were placed by
Mrs. Maitland in the hands of hun
dreds of children, most but not all
of them in California. These drew
illustrative pictures, after their
fashion ; and from the multitude
secured, Mrs. Maitland chose those
which are here reproduced. The
scenes in the stories were also sub
jected to the criticisms of children,
and in many cases amended to meet
their suggestions. Several of the
stories, especially the classical trav
esties, would not be printed were it
not for the children's drawings.
These pictures made by the chil
dren have been found to interest
deeply other children, a fact which
gives them a certain value as origi
nal documents in the study of the
working of the child-mind. At the
end of the volume are added a few
true stories, mostly of birds and
of beasts, told to a different audi
ence. With these are a few draw
ings by University students, which
are intended to assist the imagina
tion of child-readers. " The Story
of Bob," and the stories of " Senor
Alcatraz." the "Little Blue Fox,"
and " How the Red Fox went Hunt
ing" are reprinted, by the courtesy
of Dr. \\ illiam Jay Youmans, from
Apple tons' Popular Science Monthly,
and " How the Commander Sailed,"
from the Pacific Monthly, by the
courtesy of Mr. W. Bittle Wells.
The indebtedness of the author to
Mrs. Maitland and to Miss Hawley
is indicated above.
