The football men are getting
ready for the final struggle, and it
seems expedient that the rooters,
who really have much to do with
the winning of a game, should be
gin to think of regular practice that
will make their part of the Thanks
giving pageant pass off with
thorough success. At present the
yells are far from that perfection
which a college yell should have.
In the old day we could " put it on
Berkeley a mile"in the matter of
slogans, but this year we will have
to do wonderfully well to hold our
old prestige. The Blue and Gold
song-book has some excellent yells
that can be given with a vim. It
does not seem a bad plan to prac
tice yelling and singing regularly
during the week that our team is at
Del Monte, so that the last day of
November will find everything in
trim for the best contest of which we
are capable.
Now that the Department of
Hygiene has established a basket
ball court at Encina gymnasium,
there should be an awakening of
interest in this branch of athletics.
Heretofore, on this Coast, basket
ball has been looked on as a game
for women only, being of too mild
a nature to attract men. Those who
understand the game realize its
value as a healthy and vigorous
form of exercise, without the danger
of football and yet more exciting
than baseball. The universities of
the East have recognized its value
as a sport and have organized
teams and hold regular intercol
legiate contests.
With basket-ball as a regular
part of gymnasium work, and an
arousal of interest in it as a sport,
we should see the formation of a
basket-ball team among the men.
This should attract men who are
not interested in other sports, and
ought in time even become an inter
collegiate event.
