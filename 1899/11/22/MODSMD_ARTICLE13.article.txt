The death of Dr. J. H. Stallard
ofMenlo Park takes away a promi
nent figure, and it is well to pause
for a moment in our busy lives to
note something of his life and work.
After a successful professional ca
reer in England, which brought
him in contact with many Eng
lish social thinkers, Dr. Stallard
moved to the Coast in the early sev
enties, and built up a practice in
San Francisco. Of late years, with
a noble disinterestedness, he de
voted his strength to the study of
social questions. During the dis
cussions of San Francisco's new
charter the doctor contributed to
the Overland Monthly, and after
wards published in pamphlet form,
a series of articles on u The Prob
lem of Municipal Government in
San Francisco," which embodies
the best defense of the English
Council type of city government
that has yet appeared. In years to
come it will rank as a classic. Last
year he and Dr. Jordan exchanged
views on the land question in a
series of letters which appeared this
fall under the title, '' The True
Basis of Economics." In this work
Dr. Stallard recast the doctrines of
Henry George in a form more agree
able to modern scientitic notions of
law and right. His plea contains
more than one eloquent passage
that testifies to his large heart and
sympathy with his fellow men.
Even on his sick-bed Dr. Stallard's
thoughts were occupied with a plan
for inducing the thinking students
of Berkeley and Stanford to test the
doctrines of "equal rights to all
men " enunciated in the Declara
tion of Independence.
Dr. Stallard has on several occa
sions spoken before the students of
the Economics department. In him
they have lost a true friend and an
inspiring exainpleof self-sacrificing
public spirit.
