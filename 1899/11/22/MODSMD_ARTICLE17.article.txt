# Next "Chaparral."
## 
### 
The Chaparral will he late
on account of the extra work
being embodied in getting out
the Thanksgiving issue, but
when it does come it is prob
able that it will show up as the best
special edition gotten out by an un
dergraduate publication at Stan
ford. Its sixteen pages will be
fully illustrated, and hardly an
article will appear that does not
relate to football. There are a
greater number of personal "joshes"
than before, including one on the
most prominent member of the
band. Culver's double-page draw
ing of the ideal Stanford girl on
the side-lines, with juniors, seniors,
players, and Billy McLeod in the
distance, is the cleverest thing he
has done in a long time. Mr. Cul
ver will draw exclusively for the
Chaparral during the coming year,
with the exception of such work as
he may do for Puck, Judge, or Life.
The half-tones of "Babe" Burnett
and Murphy —the latter in two
colors —will alone be worth the
price of the publication, which, for
this issue, on account of the extra
pages and supplements, will be fif
teen cents. Subscribers, however,
get it as a regular issue.
