The teams could use but half the
field for their work last night on
account of the rain, the lower part
of the oval being under water.
The elevens lined up as follows :
Varsity. Second.
llice 1 end r Beckley
Bentley .... 1 tackle r Huston
i)eForest. . .1 guard r Cairns
Lee center John
10. Gil man . . r guard 1.. . P. Oilman
Burnett. . . . r tackle 1 Dole
Parker r end 1 Caches
Cooper quarter llaitt
Smith 1 half r Nourse
Fisher r half 1 Hough

The Second eleven succeeded in
gaining against the Varsity by
using a close formation. Several
trick plays were aiso tried, and
worked to advantage. The play of
the two teams throughout seemed
about equal, as the Varsity made
no great headway.
Smith made two long end runs
under good interference, but finally
turned his ankle and had to lay off.
10. (jiilman was tried at guard on
the Varsity for the first time. This
opens up a new light for the guard
position, as Oilman has heretofore
been playing center on the Second.
Lee was given a try at center on
the Varsity, and put up a fair
game. .Johns, his opponent <>n the
Second, also played a strong game,
though light for Lhe position.
The physical condition of the
men, barring accidents, is much bet
ter than at this time last year, and
the week at Del Monte should put
every one of the players in the best
possible shape. T. McFadden is

still out of the game, and will not
line up this week. Murphy is also
laid up, and will not be able to be
out with the pqund for a few days.
It is even possible that Murphy
may not be able to play at all.
With him out, and Kodolph barred
by the faculty, there will be no one
who can be thoroughly relied on for
good punting.
