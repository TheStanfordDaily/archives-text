# "FORMATION OF THE NEBULA."
## The 						Regular Tuesday Evening Lecture by Prof. James E. Keeler of the Lick Observatory. 
### 
In spite of the bad weather there
was a fairly large crowd at the lec
ture last evening by Prof, lveeler
of Lick Observatory, to hear of the
formation of the nebulai. It was
fully illustrated by many interest
ing lantern slides.
The lecturer contended that there
is perhaps no great addition to the
ordinary workaday life of the indi
vidual in the knowledge of astron
omy, but the lesson that astronomy
really teaches is the greatness of
the universe, and the comparative
smallness of man. He likened
mankind in the abstract to the in
dividuals in an ant-hill. Their
world is bounded by a hundred
yards' distance. And as the world
is incomprehensible to the ant, so
is even the solar system incompre
hensible to man, although the solar
system as compared to the rest of
space is a very small portion.
After a popular discourse on the
solar system, giving some interest
ing comparisons of the most well
known planets, Prof. Keeler went
into a historical resuin6 of the neb
ular hypothesis. The best hypoth
esis advanced, that of La Place, was
that space was occupied bj' a nebu
lous mass of a high-degree of tem
perature, having a rotary motion,
in the course of time the nebulous
mass would become denser at
the center, and then centrifugal
force would leave nebulous rings
which would become more solid,
and then might break and "ball"
up into planets, the central mass
becoming the sun. This hypothe
sis explains everything that was
known to its expounder. But mod
ern research has found facts which
La Place did not know, but which
cannot entirely subvert the theory.
After the lantern slides, which
were intensely interesting, giving
views of various nebulae, sun spots,
pictures of prominent astronomers,
and some of the ancient ideas of
the solar system and the earth,
Prof. Keeler in a few concluding re
marks gave a resume of the real
value of the sun in our everyday
lives, and characterized it as the
source of all the phenomena of na
ture with which we are acquainted.
