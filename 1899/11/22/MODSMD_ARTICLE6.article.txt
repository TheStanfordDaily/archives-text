### 
A meeting of the Graduate Club
was held at Madrono Hall Satur
day evening, Dr. Duniwny ad
dressing the club upon the Na
tional Federation of Graduate
Clubs. The club was singularly
fortunate in its choice of a speaker
for the first meeting. Dr. Duniway
having been i\ leading spirit in the
movement which resulted in the
National Federation of Graduate
Clubs.
The speaker first gave a brief
and interesting sketch of the pur
poses and methods of the Harvard
Graduate Club, of which he was
president. He then passed to the
history of the beginnings of the
movement for federation. The idea
of a federation was discussed in
1892 at a convention held in New
York b}' delegates from the clubs
of Harvard, Cornell, and Johns
Hopkins. No definite action was

taken at that time, but an open let
ter published by that assembly led
to a convention of graduate students
at Philadelphia the succeeding year.
Here the plan of federation was
definitely formulated and a consti
tution adopted. Dr. Duniwny was
a member of the committee which
drafted this constitution, and was
elected editor of the tirst annual
handbook issued by the federation.
This handbook gave for the first
time in available form a succinct
and trustworthy statement of all
courses offered for graduate stu
dents in the leading colleges and
universities in America. Dr. Duni
way gave many interesting and
amusing reminiscences of his edi
torial trials with refractory facul
ties that persisted in padding their
announcements, and gave many in
cidents illustrative of the influence
which the federation is beginning
to wield in American universities.
Two of the most important results
of the organization are an increased
uniformity in the requirements for
the Ph. D. degree, and the facilita
tion of intermigration among Amer
ican universities. The speaker
closed with a word of encourage
ment to the Stanford Graduate
Club, and a summary of what might
be accomplished by its members for
themselves individually and for
the University at large.
The club is greatly indebted to
Dr. Duniway for his interesting and
able address, and to the young la
dies of Madrono Hall, who so gra
ciously placed their parlors at the
disposal of the club.
