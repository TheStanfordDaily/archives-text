# THE
						COACH INTERVIEWED.
## Chamberlin Gives an Account of the Work of the Men. 
### 
Coach Chamberlin said this after
noon that the prospects of the team
were much brighter than they were
two weeks ago, and seemed to think
that the week's practice at Del
Monte would bring the team into
good shape. The men are in ex
cellent physical condition, and have
improved greatly in the last week.
The coach had the following to
say on a team picked for his crit
icism :
For end, Rice and McFadden
play a good game. McFadden is
the surest tackier on the field, and
while he is a slow runner, gets down
fast on kicks. This is paradoxical,
but true. McFadden's principal
fault is that he is apt to attempt
too much work on the center of the
line on the defense.
Rice is the fastest man on the
field, though apt to overrun his
man on kicks. He follows the ball
well and keeps his eyes open.
Burnett at left tackle plays a fair
game now, but will in all probabil
ity play a better game on Thanks
giving than lie has heretofore. He
is better at opening up holes than
running with the ball.
Treager at right tackle is the
surest man at his position in the
line. His best qualities are that he
keeps his eyes open and gets down
on kicks well.
De Forest at guard has played
his position longer than any man
on the team. He breaks through
the line and runs well with the ball.
Gilman is a new man at guard,
as he has been playing center on
the Second. He blocks center plays,
but does not cover as much ground
as he should.
Lee would make a good man at
center, but he does not play the
football there is in him. He might
do much better and should wake up.
Rbth Smith and Fisher, for halves,
are better on the offensive than de
fense, and both have a tendency to
shut their eyes while running.
Boren, at full, goes into the line
well for his weight, but is not strong
on defense.
Raitt, as quarter, catches punts
fairly, running them in in good
style, lie is a fair tackier and
plays tact.
As a general criticism of the
whole team, I should say that the
men are slow in starting and that
the line lacks aggressiveness.
Captain Murphy, when inter
viewed this afternoon, said: "The
men have made rapid improvement
in the last week, and with few ex
ceptions are in excellent condition.
They have played conscientiously
throughout the season and have
grasped Coach Chamberlin's spirit
of play. I feel confident that, with
this week's secret practice at Mont
erey, we will turn out a strong
team. The men have the fullest
confidence in Coach Chamberlin
and Mr. Murphy. They have im
proved wonderfully under the di
rection of these nwn and the assist
ant coachers, Lewers, Reynolds, and
Cotton."
1 wenty-six men go to Del Monte
for the final wtek of practice; every
one of them has a chance yet to
play against Berkeley.

The list is: Lee, Hayden, De-
Forest, Cairns, Gilman, Wrigley,
Dole, Bentley, Burnett, Treager,
Huston, Beck ley, l'arker, T. Mc-
Fadden, Rice, Raitt, Cooper, Smith,
Fisher, Boren, Ilodolph, Hough,
Erb, Allen, Roberts, and Murphy.
