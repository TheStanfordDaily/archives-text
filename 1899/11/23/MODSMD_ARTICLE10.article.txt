# College Notes.
## 
### 
—Yale has followed the example
set by the Western colleges, and
now has a student band to help in
the " jollying-up " process on the
bleachers.
—The whole country has been
aroused to the possible dangers of
college fraternity excesses by a sad
fatality at Cornell University. In
the course of some absurd tests ap
plied to a freshman student, liid
ward Berkley, of St. Louis, while
he was being initiated into the
Kappa Alpha secret fraternity.
Berkley was drowned in a canal
that he attempted to cross while
''obeying orders." Filled with re
morse, the fraternity men respon
sible for the accident accompanied
the dead body to the home of the
bereaved parents in St. Louis.
—President Eliot of Harvard re
cently said that mankind has been
striving for centuries to find out
what studies are best adapted to the
masculine mind, of which work our
university curriculums are the pro
duct. Therefore, he says, it is a
mistake for women's colleges to
copy these curriculums; they should
find out what studies are hest for
women students. A woman replies
to Harvard's president by saying
there is no sex in science and
knowledge, and that it is grossly
unreasonable for men, after having
appropriated all the arts and al
most all the literatures, to demand
that women discover or create new
arts and sciences for themselves, or
forego all share in the higher educa
tion.
—An intercollegiate debating
conference, at which representatives
of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton
were present,was hel dat New Haven
recently. Several important changes
were made in reference to this
year's debates. Among other
things, it was decided by the repre
sentatives of the three colleges that
the affirmative instead of the
negative should make the last re
buttal speech. This is the course
followed in the law courts of the
United States and undoubtedly is
much fairer than the former
method. It was also agreed to
abolish the customary banquet
after Harvard-Yale debate, as the} 7
have never proved very successful.
The debate between Harvard and
Yale will be held at New Haven
some time in March, and Yale's j
contest with Princeton will take
place at Princeton in May.
