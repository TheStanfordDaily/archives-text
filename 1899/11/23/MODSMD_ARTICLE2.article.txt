# From the "Occident."

In speaking of the Nevada-Cali
fornia contest, Berkeley's weekly
has this to say in conclusion :
'â€¢This game revealed the fact
that it is possible for a light but
gritty team to play a strong eleven,
like ours, almost to a stand-still.
Stanford is making tremendous
strides, bending every energy and
effort to save herself from what
has seemed certain defeat. She
may be depended upon to take that
brace. She may be expected to
spring her annual run of surprises.
And she is certain to put a team in
the field that will light with a ter
rible intensity. It remains for us
to lie prepared to play on Thanks
giving day, not in the sloth of over
confidence, but in a hurricane of
fierceness that will sweep Stanford
again from the field and wipe out
the bitterest memories of her '20
and 28 to 0."
