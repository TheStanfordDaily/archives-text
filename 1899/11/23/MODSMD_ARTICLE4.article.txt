# Proposed Glee Club Tour.
## 
### 
Managers Drake and Parkin, for
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs re
spectively, appeared before the Ex
ecutive Committee of the \ssociated
Students at the last meeting to dis
cuss matters relating to the trip of
the combined clubs this year. Dur
ing the Christmas holidays the
clubs will go south in this State,
visiting Los Angeles, Pasadena,
Santa Barbara, Riverside, and other
cities on their route, returning to
the University for the opening of
the next semester. There was some
discussion as to the advisability of
securing the services of a profes
sional advance agent, or of having
a student or graduate as heretofore.
The choice was finally left in the
hands of Treasurer Leiter. As in
former years, it was decided that
each member of the clubs should
deposit with the student body treas
urer a, note to insure the student
body against loss on the trip. The
money for the notes of last year,
which has not yet been paid, will
be raised by concerts on the cam
pus and in Palo Alto before the
clubs start on their tour, these con
certs to be given about the middle
of December.
