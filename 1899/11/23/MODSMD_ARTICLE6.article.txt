# FOOTBALL SONGS.
## The 						Words that Berkeley Will Sing Thanksgiving Day. 
### 
[We print a few extracts from the
''California Song-Book''—in fact we
print the songs practically in full.
\\ e have got to hear them anyway,
and we might as well get the full
benefit of them a little before the
time that Berkeley had set for
throwing them out. A perusal of
them will not lessen our desire to
win on Thanksgiving day. Outside
of the grammar in " It don't," there
are other objections to :
" Your team is like your college,
It don't possess the knowledge, etc."
It is a rule seldom broken that
no poetry be published in the Daily
Palo Alto, but in this instance, —
in the first place they are not
poetry, and in the second place,
this is a special occasion. "What
is their loss is our gain." —Ed.]
CALIFORNIA'S BOUND TO WIN.
Air —"John Brown's Body."
There's a banner bright of Blue and Gold
which proudly we display!
There's a peerless team whose prowess
fills the red-shirts with dismay!
There's a mighty chorus thund'ring from
the campus to the bay,
California's bound to win!
Cuokus :
We'll shout for dear old California!
Shout for dear ohLCalifornia!
We'll shout for dear old California!
California's bound to win!
Oh, we won in track and baseball, and
we won in each debate,
And we won the great Thanksgiving
game in eighteen ninety-eight!
And we're going to win them all again
this year as sure as fate!
California's bound to win !
Chokus.
ROOTING VERSES.
Same Air.
Oh Stanford's go and soak your head in
San Francisco Bay!
In Dr. Jordan's museum they will place
the Stanford team!
.1// —Last part ("Trio") ot " Whistlinq
Jiufus."
Around the ends and through the line we
jump; the ball is
Always in tiie Stanford country,
Nearer, —nearer, —near the goal-line!
There—we cross, —we kick the goal, we
pile the points up,—
Win the game again for California!
Chorus :
For California!
Oh, California!
For California !
Oh, California!
So when the day's done
And when the game's won
We'll up and shout, for the
Bi.uk and Gold!!
Oli, poor old Stanford,
Where are you now?
You've met our players,
Our "Uoskey ! Wow!"
We've got the team, sure,
And Cochran, too;
We'll beat the score of
Naught to twenty-two!
Oh, poor old Stanford,
\\ here are you now ?
You've met our players,
Our "Hoskey! Wow!"
Up in the heavens
The Gold and Blue:
We've won by more than
Naught to twenty-two!
ON THANKSGIVING DAY!
Aii —"On the Day When Dewey Comes
Home."
It's no Him, we're bound to win,
On next Thanksgiving Day;
We'll run an end, their line we'll bend,
When we get in the play;
That's no dream, we've got the team,
That'll play when time is called,
The score will be (forty-four?) to nothing,
Witli Stanford sauer-bawled.

Chorus :
Won't there be a hot old time,
When our boy,s come on the lield;
Every Stanford man
Will know his fate is sealed;
With a ha, ha, and a yell,
We'll help them in their play,
Tor they'll just make tracks through
Stanford,
On next Thanksgiving Day.
Just watch Hall, get that ball,
And straight-arm every man;
Jimmie Whip, will turn a Hip,
Right through the Stanford gang;
See that smash, hear that crash,
As Smith goes through that hole;
Now the ball is over
And Kaarsberg kicks the goal.
NOW IS THE TIME TO SCORE.
Tune—"Billy Magee Magaw."
The play is on—the game's begun—
Now is the time to score.
We'll buck their line —we'll make a
run—
Of thirty yards or more.
And then we'll force them down the
lield;
That Stanford line will have to yield,
And we'll shut those red-coats out,
Be/ore the game is o'er,
And we'il all stand up and shout
Now is the time to score.
We've got a team that's bound to win;
They'll make the raZ-coats sore.
The lobster backs will all cave in,
As ice roll up our score.
\\ e'll block their kicks, we'll take the
ball,
The quarter '11 pass it to Perry Hall,
And he'll dash through them all
And make one touch-down more;
And we'll all stand up and yell,
That is the way we score.
Tune—" Daisy Bell.' '
Stanford, Stanford,
Wearers of cardinal hue,
You're too easy,
For us to dally with you;
Your team is like your college,
It don't possess the knowledge,
But you'll look sweet under the feet
Of the dear old Gold and Blue.
Stanford, Stanford,
This is Thanksgiving Day,
For old California
You were an easy prey:
You are now half crazy,
Our team it is a daisy,
You do look sweet under the feet
Of the dear old Gold and Blue.
FOOTBALL SONG.
