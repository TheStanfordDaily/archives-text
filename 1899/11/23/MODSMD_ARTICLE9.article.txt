The last practice of the year on
the campus has been played. To
morrow the men will leave for se
cret practice and we will not see
them again until the time of the
final match on Thanksgiving day.
With more or less of the proper
college spirit we have cheered our
men through the long season of
preliminary practice.
We shall have reports of the pro
gress of the team from time to
time, but will be unable to see the
men in practice. We will live in
an atmosphere of hope and expec
tation, in a hushed existence as
compared to the last few days of
feverish anxiety as to the welfare of
the men and the make-up of the
team. From now on football talk
will be less rife —and thoughts will
be deeper. Every item that con
cerns the team will be read with
avidity and pondered over. We
are going to be thinking, as we al
ways do, "To win or not to win:
that is the question." But we are
going to be thinking it more deeply
and earnestly than ever before.
We can rely thoroughly on our
coach and on our men—and we can
do our best to show that reliance
and our full faith. On this last
week depends our victory or our
defeat. We cannot gainsay that.
But an attitude of determination

for victory held by every student
will go a long way toward attaining
the goal of our ambition for Thanks
giving day.
