# THE 						FOOTBALL RALLY
## The 						Chapel Filled Last Night, and the Team Given a Most Enthusiastic Farewell. 
### 
The football rally last night was
beyond doubt the most successful
one ever given at Stanford. The
greatest enthusiasm was displayed
by faculty, coaches, team, and
rooters. Every one was stirred up
to the highest pitch of enthusiasm,
and the team left for Del Monte
this morning with the assurance
that the whole University to a man
is behind them.
Long before the hour set for the
chapel doors to open, the quad
rangle was thronged hy an eager
crowd. Within a few minutes
after the doors were opened the
chapel was packed to the doors
and standing room was at a prem
ium. Outside, the arcade was
filled by a large number who
wished to listen to the speeches.
A large number of seats were
roped off for the rooters and the
band. A section was also reserved
for the team and coaches.
Before the team arrived a collec
tion was taken to purchase
floral decorations for the private
car for the team. This was as a
surprise for them. Over $18 was
subscribed.
The yelling under the leadership
of Irwin, '99, and Springer, '00,
was well conducted. The rooters
yelled and sang with more enthusi
asm than has been shown yet this
season.
The Band and the Glee Club also
participated. The Glee Club led
tiie singing and also gave a new
football song that was very well
recci ved.
When the team arrived they were
greeted by the Stanford yell and
''All Hail the Team!"
Dr. Stillman presided and made
the opening speech, lie spoke of
the hard fight before the team, but
was fearful for the outcome.
Dr. Jordan, who followed, spoke
in his usual characteristic way.
"His purpose," he said, "was not
to help jolly up, but to help pre
serve the dignity of the occasion."
His speech was filled with sound
advice as to the action of the team
and rooters on Thanksgiving Day.
The assistant coaches, Professors
Reynolds and Lewers, were then
called for. They each discussed
the future, and spoke encouragingly
of the prospects. The improvement
of the last week septus to them to
give every hope for the future.
Dr. Fetter made the speech of the
evening. It. bubbled over with wit
and humor, but filled with good
advice to the team and rooters. In
his opinion there is cause for the
highest hope. The appearance of
tilings has changed. The rain of
last week has brought the rainbow
of promise.
Dr. Ross and Prof. Richardson
also spoke for the faculty.
Coach Chamberlin, Trainer Mur
phy, " Billy " MacLeod, and Man
ager Berry were called for. The
trainers and coach promised to put
a team in the Held next Thursday
that will lie a surprise, not only to
Berkeley, hut to the Stanford root
ers.
" Bill " Irwin, '99, "Archie" Rice,
'95. and "Jack" Sheehan, '95,

spoke for the alumni. They were |
confident that the team will he a :
credit to Stanford, and the best
team that can he put out.
Captain Murphy and each mem
ber of the team and squad werej
called for, and responded. They
are all confident of the result.
After a song by the Glee Club, and
three cheers for the team and
coaches, the most successful rally
ever given in years came to an end.
After the rally the men all gath
ered in Encina clubroom, where,
under the leadership of "Bill"
Irwin, '99, every wight in Encina
dormitory was procured and donned.
The men formed in single column
lock-step, and with "Teddy" Bur
wick, '02, and "Abe" Newherg, '02,
at the lead, marched to the Zeta Psi
house. Captain Murphy and Coach
Chamberlin were called out and
spoke briefly. The procession again
reformed and marched over to Ro
ble and Dr. Jordan's. After sere
nading Roble the procession re
turned to the quad, where it dis
banded. Over three hundred men
were in the procession. The parade
was the best and most unique mid
night procession ever attempted at
Stanford, and the credit for its con
ception and successful fulfilment is
due to Bill Irwin, who was in com
mand.
The announcement at the rally
that the football men would be
given a final "send-off" this morn
ing was hardly necessary. That,
everybody accepted as a matter of
course. It seemed to be taken for
granted that there would he no at
tendance at second and third hour
recitations, and many of the pro
fessors even posted notices early in
the morning that their last hour
classes would not meet.
At the close of the first recitation
students laid aside their books and
a Stanford yell near the main en
trance brought them all together.
A single line was formed with the
bass drum in the lead, and in lock
step over three hundred men
marched in "S" formation around
the quadrangle.
It was about half past nine when
the rumble of coach wheels was
heard on the pavement, and' the
crowd flocked toward the east end.
Two four-horse buses, filled with
the football men and their trainers,
swung in through the entrance.
Crowds formed in their way and
caught the bridles to bring them to
a stop. Horses were quickly un
hitched, and with cheers the stu
dents took their places. Not con
tent with this, ihev brought a
dump-cart into requisition and
into this raised Captain Murphy
and Coach Chamberlin. From both
of these short speeches were de
manded, and they were only al
lowed to get into the coaches as
t rain time approached.
Still dragged by lusty students,
the coaches went out the entrance
and down the avenue to I'alo Alto.
At the depot another demonstra
tion was held.
Through the generosity of the
railway company three men had
gone to the city to decorate the
special car. Festoons of cardinal
bunting were hung outside, and

the interior was filled with smilax,
chrysanthemums, and red carna
tions.
Room was hardly left for the
football men, so great was the
throng that pressed into the car.
As the train pulled out it carried
same two hundred dead-heads who
took up the time to Mayfield with
farewells and admonitions to the
men. There they gathered on the
platform and three final goud-bye
cheers were given for the team, the
captain, and the coaches.
