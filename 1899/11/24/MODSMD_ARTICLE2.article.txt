# Final Campus Practice.
## 
### 
The last practice the team will
have on the campus showed yester
day afternoon that the men are
ready for the game next Thursday.
The play was snappy and sharp,
both elevens getting down to work
in grod style. Coaches Lewers
and Fickert lined up with the
second and helped stiffen their
line.
The crowd was the largest out
for practice this year and the
rooters jollied the team and coaches
as it was the last chance they
would have at them before the
game. Several of the old students
were out on the oval and in the
yell leading.
