We iiavr given our team an en
thusiastic send-off and now feel
content to await the results of this
week's work of development in the
secret practice at Del Monte. We
know that nothing will he left un
done, and we know that the men
will go into the practices at train
ing quarters with determination
and spirit. With a united college
behind it, the team will do as Stan
ford teams have done before—reach
the point of perfection at the proper
time. Besides the encouragement
which this send-off gives to the
men who have worked so hard for
a University victory on the grid
iron when there have been so many
discouragements, it will also serve
the purpose of proving to those who
have been bemoaning the death of
Stanford spirit that the same spirit
is as intense as it ever was.
