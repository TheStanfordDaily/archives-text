By no means the least pleasing
feature of our annual rallies is the
number of former students which
they bring back for a visit. Ex
ample is the best formula for suc
cess, and no greater inspiration can
be given than a hand-shake or even
the sight of some hero of former
victories. Whether it be a football
or baseball send-off, or a debating
preliminary, there are almost sure
to appear in the audience some of
the men who have won fame for
Stanford in these spheres in past
times. \Ve are glad to see them,
not less for the influence their pres
ence has than for themselves. It is
the wish of Stanford undergrad
uates that their number may in
crease from year to year and that
age may only serve to strengthen
the interest they take in our in
tercollegiate success.
