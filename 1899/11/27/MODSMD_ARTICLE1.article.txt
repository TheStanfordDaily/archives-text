# THANKSGIVING SERVICE.
## Professor Murray Delivers the Annual Address in the Chapel. Special Music. 
### 
The Thanksgiving service was
held in the chapel Sunday morn
ing. A quartette under the direc
tion of Dr. Little sang several an
thems; solos were rendered by
Mrs. M. ]R. Smith and Dr. Little;
and a number of young men as
sisted with orchestral instruments.
Dr. Murray delivered the address
and said in part:
"As year by year the season of
Thanksgiving conies there come
with it varying feelings. All
throughout our land men and
women are thanking God for the
gifts of the year; yet not all who
bow the head have the same heart
in their thanksgiving, and thous
ands bow not nor utter thanks.
"To many it is but an old Puri
tanic custom that is now meaning
less. There was a time, they say,
when men regarded the harvesting
of the fruits of the year as a proper
season for gratitude to the Al
mighty, from whose hand these
and all good things come: they
were special mercies and called
for special thanks. And so men
sowed in faith, and reaped with
thanksgiving. But this was in
the days of old. We of today,
they say, see in the succession of
the seasons, in the germinating of
the corn and its maturing, but the
inevitable consequences of definite
causes; and whether abundant
rains cause the fields to yield abun
dant increase, or whether the
ground be parched and the grain
wither ere it get its growth, we see
niether special Providence nor
special mercy, but only the inevi
table, the remorseless, the working
of law.
"And others too look back upon
a year of sorrow, and this anniver
sary season finds their hearts heavy
while other hearts are glad; and,
as they scan the experience of the
year, they cannot find it in their
hearts to utter thanks—nay, rather
they cry, may be: 'would that this
year had not been!'
"Yet we are met for thanksgiv
ing; and am.id these varied feel
ings there is a common ground for
us all. We see but dimly along
the pathway of life: the wisest of
humankind, in the face of life's
mystery, are but fools and blind.
What comes into our own lives of
joy or sorrow attains a magnitude,
an importance beyond its worth;
and what comes to another seems,
too often, a little tiling. It is hard
for us to see the facts of life in a
true perspective. Yet it is given,
I think, to all men, at times to
ascend the mount of vision, whence
the eyes see somewhat more clearly;
where the mists of our self-cen
tered ness fade away and we come
nearer to obtaining a view of truth.
"Let us seek to climb a little
higher ere we give thanks this
morning; let us leave the low-land
of our individual, selfish lives, our
short-sighted hopes and ambitions,
and with a new and clearer vision
look back over the year.
"Has it been one of failure? and
have you learned in the hard
school of experience the inevitable

lesson that must come? If so, well.
'Gird up now thy loins like a man,'
and face the new year with stronger
heart and firmer resolve. Yes, and
thank God that the lesson has
been learned, and that you can he
heartened for your duty and your
toil. And in your failure have you
learned what it is to have a friend?
Has the clasp of the hand, the
hearty word of comradeship, come
to you when you needed it? and
has your heart been warmed there
by? Has not this made life richer,
even in failure, —this sense of love
and sympathy?
"Or it may have been a year of
success, and it may have brought
the fruition of long-cherished de
sires. If so, render thanks to God
that in His inscrutable Providence
this has been your portion. Hut
look deep into your own heart,
lias your gain been another's loss?
Have you ever won what should
rightly have been another's? Then
better a thousand times failure and
uncertainty, baffled hopes, and
anguish of heart. For success so
won brings with it the seeds of
those things that blight life and
make it a bitterness. But if the
year has brought successes upon
which you can look back with
honest satisfaction, then, see that
the good things God has given y< u
do but enlarge your capacity for
service. See that, through you,
blessing may came to others; that
through you the loving-kindness of
our God may be manifested; and
find, for yourself, a ten-fold bles
sing in ser vice, —service to God and
service to man."
Dr. Murray then showed that
those who have had only sorrow,
grief, and bereavement, during the
past year, yet have cause for
thanksgiving, "for,"he said, "who
shall measure the degree in which
sorrow enriches life? No man ever
sounded the depths of human love
and human sympathy who has
not suffered." Then, continuing
the speech, he said:
"And it may have been bereave
ment. Here the voice falters, for
we think of him who might have
spoken to us today, had God so
willed: and in our own great loss
can we speak of thankfulness? Hut
is it in vain then that Wilbur
Thoburn lived among us, and
talked to us of the Father? Is it
nothing to have known him and
called him friend? nothing, that
the sweet influences of bis life are
with us now, inspiring us, streng
thening us, hallowing us? Let us
thank God that we knew him and
loved him; that in our loss we have
come to know how deep that love
was: thank Him for the memories
that crowd upon us to cheer and
hearten us. We have learned to
call death God's servant, have
learned that lie indeed wears the
face of an angel, and that in the
grief, and sorrow, and loneliness,
rich blessings may follow, nay,
will follow if we but open our hearts
to receive them.".
Dr. Murray then spoke of those
who have become unsettled in their
belief and who are doubtful as to
their old religion. These also have
cause for thanksgiving, he said, for
"theological systems save not, but
service doth save."

"Let us thank Him for this. Let
us make this our prayer: that this
grace may be given us in larger
measure as each year passes —grace
to see God in all things. Without
Him joy is barren, and with Him
the sorest trial is fraught with bless
ing. May it be ours to walk with
Him day by day, to follow in the
path of His leading, to win the rich
blessedness of revealing Him to
others.
"For there are those who know
Him not nor care to know: men
and women who live as though
Christ had never come, as though
the law of love, and service, and
blessing, had never been given to
man. These may be reached by
love, for love overeometh all things.
Ah! let us thank God for love, and
for the hope that is ours because He
is love. And may our Thankgiv
ing be blended with a prayer that
it may be granted us to live lives
of loving service. So shall we be
His disciples who taught men what
it was to be one with the Faith."
