# PROGRESSING AT DEL MONTE.
## Stanford's Varsity Being Put in Fine Shape by the Climate of the Sea Coast.

Coach Reynolds came back from
i Monterey last night, where he had
been with the team. Me says that
the men are all in splendid condi
tion and spirits, every one of them
ready to go up against Berkeley
and play the game of his life. The
hotel management has done a great
deal to make the men comfortable,
and they are more than satisfied
with the treatment given them.
1 lie fellows gather aronnd the
piano in the ball-room every night,
singing and dancing till time for
bed.
The practice game Saturday
night was like an intercollegiate
match for fierceness and spirit.
Ihe two elevens lined up and
played ball from start to finish.
1 he reports of California's improve
ment in form and condition haven't
the least depressing effect on the
twenty-six, but seem to stir them
up to work all the harder.
The team will not be announced
till Thursday morning, and any
line-up given out before that time
time will not be authentic, though
eight of the positions are already
practically filled. The other three
are still in doubt, and the selection
will depend largely on Captain
Murphy. If he plays,quarter and
full will be different from what they
will if he does not.
Yesterday a number of the men
went around the seventeen-mile
drive, as there was no practice.
The teams will line up this after
noon for their final game, resting
tomorrow and Wednesday.
Charles M. Fickert, '98, ex-Var
sity football captain and treasurer
of the student body, one of the
graduate coaches this year, re
turned today from Del Monte. He
reports enthusiastically that the
team is in excellent health and
spirits, and says he considers Del
Monte an ideal place. As to the
men he does not say much and can
throw no light on the probable line
up regarding the most closely con
tested positions. The halves are a
surety for Fisher and Smith, and
McFadden goes on at end. De-
Forest and Treager are also billed
to appear Thanksgiving day; but
aside from these the fight goes mer
rily on. That for the right end
position has taken on a new phase
in the candidacy of Beckley, who is
being now looked upon as a prob
ability.
