What is the matter with those
who have already begun to deface
the top of the Memorial Arch by
carving their names in the stone ?
Do they claim to be Stanford men ?
Do they consider that structure a
monument to themselves? Do they
intend by their actions to make it
necessary for the arch to be closed
to the students ? If so the sooner
they are out of the University the
better. Stanford does not want
such people.
