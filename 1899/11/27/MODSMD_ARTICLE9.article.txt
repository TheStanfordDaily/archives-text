It is amusing to read in the daily
papers the stories that the Berkeley
student body is in as much of a
slump as the Berkeley football team
was supposed to have been in early
last week. The men across the
bay are apparently endeavoring to
decrease our chances by making us
to some extent over-confident of
success, but in this they have struck
just as hard a proposition as they
will strike when they meet us next
Thursday. Stanford never yet was
over-confident in a football game
with Berkeley, and least of all shall
we be this year. No one with the
least fcrainof sense would entertain
for a moment such an idea. No,
we have as momentous a task be
fore us as football men ever had,
but we no more shrink from it than
did our brave men from the pierc
ing Mauser bullets of the treacher
ous Spaniards or from the terrible
shells of the artillery of the skulking
Filipinos. We are to send our best
beloved to battle, and when they
meet the foe they will be as fearless
as Dewey before the deathly torpe
does in the harbor of Manila. In
spite of the odds against us, our
eleven brawny heroes will fight as
only men can fight, for themselves,
their coach, their University, that
word " Stanford" we love as we
love almost nothing else. The
vitality and spirit of every man

on the eleven will be multi
plied an hundred fold, and if our
team suffers defeat, it will do so
with all the glory due those who
have done their very best. We
will stand to a man by the outcome
of it all.
