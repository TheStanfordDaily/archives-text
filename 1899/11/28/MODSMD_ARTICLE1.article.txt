# PICKING THE TEAM.
## Close Contest for Places Makes the Selection Difficult — Excellent Condition of the Men Under Dr. Murphy's Care. 
### 
Assistant Manager Cildersleeve
came up from Del Monte this morn
ing where he witnessed the prac
tices of the team. When interviewed
he was very enthusiastic over the
condition of the men and the
spirit in which they go at the work;
everyone is in good lighting shape
and willing to play. The grounds
are all that could be desired, while
the atmosphere is very bracing.
The men seem to be little tired
when they return from the practice
and the regular habits which are
enforced by Dr. Murphy serve to
keep the men in good shape.
Every morning the men are up
at 7:80 for breakfast and all retire
at 10. Everyone is required to at
tend regularly at meals. Great
credit is due Dr. Murphy for the ex
cellent condition of the men. With
the exception of Murphy, every
one is in good shape. McFadden's
knee is getting stronger and he is
now able to go into the practice
with his usual dash. Cairns has a
bad ankle but is improving rapidly
and is giving Oilman a close tight
for his position. Oilman's shoulder
is now almost well. He wears a
strong brace, which gives it good
protection.
Although the coaches have an
nounced that no line-up will be
officially announced until Thurs
day morning, there are now only a
few doubtful places on the team.
For left end McFadden is probably
a fixture. He excels the other can
didates in tackling, and is strong
in blocking in the line. Treager has
gained his place at left tackle and
will put up an interesting fight
against l'ri: «gle. For left guard
De Forest is conceded the position.
He is light for a guard, but is
speedy and breaks through the line
in good shape. Lee has probably
won the center position over Hay
den, although the latter is still put
ting up a game tight. Lee's super
ior weight is a strong factor in the
contest. For right guard Oilman
and Cairns are about equal, and
will probably divide the honor.
Roth are strong players but are
handicapped somewhat by injuries.
For right tackle "Babe" Rurnett
and Rentley are fighting itout,with
chances in favor of I he former. The
closest contest is fur right end.
Parker, Rice, and Recklev are in
the fight. Parker is in the lead on i
tackling and blocking in the line.
Rice is faster on getting down on
punts and follows the ball well.
Those who have witnessed this
practice say that Parker has been
putting up the best exhibition of
football ever seen on the Const, and
that whether this position goes to
him or to Rice it will be well eared
for in Thursday's game.
Back of the line the contest is
also close. Fisher and Smith are
conceded the halfback positions
by long odds. For quarter the
race has narrowed down to Raitt
and Erb, with the chances favoring
Raitt. Erb is playing a fast game
and backs up tlie line well. Either
he or Raitt would handle the team
in good shape if Captain Murphy

jis unable take part. For full
back the race is between Boren,
Roberts, and Rodolph, with chances
lin the order named. Rorenhas im
proved in punting and interfer
ence. lie is stronger than the
j others in backing up the line and
will probably take the place.
The team will leave Del Monte
tomorrow afternoon and will pass
through I'alo Alto on the 3:0(5
train. The second eleven men will
go direct to San Francisco with the
team and will remain with them
until the game.
The men are in excellent spirits
and always gather in the ballroom
of the hotel to jolly-up after dinner.
Joe De Forest keeps them laughing
with comic recitations and speeches;
Rodolph and Harry Weil furnish
music, while Dr. Murphy and
"Rug" Haslachor amuse the party
with exhibitions in cake-walking.
Coaches Reynolds, Lewers, and
Fickert have returned, and this
leaves Cotton as the only assistant
to Coach Chamberlin.
