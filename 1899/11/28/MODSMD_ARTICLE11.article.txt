In another column is the an
nouncement that cardinal vests are
to be worn all day Thursday, and
not merely at the game, as some
have seemed to think. This plan
should most emphatically be fol

observe it. Before the game, from
the moment the excursion train on
the campus begins to fill, the vest
will be an incentive to enthusiasm,
and the more of them shown the
more enthusiastic we are bound to

go straight from tlie game to the
theater. Hut should mischance
bring defeat, then will come the
test. Will any of us hide our col
ors when it is planned that all
shall wear them? Let victory or
defeat, come which may —we count
only on the former —but do not let
a Stanford man on Thanksgiving
day take off the colors he has once
