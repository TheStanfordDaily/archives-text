# Singing at the Game.
## 
### 
The rooting section will sing on
Thanksgiving day, under the lead
ership of P. K. Oilman, '01, before
the game begins, the following:
1. "Since Cur Roys are Rack
from War."
2. " Shirts Aflame."
3. " Rush the Ball Along."
Upon the entrance of the team,
after the yelling has subsided, "All
Hail the Team " will be sung twice.
There is to he practice in Encina
club-room tonight and tomorrow
night at 7:80. All rooters are
urged to attend. Stanford has never
yet sung successfully on Thanks
giving day, but this year the songs
are known better than heretofore,
and having been practiced, there is
no reason why they should not be
a distinctive feature of the day.
