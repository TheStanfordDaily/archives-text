# MURPHY WILL PLAY.
## There is a General Air of Joy Over the Prospects, as All the Men are in Condition. 
### 
Long before the 3:00 train,
bearing the foot hull squad, was
due from Del Monte this aflerni on
the platform at the Million i:t Palo
Alto was crowd* (1 with students,
waiting to give the football team a
final send-off before the game to
morrow. As the train rolled into
the station it was greeted with the
Stanford yell,followed by "All flail
the Team."
The men were in the rear coach,
which was gaily decorated with
cardinal bunting. The students
then gathered around the car,
shaking hands with the men and
bidding them God-speed The
men were the pictures of perfect
health, and all seemed in excellent
spirits.
The following is an extract from
a letter to a student here, from one
of the squad: ''All the men are in
fine shape and ready to fight.
They realize that they are going
into a hard game, but feel that
they have something up their
sleeves. Parker has won out from
Rice by a hard fight and thus the
left end position is settled.
"itaitt has won the sub-quarter
position, and has been playing ex
cellent ball. Murphy's injured
side improves, and he is doing
good punting, averaging over fifty
yards, while a few went over fifty
five. You can he prepared to see
him play a star giime on Thursday
and he will he in his old-lime form.
His field goal kicking is better than
it was before his injury."
Alfred Haslacher, '00, who has
been with the team at Del Monte
as correspondent for the San Fran
cisco Bulletin, when interviewed
this afternoon as to the team and
its prospects, spoke with unstinted
praise for everybody and every
thing. He believes that our team
is without exception the best that
could represent us this year. Our
1 'ne he considers greatly superior to
Berkeley's, and our backs only
slightly inferior. Our men are in
the best of condition, and every
thing is favorable to the Cardinal.
H. 1). Dumars, '00, who has been
helping " Billy" McLeod with the
rubbin 6 , said that as far as he
can judge from his experience
with this and former teams,
that the condition of the team is
well-nigh perfect. "There will not
be a weak place on the team," he
says. Murphy has been kicking
with apparent ease and his old-time
accuracy and strength.
Both of these men are confident
and say that the team is in the
same condition; not one of over
conlidence but of sturdy self-reli
ance without a trace of nervousness.
They will put up the very best
game that is in them. As for team
work, it is said that a man who
saw the last practice on the grid
iron and the hist one at Monterey
could hardly believe the same men
were in line, so great is the im
