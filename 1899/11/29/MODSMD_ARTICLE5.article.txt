Tomorrow afternoon the Stan
ford Varsity will go into its one
great game of tlie .year, when it
lines up against the California
team in the ninth annual inter
collegiate contest. With the team
we have at present there is ever}'
reason to feel hopeful of the result.
We expect to win, but we are not
confident. Everyman on the team
is made of the proper stuff, and we
can depend upon each to play a
consistent game tomorrow. The
men have worked through the sea
son under great difficulties, Of
last year's team two had returned,
and (if these one will in all proba
bility be unable to take part in the
final contest. With a mass of new
material the coaches went to work,
and have put forth a team which
will be in every sense a credit to
the University. They will go up
against a team which, with but two
exceptions, has played intact for
two seasons, a team which is un
doubtedly the strongest which our
opponents have ever put forth.
But we have faith in our men, and
know that they will light to the
last inch, whether it is victory or
defeat. In passing we cannot say
too much of the excellent work of
our alumni coaches who devoted
much of their time to the instruc
tion of the men. From the begin
ning of the season Coaches Reynolds
mid Lewers were out in the field,
and often went into the line in the
scrimmages. Later Cotton and
Kickert joined the squad of coaches,
and were successful in putting into
the men much of the same spirit
which characterized the players of
their own time. All of this was
done in addition to the regular du
ties of these men, and whether the.
game is won or lost, every man on
the football squad will remember
the services of the alumni coaches
of this season. The men have had
every opportunity to become thor
oughly fitted for the coming con

test in their week's stay at Del
Monte, and although we do not
look for any great surprises in to
morrow's game, we do look for a
close game, and shall expect to see
the Stanford men in the fight until
the last down.
