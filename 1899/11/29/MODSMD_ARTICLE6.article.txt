# Hadley Against Scholarships.
## 
### 
A system of pecuniary assistance
to the theological students at ale
is opposed by Dr. Hadley, the new
president, as indicated in his inaug
ural. Most of the students in the
Yale Divinity School have been at
tracted to the seminary, not only
by its educational advantages, but
also by the fact that its rich endow
ment enables it to give a scholar
ship of $100 a year and free tuition
to every graduate applicant who
has maintained a high stand in the
college from which lie came. Now
President Hadley is averse to the
practice of granting pecuniary aid
of this sort, us is evident front the
following extract from his address :
"Aid in education, if given with
out exacting a corresponding re
turn, becomes demoralizing. If it
is earned by the student as he goes,
it has just the opposite effect This
holds good of graduate scholarships
and fellowships, no less than of un
dergraduate ones. There is no doubt
that in the somewhat indiscrimi
nate competition of different uni
versities anxious to increase the
size, real or apparent, of their grad
uate departments, there has been
an abuse of these appliances which,
unless promptly corrected, threat
ens the future of the teaching pro
fession with an over-abundant in
flux of inferior men."
