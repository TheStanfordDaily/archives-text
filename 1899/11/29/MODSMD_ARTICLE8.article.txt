# Berkeley Players Ruled Off.
## 
### 
Frank Ellis, who has been play
ing quarter-bade in all the prelim
inary games, lias been ruled off as
a professional by the joint faculty
committees of Stanford and the
University of California.
A telegram was received by Dr.
Richardson this afternoon stating
that Captain Whipple of the Berk
eley team had been forbidden to
play on account of deficiencies of
scholarship.
The loss of Ellis leaves Hopper
as the most eligible candidate. He
has, however, an unhappy faculty of
dropping the ball; and unless he
has made much improvement in
this regard within the last year,
Stanford will probably have an ad
vantage through his fumbles.
Clay will take Whipple's place.
While not in the class of Berkeley's
unfortunate Captain, he is, never
theless, a strong player and will
make a hard tight against " Babe"
Burnett.
