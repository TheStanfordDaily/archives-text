Last Thursday afternoon Califor
nia defeated the Varsity by a score
of 30 to 0. This score was a sur
prise to many, but the men who
played the game for us played
against an eleven composed of men
who have played together for
two years. The Stanford eleven
put u)» a game fight and in the sec
ond half held Berkeley to a single
touch-down. California put up a
tierce game in the first half, advanc
ing the ball at every try, and scor
ing four touch-downs, for each of
which Kaarsberg kicked the goal.
In the second half they scored but
once, for, as Coach Chamberlin
said, " The team learned the game
in the (irst half and played it in the
second."
Captain Murphy went into the
game, crippled as he was, and
played as long as he could stand.
This exhibition of grit called forth
the approval of the Berkeley
rooters, while the action of Womble
in jumping upon him after the ball
was down was condemned by the
entire audience. Captain Murphy
has nothing but praise for the te.nn
and says that Stanford should be
proud of the fact that the eleven
played their best until the last
whistle blew. Raitt took Murphy's
position at quarter and played a
good game, making several clever
tackles and backing up the line
well.
Treager at tackle played the best
game on the field, clearl}' outclass
ing his opponent, Pringle. His
tackling and running were excep
tionally good, and he will make in
another year one of the strongest
players on the Coast.
Dr. Jordan has clearly sized up
the situation in articles in the San
Francisco papers 1 Our boys made
a gallant struggle against almost
overwhelming odds. The team
contains the material for a winning
eleven, but the men were green.
The big score California rolled up
in the first half was largely due to
the nervousness of the Cardinal
men. When they steadied down
later on California did not outclass
them as she did in the early play.
California's well-trained players
and concerted action proved too
much for our green men. Rodolph

and Treager will both he valuable
men on next year's team. The
magnificent team work and clever
all-round playing of the Blue and
Gold men entitle them to all the
glory of a well-earned victory."
His criticism of Womble is given
on another page.
"The personnel of the Stanford
eleven in 1 ( J00 will probably be
much the same as that of our pres
ent team. \Ve will lose Murphy
and Parker but the other nine will
be eligible. Coach Chamberlin
did all that man could do to put
a winning team in the field, but the
material was lacking. Dr. Mur
phy, too, did wonders for the men,
and sent every one but Captain
Murphy into the game in perfect
condition. This year California
can rightfully rejoice. Next year
we hope to turn the tables and see
the Cardinal once again floating
victoriously over the gridiron.
"Next to Captain Murphy's won
derful exhibition of grit, Traeger's
tackling was the feature of the
game. He is a man who will in
terfere with the Blue and Gold's
hopes of victory when the teams
meet next Thanksgiving day. A
year's training will make him one
of the strongest players on the
Coast. Rodolph also showed
marked ability during the limited
time he was in the game. The out
looks for a winning team next sea
son are brighter than ever before.
The loss of Captain Murphy, that
indomitable, .sturdy, gritty player
who has probably done more for
the Cardinal than any other one
man, will be a severe blow to us,
however.''
Another reason for the Cardinal's
brace in the second half was proba
bly that the men who went in the
game late had seen the plays from
the side lines and had been able to
figure out how to stop the Berke
ley's plunges better than the men
could who were in the actual mix
ups. Raitt, Cairns, Rodolph, and
Erb played effectively in stopping
the California advance,Rodolph par
ticularly in backing up the line and
putting a quietus on Kaarsberg's
"kangaroo" efforts, and Raitt in
the back field by star tackling.

"The personnel of the Stanford
eleven in 1 ( J00 will probably be
much the same as that of our pres
ent team. \Ve will lose Murphy
and Parker but the other nine will
be eligible. Coach Chamberlin
did all that man could do to put
a winning team in the field, but the
material was lacking. Dr. Mur
phy, too, did wonders for the men,
and sent every one but Captain
Murphy into the game in perfect
condition. This year California
can rightfully rejoice. Next year
we hope to turn the tables and see
the Cardinal once again floating
victoriously over the gridiron.
"Next to Captain Murphy's won
derful exhibition of grit, Traeger's
tackling was the feature of the
game. He is a man who will in
terfere with the Blue and Gold's
hopes of victory when the teams
meet next Thanksgiving day. A
year's training will make him one
of the strongest players on the
Coast. Rodolph also showed
marked ability during the limited
time he was in the game. The out
looks for a winning team next sea
son are brighter than ever before.
The loss of Captain Murphy, that
indomitable, .sturdy, gritty player
who has probably done more for
the Cardinal than any other one
man, will be a severe blow to us,
however.''
Another reason for the Cardinal's
brace in the second half was proba
bly that the men who went in the
game late had seen the plays from
the side lines and had been able to
figure out how to stop the Berke
ley's plunges better than the men
could who were in the actual mix
ups. Raitt, Cairns, Rodolph, and
Erb played effectively in stopping
the California advance,Rodolph par
ticularly in backing up the line and
putting a quietus on Kaarsberg's
"kangaroo" efforts, and Raitt in
the back field by star tackling.
