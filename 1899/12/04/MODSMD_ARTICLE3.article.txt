# CHAMBERLIN ON THE GAME.
## Our Coach Goes Over Last Thursday's Playing and Tells of Stanford's Prospects for Next Yeur. 
### 
Coach Chamberlin, when seen,
said that " After thoughts are bet
ter than first thoughts." He said :
" I expected defeat, but not with a
score like that. Berkeley's team was
a great deal better than I had an
ticipated, and played as one man,
not eleven. They surpassed our
men at every point except kicking,
and I think it is conceded we beat
them at this.
"California was undoubtedly
weaker in the second half than in
the first, and our team was just the
reverse, for the playing in the sec
ond half was almost entirely in
California's territory. The bright
star of hope, which portends good
for the future, was the spirit shown,
not only by the eleven men on the
field, but by the entire student
body. The bleachers gave their
support to a defeated team, and
rooted for them when there was not
the least shadow of hope that they
could score. Spirit like this must
have its result in time.
"The team without exception
played hard and aggressively, and
showed that experience was mainly
what they lacked. Of the men in
the line, Treager and Parker played
the best games. Back of the line,
Raitt, Fisher and Rodolph showed
up best. Although after Captain
Murphy was hurt, he was practi
cally useless as far as playing went,
yet the nerve and grit he displayed
undoubtedly helped the team to
keep together and not get entirely
demoralized.
"The following lines written by a
Stanfordite express better than
anything else the appreciation of
Murphy's staying qualities:
' The Stanford team was sorely hit,
But fame is ours through Murphy's
grit.
The Berkeley team is good, you bet,
But the whole shebang stands
naught to Chet.'
"Although none of the Berkeley
men were taken out of the game,
and three of the Stanford men were
withdrawn, it speaks volumes for
men like Smith and Boren, whom
we know to have been in perfect
physical condition, to have played
so hard that they were compelled
to leave from exhaustion rather
than overtraining or injuries. The
whole team as far as physical con
dition was concerned was perfect.
"If there is one man who should
be singled out for praise above the
rest of the team, it is Treager. All
through the season he has shown
the spirit and determination of do
ing his best, though handicapped by
circumstances which could have
prevented most people from play
ing at all, he kept on uncomplain
ingly. And finally just at the end
of the season, when he was chang
ing from guard's position to tackle,
he kept on in the same determina
tion which resulted in his making
the team and playing what I think
was the best individual game on
the field. And the spirit shown l>y
this freshman only exemplified the
spirit of the whole team.
"There are twelve long months

till next Thanksgiving day and
this will give ample opportunity to
think everything over, and perhaps
to brood a little. In the meantime
I think the most appro riate slo
gan would he that used by the
rooters, 'On to 11)00.'"
