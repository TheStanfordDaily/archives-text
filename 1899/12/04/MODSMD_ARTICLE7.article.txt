We have no reason to feel
ashamed of Thursday's defeat.
The showing made hy our men
against their heavier and more ex
perienced opponents was all that
could have been expected of them.
They fought against heavy odds
and were defeated by a better team.
We have reason to be proud of our
team and to take assurance for
next year's contest. But we should
begin now the preparations for
next year. In the first place, we
should insist upon the return of
Coach Chamberlin and Trainer
Murphy. Probably no coach has
made himself so popular with the
players and student botlv alike as
Chamberlin lias done this season,
and Thursday's game has served
only to increase this admiration.
The coach worked with the team
and did his best to bring a win
ning team out of the raw material
he had to work with. The excel
lent work of Dr. Murphy was
shown when the men made their
strong stand in the second half;
not one was in poor condition, but
every one was trained down to the
proper shape at the time of the
game. Dr. Murphy will remain
with us during the baseball and
track season and will have a fur
ther opportunity to show his
ability as a trainer. It would be
hard to find the men in whom the
players would have greater confi
dence than Coach Chamberlin
and Dr. Murphy, and with their
guidance for next year we will have
every reason to feel confident of
the results. But the experience of
this season has shown the neces
sity of better training facilities on
the campus. With a training
house fitted up in proper shape
the expense of a Del Monte trip
would be done away with and the
men would not be compelled to
throw aside their University work
during the last week of practice.
The committee having in charge
the preparations for the training
house will push the matter from
now on, and it should have the co
operation of the entire student
body to make the project a success.
