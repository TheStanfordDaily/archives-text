There is no need of belittling
Berkeley's clear-cut victory of last
Thursday. The score of 30-0 tells
the story of an overwhelming de
feat, California out-playing Stan
ford at almost every point. We
have no regrets about the game ex
cept some that have already been

voiced by the general public and
the press of San Francisco. The
sportsmanship of playing a man
barred by the faculty of their col
lege, when the opponents had filled
all necessary requirements of
scholarship, is a matter that can
be left to U. C. to decide. If the
athletic reputation of the institu
tion can stand the accusation that
a man has only to be able to play
football, and can do so without
regard to the college curriculum,
that is the institution's outlook.
It is a good way to attract football
players. Hut one matter for which
we are extremely sorry is that a
football star of such magnitude as
Womble, easily the cleverest end
on the field. that day, should so
mar the effects of his brilliant play

by the foul tactics he used in con
tinued holding. And more than
all, by his deliberate efforts to put
Stanford's injured captain out of
the game by jumping on him when
he was clear out of the play with
the ball thirty yards down the
field, VVomble made his name syn
onymous with "dirty" playing.
Of course that such a thing could
have been done, and done repeat
edly, was the fault largely of the
officials. For that there is no re
dress. If the umpire can stand
such published statements as that
of T. K. Code, captain of the Olym
pics, a man who has followed
Coast football for a good many
years, in the Examiner, we can.
He says:
"The umpiring was the worst
ever seen in Ban Francisco. Time
and again the umpire had a chance
to rule men off the lield, and give
penalties for holding, but he did
not do so.' 7
Dr. Jordan in published state
ments does not hesitate to speak
his mind on this point:
"The action of one California
man still rankles in the hearts of
the Stanford players. The un
sportsmanlike behavior of (be end
who deliberately jumped on Cap
tain Murphy who was lying pros
trate on the ground is deserving of
the severest censure. A Harvard
player who was guilty of such con
duct in a recent contest was put
out of the game by his captain.
Similar punishment in the case
under discussion would have been
but just, I think. The unwar
ranted action of the end looked
like a deliberate attempt to put
Murphy out of the game."
We do not seek to detract from
the glory of Berkeley's victory, nor
to condone Stanford's defeat. It
was a famous victory. It was a
crushing defeat. In black and
white we acknowledge it. And
while we Berkeley all praise
for excellent team-work and dash
and spirit, we consider the methods
of one of her players as altogether
blatnable and unworthy.
