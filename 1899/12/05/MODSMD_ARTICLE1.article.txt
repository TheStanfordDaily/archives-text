## Notes Gathered by Students in Engineering, Relating to Their Department. 
### 
Every Tuesday this column will
be dev ted to the interests of the
following Engineering departments:
Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Mechan
ical, and Mining or Geology. Every
one in these departments is re
quested to furnish the editor of
their department with any news
that will be of interest to engineers.
The copy must be in the editor's
hands by noon each Tuesday. Fol
lowing are the editors for the var
ious departments: Chemical, Town
send.'oo; Civil, Kreen; Electrical,
Coldwell, '01; Mechanical, E. S.
Ayres, '97; Mining or Geology,
W. Q. Wright, '00.
—A core oven has been in suc
cessful operation in the University
foundry this semester.
—A large cupola, a furnace used
to melt cast-iron, has been erected
in the foundry. The blast-pipe
connections will be finished at once,
and next semester the furnace will
be in operation.
—There are live candidates for
graduation this year, eight juniors,
thirty-six sophomores and fresh
men, with a total of forty-nine
students, in the Electrical Engi
neering department.
—W. M. Parkin, *'01, has
presented to the Mechanical Engi
neering department a very interest
ing collection of specimens illustra
tive of the entire process of tin
plate making as carried on in the
works of the Crescent Steel Co.
— Mr. Curtis H. Lindley of San
Francisco has consented to deliver
two lectures before the Associated
Engineers' Society during next
semester. His subject will be Irri
gation, and as it is a popular one
all interested are invited to attend.
— A committee of the Engineer
ing faculties has investigated the
needs of a school of engineering
based upon .500 as an ultimate
number of students. Their conclu
sions are embodied in a report
which is now in the hands of Pres
ident .Jordan.
—There has been considerable
improvement in the Electrical lOn
gineering department this year.
Courses have been re-arranged,
books and instruments purchased,
and new cases constructed for the
protection of the instruments.
Among the new instruments area
hot wire ammeter reading up to
100 Amp. for either direct or alter
nating currents, and a 1,000.000
ohm resistance box for delicate
and accurate cable testing. This
instrument is a valuable addition
to the laboratory.
