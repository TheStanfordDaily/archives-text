What hits become of the Press
Club? We have not heard of this
organization this .semester, and
there is no apparent reason why it
should have found less to do since
the University opened last Sep
tember than it had theretofore. If
journalistic work is to improve at
Stanford —and why labor if we
cannot improve? —the Press Club
should certainly he the leader. Is
this paper the best it could be? Is
the Sequoia, our annuals, our cor
respondence in the San Francisco
dailies? Let us get together in
the Press Club and talk these
things over and, perhaps, have the
customary annual banquet.
