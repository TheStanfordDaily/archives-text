Stanford has good football pro
spects for next year. California
will have but four men of this
year's Thanksgiving team. Stan
ford will have fourteen men with
varsity experience. Coach Cham
herlin has built up here this season
a football squad such as Walter
Camp founded for future big scores.
These men were mostly beginners
this season, but they have the right
spirit. That was shown in the way
they went into the first game they
had ever played together as a team.
It required a disastrous first half
for them to learn how to oppose
California's veterans, and then
with the exception of the first few
minutes in the second half they
proved a stand-off for their older
and far more â€¢ experienced oppo
nents. Stanford's 20-0 team was
merely an aggregation of long
practiced players, part of them old
second eleven men of several sea
sons. But practically all that
team happened to remain in the
University another year. Then it
was a victorious team, perfected
and sent against the California
survivors of the former defeat com
bined with some new material.
That perfected and experienced

team won 28-0 and then was dis
persed by graduation and enlist
ment for service in the Philippines.
Only remnants were left to face
California's men, who had been
taking the Stanford medicine with
a very wry face. But that medi
cine was good for them. They
came on the Thanksgiving field in
1898 with hard-earned knowledge
of the game and defeated the Stan
ford collection of remnants 22-0.
Then they remained in college
another year and perfected their
team. We know the rest. They
won 30-0, and now seven of them
will disperse. Both universities
have had their turns with this sort
of rise, perfection, and dissolution
of mighty scoring teams. Stanford
has been relearning the old lesson
tirst set by Walter Camp: build up
a strong second eleven; it is the
source of your future Varsity.
What recruits California may re
ceive each year can be pretty nearly
predicted in advance. They almost
invariably come from this State
and generally from the preparatory
schools that have football teams
with men that are known. Stan
ford, as shown in the initial
Thanksgiving line-up in which
were six from California, three from
Oregon, and two from Colorado,
draws material from afar and has
unknown possibilities aside from
preparatory school material from
this State.
