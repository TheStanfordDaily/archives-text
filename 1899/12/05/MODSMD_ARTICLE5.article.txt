# FALL CONDITIONING.
## An Outline of the Method of Gymnasium Training in Connection With Track Work. 
### 
Mr. T. A. Storey, Instructor in
the Gymnasium, has given the fol
lowing outline of the work in the
Gymnasium in connection with
training for the track:
We plan, as far as possible,
to fit our gymnasium exercises to
the needs of each individual. In
order to accomplish such an end,
the needs of the student must be
learned and the special influence of
different exercises upon him must
be understood. There are, then,
two conditions —the student and
the work.
We study the student—first,
tlirough a record of his personal
history, in as far as he is able and
willing to furnish such information;
second, by means of anthropomet
ric and photographic measure
ments; third, by means of a physi
cal, and—where necessary or de
sired —a medical diagnosis of his
particular organic condition; and,
lastly, he is studed in his daily ac
tivities in the gymnasium as closely
as is possible under our rather un
favorable equipment for such obser
vation. So much for the study of
the individual.
With such data as we are able to
get from these sources, we attempt
to select for application the best ex
ercises at our disposal. A rnong the
three hundred or more men using
the gymnasium there are three
hundred or more special cases, but
it is possible to divide this number
roughly into three groups which
merge into each other and repre
sent the extremes of development
and the medium lying between the
two. There is a group on the one
side that is composed of men more
or less organically weak; there is
the group on the other side that is
composed of men organically strong
and of more than average develop
ment; and lying between the two
there is a third group that repre
sents what may be called a condi
tion of average organic strength and
development. It would be impos
sible in a limited space to outline
our directions to particular indi
viduals. The groupings given above
will serve far better to explain our
general plan in the application of
exercise.
We try to fit our work to the
needs of the individual student, and
the in-door and out-door work may
be roughly divided into three
grades, made to fit the three larger
groups of students which are found
in the gymnasium. Remember,
though, this division is more or less
artificial. It is not real.
We find in the application of
uymnastic exercises that the ten
dency of apparatus work is toward
the special development of certain
parts. The typical gymnast tapers
from his shoulders to his heels. 11 is
trunk exceeds his legs greatly in de
velopment.
Lack of proportion is not desir
able, nor does it harmonize with
our plans for the application of ex
ercise to fit the special needs of the
student. In order to avoid dispro
portionate development, as far as
possible, we emphasize one variety
of work and slight another. For

these reasons we play as much hand
ball as possible; we use the horse
, and buck and slight the parallel bars
j for instance. But the out-door
! work is the great counter-influence
upon which we depend. There
(have been over iifty gymnasium
| men on the gridiron at 'liftwmnt
times this semester; mere will he
nearly as many m the track squad
next semester. Every man in the
gymnasium gets out-doors on the
track at least once a week through
out the year. We hope to give each
J man plenty of fresh air; a good
pair of lungs; a good pair of legs,
and a good measure of endurance.
The out-of-door work is carried
on under the directions of cap
able men. We are not trying to
make expert track and field men,
but we do want the work done in
the best possible form and to the
greatest advantage of the individ
ual.
On days that will permit you may
see a squad of men trying the
hurdles; another "starting from
scratch"; a third jumping, and so
on. At the same time you will see
a group of men tilling up on good
air—covering the track at an ordi
nary walk. These tnen do gymna
sium work as legitimate, and as ac
ceptable, as the work of the big fel
low who puts the sixteen-pound shot
or the man who is laying the foun
dation for a record in the hundred.
