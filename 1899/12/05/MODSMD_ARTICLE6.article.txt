# Carl Hayden Leaves.
## 
### 
Carl T. Hayden, '00, left the
University today for his home in
Tetnpe, Arizona, on account of the
serious illness of his father. He is
to take charge of his father's large
milling interests there, and will
probably not return to the Univer
sity at all, and at least not for over
a year. My his leaving the Uni
versity loses one of its hest and
most representative students, a man
who has won for himself an en
viab'e place in the regard of his
fellow students. His game fight
for center position on the Varsity
this year, and his uncomplaining
acquiescence when, after he had
played in every preliminary con
test, he was finally beaten out for
the place by Lee, are too well
known and appreciated to need
comment here. He was a Varsity
debater, being our representative
on the Carnot last year, and alter
nate on the Intercollegiate. All of
his friends express the hope that
his return to the University will be
much sooner than lie expects.
