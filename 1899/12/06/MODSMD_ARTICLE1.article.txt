# "THE BRITISH EMPIRE."
## A 						Lecture on a Lesson in Imperialism by Professor Ross in the Chapel Last Night. 
### 
Professor Ross prefaced his re
marks with the telling of his im
pressions of the English people.
He spoke particularly of their char
acter as English people, as people
of the same race and life, a state
of affairs which we in America on
account of our mixed population
cannot have and can hardly under
stand. There is an extreme, almost
country-like, simplicity and ease
even in London, especially striking
after a visit to Paris. The English
people are like us in many ways,
in courage, in courtesy, in regard
for women and for athletic sports.
They are unlike us in many ways,
they are more reticent and more
conventional. Theirs is a greater
social deference, with much less
sense of equality, hut the leader
and the led are in different relation
than in this country.
The economic conditions of Eng
land must not he lost sight of.
Five-sixths of her bread stuffs, two
thirds of all meats, and two-fifths
of the dairy products come from
across the seas. England secures
her enormous food supply in ex
change for manufactures that buy
her bread.
We are apt to speak of the
United States as a great nation,
but at every point we must stand
back before the magnitude of the
British Empire. Queen Victoria
rules over nearly one-fourth of the
population of the world, and more
than that, the marvelous growth is
going on today, and in a thousand
directions the active advance of
Britain's interests is being carried
out. As a necessity for her manu
facturing interests, to win markets,
England has to reach out to mould
the tastes of her buyers, in order
that her trade shall have a chance
to grow. The need of an outlet for
surplus population and surplus
products has made England stretch
her sway over many peoples.
But in the last few years a third
reason for England's domination
has arisen: It is a sentiment of
imperialism, although England is
a peaceful nation at heart. Not
that she is not willing to light. She
is ready for that, but she does not
seek it. But ibis new ideal of "do
minion over palm and pine" is the
result of an argument, that the
final disposition of the peoples and
lands of the world is at hand, and
Britain should, for moral reasons
if for no others, be the leader in
the new departure. England gives
new life to her conquered provinces,
good government, and better jus
tice.
On the other hand, there is a
tendency to make the interests of
the country subserve the ends of
British merchants rather than the
needs of the natives. And in In
dia the civil list shows a great ma
jority of English officials, ; >t a
much higher rate of salary than
tlnit obtained by the native officers.
At home, England's imperialism
impoverishes her schools ; her war
vessels take her revenues. Her
armies, too, will take her best
voting men, and before long the

troops for her conquests, perhaps
even for the Boer war at present,
will have to be raised by conscrip
tion. And the present state of im
perialism tends to unduly strength
en the executive power. Empire
makes the executive more secret,
more powerful, and more indepen
dent of the legislative branch of
government.
The future of the Empire by the
present system of expansion is in a
most precarious state. If England
can hold together for the coming
period of stress which she will have
to face, her position as the world
leader will be assured, but this per
iod of stress is likely to prove dis
astrous. Her colonies and depen
dencies cannot now be relied upon
to protect and maintain the British
Empire. Until all of the compon
ent parts are federated, Britain is
in danger.
There are two nations that alone
can shatter the prospects of Great
Britain. One is the United States,
the other is Russia. The whole of
North America could by conquest
come under the Stars and Stripes
from the Gulf to the Arctic. But
this is beyond the conception of
man to believe, because English
and American interests and senti
ment are too closely amalgamated.
Russia can, however, especially in
the East, shatter all of Britain's
hopes and ambitions, for inasmuch
as " Brittania rules the waves" the
Muscovite has the upper hand in
land forces, and while England can
hardly stretch her power farther
than the guns of her battleships
can carry, Russia can send her Cos
sacks where she will, and the trans-
Siberian railway is an important
factor in this regard.
A coalition of the other powers
could bring England to her knees,
for England while an impregnable
fortress is an unprovisioned one,
and a naval blockade that could
cut off the food supply of the Brit
ish Isles would be as effective a
conquest of England as a bloody
war waged throughout the land.
Germany and France are at heart
enemies of England, as England
has too long wanted all the spoils
and all the glory for herself alone.
There is talk of«ui Anglo-Ameri
can Alliance, but we should note
the time when and from whom the
proposals for such alliance come.
They come from the Army and
Navy, and from Society, with a cap
ital " S" ; they come after the world
has seen the mettle of our fighting
men at Manila and Santiago. But
an alliance is a matter of interest
and not of friendship, and ai lough
there are no doubts that a funda
mental friendship dots exist be
tween England and America, an
alliance means that we fight battles
for England, wright or wrong. It
would help England not at all ; it
would hurt us. And we have no
need of help.
In the future the smaller coun
tries of the world will more and
more be eliminated from the maps.
And the scramble for the partition
is going on. America wants no
place in that. It should be sulli
cient for us to stand for the things
that we have made ourselves note
worthy for, — the education of deaf
mutes, the caring for the insane,

the giving of liberal educations.
When Thomas Garlyle once asked,
<l What has America done?" some
one answered, " She has educated a
woman who was deaf, dumb, and
blind, so that she could support
herself and send a barrel of flour
for the starving poor in Ireland."
It is for this sort of thing that
America should stand.
In the last year the American
nation has been taken to the top of
a great mountain and shown the
nations of the world, with the
promise that it should have of them
what it pleased. " But this," con
cluded Professor Ross, " is a temp
tation of Satan, and I, for one, do
not think we can yield to it."
