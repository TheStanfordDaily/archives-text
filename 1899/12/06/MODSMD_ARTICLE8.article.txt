It now becomes (be 'rooter's"
part to use his influence quietly
unci thoughtfully toward keeping
every athlete in the University.
This can be done in certain indi
vidual cases by making it less dif
ficult for the man to study, by
avoiding those things that result in
neglected work, by persuading a
man to forego a city trip or a so
cial function when his time should
be given strict-ly to certain scholas
tic duties. The "good fellow" who
helps to talk the night away, the
convivial fellow who proposes a
jaunt to Maylield, the room-mate
who has done his work or is carry
ing an easier course and seems to
be taking things carelesslyâ€”all
such tend to the elimination from
college of other men with whom
they come in direct contact. Think
of these things, and reflect that
your influence may win or lose a
man from the'varsity.
