On account of the fact that sev
eral members of the student body
did not recognize the Varsity track
shirt as an athletic emblem, it was
recently decided to add a German
<l S," to be worn only by men who
had represented Stanford against
Berkeley in an intercollegiate track
and (ield contest. Several years
ago a red sweater was typical of
the second team football man, until
it became necessary that an addi
tional emblem be added to keep
the unsuspecting public from giv
ing undue homage to every wearer
of a cardinal sweater. One year a
Roman numeral was used, and
then came the adoption of the reg
ular German U S" for second team
men. This change to an exact and
unmistakable emblem w;is a wise
one, as it gives honor where honor
is due, and still allows the under
graduate who is not athletically
inclined to proudly wear the colors
of his Alma Mater. Hut the ath
letic committee of last, year set

aside a certain cap as d Varsity
emblem, distinctive as such. That
a man should wear this cap with
out having won it is a breach of
college athletic ethics, ami the
wearer deserves as severe a "calling
down" as can be meted out to him.
It is not often that such cases h rise,
but when they do, either from the
dense ignorance or blatant self-suf
ficiency of the offender who mas
querades under false colors, there
is only one course left, and that is
to inform the individual in no
equivocal terms of the enormity of
his offense and the contempt it be
gets.
