# ATHLETIC CHANGES.
## The 						Faculty Athletic Committees of the Two Universities Make Important Rulings. 
### 
Rumors have been circulated of
a number of provisions regarding
the future athletic policy to be
pursued by the two universities
which were adopted by the two
athletic committees. When inter
viewed this afternoon Professor
Richardson said that nothing dt-li
nite had been done by the commit
tees and that nothing would be
known until the faculty council
meets at Berkeley tomorrow after
noon. According to the reports
that have been circulated, Eastern
coaches will be prohibited, the
Thanksgiving game will be done
away with, and the final intercol
legiate match will be played on the
university campuses. But as Pro
fessor Richardson has said: ''Noth
ing has been done, it is all in the
air." It is reasonably certain that
something is doing and the out
come will be anxiously awaited.
Whatever may be done, it is cer
tain that the faculty committees
are working for the best interests
of the athletics of the universities
and the changes are made with
this end in view.
