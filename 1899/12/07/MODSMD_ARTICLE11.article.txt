The officers of the Sophomore
Class are working hard to pay off
the class debt, and every sopho
more in college should do his part
towards raising the sum needed.
The debt as it stands is over thirty
three dollars, and it is imperative
that it should be settled now, as
with next semester will come
added expenses. If every man and
woman of the class will pay his or
her assessment at oncs, the ac
counts can be settled, and the cJass
start in next semester free from
debt.
