We cannot help commenting on
and commending the way the
Berkeley Occident treated the
Thanksgiving day game in her
athletic and editorial departments
alike. To us it seems that they
took a fair and unbiased view of
things in general: they rejoice in
their glorious score and the way
their men played as a team. The
Whipple case is discussed at some

length, nnd with sound sense, l>ut
such a case lias not arisen at
►Stanford and we can hardly appre
ciate the attitude of the California
student body and faculty when
called upon to deal with it. The
stand taken in the editorial in this
paper last Monday expresses the
general sentiment here regarding
such a case as Whipple's. Hut to
revert to the Occident: particu
larly grateful to us is the following:
We knew we had the best team
and we expected them to win. And
so, as they rolled up the score, we
shouted for California, the team,
Captain Whipple and —Captain
Murphy. . .
In the big game the student body
as a unit was sorry that the Stnn
-1 ford captain could not go into the
j game physically sound, and when
he was compelled to leave the lield
none regretted it more than the
i wearers of the Blue and Gold.
Those cheers given him by our
boys were worth a dozen given in
celebrating the victory.
And so, taking the se.-ison as a
whole, we may wish for many such
football years as '99.
The athletic write-up wo give in
another column, and it strikes us
as quite fair, and the reference to
fouling we cannot cavil at.
