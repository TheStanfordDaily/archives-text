# The 						"Occident" on the Game.

### 
We clip from the Berkeley
weekly the following portions of
the department of "Athletics" that
have a particular reference to Stan
ford:
''Somewhere,between the first and
second half, Stanford took a tre
mendous brace, and went on the
lield determined to win, and that if
they couldn't score, they would
bold California down ; and they
did, though it is only fair to ex
plain away some of Stanford's good
showing here by stating that a poor,
sandy, soggy field and the hercu
lean labors of our runners and pile
drivers and jumpers in the first
half had robbed them of the best
part of their ground-gaining pow
ers, and that the kicking resulted
generally in loss through our par
tial disabling of our star " Pete,"
who was kicked in the temple and
dazed for most of the second half.
"Still, in the first ten minutes,we
managed to add our fifth and last
touch-down and goal to the glorious
score. After our kick off and re
turn, Stanford gave us a surprise
by holding us on downs for the first
time in the game. Hardly had we
Caught our breath from this shock,
when Stanford's Smith dashed
around Hill for 22 yards—the long
est run of the day so far. Then
we held the Cardinal. Next, on a
fake-kick, "Pete" made his bril
liant 50 yard run, aided by the
cleverest of interference, as wel 1 as
by his own remarkable miming
and dodging powers. An off-side
play gave us 10 yards and line
plugging sent us the other 15 yards
and over.
" This finished our part in the per
formance. Stanford savagely put
us on the defensive and we had all
we could attend to. Only once
were we even in Stanford territory,
when by steady, straight plunging
for 65 yards, we brought the ball
up to their 25-yard line only to
lose it. The Cardinal can boast a

belter showing. Invariably gain
ing on their kicks—Boren sup
planted by Rodolph —they worked
up to our 80-yard line twice, to our
20-yard line once, and to our 15-
yard line once —only to lose the
ball each time through exasperat
ing repetitions of our matchless de
fensive work. The last time Stan
ford planted the ball only 8 yards
from our goal, but that was her
best. She had made a game strug
gle, but the odds were too great. In
the last of the light Smith of Stan
ford gave out, and "Billy" Erb
took bis place.
"The less said by either side about
fouling and rough play will be ap
preciated by the unbiased public,
who could see as plainly as officials
and athletic experts that both sides
were guilty of these errors."
