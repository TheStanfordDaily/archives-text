# Carlisle-Berkeley Game.
## 
### 
Manager Mumu of the Univer
sity of California football team
is trying to make arrangements to
play the famous Carlisle Indian
team in San Francisco on Christ
mas day. Whether the game will
come off rests entirely with the
Berkeley team, as the Indians sent
word that they are willing to come
out. Ho far the Berkeley men have
rebelled against the idea, for they
are worn out by the unusually long
season they have just completed.
Hall, Womble, and Pringle are
leading the opposition to the pro
ject. Coaches Kelly and Cochran
have promised to stay and see the
game through.
This game would be of great in
terest, and would furnish the first
and only real basis of comparing
the football of the East and West.
Car isle beat Pennsylvania and
Cornell, scored 10 points to Har
vard's 22, and beat Columbia 44 to
0. Hudson, their quarter-back,
kicked a lield goal in almost every
game he played. He kicked a lield
goal from the 53-yard line in the
Columbia game.
