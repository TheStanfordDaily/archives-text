# Faculty Abolishes Summer Schools.
## 
### 
The Faculty Council has just
made an important announcement
relative to summer school work.
Hereafter University credit will be
given only for work done in resi
dence at the University. If work
prescribed by instructors be such
I that it cannot be done at the Uni
[ versity, or can be done to better ad
i vantage elsewhere, such work will
I be regarded as done in residence.
Such special work must be duly
registered in advance, and must be
included in the thirty-six hours
permitted for any calendar year.
This decision puts an end to all
summer school work, with the ex
ception of that carried on at the
Hopkins Laboratory at Monterey.
Dr. Elliot, in speaking of the matter
today, said that the committee had
| had its action under advisement for
some time, and that the decision had
. been reached after careful consider-
I ation. Dr. Jordan is heartily in

favor of the move, as he has been
opposed to the summer school ever
since its removal from the campus.
The Faculty feel that the work
done during the summer has not
been up to the University standard,
and on the whole, has not been sat
isfactory. Dr. Elliott intimated
that the discontinuation of the
summer school is the first move
towards the plan of holding an all
year's session of the University, as
is done at the University of Chi
cago, and which was outlined by
President Harper in his talk before
the students here last spring. This
decision of the Faculty makes it
impossible for a student to accom
plish more than thirty-six hours 1
work a year, including University
and such special work as may be
permitted by the Faculty.
