# CARNOT FINALS.
## The 						Selection of Stanford's Intercollegiate Carnot Debating Team. 
### 
The four representatives of the
Cardinal in the annual intercol
legiate Carnot Debate will be chosen
by a final try-out in the chapel
next Saturday evening. Owing to
the absence of llayden, '00, from
the University, anil the declination
of Edlin, '02, there will be but six
contestants. These, however, rep
resent the result of a year's work
ing of our new debating system,
and the contest between them is
sure to he close and spirited.
Professors Fetter, lioss, and New
comer, who were judges in the semi
finals, will act in the same capacity
at the finals. There will be two
debates, each with three partici
pants. Each speaker must divide
his time between two speeches.
The first question will be: "Re
solved, That the French Cabinet
Ministers should he responsible to
the President alone, as in the United
States."
L. B. Wilson, '00, leads upon the
affirmative. He is a Law major, a
member of Euphronia, and has had
considerable experience in Univer
sity debating. Those who are ac
quainted with his ability predict
much future success for him.
J. F. English, '01, follows, speak
ing also upon the affirmative. Eng
lish is a Law major, and a repre
sentative of Philolexian,and among
Stanford debaters none have been
more conscientious in their work
than he.
C. M. Marrack, '01, is the only
speaker on the negative of the ques
tion. He represents Euphronia.
and is an English major. Marrack
prepared at St. Matthew's, and has
taken an active interest in debating
throughout his University career.
The second debate is upon the
question: "Resolved, That the
French Cabinet Ministers should
be excluded from seats in Parlia
ment."
Charles Quayle, '00, speaks first,
upon the negative of the question.
Quayle's major is Law. lie has
been identified with debating here
for several years, both in Philo
lexian, of which he is a member,and
in University conti t-ts.
Miss Anna G. Fraser, '00, fol
lows upon the affirmative. Miss
Fraser is a History major and has
gained much success in previous
intercollegiate try-outs.

is .J. E. Springer, 00, upon the
negative. Springer is an Eco
nomics major, a member of Eu
phronia, and has been before the
debating world for the last year as
our most promising representative,
and he is com ted upon by many
to bring intercollegiate victory this
year to Stanfoid.

will announce the make up of the
team. A larye attendance of stu
dents is desired as it, is the last
opportunity this semester of show
ing a general interest in debating.
