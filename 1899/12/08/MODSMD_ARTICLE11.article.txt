It is not inappropriate at the
close of the semester to call atten
tion to the advantage of a vigorous
support of the Students' Guild next
spring by the students at large
The field of this institution has
been broadening during the last
year and a test is being made of
the advantage and desirability of
the maintenance of a professional
nurse on the campus, tilie has
proved of invaluable assistance in
particular cases. The question for
the students to decide is whether
they can afford to let the matter of
a small fee each semester interfere
with what everyone concedes to be
very desirable if not a necessity in
cases of emergency. What the
nurse means to students unfortu
nate enough to become seriously
ill at the University and how
much benefit the Guild can be to
needy members has been shown in
the past. Let the students give
their financial support by becom
ing members, as well as their
moral support, and the work will
continue and an adequate student
insurance company ultimately be
established.
