The omission at the meeting this
afternoon to propose student body
candidates for the intercollegiate
debating try-outs may perhaps be
excusable on account of lack of
time. There was something of a
spirit of impatience shown when
the matter was brought up which,
we think, was entirely unjustifia
ble. Jt may be hard for some to
drop from the exciteinent of foot
ball contests to the preparatory
debating work, but it is something
which has to be done. Now till
the evening of the field-day, debat
ing will predominate among inter
collegiate contests. How necessary
it is for Stanford to reap the full
benefit of her debating innovations
all of us realize. Yet are not all of us

willing to encourage this success in
every possible way? In past years
nomination by the student body
has been a much sought after honor
among debaters and has been an
incentive for much good work. It
is unjustifiable to drop precedents
of so many years standing without
good cause, and this, we believe, in
this case has not been shown to
exist. It is only through competi
tion for places on the team that
the best representatives can be
finally chosen, and the attempts of
a certain few to prevent such com
petition in order that their chances
of making the team may be bet
tered thereby is an action which
should be most strongly condemned.
Every person who has ability in
debating should be encouraged to
enter the preliminary contest, and
when men adopt the method of
discouragement it looks much like
placing personal ambition ahead
of Alma Mater.
