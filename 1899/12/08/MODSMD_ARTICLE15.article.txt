### 
A number of students are suffer
ing from the effect of poison oak,
and l)r. T. 1). Wood has provided
the Palo Alto with the following
points fur guidance in avoiding
the plant and the effect of its virus:
Poison oak is a shrub growing in
one slender stalk,straight from the
ground, about as high as a currant
bush. It does not necessarily
grow in groups, although it may be
thickly scattered over a considera
ble area. The plant is difficult to
distinguish when the leaves are off.
The leaves are a bright green in
spring and in the fall are colored
from pink to yellow and red. The
leaf has three lobes, or rather, looks
like three little leaves grouped on
the end of a stem.
The poison of the shrub is an
oily resin, secreted from the leaves,
branches, and roots, and is most
virulent in early spring. This ma
terial can be conveyed by direct
contact, transference by one object
to a third, or the dust wherein the
dry resin may be deposited. Thus
people are poisoned indirectly and
a person may get attack after at
tack from the same coat or shirt.
The poison does not affect all per
sons equally, some it does not
affect at all, but it is always better
to use care while in the domain of
the plant.
The inflammation in the skin is
caused by the oily resin, and if re
moved the inflammation ceases but
the soreness provoked must take
its natural course in recovering.
The poison is best removed by
washing with hot water and strong
soap, and then rubbing with pure
alcohol all exposed parts. This
will dissolve the poison, and by
taking these simple precautions af
ter a trip in the hills, students may
save themselves a great deal of pain
and discomfort. In any case this
simple application should be made
before any ointments are applied
as they only serve to distribute the
poison oil if an} 7 remains in the
skin.
For the treatment of the inflam
mation there are various things,
but no specific. It is important to
keep the inflammation soft, proper
ly protected from cold air, and not
subjected to very strong medicines.
After one or two attacks people are
more susceptible to the poison but
it does not get into the blood.
