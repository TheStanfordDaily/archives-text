# Christmas "Daily Palo Alto."
## 
### 
The special Christmas edition of
the Daily Palo Alto announced
in yesterday's editorial column
promises, although a new depar
ture for the paper, to be a valuable
issue in many ways and as a prec
edent for future years it will be
doubly worthy. Formerly there
was a period of two weeks before
the end of the term, a period par
ticularly full of news,when, accord
ing to old custom, in order to give
the editors a much-needed rest, the
paper was not issued. These last
two weeks are generally the busiest
and therefore the newsiest of the
whole semester. This year, with
the student body elections so late,
and the probable athletic agree
ment still unsettled,there are defin
ite news items the University wants
to know and wants a record of.
Next Thursday's Christmas edi
tion, then, will contain the news of
the elections for editor-in-chief of
the Daily Palo Alto, and football
manager, and football captain.
There will also be news of other
football happenings that are yet in
the air. The treasurer's report will
be published, giving details of the
receipts and expenditures of the
big game. A resume and forecast
of tlie work of the Women's Ath
letic Association, Mrs. Stanford's
expression as to the new buildings
and the University's prospects, the
proposed Glee Club Tour, and other
items will complete the news part.
Special articles on athletics, publi
cations, debating, etc.,will be given.
There will he several half-tones, in
cluding pictures of the old and
new football captains, and alto
gether the issue will he a valuable
one. Single copies will be sold for
ten cents. Subscribers will get
their copies without extra charge.
Orders for this issue may be left at
this office, or at the Bookstore.
