# GLEE CLUB TOUR.
## Musical Organizations Will Take a Trip to Southern California. 
### 
The University Glee and Mando
lin Clubs, consisting of twenty-six
men, are on the eve of their fifth
annual concert tour, which will in
clude this year, as two years ago,
concerts in the principal cities of
Southern California. The trip will
consume the entire vacation, begin
ning next Thursday, Dec. 21st, and
ending about Jan. 10th. The clubs
will leave Palo Alto Thursday
morning and go to San Luis Obispo,
where the first entertainment will
be given in the evening. From
San Luis Obispo they will play at
Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Ang
eles, San Diego, Santa Ana, Pasa
dena, Riverside, Redlands, San
Bernardino, Pomona. On the re
turn trip the organizations will
probably be booked in Bakersfield,
Tulare, Fresno, Hanford, Merced,
Stockton. The South is anxious
to have the Stanford organizations
again and is preparing an old-time
welcome.
The clubs are both well trained
and in excellent condition. They
will be weakened somewhat on the
tour by the absence of some impor
tant members who at the last mo
ment are unable to go. The Glee
will sing a better class of music
than ever before, and the Mandolin
Club has many bright and new
things. Besides the regular num
bers, Frank Branch Riley, leader
of the Glee Club, will as usual add
a taking feature to the club's per
formance by his clever monologues
and sketches. " Fido" Corbusier is
expected to do something, and B.A.
Olshausen, who plays the flute so
well in the Mandolin Club, will
have a number of his own.
