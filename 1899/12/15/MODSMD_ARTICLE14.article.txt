The decision of the Faculty Ath
letic Committee in regard to inter
collegiate banket-ball contests will
be regretted by many of the stu
dents who have always had a great
interest in the game, and who have
looked forward to seeing again a
game between a Stanford and a
Berkeley team. The first and only
intercollegiate game took place in
'96, and then the Stanford girls
brought home the ball. Since that
time no arrangements for a contest
could be agreed upon by the repre
sentatives of the two universities.
We acceded in '96 to the Berkeley's
request that we play inside. Berke
ley would not the next year or since
accede to our request to play outside,
so that no game could be arranged.
Now, when Berkeley has an out
of-door contest, and the prospects
for an intercollegiate contest were
the brightest that they have been
for years, comes the faculty decision
emphatically prohibiting all such
contests. From the stand they
take, that of health, the committee
of course is right, and no one will
say that the strain which a girl "is
under during a contest of much mo
ment will work her any great good.
But the disappointment is not made
any the lees keen.
