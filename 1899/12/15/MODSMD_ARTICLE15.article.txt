In connection with the discussion
of the proposed intercollegiate
agreement comes an expression
from the Athletic Committee of a
desire to have trie intercollegiate

matches held on the campus
grounds. Last year for the first
time the intercollegiate track and
field meet was held on the Berke
ley campus and proved a decided
success, while in all other respects
the meet was much more satisfac
tory than were those previously
held on the grounds in the city.
Next spring this field meet should
be held on our own campus, and,
although there will be considerable
expense in fitting up the grounds
for the contest, this should not be
spared in view of the general good
which would result. This is a mat
ter which may come before the in
tercollegiate athletic committees in
their joint meeting next month; and
should it receive their approval, ar
rangements should then be made by
those in charge of the intercolleg
iate debate to have the debate this
year held at {Stanford. With the
accommodations of the new Assem
bly Hall, we could be prepared for
all who desired to attend the de
bate, and the result would be much
more satisfactory than the debates
which are now held in San Fran
cisco, where the students who are
interested in hearing the contest
are crowded out by the people from
the city. If such a custom were
started next spring, it would be es
pecially appropriate, since the next
Carnot debate is held in Berkeley,
and by bringing the Intercollegiate
to Stanford each university would
have one of these contests on its
own campus each year. As this is
a change which must be made some
time, why not make it now?
