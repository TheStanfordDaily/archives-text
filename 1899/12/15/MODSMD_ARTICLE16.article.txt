With this issue the Daily Palo
Alto suspends publication for the
semester, and the work of the mem
bers of the staff is. for the present,
ended. The editor-in-chief takes
it upon himself to thank them for
the assistance rendered during the
semester. Although we have in
sisted upon the most careful work,
and have, perhaps, been too exact
ing at times, it was done merely to
keep up the standard of the paper,
and not from a lack of apprecia
tion. And now, as a parting ap
peal, we respectfully urge upon the
faculty committee that the work of
the paper be so arranged that $ome
University credit may be received
for it. The editor-in-chief spends six
hours a day on the paper, while the
associate and assistant editors each
work three hours one day in the
week. No one who has had the
experience will say that the work is
not worthy of University credit.
The constitution carefully provides
that the editor shall not receive
more than fifty dollars per month
salary. This was a very wise pro
vision, and ten years hence will
probably receive editorial criticism.
At present the editor turns his
monthly salary into room rent, and
usually finds himself short. We
feel, therefore, in view of the work
done, that some provision should
be made in the future whereby the
editor-in-chief at least may receive
some credit for his work.

Looking back over the past, we
have little to congratulate our
selves upon from a newspaper
standpoint. The paper was started
seven and a half years ago, and
has continued without change of
size or form, and with little im
provement in material and style.
The reason for this is that a new
editor comes in each semester, and
by the time his term is ended he
has just about enough experience
to enable him to begin. But no
editor can devote more than one
semester to the paper, and some
plan should therefore be adopted
whereby the men are trained up to
the editorship. For this purpose
we would suggest that after the
staff has been chosen by the editor
the members meet and elect two
persons from their number as man
aging editors, who will divide the
day equally between them. Then
let these two be the only candidates
for the editorship at the end of
their term. With such a provision
we feel sure that the standard of
the paper will be greatly increased
over that of the present.
