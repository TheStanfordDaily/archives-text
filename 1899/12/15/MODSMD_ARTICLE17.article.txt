# Memorial Windows.
## 
### 
The three memorial windows
which have been placed in the Li
brary are the work of Joseph Lamb
of New York. The windows are
alike in size and shape, but of dif
ferent design. On the left is
Thomas h Kem is, on the right
Moses, and in the center, Raphael's
Christ. The small pieces of glass
forming each window are all hand
painted, and each piece is a study
in light effect.
The center window, that of
Christ, is Lamb's masterpiece. The
face is illuminated by the sun, and
a halo of light surrounds the head.
The windows on the left and right,
those of Thomas h. Kempis and
Moses, are in more subdued colors,
and set off to good advantage the
central figure of Christ.
