# BURNETT THE CAPTAIN.
## The 						Popular Tackle Chosen to Lead the Varsity Next Season. 
### 
At the meeting held in Encina
last Saturday night William Wes
ley Burnett was unanimously chosen
captain of the football team for the
season of 1900, to succeed Chester
G. Murphy.
"Babe" Burnett comes from
Adelaide, San Luis Obispo county,
and is 26 years old. His major is
Law. He" entered the University
with the present Class of 1900. He
played center on his freshman team,
which defeated Berkeley 14 to 4.
He was also sub-center to"Heff"
Williams the same year.
As president of his Sophomore
class he lead the sophomore cotillon.
In 1897 he played center on the fa
mous Varsity team that defeated
Berkeley 28 to 0, forming with
Carle and Fickert the well known
center trio. On this game he played
the position better than it has ever
been played on the Coast. His
fierce tackling behind the line, and
getting down on kicks with the
ends, were the strong features of
his play.
Last year he enlisted and 11 played
right guard in the Philippines," as
a mem her of the famous Utah Light
Artillery. He saw much hard fight
ing, as this battery was in more
scraps than any other battery at
Manila. Returning home at the
beginning of this semester, he had
not entirely recovered from the ef-.
fects of a tropical fever which he
had contracted in the islands. Nev
ertheless, he showed his old-time
dash, and played a star game at
right tackle against Captain Whip
ple of the Berkeley team. The
U. C. papers commented on his
excellent playing.
After the election, a game with
the Multnomah Club in Portland
on Christmas day was discussed.
All the members of the team were
in favor of going, but nothing was
definitely decided upon, as Multno
mah has not as yet answered Man
ager Berry's proposition for a game.
Then Captain Murphy, in behalf
of the football team, presented Dr.
W. H. Murphy with a dress-suit case,
Manager Fred Berry with a pipe,
and Coach Chamberlin a minia
ture football, on which was in
scribed, "To Burr Chamberlin,
from the Stanford Football Team,
1899."
On last Tuesday evening the stu
dents assembled in the Zeta Psi
house and presented Burr Cham
berlin with a beautiful loving cup,
bearing on one side the inscription,
"To Burr Chamberlin, from the
Students of Stanford University,"
and on the other Bide the blue and
white pennant of Vale and the car
dinal pennant of Stanford. These
were encircled with a wreath of
laurel branches.
To Captain Murphy was given a
loving cup, on which was engraved,
"To Captain Chester G. Murphy,
from the members of Encina Club,"
and also a large enameled block
"S."
Late this afternoon Manager
Berry received word from the Mult
nomah Club and a game was ar
ranged for Christmas day. The
men will leave the University Sat
urday for Portland. Fifteen men
will be taken on the trip.
