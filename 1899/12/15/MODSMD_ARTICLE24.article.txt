# WOMEN'S ATHLETICS.
## Faculty Committee Rules Against Any Intercollegiate Contests. 
### 
The Faculty Athletic Committee
has just announced its ruling in
reference to women's athletics.
Hereafter no intercollegiate contest
requiring team work of any kind
will be permitted, and any contest
in which the women engage must
take place on the home grounds.
The committee strongly favors all
kinds of athletics for women pro
vided they are of an individual
character. Tennis, track and field
events, and handball are to be en
couraged, and basket-ball games
between classes.
This ruling of the Faculty places
women's athletics here on the same
basis as they are in the Eastern
colleges. There the question of
health has been studied carefully
and any contests of any kind be
tween colleges have been prohibited
for the good of the students'
health.
To encourage tennis and tennis
tournaments, a trophy is to be of
fered, which will be competed for
this spring.
Interclass basket-ball games will
probably take place this spring,
and as an incentive to such con
tests there is a class trophy, which
was presented to the Class of '98
when it was won from the '99 team,
and which has not been competed
for since.
Interest in other forms of ath
letics promises to be greater than
usual this year. The following are
the committees of the Women's
Athletic Association who have
charge of the various events: Ten
nis —Miss Meredith, Miss Hell,
Miss Short (chairman); Track—
Miss March, Miss Mary Gilman,
Miss Dale (chairman); Pedestrian
and Bicycle—Miss Swett, Miss
Richards, Mrs. T. A. Story (chair
man); Basket-ball— Miss March,
Miss Tucker, Mrs. Story; Miss
Yrene Pitcher is captain of the
team.
