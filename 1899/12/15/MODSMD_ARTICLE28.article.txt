urday night to represent Stanford
in the Sixth Annual Carnot Medal
Contest. Miss Anna G. Fraser, '00,
was chosen as alternate. In the
preliminary try-out there were six
contestants, divided into two separ
ate debutes. The subject of the
first debate was "Resolved, That
the French Cabinet Ministers
should be made responsible to the
President alone."
L. B. Wilson, '00, led for the
affirmative in a strong and con
vincing argument, contending that
the Chamber of Deputies was an
irresponsible body and should be
made responsible to the chief exec
utive.
J. F. English, '01, followed also
for the affirmative. He showed
that the French government suf
fered from a want of a definite pol
icy, and that the French Presi
dency was an undesirable position
on this account.
C. M. Marrack, '01, represented
the negative of the question. He
maintained that the American
system could not be successfully
applied to the French government,
but that the centralization of such
power in the President would re
sult in a dictatorship.
Each of the speakers were given
short rebuttal speeches in the order
of their regular speeches.
The second debate was on the
subject "Resolved, That the Cabi
net Ministers should be excluded
from seats in the French Assem
bly." Owing to the withdrawal
of one of the speakers, an arrange
ment was made by which the neg
ative led and closed the debate.
Charles Quayle, '00, opened the
debate for the negative. He con
tended that the Ministers are the
representatives of the nation and
that the Assembly should be given
the benefit of their experience.
Miss Anna G. Fraser, '00, fol
lowed for the affirmative. She
showed the great danger to France
of the one-man power, and argued
that France could not safely com
bine the executive and legislative
branches as the Ministers have the
power of influencing the Assembly
to grant their measures.
E. Springer, '00, closed for the
negative. He said that the Minis
ters might influence legislation
through their agents in the Assem
bly, but that this could be better
done by allowing the Ministers to
come in person before the Assem
bly. lie objected to the change
in the present system as weaken
ing the French government where
it is the weakest.
Each of the speakers then closed
with short speeches in rebuttal and
the judges retired for their decision,
which was as announced above.
The interest manifested in the
preliminaries this year has been
greater than usual and the men
chosen have the confidence of nil
those interested in debating in the
University. After the decision of
the judges Professor Duniway, who
was president of the evening,called
the three members of the team for
ward and presented to them the
Stanford debating pins which were
provided for them by the Executive
