# Stanford Men in New York.
## 
### 
In New York City a loyal band
of Stanfordites gathered for their
annual Thanksgiving "jolly-up"
at The Arena and awaited the
result of the game. Among the
number were some of the sturdiest
wearers of the " S " we ever had.
Some of the best known are "Jeff"
Wilson, Varsity end and captain
in 1893; Guy Cochran, Varsity
tackle for three years and fullback
and captain in 1895; " Heff"
Williams, Varsity center in 1895,
1896; A 1 Spalding, Varsity end,
1894, 1895; and Harry Reynolds,
sub-halfback in 1895 and one of
the best all-round track and field
men ever in college. They were

somewhat surprised at the score, —
but like all the local supporters,
adopted the slogan "On to 1900 !"
