# PROPOSED AGREEMENT.
## The 						New Athletic Regulations, With Arguments For and Against. 
### 
It is generally known that the
two faculty athletic committees
passed certain regulations for gov
erning intercollegiate athletics at a
meeting held in San Francisco on
November 25th, but just what was
done has been largely a matter of
speculation. These regulations are
now under discussion at Berke
ley ; they may be finally adopted

or amended, partially accepted, or
totally rejected.
The regulations are therefore
here given, as they now stand be
fore the committee for final action.
The editor of The Daily Palo
Alto has very kindly placed at my
disposal "unlimited space" in which
I can explain the position of the
committees. While 1 cannot claim
to speak for the committees, I have
availed myself of his kind offer to
give my own personal view at some
length.
Regulations Concerning Intercol
legiate Athletics.
Unanimously adopted at a meeting
of the Faculty Athletic Committees
of the University of California and
the Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, San Francisco, Cal., Nov. 25,
1899.
I. Shortening the Football Sea
son. —The intercollegiate football
game shall be played on or before
the second Saturday in November.
11. Concerning the Football
Ccach. — (1) In the future the reg
ular coach or coaches for the foot
ball teams shall be graduates of
the university at which they are
coaching. They shall receive no
salary, but may have all their ex
penses paid.
(2) It is not desired, however, to
prevent the acceptance of assistance
and advice freely offered to the
regular coaches by any experi
enced player who may be at the
time living in California; and such
person may be allowed traveling
expenses to and from his home
within the State, and may have
his expenses paid while actually
assisting with the coaching, lie
shall, however, receive no other
compensation, nor shall he be
made any allowance for traveling
expenses outside the State of Cali
fornia.
111. Concerning Exchange of
Lists of Eligible Contestants. —The
managers shall submit the names
of their candidates for all intercol
legiate athletic contests, each to the
chairman of his own faculty com

mittee on athletics. The names on
this list that are eligible according
to the intercollegiate agreement
shall then be certified by the chair
man of the committee, and at least
three weeks before the game or con
test transmitted to the chairman of
the faculty committee at tbe other
university, and by him transmitted
to his manager.
The only objection to men whose
names are on this list that will be
entertained will be in regard to
their amateur standing. *

In case such objection is made,
the manager objecting must make
his objections in writing within one
week after receiving the names,
stating when and where amateur
standing lias been forfeited, and
give this to the chairman of his
own faculty committee, to be by
him transmitted to the other com
mittee for investigation and final
settlement.
IV. Concerning the Eligibility
of Players.— (1) No person who is
drawing a salary from the Univer
sity shall be eligible. (This is in
tended to prevent the playing of
student assistants, whether they be
assistants in the gymnasium, in the
laboratory, or in the class-room.)
(2) No person who occupies any
position or office within the gift of
the student body, to which there is
a regular fixed salary attached, can
be eligible for intercollegiate con
tests.
Note. —At present Section (2)
shall be construed to mean only
the treasurer of the student body.
In favor of Regulation 1 it may
be said that there is a very strong
desire among many people inter
ested in both football and Thanks
giving that they should not be
called upon to choose between the
football giitne and the more tradi
tional method of spending the day.
They would like to have both the
game and their Thanksgiving.
Then, too, as it now stands with
football lasting from early Septem
ber until late November, the season
is too long. There is no doubt
whatever but that team play and
condition for the big game could be
developed more rapidly than it has
been were there the need for doing
so.
The long season is too great a de
mand to make upon the players.
For those of us who stop once or
twice a week to watch the practice
the season is not too long; we could
do this tbe year round. A person
who has never donned a football
suit and gone into vigorous train
ing for a big game can not realize

the amount of hard labor and self
denial it requires of the players.
For their sakes alone it seems to
me it would be well to shorten the
season.
Then, too, something might be
said in favor of having a little
longer time between the final game
and the Christmas examinations,
but 1 shall not enlarge upon this
point.
The main objection against the
change is the loss of the Thanks
giving audience, it being assumed
that on no other day would so large
a crowd attend the game. A very
large per cent, of those who can af
ford to pay from $1.50 to $5.00 for
a seat can also spare a Saturday
afternoon. There would be some
gain from those who now obstinate
ly refuse to give up their Thanks
giving at home. It is well known
that rain or shine, thaw or freeze,
live or die, nothing will prevent
the real football enthusiast from
attending the game. In the East
there has been no loss of numbers
by giving up Thanksgiving games.
It is in regard to Regulation II
that there is the most general dif
ference of opinion, and certainly a
great deal can be said on both
sides. Unfortunately it is a ques
tion that no amount of argument
can settle, —nothing but experience
will settle the question. The com
mittee makes no claim of infalli
bility for its opinions, but it feels
strongly that the experiment is
worth trying.
It is much harder for us to take
the initial step than it would be
had we not had with us men like
Mr. Camp and Mr. Chamberlin, who
have aroused in us a love and en
thusiasm for their personal qualities
as well as an admiration for their
skill as coaches.
If we are to get the most out of
football that there is in it for us,
we must develop a system of gradu
ate coaches. We now have quite a
large number of graduates who
know the game as well as it is pos
sible to learn it under present con
ditions. They have had four years'
experience under the best Eastern
coaches. The continuation of our
present system will only increase
the number of graduates with this
experience; none of them will be
come any better prepared to meet
the responsibility of being chief
coaches than they are now. This
change would very much increase
the responsibilities of the captain
and of the players themselves.
But this would be good; —responsi-
bility develops people.
Graduate coaches, captains, and
players would have a new incen
tive for understanding the game,
for watching its development in the
East, for improving old plays, for
thinking out new plays; in other
words, we ourselves could develop
the game. To say that we could
not, is to say that our students are
on the average mentally inferior to
the students of Princeton, or Yale,
which is not true.
The immediate result of this ac
tion would be an inferior variety of
football from that seen in the re
cent games. The ultimate result,
I fully believe, would be a superior
variety of football. For with grad
uate coaches we would have the
services of many coaches instead of
one. Ho long, however, as both un
iversities were working under like
conditions this inferiority would be
apparent only te> the eye of the ex
pert.
It, is hardly possible that college
football on the Pacific Coast will in
the near future be equal to that of
the East. This is not because we
do not have the material, but be

cause we have not the machinery
for developing it. We do not have
enough different teams to play
against. In this connection it would
be well for our football authorities
to encourage the formation of teams
at as many different schools as pos
sible. The University of the Pa
cific, Santa Clara College, the Nor
mal schools, each might well fur
nish one team one or two practice
games a year. The game with the
University of Nevada this year was
a step in the right direction. In
this connection a little history may
prove interesting. The first year
the University opened there were
many things to be done, and foot
ball was taken up late, so that the
first intercollegiate game was not
played until March, 1892. To start
with, there were only a few men
who knew the game, and a man
who had seen a Harvard-Yale or a
Yale-Princeton game was an oracle
indeed. Nevertheless every one
went in with vim to see what could
be done, and every one that knew
anything about the game was
pressed into service to tell what he
knew. Many studied the game,
many made suggestions most fool
ish, and worthless, of course. The
general interest in the season of
preparation was intense, and the
final game was as interesting from
the spectator's point of view as any
game that has yet been played.
The next autumn Mr. Cham plain,
the manager,'consulted the Faculty
Athletic Committee as to the advis
ability of getting an expert from
the East to give us the fine points
of the game. When it was learned
that we could get Mr. Camp, the
very source of all football knowl
edge, the faculty committee gave its
consent to the step. With Mr.
Camp our instruction in football
and sportsmanship progressed rap
idly, and the game played the next
year showed clearly the hand of an
expert.
But with Mr. Camp to depend
upon, there was no need for advice
and suggestions from others, so that
the general interest became more
passive, the keen desire of everyone
to help was lost.
The next year Mr. Bliss came,
and the year following Mr. Camp
again. At the close of Mr. Camp's
second season with us Mr. Cochran
was elected captair. In the mean
time the Faculty Athletic Commit
tee thought it would be well to do
without the Eastern coach, but we
did not want to take the matter
into our own hands, but rather
thought to encourage the students
to agree to give up the Eastern
coach at both universities. With
this in view Mr. Cochran was in
vited to meet the committee and
talk the matter over.
Mr. Cochran thought it would be
well to do away with the services of
an Eastern coach, but that perhaps
it would be well to have one for an
other year, especially as we could
again have Mr. Camp, but that one
more year with an Eastern coach
would put us in a position to de
velop the game ourselves.
Since that timo «ach captain and
each manager ban wanted one more
year.
The real difficulty, of course, is
that,although thecaptain and man
ager may appreciate the value of a
well developed system of graduate
coaches for the future, they feel
that their game must be won t and
they do not look with favor upon
any experiment being tried upon
them. Our students feel that in
some way Berkeley would get the
advantage in the change. Berke
ley students are even more sure
that Stanford would have the ad

vantage. But in fact both univer
sities would be in the same condi
tion, and how either one would gain
any material advantage over the
other by the change 1 cannot see.
At any rate, it would be Stanford
vs. Berkeley, and not Stanford and
Yale or Stanford and Pennsylvania
against Berkeley and Yale or Berke
ley and Princeton.
This year Berkeley has two East
ern coaches, and as two Eastern
coaches are better than one, future
Berkeley managers will not see
their way clear to getting along
with less than two. But if. Berke
ley has two we shall send two also,
and perhaps three.
Thus expenses mount up until
the manager and treasurer are put
to it to make both ends meet.
Everything else must be subordi
nated to getting a big gate receipt;
prices for seats each year go a little
higher, until many of the students
of limited means cannot afford the
luxury of the game.
A severe storm on the day of the
game, in spite of the large advance
sales, is liable to make bankrupts
of both student bodies. The possi
bility of having our games on the
university grounds where they
really belong, where those most in
terested would get the best chance
to see them, and where there is the
most genuine pleasure for all con
cerned, is rendered remote by the
necessity of making a large amount
of money out of every game.
In regard to the matter of sal
ary for the graduate coaches, it is
a self-evident proposition that our
university athletics should not be
used as a money-making scheme
for any graduate or under-gradu
ate. It would, however, be asking
too much of any of our alumni to
undergo any financial sacrifice in
order to help us out, and it is there
fore perfectly justifiable that all of
their expenses should be paid.
Stanford has as loyal a body of
alumni as any institution in the
country, and to assume that they
would not do what alumni else
where will do is unfair to them.
Our alumni knowing that we were
dependent upon them would make
every effort to help us out. They
could i lan their work ahead so as
to have a vacation of a week, or
two weeks, or three weeks, or four
weeks, and spend it with us just
before the big game.
Finally, both faculty committees
are unanimously in favor of having
the games on the university grounds,
but inasmuch as with their new
plans at Berkeley it is not yet
known where their permanent ath
letic field is to be or how soon it
can be gotten ready, it was decided
to say nothing about that point at
present. (t. M. Richardson.
Charles R. Lewers, one of the as
sistant coaches, said in regard to
the propositions of the committee:
I am in favor of changing the
date of the final game in order to
make the season shorter. It seems
to me, however, that it should not
be earlier than the second week in
November. As it is now, our sea
son is too long, but if it is to be
shortened much, I should like to
see the first part of it cut off, if that
is possible. This year we were for
tunate in having good weather
from the first, but past experience
has shown that we can not expect
that to be the case very often. If
the early fall is dry and hot, no
football worthy of the effort used
can be developed, no matter bow
willing the candidates and coaches.
Stanford has always done her best
work, in fact her only real work, af
ter the first of October. Why not
begin practice, then, near the end
of September and have the final
game the Saturday before Thanks
giving?
There is one other point, how
ever, in connection with the length
of the season which must not be
overlooked. We can not make our
season as short as that of Harvard
or Yale, for we have to teach the
rudiments of the game to most of
the candidates, while their teams
are generally made up of men who
have had extensive experience on
preparatory school teams.
I do not think we are in a posi
tion to cut ourselves lose from East
ern football methods. Such would
be the inevitable result of confining
ourselves to graduate coaches. If
we were near enough to those col
leges where the best football is
played to engage in games with
them our men could keep fully in
touch with the best development of
the game. But that is not possible
now, and if we are to keep up with
the game we must either send our
graduates East to learn the game
or bring Eastern men here to teach
us.
But if we are to develop graduate
coaches, it seems better to develop
them by having them act as advis
ers, or rather assistants, under some
man who thoroughly understands
the game,— such a man, for in
stance, as Chamberlin. The sug
gestions of former players were al
ways received by him with respect,
and either adapted or rejected after
discussion or trial. But to these
ideas of our own graduates, which
generally can be only the result of
their own limited experience, we
should add the knowledge of a man
who has learned the game in a
harder and more varied school.
J. E. Reynolds, assistant coach
this season, expressed himself in
favor of shortening the training
season, but said it would be better
to take the time off the other end.
"The season is too long," he said.
" 1 think the men themselves feel
that football takes too much of
their time, but do not like to admit
it. If we could begin later in the
season, and have the cold weather
of October and November for train
ing, I would be in favor of the
change.
" I do not believe we are ready to
do away with Eastern coaches. Our
own men do not see enough football
played to enable them to do good
coaching.
" I am heartily in favor of cam
pus games, and think that as soon
as the grounds can be prepared we
should hold all of our games on
the college campus."
Captain Burnett favored the
shortening of the season, and said
that as soon as the graduates were
able to take charge of the coaching
it should be putin their hands, as
they would better undeihland the
play of their opponents, and would
take a deeper interest in the success
of the team.
