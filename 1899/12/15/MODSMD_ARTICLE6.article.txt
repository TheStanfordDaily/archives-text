# PROPOSED AGREEMENT.
## The
						New Athletic Regulations, With Arguments For and Against. 
### 
It is generally known that the
two faculty athletic committees
passed certain regulations for gov
erning intercollegiate athletics at a
meeting held in San Francisco on
November 25th, but just what was
done has been largely a matter of
speculation. These regulations are
now under discussion at Berke
ley ; they may be finally adopted

or amended, partially accepted, or
totally rejected.
The regulations are therefore
here given, as they now stand be
fore the committee for final action.
The editor of The Daily Palo
Alto has very kindly placed at my
disposal "unlimited space" in which
I can explain the position of the
committees. While 1 cannot claim
to speak for the committees, I have
availed myself of his kind offer to
give my own personal view at some
length.
Regulations Concerning Intercol
legiate Athletics.
Unanimously adopted at a meeting
of the Faculty Athletic Committees
of the University of California and
the Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, San Francisco, Cal., Nov. 25,
1899.
I. Shortening the Football Sea
son. —The intercollegiate football
game shall be played on or before
the second Saturday in November.
11. Concerning the Football
Ccach. — (1) In the future the reg
ular coach or coaches for the foot
ball teams shall be graduates of
the university at which they are
coaching. They shall receive no
salary, but may have all their ex
penses paid.
(2) It is not desired, however, to
prevent the acceptance of assistance
and advice freely offered to the
regular coaches by any experi
enced player who may be at the
time living in California; and such
person may be allowed traveling
expenses to and from his home
within the State, and may have
his expenses paid while actually
assisting with the coaching, lie
shall, however, receive no other
compensation, nor shall he be
made any allowance for traveling
expenses outside the State of Cali
fornia.
111. Concerning Exchange of
Lists of Eligible Contestants. —The
managers shall submit the names
of their candidates for all intercol
legiate athletic contests, each to the
chairman of his own faculty com

mittee on athletics. The names on
this list that are eligible according
to the intercollegiate agreement
shall then be certified by the chair
man of the committee, and at least
three weeks before the game or con
test transmitted to the chairman of
the faculty committee at tbe other
university, and by him transmitted
to his manager.
The only objection to men whose
names are on this list that will be
entertained will be in regard to
their amateur standing. *

In case such objection is made,
the manager objecting must make
his objections in writing within one
week after receiving the names,
stating when and where amateur
standing lias been forfeited, and
give this to the chairman of his
own faculty committee, to be by
him transmitted to the other com
mittee for investigation and final
settlement.
IV. Concerning the Eligibility
of Players.— (1) No person who is
drawing a salary from the Univer
sity shall be eligible. (This is in
tended to prevent the playing of
student assistants, whether they be
assistants in the gymnasium, in the
laboratory, or in the class-room.)
(2) No person who occupies any
position or office within the gift of
the student body, to which there is
a regular fixed salary attached, can
be eligible for intercollegiate con
tests.
Note. —At present Section (2)
shall be construed to mean only
the treasurer of the student body.
In favor of Regulation 1 it may
be said that there is a very strong
desire among many people inter
ested in both football and Thanks
giving that they should not be
called upon to choose between the
football giitne and the more tradi
tional method of spending the day.
They would like to have both the
game and their Thanksgiving.
Then, too, as it now stands with
football lasting from early Septem
ber until late November, the season
is too long. There is no doubt
whatever but that team play and
condition for the big game could be
developed more rapidly than it has
been were there the need for doing
so.
The long season is too great a de
mand to make upon the players.
For those of us who stop once or
twice a week to watch the practice
the season is not too long; we could
do this tbe year round. A person
who has never donned a football
suit and gone into vigorous train
ing for a big game can not realize
