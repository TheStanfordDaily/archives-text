# THOMAS WELTON STANFORD LIBRARY.
## Stanford's New Repository for Books Formally Added to the University Buildings. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon, by appro
priate exercises, the Thomas Wel
ton Stanford Library was formally
dedicated, and the longed-for home
for our books turned over to the
uses for which it was intended.
Trustees, faculty, alumni, students,
and friends gathered to celebrate
the occasion and event. President
Wheeler of California, with Librar
ian Rowell and students from
there, came over to show their in
terest and satisfaction in our new
possession, the former, on entering
the room, being greeted with hearty
applause. The Assembly Hall,
where the exercises were held, was
comfortably filled.
After an invocation by Rev. T.
F. Burnham of Vallejo, Librarian
H. C. Nash told, in a carefully pre
pared speech, something of the pro
gress of the Stanford Library since
the opening of the University in
1891. The first year, the speaker
said, " The librarian had to satisfy
the hunger of six hundred profes
sors and students on three thousand
volumes, but the next year saw ma
terial progress when five thousand
volumes were added and Mr. Tim
othy Hopkins presented us with
the Railway library, the most com
plete of its kind in the United
States." And continuing, later in
the address, " When we move into
our new quarters next week we shall
take with us forty-five thousand
books especially selected by the
heads of the different departments
of the University, with the single
purpose of always obtaining the
best authority on each particular
subject. The Library has grown in
a steady, healthy manner in all its
departments, and it has not only
not stopped growing at this time,
but it is shooting up so rapidly
that, as the Kansas man said of
the corn in his State, 'You can
it growing.'"
In closing, Mr. Nash said: "And
some of us who work for libraries
in this State have other and broader
hopes for the future. We have had
various visions of a practical con
solidation of the large libraries of
California, whether University,
State, or city, and especially of a
closer union of the libraries of the
two universities, with a view to the
greatest advantage to the largest
number of students, whether they
hail from Berkeley or Palo Alto.
"If, in moving to our new build
ing, we can say in truth, 'Old
things have passed away; behold,
all things are become new,' still
there is one thing I trust will never
pass away—Stanford's feeling of
glorious gratitude to those who
have made both the old and the
new possible."
Dr. Cleorge E. Howard, head of
the History department, was then
introduced by President Jordan as
the speaker of the day. He said in
part:
"To realize the full significance
of the library as a culture factor,
three propositions may be consid

ered: (1) Our generation has wit
nessed the birth of a new science
and a new profession ; (2) as an
educational institution, the open
library is a necessity of social evo
lution ; (3) the open library is des
tined to become the. safeguard of
triumphant democracy."
After sketching under the first
two heads the wonderful growth of
the library in this and other coun
tries, both as a scientific develop
ment and as a primal factor in
social progress, Dr. Howard spoke
of the library as the safeguard of
American democracy.
"It requires no argument," he
said, "to show that a full mind is
a good preparation for citizenship.
The undisciplined conscience is al
ways a treacherous guide. But
what is the precise quality of the
informing influence imparted by
the systematic reading of good
books? That is the point which it
will pay us somewhat more exactly
to consider.
" For more than half a century
after its origin our republic was
looked upon with curiosity or su
percilious toleration by most for
eign observers as decidedly a most
hazardous experiment. It seemed
a strange thing that there should
be a vast and rapidly expanding
nation in which exists no govern
ing class, no group of men whose
hereditary function it is to special
ize in administration and statecraft.
On the contrary, in the newborn
democracy the plain people were
expected to take upon themselves
the duties and privileges incident
to self-rule. Each voter was re
quired to be a specialist in the high
functions of social self-help.
" It is perhaps not surprising
that men steeped in the traditions
of monarchy and aristocracy should
have predicted, first, anarchy and
then, speedy dissolution. One trav
eler, indeed, there was, possessing
more ability than all the others
put together, who thought quite
differently. Some sixty years ago
De Tocqueville, the only serious for
eign student of our institutions be
fore Bryce wrote his Commonwealth,
gave expression to his faith in the
perpetuity of American democracy.
He perceived a conservative ele
ment in our society which he be
lieved would be our safeguard
against the rashness and fickleness
and passion of popular judgment.
This conservative element he found
in our lawyers, who, he saw, were
our leaders in local and national
politics. On the whole the opinion
of De Tocqueville has thus far been
justified by experience. The Amer
ican bar, with its well-known rev
erence for established institutions,
has been a powerful conservative
force in the nation. In the older
commonwealths, and in the Federal
Congress, at any rate, it is largely
due to the lawyer that our political
mistakes have not been more disas
trous.
" But a new crisis has at length

arisen. We now stand face to face
with conditions which demand a
conservative force with a much
broader foundation than can be
supplied by any one class or pro
fession, however numerous, wise, or
powerful. Once again, there are
many who seem to think that the
fears of those early observers may
after all be justified. Political cor
ruption, economic ignorance, and
industrial greed are having the
natural consequences. For our vast
and complex population, the bread
and-butter problem is getting harder
and harder. Withal the lawyers
are themselves on trial. Legal
ism and the shameful miscarriage
of justice through the tortuous
trickery of judicial process are
breeding suspicion and hatred. A
great political party has voiced the
sentiment of millions that even the
Federal courts, however uncon
sciously, have drifted in the nat
ural course of precedent into a
practical alliance with the alleged
plutocratic enemy of organized la
bor. Instead of being received as
a protector, legal conservatism is
now harshly arraigned as a social
enemy. Indeed the pessimist who
despairs of the Republic is abroad
in the land.
" Yet how little does the pessim
ist appreciate the capacity of Amer
ican society for self-protection.
There is of a truth, crying need of
a conservative force whose founda
tion shall be as broad as the basis
of citizenship. That forCe must be
supplied by a popular education
whose latest differentiated organ
and whose very symbol is the open
library. In one sense, it must be
confessed, there is more truth in
Pope's epigram that 'a little learn
ing is a dangerous thing' than the
poet ever dreamed of. Especially
is this so when the little learning is
all on one side of a serious ques
tion; though in that event much
learning of the same lop-sided sort
would be a good deal more perilous.
It is just here that the exclusive
feeding upon the partisan news
paper has threatened to become a
national calamity. The hired lies
and cynical half-truths of the typ
ical party ' organ' are a deadly
poison, which would surely corrupt
the heart and paralyze the brain of
the social body were a proper anti
dote not forthcoming. Here is the
real source of the anarchy and in
humanism which endanger Amer
ican democracy. The antidote or
preventive is the earnest reading of
honest books; books on both sides of
social questions, produced by
trained minds inspired with a desire
to tell the whole truth. A man who
knows the best that has been
thought and felt on both sides is
pretty effectually spoiled for be
coming a fanatic or an anarchist.
One who has sincerely weighed his
adversary's case in a religious con
troversy is not so ready to shout
" crucify him " or to provide him
with a bonfire. The citizen who
has mastered the literature of
money and exchange is not likely
to call his neighbor a fool or believe
him a knave because, proceeding
from the same sources of informa
tion, he has forsooth reached a dif
ferent conclusion. The student who
knowß the industrial history of the

English race, with its amazing
vicissitudes, will not be hasty in
denying honor or common human
ity to the leader of a demoralizing
strike, or to the head of a gigantic
trust. Nor will one who has read
the full and impartial history of
our country be eager to ily at the
throat of his southern brother be
cause the latter may be violent,
even cruel, in his manner of deal
ing with the mighty social burden
which two centuries and a half of
national sinning have laid upon
him. In a word, the open library
is the inexhaustible fountain of
that conservative humanism which
will prove the safeguard of tri
umphant democracy."
President Jordan introduced
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler,
of Berkeley, " because," he said,
"nothing of one University is suc
cessful without the support of the
other." President Wheeler spoke
feelingly and earnestly, saying,
among other things:
" The old story of the upward
struggle of man towards civilization
has been the story of a struggle
against the barriers which time and
space have set, and in this struggle
man is increasing his strength.
When'he has brought together out
of the spaces what is scattered
lavishly there in the chaos of things
and set them in order he has created
for himself power and control.
What else, indeed, is wealth, except
that things scattered abroad in the
chaos have been brought together?
Man rises out of his slavery to a
triumph over space.
" What is the university for, ex
cept to liberate men, to liberate
men from this slavery and from the
phantom dread of the present, and
teach them that to live they should
live as part of a great whole that
reaches out into the past and shall
be completed only in the future.
"In the University no institu
tion is more the institution of the
university than the library. It
stands to teach men that lives now
being lived in the present are not
being read aright unless they are
read in the succession of events, ex
cept they are made a part of the
data of science collected out of
space.
"People of Stanford, I bring you
greeting from the people df Berke
ley. We rejoice with you in the
house you have builded, in the
goodly store of human experience
that you are gathering into books
you are storing upon your shelves.
We shall rejoice in the growing
strength and in eveiy book that is
added to it, for every book that is
added to the Library of Stanford
University becomes a common [toe
session of all who look for larger
and better things in this State."
Dr. Horatio Stebbins, represent
ing, as President Jordan said, the
Board of Trustees, himself, and all
other good people, said in part:
"We are here today to celebrate
the opening of the Library, the gift
of one of the kinsmen of the found
ers. \Y r hat is a library? what is it
for? how do you use it? A library,
as 1 understand it, is a spot on this
earth where the records of mankind
are brought together, where the
thought, the histories, the actions,
the imaginations of the race are
brought to a focus. There dwell
the spirits of the mighty dead.
They walk to and fro in the mid
night hours, the ghosts that govern
the world. The library is the re
pository of all that has been
thought, said, done, or heard by.
human kind.
"How shall we use a library?
That is a profounder question than
admits of discussion here, and 1 am
not here to give guidance to any
body or to any body of men. How
to use a library? I speak now, as
1 may, to this fair concourse of
young women and young men.
How to use a library depends on
your view of education itself,
whether an education is for train
ing the mind or for stocking the
mind, whether you are here as a
student or as a general reader, and
whether you can distinguish in
your minds the difference between
study and reading. If there is a
tedious man on earth to me it is
what is commonly called a 1 well
informed ' man. What we want is
power of thought. My friends, in
tellectual honesty is much more
rare than moral honesty. There
are more men who intend to be
honest than there are that can
think consecutively and know what
they are about.
" And now to the students of the
University, a word. I am not
preaching to you, my young friends,
but I have one word to say to you.
Distinguish first of all in the use of
a library the difference between
reading and studying. They are
distinct things. One is the use of
the library as an aid to your
studies; the other is to use your
library for that general intelligence,
that inspiration and information
that go to make up a cheerful man,
a warm heart, and an inspiring
spirit. For this end, stick to your
studies. l)o not be diverted by
general reading, wandering about
through millions of acres of general
reading, millions of acres that a
bullock couldn't get his living off.
"Literature — what is it? what
do you mean by it? In the large
sense it is that golden chain which,
fastened to the earth and reaching
to heaven, keeps up the human race
from barbarism, and leads them on
to the final destiny that God has
appointed."

President Jordan introduced
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler,
of Berkeley, " because," he said,
"nothing of one University is suc
cessful without the support of the
other." President Wheeler spoke
feelingly and earnestly, saying,
among other things:
" The old story of the upward
struggle of man towards civilization
has been the story of a struggle
against the barriers which time and
space have set, and in this struggle
man is increasing his strength.
When'he has brought together out
of the spaces what is scattered
lavishly there in the chaos of things
and set them in order he has created
for himself power and control.
What else, indeed, is wealth, except
that things scattered abroad in the
chaos have been brought together?
Man rises out of his slavery to a
triumph over space.
" What is the university for, ex
cept to liberate men, to liberate
men from this slavery and from the
phantom dread of the present, and
teach them that to live they should
live as part of a great whole that
reaches out into the past and shall
be completed only in the future.
"In the University no institu
tion is more the institution of the
university than the library. It
stands to teach men that lives now
being lived in the present are not
being read aright unless they are
read in the succession of events, ex
cept they are made a part of the
data of science collected out of
space.
"People of Stanford, I bring you
greeting from the people df Berke
ley. We rejoice with you in the
house you have builded, in the
goodly store of human experience
that you are gathering into books
you are storing upon your shelves.
We shall rejoice in the growing
strength and in eveiy book that is
added to it, for every book that is
added to the Library of Stanford
University becomes a common [toe
session of all who look for larger
and better things in this State."
Dr. Horatio Stebbins, represent
ing, as President Jordan said, the
Board of Trustees, himself, and all
other good people, said in part:
"We are here today to celebrate
the opening of the Library, the gift
of one of the kinsmen of the found
ers. \Y r hat is a library? what is it
for? how do you use it? A library,
as 1 understand it, is a spot on this
earth where the records of mankind
are brought together, where the
thought, the histories, the actions,
the imaginations of the race are
brought to a focus. There dwell
the spirits of the mighty dead.
They walk to and fro in the mid
night hours, the ghosts that govern
the world. The library is the re
pository of all that has been
thought, said, done, or heard by.
human kind.
"How shall we use a library?
That is a profounder question than
admits of discussion here, and 1 am
not here to give guidance to any
body or to any body of men. How
to use a library? I speak now, as
1 may, to this fair concourse of
young women and young men.
How to use a library depends on
your view of education itself,
whether an education is for train
ing the mind or for stocking the
mind, whether you are here as a
student or as a general reader, and
whether you can distinguish in
your minds the difference between
study and reading. If there is a
tedious man on earth to me it is
what is commonly called a 1 well
informed ' man. What we want is
power of thought. My friends, in
tellectual honesty is much more
rare than moral honesty. There
are more men who intend to be
honest than there are that can
think consecutively and know what
they are about.
" And now to the students of the
University, a word. I am not
preaching to you, my young friends,
but I have one word to say to you.
Distinguish first of all in the use of
a library the difference between
reading and studying. They are
distinct things. One is the use of
the library as an aid to your
studies; the other is to use your
library for that general intelligence,
that inspiration and information
that go to make up a cheerful man,
a warm heart, and an inspiring
spirit. For this end, stick to your
studies. l)o not be diverted by
general reading, wandering about
through millions of acres of general
reading, millions of acres that a
bullock couldn't get his living off.
"Literature — what is it? what
do you mean by it? In the large
sense it is that golden chain which,
fastened to the earth and reaching
to heaven, keeps up the human race
from barbarism, and leads them on
to the final destiny that God has
appointed."
Yesterday afternoon, by appro
priate exercises, the Thomas Wel
ton Stanford Library was formally
dedicated, and the longed-for home
for our books turned over to the
uses for which it was intended.
Trustees, faculty, alumni, students,
and friends gathered to celebrate
the occasion and event. President
Wheeler of California, with Librar
ian Rowell and students from
there, came over to show their in
terest and satisfaction in our new
possession, the former, on entering
the room, being greeted with hearty
applause. The Assembly Hall,
where the exercises were held, was
comfortably filled.
After an invocation by Rev. T.
F. Burnham of Vallejo, Librarian
H. C. Nash told, in a carefully pre
pared speech, something of the pro
gress of the Stanford Library since
the opening of the University in
1891. The first year, the speaker
said, " The librarian had to satisfy
the hunger of six hundred profes
sors and students on three thousand
volumes, but the next year saw ma
terial progress when five thousand
volumes were added and Mr. Tim
othy Hopkins presented us with
the Railway library, the most com
plete of its kind in the United
States." And continuing, later in
the address, " When we move into
our new quarters next week we shall
take with us forty-five thousand
books especially selected by the
heads of the different departments
of the University, with the single
purpose of always obtaining the
best authority on each particular
subject. The Library has grown in
a steady, healthy manner in all its
departments, and it has not only
not stopped growing at this time,
but it is shooting up so rapidly
that, as the Kansas man said of
the corn in his State, 'You can
it growing.'"
In closing, Mr. Nash said: "And
some of us who work for libraries
in this State have other and broader
hopes for the future. We have had
various visions of a practical con
solidation of the large libraries of
California, whether University,
State, or city, and especially of a
closer union of the libraries of the
two universities, with a view to the
greatest advantage to the largest
number of students, whether they
hail from Berkeley or Palo Alto.
"If, in moving to our new build
ing, we can say in truth, 'Old
things have passed away; behold,
all things are become new,' still
there is one thing I trust will never
pass away—Stanford's feeling of
glorious gratitude to those who
have made both the old and the
new possible."
Dr. Cleorge E. Howard, head of
the History department, was then
introduced by President Jordan as
the speaker of the day. He said in
part:
"To realize the full significance
of the library as a culture factor,
three propositions may be consid

ered: (1) Our generation has wit
nessed the birth of a new science
and a new profession ; (2) as an
educational institution, the open
library is a necessity of social evo
lution ; (3) the open library is des
tined to become the. safeguard of
triumphant democracy."
After sketching under the first
two heads the wonderful growth of
the library in this and other coun
tries, both as a scientific develop
ment and as a primal factor in
social progress, Dr. Howard spoke
of the library as the safeguard of
American democracy.
"It requires no argument," he
said, "to show that a full mind is
a good preparation for citizenship.
The undisciplined conscience is al
ways a treacherous guide. But
what is the precise quality of the
informing influence imparted by
the systematic reading of good
books? That is the point which it
will pay us somewhat more exactly
to consider.
" For more than half a century
after its origin our republic was
looked upon with curiosity or su
percilious toleration by most for
eign observers as decidedly a most
hazardous experiment. It seemed
a strange thing that there should

President Jordan introduced
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler,
of Berkeley, " because," he said,
"nothing of one University is suc
cessful without the support of the
other." President Wheeler spoke
feelingly and earnestly, saying,
among other things:
" The old story of the upward
struggle of man towards civilization
has been the story of a struggle
against the barriers which time and
space have set, and in this struggle
man is increasing his strength.
When'he has brought together out
of the spaces what is scattered
lavishly there in the chaos of things
and set them in order he has created
for himself power and control.
What else, indeed, is wealth, except
that things scattered abroad in the
chaos have been brought together?
Man rises out of his slavery to a
triumph over space.
" What is the university for, ex
cept to liberate men, to liberate
men from this slavery and from the
phantom dread of the present, and
teach them that to live they should
live as part of a great whole that
reaches out into the past and shall
be completed only in the future.
"In the University no institu
tion is more the institution of the
university than the library. It
stands to teach men that lives now
being lived in the present are not
being read aright unless they are
read in the succession of events, ex

"People of Stanford, I bring you
greeting from the people df Berke

house you have builded, in the
goodly store of human experience
that you are gathering into books
you are storing upon your shelves.
We shall rejoice in the growing
strength and in eveiy book that is

added to the Library of Stanford

and better things in this State."
Dr. Horatio Stebbins, represent
ing, as President Jordan said, the
Board of Trustees, himself, and all
other good people, said in part:
"We are here today to celebrate
the opening of the Library, the gift
of one of the kinsmen of the found
ers. \Y r hat is a library? what is it
for? how do you use it? A library,
as 1 understand it, is a spot on this
earth where the records of mankind
are brought together, where the
thought, the histories, the actions,
the imaginations of the race are
brought to a focus. There dwell
the spirits of the mighty dead.
They walk to and fro in the mid
night hours, the ghosts that govern
the world. The library is the re
pository of all that has been
thought, said, done, or heard by.
human kind.
"How shall we use a library?
That is a profounder question than
admits of discussion here, and 1 am
not here to give guidance to any
body or to any body of men. How
to use a library? I speak now, as
1 may, to this fair concourse of
young women and young men.
How to use a library depends on
your view of education itself,
whether an education is for train
ing the mind or for stocking the
mind, whether you are here as a
student or as a general reader, and
whether you can distinguish in
your minds the difference between
study and reading. If there is a
tedious man on earth to me it is
what is commonly called a 1 well
informed ' man. What we want is
power of thought. My friends, in
tellectual honesty is much more
rare than moral honesty. There
are more men who intend to be
honest than there are that can
think consecutively and know what
they are about.
" And now to the students of the
University, a word. I am not
preaching to you, my young friends,
but I have one word to say to you.
Distinguish first of all in the use of
a library the difference between
reading and studying. They are
distinct things. One is the use of
the library as an aid to your
studies; the other is to use your
library for that general intelligence,
that inspiration and information
that go to make up a cheerful man,
a warm heart, and an inspiring
spirit. For this end, stick to your
studies. l)o not be diverted by
general reading, wandering about
through millions of acres of general
reading, millions of acres that a
bullock couldn't get his living off.
"Literature — what is it? what
do you mean by it? In the large
sense it is that golden chain which,
fastened to the earth and reaching
to heaven, keeps up the human race
from barbarism, and leads them on
to the final destiny that God has
appointed."
Yesterday afternoon, by appro
priate exercises, the Thomas Wel
ton Stanford Library was formally
dedicated, and the longed-for home
for our books turned over to the
uses for which it was intended.
Trustees, faculty, alumni, students,
and friends gathered to celebrate
the occasion and event. President
Wheeler of California, with Librar
ian Rowell and students from
there, came over to show their in
terest and satisfaction in our new
possession, the former, on entering
the room, being greeted with hearty
applause. The Assembly Hall,
where the exercises were held, was
comfortably filled.
After an invocation by Rev. T.
F. Burnham of Vallejo, Librarian
H. C. Nash told, in a carefully pre
pared speech, something of the pro
gress of the Stanford Library since
the opening of the University in
1891. The first year, the speaker
said, " The librarian had to satisfy
the hunger of six hundred profes
sors and students on three thousand
volumes, but the next year saw ma
terial progress when five thousand
volumes were added and Mr. Tim
othy Hopkins presented us with
the Railway library, the most com
plete of its kind in the United
States." And continuing, later in
the address, " When we move into
our new quarters next week we shall
take with us forty-five thousand
books especially selected by the
heads of the different departments
of the University, with the single
purpose of always obtaining the
best authority on each particular
subject. The Library has grown in
a steady, healthy manner in all its
departments, and it has not only
not stopped growing at this time,
but it is shooting up so rapidly
that, as the Kansas man said of
the corn in his State, 'You can
it growing.'"
In closing, Mr. Nash said: "And
some of us who work for libraries
in this State have other and broader
hopes for the future. We have had
various visions of a practical con
solidation of the large libraries of
California, whether University,
State, or city, and especially of a
closer union of the libraries of the
two universities, with a view to the
greatest advantage to the largest
number of students, whether they
hail from Berkeley or Palo Alto.
"If, in moving to our new build
ing, we can say in truth, 'Old
things have passed away; behold,
all things are become new,' still
there is one thing I trust will never
pass away—Stanford's feeling of
glorious gratitude to those who
have made both the old and the
new possible."
Dr. Cleorge E. Howard, head of
the History department, was then
introduced by President Jordan as
the speaker of the day. He said in
part:
"To realize the full significance
of the library as a culture factor,
three propositions may be consid

ered: (1) Our generation has wit
nessed the birth of a new science
and a new profession ; (2) as an
educational institution, the open
library is a necessity of social evo
lution ; (3) the open library is des
tined to become the. safeguard of
triumphant democracy."
After sketching under the first
two heads the wonderful growth of
the library in this and other coun
tries, both as a scientific develop
ment and as a primal factor in
social progress, Dr. Howard spoke
of the library as the safeguard of
American democracy.
"It requires no argument," he
said, "to show that a full mind is
a good preparation for citizenship.
The undisciplined conscience is al
ways a treacherous guide. But
what is the precise quality of the
informing influence imparted by
the systematic reading of good
books? That is the point which it
will pay us somewhat more exactly
to consider.
" For more than half a century
after its origin our republic was
looked upon with curiosity or su
percilious toleration by most for
eign observers as decidedly a most
hazardous experiment. It seemed
a strange thing that there should
be a vast and rapidly expanding
nation in which exists no govern
ing class, no group of men whose
hereditary function it is to special
ize in administration and statecraft.
On the contrary, in the newborn
democracy the plain people were
expected to take upon themselves
the duties and privileges incident
to self-rule. Each voter was re
quired to be a specialist in the high
functions of social self-help.
" It is perhaps not surprising
that men steeped in the traditions
of monarchy and aristocracy should
have predicted, first, anarchy and
then, speedy dissolution. One trav
eler, indeed, there was, possessing
more ability than all the others
put together, who thought quite
differently. Some sixty years ago
De Tocqueville, the only serious for
eign student of our institutions be
fore Bryce wrote his Commonwealth,
gave expression to his faith in the
perpetuity of American democracy.
He perceived a conservative ele
ment in our society which he be
lieved would be our safeguard
against the rashness and fickleness
and passion of popular judgment.
This conservative element he found
in our lawyers, who, he saw, were
our leaders in local and national
politics. On the whole the opinion
of De Tocqueville has thus far been
justified by experience. The Amer
ican bar, with its well-known rev
erence for established institutions,
has been a powerful conservative
force in the nation. In the older
commonwealths, and in the Federal
Congress, at any rate, it is largely
due to the lawyer that our political
mistakes have not been more disas
trous.
" But a new crisis has at length

arisen. We now stand face to face
with conditions which demand a
conservative force with a much
broader foundation than can be
supplied by any one class or pro
fession, however numerous, wise, or
powerful. Once again, there are
many who seem to think that the
fears of those early observers may
after all be justified. Political cor
ruption, economic ignorance, and
industrial greed are having the
natural consequences. For our vast
and complex population, the bread
and-butter problem is getting harder
and harder. Withal the lawyers
are themselves on trial. Legal
ism and the shameful miscarriage
of justice through the tortuous
trickery of judicial process are
breeding suspicion and hatred. A
great political party has voiced the
sentiment of millions that even the
Federal courts, however uncon
sciously, have drifted in the nat
ural course of precedent into a
practical alliance with the alleged
plutocratic enemy of organized la
bor. Instead of being received as
a protector, legal conservatism is
now harshly arraigned as a social
enemy. Indeed the pessimist who
despairs of the Republic is abroad
in the land.
" Yet how little does the pessim
ist appreciate the capacity of Amer
ican society for self-protection.
There is of a truth, crying need of
a conservative force whose founda
tion shall be as broad as the basis
of citizenship. That forCe must be
supplied by a popular education
whose latest differentiated organ
and whose very symbol is the open
library. In one sense, it must be
confessed, there is more truth in
Pope's epigram that 'a little learn
ing is a dangerous thing' than the
poet ever dreamed of. Especially
is this so when the little learning is
all on one side of a serious ques
tion; though in that event much
learning of the same lop-sided sort
would be a good deal more perilous.
It is just here that the exclusive
feeding upon the partisan news
paper has threatened to become a
national calamity. The hired lies
and cynical half-truths of the typ
ical party ' organ' are a deadly
poison, which would surely corrupt
the heart and paralyze the brain of
the social body were a proper anti
dote not forthcoming. Here is the
real source of the anarchy and in
humanism which endanger Amer

"How shall we use a library?
That is a profounder question than
admits of discussion here, and 1 am
not here to give guidance to any
body or to any body of men. How
to use a library? I speak now, as
1 may, to this fair concourse of
young women and young men.
How to use a library depends on
your view of education itself,
whether an education is for train
ing the mind or for stocking the
mind, whether you are here as a
student or as a general reader, and
whether you can distinguish in
your minds the difference between
study and reading. If there is a
tedious man on earth to me it is
what is commonly called a 1 well
informed ' man. What we want is
power of thought. My friends, in
tellectual honesty is much more
rare than moral honesty. There
are more men who intend to be
honest than there are that can
think consecutively and know what
they are about.
" And now to the students of the
University, a word. I am not
preaching to you, my young friends,
but I have one word to say to you.
Distinguish first of all in the use of
a library the difference between
reading and studying. They are
distinct things. One is the use of
the library as an aid to your
studies; the other is to use your
library for that general intelligence,
that inspiration and information
that go to make up a cheerful man,
a warm heart, and an inspiring
spirit. For this end, stick to your
studies. l)o not be diverted by
general reading, wandering about
through millions of acres of general
reading, millions of acres that a
bullock couldn't get his living off.
"Literature — what is it? what
do you mean by it? In the large
sense it is that golden chain which,
fastened to the earth and reaching
to heaven, keeps up the human race
from barbarism, and leads them on
to the final destiny that God has
appointed."
