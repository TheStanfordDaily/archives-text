In another column appears the
announcement of a meeting of can
didates for positions on the staff of
the Daily Palo Alto. No one
who intends to interest himself in
this paper during his college career
should put off action in so doing.
Seniority, it is true, ranks below en
energy and ability in the matter of
promotion, but the man who has ex
perience gained by active work has
a backing which counts for much.
Here, by the literary man or
woman, may be gained valuable
training for participation in the
field of professional journal
ism. But in University life, also,
it is work which goes hand in hand
with many departments of college
training.' It has been the dream
of many of our predecessors that
work upon University publications
will some day be recognized as reg
ular University work, and credit
given accordingly. That, of course,
would stimulate the journalistic
spirit among students, for there
are many who would like to inter
est themselves, and feel that it
would be of as much benefit to
them as are their University courses
in general. It is a simple question

of University credits, however,
which decides the question for
them. Whether these hopes will
be realized or not, it is impossible
to tell, but, as it is, work upon the
student publications will amply re
pay anyone who can afford the
time, and an early beginning is sure
to bring the best results.
