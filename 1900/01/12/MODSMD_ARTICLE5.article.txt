With the dedication yesterday
afternoon of the Thomas Welton
Stanford Library we were given one
more occasion to be grateful to our
benefactors, and to realize again
how hopelessly we are becoming
indebted to those who have made
possible our existence here at Stan
ford. Although outwardly formal,
the exercises of dedication were
impressive to those who realize
something of the love and affection
from Thomas Stanford and Mrs.
Stanford, which are a part of every
stone and pillar in the beautiful
structure which from henceforth is
to be ours. The occasion was one
of rejoicing, too, showing as it did
that there is finally ready for our
use and enjoyment such a great
aid to college work as a modern
library building is. Almost daily,
in one form or another, there comes
to us a reward for the hopes we
have held for better times in the
future. This last one is perhaps
the greatest we have had since the
decision of the Government suit
five or six years ago. Let us enjoy
it as it is wished that we enjoy it,
and in that will our benefactors be
repaid far better than they could
be in any other way.
