# SUNDAY SERMON.
## Dr. J.K. McLean Conducts the First Service oi the Year. 
### 
Dr. J. K. McLean of Oakland
preached the regular Sunday ser
mon yesterday morning, choosing
for his text, "And he sendeth forth
two of his disciples and saith unto
them, 'Go into the city, and there
shall meet you a man bearing a
pitcher of water: follow him.'"
Mark xv: 13. Dr. McLean said in
part:
"1 want to cull your attention
to this man with the pitcher; I
never knew him intimately until
lately, but I have got much from
him: more, possibly, than from
the more conspicuous personages of
the New Testement, such as Peter
or Paul, with whom I can hardly
keep step, but with this man I can
walk along on terms of companion
ship and I want to introduce you
to him.
"This verse relates to the prepar
ation for the last Passover feast of
Christ. This feast has done more
to keep the Jewish people together
than any other thing. It must be
eaten standing, with the loins girt
and staff in hand, —a symbol of the
first great national movement. At
the time of which we speak the feast
must be celebrated at Jerusalem by
some member of each Jewish fam
ily. How should these outsiders
from all over Palestine be pro
vided for ? Here was a house
holder who had a large upper room
and, I presume, had prepared a
lamb and other necessities for the
feast in order to increase his re
serves a little. You can see how
insignificant a man carrying a
pitcher of water would be; yet he
was a part of the celebration of the
feast. But he was more than that,
for a new festival was to be ordained
and the feast of the Eucharist was
to take the place of the Passover,
and the man with the pitcher was
an essential service renderer of the
new feast and therefore stands as
an unconscious representative of the
multitudinous agencies working to
gether for the glory of God. Jesus
teaches us to pray, "Thy kingdom
come," and the new form of religion
was to be the opening wedge of the
new kingdom. I am glad to be
lieve that there is an innumerable
company working for this kingdom,
whose names are not on any church
roll and this unconscious water
carrier is a type of these.
" I presume it is safe to say that
one hundred thousand people were
necessary, directly or indirectly, to
make possible our beautiful library
lias it ever occurred to you that it
has taken generations of people to
make one book ? Now, in a
broader sense the world's multitud
inous agencies are combining to
bring in the kingdom of God.
Every conquestof the higher over the
lower tends to make nearer the day
when civilization shall be a perfect
one. But bringing it down to a
more personal level: 1 can con
ceive that this man had high aspir
ations; and how does it happen that
he was doing woman's work, car
rying water ? Sullenly, perhaps,
he tilled his pitcher at the well and
went on his way bemoaning his lot,
but he was bringing water which
should grace the first Lord's Supper

and with which the Son of God
should set the example of humility
by washing the disciples' feet.
"And so it is that I may find
some comfort with this man. It
is not given to us common folk to
be apostleß or high priests. We
must be the humblest servitors and
I point to the man with the pitcher
and give him as an example of the
vast multitude of humble servitors
whose smallest service, we have it
on the authority of the Lord Jesus
himself, is not lost. That man
with the pitcher, I shall look for
him if lam so fortunate as tostand
on the hills of God, —I have served
more faithfully and worked more
hopefully since I have had ac
quaintance with him.
" The consideration of a thought
like this tends to dignify what we
call commonplace, for the smallest
incident may have great effect
upon our lives. There is no com
monplace; all life is full of dig
nity."
