So fau this year we have not
heard of the Chess Club. If this
organization is to do anything this
semester, especially nr. ake any pre
tensions to an intercollegiate tour
nament, there is an evident ne
cessity for some decided activity.
Stanford has never won a match
from her rival across the bay for
the simple reason that the students
here have never been enough inter
ested to get to work in time to make
the best possible showing. A win
ning chess team is not the product
of a few weeks' practice, but of con
scientious and studied effort over a
long period. No group of players
who do not intend to work should
be allowed to arrange for outside
matches in the name of Stanford
University. If we are to continue
matches in chess with Berkeley,
our chess interests should be organ
ized and oflicially sanctioned. We
would suggest the appointment by
the Executive Committee of the

Associated Students of a chess man
ager, thus bringing this branch of
intercollegiate contests more closely
to the student body at large. Either
something of this kind must be
done or we should take action to
drop chess from the list of intercol
legiate events.
