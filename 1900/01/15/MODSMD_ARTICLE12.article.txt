# Berkeley Opens.
## 
### 
The University of California
opened today for the spring term,
and regular instruction began this
afternoon. As there were no regu
lar entrance examinations, few new
students are expected, but it is
estimated that about one hundred
new students, mainly graduates,
will enter.
There will be but few changes in
th work for this Be mester, as the
recent reductions in the amount of
prescribed work, and the increase
in the freedom of elective studies,
will not go into effect until this
fall. After this year only six hours
of mathematics will be required of
the students in the Colleges of Let
ters, Social Sciences, and Natural
Sciences.
