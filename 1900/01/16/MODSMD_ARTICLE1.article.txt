# FIFTH ANNUAL CONCERT TOUR.
## Stanford Musicians Greet Old Friends and Make New Ones in a Series of Fine Concerts. 
### 
The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs are home again, having added
to their record a successful and
eventful tour of over three weeks in
Southern California. The flatter
ing mention which the press every
where has given the organization
gives an idea of the enthusiasm
with which this season's program
has been received and the way in
which the men have imbued old
Stanford towns with new spirit and
gained a sure foothold in places
never before visited. The men are
pretty well fatigued with their long
journey, but aie satisfied with their
work which has been conscientious
from start to finish. Twenty-seven
men, including Treasurer Leiter,
made the trip. The clubs did not
have their own car but were fre
quently furnished a day coacli for
their exclusive use.
The long trip began Wednesday
morning, Dec. '20th, when the clubs
left Palo Alto for San Luis Obispo,
which picturesque town was
reached in the early evening. The
beginning conceit iH always ragged
and in many ways an experiment;
moreover it is generally greeted by
a small audience. The opening
show in San Luis was no exception
in either particular, though it was
certainly better than many first
nights on other tours Friday was
spent in climbing Mt. Sari Luis
and seeing the interesting country
about. In the evening the clubs
proceeded by a narrow-guage line to
Los Olivas —a stage station where
night was spent in a remarkable
hotel. Early the next morning
the company swung out of Los Oli
vas in three mountain tallyhos for
a memorable drive through the
Santa Vnez valley, over the Coast
Range, and down to Santa Barbara
by tlie sea. There is probably not
in America a more interesting or
beautiful mountain road, and the
men enjoyed this experience to
the fullest. At 4 p.m. they drove
into Santa Barbara with pennants
flying. The men were met by
a reception committee headed by
Marylyn Main,'1*8, at the Arling
ton hotel, and many were enter
tained in private homes in thecity.
The concert was well managed and
made a social event. The large
and enthusiastic audience was an
inspiration to the men, and they
gave on this, the second night out,
one of the most creditable perform
ances of the season.
Sunday was spent in Santa Bar
bara. Monday morning the troupe
was rocked awake by the great
earthquake and proceeded to Ven
tura and spent most of Christmas
day driving about the streets sing
ing and giving the yell, and in
other legitimate advertising. An
immense and good-natured Christ
mas audience packed the hall in
the evening. The good reputation
of two years ago was more than
sustained, and the program was
lengthened by encores to three
times its length. The clubs es
caped the distressing train wreck
at Pomona by a day, but they en
countered the gloom and the effect
which the disaster had upon the

community. The clubs wired
ahead to Pomona to propose hav
ing the concert changed into a big
benefit performance for the fami
lies of the dead and injured, but
for lack of time to advertise, this
generous and graceful act on the
part of the clubs was not accepted.
The Pomona audience was small
and unresponsive and the earnest
efforts of the men to warm it up
were in general of no avail.
The clubs proceeded to Riverside
the following day, stopping several
hours in Los Angeles on the way.
Riverside, owing to indifferent ad
vance work, did not furnish as
large an audience as before, but as
to warmth of houses and quality
of program, the success of two years
ago was repeated. During the day
the men embraced the opportunity
to see the beautiful drives and or
ange groves for which this pretty
little city and its surroundings are
famous.
In San Bernardino the concert
had been definitely announced
scarcely two days in advance, but
the men, in spite of this unfortu
nate circumstance, were able by
lively advertising to fairly well fill
the house. The enthusiasm of the
audience was all that could be de
sired, but the theater should have
been, as before, filled to standing
room.
In Red lands the townspeople evi
dently turned out en masse. The
crowd was three times as large as
two years ago, and treble encores
were the order of the evening. The
splendid entererinment the men re
ceived at the hands of the manage
ment of the Casa Loma Hotel was
something they cannot forget. Red
lands is also remembered for the
delightful reception and dancing
party given the clubs by Mrs. Mor
rison, sister of Dr. Stillman, at her
beautiful villa near the town.
At Pasadena Stanford students
and friends met the clubs at the
station and took them to the pri
vate homes in the city, where they
were delightfully entertained dur
ing their stay there. The concert in
tin evening was given to a fine and
bri liant audience, which taxed the
ca| Hcity of the hail. Among those
pr< cent, who wanted to congratulate
th< entertainers was Robert J. Bur
del «, the famous humorist. The
cit people gave a party in the
He owi Green to the club after the
coi ,ert. If there is one town more
for Stanford than another, it is
Pa ittdena. Sunday was spent in
I'a ittdena and Los Angeles. The
coi.cert Monday in Los Angeles con
flicted with a score of local New
Vo.ir's events and the size of the au
die ice was not what was confidently
expected. It was nevertheless the
liir ;eht of the tour and the program

he San Diego date, the follow
in; night, was broken because the
clu > encountered a series of wash
out ? on the Santa Fe. A memorable
thi ty-six hours was spent in the
(hij coaches from Santa Ana to San
Ditgo. The club furnished enter
tainment to the two hundred ad

ditional belated passengers and
made two hundred friends. The
club played San Diego the next
night by cancelling the Coronado
date. This was certainly the
"star" concert of the tour. The
story of the washout was t>ood
advertising and standing room
was at a premium. The men,
in spite of the fatigue and sleepless
night, responded bravely to a storm
of recalls and gave a program three
times the usual length. Enter
tainment in private homes was
kindly furnished in San Diego.
A matinee was given in the Los
Angeles Normal School the follow
ing afternoon to live hundred en
thusiastic girls. The admission for
students was ten cents and they de
clared that it was worth it. The
ride to Bakersfield was. made by
night. Bakersfield was also a "star"
town. Every seat in the large new
theater was sold before 8 o'clock.
Oil discoveries have given this re
gion an air of prosperity which was
reflected in the size of the house.
Visalia, the next evening, was a
new town and the fair audience
present,'evidently composed mostly
of curiosity seekers, seemed sur
prised to find the entertainment
really worth while. Tulare, the
next night, gave the troupe a good
return welcome, and Hanford, the
day following, surprised the club
on their first visit by showing a
Stanford spirit second to none. The
men entertained the High and
Grammar schools here, as at other
places, during the afternoon, and
practically all the seats were sold
for the evening concert. One of the
good deeds of the club was to re
move the hoodoo from Fresno.
This town can mean "frost" no
longer. The people were tempted
out and well rewarded, so they said,
and the spirit of the papers was,
"Come again, Stanford, and the
theater will be overflowing."
The last two concerts were given
in Merced and Visalia respectively.
The High School Athletic Associa
tion managed the concert at Merced
and presented the club with a fine
audience. Here also the men be
came acquainted with a generous
personage called " Baldy." The
closing concert at Modesto was as
well rendered as any, in spite of the
fact that the musicians were almost
worn out. This was another well
filled house, scarcely a seat remain
ing unsold.
The program this year was in
some respects better than in any
revious season. The Glee Club is
well balanced and well drilled. It
displayed fine harmony and sang
the numbers decidedly well. The
experiment in the choice of songs,
however, was hardly a success, as
the people generally wanted and ex
pected a brighter and lighter class
of music. The Mandolin Club
played captivating music and its
every number was greeted with a
spontaneous burst of applause. It
won the complete favor of every au
dience and there is probably not a
mandolin club in the East or the
West which can excel it. The pro
gram was replete with fun and
novelties. On no previous tour has
Frank Riley's work been more con
scientiously given or more thor
oughly enjoyed. He was greeted in

the South iiH an old favorite and
could always he depended on to put
the house in the best of humor with
his-new selections. His aesthetic
and humorous power were shown
in " Uncle Eph's Heaven" and in
the " Laughing Song." B. A. Ols
hausen proved a stfir and his flute
solos were thu artistic feature of the
evening. He is complete master of
his instrument, und ever}' audience
gave him numerous recalls. Frank
Corhusier's imitations were Clevel
and the people could scarcely get
enough of them. He was always a
favorite and gave the program
much of its charm.
The student hody will endeavor
to raise a good part of the deficit
incurred by the concert next Friday
evening, and others to follow in the
future. It is not as large as Berke
ley's by half, and will probably be
entirely wiped out.

into Santa Barbara with pennants
flying. The men were met by
a reception committee headed by
Marylyn Main,'1*8, at the Arling
ton hotel, and many were enter
tained in private homes in thecity.
The concert was well managed and
made a social event. The large
and enthusiastic audience was an
inspiration to the men, and they
gave on this, the second night out,
one of the most creditable perform
ances of the season.
Sunday was spent in Santa Bar
bara. Monday morning the troupe
was rocked awake by the great
earthquake and proceeded to Ven
tura and spent most of Christmas
day driving about the streets sing
ing and giving the yell, and in
other legitimate advertising. An
immense and good-natured Christ
mas audience packed the hall in
the evening. The good reputation
of two years ago was more than
sustained, and the program was
lengthened by encores to three
times its length. The clubs es
caped the distressing train wreck
at Pomona by a day, but they en
countered the gloom and the effect
which the disaster had upon the

community. The clubs wired
ahead to Pomona to propose hav
ing the concert changed into a big
benefit performance for the fami
lies of the dead and injured, but
for lack of time to advertise, this
generous and graceful act on the
part of the clubs was not accepted.
The Pomona audience was small
and unresponsive and the earnest
efforts of the men to warm it up
were in general of no avail.
The clubs proceeded to Riverside
the following day, stopping several
hours in Los Angeles on the way.
Riverside, owing to indifferent ad
vance work, did not furnish as
large an audience as before, but as
to warmth of houses and quality
of program, the success of two years
ago was repeated. During the day
the men embraced the opportunity
to see the beautiful drives and or
ange groves for which this pretty
little city and its surroundings are
famous.
In San Bernardino the concert
had been definitely announced
scarcely two days in advance, but
the men, in spite of this unfortu
nate circumstance, were able by
lively advertising to fairly well fill
the house. The enthusiasm of the
audience was all that could be de
sired, but the theater should have
been, as before, filled to standing
room.
In Red lands the townspeople evi
dently turned out en masse. The
crowd was three times as large as
two years ago, and treble encores
were the order of the evening. The
splendid entererinment the men re
ceived at the hands of the manage
ment of the Casa Loma Hotel was
something they cannot forget. Red
lands is also remembered for the
delightful reception and dancing
party given the clubs by Mrs. Mor
rison, sister of Dr. Stillman, at her
beautiful villa near the town.
At Pasadena Stanford students
and friends met the clubs at the
station and took them to the pri
vate homes in the city, where they
were delightfully entertained dur
ing their stay there. The concert in
tin evening was given to a fine and
bri liant audience, which taxed the
ca| Hcity of the hail. Among those
pr< cent, who wanted to congratulate
th< entertainers was Robert J. Bur
del «, the famous humorist. The
cit people gave a party in the
He owi Green to the club after the
coi ,ert. If there is one town more
for Stanford than another, it is
Pa ittdena. Sunday was spent in
I'a ittdena and Los Angeles. The
coi.cert Monday in Los Angeles con
flicted with a score of local New

he San Diego date, the follow
in; night, was broken because the
clu > encountered a series of wash

thi ty-six hours was spent in the
(hij coaches from Santa Ana to San
Ditgo. The club furnished enter
tainment to the two hundred ad

ditional belated passengers and
made two hundred friends. The
club played San Diego the next
night by cancelling the Coronado
date. This was certainly the
"star" concert of the tour. The
story of the washout was t>ood
advertising and standing room
was at a premium. The men,
in spite of the fatigue and sleepless
night, responded bravely to a storm
of recalls and gave a program three
times the usual length. Enter
tainment in private homes was
kindly furnished in San Diego.
A matinee was given in the Los
Angeles Normal School the follow
ing afternoon to live hundred en
thusiastic girls. The admission for
students was ten cents and they de
clared that it was worth it. The
ride to Bakersfield was. made by
night. Bakersfield was also a "star"
town. Every seat in the large new
theater was sold before 8 o'clock.
Oil discoveries have given this re
gion an air of prosperity which was
reflected in the size of the house.
Visalia, the next evening, was a
new town and the fair audience
present,'evidently composed mostly
of curiosity seekers, seemed sur
prised to find the entertainment
really worth while. Tulare, the
next night, gave the troupe a good
return welcome, and Hanford, the
day following, surprised the club
on their first visit by showing a
Stanford spirit second to none. The
men entertained the High and
Grammar schools here, as at other
places, during the afternoon, and
practically all the seats were sold
for the evening concert. One of the
good deeds of the club was to re
move the hoodoo from Fresno.
This town can mean "frost" no
longer. The people were tempted
out and well rewarded, so they said,
and the spirit of the papers was,
"Come again, Stanford, and the
theater will be overflowing."
The last two concerts were given
in Merced and Visalia respectively.
The High School Athletic Associa
tion managed the concert at Merced
and presented the club with a fine
audience. Here also the men be
came acquainted with a generous
personage called " Baldy." The
closing concert at Modesto was as
well rendered as any, in spite of the
fact that the musicians were almost
worn out. This was another well
filled house, scarcely a seat remain
ing unsold.
The program this year was in
some respects better than in any
revious season. The Glee Club is
well balanced and well drilled. It
displayed fine harmony and sang
the numbers decidedly well. The
experiment in the choice of songs,
however, was hardly a success, as
the people generally wanted and ex
pected a brighter and lighter class
of music. The Mandolin Club
played captivating music and its
every number was greeted with a
spontaneous burst of applause. It
won the complete favor of every au
dience and there is probably not a
mandolin club in the East or the
West which can excel it. The pro
gram was replete with fun and
novelties. On no previous tour has
Frank Riley's work been more con
scientiously given or more thor
oughly enjoyed. He was greeted in

the South iiH an old favorite and
could always he depended on to put
the house in the best of humor with
his-new selections. His aesthetic
and humorous power were shown
in " Uncle Eph's Heaven" and in
the " Laughing Song." B. A. Ols
hausen proved a stfir and his flute
solos were thu artistic feature of the
evening. He is complete master of
his instrument, und ever}' audience
gave him numerous recalls. Frank
Corhusier's imitations were Clevel
and the people could scarcely get
enough of them. He was always a
favorite and gave the program
much of its charm.
The student hody will endeavor
to raise a good part of the deficit
incurred by the concert next Friday
evening, and others to follow in the
future. It is not as large as Berke
ley's by half, and will probably be
entirely wiped out.
The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs are home again, having added
to their record a successful and
eventful tour of over three weeks in
Southern California. The flatter
ing mention which the press every
where has given the organization
gives an idea of the enthusiasm
with which this season's program
has been received and the way in
which the men have imbued old
Stanford towns with new spirit and
gained a sure foothold in places
never before visited. The men are
pretty well fatigued with their long
journey, but aie satisfied with their
work which has been conscientious
from start to finish. Twenty-seven
men, including Treasurer Leiter,
made the trip. The clubs did not
have their own car but were fre
quently furnished a day coacli for
their exclusive use.
The long trip began Wednesday
morning, Dec. '20th, when the clubs
left Palo Alto for San Luis Obispo,
which picturesque town was
reached in the early evening. The
beginning conceit iH always ragged
and in many ways an experiment;
moreover it is generally greeted by
a small audience. The opening
show in San Luis was no exception
in either particular, though it was
certainly better than many first
nights on other tours Friday was
spent in climbing Mt. Sari Luis
and seeing the interesting country
about. In the evening the clubs
proceeded by a narrow-guage line to
Los Olivas —a stage station where
night was spent in a remarkable
hotel. Early the next morning
the company swung out of Los Oli
vas in three mountain tallyhos for
a memorable drive through the
Santa Vnez valley, over the Coast
Range, and down to Santa Barbara
by tlie sea. There is probably not
in America a more interesting or
beautiful mountain road, and the
men enjoyed this experience to
the fullest. At 4 p.m. they drove
into Santa Barbara with pennants
flying. The men were met by

ange groves for which this pretty
little city and its surroundings are
famous.
In San Bernardino the concert
had been definitely announced
scarcely two days in advance, but
the men, in spite of this unfortu
nate circumstance, were able by
lively advertising to fairly well fill
the house. The enthusiasm of the
audience was all that could be de
sired, but the theater should have
been, as before, filled to standing
room.
In Red lands the townspeople evi
dently turned out en masse. The
crowd was three times as large as
two years ago, and treble encores
were the order of the evening. The
splendid entererinment the men re
ceived at the hands of the manage
ment of the Casa Loma Hotel was
something they cannot forget. Red
lands is also remembered for the
delightful reception and dancing
party given the clubs by Mrs. Mor
rison, sister of Dr. Stillman, at her
beautiful villa near the town.
At Pasadena Stanford students
and friends met the clubs at the
station and took them to the pri
vate homes in the city, where they
were delightfully entertained dur
ing their stay there. The concert in
tin evening was given to a fine and
bri liant audience, which taxed the
ca| Hcity of the hail. Among those
pr< cent, who wanted to congratulate
th< entertainers was Robert J. Bur
del «, the famous humorist. The
cit people gave a party in the
He owi Green to the club after the
coi ,ert. If there is one town more
for Stanford than another, it is
Pa ittdena. Sunday was spent in
I'a ittdena and Los Angeles. The
coi.cert Monday in Los Angeles con
flicted with a score of local New
Vo.ir's events and the size of the au
die ice was not what was confidently
expected. It was nevertheless the

he San Diego date, the follow
in; night, was broken because the
clu > encountered a series of wash
out ? on the Santa Fe. A memorable
thi ty-six hours was spent in the
(hij coaches from Santa Ana to San
Ditgo. The club furnished enter
tainment to the two hundred ad

ditional belated passengers and
made two hundred friends. The
club played San Diego the next
night by cancelling the Coronado
date. This was certainly the
"star" concert of the tour. The
story of the washout was t>ood
advertising and standing room
was at a premium. The men,
in spite of the fatigue and sleepless
night, responded bravely to a storm
of recalls and gave a program three
times the usual length. Enter
tainment in private homes was
kindly furnished in San Diego.
A matinee was given in the Los
Angeles Normal School the follow
ing afternoon to live hundred en
thusiastic girls. The admission for
students was ten cents and they de
clared that it was worth it. The
ride to Bakersfield was. made by
night. Bakersfield was also a "star"
town. Every seat in the large new
theater was sold before 8 o'clock.
Oil discoveries have given this re
gion an air of prosperity which was
reflected in the size of the house.
Visalia, the next evening, was a
new town and the fair audience
present,'evidently composed mostly
of curiosity seekers, seemed sur
prised to find the entertainment
really worth while. Tulare, the
next night, gave the troupe a good
return welcome, and Hanford, the
day following, surprised the club
on their first visit by showing a
Stanford spirit second to none. The
men entertained the High and
Grammar schools here, as at other
places, during the afternoon, and
practically all the seats were sold
for the evening concert. One of the
good deeds of the club was to re
move the hoodoo from Fresno.
This town can mean "frost" no
longer. The people were tempted
out and well rewarded, so they said,
and the spirit of the papers was,
"Come again, Stanford, and the
theater will be overflowing."
The last two concerts were given
in Merced and Visalia respectively.
The High School Athletic Associa
tion managed the concert at Merced
and presented the club with a fine
audience. Here also the men be
came acquainted with a generous
personage called " Baldy." The
closing concert at Modesto was as
well rendered as any, in spite of the
fact that the musicians were almost
worn out. This was another well
filled house, scarcely a seat remain
ing unsold.
The program this year was in
some respects better than in any
revious season. The Glee Club is
well balanced and well drilled. It
displayed fine harmony and sang
the numbers decidedly well. The
experiment in the choice of songs,
however, was hardly a success, as
the people generally wanted and ex
pected a brighter and lighter class
of music. The Mandolin Club
played captivating music and its
every number was greeted with a
spontaneous burst of applause. It
won the complete favor of every au
dience and there is probably not a
mandolin club in the East or the
West which can excel it. The pro
gram was replete with fun and
novelties. On no previous tour has
Frank Riley's work been more con
scientiously given or more thor
oughly enjoyed. He was greeted in

the South iiH an old favorite and
could always he depended on to put
the house in the best of humor with
his-new selections. His aesthetic
and humorous power were shown
in " Uncle Eph's Heaven" and in
the " Laughing Song." B. A. Ols
hausen proved a stfir and his flute
solos were thu artistic feature of the
evening. He is complete master of
his instrument, und ever}' audience
gave him numerous recalls. Frank
Corhusier's imitations were Clevel
and the people could scarcely get
enough of them. He was always a
favorite and gave the program
much of its charm.
The student hody will endeavor
to raise a good part of the deficit
incurred by the concert next Friday
evening, and others to follow in the
future. It is not as large as Berke
ley's by half, and will probably be
entirely wiped out.
