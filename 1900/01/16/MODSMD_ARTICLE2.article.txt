Incidents of the Varsity Holiday
Trip Through Washington
and Oregon.
The northern trip of the Varsity
eleven during the vacation resulted
in one defeat and one victory. Im
mediately after the University
closed for the semester the men
went to work at signal practice
twice a day, and when the lime
came for leaving they were in the
best of condition. Fifteen men,
besides Coach Chamberlin and
Manager Berry, left the University
on the 29th, and arrived at Port
land on the 31st, where they were
joined by Captain Murphy, who
had gone on before to his home in
Salem. The trip over the moun
tains was thoroughly enjoyed by
all, and many snowball battles oc
curred in which Manager Berrv
was the principal object of attack.
The game on New Year's day
with the Multnomah Club was
somewhat of a surprise to the Stan
ford men, as they did not think
their opponents sc strong. The
weather had cleared & little, and a
large crowd was out to witness the
game. A small booly of Stanford
students and alumni gathered to
gether in the grandstand and en
couraged the team with good yel 1-
ing.
Although the gnands were in
very bad condition, the game was
interesting from the beginning, and
very little fumbling occurred. Stan
ford kicked off, and Multnomah
worked the ball dowr the field for a
touch-down without tosing posses
sion of it. The goal was kicked,
and the score stood 6 9 in favor of
Multnomah. Stanford kicked off
again, Kerrigan fumbled and Mc-
Fadden fell on the ball. Stanford
then tried the Carlisle trick of
throwing all the team on one side
and Fisher carried the ball over in
three successive trials. With an
even score both teamy slaved slow
for the end of the Half. Only
three minutes tim«* was left.
Murphy was forced to kick, the ball
went low, and striking Fisher,
bounced back over the line, Husk
falling on it. No goal was kicked
and the score stood 11-6 in favor of
Multnom ah.
In the second half Stanford took
a brace and kept the ball in Mult
nomah's territory throughout the
half, but was unable to score.
Murphy was compelled to retire
about the middle of the second half
and Raitt took his place, while
Wrigley went in at guard, relieving
Huston. The best work for the
Varsity was done by Fisher and Erb
back of the line, and McFadden
and Traeger in the line. Among the
members of the Multnomah team
were McMillan, Rusk, and Kerri
gan, all former Stanford students.
McMillan was responsible for Mult
nomah's victory; he played right
half and made long gains through
the line.
The game at Seattle resulted in
a victory of 28-0 in the Varsity's
favor. The Seattle team was com
posed of experienced men but they
had had but little team work.
Stanford used the Carlisle play
with telling effect and always
made good gains, while their op
ponents did not at any time make
the necessary five yards. Fum
bling was frequent on both sides,
but Stanford got the best of it
The rain and the muddy field pre
vented rapid work, and the men
were pretty well exhausted when
time was called. Three touch
downs were made in the first half
and two goals kicked. In the sec
ond, two touch-downs were made
and one goal, making the final
score '28-0. Those whose work was
specially noticeable in this game
were Fisher, Erb, McFadden, De
Forest, and Traeger.
At Seattle the members of the
squad attended a reception and
dance given in their honor by
Miss Leora Conn, '03. The follow
ing morning they took the boat for
San Francisco, stopping at Vic
toria, B. C., where they attended
the opening session of Parliament.
The men who composed the team
were: McFadden, Traeger, DeFor
est, Lee, Wrigley, Bentley, Parker,
Murphy, Erb, Fisher, and Ru
dolph. Substitutes: Raitt, Huston,
Nourse, Beckley, and John.
Coach Chamberlin referred the
Portland match and "Top" Pome
roy, '97, was time kesper. Nourse,
'00, acted as linesiian in both
games.
