Incidents of the Varsity Holiday
Trip Through Washington
and Oregon.
The northern trip of the Varsity
eleven during the vacation resulted
in one defeat and one victory. Im
mediately after the University
closed for the semester the men
went to work at signal practice
twice a day, and when the lime
came for leaving they were in the
best of condition. Fifteen men,
besides Coach Chamberlin and
Manager Berry, left the University
on the 29th, and arrived at Port
land on the 31st, where they were
joined by Captain Murphy, who
had gone on before to his home in
Salem. The trip over the moun

all, and many snowball battles oc

and the score stood 6 9 in favor of
Multnomah. Stanford kicked off
again, Kerrigan fumbled and Mc-
Fadden fell on the ball. Stanford
then tried the Carlisle trick of
throwing all the team on one side

three successive trials. With an
even score both teamy slaved slow

three minutes timÂ«* was left.
Murphy was forced to kick, the ball
went low, and striking Fisher,
bounced back over the line, Husk
falling on it. No goal was kicked
and the score stood 11-6 in favor of
Multnom ah.
