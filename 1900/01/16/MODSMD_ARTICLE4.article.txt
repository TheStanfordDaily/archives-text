The annual injunction to "keep
off the baseball field " seems to be
in order again. Every year as soon
as the ropes are removed from the
grounds there appears a well de
fined path across the field. The
management this year will endeavor
to put the field in the best possible
condition, but they cannot keep it in
that way if it is allowed to become
a public thoroughfare. This need
not be the case if each student
will be careful to walk around
and not across the field. Every
year the warning is given, but it
falls on deaf ears. The students
seem either too lazy or too careless
to. think it necessary to keep off the
field. Evidently u .o more press
ing means will have to be taken to
prevent the same trouble this sea
son than a mere statement of the
case.
