As THE semi-annual period of
class elections draws near, the inkn*
ner in which they I ave often been
conducted in the pa it recurs to our
older students. Some new method
has often been suggested, but al
ways too late to be taken advan
tage of for any particular election.
Several weeks remain before
the class elections of this semester,
and the various class councils, if
they choose, have time to arrange
for a more satisfactory vote than
has been taken in the past. In the
Eastern Universities, instead of the
candidates being chosen at a class
meeting of short duration, polls
are kept open fo"* a considerable
length of time it some central
point. The election is under the
control of the executive committee
of the class. By n«ing the system
of balloting a larger vote would un
doubtedly be pr>l>»»d, as it would
give members of '-he class who
could not attend a meeting at

an hour inconvenient to them, an
Opportunity to $ote. not
be amiss for the classes at their
first meeting to take some action
by which their councils would be
made a more important feature of
their organization, and at the same
time more satisfactory elections be
held. Otherwise, after the officers
are chosen, no one should grumble
if the proceedings were not satis
factory to him.
