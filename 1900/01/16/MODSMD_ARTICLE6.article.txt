The concert to be given in the
Assembly Hall on Friday evening
merits the support of the entire
student body. The fact that the
members of the musical clubs de
rive a great deal of pleasure from
their annual tours should not make
us take the stand that they ought
to bear the burden of whatever de
ficit is incurred. The members of
the clubs work hard before starting
on their trips so as to bring credit to
themselves and their Alma Mater,
and whatever enjoyment they get
from their concert season is-justly
due them, especially when they
succeed in gaining such favorable
notices as were given this year in
the local papers of the towns vis
ited. While heartily in sympathy
with the system of insurance against
loss which the Associated Students
impose on the clubs, we strongly
feel that the people of the Univer
sity should stand by them when
they ask our support as they are
now doing.
