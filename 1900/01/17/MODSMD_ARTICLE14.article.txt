Baseball has taken a good start.
All along the line there is a general
awakening ; ihe players are work
ing earnestly ; the coach is tireless
in his efforts to bring out all there
is in the candidates ; the manager
has provided for all the wants of
the players, and has put the dia
mond in good shape. Nothing is
lacking ; even the time-honored cry,
" Why don't the rooters get out!"
cannot be raised. The rooters are
out in force. If we can only hold
our present pace throu fe hout the
season, that erstwhile baseball
championship will come back home.
