# FIRST MUSICAL OF SEMESTER.
## Mr. Savannah and Mr. Fickenscher Treat a Stanford Audience to Rare Entertainment. 
### 
The recital of last evening may
be said to be in many respects the
most notable in the series of musi
cals given during the year. The
entire program was furnished by
Samuel I. Savannah, violinist,
and Arthur Fickenscher, pian
ist*—both of them experienced con
cert players, and both having gen
uine claims as artists. The play
ing of Mr. Savannah possesses un
usual virility and distinctness, and
these qualities are made even more
delightful by the player's bearing
and ease on the stage. The first
selection was from Suite G. Min.
by Franz Hies, in which the musi
cians seemed somewhat cold. The
next time they appeared together,
however, in the Son ate G. Min. by
Arthur Foote, the impression was
quite changed. Especially in the
Andantino and Adagio did they
display deep sympathy with each
other and with their audience.
Here by his unobtrusive yet
individual work Mr. Ficken
scher proved himself an accompan
ist of really rare ability. The
second number was a piano solo
which called out as an encore an
impromptu by Chopin. In this
and in the Campanella by Liszt,
the pianist showed great technique.
And were there not something
lacking outside of the realm of mere
technique, Mr. Fickenscher might
be called a great pianist.
