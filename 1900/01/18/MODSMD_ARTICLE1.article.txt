# DR. WARNER PASSES AWAY
## Death Came to Him Last Evening in New Mexico. 
### 
Dr. Amos Griswold Warner, head
of the department of Economics
and Sociology in the University,
died in Los Cruces, New Mexico, at
7:80 o'clock last evening. The
cause of death was consumption,
contracted in 18V)4, and brought to
a final head by a hemorrhage,
which was the immediate cause of
his demise.
Dr. Warner came to Stanford
University in 1893 when the de
partment of Economics was -till in
embryo. Under his direction the
department was brought into life
and launched on its successful
career. The summer following his
arrival, and after a year's hard
work, he started together with a

number of other
members of the fac
ulty, for an outing
in King's River
Canyon. At the
time the party had
planned to set out
the famous A. R. U.
strike was on and
no trains running.
This necessitated
making the trip by
way of Stockton on
the river boat,
vv hi c h was so
crowded that Dr.
Warner, :i mo n g
others, was com
pelled to spend t he
ni<: ht on the pilot
house, contracting
a severe cold
which, aggravated
by a month's ex
posure in the moun
tains away from
any medical ad
vice, developed into
the dread disease
which finally took
him away. Al
though ill, Dr.
Warner remained

at his post in the University un
til the December following his ex
posure, when he left in an en
deavor to regain his health in the
interior. In September, 18!)7, he
returned to his work in the depart
ment, to remain, however, but one
semester, after which he again
sought relief in a dryer climate.
For the past year he has been in
New Mexico making a desperate
tight for life. Here Mrs. Warner
and his two children remained by
his side until the last. Nothing us
to the arrangements for the fu
neral are yet known.
Professor Warner's home was in
lioca, Nebraska. He took the de
gree of B. L.from the University of
Nebraska in 1885, and I'll. I), from
Johns Hopkins University in 1888.
From 1887 to 1889 he was general
agent for the Charity Organization
Society of Baltimore. From 1887
to 185)1 he was professor of political
economy in the University of Ne
braska, while occupying that posi
tion offering the first course on cor
porations to he given in the United
States. The two years following he
spent es superintendent of charities
in Washington, D. (J.

Dr. Warner's work was done
chiefly in lines of charity work and
organization, and in corporations.
His work entitled American Char
ities, published in 1894, is recog
nized as a standard work by all
charity workers. He has also pub
lished many magazine articles of
great value.
Although not definitely known,
it is expected that Mrs. Warner
and her two children will return to
Palo Alto in the near future.
President Jordan is arranging a
special service in Dr. Warner's
memory, which will be held soon.
President Jordan, Dr. Roes, Mrs.
Smith, and others will speak of the
deceased and of the esteem in which
he was always held by the co
workers in his profession.
