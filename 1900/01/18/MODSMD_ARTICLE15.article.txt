# THE 						LIBRARY BUILDING.
## Interior Arrangement of the Structure Which Will Be Occupied 
### 
Tomorrow.
In July of 1898, not many
months after Mrs. Stanford had
formulated the plan and received
from Thomas Welton Stanford
his approval, ground was broken
for the library building that bears
above its portal the latter's name.
Work progressed steadily upon the
walls, and by April of the succeed
ing year the outside stones were set.
Then came less rapid steps forward,
but each month has added its part,
and today the abode of books is
ready for opening its doors, eighteen
months after the turning of the soil.
The building, together with that
of the assembly hall, which, though
having no interior connection with
the library, is an integral part of
its architectural plan, is the first to
be completed in the series of the
Greater Quadrangle and as such
marks the beginning of the new
University.
Looking south from the entrance,
through the arboretum to the new
structure's front, much of the old
simplicity is seen, it being dift'eren
tiated only in height. Passing,
however, to the eastern end toward
the inn, one is struck by the inno
vation of rounded corner towers and
of many gables, jutting one above
the other.
The new buildings are connected
with the old by an open corridor,
leading from the corner of the
former library. This corridor con
tinues as on the quadrangle along
the face of the buildings and will
form, with the completion of the
outer series, a superb covered
promenade something like a half
mile in length, completely sur
rounding the two systems.
The main structure of the Li
brary measures BGxl6o feet. With
in it on the first floor is the reading
room, 09x70 feet, containing twen-

ty-six study tables each with indi
vidual sections for eightâ€”four to
a side. These sections give greater
privacy than was possible with
the old tables To each of them
leads an electric circuit for the
individual goose-neck incan
descent lamps. .The floor of
the room is of cement as are those
of the entire building, which is
fireproof.
On either side of the main room !
arched passages give entrance to j
two smaller rooms, 40x25 feet.
The northern room at the east end ,
is to contain the Hopkins Railway
Library; the southern room on the j
same end will be given over to an
innovation of much value, a refer-;
ence room, where those books most
in use may be taken without the.

use of cards, the student having
direct access to the shelves. West
of the main reading-room on the
north is the conference room, an
other valuable innovation, where
students may repair for library
consultation; the southern room of
this end will be used for catalog
ing purposes. There is in these
four reading-rooms accommodation
for 300 students.
On the second floor, to which ac
cess is had by marble stairs at
either side of the reading-room,
besides the gallery and the period-'
ical room immediately in front, are
six seminary rooms. In the east
ern end is, first to the north the
economics seminary, followed by
the education, with the history in
the southern room. West of the
gallery comes in the same order
the French and German, the Latin
and Freek, and the English semi
nary apartments.
In the southern wall above the
gallery have been placed three
stained glass windows, the product
of Charles Lamb and Sons of New
York. Hunt, the artist, is said to
consider the central one,
"Christ Knocking at the Door," his
masterpiece. To the left as one
views them from the floor of the
reading room, sits Moses with the
tables of thecommandments; to the
right the monk, Thomas k Kempis.
The windows facing as they do the
southern sun burn with a wonder
ful brilliance where the light strikes
through. These are the personal
gifts of Mrs. Stanford.
A hkylight forty feet in diameter
admits abundant and tempered
light through its stained glass panes.
The peak of this dome stands forty
feet from the main floor.
The stock room, 70x74 feet south
of the main building, has on its
three lloors space for 250,000 vol
umes. Hand hoists are in use for
the present, to convey the books to
the main floor.
Approximately $150,000 has been

expended upon the building, and
the generosity of the giver is more
apparent in its unselfish phase
when it known that in making the
donation nothing was indicated by
him as to the purpose to which the
money should be put. Jt came as
ia gift untrammeled by any specifi
cation that it should be used in a
way that might create for himself
I a memorial.
