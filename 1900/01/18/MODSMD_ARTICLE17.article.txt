# BASEBALL PRACTICE.
## Prospects for the Spring's Work on the Diamond.—Dr. Murphy Interviewed. 
### 
Baseball has begun in earnest.
p]very afternoon after four o'clock
a crowd of men are out on the dia
mond being put through their paces
by Coach Murphy and Captain
Strohn. The work began last
Monday and as yet has only con
sisted of in-field and out-field work
with some batting practice. Sat-

urday will witness the first line-up
practice.
In an interview with Dr. Murphy
today he said: "The men who are
at present on the field are working
hard and earnestly. The only
fault I have to find with them is
that they do not get out promptly
at four o'tdock so that the practice
can begin then. At present the
necessity for being on time is not so
urgent as it will he when regular
line-up practices begin. When
regular practices begin tardiness
will not be tolerated."
"One more thing I should like
to say, I want to see more men on
the field. We have not enough
men out in suits by one-half the
number. In football last season
eighty men used to turn out, while
for baseball we have a paltry eigh
teen or twenty. We ought to have
at least forty men on the field every
evening. Then we could have ma
terial to choose from. The old men
we now have on the field can be so
changed around that if a new man
should show sufficient form in the
position occupied by an old player,
this new man would be given the
place, and the old man switched to
a osition where he would be equally
valuable to the team. I say this to
show all new men that they have a
chance for the team. There are
nine positions to be filled, and no
places are cinched."
A glance over the material at
hand shows some likely looking
candidates trying for Varsity hon
ors. In the infield Edwards,
Lougheed, and Captain Strohn are
holdovers from last year. Edwards
will undoubtedly hold down third
again, unless he can be more advan
tageously ÜBed elsewhere. Lougheed
will go in the outfield if a better
man can be found for his old posi
tion at shortstop. He may also
take a turn behind the bat.
Wherever he goes he is a valuable
man for the team. From present
indications it looks as if Cap
tain Strohn will do the backstop
work. Horn and Cowden, besides
Lougheed, are trying for catcher.
If any of these three can hold down
the place, Strohn will go back to
his old station at second base.

Of the new talent Cowden, a
sophomore, is the best. He han
dles himself well, and is a quick,
accurate fielder. His throwing is
true and speedy, and he has some
thing of a reputation as a batsman.
He is trying for second base and
catcher. Symonds, '01, is another
man whose work gives promise.
There are some six or eight other
candidates for infield positions.
"Doc" Young's record at first
will be a hard mark for any of this
yeai's candidates to reach. Traeger,

Horn, Dutton and Phillips are the
possibilities for the guardianship of
the initial bag. They are all about
equal. They have everything to
learn. They are eager to learn
it.
Candidates for the outfield are
more numerous than for the infield.
Murphy, who has not yet appeared
upon the field on account of the in
:jury that he received last football
! season, is the only fielder left. No
line can be had on the new men.
Their work so far gives thepron ise
|of a speedy lot of outfielders. On
past records, Havens, Braden, and
Knapp appear to be in the lead of
the others. A good b;ilter has an
excellent show to secure one of the
two vacant places in the outfield.
►Should Lanagan meet with an
accident the team would he in a
| tight place. At present he is the
only man capable of going into the
box against Berkeley. Dr. Murphy
is on the lookout for pitching ma
terial. Lowenthal and Traeger are
being given a trial. Both men
: have speed that promises well.
Manager Haslacher has secured a
complete, well arranged schedule of
games for the team. Beginning
with a week from next Saturday,
the team will have one or two
games each week until the champ
l ionship series. The nine will play
j Santa Clara, the Fireman's Fund
team, and some of the professional
teams. All but three or four of the
games will be played on the campus.
I Haslacher has started an innova
tion in arranging a game with
Berkeley and Santa Clara on our
campus. The same day that Berke
ley plays at Stanford, our team will
I cross bats with the Fireman's Fund
team on California's home dia
mond. In the championship series
the preliminary games will be
played on the college campuses,
while the deciding game will be
played at Recreation Bark in San
Francisco.
The schedule of games with the
Fireman's Fund team is as follows:
January 27th, campus; February
10th, San Francisco; February 22d,
campus; February 24th, San Fran
cisco, March 10th, campus; March
24th, San Francisco.

Baseball has begun in earnest.
p]very afternoon after four o'clock
a crowd of men are out on the dia
mond being put through their paces
by Coach Murphy and Captain
Strohn. The work began last
Monday and as yet has only con
sisted of in-field and out-field work
with some batting practice. Sat-

urday will witness the first line-up
practice.
In an interview with Dr. Murphy
today he said: "The men who are
at present on the field are working
hard and earnestly. The only
fault I have to find with them is
that they do not get out promptly
at four o'tdock so that the practice
can begin then. At present the
necessity for being on time is not so
urgent as it will he when regular
line-up practices begin. When
regular practices begin tardiness
will not be tolerated."
"One more thing I should like
to say, I want to see more men on
the field. We have not enough
men out in suits by one-half the
number. In football last season
eighty men used to turn out, while
for baseball we have a paltry eigh
teen or twenty. We ought to have
at least forty men on the field every
evening. Then we could have ma
terial to choose from. The old men
we now have on the field can be so
changed around that if a new man
should show sufficient form in the
position occupied by an old player,
this new man would be given the
place, and the old man switched to
a osition where he would be equally
valuable to the team. I say this to
show all new men that they have a
chance for the team. There are
nine positions to be filled, and no
places are cinched."
A glance over the material at
hand shows some likely looking
candidates trying for Varsity hon
ors. In the infield Edwards,
Lougheed, and Captain Strohn are
holdovers from last year. Edwards
will undoubtedly hold down third
again, unless he can be more advan
tageously ÜBed elsewhere. Lougheed
will go in the outfield if a better
man can be found for his old posi
tion at shortstop. He may also
take a turn behind the bat.
Wherever he goes he is a valuable
man for the team. From present
indications it looks as if Cap
tain Strohn will do the backstop
work. Horn and Cowden, besides
Lougheed, are trying for catcher.
If any of these three can hold down
the place, Strohn will go back to
his old station at second base.

Of the new talent Cowden, a
sophomore, is the best. He han
dles himself well, and is a quick,
accurate fielder. His throwing is
true and speedy, and he has some
thing of a reputation as a batsman.
He is trying for second base and
catcher. Symonds, '01, is another
man whose work gives promise.
There are some six or eight other
candidates for infield positions.
"Doc" Young's record at first
will be a hard mark for any of this
yeai's candidates to reach. Traeger,

Horn, Dutton and Phillips are the
possibilities for the guardianship of
the initial bag. They are all about
equal. They have everything to
learn. They are eager to learn
it.
Candidates for the outfield are
more numerous than for the infield.
Murphy, who has not yet appeared
upon the field on account of the in
:jury that he received last football
! season, is the only fielder left. No
line can be had on the new men.
Their work so far gives thepron ise
|of a speedy lot of outfielders. On
past records, Havens, Braden, and
Knapp appear to be in the lead of
the others. A good b;ilter has an
excellent show to secure one of the
two vacant places in the outfield.
►Should Lanagan meet with an
accident the team would he in a
| tight place. At present he is the
only man capable of going into the
box against Berkeley. Dr. Murphy
is on the lookout for pitching ma
terial. Lowenthal and Traeger are
being given a trial. Both men
: have speed that promises well.
Manager Haslacher has secured a
complete, well arranged schedule of
games for the team. Beginning
with a week from next Saturday,
the team will have one or two
games each week until the champ
l ionship series. The nine will play
j Santa Clara, the Fireman's Fund
team, and some of the professional
teams. All but three or four of the
games will be played on the campus.
I Haslacher has started an innova
tion in arranging a game with
Berkeley and Santa Clara on our
campus. The same day that Berke
ley plays at Stanford, our team will
I cross bats with the Fireman's Fund
team on California's home dia
mond. In the championship series
the preliminary games will be
played on the college campuses,
while the deciding game will be
played at Recreation Bark in San
Francisco.
The schedule of games with the
Fireman's Fund team is as follows:
January 27th, campus; February
10th, San Francisco; February 22d,
campus; February 24th, San Fran
cisco, March 10th, campus; March
24th, San Francisco.
