# MUSICAL CLUB CONCERT.
## What Outsiders Have Said of Our Glee and Mandolin Clubs. 
### 
The return concert of the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs tomorrow
evening in the assembly hall is in
reality the opening of the new audi
torium so far as its use by a stu
dent body organization is con
cerned. The annual campus con
cert of the musical clubs, sifter suc
cessful or unsuccessful trips, is a
regular feature of their existence
and should be looked forward toby
the student body as the test of
these organizations, in much the
same way as the athletic events of
the year are regarded. In the past
the chapel has always been crowded
for these concerts, and limited ca
pacity has always given rise to a
lament that the new assembly hall

was not finished.
Since that want is
filled, it remains to
be seen how much
of a, real demand
from the student
body there was for
such an auditor
ium.
The in u s i c a 1
clubs this year have
stood in closer re
lation to the stu
dent body than
ever before, and it
has been the aim of
the Executive Com
mittee to put them
on a more popular
footing. The clubs
deserve s u p port
from the he rty
way they have as
sisted in this effort.
As far as ability
goes, the Glee Club
is above any previ
ous organization,
and its music is of
a higher order, al
though humor and
point of course are
not, birltina TIip

Mandolin Club is the best Stanford
has ever turned out, and is sup
ported ably by Mr. Olshausen on
