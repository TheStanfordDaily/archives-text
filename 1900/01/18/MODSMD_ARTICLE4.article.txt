# MUSICAL CLUB CONCERT.
## What Outsiders Have Said of Our Glee and Mandolin Clubs. 
### 
The return concert of the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs tomorrow
evening in the assembly hall is in
reality the opening of the new audi
torium so far as its use by a stu
dent body organization is con
cerned. The annual campus con
cert of the musical clubs, sifter suc
cessful or unsuccessful trips, is a
regular feature of their existence
and should be looked forward toby
the student body as the test of
these organizations, in much the
same way as the athletic events of
the year are regarded. In the past
the chapel has always been crowded
for these concerts, and limited ca
pacity has always given rise to a
lament that the new assembly hall

was not finished.
Since that want is
filled, it remains to
be seen how much
of a, real demand
from the student
body there was for
such an auditor
ium.
The in u s i c a 1
clubs this year have
stood in closer re
lation to the stu
dent body than
ever before, and it
has been the aim of
the Executive Com
mittee to put them
on a more popular
footing. The clubs
deserve s u p port
from the he rty
way they have as
sisted in this effort.
As far as ability
goes, the Glee Club
is above any previ
ous organization,
and its music is of
a higher order, al
though humor and
point of course are
not, birltina TIip

Mandolin Club is the best Stanford
has ever turned out, and is sup
ported ably by Mr. Olshausen on
the flute. For specialties the clubs
are fortunate in having Riley
and Corbusier, besides Olshausen,
all of whom made hits on the
trip.
The following program will be
given :
PART FIRST.
" Hark, the Trumpet Calleth "

" Charlatan March "

" Fiddle-de-dee " Glee Club

On the southern trip the clubs
inside the best reputation that any
college organizations have made on
a tour. While stranded at Ocean
side they furnished music for the
passengers, and the next evening in
Han Diego it was noticeabl ethat the
majority of them were again present
in the audience. At several places
the club men met those who had
been in the audience at other places.
The press clippings reproduced give
a good idea of the nature and char
acter of the concert. There will be
room for every one and everyone
should come.

Encore Night at Redlands.
It was "encore night" at the
Academy last night, for every num
ber given by the Stanford Glee and
Mandolin Clubs was encored one
or more times. 1 he merry music
of the fresh young voices carries a
contagion with it, which makes
iiged hearers young again. 1 he
sprightly music of the Mandolin
Club showed most careful training
upon selections of a good character,
and the playing was in excellent
style. The rendering of "Bohe
mian Girl'' was especially line.
F. B. Riley possesses unusual talent

as a mimic, and his impersonations
''brought down the house." It is
doubtful if his equal has been seen
among the young men who have
appeared upon the mimic stage of
Redlands. B. A. Olshausen blows
through his llute musical breath,
and the liquid notes awakened sym
pathetic chords in the hearts of his
hearers. The boys deserved and
had a large and appreciative au
dience. After the performance the
clubs were entertained with a din
ner and dance by Mr. and Mrs. K.
P. Morrison at their Highlands
avenue home, a number of friends
having been invited to meet them.

Gerlinger at San Bernardino.
The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Club delighted an appreciative au
dience at the opera house last night.
The choruses were all splendidly
rendered and the playing (112 the'
Mandolin Club was unusually ex
cellent.
Too much praise cannot be given
to the work of Frank B. Riley,
whose monologues and character
impersonations were a real delight.
Mr. Riley does work far in advance
of that done by the average profes
sional, and lias a bright future
should he decide to adopt the stage
as a calling.
Mr. Gerlinger also deserves espec
ial mention for his song, " A moutil
ado Sherry," which was much
above theaverage.- San Bernardino
Free I'rexs, Ike. 20, 1800.
At San Diego.
Postponed entertainments are
usually financial failures, but last
night's concert of the Stanford Glee
and Mandolin Clubs at Unity Hall
was a remarkable exception to the
rule. The hall was packed to the
doors, and the audience remained
wildly enthusiastic to the close of
the program, demanding encores
after every number.
Frank B. Riley, comedian, and
Mr. Corbusier, impersonator, imita
tor, and ventriloquist, were the
heroes of the evening. The latter is
a remarkably clever artist and
could doubtless get an engagement

with the greatest specialty com
panies in the country. His imita
tion of a wood sawyer anil his en
counter with a little dog was one of
the funniest things ever heard in
this city.
15. A. Olshausen gave a very
beautiful iiutesolo, which was much
appreciated, and the work of the
Mandolin Club was very good.
Generally speaking the program
was light and arranged for the pop
ular taste.
After the concert the members of
the cluhs were the guests of the
Decern Club of young ladies in a
delightful dance which lasted until
midnight.—San Diego Sun, Jan.

Farewell to Los Angeles.
The Stanford boys were torn from
! our midst this morning by a special
car and a concert date at San Diego
tonight. One of the jolliest expe
riences in college life is swinging
around the circle with the Glee
Club, and the Stanford men are
getting out all the fun there is in it.
They have been on the road since
December 20th, starting at San
Luis Obispo, and breaking all the
hearts in the citrus belt. They have

The Los Angeles Concert.
l)e Pachmann by no means mon
opolized music-loving Angelenos
last night, if one might judge by
the splendid audience assembled to
greet the Stanford boys at the
Los Angeles Theater. Sprinkled
throughout the audience were well
known society and professional
people.
The (ilee Club is well balanced.
Its tone quality is decidedly good,
and is marred l>y no objectionable
voices. The work of the club would
not suffer by comparison with that
of similar organizations of our best
known Eastern colleges.
The singing of "To Arms, to
Arms 1" as well as some of the
more unpretentious, but in their way
not less difficult songs, is worthy of
flattering comment.
The work of the Mandolin Club
was hardly less deserving of credit
than that of the Glee Club. The
playing of the encore waltz and of
the rag-time music approached sat
isfaction as nearly as one could ex
pect from the tinkling mandolin
and guttural guitar.
F. B. Riley in his impersonations
, showed himself capable of doing
well a better class of work. The
pathetic darkey dialect, sketch,
" Uncle Kph's Heaven," was spe
cially good.
Frank A. Corbusier's imitations
were amusing and well done.

M any of the
sweet singers of the
cllib have gained
distinction in other
ways. There are
among the number

two prominent football inen and
several track athletes.
One of the most enjoyable fea
tures of the concert last night was
the work of Riley, the monologist.
Should Riley ever take it into his
head to go into the vaudeville, he
will be a head-liner, sure.
There are few men in the busi
ness who do anything cleverer than
Riley's monologue of last year on
the " Broken Engagement."
This season he has a new one,
| which meets with much favor. A*,
the Pasadena concert Bob Burdette
i chanced to be in the audience, and
; was delighted with Riley. When
! the curtain went down the famous
humorist-preacher came around be
hind, and without waiting to be
| introduced, grabbed Riley and
hugged him.
" You're all right, boy," he said.
Before the club left Mr. Burdette
presented him with a copy of each
of his books as a token of appre
ciation.
The tlute soloist, Bruno Olshau
sen, who won much praise and ap
plause last night, is a Los Angeles
boy. Several years ago a doctor re

instrument for the benefit of his
health, and Olshausen selected the
tlute quite at random.

Frank B. Riley, comedian, and

a remarkably clever artist and

The return concert of the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs tomorrow
evening in the assembly hall is in
reality the opening of the new audi
torium so far as its use by a stu
dent body organization is con
cerned. The annual campus con
cert of the musical clubs, sifter suc
cessful or unsuccessful trips, is a
regular feature of their existence
and should be looked forward toby
the student body as the test of
these organizations, in much the
same way as the athletic events of
the year are regarded. In the past
the chapel has always been crowded
for these concerts, and limited ca
pacity has always given rise to a
lament that the new assembly hall

was not finished.
Since that want is
filled, it remains to
be seen how much
of a, real demand
from the student
body there was for
such an auditor
ium.
The in u s i c a 1
clubs this year have
stood in closer re
lation to the stu
dent body than
ever before, and it
has been the aim of
the Executive Com
mittee to put them
on a more popular
footing. The clubs
deserve s u p port
from the he rty
way they have as
sisted in this effort.
As far as ability
goes, the Glee Club
is above any previ
ous organization,
and its music is of
a higher order, al
though humor and
point of course are
not, birltina TIip

Mandolin Club is the best Stanford
has ever turned out, and is sup
ported ably by Mr. Olshausen on
the flute. For specialties the clubs
are fortunate in having Riley
and Corbusier, besides Olshausen,
all of whom made hits on the
trip.
The following program will be
given :
PART FIRST.
" Hark, the Trumpet Calleth "

" Charlatan March "

" Fiddle-de-dee " Glee Club
Impersonations. . . .Frank B. Riley

" Heinz Yon Stein " Glee Club
" Stnokey Mokes ". . Mandolin Club
" The Sunset Limited "
. F. A. Corbusier and (J lee Club
" Evening " Glee Club
On the southern trip the clubs
inside the best reputation that any
college organizations have made on
a tour. While stranded at Ocean
side they furnished music for the
passengers, and the next evening in
Han Diego it was noticeabl ethat the
majority of them were again present
in the audience. At several places
the club men met those who had
been in the audience at other places.
The press clippings reproduced give
a good idea of the nature and char
acter of the concert. There will be
room for every one and everyone
should come.

Encore Night at Redlands.
It was "encore night" at the
Academy last night, for every num
ber given by the Stanford Glee and
Mandolin Clubs was encored one
or more times. 1 he merry music
of the fresh young voices carries a
contagion with it, which makes
iiged hearers young again. 1 he
sprightly music of the Mandolin
Club showed most careful training
upon selections of a good character,
and the playing was in excellent
style. The rendering of "Bohe
mian Girl'' was especially line.
F. B. Riley possesses unusual talent

as a mimic, and his impersonations
''brought down the house." It is
doubtful if his equal has been seen
among the young men who have
appeared upon the mimic stage of
Redlands. B. A. Olshausen blows
through his llute musical breath,
and the liquid notes awakened sym
pathetic chords in the hearts of his
hearers. The boys deserved and
had a large and appreciative au
dience. After the performance the
clubs were entertained with a din
ner and dance by Mr. and Mrs. K.
P. Morrison at their Highlands

having been invited to meet them.

dent body organization is con
cerned. The annual campus con
cert of the musical clubs, sifter suc
cessful or unsuccessful trips, is a
regular feature of their existence
and should be looked forward toby
the student body as the test of
these organizations, in much the
same way as the athletic events of
the year are regarded. In the past
the chapel has always been crowded
for these concerts, and limited ca
pacity has always given rise to a
lament that the new assembly hall

was not finished.
Since that want is
filled, it remains to
be seen how much
of a, real demand
from the student
body there was for
such an auditor
ium.
The in u s i c a 1
clubs this year have
stood in closer re
lation to the stu
dent body than
ever before, and it
has been the aim of
the Executive Com
mittee to put them
on a more popular
footing. The clubs
deserve s u p port
from the he rty
way they have as
sisted in this effort.
As far as ability
goes, the Glee Club
is above any previ
ous organization,
and its music is of
a higher order, al
though humor and
point of course are
not, birltina TIip

Mandolin Club is the best Stanford
has ever turned out, and is sup
ported ably by Mr. Olshausen on
the flute. For specialties the clubs
are fortunate in having Riley
and Corbusier, besides Olshausen,
all of whom made hits on the
trip.
The following program will be
given :
PART FIRST.

" Charlatan March "

On the southern trip the clubs
inside the best reputation that any
college organizations have made on
a tour. While stranded at Ocean
side they furnished music for the
passengers, and the next evening in
Han Diego it was noticeabl ethat the
majority of them were again present
in the audience. At several places
the club men met those who had
been in the audience at other places.
The press clippings reproduced give
a good idea of the nature and char
acter of the concert. There will be
room for every one and everyone
should come.

Encore Night at Redlands.
It was "encore night" at the
Academy last night, for every num
ber given by the Stanford Glee and
Mandolin Clubs was encored one
or more times. 1 he merry music
of the fresh young voices carries a
contagion with it, which makes
iiged hearers young again. 1 he
sprightly music of the Mandolin
Club showed most careful training
upon selections of a good character,
and the playing was in excellent
style. The rendering of "Bohe
mian Girl'' was especially line.
F. B. Riley possesses unusual talent

as a mimic, and his impersonations
''brought down the house." It is
doubtful if his equal has been seen
among the young men who have
appeared upon the mimic stage of
Redlands. B. A. Olshausen blows
through his llute musical breath,
and the liquid notes awakened sym
pathetic chords in the hearts of his
hearers. The boys deserved and
had a large and appreciative au
dience. After the performance the
clubs were entertained with a din
ner and dance by Mr. and Mrs. K.
P. Morrison at their Highlands
avenue home, a number of friends
having been invited to meet them.

Gerlinger at San Bernardino.
The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Club delighted an appreciative au
dience at the opera house last night.
The choruses were all splendidly
rendered and the playing (112 the'
Mandolin Club was unusually ex
cellent.
Too much praise cannot be given
to the work of Frank B. Riley,
whose monologues and character
impersonations were a real delight.
Mr. Riley does work far in advance
of that done by the average profes
sional, and lias a bright future
should he decide to adopt the stage
as a calling.
Mr. Gerlinger also deserves espec
ial mention for his song, " A moutil
ado Sherry," which was much
above theaverage.- San Bernardino

At San Diego.
Postponed entertainments are
usually financial failures, but last
night's concert of the Stanford Glee
and Mandolin Clubs at Unity Hall
was a remarkable exception to the
rule. The hall was packed to the
doors, and the audience remained
wildly enthusiastic to the close of
the program, demanding encores
after every number.
Frank B. Riley, comedian, and
Mr. Corbusier, impersonator, imita
tor, and ventriloquist, were the
heroes of the evening. The latter is
a remarkably clever artist and
could doubtless get an engagement

with the greatest specialty com
panies in the country. His imita
tion of a wood sawyer anil his en
counter with a little dog was one of
the funniest things ever heard in
this city.
15. A. Olshausen gave a very
beautiful iiutesolo, which was much
appreciated, and the work of the
Mandolin Club was very good.
Generally speaking the program
was light and arranged for the pop

people.
The (ilee Club is well balanced.
Its tone quality is decidedly good,
and is marred l>y no objectionable
voices. The work of the club would
not suffer by comparison with that
of similar organizations of our best
known Eastern colleges.
The singing of "To Arms, to
Arms 1" as well as some of the
more unpretentious, but in their way
not less difficult songs, is worthy of
flattering comment.
The work of the Mandolin Club
was hardly less deserving of credit
than that of the Glee Club. The
playing of the encore waltz and of
the rag-time music approached sat
isfaction as nearly as one could ex
pect from the tinkling mandolin
and guttural guitar.
F. B. Riley in his impersonations
, showed himself capable of doing
well a better class of work. The

One of the most enjoyable fea

the work of Riley, the monologist.

head to go into the vaudeville, he
will be a head-liner, sure.
There are few men in the busi

Riley's monologue of last year on
the " Broken Engagement."
This season he has a new one,
