In the death of Dr. Amos Gris
vvold Warner there passes a man
whose place can not be refilled. Not
only did he occupy a position at
Stanford so distinctive, both in the
character of his teachings and his
qualities as a man, that he will be
missed so long as his name is
known, but his work as a scholar
and a leader in the active world in
which he was so potent a factor be
fore coining to our University was
of such strength and practicability
that there too will there be a va
cant chair. His cheerful nature,
his power, his sympathy, his com
mon sense combined to make of
him a man who,once known, could
never be forgotten. But his end
has finally come, and we must ac
cept the inevitable as lie himself
accepted it, never ceasing, however,
to regret that we are to see him no
more, nor to rejoice that he was
once an active force among us.
