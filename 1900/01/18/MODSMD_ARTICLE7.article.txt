With this issue the Daily Palo
Alto places before the students
something of an account of what
their musical clubs have done for
Stanford by their tour, and a few
of the press notices which they
have received. At the beginning
of last semester the student body
took steps to bring these organiza
tions more directly under its con
trol. With the principles of this
movement we thoroughly agree.
While further advances toward stu
dent control can undoubtedly be
made in these its well as other Uni
versity organizations, a start has
always to be made, and this year
was as well as any to begin. It,
cannot be carried in one season as
far as might be best, but that it is
started in the right direction means
much to Stanford interests. As a
result, the students at large should
show an interest in the success of

their plan proportionate to the part
they have taken in its initiation.
They should embrace the opportu
nity which will be given them to
morrow evening of seeing for them
selves how it has worked, that they
may more fairly judge questions of
student control which will un
doubtedly arise in the future.
