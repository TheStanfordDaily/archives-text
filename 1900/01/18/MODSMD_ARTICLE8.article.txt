By no means the least impor
tant of the offices which the three
upper classes will lie called upon to
fill at their regular elections is that
of treasurer. The close of the sec
ond semester in the past has seen
too many classes financially em
barrassed through the careless
ness or incapacity of its officers.
Class affairs have to be undertaken
involving considerable expenditures
and endangering the class credit
unless closely managed. Before the
Sophomores will soon be brought
up the question of issuing their
1902 Annual. They need but recur
to the first waitings of previous
Junior classes to realize how much
the matter of careful financiering
means to them. The Juniors have
before them a"last year of class ex
istence with its many enterprises.
The Seniors must plan to pay the
bills which they will incur in the
celebration of their commencement
in order that class credit may be
handed to their successor as untar
nished as it was received. It means
much to all the classes, and no
matter can better receive their con
scientious thought.
