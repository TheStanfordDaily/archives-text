# TRACK PROSPECTS.
## Present Candidates for Participation in the Annual Field-day. 
### 
Track work has not progressed
much this semester. Very few men
have come out so far. Dr. Murphy
says there should be at least forty
men training, while at present there
are not more than fifteen out for
any sort of work. The full train
ing was not carried on system
atically, so that the results will de
pend on the condition the men
work up to this semester.
A meeting of track men was held
last September and about thirty
signed for the track. Besides this
number there are probably twenty
more who should come out and
thus give the trainer material to
work with.
This year's team will be weak
ened by the lo'ss of Charlie Dole
in the pole vault and hurdles,
Smith and Williams in the dis
tances, and Prall and Birtch, point
winners in last year's meet. Berke
ley will have the best team it
has had for several years, as the
management has been holding out
the inducement of an Eastern trip
to a winning team.
Among the old men whom Stan
ford is counting on mostly are
Stewart, Boyd, and Chadbourne.
Of the new men the most prom
ising are: Naramore, from Santa
Clara High School, with a good
record in the broad jump ;
10. A. Smith from Denver, who
holds the Colorado record in
the quarter mile ; Cutter of
San Jacinto and Chaffey College,
with good showing made on tin*
pole-vault, weights, and jumps ;
Traeger, from Portervilie the Var
sity tackle, who runs the quarter
in good time, and is fair at the
weights ; Pollard, Los Gatos, hur
dles ; Paul Parker, brother of Garth
Parker, shot-put ; N. E. Dole,
Charlie Dole's brother, jumps and
pole-vault ; Copp, Boston Latin
School, sprints.
Trainer Murphy says that he
does not believe in working the
men too hard, and will give them
only light exercise for several weeks,
trying them out in their especial
events every three or four days.
Manager Cantwell has had the
track rolled and leveled, and it is
now in good shape, and will be
kept so throughout the season.
Manager Cantwell announced that
the student body will stand half
the expense for spikes for any per
son who will train during the sea
son.
There are plenty of places on the
team for men who are willing to
train in the right way, and every
one who can do anything, or can
hope to do anything, on the track
should come out and make a try.
