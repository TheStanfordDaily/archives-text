The willingness witli which stu
dents assisted in moving the books
from the old into the new library,
while not, perhaps, deserving of any
special commendation, —for what
Stanford student could have done
differently ?—should at least receive
passing mention as an example of
Stanford spirit. The work was done
with earnestness and care, and fully

iii accordance with the directions
given by those in charge. As a
result, every man who carried a
book to its new home, and every
woman who placed a volume on its
shelf, feels a double pride to see the
new stacks put to their intended
use. So much is given us at
Stanford, even without the asking,
that there has arisen from time to
time, from some oneoutof harmony
with our life, a wail that Stanford
students are ungrateful. In conse
quence is it gratifying to have op
portunities, slight though they must
be, for Stanford men and women to
show what their true feeling is.
