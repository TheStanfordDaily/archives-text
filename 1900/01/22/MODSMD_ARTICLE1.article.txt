# ATHLETIC RECOMMENDATIONS AT BERKELEY.
## No Official Response Yet Received by the Faculty Committee. 
### 
While no official answer has been
received by the Faculty Committee
on Athletics to the propositions
which they sent to Berkeley last
semester, it is practically certain
that both universities will have
eastern coaches for the next foot
ball season. The matter was re
ferred to the students by the Berke
ley Faculty Committee, to which it
had been forwarded. The general
opinion of the students there is
well known to be against the sug
gestions, and they will no doubt be
rejected.
Professor Richardson, chairman
of the Faculty Athletic Committee,
when interviewed today, said:
"1 am satisfied that both uni
versities will have eastern coaches
next fall, but we have heard noth
ing official in regard to the matter.
"As regards the story that a
proposition is under consideration
to take the matter of deciding upon
the eligibility of players out of the
hands of the P. A. A., and give that
power to the faculty committees.we
are entirely ignorant. We have
heard nothing of any such idea."
The baseball mar agenient, when
interviewed, was likewise unac
quainted with any such proposition.
Manager Haslacher said that it is
the annual custom for protests of
some kind to be made, and he ex
pected this year would not be an
exception. The decision of the ama
teur standing of athletes rests en
tirely with the Pacific Amateur
Athletic Association, as that organ
ization is the recognized authority
on such subjects and is best qual
ified to judge. The students of
both universities will abide by such
a decision. Any protests received
from the University of California
will be referred to the association
this year, as has always been the
custom.
