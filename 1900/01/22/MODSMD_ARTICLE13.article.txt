We learn from the editor of the
1901 Annual that but little interest
is being taken among the students
in the prize contests for material for
the forthcoming Quad. There is
something lacking in student spirit
here which makes such a state of
affairs possible. As we have re
marked before, an annual is not
indicative merely of the literary
ability of the class publishing it,
but of the literary ability of the
whole University, and all who de
sire that Stanford should have a
good standing among those who
judge our student standard by the
character of the Quads we publish
should make it a point to see that
this index of our life is made as
complete jiihl strong as possible.
The time in which material for
this year's publication may be sub
mitted has been extended to the end
of this month. We hope that some
good copy, typical of Stanford life,
will be offered by that time.
