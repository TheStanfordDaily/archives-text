The Intercollegiate Car not, de
bate will be held in Berkeley, Febru

ary 9th â€”two weeks from next
Friday. Some action by the Ex
ecutive Committee looking to the
presence of a numerous Stanford
contingent of rooters and sym
pathizers at that important event
would be most opportune. An ex
tension of hospitalities by the home
university is always one of the
most pleasing accompaniments of
this annual debate, and this year,
assuredly, will not prove an excep
tion. It makes the contest more
interesting and more of a real test
when the partisans of either side
are more nearly equal in numbers.
As to the discouraging influence a
lack of support may have upon our
representatives nothing need be
said. They have our contidence;
they should have our presence and
active support at the contest. With
some one at the head and a unity
of effort, a body of Stanford rooters
might be taken across the 15ay
carrying with them such assurance
to our debaters as goes far toward
success. Two weeks is none too
long a time to organize such an ex
cursion, however. Let the Execu
tive Committee take the lead in the
matter and that at once.
