# Friday Evening Concert.
## 
### 
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
made their initial appearance in
the assembly hall Friday evening,
and everything combined to make
the occasion a pleasant one. There
was a large house, an enjoyable
program, and a cordial welcome
for the clubs. The entrance of the
Glee Clubwas tbesipnal forahearty
greeting from the audience and
from then on to the end every

number on the program was
warmly applauded, and encored
once and sometimes twice.
The Mandolin Club easily car
ried off the honors of the evening.
The excellent standing which the
club has attained this year is due
to the leader, J F. Lanagan, to
whom must be given the credit for
bringing out one of the best man
dolin clubs Stanford has ever had.
A pleasant feature of the program
was the flute solo by B. A. Ols
hausen.
The Glee numbers went with the
vim and dash characteristic of
college songs. Frank Riley gave
some clever impersonations, and
F. A. Corbusier delighted the audi
ence with his ventriloquistic tricks
and his whistling.
Altogether the concert was a
pleasant success and the clubs fully
deserve the warm words of praise
which they received in Southern
California.
