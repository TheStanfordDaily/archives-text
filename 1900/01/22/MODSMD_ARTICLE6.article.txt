# SUNDAY SERVICES IN THE CHAPEL.
## Professor Lovejoy Talks on "Religion and the Sense of Reason." 
### 
Prof. Arthur 0. Lovejoy spoke in
the chapel Sunday morning on
" Religion and the Sense of Rea
son." The speaker said in part:
" I want to talk this morning of
what religion means to each one of
us. Each new generation selects
from the mass of precept left by the
last generation certain rules of
thought and action by which to
guide its own conduct. Each man
selects his own legacy when he
reaches the age of thinking for him
self. One of these legacies is re
ligion.
"There was an old idea that a
man should embrace religion in or
der to insure future bliss; another
was that by prayer and supplica
tion we might so bend the will of
God to ours as to gain earthly
goods and comforts. These old
ideas and many others of a like na
ture have been discarded by most
of us. The question this morning
is, 'Is religion a thing which forms
an indispensable part of life?' We
of the University community are a
special people engaged in the culti
vation of a special virtue; that vir
tue has been called a scientific
spirit, or better, a sense of reality.
For to find a sense of reality is the
purpose of all literature, science,
and art. The man who lives a life
in the business or unintellectual
world is bewildered when he comes
here; he can realize 10 per cent, on
his investments and thinks this the
sole aim in life, and he cannot un
derstand that a thousand people
should be working for an end that
he knows nothing about. Just so
it is with religion, which may be
called the sense of reality in our
moral natures. A man was never
made religious by knowing the
proofs of the being of God. He
must first want to be religious.
" Now let our religion be such a
one as comports with the sense of
reality in things intellectual and
things moral. Let us not believe
things because others have done so.
Let us reduce our religion to that
pure level so that all men can share
it with us."
