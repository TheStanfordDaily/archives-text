# Philosophical Society.
## 
### 
A new organization has been
added to the list of societies for ad
vanced research at Stanford. Last
week a number of members of the
faculty and a few graduate students
met and organized a Philosophical
Society. The organization will be
of a purely informal nature at
present, although it hopes to be
come of importance with the devel
opment of the department of Phil
osophy. Dr. Lovejoy is at the head
of the society and was its organizer.
For the present the society will hold
meetings every month; informal
papers will be presented, and Prof.
William James' "Will to Believe"
will be discussed.
