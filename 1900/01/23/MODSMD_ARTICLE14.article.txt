We regret that we are com
pelled to announce the withdrawal
of the managing editor of the Daily
Palo Alto. A pressure of univer
sity work prevents him from de
voting the time to the position
which it demands. He will con
tinue the active interest in the
paper which he has shown for the
past three years, as an associate,
however, and devote to its benefit,
as far as his time will allow, the ex
perience which such a continued
service has given him.
