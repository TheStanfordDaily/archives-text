Considerable complaint has
reached us since the occupation of
the new library, from those who
have to use that building in the
evening, of the insufficiency of the
lights. The inadequacy of the
present lighting plant is realized by
the students, but it nevertheless
seems that sufficient lights might
be placed on the arcades so that
one could at least find his way after
dark to our principal building. As
it is, there is not even a light at the
corner of the assembly hall, and
one coming out of the library can
find the turning point only by the
aid of matches. The students
would much appreciate just one
more globe.
