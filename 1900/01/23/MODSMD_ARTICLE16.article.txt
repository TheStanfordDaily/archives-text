There are now open to the stu
dents of Stanford University two
fields of original work which will
bring both honor and financial
recognition. They are distinctly
different. One at least, the Cosmo
politan prize competition, is in
tended, not for the specialists in
philosophy, or economics, or en
gineering, but for those who have
that all-round development and
training that should characterize
such an institution as ours. The
other, the offer made before his

death by Dr. J. H. Stallard of
Menlo Park, while probably one
that will appeal most strongly to
the investigator on historical lines,
yet can well be followed by stu
dents of a more general culture.
Many prize competitions have back
of them as a motive the further
ance of some political demagogue's
pet scheme. These two appeal to
us, having been prompted by far
better ideas, and as being excep
tionally worthy. None of us can
know too well the principles which
should underly the education of the
average American citizen, and no
question comes up more frequently
in the decision of political questions
of the day than that dealing with
the applicability to our present-day
conditions of the original principles
enunciated in the Declaration of
Independence. We do not know to
what extent students are entering
into these competitions, but we
urge all who possibly can to do so.
They offer opportunities for dis
tinction to others than athletes and
debaters, and should bring to the
front an entirely new class of stu
dents from those who participate in
other contests. By them our stu
dent body will be put to a test that
will in a measure be an index of
how far we have attained here at
Stanford to one of the main ideals
of a modern universityâ€”to develop
men and women who can reach
practical and scholarly conclusions
on affairs of every-day concern.
