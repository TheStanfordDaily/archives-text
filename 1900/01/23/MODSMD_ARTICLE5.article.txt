# ELECTRIC LIGHTING.
## New System to Be Extended to the Campus on February First. 
### 
The new library was lighted for
the first time last evening. Incan
descenis at the desks were the only
ones burning, as the power is not
at present sufficient to supply all
the lights. This will be remedied
in a few days, when the current
lighting the Row is cut off. The
Peninsula Light and Power Com
pany are stringing wires in to light
the residence portion of the Uni
versity, and they will give power
until 12 o'clock instead of 10:30, as
formerly. This will give the local
plant a chance to light completely
the library and assembly hall.
Beginning with the Ist of Feb
ruary this new system of lights
will be in perfect running order.
Meters will be placed in all of the
houses lighted instead of the former
plan of charging by the month.
The final rate has not been fully de
cided but it will be about 20 cents
per thousand watt hours, if between
1000 and 5000 watt hours are used
per month. If from 5,000 to 10,000
are used, the rate will be 184 cents.
