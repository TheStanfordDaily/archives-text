# MEMORIAL TO DR. A.G. WARNER.
## Friends and Colleagues of the Dead Professor Pay Tribute to a Truly Great Man. 
### 
Last night memorial services
were held in the chapel for Dr.
Amos Griswold Warner, late head
of the department of Economics
and Sociology in the University.
The touching tributes of recollection
bore eloquent testimony how deeply
his friends at Stanford have felt his
death.
President Jordan first spoke, say
ing : " About fourteen years ago I
was told by one who had attended
a convention of political economists
that the man who was the most
sane, interesting, and human of
them all was the professor of econ
omics in the University of Ne
braska, Dr. Amos G. Warner. It
was largely through this statement
that I was led to investigate his life
and work and to offer him a pro
fessorship, first in the East and
again in the West, thelastof which
he finally accepted. It was through
Dr. Warner's recommendation that
I first came to look up the records
of Dr. Ross and Dr. Howard, so he
had a great deal to do with this in
stitution."
Dr. Jordan introduced Dr. How
ard, who said of Dr. Warner, in
part : " 1 have had an acquaintance
with him extending over a score of
years and must be excused if I give
personal reminiscences.
"Just twenty years ago last Sep
tember there appeared for registra
tion in the University of Nebraska
a farmer's boy from Roca, a village
about eleven miles distant from
there. His clothes were of the se
verest country type. His eye, as
many of you know, constantly gave
a human and somewhat quizzical
light —looking out into the new
world into which he was about to
enter, and of which in more than
usual measure he took possession.
I had just returned from Germany
and for three months was a supply
teacher, and with others felt that a
new power had come among us, as
we learned more and more to appre
ciate his mind. The part which a
young man or a young woman has
to take in academic life in the
making of the institutions which
constitute that life is very import
ant. As he is strong or great in
that life fie is likely to be in the
life beyond. Dr. Warner had a
sense of humor almost unsurpassed,
and was often a leader in college
fun —in true college fun—that kind
which had the joy of gentleness, but
he was never found in that group
whose only claim to academic dis
tinction is good clothes, nor among
those who are eager to imitate evil,
nor among those who in the name
of a college joke or prapk delightto
persecute those who are physically
or mentally weaker than them
selves. He told me that he had re
solved to graduate and then carry
the culture he had obtained into ;i
farmer's life. While yet a graduate
student he received his first call to
public duty. In Baltimore, the
patron of charities in that city
heard of him and the young boy re
ceived an invitation to organize the
charities —the most difficult work

that any man can undertake. The
plough boy of Roca undertook the
work and lie succeeded. And then
came the first call to teach. He
was appointed an associate profes
sor and my colleague, and now
after a few months' teaching came
his second call to public work, to
Washington. The thing which
finally determined his coming to
Stanford was the gift of the Hop
kins Library to this institution.
He was deeply interested in rail
road matters and would build up a
railroad school here which would
be a great activity.
" But was the work of Dr. Warner
left unfinished ? He first organ
ized the Associated Charities, and
then he organized one of the most
important branches of another sci
ence, that of Economic Corpora
tions. But there is something more
than that which is better, and that
is the influence of that good and
true soul which he put forth. One
may compare it in its results to a
diamond cast into the water. Thej
waves of intellectual and moral in
fluence recede further and further,
until they break the uttermost
shores of time. He had knowledge
of man, and of men in all forms
and shapes, which only the wise
can possess. His work led him in
the lowest walks of society, and he
came out of it a master of men.
When one stands in the presence of
that noble and pure soul he cannot
but feel humility. When one con
siders his greatness and his strength
one may have faith and hope for
the man of democracy."
Dr. Edward A. Ross was the next
to speak of Dr. Warner. He said :
" Professor Warner was a most orig
inal man. His was the pioneer
mind. He seemed to have the ca
pacity to relate economics to real
life. He was always on the grow
ing margin of the science, where
something new is to be discovered.
His methods were original and ef
fective. Instead of sending his
students to texts, he sent them out
in the world to study the jails,
almshouses, and city halls. Stu
dents who are here now simply can
not realize the deep devotion of
Professor Warner's students to him,
and the profound impression that
he has left on every one of them.
I Te had a rare common sense. When
he was here two years ago he gave
four lay sermons, and I think that
they will never be forgotten. I
have hardly heard a person com
ment on these sermons. They are
of the kind that you think over,
and carry in your mind."
Following Dr. Ross, Mrs. M. R.
Smith sang the " Allah " of Chad
wick, and then Prof. Charles M.
Little spoke, in part, saying; "I
cannot make to live again the
Hashes of humor which lit up many
of the subjects of which Dr. War
ner chanced to speak. Others have
spoken of the justness of his judg
ments. To me he was the same
man always. One did not need to
know him to find out the charm of
his nature. He was modest. In
spite of his great successes his work
seemed to him to fall short of his
high ideals, and he was otten un
satisfied."
Next Mrs. Smith spoke: " After
all, the relations of a man toward

women and children test accurately
his life. His two griefs he had in
dying had nothing to do with the
work he left unfinished, but they
were that his wife should have to
do the work of two without his
help, and that his children should
be without a father."
Mrs. Smith closed the ceremonies
by singing "The Lord is My Shep
herd," from Dvorak.
