It has become customary for the
members of Encina Club to receive
the men of the University sometime
early in the second semester of each
year. The life led by the different
men in any community is so differ
ent that there is often little sym
pathy between them, and the
opportunity for all the men of the
University to meet together for an
evening of enjoyment should not be

lost. We hear bo much about the
broadening influence of college life
that we often forget the possibility
of any narrowing influence. On
this evening of the year the club
does all in its power to make
the time enjoyable. The num
bers on the program are always
ones which we have not the oppor
tunity of enjoying at any other
social event of the year. The re
ception is unique among our list of
social events, and Stanford men are
to be congratulated upon the oppor
tunity for thus assembling together.
