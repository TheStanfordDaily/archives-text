It may not be realized by the
freshmen, but it is nevertheless a
fact, that the contests in which the
athletic teams of the first year class
compete with outside teams are in
tercollegiate events, and that the
teams represent Stanford and not
their class. Such a contest is that
which it is becoming customary to
hold between the track team of the
University of Nevada and our
freshman team. So it seems that
the honor of Stanford should move
the freshmen to do their best to
send a strong, at least a creditable,
team to Reno in the spring, even if
class spirit and the prospect of the
best trip of the year had no effect.
Although no more than ten men
can go on the trip there are at pres
ent not enough, good, bad or indif
ferent, training for the field-day
with Nevada to make a team of half
that number. In four events there
is not a candidate, and in none is
there more than one man training.
The track manager has done his
best to induce men to appear on
the oval, but he is rewarded with
promises of " next week." Our re
lations with the University of Ne
vada have always been most cor
dial. This year when casting about
for competitors they gave Stanford
the preference. The track manage
ment favors the meet, the student
body desires it, but there can be no
field-day if the freshmen have no
team to send. There is plenty of
good material in the Class of '03,
and if the meet does not occur they
must bear the opprobrium of every
other Stanford man for their indif
ference.
