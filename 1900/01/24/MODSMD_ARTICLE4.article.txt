Several track meets with outside
teams have been announced by C.
A. Cantwell, '01, this year's track
manager. The season will prob
ably be opened with the University
handicap field-day, which will be
held about the first of March. This
field-day is held on our track every
year to give the men experience
and to try out the men.
Following the University Handi
cap, a meet will be held between
the Freshman team and some one
of the high schools. Then, some
time about the Easter vacation, the
Freshman team will be taken to
Reno for a meet with the Univer
sity of Nevada. Manager Gault of
Nevada has proposed to the track
management that a return should
be held between Nevada and one of
our class teams late in the season,
but nothing definite has been de
cided upon as yet.
The University will enter a team
in the indoor meet of the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association, to be
held in San Francisco. A team
composed of the best two men in
each school in the Academic League
will compete against teams entered
by Berkeley, Stanford, the San
Francisco Y. M. C. A., Olympics,
and Reliance. The meet will be
held to decide the Coast champion
ship.
The Intercollegiate field-day will
close the season late in April. The
date has not yet been fixed, but
will be soon. Proposals have been
received from the Univeritv of Or
egon and from Pomona College, but
it is doubtful whether they can be
accommodated.
