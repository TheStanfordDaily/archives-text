In addition to the two prize com
petitions commented on in these
columns yesterday, there are two
others that may well be called to
the attention of the students. Of
these, the one that is probably of
most interest to Stanford people is
that announced by an eastern law
publishing firm. This, of course, is
open only to law students, but
there are so many of these here that
the competition in the contest
should be keen and interesting.
The prize offered is a handsome and
valuable one, and the winner will
be coveted its possession. We print
again today, in another column,
the notice of this contest. The
other contest to which we wish to
call attention, is opened at the in
stance of the American Humane
Association, and has to do with
original essays on vivisection.
