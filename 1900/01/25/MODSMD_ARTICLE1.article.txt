# CLASS OFFICERS ELECTED.
## Juniors and Sophomores Hold Their Regular Semi-Annual Elections.

The 1901 Class election, which
took place today, drew a much
larger vote than usual. This was
largely due to the fact that polls
were kept open for 'several hours
instead of simply holding a class
meeting. Polls were open from 12
to 2 p.m., and the election was un
der the charge of C. A. Cantwell, L.
Ferrari, P. K. Oilman, 11. 0. Fos
ter, T. J. Hoover, and O. L. Sobey.
The only contest was for the
office of president, the contestants
being N.G. Symonds, Eugene War
ren, and C. J. Swindells. A total
of 149 votes was cast, of which
Symonds received 84, Warren 30,
and Swindells 85. Symor.ds was
elected by a majority of 19 votes
over the other two contestants.
The remaining class officers who
were elected without opposition are
as follows: Vice-president, J. A.
Bentley; secretary, A. B. Lemmon;
treasurer, F. I). Hamilton; class
historian, Miss Winifred Morgan;
track manager, C. A. Cantwell;
