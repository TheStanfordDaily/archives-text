Almost two yeaks have passed
since the enlistment of Stanford's
volunteer soldiers in the Spanish
war, yet nothing has been even so
much as begun looking toward a
memorial to them. Many of the
eastern universities with records
less proud than our own have set
up monuments to the memories of
their volunteers; at Yale and Penn
sylvania, notably, are elaborate
memorial gateways, a token of the
gratitude of these universities, and
a token to future collegiate gener
ations that these schools gave forth
their lives at the summons of the
flag. Shall we do less than they
have done ? Shall we do nothing
at all ? It is true that we lost
only a few of our men, but it is
equally true that not one of
those who marched away could
know that he would ever see the
quadrangle again. Their acts were
no less meritorious because they
have lived to return. The memorial
is not for them, it is for the univer
sity, for a glorious tradition of her
early years. A plain tablet of
bronze, a stone within the quad
rangle, or even a. plate within the

library would serve, and for these
the expense would be small. Doc
tor Jordan is known to favor the
plan; let something be done at once.
