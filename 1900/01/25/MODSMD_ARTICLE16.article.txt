Whether basket-ball remains
as one of the games for the women
students here, depends to a great
extent upon the interest taken in
the interclass games this spring.
Since the faculty's decision prohib
iting intercollegiate contests and
contests on other than the home
court, the hope of the game here
rests upon the interclass games. It
is true that the incentive to make
the team is not so great when there
is no chance for an intercollegiate
contest, nor can the teams now get
wildly enthusiastic over playing
for a class trophy. But if sufficient
interest can be worked up this
spring to carry through success
fully a series of class games, a
good start will be made. Interest
in the game is bound to grow, and
in time interclass basket-ball here
will hold the place it does in the
women's colleges of the East.
There no intercollegiate contests,
except mere exhibition games, are
allowed, but games between the
classes are encouraged, and there is
the keenest rivalry among the va
rious teams. There are a number
of good strong players at Stanford
now, who are doing their best to
keep the interest in the game alive,
and if all who play will work to
gether, a successful series of inter
class contests can be carried
through, establishing a precedent
in which interest is bound to grow
every year.
