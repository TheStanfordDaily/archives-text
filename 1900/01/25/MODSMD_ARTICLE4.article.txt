The business of this session was
the consideration of the intercol
legiate agreement, which was taken

up section by section. In this dis
cussion was briefly considered the
points relating to the elegibility of
contestants. The time for holding
intercollegiate contests was also
talked ever.
One of the most important
points of the whole meeting was
the discussion concerning the status
of Freshman players relative to the
annual intercollegiate Freshman
contest. It was recommended as a
revision of the inter collegiate
argeement: 1. That the contest
ants shall have entered the Univer
sity no earlier than the semester
preceding the contest; 2. That
having once been eligible to a
Freshman contest, they shall be
eligible to no Freshman contest
thereafter; 8. Those coming from
Eastern coleges, who have been eli
gible to the Freshman team of their
own college, shall not be eligible to
the Freshman team here.
Another important point was re
lating to the enumeration of field
day events in a certain order, which
shall stand as the established or
der, rather than the fluctuating,
hap-hazard order that confronts us
every year.
The Stanford members of the In
tercollegiate Athletic Committee
will meet in joint session with the
members of that committee from
Berkeley next Saturday in San
Francisco, at which meeting these
points will be again discussed.
