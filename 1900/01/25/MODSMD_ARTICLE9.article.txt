# Tennis Outlook for the Season.
## 
### 
Tennis Manager Hardy, when
seen this afternoon, said that the
outlook for Stanford tennis this
year was fair. Stanford is fortu
nate in having Harry Weihe,
interscholastic champion of Cal
ifornia. Berkeley had expected
to take an easy victory in the
doubles with Sumner Hardy and
Brawley, who entered from an
Eastern college with Junior stand
ing. Besides Weihe, Roth, Watt,
and Lieb put up good games, and

should give Hardy and VVeihe stiff
practice.
The courts will be put in condi
tion, and the grass kept cut around
the back lines. This will be greatly
appreciated by those who have at
tempted to play this semester.
A preliminary tournament will
be held early in March to decide
who will represent Stanford in the
intercollegiate match, which will
be held the latter part of April.
After the preliminaries the two
winning men will play together
against practice teams here and
also in San Jose.
Paul Selby, the Berkeley tennis
manager, is taking up subscrip
tions for the building of bituminous
courts in the center of the Berkeley
oval. The plan is to have the In
tercollegiate tennis match played
at Berkeley in connection with the
Intercollegiate field-day. The ob
jection to this is that Berkeley
would play their finals on their
own practice court, thus giving
them an advantage over the Stan
ford team.
