# FIRST GAME OF THE SEASON.
## Fireman's Fund Team Will Play the Varsity on the Campus. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon will give the
baseball fans their first opportunity
to judge of the relative merits of
the candidates for Varsity honors.
The game with the Fireman's Fund
will put the team to a hard test,
but they should win out with Lan
agan in the box throughout the
game. The word is out, however,
that some of the new fry will be
tried out against the hard-hitting
visitors the last part of the game.
Strohn will be at the receiving end
of the Stanford battery. The rest
of the Varsity is very evenly
balanced for this early in the sea
son. The infield is not yet in form,
but they are putting up snappy ball
and covering lots of ground. The
outfield is weakened by the loss of
Murphy in center-field. Coach
Murphy is anxious to see how his
colts will behave under fire. He is
particularly anxious to learn how
they will bat against the deli very of
a pitcher such as Moskimon. The
team wants to win and will try
to please their coach.
Moskimon will do the twirling
for the insurance men. He is not
unknown to Stanford. His work in
the box in the California League
has always been in the first
division. Hammond will catch
Moskimon. He is a league back
stop whose game behind the bat has
put him well up in the list of back
stops on the Pacific Coast. Krug
at third base and Schmeer at short
stop are also league players with
good records. The first. led
the league in batting, while
Schmeer has a greater number
of stolen bases to his credit than
any other player in the league.
The other men on the team are all
well known players. They will
undoubtedly give an exhibition of
fine ball.
The diamond has been putin ex
cellent shape. The game will be
called at 2:30. Goldsworthy and
Swindells will be the umpires. The
line-up will be as follows:
