We are gratified at the success
which has followed our suggestion
for a more systematic method of
holding class elections. The votes
polled under the new method yes
terday and today were far larger
than have heretofore been cast at
class elections, which is due
entirely to the improvement in
method. The precedent having
been established and confirmed by
practice should not be abandoned
in the future.
