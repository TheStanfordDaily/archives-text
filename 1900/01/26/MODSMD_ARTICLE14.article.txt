Heretofore there has always
been a cry raised during the base
ball season to have the games
played on the campus. This sea
son the baseball manager has
heeded this cry and has planned
a schedule which arranges for cam
pus games with but three excep
tions. Two of these dates are re
turn games with the Fireman's
Fund team, and the other excep
tion is the decisive game of the
championship series with Berkeley.
This game will be played on neu
tral ground. Tomorrow's gan e
will give the manager a fair
line on the successful outcome of
this innovation on his part. Being
the first of the season it
should draw a good crowd. Every
thing points to a good fast game of
ball. Let the crowd turn out.
