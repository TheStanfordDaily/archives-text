The facilities for work made
possible by the opening of the new

library and seminary rooms have
already borne fruit in a fresh and
general impulse to study. It
would take long to name the var
ious carefully planned and praise
worthy conveniences of these rooms.
Nevertheless there have been com
plaints made among the Btudents
of two faults which are serious
enough to demand immediate
attention. They are with regard
to the lighting of the study desks
and to the floor. Each of the desks
is provided with an incandescent
light and a green shade which are
hung with immovable attachments.
They are all of the same height
and come above the eyes as one
sits at the desk. In consequence,
the reflection ©112 the shade is not
properly placed and there is no
way by which it can be adjusted.
Injured eyes are sure to result if
this condition continues long, for
all students are compelled to use
the library more or less during the
evening. It is a matter which,
while a small part of the whole
system, may produce a general and
inestimable injury if allowed to go
on. The other matter regarding
which complaint has been lodged,
that of the cold floors, we think
should also be called to the atten
tion of the proper authorities.
Students are saying on all sides
that it is impossible to keep warm,
in spite of the fact that the atmos
phere in the rooms is all that could
be desired. We mertion these
facts, not in a spirit of condemna
tion, but with the hope of perform
ing one of the functions of the col
lege paper, to reflect student opin
ion.
