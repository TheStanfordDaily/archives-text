# ATHLETIC RECOMMENDATIONS.
## Intercollegiate Committees in Joint Session Submit Radical Changes for Student Approval. 
### 
The Intercollegiate Athletic Com
mittee met Saturday afternoon at
the University Club in San Fran
cisco. The committee consisted of
Prof. George E. Edwards, Clinton
Miller, '00, and Irwin J. Muma, '00,
representing the University of Cal
ifornia, and D. E. Brown, '97, O. C.
Leiter, '99, and C. A. Cantwell, '01,
representing Stanford. J. P. Bern
hard, '90, was Stanford's alternate.
Although the proposed changes
may seem very radical to some, yet
it must not be forgotten that the
most important of these changes,
those that are the most far reach
ing, have been carefully considered
by faculty, alumni, and under
graduates ever since the days of '95,
but not until now has the time
seemed fully ripe for them to take
form in our athletic policy.
Running through the modifica
tions of the intercollegiate agree
ment are two central thoughts; Ist,
the exact specification and defini
tion of points likely to cause inter
collegiate disputes; 2d, the adoption
of changes suggested by experience,
which will place intercollegiate ath
letics on a purer and sounder basis.
The following gives the important
changes made in the agreement,
classified according to the main
divisions into which the agreement
was cast for the purposes of a con
venient codification.
ARTICLE I. â€”CONTESTS.
This article specifies the branches
of athletics in which the two uni
versities shall annually compete.
No new contests were added. The
University of California proposed
an intercollegiate rowing contest,
which was not accepted by the Stan
ford representatives, the latter not
denying, however, that such a con
test would be desirable if conditions
at Stanford permitted it. The ad
dition of the relay-race to the list
of intercollegiate events was dis
cussed favorably, but in connection
with the dropping of the mile walk
no agreement was reached, as the
collegiate policies of the representa
tives could not be reconciled.
The following order of events for
the intercollegiate field-day was
prescribed in order to avoid the an
nual difficulties of arranging a sat
isfactory order when the merits of
each team have become apparent
and the events each athlete will
enter has been determined upon.

100-yard dash (trial heats).
880-yard run.
