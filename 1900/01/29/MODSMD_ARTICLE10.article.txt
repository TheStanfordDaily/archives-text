# VARSITY DEFEATED.
## First Practice Game of the Season Brings Victory to the Fireman's Fund. 
### 
The Varsity opened up the base
ball season by going down before
the Fireman's Fund team with a
score of 8 to 2. Although the game
was lost, there is no blame to be
laid upon the team. For the first
try-out together they played good
ball. Lanagan's work in the box
was fine. He had control and
as much speed as ever. Saturday
he sized up his batters and played
their weak points to the advantage
of his own team better than at any
time last year. Even at this early
date it is safe to predict that Jim
will pitch better than he did last
year.
The infield, with the exception of
Bentley on first, played good ball.
Their fielding was sharp, and
throwing sure and fast. The out
field did not have much to do, but
the little thing they did have to do
they did well.
The Fireman's Fund team put
up a fine article of ball. Their
game in the field was of a high
class; several times the in-field cut
off hits and threw the runner out
at first.
The features of the game were
the fine pitching of Lanagan, Cow
den's three-bagger which scored
Lougheed, and Dunn's two drives
for three bags each time which
netted the visitors five runs.
The summary of the score was
as follows:
