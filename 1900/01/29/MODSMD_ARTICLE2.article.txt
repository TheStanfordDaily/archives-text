# ARTICLE II. ELIGIBILITY OF CONTESTANTS.
## 
### 
Under this article the committee
incorporated a definition of the
status of an amateur adopted from
the generally accepted definition of
the A. A. U.
The qualifications of special and
limited students were more care
fully defined. No regular student
carrying less than ten hours is el
igible for competition, instead of
five, as formerly. Special students,
in addition to carrying ten hours
of University work, must have been
students for one semester previous
to competition. This rule was de
signed to prevent irregularities
and inconsistencies in the present
system, especially in regard to the
securing of advanced credit by spe
cial students solely to be eligible
for contests.
Theclause relating to late registra
tion, by which a student registering
thirty days after the opening of the
University was made eligible, was
amended so that difficulties as to
the date of reckoning the time
might be avoided. The new clause
makes ineligible students register
ing after twenty-five days from the
actual day of the beginning of in
struction at their respective univer
sities.
An important clause was added,
to the effect that no person drawing
a salary by university appointment
other than manual may compete.
In addition, no student drawing a
regular fixed salary from the stu
dent body may be eligible for any
contest. These provisions go into
effect July 1, 1900.
As to the eligibility of candidates
for the Freshman team,'the follow
ing was adopted : No student shall
be eligible to play on any intercol
legiate Freshman team who has
been previously eligible to such a
team in any university of standing.
This will bar out students entering
with advanced standing from other
colleges whether such credit has
been received or not.
ARTICLE 111. —LISTS OF CONTESTANTS.
The manner of exchange of the
lists was specified according to the
recommendation of the faculty ath
letic committees. Lists will be ex
changed three weeks before the con
test, and the exact procedure to be
followed is fixed so that all dis
putes can easily be settled. Pro
tests are to be made solely on the
question of amateur standing, and
specific charges must be filed in
every case. The decision of pro
tests is left to the faculty athletic
committee. Those whose names are
not on the final list will not be al
lowed to compete.

manager; Miss Clara L. Martin,

These changes are now in the hands
of this committee to ratify or re
ject.
Under this article the committee
incorporated a definition of the
status of an amateur adopted from
the generally accepted definition of
the A. A. U.
The qualifications of special and
limited students were more care
fully defined. No regular student
carrying less than ten hours is el
igible for competition, instead of
five, as formerly. Special students,
in addition to carrying ten hours
of University work, must have been
students for one semester previous
to competition. This rule was de
signed to prevent irregularities
and inconsistencies in the present
system, especially in regard to the
securing of advanced credit by spe
cial students solely to be eligible
for contests.
Theclause relating to late registra
tion, by which a student registering
thirty days after the opening of the
University was made eligible, was
amended so that difficulties as to
the date of reckoning the time
might be avoided. The new clause
makes ineligible students register
ing after twenty-five days from the
actual day of the beginning of in
struction at their respective univer
sities.
An important clause was added,
to the effect that no person drawing
a salary by university appointment
other than manual may compete.
In addition, no student drawing a
regular fixed salary from the stu
dent body may be eligible for any
contest. These provisions go into
effect July 1, 1900.
As to the eligibility of candidates
for the Freshman team,'the follow
ing was adopted : No student shall
be eligible to play on any intercol
legiate Freshman team who has
been previously eligible to such a
team in any university of standing.
This will bar out students entering
with advanced standing from other
colleges whether such credit has
been received or not.
ARTICLE 111. —LISTS OF CONTESTANTS.
The manner of exchange of the
lists was specified according to the
recommendation of the faculty ath
letic committees. Lists will be ex
changed three weeks before the con
test, and the exact procedure to be
followed is fixed so that all dis
putes can easily be settled. Pro
tests are to be made solely on the
question of amateur standing, and
specific charges must be filed in
every case. The decision of pro
tests is left to the faculty athletic
committee. Those whose names are
not on the final list will not be al
lowed to compete.
ARTICLE IV. TIME AND PLACE OF
CONTESTS.
Under this article the following
important changes were adopted :
First, after 1900 the annual football
game shall be held on the second
Saturday in November; second,
after 1900 all intercollegiate con
tests shall be held on college
grounds ; third, the intercollegiate
athletic committee at its annual
meeting shall fix the dates for
other athletic contests than football;
fourth, the field-day of 1900 shall
be held on the Stanford campus
upon the third Saturday in April

(April 21st), and the field-day
thereafter shall be held upon that
date alternately on each college
campus. The deciding game of
baseball shall be held on the cam
pus of the university on which the
field-day is not held. The annual
tennis tournament shall be held on
the same campus as the intercol
legiate field-day, and upon the same
day.
ARTICLE V. —COACHES.
. As to coaches the following was
adopted: After 1900 the head coach
shall be a graduate of the univer
sity at which the coaching is done,
llis expenses, including loss of sal
ary and business, may be paid,
but in no case shall the amount ex
ceed $1,500. The head coach may
be assisted by other coaches not
necessarily graduates but in no case
shall the expenses exceed $500.
ARTICLE VI. DURATION OF AGREE
MENT.
This article provides that this
agreement shall continue in effect
until Dec. 31, 1904, and shall go
into effect immediately upon ratifi
cation by the athletic committees
of each university. The agreement
may be amended by joint action at
the annual meeting ef the intercol
legiate athletic committee, which is
fixed to be held between January
15th and 31st.
