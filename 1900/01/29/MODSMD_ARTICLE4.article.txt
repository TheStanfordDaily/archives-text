members of the Glee Club, sang the
hymn, " Come, Sing with Holy
Gladness," and they were followed
by the Rev. C. R. Brown of Oak
land, who read the 95th Psalm.
The choir sang, "Oh, Lord of
Hosts," and after Mr. Parsons had
offered prayer, the corner-stone was

Hail," by the choir and audience,
and a benediction by Mr. Parsons
closed the ceremonies.
