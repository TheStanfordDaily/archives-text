Theke should be some effort
made by those who expect to attend
the Carnot debate at Berkeley on
February 9th to organize singing
and cheering for Stanford. When
ever Berkeley contingents have
come to Palo Alto to back up their
debaters they have come well pre
pared to make an impression, which
they have always done. In justice
to ourselves we can but do the same
now that we are to go to Berkeley
to help our three men bring home
a Cardinal victory. The Execu
tive Committe of the Inter-Society
Debating League is, we presume,
the proper body to attend to this
matter, and we call it to their at
tention with the hope that some
thing will be done.
