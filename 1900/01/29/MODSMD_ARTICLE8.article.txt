In tiie years '94, '95, '96, and
'97, the annual show given by
Sword and Sandals was a well es
tablished and much enjoyed affair
in university life. Their plays
were well attended and much ap
preciated. Sword and Sandals
prospered and was a live society.
It did what it was organized to do
—gave a show every year and cre
ated interest in student attempts
at dramatic art. Since they gave
"She Stoops to Conquer," in the
spring of '97, Sword and Sandals
has gone back until at the present
time they are barely held together
by the yearly election of officers.
It is a decline much to be regretted
for such an organization is a dis
tinct feature in university life and
should be continued. The mem
bers of the society ought to get to
gether and make an effort to put
their organization back in the
place of prominence it once occu
pied.
