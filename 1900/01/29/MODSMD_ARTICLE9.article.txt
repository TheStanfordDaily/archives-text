We print in another column a
full report of the changes in uni
versity athletic arrangements pro

posed by the intercollegiate com
mittees of the University of Califor
nia and Stanford. The questions
thus presented to our student ath
letic committee for determination
in behalf of the whole University
are of vital importance to us all.
It will be some few days before
they will be called upon to decide,
but in the meantime a great deal of j
reflection, not only upon their part,
but upon the part of every student
interested it athletics, will be fully
repaid. Radical innovations in
some respects are proposed; on
other points there is only more de
tailed regulation of what has
always been in vogue. That
changes, more or less radical, are
demanded, is evidenced by the agi
tation on the part of both faculty
and students of both universities,
which has been a constant source
of comment for some time past.
Whether these remedies are the
proper ones it is the duty of our
athletic committee to determine,
Certainly they are the fruit of both
experience and thought and should
be neither adopted nor rejected
without mature consideration from
all parties interested. Students, as
well as members of the committee,
are called upon to form opinions
for it is they, really, who are tak
ing action. The columns of the
Daily Palo Alto, as far as practi
cal, will be open to expressions of
student sentiment.
