## Professor Hudson Talks in the Chapel on "Cash and Credit." 
### 
Professor W. H. 'Hudson deliv
ered an address in the chapel Sun
day morning on the subject, "Cash
and Credit." In part he paid :
" Every now and then, in the litera
ture of the world, we come upon
some memorable expression of the
desire of the natural man to enjoy
to its full the opportunities of the
passing hour. Carpe diem! This
present day, at least, belongs to us.
Why brood on the past ? Let us
eat and drink, then, make the most
of our chance; the night cometh
when no man can enjoy.
"One familiar utterance of this
passionate creed of the present
comes to us from the Sabine Farm,
whence, in words that are wafted
across the ages, and still find an
echo in many a heart, the genial
epicurean poet of the pagan world
enumerates his simple philosophy
of life: ' While the heart is still
heating, and all the senses are
keenly alive, let us twine roses in
our hair, and pass the wine cup
gaily from hand to hand. Yonder
lies the gloomy underworld to which
all pathways tend ; it were vain
and foolish for us, creatures of a
day, to indulge in far-reaching
hopes.'
"The civilization of the world
has all along depended upon a
man's willingness to postpone the
satisfaction of today in favor of the
claims of tomorrow, and to make
adjustments in conduct to remote
and sometimes purely hypothetical
ends. Until this willingness is de
veloped, indeed, and ethical stress
is laid upon it, no progress out of
barbarism is possible. And
throughout all life, as the briefest
consideration will suffice to show,
progress and welfare have been
possible only where men have
gained imaginative power enough
to realize ideally the demands of
the future against the demand of
the present, and sufficient strength
of character to sacrifice without
hesitation the latter to the former.
Apart altogether from the wider
claims of morality, which we are
not now considering, it is evident,
then, that ordinary wisdom in the
management of life, or what we
call enlightened self-interest, must
refuse to accept seriously, or will
accept only in a very modified
form, the ejlfocurean cult of today.
Tomorrow may never be ours, it is
true, but in ordering life we have
to reckon with possibilities and
chances; and so long as tomorrow
is a possibility it is a matter only
of sanity and personal economy to
save some of today's feast against
its coming, instead of gorging our
selves now, and either starving
then or suffering the dire conse
quences of our gluttony.
"Carpe diem! Let us indeed
seize the passing day. Let us take
it as a gift from the gods, full of
divine blessing as well as of divine
opportunity. Let us estimate it to
its utmost value as an occasion of
high endeavor —a chance of noble
living which will never come to us
again. But let us ungrudgingly
lay ourselves open at the same time
to all that it brings us of beauty

and pleasure, to the glory and the
loveliness which we are privileged
to find in its fleeting hours. To let
it pass from us with immediate
duty unaccomplished were wrong;
but wrong, too, to let it pass from
us with its immediate joys unap
preciated and unrealized. ' Write
it in your heart,' says Emerson,
' that every day is the best day of
the year. No man has ever learned
anything rightly until he learns
that every day is doomsday.' Is it
well to postpone the enjoyment of
life until the capacity and the op
portunity of enjoyment have gone
from us forever? We say tomor
row, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
putting off from us, in churlish
spirit, the pleasures that each today
brings with it; and we forget that,
as the Spanish proverb has it, ' It
is by the street of by-and-by that
one reaches the house of never.' It
is thus that duty is left undone;
thus, too, that life's large and gen
erous privileges remain unrealized.
"The thought I would wish to
enforce, then, is that we should take
our pleasure as we go —take it
cheerfully, ungrudgingly, honestly,
heartily, as those who believe that
it is a ' comely fashion to be glad,'
and that it is part of our duty to
find all the happiness we can in
life. Every ethical teacher insists
upon the sinfulness of postponing
the proper duty of the hour. Let
us insist, in our turn, upon the sin
fulness of postponing the proper
pleasure of the hour. It is the
counsel, not of sensualism, but of a
wise philosophy of existence, to
treat happiness, so far as possible,
on the basis of a cash transaction.
" The burden of Omar's song is
that we should live for today. He
tells us that he strikes from the
calendar the unborn tomorrows
and the dead yesterdays. Yet per
haps there is no more solemn or
significant fact in life than this —
that there is no such thing as a
dead yesterday. All the yester
days enter into each today—"all
their thoughts and feelings, all
their desires and aspirations, all
their successes and failures, all
their weaknesses and follies con
verge in this actual moment of
time, making us what we are.
"Completed, happy old age is,
I think, the most beautiful thing
the world has to show; and a com
pleted, happy old age is just the
crown of a well-spent, well-ordered,
cheerful life. And, meanwhile,
happy those who, while still young
and avid of enjoyment, begin so to
live that each day as it passes
forms, as it were, a stone fitly
shaped and polished for the build
ing of the truly happy life."

lay ourselves open at the same time
to all that it brings us of beauty

and pleasure, to the glory and the
loveliness which we are privileged
to find in its fleeting hours. To let
it pass from us with immediate
duty unaccomplished were wrong;
but wrong, too, to let it pass from
us with its immediate joys unap
preciated and unrealized. ' Write
it in your heart,' says Emerson,
' that every day is the best day of
the year. No man has ever learned
anything rightly until he learns
that every day is doomsday.' Is it
well to postpone the enjoyment of
life until the capacity and the op
portunity of enjoyment have gone
from us forever? We say tomor
row, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
putting off from us, in churlish
spirit, the pleasures that each today
brings with it; and we forget that,
as the Spanish proverb has it, ' It
is by the street of by-and-by that
one reaches the house of never.' It
is thus that duty is left undone;
thus, too, that life's large and gen
erous privileges remain unrealized.
"The thought I would wish to
enforce, then, is that we should take
our pleasure as we go —take it
cheerfully, ungrudgingly, honestly,
heartily, as those who believe that
it is a ' comely fashion to be glad,'
and that it is part of our duty to
find all the happiness we can in
life. Every ethical teacher insists
upon the sinfulness of postponing
the proper duty of the hour. Let
us insist, in our turn, upon the sin
fulness of postponing the proper
pleasure of the hour. It is the
counsel, not of sensualism, but of a
wise philosophy of existence, to
treat happiness, so far as possible,
on the basis of a cash transaction.
" The burden of Omar's song is
that we should live for today. He
tells us that he strikes from the
calendar the unborn tomorrows
and the dead yesterdays. Yet per
haps there is no more solemn or
significant fact in life than this —
that there is no such thing as a
dead yesterday. All the yester
days enter into each today—"all
their thoughts and feelings, all
their desires and aspirations, all
their successes and failures, all
their weaknesses and follies con
verge in this actual moment of
time, making us what we are.
"Completed, happy old age is,
I think, the most beautiful thing
the world has to show; and a com
pleted, happy old age is just the
crown of a well-spent, well-ordered,
cheerful life. And, meanwhile,
happy those who, while still young
and avid of enjoyment, begin so to
live that each day as it passes
forms, as it were, a stone fitly
shaped and polished for the build
ing of the truly happy life."
Professor W. H. 'Hudson deliv
ered an address in the chapel Sun
day morning on the subject, "Cash
and Credit." In part he paid :
" Every now and then, in the litera
ture of the world, we come upon
some memorable expression of the
desire of the natural man to enjoy
to its full the opportunities of the
passing hour. Carpe diem! This
present day, at least, belongs to us.
Why brood on the past ? Let us
eat and drink, then, make the most
of our chance; the night cometh
when no man can enjoy.
"One familiar utterance of this
passionate creed of the present
comes to us from the Sabine Farm,
whence, in words that are wafted
across the ages, and still find an
echo in many a heart, the genial
epicurean poet of the pagan world
enumerates his simple philosophy
of life: ' While the heart is still
heating, and all the senses are
keenly alive, let us twine roses in
our hair, and pass the wine cup
gaily from hand to hand. Yonder
lies the gloomy underworld to which
all pathways tend ; it were vain
and foolish for us, creatures of a
day, to indulge in far-reaching
hopes.'
"The civilization of the world
has all along depended upon a
man's willingness to postpone the
satisfaction of today in favor of the
claims of tomorrow, and to make
adjustments in conduct to remote
and sometimes purely hypothetical
ends. Until this willingness is de
veloped, indeed, and ethical stress
is laid upon it, no progress out of
barbarism is possible. And
throughout all life, as the briefest
consideration will suffice to show,
progress and welfare have been
possible only where men have
gained imaginative power enough
to realize ideally the demands of
the future against the demand of
the present, and sufficient strength
of character to sacrifice without
hesitation the latter to the former.
Apart altogether from the wider
claims of morality, which we are
not now considering, it is evident,
then, that ordinary wisdom in the
management of life, or what we
call enlightened self-interest, must
refuse to accept seriously, or will
accept only in a very modified
form, the ejlfocurean cult of today.
Tomorrow may never be ours, it is
true, but in ordering life we have
to reckon with possibilities and
chances; and so long as tomorrow
is a possibility it is a matter only
of sanity and personal economy to
save some of today's feast against
its coming, instead of gorging our
selves now, and either starving
then or suffering the dire conse
quences of our gluttony.
"Carpe diem! Let us indeed
seize the passing day. Let us take
it as a gift from the gods, full of
divine blessing as well as of divine
opportunity. Let us estimate it to
its utmost value as an occasion of
high endeavor —a chance of noble
living which will never come to us
again. But let us ungrudgingly
lay ourselves open at the same time
to all that it brings us of beauty

and pleasure, to the glory and the
loveliness which we are privileged
to find in its fleeting hours. To let
it pass from us with immediate
duty unaccomplished were wrong;
but wrong, too, to let it pass from
