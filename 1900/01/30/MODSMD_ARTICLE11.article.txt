With the intercollegiate field
day to be held on the Stanford
campus, it will l>e necessary for
every Stanford student to co-oper
ate in making the meet a success.
The call for more men on the track
was answered by the addition of
about twenty men to the squad, but
the number is far too small if a
successful team is to be chosen for
the final contest. At present the
team is particularly weak in the
jumps and distances, and unless
more men come out for these events
we cannot hope to make a good
showing. With a competent, coach
and trainer, a good track, and the
advantages of a meet on home
grounds, there should be every in

ducement for any man who has
any athletic ability to appear on
the track daily for regu4ar : V'aining.
