# Gymnasium Work.
## 
### 
There is now a new regulation in
regard to cuts in the men's gymnas
ium. After the four allowed cuts
are taken, a student is allowed to
make up any in excess of that lim
it on Tuesdays and Thursdays. In
the afternoon there are classes on
both of those days for leaders, and
those having cuts are allowed to
make them up then.
As usual, those wishing to play
baseball or to go on the track are
privileged to substitute that work
for the indoor work under the old
regulations. At present there are
nineteen men who are substituting
the outdoor for the indoor work.
