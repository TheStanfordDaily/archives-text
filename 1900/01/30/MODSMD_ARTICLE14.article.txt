# Library Notes.
## 
### 
—Thirty new volumes have been
added recently to the Phelan li
brary.
—Owing to lack of locks on the
doors, the new departmental libra
ries will not be ready for occupancy
until about February 10th. The
Hopkins railroad library is being
rapidly put into shape, and will be
one of the finest libraries on that
subject in the United States.
