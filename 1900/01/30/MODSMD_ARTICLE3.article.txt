## Test of Palo Alto Light Plantâ€”Other News Items. 
### 
A test of the steam engine at the
Palo Alto lighting plant was recent
ly conducted by Prof. G. H. Marx
and a corps of students from the
Mechanical and Electrical Engi
neering departments. The engine
is a Corliss engine built by the Nord
berg Engine Co.of Milwaukee, Wis.
and installed by the Tracy Engi
neering Company of San Fran
cisco.
The object of the test was to de
termine the engine's water rate,
i. e., to determine the weight of
water used per indicated horse
power per hour, and to compare
this rate with the rate guaranteed.
It was found to be 25.41 pounds of
water against 27.5 pounds, the
guaranteed quantity. Incidental
ly the mechanical efficiency was al
so deter mined hut only approximate
ly, because the efficiency of the
generator and exciter were un
known.
The test began at 2:45 o'clock in
the afternoon and extended over
three hours, during which time in
dicator cards, electrical instru
ment readings, and boiler pressures
were taken and recorded about
every eight minutes. The appara
tus for determining the amount of
water used in the boiler consisted
of weighing scales, a barrel in which
the water was weighed, and another
barrel from which the feed-water
drew its supply. Exhaust steam
from the pump was condensed in
a known weight of water and thus
its weight was determined. Waite,
Stephens, and Stowe attended to
this part of the test.
The boilers were fired with red
wood slabs, five-eighths of a cord
being consumed in three hours.
Unfortunately for accurate results
the safety valve opened several
times during the trial. The steam
thus lost was not considered in the
final computations. This loss, how
ever, would tend to make the effi
ciency still higher.
The load at the engine was ob
tained by running the current
without transformer, through a rhe
ostat. This consisted of a wooden
tank, 10x12 inches, and 12 feet long,
and was filled with water in which
a small quantity of washing soda
was dissolved. Wires from the
switchboard were arranged in the
water so as to slide along the tank.
The load was kept practically con
stant by increasing or decreasing
the distance between the plates.
(t. F. Maddock of the Electrical En
gineering department was in charge
of this work.
The indicator diagrams were
taken by Mr. Tracy, who also acted
as the engineer. Professor Marx
took calorimeter readings from a
throttling calorimeter placed on the
steam pipe near the engine, and
had general supervision of the test.
Data of the test are as follows:
Cylinder dimensions, 12x36; en
gine velocity, 90 revolutions per
minute; indicated horse-power,
G5.51 ; load (calculated from the
electrical energy consumed, and the
assumed efficiency of generator and
exciter), 56.00 horse-power; ap
proximate mechanical efficiency of

engine and connections, 86 percent.;
total weight of water evaporated,
5,246 pounds ; U'tal weight of pump
exhaust, 251 pounds ; total weight
of water used by engine, 4,995
pounds.
