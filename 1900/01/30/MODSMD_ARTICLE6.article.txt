# Berkeley's Clubs to Entertain.
## 
### 
It is the intention of the Grad
uate Club and the California Union
of the University of California to
hear, jointly, a paper by Professor
Leuscher on " The University Con
ference for the Consideration of
Higher Degrees," on the afternoon
of the clay of the Carnot debate.
Members of the Stanford faculty,
Stanford Graduate Club, and other
Stanford graduate students, who
are in Berkeley on that day, are
most cordially invited to attend
the meeting, which will probably
take place at 4 p.m. in Stile's Hall.
The clubs will entertain at dinner
on that day all graduate visitors,
and would like to know by Thurs
day the number to plan for. Those
who will accept will leave their
names with (!. F. Wright at the
Bookstore on or before Wednesday.
