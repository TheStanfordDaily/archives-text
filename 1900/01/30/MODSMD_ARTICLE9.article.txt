We print today an invitation
from the Graduate Club of the
University of California to the
faculty and graduates of Stanford
to attend a meeting on the day of
the Carnot debate and a dinner

in the evening. This is a courtesy
to its faculty and alumni which
our University as a whole will ap
preciate, and which cannot fail to
make the day of the debate more
interesting and instructive to those
of our community who are included
in the invitation.
