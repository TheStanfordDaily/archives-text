# PROPOSED REGULATIONS.
## Prominent Members of the Faculty and Student Body Discuss the Athletic Propositions. 
### 
A representative of the Daily
Palo Alto interviewed a number
of the faculty and students today
on the athletic regulations which
have been proposed by the inter
collegiate athletic committees for
ratification by each university.
For the most part the propositions
find favor as a whole, but there are
numerous suggestions of alteration
as to particulars and even a strong
element of practically entire oppo
sition.
Dr. Richardson, chairman of the
faculty committee on athletics,
said: "This new agreement is
purely a student undei taking, in
so far as the faculty of Stanford
are concerned. They made this
move for a new agreement when
they offered to the students the
agreement made shortly after
Thanksgiving Day. In the joint
meeting of the faculty committees
in San Francisco, the question as
to how far the respective commit
tees could enforce the new rulings,
came up. Jt was decided to in
quire of the presidents of the two
universities to see how far the au
thority of the committees extend
ed. This was done. Dr. Jordan
approved of the action of our com
mittee, and the agreement was sub
mitted to the students. President
Wheeler submitted the agreement
to students,who rescinded it. There
we let the matter drop. It is now
taken up in a new form by the stu
dent committees.
"I approve of the present agree
ment as it stands. The graduate
coach for football provision, I think,
is a good thing. It will revive stu
dent interest in the game. The al
lowing of the coach his expenses,
with the possibility of the amount
reaching fifteen hundred dollars, is
not wise. It may bring a coach
who is going in for the gain he will
receive out of it, and not for his
love of his college and athletics.
"The plan for campus games
will work out for good in the end,
although the first shock may be se
vere. The gate receipts will un
doubtedly fall of, but the expenses
will be less also. The one great
objection to campus games at pres
ent is the fact that we are not pre
pared to accommodate the crowd.
We have no grounds and right now
no definite plans for any. The stu
dent committee who have the loca
tion of the training house and ath
letic grounds in charge are, however,
actively engaged on this considera
tion, and I think that by the time
this agreement goes into effect we
could satisfactorily take care of all
the people at a campus game.
"1 am in favor of shortening the
season. It would undoubtedly be
of benefit to the players.
"On the whole, 1 think the agree
ment a good thing. It will begin
the movement which must begin
sooner or later, and it will inau
gurate a policy of permanent im
provement on a campus athletic
field." ,
Professor V. L. Kellogg, mem
ber of the faculty athletic commit
tee, said: "1 favor the agreement.

It is a move in the right direction.
Eastern coaches, 1 do not believe,
are absolutely necessary. Both
colleges start even on this proposi
tion, and it is as fair for one as for
the other. Whether or not campus
games would be wise 1 am not fully
persuaded. I do not think that we
can have campus games for three
or four years to come. At present
we are not at all prepared to give
games on our own ground. We
have no facilities for doing so.
" Playing the game on a Satur
day, instead of Thanksgiving Day,
if the game is played in San Fran
cisco, will not cause the gate re
ceipts to fall off to any great ex
tent."
Professor Reynolds, assistant
football coach last season, is not in
favor of the movement at present.
He said: "The agreement is, i
think, a little in advance of its
time. A few years from now Stan
ford could carry through such an
undertaking. Under present con
ditions I do not think the move
ment will succeed.
" 1 approve of campus games. 1
think they are the true basis upon
which to put college sport. In re
gard to graduate coaches, however,
J am firm in my belief that such a
provision would be unwise. Not
until we have regular games be
tween the East and the West do 1
believe that graduate coaches can
be established. Two years after
an annual schedule with Eastern
colleges has been played, is the
time for such action. To inaugur
ate a system of graduate coaches
would lead to wire-pulling in col
lege politics and among the alumni
that would be fraught with evil
both to the University and our ath
letics."
Dr. Murphy, athletic adviser,
trainer, and coach looks upon the
proposed agreement as a menace to
Stanford athletics. He expressed
himself as follows: "The changes
contemplated are at least five years
ahead of the conditions that call
for them. Campus games at Stan
ford are out of the question at
present. A large enclosed ground
could be arranged for by the time
it goes into effect, but how is Palo
Alto going to take care of the
crowd, granting that the railroad
can get the people here. Outsiders
know of the lack of accommoda
tions and will keep away from the
games. A big decrease in the gate
receipts will follow, which will in
no wise be in proportion to the de
crease in expenses. Under the
present conditions the managers of
Stanford teams do not have too
much money to spend, and with a
marked falling off in the receipts of
the football game the team must
suffer. Stanford is not old enough
to start a system of graduate
coaches. The Middle West cannot
make such a system succeed, and
it is but to be supposed,in the light of
their experience, that Stanford and
Berkeley would fail. Graduate
coaches are not less expensive than
eastern coaches."
Baseball Captain Strohn also
disliked the provisions made. He
said: "1 do not think we can live
up to the requirements and agree
ment called for. Campus games
in football are not practical for

some years to come simply because
experience has proved that it would
be a money-loser to the student
body.
"In baseball, however, the con
siderations are different; in this
branch of college sport it is to the
interest of the college to play cam
pus games. Games in the city do
not pay. I think, however, that
the decisive game should be played
on neutral ground. This is a fair
proposition that works both ways."
Manager Haslacher was strong
in his disapproval of the new rul
ings.
"The whole movement," he said,
"is begun too early. We are too
young to try to institute any such
radical reforms as are outlined in
this present agreement. Graduate
coaches up to date have not proved
successes, and I am of the opinion
that the near future will prove no
exceptions. Graduate coaches
would cause corruption of the
rankest kind. The position of
coach would prove as fruitful a
field to the alumni as a venture
into politics.
" \Ve are too dependent upon the
public to keep our athletics alive,
to think for a moment that we can
give campus games and close a
football season with a cash balance
in our favor. Another and an im
portant consideration too, is the
fact that we are in no wise capable
of handling a crowd on our cam
pus, granting that we got one. Let
us wait until we have the training
house and grounds on which to
give games. Then we will be on a
fine financial basis. Then and not
until then can we indorse the agree
ment."
J. T. Nourse, '00, editor-in-chief
of the Daily Palo Alto last se
mester, and a football player for
several years, favors the regulations
as a whole, being especially favor
able to campus games and the sys
tem of graduate coaches. He is op
posed to a shortening of the sea
son, however, pointing out that the
University of California opens sev
eral weeks earlier in the fall than
does Stanford, and the weather
there is much more favorable to
early training than is ours.
S. P. Hardy, '02, varsity tennis
manager, favors everything pro
posed, excepting the holding of the
intercollegiate football game on the
campus. He does not think the
facilities for accommodating visi
tors here are at present sufficient
for such an undertaking. As re
gards tennis, a tournament on
home grounds would, of course, very
strongly favor the home team. The
regulation would be fair, however,
on account of the alteration each
year.
