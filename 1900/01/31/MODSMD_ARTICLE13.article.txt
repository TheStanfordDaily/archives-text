Baseball practice this week has
been hampered by the wet condi
tion of the grounds. Dr. Murphy
has had the team out, however, put
ting them through batting and out
field practice.
The scheduled game which was
to have been played Saturday has
been postponed. Lanagan is con
fined to his room with the grip and
will not be able to appear on the
field until next week. Dr. Murphy
is trying to work up pitchers to
take Lanagan'a place. Moore and
Lowenthal have been tried and will
be given a chance if they show
ability. Horn, '03, is playing good
ball on first and is the most prom
ising candidate for that position.
Ball, '03, is being tried behind the
bat in order to insure a substitute
should Capt. Strohn be injured.
Cowden, '03, and Lougheed, '00,
hiive also caught and could be sub
stituted for Strohn.
The practice does not show the
improvement in form that should
exist. The men all seem to have
bad arms and have to use them
carefully. The work of the fielders
at present is poor, as the men do
not cover ground enough for their
positions.
