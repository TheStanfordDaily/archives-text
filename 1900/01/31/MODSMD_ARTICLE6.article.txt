We take it that the Athletic
Committee, while an organization
of those who are most competent
from their interest and experience
to decide for the students as a
whole upon such matters, should,
nevertheless, be guided to a great
extent in their action on the pro
positions before them by the public
opinion of the University. To con
vey an idea of what our faculty and
the students who are prominent in
athletic matters think of the pro
posed changes we print in another
column a number of interviews.
Almost invariably some criticism
is made and in several instances
the most important propositions
are believed to be unsuited to
Stanford's present athletic condi
tions. All of this goes to prove the
length of the step which the new
regulations will mean and the re
sponsibility which rests upon the
Athletic Committee in deciding
upon them.
