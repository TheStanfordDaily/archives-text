So fau this season there has been
no suggestion of inter-class base
hall games. There is no need for
reciting the various arguments
which favor class contests, for their
results are well known. We be
lieve nothing can create a more
hearty interest in an intercollegiate
sport than contests here on the

campus between teams from the

interest more players but it
awakens the student body to the
fact that we are in the midst of the
baseball season. If inter-class
games are to be a feature of this
year's program it is time they were
arranged for. Those in authority
should decide definitely upon the
matter. If we are to have them,
arrangements must be made by the
class managers; if not, the students
who are expecting the precedents of
former years to be followed are
entitled to a knowledge of the pro
posed changes.
