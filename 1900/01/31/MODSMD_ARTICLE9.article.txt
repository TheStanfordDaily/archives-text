One of the active participants in
the experimental work of the U. S.
Commission on the Coast is Claud
liutter, who is now working on a
collection of fishes at the zoological
laboratory. liutter, since receiving
his A. M. at (Stanford in '96, has
been engaged in working up the
natural history of the salmon and
endeavoring, by scientific experi
ments, to solve some of the prob
lems which confront the commis
sion in connection with this fish.
For two seasons he was at the Bat
tle Creek hatchery, and during '98-
'99 had charge of an experimental
hatchery of his own,where he made
an exhaustive study of young
salmon.
After a winter spent at the Hop
kins Laboratory at Pacific Grove
in noting the effect of sea-water
upon these fresh-water fish, Mr.
Rutter was sent out last summer
to experiment with the salmon of
the Sacramento River. Accompan
ied by N. B. Schofield, A. B. '95,
A. M. '97, he travelled 2100 miles
by water and land, exploring the
Sacramento and its branches from
the source down, and making mi
nute observations on the life and
habits of the young salmon, the re
sult to be embodied in a report
which has lately been sent to
Washington.
Mr. Rutter, who, by the way,
probably knows more about the sal
mon than any other man living,
was the first scientist to make thor
ough investigations in this field,
and hence the great value of his
work.
