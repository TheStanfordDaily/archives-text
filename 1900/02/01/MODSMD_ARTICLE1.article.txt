# LECTURE ON EDUCATION.
## Dr. Jordan and Professor Cubberley Speak to Those Who Intend to Teach. 
### 
Last evening Dr. Jordan and
Professor Cubberley gave the annual
talk to those who intend to teach.
Professor Cubberly spoke first, on
the subject of "Teaching as a Pro
fession." He began his address
with a brief review of the progress
made in the professions of law,
medicine, and theology, in manual
training, and preparation for politi
cal life and diplomatic services.
Of the recent development in col
lege affairs he spoke as follows:
" Within the past fifteen years
the universities of America have
undertaken a new problem —that
of improving the public school sys
tem and of elevating the profession
of teaching, if'*a} profession it may
as yet be called. The importance
of public education has been recog
nized from the days of the He
brews to our own, but it is only re
cently that the newer conceptions
derived from a study of psychology,
biology, and sociology have begun
to reveal to our people the differ
ence between 'keeping school ' and
teaching —between having pupils
• learn' a thing and proper brain
development. The two old here
sies that teachers were born and
not made, and that anyone could
teach who could discipline and
cover the pages of a text-book,for a
long time constituted all that there
was to the science of education.
"The first university to turn its
attention to the problem and es
tablish permanent work in peda
gogy, with courses open as electives
to students, was the University of
lowa, in 1873. In 1879 the Uni
versity of Michigan followed, and
in 1881 the University of Wiscon
sin joined the other two. In 1896
the Commissioner of Education re
ported thirty-one institutions as
having organized departments for
the professional training of teach
ers, and over one hundred other in -
stitutions of collegiate rank were re
ported as offering courses for the
training of future teachers."
Professor Cubberley then spoke of
three ways in which the universi
ties contributed toward the eleva
tion of the schools of the State —
the diffusion of educational infor
mation, the preparation of profes
sionally-trained secondary teach
ers, and the preparation of profes
sionally-trained educators. He
closed with some advice to those
intending to teach, in regard to the
courses they should take at the
university, and the special lines
upon which they should work.
Dr. Jordan spoke on " Politics in
the Schools," the address which he
delivered at the State Teachers'
Association at Sacramento, He
began with a criticism of the city
governments of the United, States,
showing the corruption of the pres
ent system of party rewards and
payments. In regard to the cor
ruption in public schools he said:
"Thus far most of our cities have
failed lo give the people the school
system which they deserve, which
they pay for, and which is essential
to the best development of their

children. The cause of this failure
lies in the corruption of civic au
thority for the furtherance of indi
vidual ends. In other words, the
school service in most of our cities
is very bad, because the schools are
tampered with and used as tools to
enrich or advance those persons
who have them in charge. This is
what is meant by the common
phrase: 'Our schools are poor be
cause they are in politics.'
" Three elements are necessary in
the administration of public
schools: First, the presence of a
board of control, representing the
people, attending to the finances of
the school, and giving to the pro
motion of its interests a degree of
time and attention which the body
of the people could not give—this
we call the Board of Trustees. Sec
ond, an educational expert, who
shall know schools on the one hand
and teachers on the other, who
shall know educational aims and
ideals, their relative place and val
ue, and the means by which they
may be carried out. Such an edu
cational manager we term the Su
perintendent of Schools. The third
element is, trained and competent
teachers.
"The school board is supposed to
be made up of men of wisdom, dis
cretion, and public spirit, who rep
resent the interests of the people at
large and to whom the manage
ment of the schools can safely be
entrusted. It is the first duty of
these men to associate with them
selves an expert in education, a
superintendent of schools, a man
competent to choose, control, and
dismiss individual teachers, one
who has executive ability, by which
term is meant the power of work
ing out a policy through the agency
of other men and women. When
these relations are normal we al
ways have good schools. Schools
are bad only when they are in the
hands of bad teachers, ignorant,
indifferent, or corrupt.
"When a city election is carried,
it happens sometimes that teachers
do active service for the party. To
these the party managers can offer
places in the schools. The politi
cal bosses order this and the school
board, their creatures, simply reg
ister the decree. Coarse and un
democratic as this may seem, there
are many teachers in our State who
strive in every nerve to become its
beneficiaries.
"The various forms of school
corruptions have a variety of evil
results. These we may analyze as
follows: 1st, they injure the schools
by making good work impossible:
2d, they exclude good teachers;
3d, they exclude those who strive
to rise in the profession by honor
able means; 4th, they render places
in the schools unstable; 5th, cor
rupt conditions keep the best men
out of public school work.
" How shall we escape from the
spoils system ? How shall we free
our schools from personal interfer
ence in the interest of personal
ends? The best way to insure
schools is to secure the best super
intendent possible,and then to give
him full power to choose the teach
ers. By this means and by this
alone is it possible to adopt means

to ends and make the school sys
tem of a city an instrument which
can produce the best results.
"The next best way is to secure
a superintendent through the
means found necessary in the civil
service. This system serves to pick
out fairly good public servants and
to exclude political corruption and
personal pulls.
"Three ways to remedy the evils
of politics in the schools may be
suggested: First, we may appeal
to statutes. • We may tie up the
school board and superintendent
by laws which shall make a polit
ical or personal appointment a
misdemeanor. We may place such
tampering on the judicial level of
embezzlement, where it morally be
longs. The second method is to
educate the community. Let the
people know what good schools
ought to be and how much the
children suffer from being forced
into any other. Third, educate
the teachers. Quite as necessary
as the training of the public is the
bringing of the teachers to higher
standards of professional honor.
Let us individually cease to look
toward pull, intrigue, and favorit
ism, but trust to the goodness of
our records as teachers for advance
ment.
"Eternal vigilance is another
name for civic devotion and moral
awakening. And because the next
generation must be intellectually
and morally the reflex of the
schools of today, reform in educa
tion is the most vital of all re
forms."

ent system of party rewards and
payments. In regard to the cor
ruption in public schools he said:
"Thus far most of our cities have
failed lo give the people the school
system which they deserve, which
they pay for, and which is essential
to the best development of their

children. The cause of this failure
lies in the corruption of civic au
thority for the furtherance of indi
vidual ends. In other words, the
school service in most of our cities
is very bad, because the schools are
tampered with and used as tools to
enrich or advance those persons
who have them in charge. This is
what is meant by the common
phrase: 'Our schools are poor be
cause they are in politics.'
" Three elements are necessary in
the administration of public
schools: First, the presence of a
board of control, representing the
people, attending to the finances of
the school, and giving to the pro
motion of its interests a degree of
time and attention which the body
of the people could not give—this
we call the Board of Trustees. Sec
ond, an educational expert, who
shall know schools on the one hand
and teachers on the other, who
shall know educational aims and
ideals, their relative place and val
ue, and the means by which they
may be carried out. Such an edu
cational manager we term the Su
perintendent of Schools. The third
element is, trained and competent
teachers.
"The school board is supposed to
be made up of men of wisdom, dis
cretion, and public spirit, who rep
resent the interests of the people at
large and to whom the manage
ment of the schools can safely be
entrusted. It is the first duty of
these men to associate with them
selves an expert in education, a
superintendent of schools, a man
competent to choose, control, and
dismiss individual teachers, one
who has executive ability, by which
term is meant the power of work
ing out a policy through the agency
of other men and women. When
these relations are normal we al
ways have good schools. Schools
are bad only when they are in the
hands of bad teachers, ignorant,
indifferent, or corrupt.
"When a city election is carried,
it happens sometimes that teachers
do active service for the party. To
these the party managers can offer
places in the schools. The politi
cal bosses order this and the school
board, their creatures, simply reg
ister the decree. Coarse and un
democratic as this may seem, there
are many teachers in our State who
strive in every nerve to become its
beneficiaries.
"The various forms of school
corruptions have a variety of evil
results. These we may analyze as
follows: 1st, they injure the schools
by making good work impossible:
2d, they exclude good teachers;
3d, they exclude those who strive
to rise in the profession by honor
able means; 4th, they render places
in the schools unstable; 5th, cor
rupt conditions keep the best men
out of public school work.
" How shall we escape from the
spoils system ? How shall we free
our schools from personal interfer
ence in the interest of personal
ends? The best way to insure
schools is to secure the best super
intendent possible,and then to give
him full power to choose the teach
ers. By this means and by this
alone is it possible to adopt means

to ends and make the school sys
tem of a city an instrument which
can produce the best results.
"The next best way is to secure
a superintendent through the
means found necessary in the civil
service. This system serves to pick
out fairly good public servants and
to exclude political corruption and
personal pulls.
"Three ways to remedy the evils
of politics in the schools may be
suggested: First, we may appeal
to statutes. • We may tie up the
school board and superintendent
by laws which shall make a polit
ical or personal appointment a
misdemeanor. We may place such
tampering on the judicial level of
embezzlement, where it morally be
longs. The second method is to
educate the community. Let the
people know what good schools
ought to be and how much the
children suffer from being forced
into any other. Third, educate
the teachers. Quite as necessary
as the training of the public is the
bringing of the teachers to higher
standards of professional honor.
Let us individually cease to look
toward pull, intrigue, and favorit
ism, but trust to the goodness of
our records as teachers for advance
ment.
"Eternal vigilance is another
name for civic devotion and moral
awakening. And because the next
generation must be intellectually
and morally the reflex of the
schools of today, reform in educa
tion is the most vital of all re
forms."
Last evening Dr. Jordan and
Professor Cubberley gave the annual
talk to those who intend to teach.
Professor Cubberly spoke first, on
the subject of "Teaching as a Pro
fession." He began his address
with a brief review of the progress
made in the professions of law,
medicine, and theology, in manual
training, and preparation for politi
cal life and diplomatic services.
Of the recent development in col
lege affairs he spoke as follows:
" Within the past fifteen years
the universities of America have
undertaken a new problem —that
of improving the public school sys
tem and of elevating the profession
of teaching, if'*a} profession it may
as yet be called. The importance
of public education has been recog
nized from the days of the He
brews to our own, but it is only re
cently that the newer conceptions
derived from a study of psychology,
biology, and sociology have begun
to reveal to our people the differ
ence between 'keeping school ' and
teaching —between having pupils
• learn' a thing and proper brain
development. The two old here
sies that teachers were born and
not made, and that anyone could
teach who could discipline and
cover the pages of a text-book,for a
long time constituted all that there
was to the science of education.
"The first university to turn its
attention to the problem and es
tablish permanent work in peda
gogy, with courses open as electives
to students, was the University of
lowa, in 1873. In 1879 the Uni
versity of Michigan followed, and
in 1881 the University of Wiscon
sin joined the other two. In 1896
the Commissioner of Education re
ported thirty-one institutions as
having organized departments for
the professional training of teach
ers, and over one hundred other in -
stitutions of collegiate rank were re
ported as offering courses for the
training of future teachers."
Professor Cubberley then spoke of
three ways in which the universi
ties contributed toward the eleva
tion of the schools of the State —
the diffusion of educational infor
mation, the preparation of profes
sionally-trained secondary teach
ers, and the preparation of profes
sionally-trained educators. He
closed with some advice to those
intending to teach, in regard to the
courses they should take at the
university, and the special lines
upon which they should work.
Dr. Jordan spoke on " Politics in

delivered at the State Teachers'
Association at Sacramento, He
