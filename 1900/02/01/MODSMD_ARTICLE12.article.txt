# Berkeley's Athletic Stand.
## 
### 
The intercollegiate athletic agree
ment drawn up by the representa
tives of California and Stanford in
joint session last Saturday in San
Francisco has been actively opposed
by the University of California
Athletic Committee. This commit
tee met yesterday and amended
three important points: the order
of events in the field-days, the
matter of graduate coaches for the
football team, and the idea of hold
ing the next field-day on the Stan
ford campus.
The matter of the field day was
amended by the committee so that
it would not preclude William
Drum, Berkeley's crack sprinter,
from winning his usual number of
first places, which possibility the
committee feel is impaired by the
new regulations.
As to the second objection, an
amendment was offered that, in
stead of being compelled to gradu
ate, the coach should only need to
have played at least one season on
the team of his college before he
could be qualified.
The last radical step taken by
the committee was to strike out al
together the provision for holding
the next field-day on the Stanford
campus.
