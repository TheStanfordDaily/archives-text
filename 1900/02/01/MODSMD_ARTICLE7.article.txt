The intercollegiate semi-finals
which begin tonight should pack
the chapel. No attempt has been
made to advertise the debaters, and
the student body at large does not
seem to be aware that the debates
are to take place. If we are to
keep up the aroused interest in
debating, it must be done by show
ing that the student body is be
hind the debaters. It is very diffi
cult for a speaker to enthuse to
empty benches. Unless the chapel
is tilled with enthusiastic supporters
the debaters cannot feel that the
student body is behind them.
Everybody who can possibly do so
should make an effort to attend.
