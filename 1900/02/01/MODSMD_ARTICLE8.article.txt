Considerable complaint has
been made by the tennis players of
the University of the lack of atten
tion which has been paid to the
Encina courts. An appropriation
was made last semester by the Ex
ecutive Committee for this purpose
which has not yet been made use
of. Practice, evidently, is impossi
ble during the present weather un
less improvements are made. It is
high time all branches of spring
athletics were being actively ar
ranged for. We do not have such
an abundance of enthusiasm that
we can afford to let any of it go
to waste 011 account of lack of ordi
nary facilities for allowing it to
display itself.
