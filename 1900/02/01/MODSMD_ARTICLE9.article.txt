The report comes that the pro
posed athletic regulations have re
ceived alterations at the hands of
the committee at Berkeley in three
very material points. It is too
early yet to see what will be the
ultimate outcome of the intercolleg
iate committees' propositions, but
it is certain that any permanent
regulations must be bassed upon a
fair spirit of compromise. If either
of the parties to the agreement
stand upon alterations which are

suggested by only a temporary con
dition of affairs, their position can
not but be detrimental to the suc
cess of any intercollegiate arrange
ments. An insistance upon mak
ing a permanent regulation to
favor the chances of a particular
sprinter whose career is about com
pleted, stands upon such a narrow
basis that it cannot hope to meet
with agreement. Such a spirit is
not the kind that will succeed in
making an intercollegiate agree
ment of the greatest value to uni
versity athletics. What is wanted
are regulations of fairness, and
any propositions which display so
openly as these the fact that they
are backed by merely one-sided
arguments are sure to bring noth
ing but injurious results to any
attempts at arrangement.
