The track outlook has improved
some in the last two weeks. A
number of new men have come out
for work, and Dr. Murphy says
that he hopes to till the events. The
team is weak in the jumps and
hammer-throw, but should win
points in the sprints and distances.
In the 100 and 220, Stuart, '01,
Nourse, '00, Cantwell, '01, and Mc-
Cowan, '03, are working to gain
points. Oilman, '01, Smithen, '03,
Talbot, '01, Chadbourne, '02, Har
kins, '00, Hart, '03, and McLaugh
lin, '02, are training for the quar
ter. The distance men are: Bar
ker, '01, Morris, '01, Ferrari, '01,
and Wilson, '01; Strout, '01, Pol
lock, '03, Bowman, '01, and Fisher,
'02, are trying the hurdles. Track
captain Boyd, '00, and Dole, '03,
are the only men who have been
trying the pole-vault. Dole may
develop into a vaulter before field
day. Symonds,'ol, Foster,'ol, Nor
amore, '03, McCullough, '03, are
out for the broad jump, and Dole
and Boyd for the high jump. For
the mile walk, Dutton, '00, Lous
ley, '01, Berwick, '02, and Wright,
'01, are out. Treager, '03, is show
ing up well in the weights, with
Parker, '03, Berwick, '02, Wardall,
'01, and Brooke, '03.
Dr. Murphy has been handi
capped in his work with the track
men, owing to the lack of a " rub
ber.'' Billy McLeod, last year's
trainer, however, has arrived and
will take charge of the rub
bing room. With the systematic
training and instruction Dr. Mur
phy will give the men, they should
be in good training for the field
day, which is to be held on the
Stanford oval.
There will be a preliminary try
out on the third of March, about
five weeks from the coming Satur
day. The meet will be a handicap
affair, the men being placed ac
cording to the work they have
done. The winners in this field
day will be given careful training,
to fit them for the intercollegiate
match.
Dr. Murphy is kept busy in the
morning trying track men, and in
the afternoon be has the baseball
men on his hands. The men who
are working on the diamond are
not in the best of shape. The in
field is fairly well settled with Cap
tain Strohn behind the bat, Horn,
'03, at first, Cowden, '03, on Recond,
Lougheed, '00, at short, and Ed
wards, '01, on third. The work of
the fielders is unsatisfactory.
They do not cover the ground
their work calls for, and a great deal
of time will be spent from now on
in getting the fielding into good
shape. Lowenthal, '03, Havens,
'01, Laurence. '01, Symonds, '01,
Parker, '03, and Young, '02, are
the most promising candidates for
the outfield
Ball, '03, is being tried behind
home to ensure a substitute for
Captain Strohn. Lanagan has
been laid up with the grip for
several days and will probably
be out of the game for
another week. Moore, '03, and
Lowenthal, '03, are being tried in
the box.
