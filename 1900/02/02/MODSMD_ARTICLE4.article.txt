# DEATH COMES PEACEFULLY
## In the Presence of His Father and Student Friends B.C. Baird Passes Away. 
### 
Burgess C. Baird, who has been
critically ill at Encina for the last
two weeks, passed away this morn
ing at seven o'clock. His death
was not unexpected. Everything
which his friends and the physi
cians could do for him was done,
but it was of no avail, and he has
been gradually sinking since last
Wednesday.
For years Baird has been troub
led with an affection of the throat
and lungs. Two weeks ago Thurs
day he was taken ill with conges
tion of the lungs which brought on
hemorrhages, and this rapidly de
veloped into pneumonia. He
passed safely through the crisis,
however, but the disease left him
in a very weak condition. The old
trouble with his lungs returned, de
veloping into consumption. It was
hoped that he would recover suffic
iently to take him South, but he
grew worse so rapidly that all
thought of this was given up early
this week.
Baird has been at Stanford only
since last September, but in that
time he has made many warm
friends. He entered here with
junior standing from the Ohio
University at Columbus, and was
a major in the Law department.
His home was in Troy, Ohio, where
he graduated from the high school
in '97. He was a Master Mason in
the Masonic lodge, having joined
soon after he became twenty-one
years old.
Everyone who knew the dead
student liked him, and the profes
sors in the Law department speak
in the highest terms of his work as
a student. It was really his devo
tion to his studies and his hard
work last semester which weakened
his constitution so that he was un
able to rally after his last illness.
M. E. Baird, the dead man's fa
ther, came out here last week and
was with his son till the last. He
will take the body East for inter
ment.
The following resolutions were
passed this afternoon by the men
in whose classes Baird was regis
tered :
We, the undersigned, who were
instructors under whom Mr. Bur
gess C. Baird was working while in
the University, desire heartily to
express our sorrow at his untimely
death and sympathy with his
father and other relatives. In Mr.
Baird's death the University has
lost an earnest worker and an able
student.
