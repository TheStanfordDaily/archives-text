When such an important sub
ject as the permanent regulation of
intercollegiate athletics in Califor
nia was to be considered, it would
seem that something like a full
attendance might be expected from
the Athletic Committee. Although
there are sixteen regular and ex
officio members of that body, but
nine were present at last night's
meeting. The students have given
the power to act for them to com
mittees, and committee men in ac
cepting their positions are fully
aware of the responsibilities thereby
assumed. Any disposition to shirk
or put the burden of decision upon
others, either intentionally or
through mere indifference, very
justly deserves the criticism vyhich
it receives.
