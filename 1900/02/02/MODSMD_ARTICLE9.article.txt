Nothing is sadder than to see
a life full of hope and promise cut
short just as it is beginning to de
velop into one of power and
usefulness. The death of Burgees
Clay Baird, this morning, was a
case of that kind. The University
grieves with his father in his great
loss. Baird entered the University
only last fall but had already
gained a host of friends and was
respected and esteemed by all ac
quainted with him. His health
broke down at Ohio State Univer
sity and he came out here hoping
that the milder climate would
soon bring about an entire recovery.
His ambition, however, would not
permit him to lighten his work.
He did not seem so very ill, and
some of those who knew him best
were surprised when the final crash
came. No doubt he had small ap
preciation of his own danger and
so was led to attempt more than
he should have done. Perhaps it
would not be out of place to notice
a lesson which this sad occurrence

should teach to all who, like Baird,
come to California for health.
Climate may do much but it is not
likely that it will be able to accom
plish anything if the one seeking
its aid will not also remove all ob
stacles by compelling himself to
cease severe work and to lead in a
large measure an out-door life.
