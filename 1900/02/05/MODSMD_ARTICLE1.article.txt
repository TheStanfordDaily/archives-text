# SEMI-FINAL DEBATES.
## Result of the Contests Held Saturday Night in the Chapel. 
### 
As a result of the intercollegiate
semi-finals held in the chapel
Friday and Saturday evenings,
nine debaters were chosen who,
with J. F. English C. M. Mar
rack, and J. E. Springer,
will compete in the finals
early in March. Those winning
places were E. D. Holly, '00, W. H.
Morris, '01, C. D. Scott, '02, A. J.
Copp, '02, Miss Anna Fraser, '00,
C. F. Riddel 1, '01, F. B. Wagner,
'03, Charles Quayle, '00, and A. N.
Merritt, '03. Professor Davidson
presided, and the judges were Pro
fessors Whittier and Green, and
Registrar Elliott.
The first debate was on the ques
tion, "Resolved, That Cuba should
not be given Independence." A. L.
Walker, '03, leader for the affirma
tive, contended that Cuba's beet
interests demand American control.
M. C. Decarli, '00, for the nega
tive, maintained that independence
will help Cuba more than any im
posed government.
R. J. Sterrett, '02, second speaker
on the affirmative, argued that it
was our duty to give Cuba a strong
and responsible government.
C. L. Asmussen, '01, for the nega
tive, asserted that the purpose of
the Spanish was not conquest, and
that the United States should set
the world a moral example.
The question for the second de
bate was "Resolved, That in the
United States, Suffrage with an
Education Qualification is Prefera
ble to Universal Suffrage."
L. E. Harter, '01, led for the
affirmative, arguing that universal
suffrage is incompatible with dem
ocracy.
W. A. Morris, '01, for the nega
tive, held that the principles of
equality and sound government
demand universal suffrage.
L. H. Roseberry, '02, second on
the affirmative, maintained that
an educational qualification would
purify politics and stimulate edu
cation.
J. A. Koontz, '02, second nega
tive, said that corruption lies not
in the voters, but in the party
leaders, and hence the futility of
the proposed qualification.
J. J. Ryan, '03, for the affirma
tive, argued that educational qual
ification will make the ballot worth
something.
A. J. Copp, '02, the third sup
porter of the negative, questioned
the wisdom of such a qualification.
Mere ability to read and write does
not mean sagacity and judgment
in vote-casting. Blame rests with
the bosses, not with the illiterates.
"Resolved, That England's Policy
in South Africa is Justifiable," was
the question of the third debate.
E. 1). Holly, '00, for the affirma
tive, argued that the whole matter
is a question of civilization, the
progress of which is retarded by
Boer methods.
W. L. Lewis, '00, supporting the
negative, contended that the Eng
lish, as aliens, should submit to
Boer laws.
11. W. Grunsky, '00, closed for
the affirmative, showing that the

English in Africa had brought the
Transvaal prosperity, and were
legally and morally justified in
their demands.
The first debate of Saturday
evening was on the question, "Re
solved, That the American congres
sional system is better adapted to
the American people than the En
glish parliamentary system."
C. D. McComish, '03, opened for
the affirmative, arguing that the
English system concentrates abnor
mal power in the hands of a few
men.
H. N. Merritt, '03, for the nega
tive, claimed for the parliamentary
system advantages in economy, sta
bility, and responsibility.
C. 1). Scott, '02, contended that in
England there is no real democracy
—there it is the ministers who are
powerful, here the people.
F. J. Cummings, '01, for the neg
ative, pointed out the evils of our
committee system. Legislators are
not directly responsible for their
acts.
H. C. Jones, '02, for the affirma
tive, pictured the effect on America
of a parliamentary system.
W. J. Wood,'ol, for the negative,
contended that the English system
is more democratic.
Mies Anna Fraser, '00, for the
affirmative, defended the committee
system as a cheek on hasty legisla
tion. It is civil service reform we
need, not a change in government.
Miss Stewart, '00, for the nega
tive, said that the English system
would be more economical and pro
ductive of better administration
than our own.
F. E. Nangle, '03, closing for the
affirmative, argued that the Amer
ican people could not endure the
restraint of the English system. In
England the popular voice is never
heard.
The second debate, " Resolved,
That the enfranchisement of the
negro was expedient," was opened
by E. W. Rice, '02, for the affirm
ative. He asserted that enfran
chisement was the only logical
course. It benefited both negro
and white.
B. P. Crow, '02, for the negative,
claimed that enfranchisement of
whites alone would have been a bet
ter method. The negro was not lit
to become a citizen.
F. B. Wagner, '03, for the affirm
ative, believed that enfranchise
ment has benefited the white man,
and given ambition to the negro.
Charles Quayle, '00, for the nega
tive, dwelt on the evil consequences
of enfranchisement. Crime goes
unpunished and state debts increase
where blacks ;ire in majority.
C. F. Riddel 1, '01, closing for the
affirmative, spoke of enfranchise
ment as justified by results. Since
the war negroes have made greater
progress than whites. Their legisla
tion is wise, and they make good
citizens.

M. C. Decarli, '00, for the nega
tive, maintained that independence
will help Cuba more than any im
posed government.
R. J. Sterrett, '02, second speaker
on the affirmative, argued that it
was our duty to give Cuba a strong
and responsible government.
C. L. Asmussen, '01, for the nega
tive, asserted that the purpose of
the Spanish was not conquest, and
that the United States should set
the world a moral example.
The question for the second de
bate was "Resolved, That in the
United States, Suffrage with an
Education Qualification is Prefera
ble to Universal Suffrage."
L. E. Harter, '01, led for the
affirmative, arguing that universal
suffrage is incompatible with dem
ocracy.
W. A. Morris, '01, for the nega
tive, held that the principles of
equality and sound government
demand universal suffrage.
L. H. Roseberry, '02, second on
the affirmative, maintained that
an educational qualification would
purify politics and stimulate edu
cation.
J. A. Koontz, '02, second nega
tive, said that corruption lies not
in the voters, but in the party
leaders, and hence the futility of
the proposed qualification.
J. J. Ryan, '03, for the affirma
tive, argued that educational qual
ification will make the ballot worth
something.
A. J. Copp, '02, the third sup
porter of the negative, questioned
the wisdom of such a qualification.
Mere ability to read and write does
not mean sagacity and judgment
in vote-casting. Blame rests with
the bosses, not with the illiterates.
"Resolved, That England's Policy
in South Africa is Justifiable," was
the question of the third debate.
E. 1). Holly, '00, for the affirma
tive, argued that the whole matter
is a question of civilization, the
progress of which is retarded by
Boer methods.
W. L. Lewis, '00, supporting the
negative, contended that the Eng
lish, as aliens, should submit to
Boer laws.
11. W. Grunsky, '00, closed for
the affirmative, showing that the

English in Africa had brought the
Transvaal prosperity, and were
legally and morally justified in
their demands.
The first debate of Saturday
evening was on the question, "Re
solved, That the American congres
sional system is better adapted to
the American people than the En
glish parliamentary system."
C. D. McComish, '03, opened for
the affirmative, arguing that the
English system concentrates abnor
mal power in the hands of a few
men.
H. N. Merritt, '03, for the nega
tive, claimed for the parliamentary
system advantages in economy, sta
bility, and responsibility.
C. 1). Scott, '02, contended that in
England there is no real democracy
—there it is the ministers who are
powerful, here the people.
F. J. Cummings, '01, for the neg
ative, pointed out the evils of our
committee system. Legislators are
not directly responsible for their
acts.
H. C. Jones, '02, for the affirma
tive, pictured the effect on America
of a parliamentary system.
W. J. Wood,'ol, for the negative,
contended that the English system
is more democratic.
Mies Anna Fraser, '00, for the
affirmative, defended the committee
system as a cheek on hasty legisla
tion. It is civil service reform we
need, not a change in government.
Miss Stewart, '00, for the nega
tive, said that the English system
would be more economical and pro
ductive of better administration
than our own.
F. E. Nangle, '03, closing for the
affirmative, argued that the Amer
ican people could not endure the
restraint of the English system. In
England the popular voice is never
heard.
The second debate, " Resolved,
That the enfranchisement of the
negro was expedient," was opened
by E. W. Rice, '02, for the affirm
ative. He asserted that enfran
chisement was the only logical
course. It benefited both negro
and white.
B. P. Crow, '02, for the negative,
claimed that enfranchisement of
whites alone would have been a bet
ter method. The negro was not lit
to become a citizen.
F. B. Wagner, '03, for the affirm
ative, believed that enfranchise
ment has benefited the white man,
and given ambition to the negro.
Charles Quayle, '00, for the nega
tive, dwelt on the evil consequences
of enfranchisement. Crime goes
unpunished and state debts increase
where blacks ;ire in majority.
C. F. Riddel 1, '01, closing for the
affirmative, spoke of enfranchise
ment as justified by results. Since
the war negroes have made greater
progress than whites. Their legisla
tion is wise, and they make good
citizens.
