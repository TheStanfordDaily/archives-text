# 1901 Quad Benefit.
## 
### 
The announcement that the man
agement of the 1901 " Quad " had
been able to engage "Teddy " Hart
man of the Tivoli for an afternoon
here has aroused a good deal of in
terest. Ferris Hartman takes rank
as the leading comedian of Amer
ica. In the part he is now playing,
the aeronaut in the " Idol's Eye,"
now running at the Tivoli, " Teddy "
has scored the greatest hit in all his
career. He will be heard here in
the chapel next Thursday afternoon
in a repertoire of songs and mono
logues that have made him famous
as an entertainer. He will be as
sisted by Tom Greene, the tenor of
the Tivoli, who achieved so much
success during the season of grand
opera which has just closed. Greene
will be perhaps remembered for his
true make-up as Coach Chamberlin
at the Thanksgiving show.
Seats for the performance will be
on sale tomorrow and Wednesday
at the University postoflice and at
Hall's in Palo Alto.
