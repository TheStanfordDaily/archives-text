# Exciting Runaway.

Mrs. S. J. Brun and her little
son had a narrow escape from death
Saturday afternoon. They were
driving in Palo Alto, when the
horse became frightened and started
to run. All efforts to stop him were
useless, and it was not until he had
run as far as Burlingame that he
was finally brought to a standstill.
Mrs. Brun and the little boy kept
their seats the whole time, and
though not injured in the slightest
way, were thoroughly exhausted
after the long drive.
