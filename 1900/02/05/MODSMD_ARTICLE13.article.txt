The subscription started at Har
vard in the spring of 1898 for the
purchase of the late Professor
James Russell Lowell's collection
of books in the Romance Langua
ges has finally reached the re
quired amount and the books have
been transferred to the Gore Hall
library. The collection numbers
700 volumes, all handsomely
bound, and a large number are ex
tremely rare: The subjects treated
are of a very wide scope, but the
strength of the collection is in the
number of Medieval French works
which it contains. In addition,
there are works in Spanish, Italian,
Portuguese, and German; a few
in later Latin, aud in the language
of Provencal. â€” Ynle News.
