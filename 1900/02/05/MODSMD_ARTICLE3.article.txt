# "THE BEAUTIFUL GATE."
## Dr. Jordan Delivered an Impressive Sermon in the Chapel Yesterday Morning. 
### 
Dr. Jordan's text for the sermon
yesterday morning on " The Beauti
ful Gate" was taken from Acts
iii, 2 : "And they brought a man
lame from his birth, whom they
laid daily at the Gate of the Temple
which is called Beautiful."
" 1 was in the Mojave desert not
long ago," Dr. Jordan said, "and
saw the great, red sun as it set be
hind the mountains. This desert
is the one barren and arid spot in
the midst of what we think is the
most beautiful country in the world,
yet even here the beauty of the sun
set shows itself. Nowhere is the
outline of the mountains more clear
and distinct, nowhere is the air
more pure. Little shore larks find
abundant sustenance in the seeds
of the desert plants. Coyotes, rab
bits, and eagles all live here peace
fully, and find life, beauty, and
happiness. We do not care what
the real significance of all this is,
or what it proves; these creatures
fit their surroundings and are
happy. Adaptation to conditions
brings happiness.
" Weak and untrained minds are
afraid of what they cannot see, as
children doubt unseen powers which
seem not always good. The wise
man true fo - the unknown, works his
way into it and finds it known like
the rest of the universe. All truth
belongs to him. Says Dr. Dole:
'The realm of doubt is no foreign or
dangerous country, a devil's land
that we must beware of. It is a part
of the universe. Let us traverse it
as far as man can. If there are
deep forests, let us explore them,
and open up the light. Is there
any fact in this dark continent that
threatens to hurt us? Let us march
up to such a fact and interrogate it
and hear what it has to Bay for it
self. Is it possible that any one
believes in religion and yet is afraid
of truth?'
"If we search boldly we shall
find, as all wise men have found, (
justice, sweetness, and fairness, at
the heart of the universe. We have
heard our fathers speak of the
'Goodness and severity of God.' 1
like that phrase and shall never
preach a sermon without quoting
it. God could not be good without
being just, and severity is a neces
sary quality of justice.
"We write a minus sign before
every good thing and it turns to
bad, for all wrong is only good in
completed. Vice is good impulse
premature and ineffective. Anger
is simply the reaction of good im
pulse, immature and ineffective;
war, one of the most evil things on
earth, is only misdirected energy.
The only reality in life is pain.
If you have a few hours to wait at
a railroad station you are uncom
fortable, —but pain is only relative,
—the gauge which tells you that
you are doing nothing.
"There is no evil intent in the
harm that comes to us. Fire
turned loose burns down a house;
a Hood destroys a farm. If you
build your house on sand, the
water undermines it and the house
falls. Yielding to self-indulgence

undermines character so that when
the test comes the character is
found wanting. Yet when we
look at it from the outside we see
that there is no evil intent in the
Hoods, fire, or in the failure of
sand, or of character. Secure
your fires, control your floods,
build on a rock, cultivate self-con
trol, and when the time of trial
comes, it will find you steadfast.
Life is full of light and happiness
which no personal misery can
destroy.
" The fact is that man finds new
uses for things he once cursed. The
area which he calls good is con
stantly being enlarged. What
sort of a Satan is it whose works
need only to be studied and han
dled, —and lo! they are changed
into good !
"So we can, any of us, by love,
effort, and devotion, change our
valley of cursed mountains to
dawn-lit vales of Chamouny. It is
possible that any life may be made
beautiful and sweet by self-devo
tion and self-restraint. In the
shepherd's hut or the king's palace;
with David on the Judean hills or
with David in the palace at Jerusa
lem; with iEsop the slave, or Mar
cus Antonius the emperor; with
Peter the hot-headed fisherman, or
with Emerson the open-eyed phil
osopher; it is always the same —
the better way leads to the gate
called Beautiful. Through this
door come to us all wisdom, har
harmony, peace, and courage.
" There is a French story called
'The Lame Devil' which tells of
how a wicked and malicious devil
was borne to the gate called Beau
tiful and went away, no longer
lame, no longer wicked, and no
longer a devil. So it is that there
is no devil save our own failures,
the imperfections of a child race,
the beginnings of good through
weaknessor perversity gone wrong."

and open up the light. Is there
any fact in this dark continent that
threatens to hurt us? Let us march
up to such a fact and interrogate it
and hear what it has to Bay for it
self. Is it possible that any one
believes in religion and yet is afraid
of truth?'
"If we search boldly we shall
find, as all wise men have found, (
justice, sweetness, and fairness, at
the heart of the universe. We have
heard our fathers speak of the
'Goodness and severity of God.' 1
like that phrase and shall never
preach a sermon without quoting
it. God could not be good without
being just, and severity is a neces
sary quality of justice.
"We write a minus sign before
every good thing and it turns to
bad, for all wrong is only good in
completed. Vice is good impulse
premature and ineffective. Anger
is simply the reaction of good im
pulse, immature and ineffective;
war, one of the most evil things on
earth, is only misdirected energy.
The only reality in life is pain.
If you have a few hours to wait at
a railroad station you are uncom
fortable, —but pain is only relative,
—the gauge which tells you that
you are doing nothing.
"There is no evil intent in the
harm that comes to us. Fire
turned loose burns down a house;
a Hood destroys a farm. If you
build your house on sand, the
water undermines it and the house
falls. Yielding to self-indulgence

undermines character so that when
the test comes the character is
found wanting. Yet when we
look at it from the outside we see
that there is no evil intent in the
Hoods, fire, or in the failure of
sand, or of character. Secure
your fires, control your floods,
build on a rock, cultivate self-con
trol, and when the time of trial
comes, it will find you steadfast.
Life is full of light and happiness
which no personal misery can
destroy.
" The fact is that man finds new
uses for things he once cursed. The
area which he calls good is con
stantly being enlarged. What
sort of a Satan is it whose works
need only to be studied and han
dled, —and lo! they are changed
into good !
"So we can, any of us, by love,
effort, and devotion, change our
valley of cursed mountains to
dawn-lit vales of Chamouny. It is
possible that any life may be made
beautiful and sweet by self-devo
tion and self-restraint. In the
shepherd's hut or the king's palace;
with David on the Judean hills or
with David in the palace at Jerusa
lem; with iEsop the slave, or Mar
cus Antonius the emperor; with
Peter the hot-headed fisherman, or
with Emerson the open-eyed phil
osopher; it is always the same —
the better way leads to the gate
called Beautiful. Through this
door come to us all wisdom, har
harmony, peace, and courage.
" There is a French story called
'The Lame Devil' which tells of
how a wicked and malicious devil
was borne to the gate called Beau
tiful and went away, no longer
lame, no longer wicked, and no
longer a devil. So it is that there
is no devil save our own failures,
the imperfections of a child race,
the beginnings of good through
weaknessor perversity gone wrong."
