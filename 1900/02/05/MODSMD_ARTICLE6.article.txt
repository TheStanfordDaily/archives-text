It would be well for the mem
bers of the Intercollegiate Debating
League to insist upon more careful
management of debating interests
by the executive committee of the
League than has been shown in the
preliminary debates of this semes
ter. The work of the committee in
these preliminaries has been an
exhibition of bungling mismanage
ment, and whether the blame rests
with the society representatives or
with those who are at the head of
the executive committee is a mat
ter which the members of the
League should look into.
