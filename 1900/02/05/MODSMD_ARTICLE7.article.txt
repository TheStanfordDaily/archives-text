In little more than two months
the annual chess tournament with
Berkeley is scheduled to take place.
Early in the semester we called at
tention to the lack of activity on
the part of the Chess Club, and
urged that some action, either neg
ative or affirmatfve, be taken. If
that organization does not soon
show signs of life, it will be the
duty of the Executive Committee
to take Stanford's chess interests
out of their hands altogether. We
cannot afford to entrust any privi
lege, however small, to a body
which shows so little interest in the
honor of the University as has the
Chess Club for some time past.
