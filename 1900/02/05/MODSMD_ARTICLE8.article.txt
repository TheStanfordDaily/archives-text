The debates held in the chapel
last Saturday evening brought to
notice a feature of our debating
system which, we think, should not
go unremedied, â€”that is, the prac
tice of not exempting an alternate
on an intercollegiate debating team
from participation in the semi-final
debates along with actual intercol
legiate participants. The latter are
considered as entitled to this privi
lege, and we think the alternate is
no less worthy of the honor than
are they. One who occupies this

position in us much a part of the
intercollegiate team as are the actual
participants. All the burdens are
shared, yet is the smallest of the hon
ors to be denied? One cannot but ad
mit that an alternate in winningthat
position has not fallen far short of
the debating standard of the team.
Certainly they have shown an abil
ity which makes necessary their
participation in the semi-finals but
a farce, and an act of injustice en
tirely uncalled for. It is a matter
which the Intercollegiate Debating
League can well reconsider in order
that a permanent precedent may
be laid down for allowing this little
recognition of the services rendered
by an alternate.
