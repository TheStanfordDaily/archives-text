# NEW COLLEGE BUILDINGS.
## Contractor McGilvray Pushing the Workâ€”Stonecutters Arrive from the East. 
### 
A matter of the greatest interest
to the students and friends of Stan
ford University is the new build
ings. A short time ago the rumor
became current that at least four
new buildings, the History and
Economics, Philosophy and Psy
chology, Chemistry laboratory, and
Postollice would be constructed im
mediately, the funds for the pur
pose being taken from the principal
of the University endowments. At
that time a major portion of our
endowment was bringing in small
returns, but now Mrs. Stanford,
having sold her holdings in the
Pacific railroads, is placing the
funds where in a very short time
the income will be considerably in
advance of the running expenses
of the University. This fact has
determined her to leave the princi
pal intact, constructing new build
ings as fast as possible and expe
dient from the surplus earning of
the endowment. Mrs. Stanford is
now on her way East, her object
being to invest the remaining un
invested funds, and definite infor
mation regarding anything except
the buildings now in progress must
await her return.
It is known, however, that archi
tects are now at work, and have
been for some time past, on the
four buildings above mentioned.
The Chemical building, in all prob
ability, will be started within the
next sixty days. It will be located
in one of two places, either facing
the avenue on the clearing made
by the removal of the art building,
or facing the same avenue on the
northwest corner of the avenue
leading past Roble and Encina.
The building will be two stories
high, with a 200-foot front, follow
ing the prevailing style of architec
ture as far as possible, without the
facade feature. The building will
contain every convenience for scien
tific study.
So little is decided in regard to
the History, English, and Econom
ics building that nothing except a
few can be related. It
will form a right angle, adjoining
the new library on the east, with
110-foot front each way. It will be
two stories in height, with facade,
and the architectural motif will be
in keeping with the other buildings
of the outer quadrangle. The
building exactly corresponding to
it on the west will be occupied by
the departments of Philosophy,
Psychology, and Education. It is
likely that these buildings will be
commenced before six months'
time, but whether earlier than that
cannot be said. There is an equal
indefiniteness about the postoflice
building, its shape, location, and
time of construction.
The contract for the new chapel
and the Science building requires
that they be completed by Septem
ber Ist of this year, and contractor
McGilvray will bend all his ener
gies to that end. There are at pres
ent fifty men working, and within
a week as many more cutters and
setters will arrive from the East
and go to work. Construction will

be pushed rapidly from now on, es
pecially on the chapel. A point
will soon be reached in the build
ing when a wait will be necessary,
until the iron for the flooring ar
rives. The entire force will then
be placed on the chapel. In a few
days several carloads of stone for
the altar-pieces are expected, and
these, when in place, will give a
faint idea of what the beauty of the
interior is to be.
