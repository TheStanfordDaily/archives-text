During the last storm several
pedestrians and one bicyclist going
to and from the gymnasium crossed
the baseball field near the home
plate. Such glaring disregard of
repeated requests to keep off the
diamond, at least during damp
weather, has reached a climax, and
such acts can no longer be credited
to forgetfulness and ignorance, but
to pure vandalism. It seems hard
to believe that we have among us
persons who care so little for the
wishes of their fellows, the good of
the University and the safety of
the baseball men. Every footprint
and mark of this character on the
diamond is a standing menace to
the players. For their protection,
walking on the diamond is abso
lutely forbidden, except when it is
thoroughly dry, and if an appeal
to the gentlemanly instincts of stu
dents is not going to be sufficient,

then some drastic measures will
have to he taken with any one here
after found on the diamond at
times forbidden.
