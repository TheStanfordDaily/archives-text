# Campus Improvements.
## 
### 
During the winter months, work
on the University grounds has been
steadily pushed forward, and the
improvements will be continued
throughout the year. The rect
angular grass plots in front of
the Memorial Arch are to be made
elliptical, with broad drives around
them, and the circular plots in the
quad will be improved. The road
way, bicycle path, and foot path to
Palo Alto are to be drained so that
no water will stand on them as
heretofore. It has not been decided
definitely how the space back of the
Memorial Arch will be ornamented.
All shade trees on the University
grounds are being cultivated and
new trees set in place of those that
have died.
