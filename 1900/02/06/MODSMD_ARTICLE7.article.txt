# Class Game Tomorrow.
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 the
interclass baseball game between
'00 and '01 will be called. The
meeting of these two classes is sure
to draw a crowd of yelling parti
sans as the keenest rivalry exists
between the wearers of the plug
and those of the sombrero. The
Juniors have, at present, the better
of the diamond argument in hav
ing won by a score of nine to seven
what was probably the most mem
orable class baseball game in the
history of the University. The
whole matter will be settled on the
diamond tomorrow.
In order to collect from everyone
who attends, Treasurer Leiter has
stretched ropes beyond which no
one can go except on payment of
the admission fee of ten cents.
The line-up of the two contesting
teams will be as follows: '01 —
Swindells, captain,c.; p., Edwards ;
lb, Bentley ; 2b, Havens; s.s., Sy
monds ; 3b, Lawrence; 1. 112., Ben
nett ; c. 112., Erb ; r. 112., Pitman, Par
kin. '00 —Strohn.c.; p., Lanagan;
lb, Dutton ; 2b, Coffin ; s. s., Loug
heed ; 3b, Murphy, captain ; 1. 112.,
