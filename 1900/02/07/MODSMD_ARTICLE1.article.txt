## Juniors Defeated in a Close and Exciting Game of Baseball. 
### 
A large number of partisans of
the Junior and Senior Classes filled
the bleachers at the second of the
series of inter-class baseball games
this afternoon. Much merriment
was evoked at the attempts of some
of the players and joshes were
freely passed around.

on Murphy's hit. In the second
Coverley knocked out a two-bagger
and scored 011 Hawley's hit. Haw

and Lougheed also made a run on
Edward's error. In 'the first half
of the third inning Parkin scored
011 Dutton's error. In the first of the
fourth Bennett scored on Edward's
two-bagger, and in the first of the
fifth Swindells scored 011 Symonds'
two-bagger and Symonds scored in
his turn, on Bennett's hit.
The deciding score was won by
the Seniors in the second half of the
fifth inning, Murphy bringing in
Strohn by a three-base hit. In the
first of the sixth three Juniors were
stopped at first in one, two, three
order. The Seniors were stopped
in the second half of the sixth with
out scoring. The seventh and
eight were a repetition of the sixth,
neither team scoring, the Seniors
thus winning by a score of 5-4.
Both teams received enthusiastic
support from the side-lines.
