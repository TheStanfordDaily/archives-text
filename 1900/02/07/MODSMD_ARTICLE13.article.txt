The second of our Varsity's ser
ies of practice games with the Fire
man's Fund team will be held at
San Francisco Saturday afternoon.
The contest is sure to be interesting
from an athletic standpoint and
should prove no less so as an indi
cation of Stanford's progress in base
ball since the beginning of prac
tice. Attendance at the game will
go well with that at the debate on
the preceding evening. A large
number of rooters should turn out.
Being in the city, there will be no
excuse for their non-attendance.
