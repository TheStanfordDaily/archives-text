Friday evening the annual Car
not debate will be held in Hearst
Hall at Berkeley. The associated
students there have extended us a
cordial invitation, not only to at
tend, but to spend enough time
with them to accept of their hos
pitalities. Campus intercollegiate
contests have been of such infre
quent occurrence in the past that
the Carnot has stood out as an oc
casion for an extension of courtesies
which was afforded at no other
time in the year. The present in
vitation will be accepted with many

thanks. We cannot know too
much of the conditions at our sis
ter institution, and what few oppor
tunities are presented for increas
ing that knowledge ought to be
taken advantage of. A Berkeley
committee will meet the Stanford
delegation and show them around.
It is their desire, of course, that a
large number accept their courtesy.
