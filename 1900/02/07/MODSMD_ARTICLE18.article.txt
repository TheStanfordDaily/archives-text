### 
Whereas, The sad news has just
come to us of the death of Dr. Amos
Griswold Warner, now for some
years officially connected with us
as Professor of Applied Economics;
be it
Resolved, That we, the Faculty of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, extend to the bereaved fam
ily the assurance that our sympa
thies are with them in their sor
row. We have lost a friend of
noble character and gracious per
sonality. The University has lost
one of its most valued helpers â€”
one whose services to it and to so
ciety at large were as earnest and
unselfish as they were distin
guished. The name of Dr. War
ner will long be held here in kindly
and reverent remembrance.
