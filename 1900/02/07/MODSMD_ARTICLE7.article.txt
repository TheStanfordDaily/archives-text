# "PORTIA AND HER SUITORS."
## Professor Ticknor Gives an Elaborate Portrayal of these Famous Personages. 
### 
The regular Tuesday evening lec
ture was delivered in the chapel by
Prof. Howard M. Ticknor of Bos
ton on "Portia and Her Suitors,"
a snbject on which Prof. Ticknor is
thoroughly conversant through
a long residence in Italy and a
consequent insight into Italian
character. He said in part:
"Shakepeare never leaves us in
doubt as to the final plan of his
plays, but he does not always indi
cate at the beginning what is his
great idea. So it is in the Merchant
of Venice. The prevailing idea is
that the play was written solely as
a background for the Jew. Shylock,
but this is not so, for Bassanio is
really the principal character.
"Bassanio wants to borrow
money and this places his friend
Antonio in jeopardy; but the cause
of this was that he wanted to
marry a very desirable young wo
man, Portia, the most famous
beauty of northern Italy.
"Commonly Portia is considered
a mild-mannered, good-natured
young woman whose greatest merit
was her wealth and beauty. Let
us examine her character and see
if she was a girl worthy of the fuss
made over her. Perhaps the first
question is in regard to her per
sonality. If Agas√üiz could recon
struct a fish from a single bone,
maybe we can gain some enlighten
ment from the few lines which re
fer to Portia. Bassanio speaks of
her golden hair. This, even to the
present day, is the characteristic of
the beauties of northern Italy.
Now, what would we expect to find
her disposition, grave or gay?
Venice was the home of vivacity
and intrigue; masks and masking
thrived. Thus we might expect to
find in Portia a girl who loved
gaiety and who was ready for any
kind of sport at any time."
Professor Ticknor now read por
tions of the 'Merchant of Venice'
including the scene where the suit
ors make their choice, the success
ful choice of Bassanio, and the
final episode of the ring.
Prof. Ticknor closed as follows:
"Whatever our opinion of Portia's
character, I think we can be cer
tain of two things: Portia will live
up to all the good and loving and
faithful things she has promised
Bassanio, and she will never be a
monotonous wife."
