# ARRANGEMENTS FOR CARNOT.
## The 						Announcement of the Order of the Speakers Made This Afternoon. 
### 
The announcement was made
this afternoon of the order of the
speakers in the Carnot, and the
sides upon which each will debate.
The result is as follows: First
affirmative, Willsie M. Martin;
first negative, J. F. English; second
affirmative, Cecil M. Marrack;
second negative, John E. Springer;
third affirmative, \V. B. Greeley;
third negative, Fred E. Borton.
The drawing was made last week
in San Francisco by President
Wheeler and Dr. Jordan, and was
made public today at two o'clock
by Dr. Fetter, chairman of the
faculty committee.
The result of the drawing is en
tirely satisfactory to our men.
They know thoroughly the whole
subject, and each one was ready to
take up either side. The only dis
advantage in the drawing is that
the three Stanford men come to
gether, but this hardly counts
against them.
The team leaves here tomorrow
morning with the debating com
mittee, and will reach Berkeley
only in time for the debate. L. B.
Wickersham is to have charge of
the arrangements of the trip.
Anthony Suzzallo of last year's
team will be with the men tomor
row.
W. B. Greeley, the third affirma
tive for Berkeley, attended Stan
ford for a semester. He was a mem
ber of the local chapter of Delta
Upsilon, and while here was also a
member of Euphronia.
President Cover ley of the Asso
ciated Students is making every
arrangement for Stanford to be
well represented at Berkeley on
Friday night, and nothing remains
but for a large delegation of stu
dents to go if we wish the debaters
to have the hearty support they
merit. A special invitation to the
women of Stanford from the Asso
ciated Women Students of Berkeley
has been received and a committee
of the latter will be at the trains to
see that all Stanford women are
well cared for.
In order to insure comfortable
accommodations at the debate for
all the supporters of the Cardinal,
President Dorety of the Berkeley
student body has issued special
tickets of admission. These tickets
will be placed in the Registrar's
office and will be given out with
railroad certificates tomorrow.
They can also be obtafned on the
11:59 and the 3:06 trains tomor
row.
All who can do so should take
the 3 o'clock boat from San Fran
cisco in order to see the Berkeley
campus under the guidance of the
Berkeley reception committee.
A vigorous display of the Cardi
nal is urged by President Coverley
and all should have Stanford pen
nants and cardinal handkerchiefs.
The men of the University will
wear their cardinal vests.
Those who will have charge of
the rooting request that all Stan
ford people get in a compact body
in order to give the best possible
support to the team. An effort is

being made to have "Bill" Irwin
and other alumni present to help
in the "gingering up."
Professor Fetter received an an
nouncement, late this afternoon, of
the appointment of the three judges
for tomorrow evening's debate.
They will be: Judge Hunt of the
Superior Court of San Francisco
county, Judge Harrison,California
Supreme Court Justice, and Donald
G. Campbell, a San Francisco law
yer. The first two were suggested
by Stanford and agreed to by the
Berkeley committee, while the last
was their suggestion. Judge Hunt
was requested to serve at the last
intercollegiate debate but circum
stances prevented him from ac
cepting.
