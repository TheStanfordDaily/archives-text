After several months of more
or less instructive agitation certain
definite athletic propositions have
soon to be decided. Student opin
ion upon several of them has crys
talized sufficiently, perhaps, to de
mand that Stanford take a decided

stand. One of these is the ques
sion of holding the intercollegiate
field-day on the campus. With
the changes in the Olympic grounds
in San Francisco, the possibility of
holding this event on neutral
ground was last year entirely re
moved. It was evident that some
permanentdeparture from previous
custom in the matter had to he
adopted. But that the innovation,
whatever it should he, had to be a
fair one to both universities, was
too evident to need comment.
With this condition of affairs be
fore them, representatives of the
two universities met together to
provide a solution of the difficulty.
Our men were delegated for such
purposes by the student body; they
represented Stanford at a confer
ence where it was known that bus
iness had to be transacted which
would demand compromise and
necessitate arrangements of more
than one year's standing to be fair
to both parties. In a word, they
spoke for us, and honor, if not a
spirit of fairness, would compel us
to observe theirarrangements. We
thought they were to meet their
equals â€”men from the University
of California whose official prom
ises would have some influence on
the track management this year.
These representatives of Berkeley
gave explicit promises that the field
day would be held on the Stanford
campus this year in return for our
going to their grounds last spring.
Without such an agreement, does
anyone think that our last year's
management would have thrown
away the ten points which a field
day on home grounds clearly
meant to Berkeley? It was made
in a spirit of compromise and in
the interest of a department of
athletics in which Berkeley was es
pecially strong. We now insist
upon a performance of the second
half of the agreement. Not only
does fairness and equality demand
that the field-day be held here this
year, but every idea of indepen
dence will prevent us from agreeing
to such a manifest submission as
that wouldbe which the track man
agement of the University of Cal
ifornia now demands.
