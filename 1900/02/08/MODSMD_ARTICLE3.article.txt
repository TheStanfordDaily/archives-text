# Fire in Laboratory.
## 
### 
Vigorous toots of the University
whistle at a quarter of six this
evening announced a fire in the
Assay laboratory next to the black
smith shop. The Camp fire de
partment, under the leadership of
C. M.Wardall,'ol, responded within
a few moments, and through their
efficiency fire hose was attached to a
plug and a strong force of water
quickly thrown into the room. The
flames were soon extinguished.
Beyond the slight damage done
by the smoke and water, nothing
was injured. Several pair of scales
and a number of chemicals were
more or less damaged. No one
was present when the fire started.
The only theory of its origin is that
some hot crucibles were carelessly
left on a pile of gunny sacks by late
workers in the laboratory.
