# CARNOT DEBATERS.
## Records of the Men Who Will Speak at Berkeley Tonight. 
### 
The Carnot debate that takes
place in Hearst Hall, Berkeley, to
night, will be the sixth annual con
test for the Carnot medal. The
medal has been won but once for
Stanford, in 1895 by A. L. Sand
wick, '95. However, this year our
chances are very favorable. We
have the strongest team Stanford
has put forward in years, and
there can be no doubt that the
team will make the best showing
possible.
The subject for the debate to
night as announced last week is,
"Resolved, That the Ministers
Should be Responsible to the Pres
ident Alone." According to the
rules governing the contest, each
man has fifteen minutes and is
allowed to divide his time as he
thinks best.
J. F. English, who will be the
first speaker for Stanford, is a ju
nior and registers from San Fran
cisco, where he prepared for col
lege at the Lowell High School.
While at the high school he repre
sented Lowell in a contest with
Oakland. While this is the first
time he has represented Stanford
in an intercollegiate contest, he
has been prominent in local debat
ing circles, representing his class in
the interclass debate with '02 last
year, and making the finals in the
contest for the intercollegiate team.
English is the most polished
speaker of the team and gives
great promise of success in future
contests. He is a member of Phil
olexian and his major is Law.
Cecil M. Marrack, who will be
second affirmative, is also a junior
and registers from San Francisco,
where he and English were class
mates in the Lowell High School.
He has never represented Stanford
before, but has taken part in the
debates for places on Intercol
legiate teams. He represented his
class in the debate with '02 last
year. He is a most careful and
conscientious worker, and will make
a good showing tonight. Marrack
is a member of Euphronia and is
an English major.
John E. Springer, who will be
the second negative speaker, is the
only veteran on the Stanford team,
having represented the Cardinal
on both the Carnot and Intercolle
giate teams last year. He is un
ctoubtedby the strongest man on
the team on account of his experi
ence gained in intercollegiate con
tests both at the lowa University
and here at Stanford. Springer is
a senior and registers from lowa.
He is a member of Euphronia and
his major is Economics.
The first speaker of the evening
will be W. M. Martin,a senior in the
College of Letters, Berkeley. Martin
comes from the Santa Ana High
School, where he graduated in '95.
He began debating in his sopho
more year, and was the leader of
the 1900 team that defeated the '01
team. In 1899 he was chosen
speaker of the Students Congress,
and last week was elected president
of the senior class.
Fred E. Borton is the first repre
sentative that the Hastings Law

College has had on the Carnot
team for some years. Borton grad
uated from the Berkeley High
School in '98, and entered the 1900
class of the law college. He de
bated during his high school course,
and was a member of the team
from the Berkeley High that
defeated the Oakland team in 1897.
Last year was his first year in uni
versity debating, when he was a
substitute on the intercollegiate
debate.
William B. Greeley, '01, is from
the San Jose High School, where he
was one of the debaters in the High
School debate. Greeley entered
Stanford with the '01 Class, but
left after a year to go to Berkeley.
This is his first experience in uni
versity debating. He is registered
in the College of Social Sciences.
