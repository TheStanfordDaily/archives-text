We have been requested to ask
all Seniors who have not already
done so, to return immediately the
information cards sent out by the
Annual Board. The information
for which these cards call must go
to the printer soon, and if the in
dividual members of the class do
not respond without delay, it will
be necessary for the material to be
put into shape by the editors. They
cannot be expected to attain accur
acy in every particular without cor
rect data.
