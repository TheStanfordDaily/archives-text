Tomorrow the intercollegiate ath
letic committees will make another

attempt to draw up an agreement
which will be satisfactory to stu
dent bodies of the two universities.
Whatever they do they will be
hampered in not having authority
to take final and decisive action.
With the powers they have neither
committee can agree to anything
beyond that they will present the
results of the conference to their
athletic committees for ratification.
We think this to be all wrong. If
we are to reach any satisfactory
conclusions we must give our dele
gates authority to act for us. We
have plenty of men in the Univer
sity who are competent to do this;
our present committee is thor
oughly so. Until we allow it, we
may expect to be in a continual
muddle.
