# BASEBALL TOMORROW.
## Second Scheduled Game of the Varsity Series in the City Tomorrow. 
### 
The Varsity will play the Fire
man's Fund team tomorrow after
noon in San Francisco at the
Eighth and Harrison street grounds
game to be called at 3:00 p.m. This
is the second scheduled game the
men have had a chance at, and as
the team work has been much im
proved since the last game with the
Firemen, it should be a very inter
esting event. The Firemen have
also improved in their work and
will be able to put up a finished
game. Berkeley was defeated last
week by this team by a score of
7-4, as compared to Stanford's de
feat of 8-3. This gives Berkeley a
better showing, but at that time
they had had more practice work
than our team.
There will probably be a large
number of Stanford students in the
city tomorrow, and as many as
possible should turn out at the
game and give the team their sup
port. Admission price to the game
will be twenty-five cents. The line
up will be as follows:
STANFORD. FIREMAN'S FUND.
