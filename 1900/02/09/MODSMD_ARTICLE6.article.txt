# Athletic Agreement.

### 
D. E. Brown, '97, 0. C. Leiter,
'99, and Clias. Cantwell, '01, Stan
ford's representatives on the Inter
collegiate Athletic Committee, will
meet the representatives of Berke
ley in a conference at the Palace
hotel in San Francisco tomorrow
morning to talk over the proposed
athletic agreement between Stan
ford and Berkeley.
The committee met two weeks
ago and drew up an agreement
which was referred to the athletic
committees of the two universi
ties for ratification. Each com
mittee made some changes. Stan
ford accepted the article relating to
graduate coaches, while the U. C.
athletic committee stood for East
ern coaches. Our committee de
sires to hold Berkeley to her pledge
to contest the field-day on our
oval this year in consideration of
Stanford's promise to compete on
the U. C. track last spring. The
U. C. committee wishes to back
out of that promise and desires the
meet to be held on their own oval.
There is also a dispute as to the
order of events. Berkeley desires
an order which will allow Drum to
enter three events. Our represen
tatives care little in what o>der the
events occur, as in the long run
any definite order will be as fair
for one university as for the other.
A compromise will probably be
effected, each side giving up some
thing. The question of Eastern
coaches admits of no compromise.
But the order in which the events
in the field-day are to occur can be
compromised easily enough. What
ever the compromise is, a clause

will be inserted providing that the
agreement be accepted or rejected
as a whole; for otherwise the ath
letic committee of one univer
sity could accept the concessions
of the other, and if the agreement
were accepted as a whole by the
committee of the other, an advan
tage would thereby be gained by
one university.
Whatever agreement is reached
will be referred to the athletic com
mittees of the two colleges to be
finally accepted or rejected.
