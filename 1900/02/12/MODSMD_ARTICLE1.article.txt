Hearst Hall Crowded for the Carnot.
—Professors Talk on the
Outcome.
The annual Carnot debate was
held in Berkeley last Friday night
at Hearst Hall. About a hundred
students from Stanford attended
and were accorded every courtesy
by the State University people. In
their honor the hall was given a
cardinal hue by many colored
electric lights, and the only decor
ations on the stage were red
flowers. There were, of course,
many good-natured twittings about
recent athletic contests, but the
general tone of good fellowship was
manifested several times by the
union yell from the lusty throats
of the entire audience.
When the Stanford team walked
across the stage to their ante-room
on the further side, they were
cheered heartily. The men with
red vests and the womeh with
cardinal streamers arose in a body
and assured the team that they
were "all right."
In a few moments both teams
appeared upon the stage again and
took seats at the tables prepared
for them. Prof. Clapp of Berkeley
presided. In a short speech he
outlined for the judges and the
audience the general plan of the
Carnot debate, telling of the insti
tution of the medal as a prize to be
contested for by both universities,
and of the general rules governing
the contest.
Eager eyes began at once to peer
around the room to catch, if possi
ble, a glimpse of the judges. They
were soon found. Judge Harrison
of the Supreme Court of California
and Donald Y. Campbell of
the San Francisco bar were seated
immediately behind the section
reserved for Stanford, and Judge
Hunt of the Superior Court was
among those who wore the blue
and gold.
Willsie M. Martin of the
University of California led the ar
gument for the affirmative. In
style, delivery, and gesture, it was
just such another speech as
Martin has been heard in twice
before in intercollegiate contests.
J. F. English, '01, then came
forward and with great delibera
tion and admirable argument led
for the negative. The contrast be
tween English and the pre
ceding speaker was a striking one.
Instead of Martin's excited ner
vousness and impassioned gesticu
lation there was a seriousness and
sobriety of argument that seemed
to indicate great reserve power.
In further support of the affir
mative Cecil M. Marrack, '01, took
the floor. His earnest manner and
sincerity won him many friends.
By this time it was evident that
the representation of Stanford in
the debate was in every respect of
the highest rank, and excitement
began to rise in anticipation of
final victory.
J. E. Springer, '00, was the sec
ond speaker on the negative. His
strength lay in his oratory and
great persuasive powers. In these
respects he far outclassed any
speaker of the evening, and those
in the audience who were from

Stanford cheered him with great
enthusiasm.
W. B. Greeley concluded the ar
gument for the affirmative and
F. E. Borton for the negative. They
both represented the University of
California. Greeley will be re
membered aB a former student at
Stanford, where he was a member
of Euphronia Debating Society.
Borton spoke much after the man
ner of Warner, who won the Car
not medal last year, relying for his
strength wholly on argument.
In the rebuttal speeches Martin
led with great fervor, and was fol
lowed by English, who, in his for
mer cool manner, called attention
to the facts of the case. Martin
had attempted to support the af
firmative by speaking of the dis
agreement in the statements of the
different members of the negative.
English lost no time in calling at
tention to this —for according to
the plan of the debate, it is impos
sible that there should be any
other than an accidental agree
ment between the statements of the
individual members of a given
side.
Marrack and Springer did not in
their rebuttal speeches show any
marked advance over their first
arguments. Greeley was possibly not
quite as good, but Borton did dis
tinctly better.
As Borton finished the judges
retired to consider their verdict,
and, after some ten minutes of de
liberation, announced a unanimous
verdict for Willsie M. Martin, of
the University of California.
In making the award Judge
Hunt said that the judges greatly
regretted that there were not three
medals to give instead of only one,
and this is an index of the general
feeling that had the total represen
tation of each University been con
sidered in making the award there
would have been no question as to
the Cardinal's superiority. The
Enquirer of Oakland particularly
mentioned Springer, referring to
him as one of the best debaters who
has ever spoken for Stanford. The
excellent argument presented by
English and the sincerity of Mar
rack's address were highly praised
by many competent critics. It is
said that the award was made to
Martin because of his good rebuttal,
and that up to that part of the de
bate he was not ranked first by the
judges.
Professor F. A. Fetter of the
Economics department, and chair
man of the faculty debating com
mittee, when seen today expressed
himself as not at all discouraged by
the showing which we made, lie
said:
" The debate on the whole was a
very good one, and superior, I
think, to any held in several years.
As for the individual speaking, it
was Martin against any one of our
men, or of Berkeley's either. Mar
tin's speech showed thorough study
and in the preparation as well as
in delivery it bore the marks of
painstaking drill. As a speaker he
does not give the impression of
possessing phenomenal ability. In
accord with the general opinion, I
think his rebuttal won the debate.
By the very simple expedient of
merely mentioning his opponent as

he touched on his points, he con
verted a carefully-prapared rebut
tal into an apparently extempora
neous effort.
" The comments of the Berkeley
professors indicate that they feared
our three men almost equally. The
one thing lacking was the ready
turn in rebuttal which would have
had the true extemporaneeus ring.
"In regard to the influence of
the debate, I think there is nothing
to justify discouragement, while on
the other hand there are certain very
concrete lessons to be learned
which will contribute to Stan
ford's debating in the future."
Professor Ross, of the Economics
department, when seen on his re
turn from Berkeley, spoke on the
outcome of the debate as follows:
"In the first place, let me say
that I have no criticism to make
on the decision. The debate was
decided as it was because Martin,
although he did not make the best
speech, had the best rebuttal. As
a team our men were stronger than
California's. All three seemed to
me superior to either Mr. Borton or
Mr Greeley.
"The contest shows the unsatisfac
tory nature of the Carnot debate
as an inter-university contest, in as
much as the award goes to the best
individual and not to the best team,
while the team more than the in
dividual indicates the debating
strength of a university. So long
as the contest is individual the
large element of honest doubt in a
decision will inure to the benefit of
the State University and Stanford
will be at a disadvantage. It seems
to me highly desirable that the
character of the debate bechanged;
that the contest be between teams,
not individuals."
Professor C. A. Duniway, of the
History department, feels entirely
satisfied with the showing which
our men made. He commented on
the subject as follows:
"The decision was a just one;
there is nothing to cavil at, but
there is no ground for discourage
ment. The very system of judg
ing which won Fryer of California
the medal two years ago would
have given Marrack the decision in
this debate. So far as use of Eng
lish — polished speaking— is con
cerned, Marrack certainly out
classed his opponents. But Martin
was strong where Marrack was
weak —in rebuttal. Martin's re
buttal undoubtedly won him the
debate. As a team we excelled
Berkeley, and, as I say, we should
feel encouraged rather than- dis
couraged." " ' .

California's. All three seemed to
me superior to either Mr. Borton or
Mr Greeley.
"The contest shows the unsatisfac
tory nature of the Carnot debate
as an inter-university contest, in as
much as the award goes to the best
individual and not to the best team,
while the team more than the in
dividual indicates the debating
strength of a university. So long
as the contest is individual the
large element of honest doubt in a

the State University and Stanford
will be at a disadvantage. It seems

Hearst Hall Crowded for the Carnot.
—Professors Talk on the
Outcome.
The annual Carnot debate was
held in Berkeley last Friday night
at Hearst Hall. About a hundred
students from Stanford attended
and were accorded every courtesy
by the State University people. In
their honor the hall was given a
cardinal hue by many colored
electric lights, and the only decor
ations on the stage were red
flowers. There were, of course,
many good-natured twittings about
recent athletic contests, but the
general tone of good fellowship was
manifested several times by the
union yell from the lusty throats
of the entire audience.
When the Stanford team walked
across the stage to their ante-room
on the further side, they were
cheered heartily. The men with
red vests and the womeh with
cardinal streamers arose in a body
and assured the team that they
were "all right."
In a few moments both teams
appeared upon the stage again and
took seats at the tables prepared
for them. Prof. Clapp of Berkeley
presided. In a short speech he
outlined for the judges and the
audience the general plan of the
Carnot debate, telling of the insti
tution of the medal as a prize to be
contested for by both universities,
and of the general rules governing
the contest.
Eager eyes began at once to peer
around the room to catch, if possi
ble, a glimpse of the judges. They
were soon found. Judge Harrison
of the Supreme Court of California
and Donald Y. Campbell of
the San Francisco bar were seated
immediately behind the section
reserved for Stanford, and Judge
Hunt of the Superior Court was
among those who wore the blue
and gold.
Willsie M. Martin of the
University of California led the ar
gument for the affirmative. In
style, delivery, and gesture, it was
just such another speech as
Martin has been heard in twice
before in intercollegiate contests.
J. F. English, '01, then came
forward and with great delibera
tion and admirable argument led
for the negative. The contrast be
tween English and the pre
ceding speaker was a striking one.
Instead of Martin's excited ner
vousness and impassioned gesticu
lation there was a seriousness and
sobriety of argument that seemed
to indicate great reserve power.
In further support of the affir
mative Cecil M. Marrack, '01, took
the floor. His earnest manner and
sincerity won him many friends.
By this time it was evident that
the representation of Stanford in
the debate was in every respect of
the highest rank, and excitement
began to rise in anticipation of
final victory.
J. E. Springer, '00, was the sec
ond speaker on the negative. His
strength lay in his oratory and
great persuasive powers. In these
respects he far outclassed any
speaker of the evening, and those
in the audience who were from

Stanford cheered him with great
enthusiasm.
W. B. Greeley concluded the ar
gument for the affirmative and
F. E. Borton for the negative. They
both represented the University of
California. Greeley will be re
membered aB a former student at
Stanford, where he was a member
of Euphronia Debating Society.
Borton spoke much after the man
ner of Warner, who won the Car
not medal last year, relying for his
strength wholly on argument.
In the rebuttal speeches Martin
led with great fervor, and was fol
lowed by English, who, in his for
mer cool manner, called attention
to the facts of the case. Martin
had attempted to support the af
firmative by speaking of the dis
agreement in the statements of the
different members of the negative.
English lost no time in calling at
tention to this —for according to
the plan of the debate, it is impos
sible that there should be any
other than an accidental agree
ment between the statements of the
individual members of a given
side.
Marrack and Springer did not in
their rebuttal speeches show any
marked advance over their first
arguments. Greeley was possibly not
quite as good, but Borton did dis
tinctly better.
As Borton finished the judges
retired to consider their verdict,
and, after some ten minutes of de
liberation, announced a unanimous
verdict for Willsie M. Martin, of
the University of California.
In making the award Judge
Hunt said that the judges greatly
regretted that there were not three
medals to give instead of only one,
and this is an index of the general
feeling that had the total represen
tation of each University been con
sidered in making the award there
would have been no question as to
the Cardinal's superiority. The
Enquirer of Oakland particularly
mentioned Springer, referring to
him as one of the best debaters who
has ever spoken for Stanford. The
excellent argument presented by
English and the sincerity of Mar
rack's address were highly praised
by many competent critics. It is
said that the award was made to
Martin because of his good rebuttal,
and that up to that part of the de
bate he was not ranked first by the
judges.
Professor F. A. Fetter of the
Economics department, and chair
man of the faculty debating com
mittee, when seen today expressed
himself as not at all discouraged by
the showing which we made, lie
said:
" The debate on the whole was a
very good one, and superior, I
think, to any held in several years.
As for the individual speaking, it
was Martin against any one of our
men, or of Berkeley's either. Mar
tin's speech showed thorough study
and in the preparation as well as
in delivery it bore the marks of
painstaking drill. As a speaker he
does not give the impression of
possessing phenomenal ability. In
accord with the general opinion, I
think his rebuttal won the debate.
By the very simple expedient of
merely mentioning his opponent as

he touched on his points, he con
verted a carefully-prapared rebut
tal into an apparently extempora
neous effort.
" The comments of the Berkeley
professors indicate that they feared
our three men almost equally. The
one thing lacking was the ready
turn in rebuttal which would have
had the true extemporaneeus ring.
"In regard to the influence of
the debate, I think there is nothing
to justify discouragement, while on
the other hand there are certain very
concrete lessons to be learned
which will contribute to Stan
ford's debating in the future."
Professor Ross, of the Economics
department, when seen on his re
turn from Berkeley, spoke on the
outcome of the debate as follows:
"In the first place, let me say
that I have no criticism to make
on the decision. The debate was
decided as it was because Martin,
although he did not make the best
speech, had the best rebuttal. As
