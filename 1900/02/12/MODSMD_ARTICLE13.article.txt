# Athletic Committees Meet.

### 
At the meeting of the Intercol
legiate Athletic Committee in San
Francisco Saturday, but two points
relative to the athletic agreement
were discussed. The first point
concerned where the coming field
day should be held; the second
dealt with the subject of graduate
coaches.
As the athletic committee of the
Berkeley student body had refused
to accept the intercollegiate ath
letic committee's decision of refer
ring the question of field-day to an
arbitration committee, composed of
the members of both university
faculty athletic committees, an
other agreement had to be sought.
It was decided to refer the matter
for final settlement to an outside
committee, composed of Professor
Bacon of California, Professor
Richardson of Stanford, and John
Elliott of San Francisco, at pres
ent one of the directors of the
Olympic Club.
The question whether or not the
head coach should be a graduate,
was very thoroughly discussed.
Berkeley did not wish that the
head coach should be a graduate.
Stanford contended that men
should not be given that position
until graduation. Berkeley at first
wished that a man should need to be
on the "varsity" only one year to be
eligible to the position. Stanford
argued that a man could be in
duced to enter college and play on
the college team with the promise
that the following year he could be
made chief coach. The same ar
gument was applied to the two
year limit proposed by Berkeley.
The matter was at last compro
mised, and reads now as follows:
" The head coach must have
either graduated from his univer
sity or been in attendance there
four years. If the aggregate time
of his absences from his university
amounts to one semester, this se
mester of time shall not count
upon bis four years of university
attendance required.''
