Thk committee which will have
charge of Junior Day this year is
announced in another column.
Theirs is by no means the least
important charge which the class
has entrusted to committees. Since
this day has been made an annual
holiday at Stanford, its success
each year will depend upon the en
ergy of those who have it in charge.
The Class of 1901 will have much
to do with setting a precedent in
this regard to be followed in later
years.
