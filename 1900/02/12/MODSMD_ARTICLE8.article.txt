Though the Carnot medal has
again been lost to Stanford, still
we have nothing to regret beyond
the mere fact of losing it. Our
team did everything that we ex
pected of them, and all that men
could do by sincere and painstak
ing preparation. There was much
cause for satisfaction in the fact
that they were all three of them de
baters of the first rank. Though
one man was ranked ahead of them
by the award, we are proud of the
showing which they made individ
ually and as a team. Three better
men have never made a Carnot
team, nor could three more consci
entious workers for Stanford be put
forward as our representatives.
