We commend our Athletic Com
mittee for the firm stand they
took yesterday relative to the place
of holding the next intercollegiate
field-day. The time has come
when we must stand up for our
rights in the matter of intercolleg
iate contests. That Berkeley
should wilfully disregard the agree
ment to run off the track and field
events on our campus this year, in
return for our going to Berkeley
last spring, is sufficient evidence of
this. If ever claim had justice on
its side, ours has when we insist
that our display of good faith he
returned in kind. We feel sure

that when the question comes up
for consideration by the committee
to which it has been left, our con
tention will be upheld, and the
next field-day scheduled for Stan
ford University campus.
