# "IN THE STILLNESS."
## Professor Starbuck Delivers the Regular Sunday Sermon in the Chapel. 
### 
Professor Edwin D. Starbuck de
livered the sermon Sunday morn
ing on the subject, "In the Still
ness." In part he said: "All good
and abiding things grow. They
are not the work of a moment.
They are determined by perma
nent and abiding laws; not by
chance occurrences. These laws
work for the most part noiselessly
and persistently. In their opera
tion they are mostly hid from our
view. A month ago we saw a
sprout pushing its way silently
through the soil. Toda}' in the
same spot is a full-grown flower in
all its beauty and fragrance. How
the result came about we do not
know. The secret of it lies buried.
Most of the great things nature
does she accomplishes in this same
quiet way, growth of worlds, stor
ing up of energy, process of circula
tion or of digestion. If we do not
appreciate these physical trans
formations, no less ignorant are we
of every shade of psychical ten
dency which they accompany. Of
only the occasional and intermit
tent complex of nervous forces
which cause friction or tension or
especial resistance in a certain
brain area are we conscious. The
bulk of life lies hidden.
"Perhaps that picture which best
represents the make-up of a human
body is that of a floating body
mostly submerged. The part
emerged is the logical, rational,
conscious self. That below is con
tinuous with it, but differs only in
being excluded from the clear
course. With such an analogy, the
sum total of habits, instincts, im
pulses, and emotions, together with
the complex of passing sensations,
will constitute the hidden —the
buried self.
"Man is a bundle of habits. If
we subtract from our lives what
we get from our ancestors by hered
ity, together with what we pick up
from those about us, we have little
left. It is habit and tendencies
that make up personality. These
constitute the real self.
"The growth of life is in two di
rections —first, toward the enlarg
ment of the sphere of rational in
sight, and on the other hand, in
creasing in its complexity and fine
ness this indefinable stock of world
wiscom, of deeper intuition, of mo
tion, and purpose within, which
drive us, and sway us, and check
us. 1
"As 1 look at a great picture it is
not what I think of it that finds
me, but it is the manifoldness of
its parts that picture intoconsciouß
ness and finally possess me that
give it meaning, it is this life
within which is, with the average
person, the final and supreme au
thority in matters of conduct. He
does, at least, what his impulses,
his tastes, his desires dictate to
him.
"Our natures —our nervous sys
tems, are inconceivably sensitive
organs, that are not only register
ing but taking account of the im
pressions that come to them when
we are least aware of it. All the

sight and sound, all the vanishing
odors, all the impressions from per
sons and things about us, are rush
ing in upon and shaping our char
acters. Any ideas we entertain are
unconsciously expressing them
selves in appropriate movements,
any impulses or desires we are not
able to conceal. They tend imme
diately to pass into action. What
ever we have in us will out sooner
or later, in one way or another.
lAs a man thinketh in his breast
so is lie.' It is the silent forces
that tell. It is in the deedß of life
that character is forged. Our des
tinies are worked out during our
sleep and quiet musings, not in
our tragic moments. It is through
the ceaseless transformation of the
little things that we grow strong,
not the great things.
" We can to some degree choose
the things that are to influence us.
More saints have been created out
of the quiet and refined influence
of a church, the stirring, strength
giving power of music, than by all
the sermons that have been
preached. Each of us, as he
chooses his companions, chooses
the things that are to influence him.
Character must come by a constant
building. Deeds are the stones
out of which we build. We grow
as the plant grows. True, great
things break on the surface from
small causes. It doubtless be
cause we cannot see into them.
"We think that in youth we can
sow wild oats and later we can be
as the best man or the best woman
we know. But this is accomplished
only by a slow growth. We must
prepare for the crisis of life during
the quiet moments. We shall
some day meet temptation, and
may fall, but he whose life is per
fectly ordered when a crisis over
takes him will fall, if at all, toward
the gate of Heaven.
"We must plant the seed of truth
deep in the soil of mind and heart.
Having done this we must trust
this good seed to do its work in its
own way. Above all things, let us
not pull it up by the roots every
now and then to see how it is grow
ing. Let us remember that we
have just two things to do: to plant
the seed and to keep it provided
with proper nourishment and care,
and we may rest assured that if we
do our part the seed will do the
rest. One may ask what these
seeds are. They are our best deeds
or, to state it briefly, they are what
ever we expect to get out of life as
a final result. Our faithfulness in
little things are the seeds which
will grow to great things. One
needs to draw into the sacred re
cesses of his own soul, and happy
beyond measure is that one, who,
amid the hurry and crash of this
present life, possesses his soul in
quietness and simplicity."

we are least aware of it. All the

sight and sound, all the vanishing
odors, all the impressions from per
sons and things about us, are rush
ing in upon and shaping our char
acters. Any ideas we entertain are
unconsciously expressing them
selves in appropriate movements,
any impulses or desires we are not
able to conceal. They tend imme
diately to pass into action. What
ever we have in us will out sooner
or later, in one way or another.
lAs a man thinketh in his breast
so is lie.' It is the silent forces
that tell. It is in the deedß of life
that character is forged. Our des
tinies are worked out during our
sleep and quiet musings, not in
our tragic moments. It is through
the ceaseless transformation of the
little things that we grow strong,
not the great things.
" We can to some degree choose
the things that are to influence us.
More saints have been created out
of the quiet and refined influence
of a church, the stirring, strength
giving power of music, than by all
the sermons that have been
preached. Each of us, as he
chooses his companions, chooses
the things that are to influence him.
Character must come by a constant
building. Deeds are the stones
out of which we build. We grow
as the plant grows. True, great
things break on the surface from
small causes. It doubtless be
cause we cannot see into them.
"We think that in youth we can
sow wild oats and later we can be
as the best man or the best woman
we know. But this is accomplished
only by a slow growth. We must
prepare for the crisis of life during
the quiet moments. We shall
some day meet temptation, and
may fall, but he whose life is per
fectly ordered when a crisis over
takes him will fall, if at all, toward
the gate of Heaven.
"We must plant the seed of truth
deep in the soil of mind and heart.
Having done this we must trust
this good seed to do its work in its
own way. Above all things, let us
not pull it up by the roots every
now and then to see how it is grow
ing. Let us remember that we
have just two things to do: to plant
the seed and to keep it provided
with proper nourishment and care,
and we may rest assured that if we
do our part the seed will do the
rest. One may ask what these
seeds are. They are our best deeds
or, to state it briefly, they are what
ever we expect to get out of life as
a final result. Our faithfulness in
little things are the seeds which
will grow to great things. One
needs to draw into the sacred re
cesses of his own soul, and happy
beyond measure is that one, who,
amid the hurry and crash of this
present life, possesses his soul in
quietness and simplicity."
Professor Edwin D. Starbuck de
livered the sermon Sunday morn
ing on the subject, "In the Still
ness." In part he said: "All good
and abiding things grow. They
are not the work of a moment.
They are determined by perma
nent and abiding laws; not by
chance occurrences. These laws
work for the most part noiselessly
and persistently. In their opera
tion they are mostly hid from our
view. A month ago we saw a
sprout pushing its way silently
through the soil. Toda}' in the
same spot is a full-grown flower in
all its beauty and fragrance. How
the result came about we do not
know. The secret of it lies buried.
Most of the great things nature
does she accomplishes in this same
quiet way, growth of worlds, stor
ing up of energy, process of circula
tion or of digestion. If we do not
appreciate these physical trans
formations, no less ignorant are we
of every shade of psychical ten
dency which they accompany. Of
only the occasional and intermit
tent complex of nervous forces
which cause friction or tension or
especial resistance in a certain
brain area are we conscious. The
bulk of life lies hidden.
"Perhaps that picture which best
represents the make-up of a human
body is that of a floating body
mostly submerged. The part
emerged is the logical, rational,
conscious self. That below is con
tinuous with it, but differs only in
being excluded from the clear
course. With such an analogy, the
sum total of habits, instincts, im
pulses, and emotions, together with
the complex of passing sensations,
will constitute the hidden —the
buried self.
"Man is a bundle of habits. If
we subtract from our lives what
we get from our ancestors by hered
ity, together with what we pick up
from those about us, we have little
left. It is habit and tendencies
that make up personality. These
constitute the real self.
"The growth of life is in two di
rections —first, toward the enlarg
ment of the sphere of rational in
sight, and on the other hand, in
creasing in its complexity and fine
ness this indefinable stock of world
wiscom, of deeper intuition, of mo
tion, and purpose within, which
drive us, and sway us, and check
us. 1
"As 1 look at a great picture it is
not what I think of it that finds
me, but it is the manifoldness of
its parts that picture intoconsciouß
ness and finally possess me that
give it meaning, it is this life
within which is, with the average
person, the final and supreme au
thority in matters of conduct. He
does, at least, what his impulses,
his tastes, his desires dictate to
him.
"Our natures —our nervous sys
tems, are inconceivably sensitive
organs, that are not only register
ing but taking account of the im
pressions that come to them when
we are least aware of it. All the

sight and sound, all the vanishing
odors, all the impressions from per
sons and things about us, are rush
ing in upon and shaping our char
