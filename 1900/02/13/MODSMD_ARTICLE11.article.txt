A movement is being agitated to
erect a monument on the campus
to the Stanford men who fell dur
ing the war. The precedent has
been set by similar actions taken
by Eastern universities, and, while
the volunteers are chiefly active in
discussing the matter, it is some
thing in which every Stanford stu
dent can and will feel interested.
Three, of the many Stanford men
who enlisted, lost their lives in bat
tle, and in their honor it is desired
to erect a memorial. This is a con
sideration distinct from the one
now in the hands of the student
body Executive Committee. Both
are undertakings which, started,
will undoubtedly receive the sup
port from the students which they
well deserve.
