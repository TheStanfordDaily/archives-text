The com promise of the graduate
coach question at the intercolleg
iate athletic committees' meeting
hy reducing the requisite to a four
years' attendance, is purely there

suit of Berkeley agitation against
the movement emanating from
Stanford to place intercollegiate
athletics upon a firmer basis of
scholarship. It has always been a
source of gratification to us that,
whether victorious or defeated, we
could point with pride to the fact
that our representatives have satis
fied university as well as athletic
regulations. Stanford has given
no place to imported athletes, nor
offered any inducements to men
who were unable to maintain their
university standing. It was thor
oughly in harmony with this spirit
that we advanced the proposition
for graduate coaches, believing that
it would certainly put university
athletics on a stronger basis to
have our coaches carry with them
a degree, as well as a knowledge of
football. We regret that a com
promise with athletic managements
less interested in maintaining re
quirements of scholarship has com
pelled us to retreat to the least de
gree from our position.
