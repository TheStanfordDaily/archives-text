# New Electric Lights.
## 
### 
The Peninsula Lighting Com
pany is again on the scene. The
men are now putting in the meters.

When the subject was first brought
up there was a good deal of objec
tion to the change. The rate was
higher and the meters were to be
put in. On account of the opposi
tion the rates were lowered from
cents to 14 cents per watt
hour. Even with this change in
rates many refuse to come under
the new system, wishing a fixed
rate, instead of having the power
measured. Under the new system,
there is advantage of having
the lights burn all night and all
day if desired.
The meters now being putin are
not permanent, but most of the
houses are taking them on trial
for the month to see how the light
and the expense compare with the
former system. They will be in
running order by Thursday or Fri
day night. The result of the ex
periment will decide whether or
not the new system will be univer
sally adopted.
