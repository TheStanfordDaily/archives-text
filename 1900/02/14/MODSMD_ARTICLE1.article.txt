# EXCHANGE CAMPUS GAMES.
## Each University to See Its Opponnent's Team in a Practical Game. 
### 
The baseball managers of Berke
ley and Stanford have arranged
for exchange campus games on
Saturday, the '24th of this month.
On that day Berkeley will cross
bats with the Santa Clara College
team on our campus, while the
•Varsity will play against the Fire
man's Fund team on the Berkeley
diamond. The California team
will come down under Stanford
management.
This game should be well pat
ronized as it gives Stanford men a
chance to see the kind of a game
Berkeley puts up. The contest
should be a close one as Berkeley,
so far this year, has had a better
record than Stanford, and the Santa
Clara team in past seasons has
always put up a stiff game against
the colleges.
Stanford will take a better team
to the Berkeley campus than the
one which met the Firemen last
week. The men will have the ad
vantage of an additional two weeks
hard practice, and will be rein
forced by Lanagan,who will occupy
the pitcher's box. The Firemen in
their last game did not put up as
good ball as when they played their
first scheduled game The men
were not up to -form and the team
work was not certain. The prac
tice will put them in better condi
tion also, and by Thursday after
noon both teams will meet in
proper fettle.
These exchange campus games
are a distinct advantage to both
Stanford and Berkeley. It gives
both teams an opportunity to judge
the respective diamonds before the
final intercollegiate matches, which
are to be played, one on the Berke
ley campus and the other on Stan
ford's grounds.
Van Haltren, the Berkeley coach,
was an old California League pitch
er. For the last four years, how
ever, he has been a member of the
New York Giants, playing in the
outfield. He is a player of the Bill
Lange style, fast, sure, and full of
ginger. He understands the game
in all its departments and with his
thorough knowledge he combines
the unusual quality of being able
to impart his wisdom to others. He
is coaching the Berkeley team to
play a game full of life, with every
player in the game from the first to
last inning. By Washington's
Birthday Van should have the Cal
ifornia colts in condition to play
the Santa Clarans off their feet.
Kaarsberg will be in the box, while
Warren Smith will be the receiving
end of the Blue and Gold battery.
Santa Clara can always be relied
upon to put up a fine article of
baseball. They have their usual
corps of veterans back at college.
"Mike Kelly," the south-paw won
der, who has proved a mystery for
the college teams around the bay
for the last half dozen years, will
do the pitching for the visitors
from San Jose.
Both teams are evenly balanced,
and the result of the game should
be in doubt for nine innings. In
form Berkeley should have a shade

the best of argument, due to Van
Haltren's coaching. The wearers of
the red and white are harder fight
ers than California, and this fight
ing spirit of theirs may offset the
superior team work of Berkeley
and win for Santa Clara.
