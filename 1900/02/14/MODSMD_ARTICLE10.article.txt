Now that the Carnot debate, so
far as the medal is concerned, is
lo√üt to Stanford for this year, our
debaters must prepare to capture
the regular intercollegiate debate
at all hazards. To do this will
take work, and work of the most
consistent kind. That our three
men in the contest last Friday
made a better showing, taken as a
whole, than did the representatives
of Berkeley, is sufficient to insure
on the part of California's speak
ers a concerted effort to win for the
Blue and Gold the one other foren
sic contest of this year. Today
Stanford would have no trouble in

defeating Berkeley in a debating
contest in which team was matched
against team; but today is not the
last of April, and between now and
that time Berkeley is sure to make
an improvement which will need
our best efforts to overcome. Our
only salvation is spirit and work,
and a determination on the part of
all eligible to the finale to make
the three students who are to be
chosen for our next team earn
their places in the face of the fierc
est competition.
