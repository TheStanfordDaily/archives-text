—F. A. Stevens, '01, has left the
UDiversity. He is at present in the
employ of the Warren Dredger
Company at San Mateo.
—A. E. Davis, '98, was at the
University yesterday. He is em
ployed as mine surveyor and as
sayer for a mine near Durango,
Mexico.
—P. C. Hatch, '99, visited the
University last Sunday. He is
connected with the engineering de
partment of the Southern Pacific
at Sacramento.
—An exceedingly simple and in
genious model, illustrating the act
ion of the Meyer valve-gear, has
just been designed and built by
Prof. A. W. Smith, for use in the
course on the steam-engine. The
underlying principle is capable of
application to the design of all
valve-gear models, and will greatly
simplify their construction.
—On last Saturday morning the
ElectricaljEngineering students vis
ited the Call building electric and
elevator power-house, where a de
tailed study of the equipment was
made. This is valuable as an ex
ample of modern practice in good
isolated plant engineering. The
party also visited the Edison Elec
tric Lighting Co.'s storage battery
installation and central station of
about 4000 horse-power, in which a
very profitable afternoon was
spent.
