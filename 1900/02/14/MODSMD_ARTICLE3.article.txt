# Sophomore Dance Arrangements.
## 
### 
The Sophomore Class has com
pleted the arrangements for their
annual dance to be given February
22d in Encina Hall. They have
made a new departure in deciding
upon a program of a regular order
of dances instead of the usual cotil
lion. This innovation ought to be
well received as the cotillion has
been somewhat unpopular with
university dance goers. There will
be twenty dances, four extras, a
'02 grab, and a "special stunt."
Just what this "special stunt" is,
the committee of arrangements are
discreetly keeping secret. They
say it will be new, novel, and pleas
ing.
Yank's orchestra, led by Yank
in person, will furnish the music
for the affair. The sophomores are
fortunate in getting Air. Yank to
lead. Refreshments will be served
in the lobby.
The patronesses are Mrs. Jordan,
Mrs. Stillman, Mrs. Murray, Mrs.
Wood, Mrs. Hudson, Mrs. Storey,
Mrs. Little, and Mrs. Fairclough.
