## Lieutenant Calkins Talks on Cromwell's Quest of Colonial Empire. 
### 
Lieutenant Commander C. G.
Calkins, U. S. N., navigating officer
of the Olympia at the battle of
Manila, lectured in the chapel last
night upon the subject, "Cromwell's
Quest of Colonial Empire." The
subject might have been announced
as the "Philippine Question," fo> it
required no extraordinary intelli
gence to perceive that Lieutenant
Calkins was using a very thin dis
guise in order to air his views on
that subject. Without referring to
the Philippines more than once or
twice during his discourse, he suc
ceeded in impressing his disap
proval of America's Eastern policy
upon his auditors.
The largest part of the lecture
was devoted to a resum6 of the his
tory of Cromwell's attempted col
onization of Jamaica. This at
tempt he showed to have been very
injurious to England.
"There is no need of a new esti
mate of Cromwell's character or
his place in history. It is time for
us to regard him as he really was,
with all his physical and moral
audacity, with all his tenderness
and spiritual yearning, in the world
of action what Shakspere was in
the world of thought—the greatest,
because the most typical English
man of his time.
"In spite of his exalted character
Cromwell's audacities were not al
ways inspired, and perhaps the
greatest of his mistakes was the
dream of world-empire which led
to the colonization of Jamaica.
Conservative critics used to reckon
the capture of this island and the
Navigation Acta as the only deeds
of Cromwell that could be men
tioned without censure. But there
have been changes in the estimate
of relative values.
"Of the 9700 soldiers sent out to
Jamaica only 8000 were landed,
owing to the costly mistakes of the
leaders of the expedition. Yet
they had never encountered more
than 300 Spaniards, nor had
they faced the assault of
trenches. Jamaica had only 1500
inhabitants with 500 soldiers, and
offered no organized resistance.
The Spaniards were required to de
liver over their slaves and goods but
most of them absconded. The
slaves ran wild and as niaroons
they harassed the English forag
ing parties. In taking possession
Penn declared that, 'He would not
trust the army with the attempt if
he could come near with his ships—
a sound maxim whenever an effic
ient fleet has to support a disorgan
ized army. As soon as the Span
iards had taken to the woods and
the 8000 miserable Englishmen had
been landed, the two generals sailed
for England—their only bold act
ion during this campaign. Upon
their return to England no time
was lost in sending Penn and Ven
ables to the Tower; each of them
was guilty of returning without li
cense and contrary to his trust.
After a while they were released,
but Oliver never trusted either of
them again.
"Sedgwick the most conscientious

governor of Jamaica, late found the
army in 'sad, deplorable, and dis
tracted condition. 1 see a vast ex
pense and treasure and no return —
no, none at all; and methinke I see
little will be.'
"Cromwell was so anxious to
keep the soldiers in a contented
frame of mind that he ordered his
son Henry to send out 1000 girls
from Ireland as wives for them.
'Concerning the girls,' Henry an
swered, 'although we have to use
force yet as it is for their own good,
they can be had in great abun
dance.' In spite of these strenuous
exertions the passing years proved
that Englishmen could not colonize
successfully in the tropics, and the
island proved a constant source of
anxiety. The slaves, wild and
tame, caused incessant anxiety to
the conquerors.
"The lesson to be learned from
this incident was confirmed by the
experience of Spain in the Philip
pines. If historic warnings are
needed, let us read Spanish Chron
icles. An Augustinian reporter of
1680 tried to balance the losses and
gains of two generations of militant
missions to the Filipinos. Against
the credit for redeemed souls he sets
down the cost of armadas and the
sacrifice of soldiers and friars.
From these incidents the lecturer
drew a lesson for America. "Her
success," he said, "began when
Massachusetts refused to help
Cromwell in his subjugation of Ja
maica, and it has been this consis
tent policy of non-expansion in the
tropics which has raised her to her
present proud position.
"Because New England has re
jected such sublimities she has won
more than Spain has lost in the
last three centuries. Because she
has refused to send her children to
lands where they cannot preserve
their character or plant her institu
tions, California is now r free com
monwealth instead of a crown col
ony like Jamaica."
