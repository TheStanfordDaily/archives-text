It was much regretted at last
evening's lecture that the lecturer
did not touch upon the subject
which we would have been more
interested to hear discussed, and
which he was so well qualified to
speak upon—the battle of Manila

proper place, it is nevertheless a
subject which we would prefer to
get from text-books, leaving to such
distinguished lecturers something
indelibly connected with their own
experience.
