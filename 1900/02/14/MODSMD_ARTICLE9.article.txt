The offer by the University to
the Students' Guild, of a room to be
fitted up for the use of women stu
dents, is something which will fill a
long-felt want in that direction.
Several years ago the Guild main
tained a similar room, which was
found to be of great value, particu
larly during the winter months. A
removal of the building compelled
an abandonment of the scheme,
and it has been only after consid
erable effort that a new room has
been obtained. The faculty ladies
who are carrying out the idea de
serve great credit for the interest
they thus show in the affairs of
women students.
