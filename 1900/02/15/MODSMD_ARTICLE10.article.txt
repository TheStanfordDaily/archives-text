At a meeting, this afternoon, of
the Executive Committee of the In
tercollegiate Debating League, an
action was taken that was emin
ently wise. It was the exemption
hereafter from participating in the
semi-finals of those debaters who
have been selected as alternates.
As we have taken occasion to point
out before, insistence that the alter
nates compete in semi-final con
tests is unjust to the alternates, as
well as indicative of our lack of ap
preciation of their services. The
only unfortunate thing about the
ruling is that it will have no effect
this year. It will go over to next
season, however, as an action taken
after mature deliberation, a deliber
ation which considered the injus
tice of the old system and the op
portunities for the new. As such,
it cannot but receive the hearty en
dorsement of future committees.
