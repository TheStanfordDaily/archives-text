The announcement from Berke
ley that they have ratified their in
tercollegiate committee's agreement
to stand by the award of an impar
tial board of arbitrators in the
matter of the new athletic proposi
tions, is received with considerable
satisfaction by all who have af
firmed the belief that true intercol
legiate sportsmanship would, in the
end, prevail. When the new regu
lations were first proposed, there
was evidenced a determined oppo
sition to innovations seeking to
place athletics on a firmer univer
sity basis. To obtain this end,
Stanford proposed a system of
graduate coaches, but was met with
a counter-feeling to maintain the
old system, or, at least, to establish
a requisite of but one or two years'
attendance. Similarly we declared
that the annual field-day would
this year be held on the Stanford
campus, in conformity with a
former agreement, or would not be

held iit all. In order that a de
plenished treasury might be as
sisted, however, the University of
California entirely repudiated the
agreement which her accredited
managers had officially made, and
insisted that one side of the agree
ment he repeated, instead of a mu
tual performance. Through the
conflict of these ideas, what seemed
to be a controversy impossible of
settlement arose. Some even feared
that the pursuit of motives of such
indifferent athletic fairness and
sportsmanship would lead to a de
feat of any innovations, and even
a dissolution of former agreements.
This decision to abide by arbitra
tion, however, removes the danger
of such an outcome, and assures a
fair settlement of the controversies.
The side which has mere fairness
and a determination to insist only
upon its own rights upon its side,
has no cause to fear the results.
