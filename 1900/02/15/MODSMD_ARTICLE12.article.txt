Dr. Angell of the Psychological
department has a review in the cur
rent number of the American Jour
nal of Psychology of a work recently
published in Leipsic, "Zur Analyse
der Unterschiedsemfindlichkeit."
The main part of the work is by
Miss Lillie J. Martin, acting head
of the Psychological department
here during Dr. Angell's absence.
She was assisted in her investiga
tions by G. E. Mueller. Dr. An
gell, in his article, states that as a
whole the work contains material
enough for half a dozen arbeits.
The main purpose of the book,
as pointed out in the preface, is
"by means of criticism to contri
bute something towards dispelling
the illusion that the complicated
and difficult province of pyschology
is peculiarly that in which one can
further scientific knowledge with a
minimum outfit of acquirements
and training."
Dr. Angell says that notwith
standing the many factors analyzed
out by Miss Martin and Professor
Mueller, the reader never feels that
he is on shaky ground, partly be
cause the results agree when looked
at from different standpoints, and
partly because the conclusions hit
in with common-sense views.
In concluding his review, Dr.
Angell says that the work is as un
commonly hard to read as it is un
commonly rich in acute and sound
psychological analysis.
