# Agrees to Arbitration.

### 
The students' athletic committee
at Berkeley decided last night to
stand by any decision which the
outside committee, selected at last
Saturday's meeting, may make
concerning the holding of the field
day and the question of graduate
coaches. The differences between
the athletic committees of the two
universities lie in the inability to
agree on whether the field-day shall
be held here or in Berkeley, and as
to the time a man must have been
in college to be eligible as a foot
ball coach. These questions will
be settled by an outside committee
consisting of Professor Bacon of
Berkeley, Professor Richardson of
Stanford, and John Elliott of the
Olympic Club.
