San Jose is preparing a big wel
come for the Stanford musicians
tomorrow night. The concert,
which has been well advertised, will
be given in the theater and ball
room of the Vendome hotel and
will be followed by a dancing
party arranged by the society peo
ple in honor of the clubs. The an
nual concert in San Jose has
always been an important musical
and social event, but this year it
promises to be more successful than
ever. The program will be the
same as used on the southern
tour and given in the Assembly
Hall this semester. It is entirely
new to San Jose and is of a quality
that is sure to please. Riley, Cor

busier, and Olshausen, the clubs'
clever trio of entertainers, will ap
pear and both clubs are in condi
tion to do their best work. A
number of college people will leave
the campus tomorrow afternoon for
San Jose to help make the Stan
ford night a success. The clubs go
by a bus which leaves the campus
at one o'clock and the Palo Alto
station at one thirty.
