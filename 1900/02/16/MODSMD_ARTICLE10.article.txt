### 
The Harvard graduates of New
York have decided to give an ad
ditional $15,000 toward the con
struction of the new university
boathouse, which is to take the
jilace of the one recently destroyed
by fire in the course of construc
tion. This amount, in addition to
the insurance received on the old
building, will bring the total cost
of the new structure to $43,000.
