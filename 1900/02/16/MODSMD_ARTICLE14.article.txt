The announcement that the
Berkeley and Stanford Glee and
Mandolin Clubs have arranged for
exchange concerts comes with much
pleasure to the musical patrons of
both universities. There is nothing
so interesting as comparison, and
the mere fact of being able to see
and hear the clubs of the Univer
sity of California is sure to fill the
assembly hall on the evening of the
concert. The managements are to
be commended for the interest and
initiative they have shown. We
predict that their efforts will be
fully appreciated when the oppor
tunity is given us of hearing the
combination concert.
