Work on the 1901 Quad is prog
ressing satisfactorily, but the hook
is not far enough along at present
to allow of a full account of it. Ed
itor Langnecker says that the only
difficulty he has encountered has
been in getting in copy from some
of the organizations who have de
sired space in the Annual. This
has delayed the management to a
certain extent, as, until the copy is
in, they cannot tell accurately how
much space to allot to it.
The Quad is to be arranged in
books, each department represented
constituting one book, it is ex
pected that in size this year's An
nual will be larger than that of last
year, but it is impossible as yet to
give the exact size. The art de
partment promises to be exception
ally good.
