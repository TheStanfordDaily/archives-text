# AGRICULTURAL LECTURES.
## Three Interesting Talks and a Large Attendance Mark the First Day. 
### 
The lectures for fruit-growers
which the instructors of the Ento
mology department have planned
for this week commenced this
morning at 11:15 in the law library.
The attendance was satisfactory in
every way. There were here today
about seventy-five people, and the
attendance will likely increase din
ing the week. The men who
planned the course are pleased at
the interest shown, and at the num
ber here so early in the week.
President Jordan opened the
meeting with an informal talk on
"The University and the Fruit
grower." The university, he said,
has four general missions: first, to
drill —to take hold of students and
teach them how to find out truths
for themselves; second — to create,
and by inspiration to stir up
thought; third, to investigate.
Teachers instruct through investi
gation. The farmer, the fruit
grower has not the time nor means
to investigate for himself. He is
forced to trust what he sees or feels
and cannot get at the bottom of
things. He observes that his fruit
is dying, but knows not what to
do. As a natural result, he be
comes the prey of the quack, and
thousands of dollars are wasted
that might otherwise be saved.
Here the university can help the
farmer, for its fourth aim is to help.
Our business is to discriminate, to
investigate. We have the instru
ments of precision with which to
deal with the horticulturalists' en
emies."
Continuing, Dr. Jordan pointed
out some of the different ways in
which the university can be of
value to the farmer. "The intend
ing producer," he said, "sometimes
makes a mistake in his choice of
soils. I have advised Easterners
never to buy land in Cal
ifornia without first inspecting it.
California soil is of a different na
ture from that in the East. Uni
versity scientific methods can by
analysis aid the horticulturist in
the matter."
Dr. Jordan went on to say that
there are problems in irrigation, in
the growth of plants, and the laws
of heredity, and that here the uni
versity can put its resources at the
growers' service. Entomology not
only deals with those insects known
to be injurious, but all insects.
The greatest discoveries come from
unexpected sources. The speaker
protested against the wholesale
slaughter of birds as a menace to
the orchardists'success. Although
they are invaluable allies in the
war against the insect pests, yet in
the last fifteen years their number
has decreased 40 per cent.
In conclusion Dr. Jordan pointed
out the way the university can
help the fruit growers in the solu
tion of their economic problems.
At 1:30 this afternoon Professor
F. A. Fetter of the Economics de
partment spoke on "The Growth
of Markets."
"A market," he says, "is not a
place, but a group of buyers and
sellers. The influences at work are

communication and transportation.
The closer the communication the
larger the market. Every improve
ment that tends to bring the pro
ducer and the consumer nearer to
gether will tend to better the mar
ket. Markets are of four classes:
Local, provincial, national, and
world. This last never has ex
isted; it is ideal. The search for
market is the characteristic thing
in industry."
Continuing in this line, Dr. Fet
ter rapidly reviewed the history of
commerce and incidentally found
an argument against expansion in
the conditions present in colonial
trade. Where it costs more than
a dollar to do a dollar's worth of
business, trade cannot be very
lucrative. Moreover, the largest
trade is carried 011 between civil
ized countries. In 1897 we ex
ported to Europe fifty times as
much as we did to the Philippines.
And Europe stands ready today to
import our goods, but our policy
makes commerce difficult. We
want to trade, but will not take
what Europe has to offer in pay
ment. Here California may learn
a lesson. We must accept from
the East what the East has to ex
change for our fruits."
The third lecture of the day was
delivered by Professor Comstock,
on "Insect Life." The talk was
somewhat in the nature of an in
troduction to the lectures which
Professor Woodworth of the Uni
versity of California and H. W.
Torchiana of Los Banos will give
later in the week. In view of the
fact that the fruit-growers should
know something of the physical
character of the pests with which
they have to deal, he explained
some of the peculiarities of some of
the more common insects, illustra
ting his remarks by charts and by
blackboard drawing.
After the lecture specimens were
exhibited illustrating the structure
and metamorphoses of insects.
