The excursion on Washington's
birthday on the occasion of the
Fireman's Fund game should
attract a larger number of visitors
than usual, due to the fact that it
is a legal holiday and can be taken
advantage of by a great many.
It would seem advisable that some
preparation should be made to re
ceive the visitors by the student
body, and also that the affair
should be advertised as extensively
as possible. If we are to have cam
pus games, and it is certain that
we are, just such excursions as
these will draw attention to our
campus and make it easier to bring
crowds to the intercollegiate events.
