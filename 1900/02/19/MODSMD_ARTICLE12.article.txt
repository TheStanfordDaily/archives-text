The last of the inter-class base
ball games has taken place, leaving

Students get tired of watching
practice day after day, and nothing
can be better to maintain their
active interest than an actual con
test to vary the monotony. Cam
pus games, as far as financially
practical, certainly justify them
selves as often as they can be held.
