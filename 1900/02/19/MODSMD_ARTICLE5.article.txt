# Arbitration Committee.
## 
### 
Word has been received that Pro
fessor Bacon of the University of
California will not consent to serve
as its representative on the board of
arbitrators appointed by the inter
collegiate athletic committees. Pro
fessor Richardson, Stanford's repre
sentative, when seen today said
that he had no information as to
what course would be taken or
when the arbitrators were to meet.
It is not altogether improbable that
the athletic controversies will yet
be settled without the aid of arbi
tration.
