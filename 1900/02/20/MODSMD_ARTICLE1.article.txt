# ORCHARDISTS' MEETINGS.
## University Instructors and Fruit Men Give Practical Talks on Fruit-Growers' Problems. 
### 
The second day lectures to the
fruit growers opened with a good
attendance. President Jordan lec
tured at 10:15 a.m. on "The Selec
tion of New Forms of Fruit." After
a few preliminary remarks, he be
gan by stating that if all the do
mesticated fruits were destroyed we
could reproduce them all from the
wild forms. "We have in selection
and crossing," lie continued, "the
means of doing this. It is Ihe ma
gician's wand; the creator of new
forms. One can chalk on the wall
a sheep, or a pumpkin, or a prune,
and produce them by breeding. To
begin at bottom: plants and ani
mals both start as a single cell and
the plan is in the nucleus, which
alone determines what the adult
form will be. Cells conjugate, that
is, two cells meet and part of the
nucleus of one exchanges with the
other. This produces variation.
The purpose of sex is to produce
variation, and it is the reason why
no two things are alike in the uni
verse Ingrowth cells divide and
stick together, and continue this
operation until the mass of cells
take form and develop into the
animal or plant required by the
plan in the nucleus. But the divis
ion of germ cells is never exactly
equal, so no two pollen grains or
ovules in fiowers are ever alike, so
there is a perfect mechanical ad
justment in nature to produce va
riation.
' In planting seedling trees no
two are alike and either the male
or female parent is unknown. In
protected breeding, however, both
parents may be known. As an ex
ample of natural development, the
walnut is made of leaves which
have folded over a kernel, or egg,
to protect it, until the habit has be
come fixed. We have two elements
in the formation of new growths.
We select the ones we desire and
plant their seeds, but destroy the
others. If you want a tree with
large meated or large shelled nuts,
then select the finest meated or
largest shelled seeds for planting.
In this way growers have produced
seedless oranges, grapes, apples,
pears. These trees are reproduced
by grafting, and have no power of
voluntary generation.
"In the first place for hybridism,
the plants must not be too far
apart, too much unlike, for other
wise the offsprings will not be fer
tile. For instance, you can not
cross a pine tree and an apple
tree and get a pineapple. While
dogs are descended from wolves, the
latter have qualities which make
them undesirable as lap pets,
though on the other hand by arti
ficial selection in Mexico, dogs have
been developed from the wolves
there until they are about a foot
long, hairless, and so weak that if
you pinch their tails their eyes
bulge out.
"Thus while a horse and donkey
will cross readily, a mule cannot
produce an offspring. The same
holds true with plants. A straw
berry and raspberry will cross and
produce fertile offspring, but a

peach and an apple will not pro
duce a hybrid that is fertile. So
this selected breeding must be con
fined to near relatives. In walnuts
the little English nut and the large
Bijou French nut were crossed and
eventually a nut was secured that
combines the original virtues of
both, being large, hardy, and of
fine quality of meat. By the same
process the best variety of prunes
are produced.
"Of the two operations of hybrid
ism and selection, selection is the
most important as it can be carried
on continually. But both pro
cesses are in their infancy. While
there are many failures and degen
eration, the ultimate result is bene
ficial to the fruit-growers. By this
plan of domestic selection our most
useful animals and highest plants
have been secured."
E. M. Ehrhorn, the entomologist
for Santa Clara county, followed
Dr. Jordan. His subject was the
fighting of insect pests, and bis
paper was of much practical bene
fit to fruit-growers. Among other
tilings he said: "Twenty years
ago California fruit-growers made
the first attempt to fight insects,
and since then much progress has
been made in the work. The San
Jose scale, which is now considered
a Japanese insect, is our worst
pest. It has been treated with
various washes, with varying suc
cess, till finally the discovery was
made that the lady-bird was feeding
on the scale and rapidly destroying
it. In time the scale almost en
tirely disappeared.
"A second menace to the fruit
industry is the black olive scale,
which in citrus regions has been
successfully treated with hydrocy
anic acid. A wash of crude petro
leum is being tried at present for
this pest. Another evil is the pear
scale, which is perhaps best treated
with a solution of caustic soda, or
a wash of crude oil.
"But the worst pest that the or
chardist has to deal with is the
peach-tree borer. For this insect a
treatment of carbon bisulphide
fumes has been found good,
although in some cases the trees
were killed, while in others no in
jury was noticed. The best results
were obtained by painting the trees
with a wash of gas tar. Gas tar
has been condemned in this State,
but I have tried it on trees girdled
by gophers, with no apparent in
jury to the trees.
" Among the fruit-growers' ene
mies are th" cotton worm, which
succumbs to Paris-green; the many
caterpillars, the cankerworm, the
cutworm, and others. Many of
these may be destroyed by trap
ping, poisoning, and by destroying
their eggs. Vineyardists find their
chief enemy in the vine hopper. It
has been claimed that green alfalfa,
placed on the vines, will drive these
insects away.
"The United States leads the
world in scientific insect destruc
tion and California leads the United
States, but the science is only i 11 its
infancy. What are we to do in the
future? Thousands of dollars have
been spent to no purpose for lack
of system. To remedy this each
fruit-grower should see to it that he
kills no insect till he is sure what

it is. Often, in killing unknown
insects, we are killing our best
friends. Then nature study should
be taught in the schools, and scien
tific investigations should be en
couraged in every possible way."
After the regular paper, a short
discussion was held and some sam
ples of various insects were exam
ined. Professor Comstock also gave
a short talk during this period, on
the results of the investigations con
cerning borers conducted by the
Cornell Experiment Station. It was
found that a few old, neglected
peach trees formed a veritable hot
bed for breeding borers, and that a
casing of wire netting around the
trunk of the trees did more harm
than good.
In the afternoon 11. W. Tochiana
of Los Banos spoke on the "County
Bank and its Relation to the Horti
culturists." Me gave the history of
banking, showing how modern
banking was developed from the
early Lombard system. He told
of the sphere of the country bank,
bow it must operate in the com
munity where it does business and
keep in close connection with the
people. He said in part: "In start
ing a bank one must have good se
curity—at least $100,000. A good
manager is an essential figure in a
bank; he must be acquainted with
the existing conditions of the com
munity and use judgment in issu
ing loans on real estate. The rate
of interest in a country bank is al
ways greater than in a city bank,
because more money is exchanged
in a city bank and they are not
compelled to depend on the crops
for security. City banks have quit
lending money on country real
estate as security, as they have
lost so much money in former years
in this way. Landed property
makes very poor security, on ac
count of the changing value of land
and crops, caused by droughts and
pests."
Professor Comstock spoke at 2:30
on "The Balance of Nature." He
said in part:
"If all the acorns produced in
this valley in a single year were to
develop into oaks, there would be
room for no other trees; but the
number of oaks remains about the
same. There is a caterpillar that
feeds on the foliage of these oaks,
which would soon outnumber the
leaves of the oaks if all its young
developed. But the two species,
the plant and the insect, live side
by side without either attaining the
supremacy. But over a large part of
this valley man has supplanted the
natural flora with fields of grain
and orchards.
"A practical question now arises:
Can these orchards and grainfields
be maintained, or are they to be
swept away by natural forces
agiiinst which man is powerless?"
Professor Comstock then went on
to give a practical talk on the
natural forces that tend to the de
struction of plants, and in conclu
sion described the appearance and
habits of various predaceous in
sects and insect parasites.
The second day lectures to the
fruit growers opened with a good

"A second menace to the fruit
industry is the black olive scale,
which in citrus regions has been
successfully treated with hydrocy
anic acid. A wash of crude petro
leum is being tried at present for
this pest. Another evil is the pear
scale, which is perhaps best treated
with a solution of caustic soda, or
a wash of crude oil.
"But the worst pest that the or
chardist has to deal with is the
peach-tree borer. For this insect a
treatment of carbon bisulphide
fumes has been found good,
although in some cases the trees
were killed, while in others no in
jury was noticed. The best results
were obtained by painting the trees
with a wash of gas tar. Gas tar
has been condemned in this State,
but I have tried it on trees girdled
by gophers, with no apparent in
jury to the trees.
" Among the fruit-growers' ene
mies are th" cotton worm, which
succumbs to Paris-green; the many
caterpillars, the cankerworm, the
cutworm, and others. Many of
these may be destroyed by trap
ping, poisoning, and by destroying
their eggs. Vineyardists find their
chief enemy in the vine hopper. It
has been claimed that green alfalfa,
placed on the vines, will drive these
insects away.
"The United States leads the
world in scientific insect destruc
tion and California leads the United
States, but the science is only i 11 its
infancy. What are we to do in the
future? Thousands of dollars have
been spent to no purpose for lack
of system. To remedy this each
fruit-grower should see to it that he
kills no insect till he is sure what

it is. Often, in killing unknown
insects, we are killing our best
friends. Then nature study should
be taught in the schools, and scien
tific investigations should be en
couraged in every possible way."
After the regular paper, a short
discussion was held and some sam
ples of various insects were exam
ined. Professor Comstock also gave
a short talk during this period, on
the results of the investigations con
cerning borers conducted by the
Cornell Experiment Station. It was
found that a few old, neglected
peach trees formed a veritable hot
bed for breeding borers, and that a
casing of wire netting around the
trunk of the trees did more harm
than good.
In the afternoon 11. W. Tochiana
of Los Banos spoke on the "County
Bank and its Relation to the Horti
culturists." Me gave the history of
banking, showing how modern
banking was developed from the
early Lombard system. He told
of the sphere of the country bank,
bow it must operate in the com
munity where it does business and
keep in close connection with the
people. He said in part: "In start
ing a bank one must have good se
curity—at least $100,000. A good
manager is an essential figure in a
bank; he must be acquainted with
the existing conditions of the com
munity and use judgment in issu
ing loans on real estate. The rate
of interest in a country bank is al
ways greater than in a city bank,
because more money is exchanged
in a city bank and they are not
compelled to depend on the crops
for security. City banks have quit
lending money on country real
estate as security, as they have
lost so much money in former years
in this way. Landed property
makes very poor security, on ac
count of the changing value of land
and crops, caused by droughts and
pests."
Professor Comstock spoke at 2:30
on "The Balance of Nature." He
said in part:
"If all the acorns produced in
this valley in a single year were to
develop into oaks, there would be
room for no other trees; but the
number of oaks remains about the
same. There is a caterpillar that
feeds on the foliage of these oaks,
which would soon outnumber the
leaves of the oaks if all its young
developed. But the two species,
the plant and the insect, live side
by side without either attaining the
supremacy. But over a large part of
this valley man has supplanted the
natural flora with fields of grain
and orchards.
"A practical question now arises:
Can these orchards and grainfields
be maintained, or are they to be
swept away by natural forces
agiiinst which man is powerless?"
Professor Comstock then went on
to give a practical talk on the
natural forces that tend to the de
struction of plants, and in conclu
sion described the appearance and
habits of various predaceous in
sects and insect parasites.
The second day lectures to the
fruit growers opened with a good
attendance. President Jordan lec
tured at 10:15 a.m. on "The Selec
tion of New Forms of Fruit." After
a few preliminary remarks, he be
gan by stating that if all the do
mesticated fruits were destroyed we
could reproduce them all from the
wild forms. "We have in selection
and crossing," lie continued, "the
means of doing this. It is Ihe ma
gician's wand; the creator of new
forms. One can chalk on the wall
a sheep, or a pumpkin, or a prune,
and produce them by breeding. To
begin at bottom: plants and ani
mals both start as a single cell and
the plan is in the nucleus, which
alone determines what the adult
form will be. Cells conjugate, that
is, two cells meet and part of the
nucleus of one exchanges with the
other. This produces variation.
The purpose of sex is to produce
variation, and it is the reason why
no two things are alike in the uni
verse Ingrowth cells divide and
stick together, and continue this
operation until the mass of cells
take form and develop into the
animal or plant required by the
plan in the nucleus. But the divis
ion of germ cells is never exactly
equal, so no two pollen grains or
ovules in fiowers are ever alike, so
there is a perfect mechanical ad
justment in nature to produce va
riation.
' In planting seedling trees no
two are alike and either the male
or female parent is unknown. In
protected breeding, however, both
parents may be known. As an ex
ample of natural development, the
walnut is made of leaves which
have folded over a kernel, or egg,
to protect it, until the habit has be
come fixed. We have two elements
in the formation of new growths.
We select the ones we desire and
plant their seeds, but destroy the
others. If you want a tree with
large meated or large shelled nuts,
then select the finest meated or
largest shelled seeds for planting.
In this way growers have produced
seedless oranges, grapes, apples,
pears. These trees are reproduced
by grafting, and have no power of
voluntary generation.
"In the first place for hybridism,
the plants must not be too far
apart, too much unlike, for other
wise the offsprings will not be fer
tile. For instance, you can not
cross a pine tree and an apple
tree and get a pineapple. While
dogs are descended from wolves, the
latter have qualities which make
them undesirable as lap pets,
though on the other hand by arti
ficial selection in Mexico, dogs have
been developed from the wolves
there until they are about a foot
long, hairless, and so weak that if
you pinch their tails their eyes
bulge out.
"Thus while a horse and donkey
will cross readily, a mule cannot
produce an offspring. The same
holds true with plants. A straw
berry and raspberry will cross and
produce fertile offspring, but a

peach and an apple will not pro
duce a hybrid that is fertile. So
this selected breeding must be con
fined to near relatives. In walnuts
the little English nut and the large
Bijou French nut were crossed and
eventually a nut was secured that
combines the original virtues of
both, being large, hardy, and of
fine quality of meat. By the same
process the best variety of prunes
are produced.
"Of the two operations of hybrid
ism and selection, selection is the
most important as it can be carried
on continually. But both pro
cesses are in their infancy. While
there are many failures and degen
eration, the ultimate result is bene
ficial to the fruit-growers. By this
plan of domestic selection our most
useful animals and highest plants
have been secured."
E. M. Ehrhorn, the entomologist
for Santa Clara county, followed
Dr. Jordan. His subject was the
fighting of insect pests, and bis
paper was of much practical bene
fit to fruit-growers. Among other
tilings he said: "Twenty years
ago California fruit-growers made
the first attempt to fight insects,
and since then much progress has
been made in the work. The San
Jose scale, which is now considered
a Japanese insect, is our worst
pest. It has been treated with
various washes, with varying suc
cess, till finally the discovery was
made that the lady-bird was feeding
on the scale and rapidly destroying
it. In time the scale almost en
tirely disappeared.
