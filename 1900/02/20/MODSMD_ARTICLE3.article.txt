# The 						San Jose Concert.
## 
### 
The annual concert by the musi
cal clubs in San Jose has always
been well patronized and considered
one of the leading events of the
year, both musically and socially,
but all previous successes were
eclipsed by this season's concert,
which took place Friday evening at
the Vendome hotel. In point of
attendance and quality of program
it compared with any entertain
ment given on the tour this year.
The society people who had the
affair in charge presented the clubs
with an audience which completely
filled the large ball room. It was
the largest audience the clubs have
so far played to in San Jose, and
perhaps the most appreciative one,
as the program was enthusiastically
encored from first to last. A danc
ing party followed the program.
The receipts of the concert were
$190.75 and, as the expenses were
slight, the clubs have again sub
tracted a good sum from their
deficit.
