Considerable disturbance is
continually being occasioned by
people entering classes late, as, for
instance, in the class of evolution.
Many of these offenders are not
students, but whether they are or
not they should understand that
they are the cause of much annoy
ance, both to the instructors and to
the members of the classes. Visit
ors are always cordially welcome
to classes but they should remem
ber that they are just as cordially
requested to be on time.
