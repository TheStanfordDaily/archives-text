The success of the arrange
ment for exchanging baseball
games with Berkeley will depend
largely upon the student body.
On Saturday afternoon the Berke
ley and Santa Clara teams will
play on our campus, while Stan
ford and the Fireman's Fund play
across the bay. The proceeds of
the game here belong to Stanford
and those of the other contest to
Berkeley. Not alone for this rea
son is it desirous of securing a
good attendance at the game, but
in order to make the exchange
game a permanent and desirable
feature of college sports. It is a
proceeding in line with the late
athletic agreements, and Stanford
should give the visiting teams such
a reception as will reflect well upon
our student body and make the
teams desirous of coming again.
