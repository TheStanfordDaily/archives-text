The Sunday sermon was deliv
ered in the chapel by Rev. McH.
Wallace of Oakland. He spoke
on the subject, ''Every man must
work out his own salvation," and
said in part: "Since the days of
our fathers the word 'salvation'
has taken a great place in the
Christian world. Men have be
lieved in an absented God between
whose existence in Heaven and the
life of man 011 earth there was a
great gulf. St. Paul has treated of
an entirely different God —One who
looks for the perfecting of his son
and the time when all men should
appear in his likeness.
''There are laws governing the
ways of God as well as those of
men. One of the most important
of these is in regard to the necessity
of use for the continuance of life.
The Indian devotee who continu
ally holds his arm in a horizontal
position in mistaken religious zeal
soon loses all use of it. The an
cestor of the hermit crab found
that by taking the shell of another
animal he could be protected by a
defense much stronger than his
own; if you examine his descend
ant you will find but a sorry excuse
for the original crab. So it is with
one who sings, 'Jesus paid it all,'
and thinks that there is nothing
left for him to do. In the intel
lectual life the same principle ap
plies.
"Thus it is in those matters
which we call distinctly religious
and spiritual, one works out his own
salvation. We pray ' more peace,'
' more holiness.' But we need to
remember that robes are not tailor
made in heaven; each man must by
his own efforts make his own robe.
"We read that life is God. Life
is rather opportunity. When Abra
ham Lincoln signed the emancipa
tion proclamation some of the slaves
thought that they were going to
possess their masters' houses and
property. But they soon found
that liberty meant simply oppor
tunity and the privilege to work
out their own salvation.
" Let us develop life by loving
service. Some say ' The world owes
me a living and I am bound to have
it.' Contrast this with the spirit of
St. Paul who said, 'I am debtor
both to the Jew and the Greek,' and
'The greatest of these is charity.'
"In conclusion, the great thought
is, that we are not alone, but God
works with us. If I were to tell
you that each must work out his
salvation by himself it would bean
abandoned gospel, for St. Paul says
'We are not alone, for God works
with us.'"
