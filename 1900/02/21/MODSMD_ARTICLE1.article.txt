# THIRD DAY'S LECTURES.
## Practical Talks Given to the Orchardists by University Instructors. 
### 
Professor J. C. Branner gave the
first lecture this morning, on "Soils
in California." After giving a short
introduction upon the formation of
different varieties of rock, he said:
"The part of the crust of the earth
which farmers care for is the soil,
hut the geologists have no use for
this, and would like to have all of
it washed away so that they might
see the hard rock underneath. As
it is they must be content, to exam
ine those which project out of the
soil. In the beginning all the
earth was a molten mass, and in
cooling the different elements have
separated themselves so that in
stead of finding a little of all chem
icals in each rock you pick up, you
are apt to tind it to contain but one
chemical.
"All rocks decay, and a rock can
not be found which will not do so
when exposed to the weather. The
temperature has much to do with
this process. The heat of day ex
pands the rock and the cold of
night contracts it. The toughest
flint will not remain intact under
this treatment. The rain washes
the debris into the low places and
thus forms the soils, these latter
varying as the rocks."
The speaker then gave a practi
cal talk on the nature of different
soils, and dwelt on the good results
to soils brought about by the bur
rowing of animals.
Mrs. A. B. Comstock followed
Professor Branner, and spoke upon
the " Relations Between Nature
Study and Agriculture." She said
in part: "Nature study does not
teach sciences to the children as
sciences, but takes for its text some
thing which the child has observed,
and simply tells the child some
thing more than he has observed.
Children are much more observant
than grown people, and the pri
mary object of nature study is to
keep the child's eyes open.
"The relation of nature study to
agriculture is very important, and
the education of the agricultural
classes must be by teaching the
children and others, interesting
them in the country, and keeping
their minds on the farms. Once
this interest is aroused there need
be no fear of the great movement
to cities. The farmer needs a
higher education than the business
man, therefore we hope that we can
show the country child that he can
use his brains on the farm and get
fair returns."
Dr. E. A. Ross delivered the first
lecture of the afternoon. He said
that the farmer of twenty years ago
produced nearly all he consumed.
The farmer was in those days more
or less a self-sufficing economical
unit. Today, however, the farmer
conducts his farm as a commercial
enterprise. He is now as much on
a cash basis as is the merchant.
He no longer has a "surplus," as
he sells all his produce and as a
rule buys all he consumes.
The prime factor of this is cheap
transportation; the second factor
is cheap machinery; and the third
reason is the rise of cities. Be

cause of these three reasons it is
cheaper to bring the raw products
to the city and have the work done
there and bring it back to the
farm. He then showed that the
fanner was essentially a business
man who must know all the
branches of his business. This
same business, according to Dr.
Ross, is a complicated and
complex affair, involving
both a thorough knowledge
of modern commercial transac
tions and careful research in latter
day agricultural scientific develop
ment.
Dr. O. P. Jenkins spoke on "Bees
and Fruit Growing." He showed
that the bee, particularly the honey
bee, was of inestimable service to
the fruit trees in acting as carriers
of pollen from flower to flower, and
in this manner fertilizing the plant.
He advised all fruit-growers with
large orchards to keep a number of
bees for the purpose of cross-fertil
ization. While cross-fertilization is
not absolutely necessary, it always
gives the best results. He took up
a flower and illustrated by charts
and drawings the different parts,
pointing out how essential it was
to have the pollen of the male
flower carried to the female flower.
He demonstrated the pollenation of
plants, showing that this was ac
complished through three agencies
birds, wind, and insects. Of in
sects the most important are the
bees.
