The concert in the assembly hall
last night was given by Mr. Henry
Bettman, of the King conservatory
in San Jose, and Mrs. Susie Hert-
Mark and Mrs. Edith Yarndley-
Fallenius, of San Francisco. Mr.
Bettman played here last semester
and needed no further introduction
to a Stanford audience. From an
artistic standpoint very few, if any,
violinists who have appeared here
have surpassed him. The most
pleasing tiling about his playing is
its thoroughly artistic and mu
sicianly character. He possesses a
perfect control over his instrument,
but his brilliant techniqueisalvvays
made subservient to musical inter
pretation. Me is perhaps even too

reserved and his playing might
with advantage display a little
more of the fire and force of his
master, Ysaye, whose pupil he was
for several years. This was espec
ially noticeable in the opening
number, Grieg's F major sonate,
in which, owing to the undue prom
inence of the piano, and possibly
the violinist's own nervousness, he
did not do himself justice. This
was all overcome in the Vieuxtemps
number, which was given in a
brilliant and masterful way and
for which, as an encore, Mr. Bett
man played Raff's cavatina.
Mrs. Mark's first number was
Luckstone's waltz-song, "Delight,"
and was enthusiastically received.
Her voice is very pure and flexible,
and under perfect control, and the
solo, which makes rather severe de
mands upon a vocalist, showed her
at her best. For an encore she
sang "Dolly's Revenge." Mrs.
Mark was equally successful in her
other numbers, especially the
"Schwanenlied." Mrs. Fallenius,
though greatly hampered by the
poor piano, was a very efficient ac
companist.
