# Engineering Notes.

### 
—Professor Perrine has furnished
the department with a barrel of in
sulators which are to be tested for
mechanical strength.
—Professor Winship recently
performed some interesting experi
ments upon the class in Electro-
Chemistry showing the workings
of electrolytic cells.
—A new course on Practical
Problems of Flectrical Engineer
ing is being given by Professor Cope
land. The class has recently stud
ied the working < 112 the new plant
in Palo Alto under various loads.
---Professor Wing will take the
Junior engineering students to San
Francisco next Saturday. They
will visit the Union Iron Works,
the creasoting plant at Oakland,
and other engineering works of in
terest.
—It is reported that the campus
is to be lighted by the Blue Lakes
Power Company. Just what use
the power-house will be put to has
not been decided. At some future
date it may be turned over to the
Engineering department for exper
imental purposes.
—The class in Railway Bridges
have been designing an overhead
crossing applicable to the S.P. Co.'s
track across University Avenue in
Palo Alto. The plan is to raise the
track eleven feet and to lower the
grade of the avenue five and a half
feet, making passage for the avenue
fourteen feet clear. This will re
duce the grade of the track between
the bridge over the San Francis
quito Creek to the depot from one
per cent, to three-hundreths per
cent.
—The class in Railway Location
is having some difficulty in reach
ing the top of the divide between
Mayfield and Felt Lake with the
maximum grade they have as
sumed. The present plan is to
make a loop near Dead Horse can
yon and then by swinging around
the hill by the Page Mill road to
secure distance enough to enable
them to make the required eleva
tion. The preliminary line is be
ing rapidly pushed toward complet
ion, and will probably reach Felt
Lake in a week or two.
