# Junior Prom.
## 
### 
The Junior Prom.committee had
a meeting Wednesday and decided
to hold the dance in Encina Hall,
with music by Yank's orchestra of
six pieces. The committee plan to
give a banquet in connection with
the ball instead of ordinary re
freshments. The programs will be
original in design, and among the
dances they propose to introduce
special features to give variety to
the entertainment. Another meet
ing will be held next week when
the order of dances and the price
of tickets will be settled upon.
