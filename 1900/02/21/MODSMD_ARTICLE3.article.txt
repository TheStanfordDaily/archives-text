# Junior Farce Selected.
## 
### 
The Junior Farce Committee
met yesterday afternoon in room
23 quad, and chose the farce to be
given on Junior Day.
But two farces were submitted,
\j. MacF. Bowman and Win. Erb
being the only contestants for the
prize of fifteen dollars offered by
the class for the most acceptable
farce. The committee finally de
cided to accept Wm. Erb's produc
tion as the more meritorious. He
has produced something entirely
unique and original, that has never
been attempted here before. The
committee is confident that it will
score a complete success. Bow
man's farce was an exceedingly
clever one on the regular lines.
While the committee regarded his
farce very favorably, their final de
cision was given in favor of Erb's
play on account of its uniqueness.
It is an ultra dramatic melodrama
in three acts and a grand resurrec
tion scene entitled "All Hut Two."
The plot is very clever and is well
suited to the capabilities of the
dramatic talent of the University.
