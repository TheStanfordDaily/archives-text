# Probably No Field-Day.
## 
### 
Track Manager Cantwell, '01, re
turned this afternoon from a con
ference with Manager Decoto of the
University of California at Berke
ley yesterday evening. The matter
to he arranged was the settlement
of the controversy over the place of
holding the field-day. Since the
resignation of Professor Bacon the
Berkeley management has been try
ing to get a member of their faculty
to serve as their representative on
the Arbitration Committee. Man
ager Decoto now acknowledges the
impossibility of that, owing to the
treatment which Colonel Edwards
received in being removed by the
Herkelev Athletic Committee when
he voted that the field-day be held
on the Stanford campus. l)ecoto
proposed that the matter be left to
John Elliott of the Olympic club,
the third member of the Arbitra

tion Committee, but he, on applica
tion, refused to serve alone. I)e
-coto's next move was to propose a
third entirely disinterested party,
but to this Cantwell would not
agree, as some knowledge of the
conditions is necessary to a fair
settlement.
No other solution being proposed,
Cantwell repeated Stanford's de
mand that the lield-day be held on
our campus in accordance with
last year's agreement. Decoto in
sisted that that arrangement was
simply between managers and re
fused to recognize any such thing
as moral obligation. Not being in
writing, he said, it would have no
force.
With these declarations the
conference ended. When seen this
evening Cantwell said that a meet
ing of tbe Athletic Committee will
be held as soon as possible to
officially declare our position. An
ultimatum embodying the stand
already taken will then without
doubt be declared, as Stanford is
in a position to stand by her de
mands. Unless Berkeley agrees to
carry out last year's program there
will be no intercollegiate field-day
this year.
