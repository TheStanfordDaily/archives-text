# Women's Petition Refused.
## 
### 
A petition signed by the women
of the University, requesting the
faculty committee on student ath
letics to reconsider its recent action
forbidding match basket-ball
games, was presented to the com
mittee at its meeting yesterday.
The petition was refused. The
matter was brought up and dis
cussed at a meeting of last year's
basket-ball team held this after
noon. In view of the fact that no
match games will be allowed this
year the team accepted the resigna
tion of Mis√ü Yrene Pitcher as cap
tain. No new captain was chosen,
it being considered unnecessary.
