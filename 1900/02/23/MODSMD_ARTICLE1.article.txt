# CLOSING LECTURE.
## Practical Talks Given to Fruit Growersâ€”The End of a Successful Week's Work. 
### 
Thursday's lectures to fruit
growers was begun by an address
on "The Marketing and Prepara
tion of Cured Fruits," by S. F.
Leib of San Jose, president of the
Board of Trustees of the Univer
sity. His remarks were practical
and were valuable as coming from
one who has made a scientific
study of the handling of fruits for
market. He spoke particularly
of the methods of preparing prunes
and covered the work in detail
from harvesting to marketing.
The address was followed by a
short discussion in which the hon
esty of packers and its importance
as affecting eastern markets brought
forth some spirited debate.
The next address was by Edward
Berwick of Monterey, on "The
Nicaragua Canal." He treated
the subject in a manner which
showed a thorough knowledge of
the conditions pertaining to the
construction of the water-way, and
thought that it should be built by
the United States, independently
of any other nation. If such could
not be done, it would be better to
have no canal at all.
In the afternoon the program
was opened by Dr. Edward A. Boss
with a lecture, on "The Laws of
Transportation." Dr. Ross has
made a thorough study of this
subject, and his talk was very in
structive. Transportation is be
coming more and more a function
of society, and the labor and capi
tal connected with it is constantly
increasing. His closing remarks
were taken up with a discussion of
the tendencies of traffic to increase
between North and South and to
proportionately decrease between
the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards.
Professor Cotnstock closed the
day's program with a talk on
"Scale Insects," supplemented with
an exhibition of microscopic pre
parations of insects. He discovered
and named the "San Jose scale,"
which has become widely known
and has greatly annoyed the fruit
growers of the Santa Clara valley.
Professor Comstock explained how
the name became applied to the in
sect, and told of his efforts to stop
the action of the newspaper in giv
ing to this pest the name of a dis
trict in which it is no longer found.
Professor Dudley of the Botany
department delivered the first lec
ture this morning, on "The Next
Step in Forestry." He said:
"Forest preservation is really and
solely a business matter. If our
forests are to be made to pay,
there must be a system of caring
for them. If they are to do their
part in the conservation of the
water supply, they must be guarded
and protected." Professor Dudley
then described the processes by
which forests aid in filling the
ground with water, and how the
over-pasturing of the woodland
will, by destroying and killing the
brush, check the water supply.
Confining himself then to the
consideration of California forests,
Professor Dudley said that the
forests around the head-waters of

the Sacramento river should be re
served and protected, making one
continuous reservation in the basin
of California, not for the good of
California alone, but for the whole
Union. Professor Dudley spoke
then of some investigations he has
been making during the past year
of the conditions in the northern
counties of the State. He has been
gathering statistics relative to the
destruction of forests there, and has
found that fully 850,000 acres of
redwood lands were burned over
during 18 ( J9, as against 2,000 acres
in the government belt. From his
investigations Professor Dudley
has found evidence that there is
hardly an acre of forest-land in the
State that has not at some time or
other been burned over.
Prof. C. \V. Wood worth of the
University of California then gave
a practical talk on the "Principles
of Spraying." He pointed out the
necessity of spraying at the right
season of the year, and told of the
various methods and the best ways
of spraying different trees.
Dr. Fetter spoke this afternoon
on "Co-operation." He dwelt at
length on co-operative stores and
their difficulties, and then of co-op
eration among producers. Speak
ing of co-operative fruit marketing,
he pointed out that the success of
this undertaking was a realization
of the difficulties that are sure to
be met with, and a surety that the
gains are not overestimated. Dr.
Fetter closed his lecture by making
a plea for the introduction of the
element of missionary motive
which is a feature of co-operation
in England and Germany.
The last lecture of the session
was given this afternoon by Profes
sor O. P. Jenkins of the Physiol
ogy department, on "Bees and Pee
Culture." Professor Jenkins ap
proached the question from the
standpoint of the fruit-grower. He
discussed the value of bees in fer
tilizing flowers and emphasized the
value of the cross-fertilization ef
fected by the bees. After the lec
ture he illustrated some of the
points he had made in connection
with his lecture with samples of
bee-keepers' supplies.
After Professor Dudley's lecture
this morning, over sixty of the
members present signed a resolu
tion which is to be presented to our
representative in Congress, favor
ing the bill now before Congress
empowering the President to ac
quire and add to our forest reserve
the Calaveras Grove of Big Trees.

The next address was by Edward
Berwick of Monterey, on "The
Nicaragua Canal." He treated
the subject in a manner which
showed a thorough knowledge of
the conditions pertaining to the
construction of the water-way, and
thought that it should be built by
the United States, independently
of any other nation. If such could
not be done, it would be better to
have no canal at all.
In the afternoon the program
was opened by Dr. Edward A. Boss
with a lecture, on "The Laws of
Transportation." Dr. Ross has
made a thorough study of this
subject, and his talk was very in
structive. Transportation is be
coming more and more a function
of society, and the labor and capi
tal connected with it is constantly
increasing. His closing remarks
were taken up with a discussion of
the tendencies of traffic to increase
between North and South and to
proportionately decrease between
the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards.
Professor Cotnstock closed the
day's program with a talk on
"Scale Insects," supplemented with
an exhibition of microscopic pre
parations of insects. He discovered
and named the "San Jose scale,"
which has become widely known
and has greatly annoyed the fruit
growers of the Santa Clara valley.
Professor Comstock explained how
the name became applied to the in
sect, and told of his efforts to stop
the action of the newspaper in giv
ing to this pest the name of a dis
trict in which it is no longer found.
Professor Dudley of the Botany
department delivered the first lec
ture this morning, on "The Next
Step in Forestry." He said:
"Forest preservation is really and
solely a business matter. If our
forests are to be made to pay,
there must be a system of caring
for them. If they are to do their
part in the conservation of the
water supply, they must be guarded
and protected." Professor Dudley
then described the processes by
which forests aid in filling the
ground with water, and how the
over-pasturing of the woodland
will, by destroying and killing the
brush, check the water supply.
Confining himself then to the
consideration of California forests,
Professor Dudley said that the
forests around the head-waters of

the Sacramento river should be re
served and protected, making one
continuous reservation in the basin
of California, not for the good of
California alone, but for the whole
Union. Professor Dudley spoke
then of some investigations he has
been making during the past year
of the conditions in the northern
counties of the State. He has been
gathering statistics relative to the
destruction of forests there, and has
found that fully 850,000 acres of
redwood lands were burned over
during 18 ( J9, as against 2,000 acres
in the government belt. From his
investigations Professor Dudley
has found evidence that there is
hardly an acre of forest-land in the
State that has not at some time or
other been burned over.
Prof. C. \V. Wood worth of the
University of California then gave
a practical talk on the "Principles
of Spraying." He pointed out the
necessity of spraying at the right
season of the year, and told of the
various methods and the best ways
of spraying different trees.
Dr. Fetter spoke this afternoon
on "Co-operation." He dwelt at
length on co-operative stores and
their difficulties, and then of co-op
eration among producers. Speak
ing of co-operative fruit marketing,
he pointed out that the success of
this undertaking was a realization
of the difficulties that are sure to
be met with, and a surety that the
gains are not overestimated. Dr.
Fetter closed his lecture by making
a plea for the introduction of the
element of missionary motive
which is a feature of co-operation
in England and Germany.
The last lecture of the session
was given this afternoon by Profes
sor O. P. Jenkins of the Physiol
ogy department, on "Bees and Pee
Culture." Professor Jenkins ap
proached the question from the
standpoint of the fruit-grower. He
discussed the value of bees in fer
tilizing flowers and emphasized the
value of the cross-fertilization ef
fected by the bees. After the lec
ture he illustrated some of the
points he had made in connection
with his lecture with samples of
bee-keepers' supplies.
After Professor Dudley's lecture
this morning, over sixty of the
members present signed a resolu
tion which is to be presented to our
representative in Congress, favor
ing the bill now before Congress
empowering the President to ac
quire and add to our forest reserve
the Calaveras Grove of Big Trees.
