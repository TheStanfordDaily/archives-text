# BASEBALL TOMORROW.
## Berkeley Plays Santa Clara Here. Crowds Witness a Fine Game Yesterday. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Berke
ley varsity will meet the Santa
Clara College team on Stanford
grounds. Both teams have had
hard practice since the last sched
uled games, and should be in the
best of form. Van Haltren, Berke
ley's coach, is an old California
league man and was at one time a
member of the New York Giants.
He has been taking the California
men out for hard practice and is
more than qualified to give the
team pointers in all departments of
the game. The Santa Clara team
has always been first class, and
last year defeated both California
and Stanford in the series. Kelly,
the old Santa Clara pitcher, is still
with the team pitching good ball.
The game will be called at 2:30.
Admission will be 25 cents.
Following is the line-up:
California —Kaarsburg, p.; Smith,
c.; Hamlin, Ist b.; Swan, 2d b.;
Braley, 3d b.; Hunter, ss.; Wolf,
1 112.; McKeown, c 112.; Carter, r 112.
Santa Clara —Kelley,p.; Graham,
c.; Turner, Ist b.; Farry,2db.; Con
ner, 3d b.; Leake, ss.; Finnegan,
1 112.; Magee, c. 112.; Casey, r. 112.
The Varsity was defeated by the
Firemen yesterday by a score of
5-2. The game was a tie, two all,
for ten innings, but the Firemen
succeeded in piling up three runs
in the eleventh, thus winning a
third time from the Varsity. The
game was the best the teams have
put up this season, though both
nines had an epidemic of errors.
The Stanford team held its own
through the tenth inning and it
looked in the ninth as though the
game would go to the Cardinal.
Costly errors, however, threw the
score the other way. Krug, for the
Firemen, struck out fourteen men;
Lanagan, for the Varsity, struck
out nine.
The number of spectators was
unusually large. Besides the stu
dents, about two hundred city peo
ple came down on the excursion
train with the Fireman's Fund team
The score was as follows:
fireman's fund.

The Varsity was defeated by the
Firemen yesterday by a score of
5-2. The game was a tie, two all,
for ten innings, but the Firemen
succeeded in piling up three runs
in the eleventh, thus winning a
third time from the Varsity. The
game was the best the teams have
put up this season, though both
nines had an epidemic of errors.
The Stanford team held its own
through the tenth inning and it
looked in the ninth as though the
game would go to the Cardinal.
Costly errors, however, threw the
score the other way. Krug, for the
Firemen, struck out fourteen men;
Lanagan, for the Varsity, struck
out nine.
The number of spectators was
unusually large. Besides the stu
dents, about two hundred city peo
ple came down on the excursion
train with the Fireman's Fund team
The score was as follows:
