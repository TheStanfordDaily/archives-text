# Field-Day at Stanford.
## 
### 
Track Manager Cantwell received
a brief telegram this afternoon from
Manager Decoto of Berkeley that
they had agreed to hold the inter
collegiate field-day on our campus.
It is not known what caused their
agreement. Cantwell left on an
evening train for San Francisco to
make more definite arrangements.
The form of a ratification by the
Intercollegiate and Athletic Com
mittees will have to be gone through
to complete the agreement.
