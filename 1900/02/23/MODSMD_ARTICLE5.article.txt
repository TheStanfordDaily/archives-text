# Sophomore Dance.
## 
### 
The annual dance of the Soph
omore Class last evening proved to
be one of the most successful affairs
of its kind ever given at the Uni
versity. Instead of following the
precedent set by other sophomore
classes of holding the dance in the
gymnasium, the committee on ar
rangements were fortunate in secur
ing the club room at Encina.
The hall was tastefully decorated
with potted plants, ferns, and ever
greens. The musicians were sta
tioned at the left of the entrance in
an alcove formed by gigantic palms.
On the opposite side of the hall, a
cozy corner, made bright with
smaller plants and greens, was ar
ranged for the chaperons. A soft,
red light from the decorated chan
deliers gave a pretty effect to the
whole room.
Shortly after nine o'clock the or
chestra under the direction of Yank
opened the program with a two
step. The music was good and
every number was heartily encored.
Refreshments were served in the
lobby, which was prettily arranged
for the occasion.
The dance was thoroughly en
joyed by all present. The credit
for the success of the affair is due
to the committee of arrangements,
who have the distinction of manag
ing a cotillion which was a success
not only socially but also finan
cially.
