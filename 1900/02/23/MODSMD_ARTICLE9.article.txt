The intercollegiate field-day
is going to be held on our campus.
There has been much unnecessary
controversy and delay in reaching
this conclusion. Now that it has
been reached, however, active
preparations in anticipation of the
accommodations which will be
necessary must be started at once.
With this event will probably
come the intercollegiate debate,
and one of the exchange concerts.
Our accommodations for these
events are without doubt far ahead
of anything which Berkeley can
provide. On the track is where
our efforts will have to be expended.
It is certainly naturally superior
to the oval on which the field-day
was held last year, but needs con
siderable work to be put into con
dition. If the student body will
stand behind the managements
from now on, when the real work is
required, as they have supported
them in the demand for holding
the events here, the success of cam
pus contests in these particulars
will be assured. We believe they
will, and that the intercollegiate
field-day of 1900 will be acknow
ledged a full success.
