# SATURDAY'S GAMES.
## Each University Baseball Team Plays a Practice Match on Its Opponent's Diamond. 
### 
The exchange game on our cam
pus Saturday between Berkeley
and Santa Clara College was won
by the former, with a score of 7 to
4. The game does not afford much
ground for a comparison between
the Varsity and California's nine,
for the playing of both teams was
below college standard. Kaars
burg struck out ten men, while
Kelley, who is usually invincible,
was able to fan only one of Berke
ley's batters, and Leake, also of
Santa Clara, was far from being up
to his old-time form.
The fourth game of the Stanford-
Fireman's Fund series was played
on the Berkeley campus Saturday,
the Firemen winning by a score of
7 to 3. Our team had undergone a
general shake-up, caused by the
absence of Lanagan and Strohn,
and consequently put up a listless
game as compared to the exhibi
tion the same nines offered in
Thursday's match.
Hampson was in the box for
Stanford until the last inning, and
although he showed nervousness in
hitting batters and allowing two
men to walk to first, his record was
nearly equal to that of Moskimon
who struck out one man to Hamp
eon's two. Moore replaced Hamp
son in the last inning, but was
rather ineffective.
The work of the field was an im
provement over that of previous
games. Notwithstanding the heavy
hitting of the city team, not an er
ror is recorded against our fielders.
Brown was tried for the first time
in right, and accepted his only two
chances in creditable style. Havens,
also, though playing out of position
at first base, played an errorless
game.
As usual, the great fault of Stan
ford was in batting. There were
only six base hits made, and those
shared very unequally among the
men.
The score was as follows:
