Fortunately there is this year
a very cordial feeling between the
two intercollegiate debating com
mittees, despite the impression one
would gain from an editorial which
appeared last week in the Daily
Californian. In it there was an at
tempt made to show that the Stan
ford committee has a long list of
innovations to propose, and that
these innovations are based more
on jealousy than on reason. The
fact is that there has not been for
several years a more pleasant re
lationship between the two com
mittees, and each committee frankly
acknowledges that such changes as
are under consideration are as fair
for one university as for the other.

Both committees, also, are ready to
make any alterations in the old
system that are clearly in the line
of improvements, and wherever
there has been discussion the sole
point under consideration has been
as to whether the proposals would
or would not make for the better.
If the Californian has any further
occasion to comment, we suggest
that it first confer with the Berkeley
committee, who will, we have found
out by investigation, state the case
as we have stated it.
