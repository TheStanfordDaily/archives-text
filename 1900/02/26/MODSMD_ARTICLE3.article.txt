# Intercollegiate Debating Committee.

### 
The Stanford-California Inter
collegiate Debating Committee held
a second meeting in San Francisco
on last Saturday with all members
present. The old debating agree
ment was discussed and several
changes proposed. These relate to
the place of holding the debate, the
number of judges, the instructions
to the judges, the seating of the
judges, and other more minor
points. No definite conclusions
were reached, and another meeting
will be held on next Saturday at
which time all debating matters
will probably be settled. It was
agreed that Berkeley should this
year submit the first list of names
of possible judges and that this list
shall be in the hands of the Stan
ford committee by March sth.
Stanford will submit a counter
list one week later.
