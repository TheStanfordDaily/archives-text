## Regular Sunday Sermon Delivered by Rev. Alexander Eaken Yesterday. 
### 
Rev. Alexander Eaken of Santa
Cruz preached in the chapel Sun
day morning, taking as his subject,
"The Impregnable Rock, Jesus
Christ." He said in part: ''There
can be nothing more desirable,
more urgent to any man than a
solid, rest-giving faith. Without it
life is aimless, passionless, and
death a thing of terror. With it
life is beautiful, and death calm
rest in God.
"No critic is more searching than
time. The ideals of this genera
tion are not those of the last. But
through all the changes of nineteen
centuries Christ's character stands
the same. Now this character was
real; it is conceivable that this
Christ was the invention of some
skillful man. But this is incredi
ble, for Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John had not the ability to create
such a character. They were sim
ply rude, uncultured men. As well
expect common laborers to arise
and produce a work of art equal to
that of Rubens or Raphael. The
surroundings of Matthew, Mark,
Luke, arid John make it impossible
to portray this perfect, glorious
character. How could the thistles
of Jewish surroundings produce
these figs of perfection? 'It would,'
as Channing says, 'take a Jesus to
forge a Jesus.'
"Christ's character is super
human. You cannot account for
His ability. Men say even today:
'Never man spake as this man
spake.' Compare the 'Sermon on
the Mount' with the utterances of
the greatest of modern orators. Is
it conceivable that he who uttered
these words was only a Jewish arti
san, a common carpenter and
nothing more? It seems to me as
clear as daylight that Christ must
have come from above and was di
rected by heaven. 'Whence hath
this man his mighty works?'
Whence indeed! As well say that
the rose of Sharon could grow and
bloom amid the Arctic ice as that
Christ could have been mortal.
"The records of his life are them
selves inspired. First, the sayings
recorded are the most wonderful
ever uttered. Now recollect that
Jesus himself never wrote a line,
and that these words must have
been written from memory. Sec
ondly, remember that the disci pies
were men not entirely in sympathy
with Him from the first and hardly
understood what they recorded so
carefully. How could these men,
blind and slow of heart, record
these sayings unaided by divine
power? How could they recall
and record sayings so profound
without help from above? Sup
pose you yourself were asked to re
cord Christ's life from his birth to
his death. Could you do it? Yet,
how much better advantages we
have than these disciples! I am
persuaded that the only solution of
this matter is in the words of
Christ: 'The Holy Ghost shall
teach you all things and bring all
things to your remembrance.'"
