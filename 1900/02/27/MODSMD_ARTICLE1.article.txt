# TRAINING HOUSE POLICY
## Final Report of the Training House Committee Recommends a Definite Plan of Action. 
### 
Following is an abridgment of
the report of the Training House
Committee covering the field of its
investigations, submitted for the
consideration of the Executive Com
mittee and the Associated Students:
Report of Committee on Training
House.
To the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students :
This committee, appointed in ac
cordance with the resolution of the
Executive Committee of the Asso
ciated Students on October 9, 1899,
authorizing the investigation of the
feasibility of the project and means
of raising funds for such a purpose,
respectfully submits the following
report:
RELATION OF TIIE TRAINING HOUSE TO
THE PERMANENT ATHLETIC FIELD.
At the very outset, one of the first
questions which came up for con
sideration was that of the location
of the training house with reference
to the athletic fields of the Univer
sity. The question is vital. No
improvement such as the training
house should be located at a dis
tance from any athletic field, nor in
close proximity to a field not per
manent nor definitely allotted to
the use of the students by the Uni
versity authorities. Accordingly
the committee has begun a move
ment to bring this matter to the
notice of the University authorities
and in co-operation with them to
have land definitely allotted as the
permanent site for the athletic field.
This should be the best location
possible after taking into consider
ation all the available sites and
their advantages with a special
reference to (1) accessibility, (2)
drainage, (3) wind-breaks, etc. As
soon as this is done, the site of the
training house can be easily settled,
and a consistent plan for the im
provement of the athletic field and
the erection of a training house de
veloped. Considerable has been
accomplished along these lines:
(1) In having the different avail
able sites surveyed; (2) in placing
the matter clearly before the Uni
versity authorities. As soon as
final consent is obtained to alloting
a definite site for the athletic field,
this committee is prepared to give
its final report upon this point,
which while fundamental is one of
the simplest of solution and which
need not delay the other important
questions which demand immediate
action —those of finances.
ESTIMATES AS TO COST.
Estimates as to cost vary from
$3,000 to $25,000, according to the
different accommodations and fea
tures desired to be incorporated in
such a building, from simple train
ing quarters with baths, showers,
steam room, dressing and rubbing
rooms, to a more elaborate struc
ture, having in addition to these
features sleeping rooms for mem
bers of teams, dressing rooms with
lockers, kitchen, dining room, main
hall with fireplace, storeroom, and

offices for managers and student
body officers. The amount of money
to be expended will be determined
by the amount which can be raised,
but no structure should be built
which would not be a credit to the
Stanford campus and not suited for
the use of Stanford teams for years
to come. But the thing of most
importance is to get a training
house built which shall be neat,
substantial, and serviceable. Such
a building, with the features enu
merated, should cost in the neigh
borhood of $11,000. Dr. Angell's
estimate for a modest structure for
training purposes is only $3,000.
If work could be begun June Ist,
the building should be in readiness
for the next football season, and
the fall trip to a mountain resort
avoided.
According to the estimate of a
Stanford engineer competent to
judge, the cost of new track, turf
football field, with practice fields,
new baseball field, drainage and
grading, would be $2,500. For
permanent grandstands accommo
dating 10,000 people with the best
possible features, etc., $6,000 to
$10,000. Other improvements,
$1,500. Total, $25,000.
QUESTIONS OF SUBSEQUENT ECONOMY.
In considering the whole subject
of training house and permanent
athletic field the committee has
been struck with the number of
economies which would result when
these were secured for the use of
the Stanford athletic teams. The
question of campus games and the
athletic policy outlined in the new
athletic agreement forces the con
sideration of the economies that
will result therefrom.
Cost of erecting grandstand in
San Francisco $3,400
Rent of grounds 1,150
Rent of trunk-room 30
Rent of rubbing-room 54
Expense last week of train
ing 667
Transportation to Del Monte 140
Hotel bills and incidentals 300
Better facilities for collection
of admissions 300
$6,041
It is difficult to form an exact es
timate of the increased cost of main
taining a training house and per
manent athletic field, but it is safe
to say that the cost of the training
table would not exceed $983, which
the management expended this
year, and the question of a perma
nent keeper could be solved by the
permanent employment of one of
the training force, who should also
have charge of the house. The
cost of maintaining a well-built
and well-drained field would be no
greater than under the present sys
tem of learing up annually the
baseball field for football and later
putting it in shape for baeeball.
QUESTIONS OF FINANCE.
l/pon this point the committee
is prepared to make definite rec
ommendations. The following are
possible means of securing the
funds necessary for the erection of
the training house and the improve
ment of an athletic field site:
1. Gifts and contributions.

2. Assessments and appropria
tions from the Associated Students.
I. GIFTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS.
These are purely voluntary and
not within calculation from a bus
iness standpoint, depending upon
the interest taken in the project by
friends of the University, or
aroused through the efforts of indi
vidual students. There are in the
possession of the committee prom
ises to contribute amounting to
$300 when the proposition assumes
definite shape. There is available
in cash $230 left by the Class of
'99 as a beginning of the fund and
for drawing up preliminary and
architectural plans.
11. ASSESSMENTS, APPROPRIATIONS, AND
LOANS.
We recommend at the outset the
placing of the training house fund
upon a sound and secure basis
which will appeal to representative
business men and reputable banks
alike so that money to the amount
needed may be borrowed at a nom
inal rate of interest. In order to
accomplish this we recommend
that the Associated Students estab
lish a sinking fund to guarantee
the payment of the principal and
interest when due, made up in the
following manner; (1) By adding
yearly all student body assessments
to the sinking fund; (2) By adding
yearly five per cent, of the gross
income of the Associated Students
to the sinking fund; (3) By adding
one-half of the surplus remaining
in the treasury of the Associated
Students after all the debts of each
current year are paid.
In pursuance with this plan we
recommend that the Executive
Committee submit to the Associated
Students the following amendment
to their constitution and by-laws:
The constitution and by-laws of
the Associated Students shall be so
amended that article IV of the by
laws shall read:
IV. 1. Revenues.—The revenues
of the association shall be derived
from: First, dues, which shall be
$1 per year. Second, special assess
ments, which may be levied by a
majority vote at any meeting.
Third, receipts from all games, en
tertainments, and benefits held un
der the auspices of the association,
including donations and all other
sources of revenue.
2. Sinking Fund.—There shall be
paid into a sinking fund, estab
lished for the purpose of securing a
permanent athletic field and train
ing quarters, the following revenue:
First, the dues aB provided for in
section 1 of this article, all of which
are to be paid over by the end of
the semester in which collected.
Second, five per cent of the gross
receipts of the association, exclusive
of student body dues and special
assessments to be paid monthly.
Third, fifty per cent of the net sur
plus remaining in the treasury of
the association at the end of each
college year. It shall be the duty
of the treasurer of this association
to pay this fund to the treasurer of
the Training House Corporation, to
be administered and expended in
accordance with the constitution
and by-laws of the Training House
Corporation, which constitution and

I by-laws shall be ratified by the
Executive Committee in accordance
with article 111 of the by-laws of
the Associated Students.
A TRAINING HOUSE CORPORATION.
Under this head we make the
following recommendation: First,
that the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students designate
seven men of the University com
munity of recognized ability and
energy and authorize them to in
corporate as a permanent training
house corporation, which shall ad
minister and expend the Training
house Fund according to a consti
tution and by-laws which shall be
submitted to the Executive Com
mittee for ratification according to
Article 111 of the By-Laws of the
Associated Students. Second, that
this corporation shall submit com
plete reports each semester to the
Associated Students covering all
financial and administrative trans
actions, shall not contract loans
nor liabilities above a limit to be
specified by the Associated Stu
dents, and shall submit for final
ratification and approval all plans
of sites and buildings. It is the
unanimous opinion of this com
mittee that such a corporation
should be formed in order to en
sure permanence in management
and to place the handling of the
fund on a sound business footing.
Such a corporation would inspire
the confidence of business men,
contractors, alumni, and others, in
the permanency of the enterprise,
would give the commission a se
cure legal standing with clearly
defined powers, while its formation
under the auspices of the Execu
tive Committee and the Associated
Students would guarantee to the
student body a careful and con
sistent management of the fund
placed under the control of the
corporation.
This report covers in the main
the results of several months of
earnest investigation, and we be
lieve that the plan here presented
is the simplest and most feasible
manner of attaining the end de
sired.
Respectfully submitted,
0. C. Leiter,
Milnor Roberts,
J. E. McDowell,
Ralph Arnold,
J. Hurt Gildersleeve,
Henry H. Taylor,
T. J. Hoover, Chairman.
At yesterday's meeting of the
Executive Committee, to whom the
report was submitted, the amend
ment in regard to establishing a
sinking fund as recommended in
the report was acted upon favora
bly, and a resolution was passed,
submitting the same to the vote of
the Associated Students. The
question of a permanent training
house corporation was discussed
and the present training - house
committee was authorized to have
drawn up by a competent attorney
a constitution and by-laws of the
proposed corporation for considera
tion at the next meeting of the
Executive Committee. This con
stitution and by-laws will be pub
lished in a succeeding issue of the
Daily Palo Alto.
