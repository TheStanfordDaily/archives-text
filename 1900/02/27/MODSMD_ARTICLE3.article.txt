The Training House Committee
today makes public some of the re
sults of their several months of in
vestigation. The report does not
by any means give a complete idea
of all the work that lias been done,
but nevertheless presents a tangible
plan for student body approval.
That is exactly what is needed to
carry the proposition forward.
There has already been considerable
time lost since the matter of a
training house was first broached.
If we are to have that institution it
should certainly be ready for the
next football season. Since definite
plans have now been outlined,
there need be no further delay in
the matter. As the report points
out, obstacles in the way of any one
particular need not hinder the de
velopment of the rest of the plan.
The committee's recommendation
that much expense may be saved
next fall by a completion of the
building before that time, is one
which should have considerable
weight in procuring an energetic
prosecution of the work.
