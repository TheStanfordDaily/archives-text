One of the professors who
judged the intercollegiate semi
finals objected to the short time
allowed the judges in order to
make their decision. He com
plained, first, of there being no
time between the speakers. One
man would speak, and before the
judges had time to crystallize their
opinion of that speaker, they would
have to turn their attention to the
next one in order to be able to
judge him. If some time wen
allowed between each speaker, the
judges would be able to form their
opinion more critically, and would
then be able to turn their undi
vided attention to the next man.
VVhen, as happened in the semi
finals this semester, twenty-seven
men follow one another without
interruption, tho judges are apt to
have a rather hazy recollection of

the first speakers. Then the time
for selecting the winners, he says,
is too short. No harm could be
done by allowing the judges a day
or even more to consider the
speeches more critically and to
allow their opinions to crystallize
into something definite. This
would obviate the difficulty of
having to select from such a large
number almost on the spur of the
moment. There would be no hur
rying to decide before the lights
went out, and the contestants
would at least have the consolation
that the choice of the judges was
made after mature consideration.
We do not offer this as our own
view especially, but as the sugges
tion of one in a position to under
stand the defect of the present
system of hasty action. There is
in it food for reflection on the part
of the debating league in anticipa
tion of the coming intercollegiate
finals.
