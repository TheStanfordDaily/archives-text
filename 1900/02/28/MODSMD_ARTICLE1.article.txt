# TUESDAY EVENING LECTURE.
## Dr. Branner Speaks in the Chapel on Our Trade Relations with Brazil. 
### 
The regular Tuesday evening lec
ture was delivered by Dr. Branner,
head of the Geology department,
on the subject, "American Trade
with Brazil." He began with some
remarks concerning the description
of the country, character of the
people, and kinds of industries car
ried on in Brazil. In regard to the
industries Dr. Branner said: "The
principal business industries are
the production and shipment of
coffee, rubber, cocoa, hides, red
cedar, and some sugar. These are
all industries requiring little or no
machinery and here lies the great
characteristic of the Brazilian peo
ple; they use little or no machinery
and have no manufactures. They
have beds of iron ore as rich as any
in the world, yet all their iron im
plements and what little machin
ery they use are imported. They
take pride in one or two national
manufacturing industries, but they
are of the same character as the
match industry. You cannot get
any matches in Brazil except those
made there, yet if you examine
this business you will find that the
boxes are ready stamped, the sticks
cut ready for use, and all other ma
terials necessary for this business
are imported. All the Brazilians
do is the purely mechanical work
of combining the materials. In
deed, some of the food articles, such
as dried beef and fish, of which
there is an abundance in their own
country, are imported from abroad.
"The people are very conserva
tive. I realized this especially
when visiting the diamond mines.
John Mall visited these mines
about 100 years ago and wrote a
book on the method of mining the
diamonds. I read this book before
going there and for all the changes
I saw in their methods 1 might
have been John Mall himself. The
wagons in general use are exactly
the same as those used by the
Romans in the time of Julius
Caesar. If you remonstrate with
the people and show them better
tools they say: 'Those things are
very beautiful, but they are not for
us.'
"I remember a man who went
from New York to Rio Janeiro a
few years ago. He noticed that
every parcel, be it as big as this
pulpit or the size of my fist, was
carried on the head of a negro. The
American rubbed his hands to
gether, saying,'l'll have the express
company of the world right here.'
That man went there with his ex
press wagons and waited for busi
ness several years but the people
didn't want their bundles carried
that way and he returned to New
York completely discouraged.
"Now, as to the trade of the
United States with Brazil. Weex
port very little; some Hour, kero
sene, oleomargerine, and a few im
plements. We get the bulk of
their coffee and most of their Para
rubber. When we pay for these
things we give them drafts on Lon
don and they trade in England for
the amount of these drafts."
In regard to our diplomatic re

lations with Brazil Dr. Branner
said: "Our diplomatic relations
are all right on the surface, but
beneath there is much distrust. 1
have always been proud of my
country, but some of our diplo
matic agentß in Brazil are men
who would make you blush in the
dark. 1 met one last summer who,
whatever time of the day I met
him, was invariably drunk.
Another was doubtless a good poli
tician and a capable man, but he
persisted in outraging the feelings
of the people by breaches of eti
quette about which the Brazilians
are very strict."
In closing Dr. Branner said:
"Finally, when we are willing to
conduct our trade with the Brazil
ians with some degree of the care
with which the people are treated
by the Europeans, we will gain
what we choose to term our share
of their trade."
