We are informed by the library
authorities that some forty ground
glass incandescent globes have been
taken from the desk lights since the
new building was opened. These
thefts have become so numerous
and annoying that hereafter those
taken will not be replaced. It is
needless to say that such proceed
ings receive no countenance what
ever from the students at large.
The thefts, for these are not merely
acts of mischief, are committed
utterly regardless of the fact that
every student has a common inter
est in the property stolen. Though
the matter looks insignificant in
individual cases, it can easily be
carried to an extreme of great in
convenience to all, and must be put
an end to, unless we all wish to
bear the consequences of the acts of
a few.
