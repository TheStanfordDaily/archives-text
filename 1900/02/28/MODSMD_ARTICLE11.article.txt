Just what is wrong or wanting
with our track athletics is a ques
tion that has perplexed the wise
heads in college affairs for several
years. We have everything that is
needed to put out a successful track
team —a good coach, a fine track,
and material with the ability to de
velop into good track men. The
rooters turn out to a field-day in
just as great numbers as to a base
ball or football game. We enjoy
and take interest in a field-day as
well as any other athletic contest,
but we do not work up to it in the
same manner that we do in football
or baseball. This is a fact that
must be realized by everybody if

we want to break into Berkeley's
string of victories. A successful
team is dependent upon the in
dividual, and until the individual
sees it to be his duty to get out and
do what he can, our total of points
won will be smaller than the total
California wins. There is just as
much glory attached to winning a
point in the sprints or the distances
as there is in making the baseball
or football teams. When individual
students here realize this we will
be on a fair road to track successes.
