The Department of Geology has
been presented with a large relief
map of the region about Chatta
nooga, Tenn., by Professor Albert
H. Purdue of the University of
Arkansas. The map is a valuable
acquisition to the department, as
the district mapped is of particular
interest to geologists as showing the
relation of geology to topography
in a region of folded and faulted
rocks. Professor Purdue graduated
in geology at Stanford in 1893, and
is now head of the department of
geology at the University of Arkan
sas, and is a member of the Amer
ican Institute of Mining Engineers.
