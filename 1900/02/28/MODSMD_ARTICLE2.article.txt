# Baseball Tomorrow.
## 
### 
Santa Clara and the Varsity are
scheduled for a game on the cam
pus tomorrow at 2:30. The game
is sure to be a fast exhibition of
baseball as Santa Clara is anxious
to wipe out the defeat they received
from the Varsity on their own
grounds. In justice to the college
team they should not be judged by
their game with Berkeley on our
campus last week. The entire team
had an off day. Kelley, who is us
ually an enigma to his opponents,
pitched like an novice. He will
undoubtedly try to retrieve himself
and give our team a chance to see
what they can do. The Varsity at
present is somewhat disorganized,
due to Captain Strohn's inability
to take his place behind the bat on
account of his injured hand. He
will go in the game at shortstop.
Longheed will move in from short
stop and do the backstop work.
Havens is to hold down first base.
Murphy, Lowenthal, and Brown
will do the outfield work. Ed
wards and Cowden will play their
usual positions. Lanagan will
pitch. Santa Clara will have the
same line-up as in the Berkeley
game.
