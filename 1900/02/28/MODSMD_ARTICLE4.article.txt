# FRUIT-GROWERS SATISFIED.
## Participants in Last Week's Convention Well Pleased With the Results. 
### 
Some of the prominent fruit
growers who attended the lectures
last week were approached by
representatives of the Daily Palo
Alto and asked to give for publica
tion their views on the results
which such gatherings as those held
here last week attained. Without
exception the fruit men expressed
themselves as well satisfied with
the results of the week. The views
of some of the prominent ranchers
follow:
E. T. Pettit of West Side was en
thusiastic over the meetings. He
spoke of the good that farmers must
receive from leaving their ploughs
to attend such a convention, and
mentioned especially the lecture of
Mrs. Comstock on "The Relation of
Nature Study to Agriculture."
"All the growers I have met," he
said, "have expressed their sur
prise that a woman could handle
such a subject in such a masterly
way as did Mrs. Comstock."
C. H. Rodgers, a prominent or
chardist of Watsonville said: "The
few days I have spent here have
been most profitable. In what way?
Well, I came here to listen to men
of experience. The men here gave
us practical common sense talks.
Our life is eminently practical and
lectures from practical men, men
who have done things, is what we
want. I think this is a grand in
stitution. I like your professors.
They are all earnest young men. I
have been impressed with their
ability, but more than all with
their earnestness. A man now
adays has to specialize. He has to
become almost a 'crank' on some
one subject to succeed, and it's that
earnestness which I find and ad
mire in your faculty.
"Of course, what we have heard
this week will not go directly into
the country. But anyone who has
been here will tell what he has
heard to those about him, and in
that way the information will be
disseminated throughout the State."
J. S. Butler of Palo Alto said:
"These lectures have been among
the rarest treats I have ever exper
ienced. Every one feels very
grateful for the pleasant week
which the untiring efforts of Pro
fessors Kellogg and Comstock have
made possible. A great many new
things have been developed to us
and a great many old ones have
been made more practical."
S. P. Sanders, who has a large
fruit ranch near West Side, said:
"The week has been a most enjoya
ble one to us all. It has been a
pleasant outing to us, and has
offered us a chance to come to
gether and discuss for a week the
topics that interest us most. It
has proved very profitable to me."
Professor C. W. Woodworth of
the University of California, who
aided our professors in the work,
said: "Such gatherings as the one
held here this week are, I take it,
for the purpose of giving to the
farmers of the State something to
take them out of their every-day
lives, to give them something to
think about. They live very prac

tical lives. Here they came in
touch witli and listened to men
with theories, men who set them to
thinking. The work corresponds
in a measure to that performed by
the institute, though the analogy
is, of course, by no means perfect."
Professor Fowler of Berkeley
said: "The growing movement to
hold conventions such as this is
one of considerable importance, not
only to the ranches but to the
State at large as well. It should
be appreciated by these men, as it
is primarily for their benefit. As
conductor of the Farmers' Insti
tute for the University of Califor
nia, I may say that all the work
for the education, instruction, and
pleasure of these men is appreciated
by them. The time is coming,
and in the near future too, when
these conventions will be more and
more appreciated by the farmers
and more and more attended, and
those men who now see their im
portance and aid the movement
will no doubt themselves live to see
a great spread in the movement.
"Science is all the time occupy
ing a larger and larger field in
farming. The universities are the
places whence most of our scien
tific knowledge comes today, and it
is the university professors, there
fore, who can give the orchardists
what they most need. This thought
has struck me often in my tours
through the State."
Professor Fowler speaks out of
ripe experience, having done a
great deal of institute work for the
University of California, in which
capacity he conducted nearly sev
enty institutes last year. He is
also well known as the conductor
of the University of California
Farmers' Institute.
