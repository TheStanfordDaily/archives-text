# COACH CHOSEN.
## Manager Gildersleeve Closes Negotiations Which Determine the Coach for 1900. 
### 
After much care and considera
tion, the question, who should
coach the Cardinal for 1900, has
been decided. The gentleman on
whom depends the outcome of next
Thanksgiving day, as far as Stan
ford is concerned, is F. H. Yost.
Mr. Yost was graduated from
Lafayette College in 1896 and was
a tackle on the champion team
that defeated Pennsylvania that
same collegiate year. Immediately
afterward he was on the all-star
eleven of Pittsburg which was
made up of such men as Heffel
finger, Lea,Trenchard, Brooke, and
Donnelly. In the fall of '97 he
coached and brought into promi
nence the Ohio Wesleyan Univer
sity eleven, which that year held
Michigan down to a 0-0 score.
The next year Yost was called
to coach the team of the Univer
sity of Nebraska. Out of an in
disposed student body, and out of
dissenting factions, he evolved a
team that won- the championship
of the Middle West. That year
Nebraska beat Kansas 18-6, and
Missouri 47-6.
Last year he signed with Kansas
and closed the year with a won
derful record. Of the ten games
that Kansas played, not one was
lost. She beat Nebraska by a score
of 36-20. Benedict, Nebraska's
star drop-kicker, landing four field
goals, Missouri was beaten by
Kansas 84-6.
Yost has played the positions of
tackle and half-back, first on his
college team and later with Pitts
burg.
Yost is a man of excellent repu
tation as a gentleman. His moral
character is unimpeachable. He
has the happy faculty of winning
the respect and admiration of all
whom he meets in his work. The
grand secret of his success seems
to lie in the fact of his ability to
dovelop magnificent team-work.
This is shown by the details of the
work done by teams be has
coached.
Of all the men that have been in
the field for this year's manage
ment to select from, none has pre
sented such evidence of being mas
ter of his profession as Mr. Yost.
On evidence alone has he been
chosen.
