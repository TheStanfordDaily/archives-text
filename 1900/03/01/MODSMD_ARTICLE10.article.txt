The entries for the annual
handicap field-day show .1 much
greater interest in track athletics
than was expected, and those who
have been instrumental in bringing
out so many men —more by a large

number than former handicap field
days have called forth —deserve
much commendation. A record of
one hundred and twenty entries by
sixty-seven men is one that makes us
feel as if there really is some latent
athletic force somewhere in our Uni
versity. It shows that some one
has been doing his duty. And it
follows that there is for those of us
who do not run or jump, an appar
ent obligation to show our appre
ciation by being present at the
meet on Saturday afternoon and
making that presence known. A
lively day all around may be all
there is needed to put track and
field work on a firm basis for this
year.
