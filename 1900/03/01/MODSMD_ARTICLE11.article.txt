The musical clubs, after a short
rest from concert work, are prepar
ing to resume the task of paying
off the deficit incurred this year.
Concerts are being scheduled for
almost every Friday and Saturday
night for the remainder of the
semester, in towns around the bay.
'The men want to avoid the Easter
tour if possible, as there is a chance
of its resulting in an addition in
stead of a subtraction of the de
ficit. Besides, the opportunity
of the Easter vacation for special
work is something the club-men,
especially the upper class-men,
are loath to lose.
On March 9th the clubs are
scheduled to give a concert in Los
Gatos under the auspices of one of
the strongest churches there. This
is the first visit to Los Gatos since
the spring of 1897, when the clubs
scored a great success. The clubs
play on a percentage of receipts
and the town promises a crowded
house. Mayfield is to be favored
this year with a concert date, prob
ably the tenth or seventeenth. An
endeavor is being made to play
San Mateo on the sixteenth. San
Mateo was highly pleased with the
entertainment given there three
years ago, and is expected to pre
pare a good return welcome. Red
wood City, where the concert last
year was indifferently advertised
and poorly attended, will be tried
again and an endeavor made to re
peat the success of '97. Mountain
View may be again visited. Bel
mont is anxious for a concert and
the school, which has creditable
musical organizations of its own,
promises a good attendance.
The concert on the Berkeley cam
pus is scheduled for April 7th, and
the men look forward to this date
with the greatest interest. The
idea of exchange concerts is an in
novation, and should prove a very
happy one. The California clubs
play in our assembly hall on April
20th or 21st, and our musicians
are very anxious to have this an
unqualified success. A large at
tendance will not only assure the
Berkeley musicians the reception
they deserve, but will also help
our own clubs as the latter are to
receive one-half the proceeds.
There will probably be a concert in
San Francisco some Saturday after
noon in April, and possibly an
evening in Oakland.
There remains about five hun
dred dollars yet to lie earned,
and if the clubs are liberally
patronized in these proposed
concerts they should secure the
amount.
