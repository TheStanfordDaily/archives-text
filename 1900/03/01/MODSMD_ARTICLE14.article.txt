# Junior Farce.
## 
### 
Two acts of the Junior farce, "All
But Two, a Mellow-Drama," or
"Seven Daubers Down," have been
completed, and the third act with
the resurrection scene will probably
be finished by next Monday. The
cue books are in the hands of the
cast and rehearsals have already
been begun.
The play is a new departure, be
ing entirely different from anything
presented heretofore, and conse
quently will require a greater
amount of rehearsal than previous
ones. The cast includes about fif
teen characters.
