# POOR BASEBALL FORM.
## Coach Murphy Dissatisfied With the Progress Being Made by the Candidates. 
### 
In an interview this afternoon re
garding the baseball situation,
Coach Murphy strongly expressed
his dissatisfaction with the form at
present shown by the candidates
for the team. He spoke as follows:
"The entire team are playing poor
ball and show no inclination to at
tempt to'improve. They are list
less, careless, and utterly devoid of
the spirit necessary for winning
games. Some of the men are con
ceited enough to imagine that they
have their places cinched, and are
careless about coming out for prac
tice.
"Many of the men stay up late
at night, come to bat the next day,
and wonder why they cannot hit
the ball at a critical moment. The
old men who should be the ones to
set the pace are little better than
the new material, and make no
attempt to influence the work of
the latter. There is too much in
dividuality, and no attempt at
team-work, except in the manner
of misplays.
"The team has not struck a to
boggan, for it has never reached
such a height of perfection that it
could come down. If the present
situation is not rapidly improved,
the support of the student body,
which so far this year has been all
that could be desired, will begin to
lag.
"Today Berkeley's team is fifty
percent better than the Stanford
team, and is improving all the time.
We meet them in less than a
month, and if a respectable showing
is desired, a decided brace must be
taken at once by every man who is
in the field."
Coach Murphy seems to think
that we have the material which
might develop a better team than
present prospects would assume, if
the men would only try. No man
is criticized who honestly tries and
does his best. The above remarks
were directed against the team for
the reason that no apparent efforts
are being put forth by the men.
