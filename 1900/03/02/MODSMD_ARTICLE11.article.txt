With the appointment of a
coach the football season of 1900
can fairly be said to have been
initiated. We now have the trio
completed upon whom the outcome
of the game depends—the coach,
the captain, and the manager.
Each of these has his duties and
within their sphere he must be held
responsible. We believe in a con
centration of responsibility; that, in
the long run, will bring the most
beneficial results. The official who
sounds public opinion may profit
much by what he hears, but in the
end he is the one who must decide
specific matters, and he is the one
who must bear the results of his de
cision. In the matter of the selec
tion of a coach the present man
agement has taken a step some
what at variance with previous
Stanford policy—the engaging of a
man who, while a player of reputa
tion, finds his especial recommen
dation to us in his ability as a
coach. He does not come from one
of the great football universities,
but he has shown his ability in the
coaching line by several years of
successful work. Whether the foot
ball manager has acted wisely in
his choice time alone can tell for
us. But we do not hesitate in our
decision as to the duty of all parties
now that the choice is made.
Opinion unavoidably differs in mat
ters of judgment. That is why
one man is given the responsibility
of choosing, as precedent has
plainly given it to managers in the
matter of coaches. That every one
owes his support to the choice when
once made, there can be no doubt.
Our management this season is
conscientiously working for a Stan
ford victory and it can rest assured
that behind it stands the student
body.
