From the reports current re
garding the articles of incorporation

under which a board of directors to
have charge of the proposed athletic
innovations is to organize, it is not
entirely clear as to one vital point
—the power to incur debt. This
point has been the stumbling block
of a great many corporations and
should receive the most careful at
tention of those who draw up the
articles upon which our organiza
tion shall stand. The law on this
matter is in some respects ambigu
ous, and so much so that members
of California's highest tribunal have
been found unwilling to have any
connection with co-operative bodies,
even where there were explicit limi
tation as to the incurring of debt.
Just what powers the directors are
to have in this regard and just what
are to be their limitations, should
be stated so plainly and directly
that there can be no possibility of
mistake. We do not want to dele
gate to the directors power to either
wittingly or unwittingly contract
obligations beyond the ability of
the student body to pay, and unless
the greatest care is exercised there
is a dangerous liability of just that
state of affairs staring some future
student body in the face, and per
haps a penniless student body at
that. The whole proceeding of in
corporation brings us to the neces
sity of acting in strict accordance
with the law of California. The
surest way of accomplishing this is
the employment of a thoroughly
competent corporation attorney to
draw up the articles of incorpora
tion, regardless of expense. Pennies
spent now may save us dollars a
few years hence. This matter may
have already been considered by
the Executive Committee, but even
if it has, we think it of so great im
portance that it cannot be urged
too emphatically.
