# Yesterday's Score.
## 
### 
Except for the few errors which
cost Stanford the game, yesterday's
baseball was well worth watching.
It was evident that the Varsity's
weakest point is batting. A two
bagger at a critical point in the
eighth inning would have tied and
possibly won the game. The pcore
is as follows:
RUNS BY INNINGS.
