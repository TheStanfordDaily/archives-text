# Field-day Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The Annual Handicap Field-day,
which will be held on the campus
tomorrow at 2 p.m., promises to
be an interesting meeting. The
number of entries is larger than for
several years past and nearly every
event is in doubt. The finishes
will, therefore, be close and excit
ing. Many graduates will be down,
several of them being among the
officials. J. P. Bernhard, '96, ex-
Varsity track captain, who holds
the intercollegiate record for the
220 yard dash, will officiate as
referee. Dr. Richardson and In
structors Storey and Reynolds will
be judges at the finish. Dr. Wood
and Dr. Murphy will be timers.
The field judges will be "Babe"
Burnett, '00, Garth Parker, '00, and
Milnor Roberts, '00, and IT. D.
Lousley, '01, will judge the walk.
O. H. Hahn, '00, will be clerk of
the course; F.D. Hamilton, '01,
scorer; and W. M. Erb, '01, an
nouncer. John Brunton, ex-'99,
who wasVarsity track captain two
years ago, will act as starter.
