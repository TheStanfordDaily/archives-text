# Holiday Next Week.
## 
### 
Founder's Day will be observed
next Friday by a suspension of
University work. It is probable
that the exercises this year will be
held on Thursday evening instead
of Friday, as heretofore, although
no definite arrangements have been
made. Bishop Nichols of San
Mateo will deliver an address, and
a short musical program will be
rendered. A full program will be
published later.
