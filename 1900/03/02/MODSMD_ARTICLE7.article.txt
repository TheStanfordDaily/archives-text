# Boarding- Clubs to Disband.
## 
### 
With the beginning of this se
mester four eating clubs, composed
for the most part of patrons of the
University Inn, were organized in
the Camp. By means of this co
operation the members have been
able to obtain much better fare
than they used to receive at the
Inn, and at a reduced expense.
The number of members has in
creased and in every way the clubs
have been highly satisfactory.
This prosperity, however, was at
the expense of the Inn, and natur
ally the managers of that institu
tion objected. In the lease by
which Winston it Winston ob
tained the Inn, no boarding clubs
were to be permitted to establish
themselves in the future on the
campus. The development of those
at the Camp was in violation of this
agreement and yesterday a bomb
shell was thrown among them by
an order to leave within three days.

Ab the closing of the entire Camp
would be the alternative of disobed
ience of this order, the clubs will
probably disband, some of their
members going to Palo Alto and
some remaining at the Camp, but
most of them going back to the
Inn. The board there has some
what improved over the fare which
drove most of the patrons away
last semester, so there will proba
bly be little dissatisfaction over the
change of affairs.
