# NEW DEBATING AGREEMENT.
## Intercollegiate Committee Makes Some Vital Changesâ€”Place of Contest Still in Doubt. 
### 
After three meetings of the Inter
collegiate Debating Committee of
Stanford University and the Uni
versity of California an agreement
was reached in San Francisco on
last Saturday afternoon which
covers the intercollegiate debate for
three years. This agreement differs
from the old agreement in several
vital points. The changes were
made upon the earnest solicitations
of the Stanford committee and are
thought to mean a marked step in
advance. They refer to the seating
of the judges and to their instruc
tions and the method of rendering
their decision.
Heretofore there has been no de
cided policy as to these three ques
tions. The judges have been seated
together or apart from each other,
according to their acquaintance or
as chance dictated. It seemed to
the Stanford debaters that if seated
apart from each other there would
be a greater likelihood of each
judge reaching his decision inde
pendent of the impression or ideas
of the other judges, and as this is
the practice in eastern universities,
was followed with much satisfaction
at the last Carnot debate, and is
strongly urged by those most inter
ested in debating matters at Stan
ford, it was proposed and carried
through the committee.
The instructions to the judges
was one of the most difficult of the
nuts of the committee to crack.
The old instructions to consider
argument and the presentation of
it were found to be unsatisfactory,
as were also many others that were
proposed. The idea was to get as
simple instructions as possible, so
that the judges should not be con
fused by endeavoring to alter their
own personal standards in order to
meet the more or less artificial
standards of any instructions im
posed by the universities. It was
therefore agreed that the judges
shall simply be told to award the
decision on the merits of the debate
and that the merits of the question
shall not be considered save as they
are presented in the debate. A
clause was also inserted that no
other instructions whatever shall be
given the judges, nor shall these
instructions be interpreted by any
one other than the judges them
selves. This last provision was to
correct an abuse which was appar
ent in the last intercollegiate de
bate.
The way in which the judges
shall reach their decision was con
siderable of a stumbling block.
Stanford wished a majority of
purely individual decisions, while
Berkeley contended that if one of
the three judges were of stronger
mind than the other two, so that he
could win them over to his opinion,
he should be allowed to do so. The
latter method is typically western,
while the former is the one used in
the large eastern debates. The
Stanford committee carried their
point.
Stanford proposed that hereafter
the debates be held on the
campuses, following the policy

adopted this year in athletics.
Berkeley strongly objected to this
and wished to debate the matter in
the next intercollegiate debate, pro
vided that Stanford should main
tain that campus debates are the
best and also be prepared to let the
decision in the debate be the final
decision as to the policy. Stanford
did not consider the subject to be
dignified enough to present to a San
Francisco audience in the big inter
collegiate debate between two great
universities, nor did they wish the
matter settled on any other
grounds than on pure merit, which
would be necessary if it was to go
to debate. The Stanford commit
tee did, however, agree to submit
the decision of the matter to any
arbitration board that might be
agreed upon. Berkeley would not
consent and there the matter now
stands, with no definite conclusion
reached.
Stanford proposed five judges in
stead of three, but acceded to
Berkeley's request that there be but
three.
Those constituting the committee
which drew up the agreement are
F. W. Aitken, J. T. O'Connor, and
R. T. Fisher of Berkeley, and A. H.
Suzzallo, '99, L. B. Wickersham,
'00, and Frank Adams,'ol, of Stan
ford. Further arrangements for
the debate will be carried on by
sub-committees on arrangements,
composed of Aitken and Wicker
sham, and on the selection of
judges, composed of O'Connor and
Adams.
The full text of the new agree
ment is:
