# Going to Japan.
## 
### 
J. F. Abbott, Zoology, '99, who
has been assistant librarian this
year, will soon leave the University
for Japan, probably sailing on the
City of Pekin on March 15th. He
goes directly to the Shinga Nikka
Nigaka, or the Prefectural College
of Omi, an institution correspond
ing to our State universities, located
at Otzu. This is a city of 38,000
inhabitants near Kioto. It is an
interesting fact that Abbott will be
the only white man in the city.
Abbott will succeed Spooner as
professor of English on April Ist,
the latter going to the School of
Foreign Languages at Tokio. Ab
bott goes under a year's contract
and beyond that time does not
know what his movements will be.
Outside of his work he will interest
himself primarily in a study of the
Japanese language and of the
zoology of the country. During the
vacation months of summer Abbott
and Spooner are planning an ex
cursion into Corea.
J. E. Healy, ex-'OO, who formerly
held the position, will return to
Abbott's place in the library. He
has returned to the University and
will assume his duties at once.
