# Friday Evening Reception.
## 
### 
The Christian Association gave
an enjoyable reception Friday at
the Inn. It was the regular semi
annual meeting, and was largely
attended. The event of the even
ing was the presentation of Professor
Hudson's farce, "Manifest Destiny,"
which was given recently at a fac
ulty reception at Dr. Jordan's. It
was a decided success, full of bright
lines and amusing situations.
Previous to the farce, Dr. Little
sang a solo, and the Girl's Mando
lin Club gave two numbers, "In
spired Melody," and as an encore,
"Hands Across the Sea." This is
the club's first appearance on the
campus this year, though they have
played several times in Palo Alto.
They have caught the vim and dash
of the Varsity club, and their num
bers Friday evening went excep
tionally well.
After the musical program re
freshments were served.
