# Encina Entertains Men.
## 
### 
The annual stag dance which was
held in Encina Clubroom Saturday
night was an unqualified success.
In point of attendance and in en
thusiasm it was ahead of anything
of the kind attempted heretofore,
and added to the club's reputation
as one of the prominent features of
Stanford life.
The program was varied and well
received throughout. It began with
an account by Ward all of the cap
ture by the Stanford volunteers of
the Filipino shield which now
hangs above the entrance to the
clubroom, and ended with a Vir
ginia reel, with music by Weil and
Copp. In addition to the regular
stag dances there were music by
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs, box
ing bouts, impersonations by Riley,
and solos by Rodolph.
