Encina Club has reason to con
gratulate itself on the success of its
annual Stag. Not only does this
institution serve to foster and
create undergraduate spirit, but it
offers an opportunity for the men
to meet on the common ground of
goodfellowship. Every Stanford
man loves Encina and the college
spirit for which the same stands,
and any organization to promote
its interests is one in which all of
us feel justly interested.
