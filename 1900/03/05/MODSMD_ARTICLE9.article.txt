The new intercollegiate debat
ing agreement decided upon last
Saturday, which appears on an
other page of this issue, is a. de
cided improvement over the agree
ments that have been in force in
the past. Not only is it more clear
cut and concise, but if there was
under the old system any advan
tage for one University over the
other, that advantage is eliminated
in the new instrument, and the de
bating interests of Stanford and
Berkeley placed on a more scien
tific and substantial basis than they
have been heretofore. The changes
proposed by the Stanford commit
tee were clearly fair and practical
and in the line of progress, and
now that they have been agreed
upon every Stanford debater should
feel new life for the contests of the
future. Our only regret is that no
decision was reached to take the
debates to the campuses in the fu
ture instead of holding them in
San Francisco, as in the past. Such
a move would have been, we think,
eminently wise. We acknowledge
that the proposition has two as
pects, but feel that there is a bal
ance in favor of taking forensic
as well as athletic contests to the
Universities. Clearly this matter
could not have been settled, as pro
posed by Berkeley, by arguing it
in the intercollegiate debate and

letting the decision of the judges
determine for all future time both
the winners of the debate and the
merits of the question. To do this
would be to act in direct opposition
to the agreement to have the judges
render their decision on the merits
of the debate. As to the willing
ness of our committee to leave the
matter to impartial judges, there
could be nothing fairer. There is
a chance of both Universities being
in error as to the best method of
procedure, and a competent arbi
tration board would determine this.
