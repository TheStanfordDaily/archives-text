# CORPORATION CHOSEN.
## Proposed Agreement Between Associated Students and the Training House Corporation. 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee yesterday afternoon
every member was present. The
principal business considered was
the relation of the proposed Train
ing House Corporation to the As
sociated Students and the election
of the members of the corporation.
The relation of the Training
House Corporation to the Associ
ated Students was defined in an
agreement, to be signed by both
parties or their representatives.
The salient features of the agree
ment are as follows:
ASSOCIATED STUDENTS.
The Associated Students agree:
(1) To pay to the Training House
Corporation the sinking fund as
provided for in the amendment to
the Constitution and By-Laws.
(2) Not to amend the Constitu
tion and By-Laws so as to lessen in
any way the amount of the sinking
fund provided for.
(3) To give such security as is
in its power for the contraction of
loans by the Training House Cor
poration.
TRAINING HOUSE CORPORATION.
In consideration of the above,
the Training House Corporation
agrees:
(1) To establish and erect a
training house and athletic field for
the use of the Associated Students.
(2) To submit plans and speci
fications of all buildings and sites
to the Associated Students or its
representatives.
(3) To use the moneys received
solely as a fund to secure a train
ing house and athletic field.
(4) To receive the written sanc
tion of the Associated Students be
fore borrowing money.
(5) To provide that its officers
shall act without compensation.
(6) To fill vacancies by electing
one of three candidates elected by
the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students.
(7) To turn over to the use of
the Associated Students said train
ing house and athletic field as soon
as completed.
(8) To submit complete reports
of financial and administrative
transactions to the Associated Stu
dents each semester.
The adoption of this agreement
as submitted by the Training House
Committee, and outlined in their
report, clears up the whole situation,
especially as to the one vital point
— the power to incur debt. Every
possible safeguard has been devised
to protect the interest of the Asso
ciated Students, as well as to insure
it the advantages of a corporation
acting in strict accordance with the
laws of California. Both the con
stitution and by-laws of the corpor
ation and the agreement between
the Associated Students and the
Training House Corporation were
drawn up by a competent corpora
tion attorney of San Francisco.
Having thus cleared up the
ground work the committee pro
ceeded to ballot upon the members
to be authorized to form the Train
ing House Corporation, with the

following result: 0. C. Leiter, '99,
Milnor Roberts, '99, J. E. McDowell,
'00, Henry H. Taylor, '00, T. J.
Hoover, '01, C. A. Cantwell, '01,
and J. Burt Gildersleeve, '02.
With this action, in case the
amendment proposed by the Ex
ecutive Committee providing for a
sinking fund is adopted, the further
work connected with the whole pro
ject will be carried on by a corpor
ation to be formed of the above
members. The whole matter is now
in the hands of the Associated Stu
dents, as upon their action in re
gard to the amendment depends
whether the project is to be pushed
forward or dropped completely.
The ratification of the engage
ment of the football coach for next
season was brought up but, on a
point of order, discussion was post
poned. A request was ordered to
be sent to the football manager and
the captain to be present at the
special meeting of the committee
tomorrow afternoon, when the mat
ter will probably come up for con
sideration.
