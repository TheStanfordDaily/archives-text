We sincerely regret being com
pelled to announce in another
column the probable resignation of
Robert VV. Hartwell from the posi
tion of editor-in-chief of the Se
quoia. Stanford's magazine has
maintained an efficiency under his
control that speaks best for the en
ergy and sincerity of his manage
ment. That continued ill health
has compelled him to permanently
depart from the University is a fact
deplored by both friends of the man
and supporters of the publication.
We wish him the greatest success
in whatever he may engage himself.
