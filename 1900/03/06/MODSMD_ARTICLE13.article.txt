The combination program which
will be given in the assembly hall
on the evening of Memorial Day
will be looked forward to with
much anticipation by every mem
ber of the University community.
This day is one which should have
a more decidedly characteristic ob
servation than has been the custom
in the past. It is a holiday all our
own, set apart for objects in which
Stanford people are alone peculiarly
interested. It lias been complained
that the commemorative exercises
do not draw the attention which
the day deserves, and their attend

ance has gone to prove the state
ment. It is a move in the right
direction when they are made more
popular and thus a greater interest
assured to keep fresh in our minds
the motives which prompted the
existence of our University.
