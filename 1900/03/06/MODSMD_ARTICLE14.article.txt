# "VISIONS OF THE BIBLE."
## The
						Sunday Sermon Delivered by Dr. McClish in the Chapel. 
### 
Dr. Eli McClish, president of the
University of the Pacific, delivered
the regular Sunday sermon in
the chapel on the "Visions of
the Bible." He said: ' Those of you
who remember the articles in the
newspapers just before the Colum
bian Exposition will recall that the
architects were greatly puzzled to
invent something which would
catch the eye of the public. France
had had her Eifel tower, London
her crystal palace, and it remained
for the architects to bring forth
something fitting for the great
American exposition. Mr. Ferris
acknowledged after the famous
wheel which bore his name had
been put in place that he had seen
the complete structure several
months before while at a banquet.
The vision then was just as clear
as the day when the last piece was
placed in position, and the great
mechanism was complete. What
a distance between the vision and
the completed article, â€”but without
the vision there would have been
no work and the Ferris wheel would
not have attracted wide-world at
tention.
"Every man who has come to
anything in life has had a vision
before him. Probably it is not as
clear as the one which Mr. Ferris
had, but still it is there. If you
find a man of commercial integrity,
and who is trusted by all, you will
probably find that in his boyhood
days he had a vision of honorable
and successful manhood, and that
this has been before him all through
his life. |
"Wherethere is no vision the peo
ple perish. In Africa the natives
live as they did a thousand years
ago. They have no vision of any
thing higher than mere existence.
As a consequence they live in the
same poor excuse for dwellings
which their forefathers used, and j
gain their food in the same crude j
manner that was pursued a thou-1
sand years ago, and which will be
pursued until they have a vision of
something better.
"Let me give you three warnings
in regard to the visions which you
entertain, and the way in which
you carry them out: first, never
cherish a vision not in accordance j
with the divine purpose, and after
this warning has been observed,
never cherish a vision which may
not be gained by divine means.)
Many visions, right in their pur
pose, fail because of the wrong
means used in trying to carry them I
out. After these two warnings have
been regarded, be patient. A mush
room is made in a night but it is
worth nothing when it is finished.
It takes five hundred years to make
an oak, fifteen hundred years to!
make a Gladstone or a Bismark. A j
great nation is not made in a day
or a year, and the world can not be
brought to Christ in an hour.''
