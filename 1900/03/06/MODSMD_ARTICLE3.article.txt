The assay laboratory has been
repaired since the recent fire, and
is running in full blast again. The
woodwork which was burned out
has been repaired and the windows
replaced.
A party of juniors from the dif
ferent Engineering departments of
the University visited the Union
Iron Works and other engineering
projects of interest last Saturday
under the guidance of Prof. C. B.
Wing. The party went directly to
the Union Iron Works, where they
remained the entire morning. The
machine shop was visited first,
where much interest was taken in
the big traveling cranes operated
by electricity and used to handle
large machine parts and transport
them from one part of the building
to the other. The pattern and
erecting shops, the foundry and
steel plant were then visited, also
the ship yard. Six ships are being
constructed, two torpedo boat de
stroyers, a coast defense monitor,
two battleships, and a large mer
chant freighter. The steel plates
were being put on the latter by
means of new compressed-air drills
and riveters. The party then vis
ited the hydraulic-lift drydock,
where the steamer Umatilla had
been docked and was being repaired.
In the afternoon the creosoting
plant of the Southern Pacific Com
pany at Oakland was visited. The
plant was in full operation and the
students were able to go through
the work in detail. The engineer in
charge described the process and
pointed out numerous interesting
points. The locomotive repair
shops and a ship yard were visited
on the way back to the city. At
the ship yard a breakwater had
been built out around the ways and
pumps were pumping the water out
so that the ways could be gotten at
