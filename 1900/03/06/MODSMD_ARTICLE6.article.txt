# Debating Question Explained.
## 
### 
F. W. Aitken, chairman of the
Berkeley intercollegiate debating
committee, today Bent to Stanford
an explanation of the question for
the intercollegiate debate which
came yesterday. The question, as
announced in last night's issue, is
"Resolved, That the army canteen
should be abolished." Mr. Aitken's
explanation is herewith given in
his own words:
"The word 'canteen,' used for
brevity, to be construed in the re
stricted sense which it has acquired
in popular discussion in this coun
try as referring to that feature of
the institution which pertains to
the sale, under control of the United
States military authorities, of in
toxicating liquors to soldiers." This
interpretation is to be subjoined to
the question as the statement of the
intention of the question.
