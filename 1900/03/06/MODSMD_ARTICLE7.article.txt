# Hartwell to Resign.
## 
### 
R. W. Hartwell, '00, editor of the
Sequoia, left today for Salinas,
where he will spend several weeks
with relatives. On returning he
expects to resign his position as ed
itor, and depart for his home in
Idaho. Hartwell has found that
the climate here does not agree with
him, and for that reason has de
cided to leave permanently. This
is a matter regretted by himself aB
well as by his many friends. Under
his direction the magazine has
maintained a high standard of ex
cellence.
L. MacF. Bowman, who has been
acting editor for some weeks, will
probably be appointed to succeed
Hartwell.
