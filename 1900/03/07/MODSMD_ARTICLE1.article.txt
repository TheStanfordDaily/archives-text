# GIFT TO THE "PALO ALTO."
## File of the First American Daily Published in the Philippines Sent to the University. 
### 
Franklin Brooks, ex-'96, at pres
ent studying law in San Francisco,
has presented the Daily Palo Alto
with two bound volumes of the
American, the first American news
paper printed in Manila, and of
which he was the first editor and
proprietor. Brooks was a Law
major while in the University and
was also an assistant editor on the
staff of the Daily Palo Alto,
where he gained his whole journal
istic experience. He went to Ma
nila as a civilian, arriving there
about the time of the capture of
Manila. He at once saw the
chance for an American daily news
paper and decided to start one.
The officials of the army and navy
were finally interested in the pro
ject and popular subscriptions
were raised to defray the heavy ex
pense of obtaining the Associated
Press cablegrams.
The first copy of the paper came
out October 15,1898, with Brooks
as editor-in-chief. The paper met
with success from the first. Brooks
continued at the head of the paper
from October 15, 1898, to January
1,1899, when, becoming involved
in a dispute with General Otis, he
was forced to retire from the actual
management of the paper although
he still continued as proprietor.
In a letter accompanying the vol
umes he tells the story of his con
nection with the paper and the
circumstances of its conception.
It is as follows:
"The type used in the printing of
the paper was an old Spanish font
of type found stored away in boxes
in a Spanish printing house. The
type was set by candle light. The
'editorial rooms' consisted at first
of two planks or boards placed
across boxes beside the printing
press, serving as a table; later an
outside kennel-shaped house, eight
by ten feet in area, was fitted up
with a table and two chairs inside.
"The first nine issues of the
American were published by the
editor alone, without any assistance
except the native Filipino type
setters. The copy had to he printed,
not written, so that the natives,
who never before saw English man
uscript, might be enabled to set the
type. Owing to the antiquated
methods of handling the type, often
after the copy was set up in type
and properly corrected, letters
would fall out and in replacing
them errors occur. The 'sticks'
used for setting the type only per
mitted one line to be set at a time.
These lines were removed by the
hands and placed beside each other
on a wooden encased board made
for the purpose, and thus line by
line was set up entirely separate,
until the whole copy was completed.
The natives, however, are very rapid
in their work. After three months'
experience in setting up English
copy, they work in their peculiar
way nearly as quickly as American
typesetters. The wages of the na
tive typesetter vary from .$4.50
Mexican silver, equal to one-half
American currency, to $14.50 Mex
ican silver per month. Today those

natives retained by the American
earn over double their former wages,
they being paid individually in
proportion to the amount of type set.
"The largest circulation of the
American for any one week was
5000 copies, and the lowest during
the month of February, 1899, the
beginning of the Filipino insurrec
tion, was 2200. The circulation av
erage to June 1, 1899, was 4000
copies daily. This is larger than
any of the English newspapers in
Japan or on the China coast.
"On the first day of January,
1899, ten weeks after the first issue,
the American occupied a two-story
building, especially suited to news
paper work. On April 30, 1899,
the paper was sold for $10,000."
The file of papers sent to the
Palo Alto will be placed in the li
brary.
