With the improvements which
will be kept up on our oval this
spring, it seems that an effort
should be put forth to make track
meets there more of a feature than
has been customary in the past.
We have not had enough track ath
letics heretofore to develop as strong
a sentiment as might be possible in
favor of them, and certainly not
enough to endanger what popular
ity they already have. This ap
plies to meets between other teams
as well as to those in which our
own men participate. It is one of
the surest ways to develop univer
sity athletics by encouraging a
start while men are in preparatory
schools. If our facilities for track
meets can be of any use to neigh
boring preparatory schools, we
should encourage taking advan
tage of them.
