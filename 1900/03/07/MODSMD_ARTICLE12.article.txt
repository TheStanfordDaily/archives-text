# ASKS ALUMNI SUPPORT.
## Provisions of Constitutional Amendment Explained. 
### 
George E. Crothers, president of
the Alumni Association of Stan
ford University, has sent to the
members of the association a circu
lar explanatory of Assembly Con
stitutional amendment No. 23,
which will be voted upon at the
general election next November.
The amendment adds a new section
to Article IX of the State Constitu
tion, confirming the founding of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, delegates certain powers to
its trustees, and authorizes the ex
emption of certain of its property
from taxation.
Mr. Crothers points out that the
fate of the amendment depends
upon the active interest of the indi
vidual alumni and friends of the
institution. They are assured that
every clause in the proposed
amendment is necessary to the
welfare of the University. Its pro
visions take the institution out of
the realm of doubt, placing it be
yond all possible litigation and af
ford the trustees powers which are
necessary to the proper discharge
of their duties.
The individual features are then
treated. It is pointed out that the
preliminary clauses not only re
move all doubt as to the validity of
the founding grants, but enable
Mrs. Stanford to confirm all grants
heretofore made. The conferring of
certain corporate powers upon the
trustees is necessary to facilitate
the management of the trust prop
erty. This can be done only by a
special act of the Legislature, which
requires constitutional authoriza
tion. By the terms of the amend
ment the Legislature is merely
authorized to confer such powers.
The proposed amendment does
not exempt or require the exemp
tion of any property from taxation.
Under its provisions the Legisla
ture need not make any exemption,
or it may make and repeal or limit
the exemption authorized. The
proposed amendment cannot work
a hardship upon any county or city,
since it does not authorize the ex
emption of local taxes upon any
other real property than the Palo
Alto ranch and the actual site of
any branch department. Under the
provisions of the amendment the
personal property endowment may
be exempted from local as well as
State taxation.
The only effect of taxing the
bonded endowment of the Univer
sity, according to the circular, has
been to limit it to Government
bonds, which are not taxed, at a
sacrifice of at least one-third of the
income.
It has been objected that the
amendment should have been gen
eral in its operation. Such an
amendment, it is explained, could
not have been adopted, and it would
not have benefited Stanford Uni
versity materially if it should have
been.
In consideration of having any
of the property exempted from tax
ation it is provided that the Uni
versity must offer free tuition to all
residents of California. —San Fran
