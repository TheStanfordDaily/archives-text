# Annual Handicap Field-Day.
## 
### 
The annual handicap field-day,
postponed from last Saturday, will
be held on the oval tomorrow after
noon. Besides the entries given in
last Thursday's Daily Palo Alto,
the following new entries have been
given: In the mile run, J. H. Stew
art and Baker; in the 440-yard
run, Hawley; and in the half-mile
run and 220 dash, John.
The track is in the best of con
dition owing to the recent rains,
and promises to be very speedy.
Upon the results of tomorrow's
contest rests the choice of those who
will go to Ukiah with the '01 team,
and those who will comprise the
Freshman team on its trip to Reno.
Immediately after the meet an elec
tion will be held for captains of the
Junior and Freshman teams.
Carl Morris, '01, who gave prom
ise of developing into a first class
distance man, will be unable to
compete this year on account of
sickness.
