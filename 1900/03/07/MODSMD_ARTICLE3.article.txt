# Dr. Fetter to Go East.
## 
### 
Dr. Frank O. Fetter, of the Eco
nomics department, will be absent
from the University during 1900-
1901. He has been granted a vaca
tion of one year, and expects to
start for the East in the latter part
of May. His plans are somewhat
unique,inasmuch as they do not in
clude travel or study except in the
United States. He already has
spent two years of graduate work
in Europe, and has come to the
conclusion that the best field for an
American to study social conditions
is found at home. Economic re
search is, in many respects, further
advanced in America than in any
other country.
After taking part in the National
Conference of Charities in Topeka,
I'rofessor Fetter will proceed to
Chicago where he will stay until
fall. The rest of his vacation will
be devoted to work in the Eastern
States in the observation of actual
conditions of industry and society,
in study in the Urge libraries, and
in acquainting himself with the
conditions of study in the East,
spending some time at Harvard,
Columbia, Yale, the University of
Pennsylvania, and Washington,
I). C.
Mrs. Fetter, who will accompany
her husband on the trip, will spend
the year at her old home near Phil
adelphia.

This vacation will fittingly cele
brate Dr. Fetter's sabbatical year of
academic teaching, he having spent
two years at Cornell, three years at
the University of Indiana, and two
years at Stanford.
