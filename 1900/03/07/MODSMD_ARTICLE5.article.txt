# Coolidge Returns.

### 
Dane Coolidge, '98, has returned
from an extended collecting trip in
Southern California. Coolidge was
sent to collect animals for several
eastern museums. He trapped a
large number of valley quail and
secured a number of eggs of the
golden eagle.
Probably the most valuable
find of Coolidge's trip, from a scien
tific standpoint, is a section of the
bone of an Ichthyosaurus, a pre
historic lizard-like animal of gi
gantic dimensions. This has been
turned over to Professor J. P. Smith
of the Geology department.
