The program of exercises for
Founder's Day is one that should
draw a good attendance. The music
promises to be exceptionally good,
and the address by Bishop Nichols
will be well worth hearing. The
memorial days are part of our uni
versity life, and attendance at the
exercises is simply a mark of re
spect to those to whom we owe the
existence of our University.
