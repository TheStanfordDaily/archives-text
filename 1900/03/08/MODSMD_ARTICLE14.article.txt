The debates last night gave as
much encouragement as could be
desired for the successful outcome
of our debating efforts this spring.
Over the finals of the Carnot pre
liminaries those held last night
were a marked improvement, not
especially in the work of those who
won places on the two teams, but
in the general tone of the efforts of
all. The interest shown by the
audience, too, was gratifying. We
have splendid chances ahead of us.
