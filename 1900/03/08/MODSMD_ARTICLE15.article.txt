Since an appeal for delay in the
ratification of a contract for a foot
ball coach has been made by such
a high official as the captain, it is
wise that the matter be definitely
settled by ihe highest authority —a
student body meeting. We believe
there can be but one outcome of
this action. The question is
squarely presented: Shall an ex
ecutive oflicer upon whom rests the j
responsibility for the football season
be sustained in an official act or I
not? A decision of this question in
the negative is really a vote of lack
of confidence and would be so con
sidered. We have no hesitation in
declaring that it is the duty of the
student body to sustain their foot
ball manager. He is the official |
whom the constitution makes pri- j
marily responsible for the outcome

of his season, and he must either be
sustained in his policy or com
pletely repudiated. Responsibility
without power cannot accomplish
results. Furthermore, as far as we
are able to judge, never has a field
of possible coaches been more care
fully considered than has that of
this year. As to whether the choice
made is the best or not, we may all
have our own opinions; but all of
us are not the ones who would bear
the responsibility for a defeat next
fall. The Executive Committee
have given the matter a careful
and impartial consideration. Every
student who casts a ballot to over
rule their action must realize that
he votes against sustaining the
clearly constitutional action of an
official of his own making.
