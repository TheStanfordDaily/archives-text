# Bicycle Lockers at Encina
## 
### 
The matter of a safe keeping of
bicycles is to receive attention from
the residents of the hall and pos
sibly later from the University au
thorities. Last year twenty wheels
were stolen from the campus and
the majority of these from Encina.
The plan to be proposed to relieve
this condition of affairs is for the
University to build bicycle lockers
in the basement, these to be rented
to students in a manner similar to
the gymnasium lockers. It is es
timated that there are about
seventy-five bicycles in the hall,
and that the owners of the majority
of these would be willing to pay a
dollar a semester for a safe place to
keep their wheels. The cost of
building the lockers and fitting them
with Yale locks would be about
$400 or $500.
