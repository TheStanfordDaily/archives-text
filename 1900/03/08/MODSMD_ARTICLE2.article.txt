Subject to the call of President

Coverley, the student body met in
special session at 1:15 this after
noon in room 50. After a reading
of the minutes by Secretary Adams
and of the proposed amendment to
the constitution by President Cov
erley, a motion for the adoption of
the latter was unanimously carried.
This amendment gives official stu
dent body sanction to the plans for
obtaining the proposed training
house.
Football Captain Burnett asked
for information as to the power of
the meeting to consider other ques
tions than that for which it was
called. He appealed from the de
cision of the Executive Committee
in their ratification of the contract
for next season's coach and asked
that action be postponed for ten
days in order that he might have
time to look over the field. Fisher,
'02, spoke against the appeal.
On motion of Nourse, '00, sec
onded by Leiter, '99, it was carried
that discussion of the question be
closed. Motions by Marrack, '01,
to suspend the ratification of the
Executive Committee, and by C. E.
Oilman, '01, to give Captain Bur
nett ten days for consideration of
the matter, were ruled out of order
by the chair.
It was announced by the chair
that a meeting of the Associated
Students would be held next Tues
day, March 11th, at 1:15 in the
chapel, if that place could be ob
tained.
