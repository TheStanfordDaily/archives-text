# DEBATING TEAM CHOSEN.
## Intercollegiate Finals Held in the Chapel Last Night Before a Large Audience. 
### 
The chapel was in total darkness
last night when the judges, after
thirty-five minutes of deliberation,
announced the names of those who
will be pitted against Berkeley in
the Intercollegiate debate in April.
The team will consist of Miss Anna
Fraser, '00, Cecil M. Marrack, '01,
and J. E. Springer, '00. The sec
ond team, which will aid the first
team in preparation, and from
which an alternate will be chosen
one week before the final contest, is
made up of J. F. English, '01, C.
A Quayle, '00, and F. B. Wag
ner, '03.
Twelve speakers contested in these
finals. They were assigned evenly
to two debates, the question of each
debate being, Resolved, That Eng
land's War Policy in South Africa
is Justifiable." In the first debate
Wagner, '03, Marrack,'ol, and Eng
lish, '01, spoke for the affirmative,
and Miss Fraser, '00, Morris, '01,
and Quayle, '00, for the negative.
Holly, '00, Springer, '00, and Mer
ritt, '03. represented the affirmative
in the second debate, and Scott,'o2,
Copp, '02, and Riddell, '01, the neg
ative. It was not a hard matter to
pick the debaters who had won
places on the team, but the person
nel of the second team was not so
easy to determine.
Miss Fraser is the only member
of the trio who is an unknown
quantity to the audiences which
have listened to former Stanford-
Berkeley debates. She has, how
ever, participated in various pre
liminaries and finals, was alternate
on this year's Carnot team, and is
fully capable of taking care of her
share of the work. Combined with
a persuasiveness and enthusiasm
which is peculiarly feminine, she
possesses a masculine mastery of
argument and forceful delivery.
C. M. Marrack, besides being one
of this season's Carnot debaters,
was on the Sophomore team that
defeated the Freshman last year..
In his speech last night he very
effectively turned his opponent's
points to account, answering them
one by one, and, on the offensive,
he put forth a convincing argument
to show that England's policy has
been justified by her purpose.
J. E. Springer is a veteran of
three intercollegiate contests, and,
one of the strongest debaters Stan
ford ever had. His record is too
well known to need repeating here.
Of the second team, English was
one of the Carnot debaters this
year, Quayle has taken part in sev
eral finals, and Wagner was a mem
ber of this year's victorious Fresh
man team.
The judges last night were Pro
fessors Fetter, Newcomer, and Ross.
Professor Lathrop presided, and
M. C. Decarli, '00, acted as time
keeper.
