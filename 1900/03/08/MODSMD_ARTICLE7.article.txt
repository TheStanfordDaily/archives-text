# Senior Benefit Play.
## 
### 
It is possible that Sword and
Sandals will put on the local stage
in April or May Home copyrighted
play of recognized standing. The
desire for some creditable student
production other than the regular

class farces and vaudeville is very
general, and the Senior Class presi
dent suggested that the club stage
some play under the auspices and
patronage of the class, the latter
bearing the major expenses of the
undertaking and taking one-half
the proceeds. The proposition has
met with favor, and if time can be
found the men will act upon it.
One of the club members owns a
half interest in the manuscript of
" The Private Secretary," Lillet's
great comedy, and it may be se
cured. The members of the society
are now busy with the Junior cast,
and will probably soon be at work
on the Senior vaudevilles. If there
is time, however, a more ambitious
play will be put on by the club.
