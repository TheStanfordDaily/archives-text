# FOUNDER'S DAY.
## Impressive Memorial Exercises Held in the Assembly Hall Last Friday Evening. 
### 
Founder's Day was fittingly cele
brated last Friday evening by exer
cises in the assembly hall. The
musical part of the program was
exceptionally fine. Both Mr. Sa
vannah and Mr. Fickenscher sus
tained the reputations which they
have made before Stanford au
diences on previous occasions.
The opening concerto afforded an
opportunity to observe the fine
bowing and clear, precise touch,
which is characteristic of Mr. Sa
vannah's playing. While lacking
the abandon which is essential to
the most impressive work, both this
piece and the romance which fol
lowed it were characterized by
great breadth of tone and warm
color. Mr. Fickenscher, with most
admirable precision and mastery
of technique, delighted the audience
with two numbers from Liszt. One
of these, in particular, the " Dance
of the Gnomes,'' a weird, fasci
nating little thing, exhibited great
variation in light and shade. In
his accompanying, too, Mr. Ficken
scher showed much sympathy. The
Rubenstein sonate with which Mr.
Savannah closed the program, was
played with good feeling.
The address of the evening was
given by Bishop Nichols of San
Francisco. He spoke on "Charac
ter."
" Good men differ," he said,
"upon almost everything but good
ness itself. And they differ widely
in their theories as to that. But
they always agree upon the speci
men when they find it. As experts
they pass upon it with one verdict,
whether they come from the nine
teenth century before or after
Christ, whether the goodness is
formulated in studied scholastic
phrase or in the passing conversa
tion, whether the tribute is paid in
the preaching of pure righteousness,
or in the roll of high personal esti
mate in the critical world of the
undergraduate. A common article
of belief in all creeds and schools
and centers of thought is the ex
pressed or implied conviction about
character.
"Addressing myself, then, to that
earnest-mindedness which I believe
to be in this academic atmosphere,
my plea is that there is a grand op
portunity to make the department
of character a very strong one here.
The words of Founder's Day I have
quoted, and not words of two or
three or more centuries ago, to reach
us in faint and uncertain echoes,
like some of the older foundations
at centers of university life, but
words not ten years old, —put the
ambition in the very charter. They
really imply that the true 'major'
study of every one should be in the
department of character.
"And if the voice of one of the
founders is now stilled in death,
and she who is left is day by day
sweetening the solace of memory of
husband as well as of son with pure
and sacred devotion to every inter
est of this great enterprise, it is
fitting that I should recognize here
on thin Memorial Founder's Day,
how detply in all her thought and

plans, how constantly in her con
versation and concern is this de
partment of character. And the
uprearing walls of that noble
chapel, which is to crown this quad
rangle, testify to her yearning fore
thought, as they point in prophecy
to the vast scale of opportunity for
the sphere of the spiritual in sound
character growth. It gives the de
partment of character the costliest
and most inspiring lecture room of
all. It makes the house of worship
a worthy court of the Most High
God, adorned and dignified for his
presence. Its atmosphere is de
signed like one in which humanity
is to feel an uplift. Its full conse
quence to character may well be
that described by the late president
of a great eastern university to one
of its greatest alumni —'in the
sanctuary of the inner self an ever
dwelling, prayerful, magnanimous,
loving spirit toward God and man.'
"And if we were to suggest a text
for its walls to point its purpose, it
would be 'Concerning spiritual
gifts, brethren, I would not have
you ignorant.' "
