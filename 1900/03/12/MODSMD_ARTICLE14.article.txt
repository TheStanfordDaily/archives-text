## Instructor Parsons Delivers the Regular Sermon on "Communion With God." 
### 
Rev. Edward Parsons, Instructor
in Philosophy, delivered the Sun
day address in the chapel, choosing
as a text Ephesians ii: 18: "For
through Him we both have access
by one spirit unto the father." He
said: "I wish to speak this morn
ing on the truth that we obtain our
access through the spirit to God.
Of course I take it for granted that
every man wishes to obtain that
access. All the investigations and
problems of the universe are con
sciously or unconsciously the seek
ings after the hidden God.
"We would like to find behind
the universe, behind history, be
hind our own thoughts and feelings
a real certainty of God, all-seeing
and all-knowing. We believe, yet
we cannot see. Now the thought I
wish to suggest is that we may find
this approach to God through the
spirit. By spirit I do not mean
any theological spirit, but the spirit
as the capacity for the highest
things. So we say the soul that
possesses such a spirit when ap
proached by things high or noble
leaps out to such nobler things in
sympathy and communion. A man
who possesses this spirit must look
to the highest and interpret the
lower from such a judgment.
"Freedom is higher than neces
sity; love higher than law and or
der; nature seems to present herself
pitiless in her laws, but if these
things are higher than the laws of
man, you cannot look at the world
as cold or mechanical. There must
be something behind this. You
see what it means. It only means
that we are to interpret the things
of the world in terms of love, in
terms of freedom, in terms of mercy
and of sympathy.
"We are not satisfied to merely
feel that there is a God, but we
want to feel that there is a God
working in and through us. Now,
the spirit is that which puts us in
touch with the things of God Him
self. If our thoughts and emo
tions are not in harmony with God
we have not this sympathy which
brings us into communication with
Him.
Sometimes we are lifted up onto
a high plane and feel that we are
in a presence not our own. Such
experiences come to many of us.
They may come in a moment of
prayer, and you feel that you have
reached the source of life. If this
is a true experience, and I think it
is, we approach God through the
spirit.
"This is of course mysticism, but
mysticism means only that we are
lifted up into the truth that we feel
we know is not our own truth,
but is divine. The man who has
such experiences finds himself more
in touch with nature and his fel
low men and more truly himself a
man. It is for us then to nurture
the spirit, to cherish the highest
and noblest things, and through
cherishing these better things find
ourselves lifted up to communion
with God."
