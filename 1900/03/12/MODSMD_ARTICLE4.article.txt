# ON THE DIAMOND
## Varsity Wins the Saturday Game from the Fireman's Team by a Close Margin. 
### 
The Varsity defeated the Fire
men Saturday for the first time
this season. The final winning
score was 3-2, not a large margin.
This is the last scheduled game
with the Firemen and, though the
Varsity succeeded in winning, there
must be a decided brace in team
work before the intercollegiate
matches take place. The city
men brought in their two runs
through Stanford's errors and near
the end seemed about to win out.
Lanagan, however, found his man
and took away the Firemen's last
chance.
Krug did not hold down the box
for the insurance team and this
probably gave the Varsity a lead,
as Moskimon struck out but six
men as compared to Lanagan's
ten.
The men who put up the best
ball for the Varsity were Lanagan,
Lougheed, and Strobn.
