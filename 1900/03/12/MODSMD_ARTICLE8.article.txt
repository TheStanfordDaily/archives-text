# Junior Class Picture.
## 
### 
The Class of 1901 will be photo
graphed for the Annual tomorrow
at 4 p.m. on the museum steps.
The editors of the Quad plan some
thing entirely new in the way of a
class picture, and in order to make
it a success a full attendance of the
class is desired. Every one who
can should he present, and on time,
and every man must wear his plug.
