# To Study at Ann Arbor.
## 
### 
Instructor T. A. Storey of the
Hygiene department expects to
leave early in May to be absent
during the summer vacation. His
time will be spent at Ann Arbor,
Michigan, in carrying on special
investigation along the line of vol
untary muscular contractions.
The work is to be done under the
direction of Dr. Warren P. Lom
bard, who has charge of the phys
iological laboratory of the Univer
sity of Michigan. Dr. Lombard
has done more work in this partic
ular line of experiment than any
other physiologist, with the pos
sible exception of Niossa and Niag
giora at Turin, Italy.
