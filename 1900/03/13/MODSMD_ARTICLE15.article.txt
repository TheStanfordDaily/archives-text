We print a communication
from the librarians touching on an
abuse of the open system which
was adopted with the occupation of
the new building. This is a matter
which may cause a withdrawal of
the privilege unless the students
themselves attend to its rectifica
tion. We hope the unfairness of
their action will be brought home
to those guilty of the abuse and no
stronger means will be necessary
on the part of the officials than
the request now given.
