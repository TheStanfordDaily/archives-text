The conciliatory spirit shown
at this afternoon's student bod}-
meeting was a complete rebuke to
those who have been determined
to make out of a difference of opin
ion an irreparable breach between
our football authorities. When
the captain said that unity in the
student body is more desirable for
success than any other one thing,
he voiced a sentiment which
touched the college spirit of every
one present, and showed that we
have a man in charge of affairs on
the gridiron who holds his Univer
sity above anything else in his
efforts for success next season.
With complete harmony between
all parties assured, Stanford stands
in a fair way to progress towards
victory on the football field.
