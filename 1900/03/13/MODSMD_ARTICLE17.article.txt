# From the Library.

### 
A number of books have been
known to disappear from the
shelves of the reference room at
different times. In adopting the
partial open-shelf system the li
brarians were confident that stu
dents would appreciate its advan
tages and make no wrong use of
the privilege given. There is no
pleasure in devising means for
checking irregularities or in ap
plying those means. The student
body has shown itself so helpful to
the library in its hours of need
that we cannot begin to cure an
evil before we fail in an appeal to
the students' better sense.
The library has such a large
number of readers to serve that it
is necessary to remind the individ
ual who is thoughtless of his neigh
bors and of the fact that one man's
right ends where the other man's
begins—that he has neighbors, and
that others have rights. The re
moval of books from the library
without giving notice to the proper
officers is contrary to the interests
of the general readers, who have to
be protected in their right to the
use of books.
