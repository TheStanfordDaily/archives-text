### 
A party of scientists is being or
ganized at Harvard who will com
mence work about the middle of
May in an endeavor to discover
definitely whether or not a planet
exists between Mercury and the
sun. Prof. W. H. Pickering of the
department of astronomy at Har
vard will lead the expedition and
will also bear a large part of the ex
pense personally. The Harvard Ob
servatory has loaned Professor
Pickering a large number of astro
nomical instruments and will fur
nish him with whatever special ap
paratus he needs. H. W. Atwell of
the University faculty will assist
him.
There is a general belief that such
a planet exists and in regard to the
matter Professor Pickering says:
"It is only because I believe that
the time, apparatus, and the meth
ods justify a belief that such a dis
covery may be made that I have
given my approval to Harvard Ob
servatory contributing from its
fund toward the expedition." â€”Yale
Neivs.
