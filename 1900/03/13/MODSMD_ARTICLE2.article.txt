The chapel was nearly filled at
1:30 this afternoon, when President
Coverley called the student body
meeting to order. After a reading
of the minutes by Secretary Adams,
the object of the meeting was stated
to be the consideration of Foot
ball Captain Burnett's appeal from
the decision of the Executive Com
mittee in ratifying Manager Gilder
sleeve's contract with F. H. Yost as
football coach for next season.
Captain Burnett arose, and in an
encouraging speech upon the neces
sity for unity, withdrew his appeal.
His remarks were enthusiastically
applauded. Treasurer Leiter moved
that the controversy be de
clared closed, and the motion was
unanimously carried. With this the
meeting adjourned, and a vigorous
Stanford yell showed that Leiter's
motion was accepted in fact as well
as in law.
