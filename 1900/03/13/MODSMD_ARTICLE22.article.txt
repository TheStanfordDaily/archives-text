# Concert at Los Gatos.
## 
### 
The musical clubs filled their
date at Los Gatos Friday, giving a
jolly, good-natured entertainment
to a jolly, good-natured crowd,
which filled the auditorium of the
spacious Methodist church. The
audience, besides the townspeople,
was composed to a considerable ex
tent of fruit-growers and ranchers,
who drove in from the surrounding
country. This is the second con
cert the clubs have given in Los
Gatos in the last three years, and
on both occasions the town has
shown itself thoroughly for Stan
ford.
The musicians drove to LosGatos
in a big bus with six horses, and re
turned the same evening after the
program, reaching the campus at
about 3:30 a.m. The country tra
versed was very beautiful, but the
ride was very tiresome in a crowded
carryall. There were many amus
ing features of the concert, one of
them being the use of a big, solemn
pipe organ as the accompaniment
for the rollicking specialty songs, in
the absence of a piano. The club
cleared about $35. The next con
cert is at San Mateo on Friday even
ing.
