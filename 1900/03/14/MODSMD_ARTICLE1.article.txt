# "COSMOPOLITAN" DECISION.
## C.M. Bradley Wins the Essay Contestâ€”Alteration of the Original Plans. 
### 
C. M. Bradley won the Walker
Cosmopolitan prize of $100 for the
best essay on "What order of
studies is best suited to fit the aver
age man for his duties in the world
of today?"
According to the original plan
offered by Mr. Walker to the uni
versities of the country, there were
to be university contests, the win
ners of these contests to receive
$100; and a grand contest to be
held at Harvard, at which the win
ners of the university contests were
to compete for a prize of $300.
This plan fell through because the
authorities at Harvard were not
consulted before the announcement
of the competition appeared. They
refused to allow Mr. Walker to hold
it at Harvard because they deemed
the subject offered as too indefinite
ly stated to be worthy of the stu
dents'consideration. The Harvard
authorities were justified in their
stand by a great majority of the
college presidents throughout the
country. In fact, Stanford is the
only large institution that accepted
the conditions of the prize.
The judges, in reaching a de
cision in the Stanford contest, ex
perienced the difficulty pointed out
by President Eliot of Harvard,
namely, that the question was too
broad and too indefinite to allow
the contestants to write a creditable
essay. The articles handed in
showed this fault; they gave evi
dence of careful thought, but did
not reach anything worthy of se
rious consideration.
The judges were : Dr. J. C. Bran
ner, Professor Hudson, Professor
Murray, Professor McGown, F. J.
Symmes of the Thomas Day Co.,
M. F. Pixley of the Examiner, J. S.
Hutchinson, and G. W. Dickie,
foreman of the Union Iron Works.
Of the nine contestants who tried
for the prize, H. W. Grunsky, '99, was
the only one besides the winner to
receive favorable mention.
Mr. Bradley, the winner, is a
member of the Junior Class, and
has English as a major. He en
tered Stanford from the Tacoma
High School with the class of '99.
He has held the positions of assist
ant, associate, and managing editor
on the Daily Palo Alto, and in
his sophomore year was editor of
Josh. In his junior year he was
editor of his class annual and of
the comic department of the Se
quoia.
In the second semester of his
junior year he left college to be
come a reporter on the San Fran
cisco Chronicle. He remained with
that paper until last fall, when he
entered the University again and
became a member of the '01 class.
