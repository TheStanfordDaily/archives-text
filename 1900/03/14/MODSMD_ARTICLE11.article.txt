The Press Club is inaugurating
a good movement when it takes the
college comic paper under its pro
tection and guarantees to its sub
scribers a regular issue. From
now on the paper ought to be a
success, as the members of the club
have talent to put forth a first-class
paper, worthy of comparison with
any college paper of its kind in the
country. We join with the Uni
versity public in wishing the Press
Club success in its new venture.
