The proposal of the track man
agement to offer a silver cup for an
inter-class meet which shall be con
tested for each year is an idea
which deserves adoption in all de
partments of athletics. Remark
has often been made on the value of
class contests and the general en
thusiasm to which they lead. It is
well recognized that no intercol
legiate sport can be on a firm
foundation unless it is a popular

one at the University itself. In
accomplishing this result class con
tests find their chief justification,
and to make them successful no
better means can be adopted than
the establishment of annual cups.
The holding Â©112 the trophy by a
class throughout its four years
would become an honor which,
when once accomplished, would be
sought by every succeeding class,
and thus an indirect but strong in
centive given to the general devel
opment of that particular sport.
The idea once started, we hope to
see its adoption, as far as practical,
by all athletic managers.
