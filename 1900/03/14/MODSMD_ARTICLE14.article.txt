# TUESDAY EVENING LECTURE.
## Professor Miller Tells How He Became a Greek Officer. 
### 
Prof. Walter Miller delivered the
regular Tuesday evening lecture on
the subject, "How I Became a Cap
tain in the Greek Army." He be
gan his lecture with a description
of the Greece of today as compared
with ancient Greece. " Ancient
Greece," he said, "comprised about
30,000 square miles of territory, an
area about half that of the State of
Maine. The modern kingdom is of
exactly the same area, bounded by
the same limits for which Demos
thenes spoke. The products are
also the same—grapes and wine,
olives, lemons, and oranges being
the staples. Above all, the people
are the same. It might be expected
that the great influx of the foreign
peoples who have conquered Greece
would mix with the natives and
destroy the purity of the race. But
this is not the case, for the Greek
considers himself superior to any
one else, and would disdain to
marry a barbarian, as they still call
everybody who does not belong to
their own nationality.
"Positive proofs of the purity of
the Greek race are found in the
classic regularity of the faces of the
people, but most of all, in the lan
guage, which, with a few changes
caused by the necessity of the
times, is exactly the same as that
spoken by Alcibiades or Homer."
Professor Miller then told of an
adventure with some Greek bandits,
while he was traveling in Greece in
1893, in which he was robbed and
left for dead; recovering after some
hours of insensibility, he walked a
number of miles, finally arriving at
Athens, where he was . made the
captain of a company of soldiers
sent out to look up the offenders.
After some days of search the ban
dits were found and given over to
justice, receiving their well merited
punishment.
