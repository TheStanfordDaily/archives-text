—There is an effort being made
at Michigan to have the work on
her intercollegiate debates count
towards a degree.
—A number of young American
college men have been chosen by
the authorities of the Paris Exposi
tion to act as guides, interpreters,
and guards at the Exposition
grounds. Most of the men have
already sailed for Paris in order to
acquaint themselves with their du
ties.
—An appeal has been made by
Prof. Andrew F. West of Princeton,
who is chairman of the Endowment
Committee of the American School
at Rome, for a preliminary endow
ment of $100,000 and a suitable
building to carry on the work, for
which latter $30,000 has already
been contributed. Professor West
estimates that at least $500,000 is
needed to put the American School
on a footing with the best school
established by other countries in
Rome.
