The Junior Clas« track team will
leave the University next Friday
to contest with the Ukiah high
school team in a field meet next Sat
urday on the latter's grounds. The
men will remain over in Santa
Rosa Friday night and go on to
Ukiah Saturday morning. The
field-day will come off in the after

noon. First and second places
will count three and one points
respectively.
The '01 athletes are Foster, Ben
nett, Wardall, Harter, and Law
rence, in the field events; Bowman,
Talbot, Borough, Ferrari, and
Cantwell, in the sprints and dis
tance runs. Harter and Lawrence
will also go into the sprints.
Last year the result of the con
test between these two teams was a
tie. This year the high school boys
have an excellent chance to throw
the balance in their favor by win
ning out a victory, as the Junior
team will be under a heavy handi

Stewart, Strout, and Symonds,
three of their best men.

had its strongest team, but only
one man who won a point in that
field-day remains with them. The

can win.
