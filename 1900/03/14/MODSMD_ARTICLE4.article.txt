# DEBATE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
## Berkeley's Arbitrary Stand Acceded to by Our Intercollegiate Committee. 
### 
It has been finally decided that
the Intercollegiate Debate for this
year shall be held in San Fran
cisco as heretofore and a communi
cation to this effect was today
forwarded to Berkeley. As an
nounced before, the Stanford com
mittee has made a strong plea for
campus debates and the Berkeley
committee has been opposed to
them, maintaining that at least
one intercollegiate contest should
remain in San Francisco, and
above all the great intellectual
contest of the year.
At the last meeting of the Inter
collegiate Debating Committee the
place for holding the debates was
left undecided, but since then sev
eral letters have passed between
the committees, with the result that
Stanford has acceded to Berkeley's
request to keep the debate in San
Francisco this year. This action
was taken by the representatives
of the Cardinal only after full con
sideration of the case and to pre
vent a deadlock. Furthermore, the
Stanford committee maintained
that they are in the right and that
the debates as well as the athletic
contests should take place on the
college grounds. In communicat
ing with the Berkeley committee
they explicitly stated that the
matter will come up again at some
future time and that, in considera
tion of Stanford's magnanimity in
the matter, the Berkeley committee
will next time be expected to take
a more generous stand.
The date for the debate has not
yet been decided upon, but it will
be within a short time.
