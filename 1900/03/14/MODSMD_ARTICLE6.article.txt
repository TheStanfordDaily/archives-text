# Press Club's New Venture.
## 
### 
Last Thursday, at the business
meeting held after the annual din
ner to new members, the Press Club
talked over the advisability of un
dertaking the editorial and business
management of the Chaparral. At
that meeting a committee, consist

ing of Leiter, '99, Bradley, '01, Erb,
'01, Gildersleeve, '02, and llas
lacher, '00, was appointed to inves
tigate the status of the paper. At
a special meeting held in Encina
last night the committee reported
the paper to be upon a paying
basis. They reported further that
they had made inquiries which led
them to believe that under the aus
pices of the Press Club the Chapar
ral could be brought up to the high
standard that Josh maintained. In
a formal vote the members present
decided to assume the responsibility
of issuing the Chaparral.
The plan upon which the club
will control the paper is a stock
company, to which all the members
will belong. The business manage
ment and editorial staff will be
composed of members of the Press
Club. The first issue under the
new management will come out on
Junior Day, and once every two
weeks thereafter.
Tomorrow the Press Club will
meet and perfect plans of the cor
poration.
