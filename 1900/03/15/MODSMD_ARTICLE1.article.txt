# JUNIOR DAY FARCE.
## Cast of Characters Which Will Present This Year's Melodrama. 
### 
The melodrama which is to be
given Junior Day eve, Thursday,
March 29th, by the Class of 1001, is
rapidly Hearing perfection. The
cast has entered into the spirit of
tlie lines and situations of the
clever piece of burlesque, and the
first production of a melodrama at
Stanford shows every indication of
being a marked success. The
ridiculously ultra-dramatic tone of
the play is a great mirth provoker,
and will recall to the adventurous
spirit a night in Morosco's loft,
"just for the fun of the thing."
The University authorities have
extended to the class the use of the
new assembly hall, and this will be
the maiden performance in that
splendid auditorium. "All But
Two" will be presented to the pub
lic with new scenery and stage fit
tings. The scenery will be selected
under the direction of George Lask
of the Tivoli theatre in San Fran
cisco.
The cast in "All But Two" will
be the largest ever handled on a
Stanford stage, with sixteen voice
parts to say nothing of both heavy
and light thinking parts. The chief
roles will be carried by such well
known local talent as Frank
Branch Riley, the heavy villain; J.
G. DeForest, the dress-suit villain;
William Erb, Swedish character
part; Bristow Adams, the long suf
fering heroine; Miss Emabelle
Zucker, the indispensable ingenue;
Miss Christina Rose, the match
making chaperone. William Erb,
'01, is directing the stage manage
ment.
