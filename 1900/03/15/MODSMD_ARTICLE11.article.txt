It is a fact sincerely to be re
gretted that circumstances made it
necessary for our intercollegiate
debating committee to this year
give up their demand for campus
debates. Their stand was but part
of the movement toward putting
all contests between the two uni
versities upon a firmer student
basis. That it is bound to be
adopted in the near future there
can be but little doubt, and it
seems most unfortunate that it was
so arbitrarily opposed this year.
With the track meet to be held
here and the accommodations we
have lately acquired through our
assembly hall, Stanford could cer
tainly make a most brilliant suc
cess of the day. San Francisco
undoubtedly needs better acquaint
ance with the two universities, as
the Berkeley committee contended,
but the students themselves are the
first ones to be considered, and that
they appreciate the holding of a
debate on their own grounds is
fully evidenced by the success of the
annual Carnot contests. We trust

our committee will not abate its
endeavors to establish the custom
and that next year, when it is not
a question of coming to Palo Alto,
the Berkeley representatives may
be made to appreciate the advisa
bility of the movement.
