# To Lecture at Institutes.
## 
### 
Prof. Ellwood P. Cubberley of the
Education department will be
absent from the University during
the Easter vacation delivering lec
tures at the teachers' institutes at
lliverside and San Bernardino. Me
succeeded in starting some work
along the line of school manage
ment at these places a year ago
with studies from a text-book and
syllabus. He will now go to direct
the further continuance of this work
and will probably deliver some mis
cellaneous lectures on general edu
cational topics at each of the insti
tutes which he expects to visit.
