# To Lecture in Sonoma County.
## 
### 
Dr. C. A. Duniway of the His
tory department has been invited
to lecture before the Teachers' In
stitute of Sonoma county, which
meets early in April. He has ac
cepted the invitation, and will
speak along the line of historical
study. As the Institute meets after
the Easter vacation, Dr. Duniway
will probably be absent from the
University for a day or two while
filling his engagement there.
