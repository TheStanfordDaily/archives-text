# Tennis Try-Outs.
## 
### 
As announced yesterday, Man
ager Hardy has decided not to hold
the practice tournament next Sat
urday, but to have only a final try
out, to be held the first Saturday
after the Easter vacation. This
will bring it on April 14th. If
there are too many contestants to
allow the tournament to be run off
in one day, it will be continued on
the following Monday afternoon.
It has not been decided whether
entries for the doubles will be made
by teams or individually. If
Weihe, '03, becomes strong enough
by that time, after his recent ill
ness, he and Hardy, '02, will un
doubtedly enter together, as they
would make the strongest team.
All entries for both singles and
doubles, accompanied by a fee of
fifty cents to partially cover ex
penses, must be handed to Manager
Hardy by Thursday noon, April
12th. The drawings will be an
nounced in that evening's paper.
