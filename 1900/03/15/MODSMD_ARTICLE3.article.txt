# Notice to Football Men.
## 
### 
The football management would
like the co-operation of the football
men of the University in the matter
of having their measurements
taken. This is something which
can be done now, if the men are
willing, and a great deal of time be
saved next fall. J. J. I'tister it Co.
have very kindly offered to measure
the men free of all charge. This
will placc us in readiness to send

an order to the city as soon as it
should be necessary, and will aid
greatly in sorting over and mark
ing by sizes the old football outfits.
Below is given a list of men who
played last year and who will un
doubtedly be back next year. This
list is very likely incomplete and

the management by presenting
their names before Monday noon,
