### 
Frank W. Aitken, chairman of
the Berkeley intercollegiate debat
ing committee, this afternoon sent
to Stanford two questions for the
Intercollegiate debate. Although
nothing was said in the telegrams
as to the purpose of sending more
than one question, it is presumable
that we are offered a choice of the
two for a substitute for the "Army
Canteen" question, which they sent
over a week ago, but have since
asked to withdraw. Fuller advices
are promised by mail.
Following are the questions sub
mitted :
" Resolved, That the guarantees
of the Constitution should extend
to all persons and territory under
the permanent control of the United
States, except to persons living in
tribal relations."
" Resolved, That Porto Rico
should be immediately included
within the customs boundaries of
the United States.''
