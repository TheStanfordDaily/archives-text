It is to be regretted that the
final question for the intercollegi
ate debate submitted by the Berke
ley committee is so vague. The

be placed upon the uncertain parts

as a substitute for the "Canteen"

Stanford is always ready to debate
some issue that is stated in terms
which cannot be misconstrued, but
her representatives are not willing
to enter into a contest that must
end in quibbling over the meaning
of the subject under discussion.
Let us debate an issue, not the
meaning of words.
