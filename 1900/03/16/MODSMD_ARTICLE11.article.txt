Tomorrow the Juniors meet
Ukiah high school and the Fresh
man track team meets Oakland
high school. These are the first of
the preparatory contests which
the manager has arranged to pre
pare us for the intercollegiate field
day. Their results are bound to
be beneficial in every way, and,
since one of them is to be held
here, the students at large have an
opportunity, by attendance, to
show that they are in fact behind
the new track movement this

spring. A big crowd tomorrow
will serve both to give our prepara
tory school visitors a welcome and
to encourage track ambitions
among our own athletes.
