# Strength Tests.

### 
In a recent test of strength at the
University of Chicago, A. W. Place
broke all previous records by regis
tering a total of 4238 pounds in the
various tests applied. With the
machine to test the muscles of the
chest he registered 270 pounds; on
the straight pull for the strength of
the muscles of the back he lifted the
machine until it registered 1010
pounds; the weight lifted in the leg
test equaled 1555 pounds, and in
the tests for the biceps and triceps
he was equally successful in eclips
ing all previous records. A few
days before this test was made Wal
ter S. Kennedy, the football cap
tain, had broken previous records,
but Place, though a much smaller
man, exceeded Kennedy's mark by
137 pounds. Medical experts have
been astounded by the wonderful
strength exhibited by Place. He is
but 22 years of age, and weighs less
than 170 pounds.
