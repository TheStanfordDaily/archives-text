# Debating Question.
## 
### 
Further correspondence with
Berkeley on debating matters
has not served to simplify them
much. This morning a dispatch
was received, stating that the
"Puerto Rico" question received
last night and printed in last
night's issue was sent through a
misunderstanding and that the
one open to our debates is that re
ferring to the guarantees of the
Constitution. Partial interpreta
tions of thi.s question came this
morning by mail and, together
with these, the full question now
reads as follows:
"Resolved, That the guarantees
of the Constitution should extend
to all persons and territory under
permanent control of the United

States, except to persons living in
tribal relations." The phrase,
"guarantees of the Constitution" is
understood to include not only the
securities for personal liberty, but
also the provision, "but all duties,
imports, and excises shall be uni
form throughout the United States."
(Art. I, Section 8.)
The Stanford debaters are unable
to tell from the wording of this
question just what the Berkeley
committee wishes to discuss. It
was therefore decided to ask for
further light, which was done in
the following telegram sent this
afternoon:
"Please define word 'should' in
question submitted. Is essence of
question whether Constitution does
actually so extend, or, waiving
that, is it a question of desirable
policy ? "
