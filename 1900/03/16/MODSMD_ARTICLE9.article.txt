The efforts being put forth by
the faculty ladies and the Students'
Guild to establish a woman's
sitting room deserve more than a
passing notice. That the improve

evinced by the complaints made
when the old sitting room was
abolished. Any assistance which
can be rendered in the present at
tempt to re-establish the institu
tion will certainly go towards ad
vancing a very desirable end.
