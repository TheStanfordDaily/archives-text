# FRESHMEN VICTORIOUS.
## Oakland High School Decisively Defeated on the Campus Oval Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
The Freshmen last Saturday de
feated Oakland High School in the
annual field-day held on the cam
pus. The Freshmen and Seniors
are the only classes now in college
which have won from Oakland. In
the spring of '98 Oakland had Cad
ogan and with him easily defeated
'01, and last spring '02 likewise suc
cumbed. The score, 73 to 35, shows
the superiority of the Freshmen.
Ligda, Oakland's best man, and
one who will in time develop into
a good all-round athlete, took the
100-yard dash, the first event, from
McCaughern, who ran at his shoul
der the whole distance. McCaugh
ern turned the tables in the 220
dash, winning from Ligda with a
yard to spare and finishing easily.
Lyons ran a plucky 220 and fin
ished close up. The quarter was
by far the prettiest race of the day.
Cheek of Oakland started out to
kill his field. Smith followed him
until the last turn and won handily
in a long sprint. Hawley hung
back until within twenty yards of
the tape and finished but a few
inches behind Cheek, who got
second. In the distances Oakland
was especially strong, Baker, with
third in the 880-yard run, being
the only Stanford man to get a
place in either the half or mile,
though the time for both events was
slow. Oakland had no entries in
the 120-yard hurdle, which went to
the Freshmen by default. Nara
more in the 220-hurdles displayed
poor judgment. In his race with
DeWitt he should have made it the
fastest heat in order that DeWitt,
and not Foster, of Oakland should
have qualified in the finals as sec
ond in the fastest heat.
In the field events the High
School athletes secured but a single
place, Cheek of Oakland easily win
ning the high jump. The ease
with which he cleared five feet four
inches showed how far he was
ahead of the nearest Stanford man,
Norman Dole.
