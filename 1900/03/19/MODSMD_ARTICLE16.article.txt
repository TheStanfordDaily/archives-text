In the defeat of our Junior
track team by the Ukiah High
School there is found much cause
for regret that it was impossible for
the class to send the best team of
which it was capable. While we
are well acquainted with the fact
that several of the best men were
left at home, outsiders do not so
readily understand that condition
of affairs and look at the score as
the only indication of Stanford
ability. That extraordinary efforts
should be put forth to make all
contests successful goes without
saying, but it is especially true of
those which take place on other
than the home grounds.
