## University of California Professor Delivers the Sunday Sermon. 
### 
Kendrick C. Babcock delivered
the sermon in the chapel Sunday
morning on the subject, "The Ob
solete Law of Reverence." In part
Professor Babcock said:
"Supposing that a miner should
decide to gather no gold but nug
gets and leave behind all the dust;
our currency would soon be de
pleted. Sometimes men stumble
upon nuggets, but this is not the
way the world's currency is kept
up. Sometimes people stumble
upon religion, but it is not by this
means that the ranks of God are
kept filled. It is the steady grind
and labor of those interested in
this high work that keep up the
reverence for the Father.
"What really appeals to a man
that he will reverence it? Does
home bring this up or does it pre
sent something for ridicule and
scoffing? Does womanhood call
for reverence or does it stand for
something that is to be jeered at
and cast under foot? We should
reverence the beauties of nature
which are spread out before us.
And as there is a call for reverence
in these low things, so much the
more in matters which are high.
"We are not in an age of rever
ence. Men give their lives for
hubbies, superiority in any worldly
thing, but pay no attention to the
higher and everlasting spiritual
affairs. Instead of reverence we
have a tendency to call things old.
The old Testament ceases to inspire
men. They say that commands
and teachings which were given to
those old people do not apply to
the affairs of today. We need a
revival, a renaissance. We need to
increase our capacity for reverence
and we can do this by taking ad
vantage of the best, and thus grow.
The capacity for reverence grows
as the capacity for music grows.
Some can remember when the
parlor organ, or the negro ditty ac
companied by a banjo, was his
highest ideal of music, but old
things have gone and new things
have come, and now a love for
the great masters fills you. Is
the reverence for the father or
mother the same now as it was ten
or twelve years ago? When you
were a child you realized that
your parents were your friends, but
as you grew older you realized your
debt to them was increasing, and
when you have children of your
own your reverence for father and
mother is complete.
"Americans are not a law-abid
ing people. They try to dodge the
customs and the minor ordinances
whenever it is convenient for them
to do so. How is this to be reme
died? Our conduct must be
guarded. Business life must not
crowd out higher motives. The
reverence which we have for the
lowest things and men can
not be substituted for the inner
most things of life, and above all
we must have a reverence for God."
