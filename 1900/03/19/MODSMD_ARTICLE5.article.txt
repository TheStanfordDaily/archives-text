# Debate Not Yet Settled.
## 
### 
Nothing has yet been received in
answer to the telegram sent to
Berkeley on Friday asking for an
interpretation of the question sub
mitted for the intercollegiate debate
as a substitute for the " Canteen "
question, and consequently no prog
ress has been made in determining
the side Stanford will support. A
telegram inquiring the cause of the
delav was sent late this afternoon.
