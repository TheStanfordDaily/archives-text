# Glee Club at San Mateo.
## 
### 
A fairly large and thoroughly
representative San Mateo audience
greeted the musical clubs in Li
brary Hall on Friday evening.
The program was well rendered
and well received. The clubs drove
to San Mateo in a big bus and had
dinner at the Hotel Mateo. After
the concert Miss Beatrice Brom
field, '01, tendered a reception to
the clubs at her home. She was
assisted in receiving by Miss Emily
Stevenson, '01, and Marion Fuller,
'98. The bus returned to the cam
pus about one o'clock a.m. About
$30 was realized above all expenses.
