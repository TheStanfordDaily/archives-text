# Woman's Sitting Room.
## 
### 
The sitting room which the Stu
dents' Guild has had fitted up for
the women of the University is now
ready for occupancy. The room
selected is in the southeast corner
of the basement of the new library
building, conveniently located near
the quad. It has been partially
furnished by subscriptions, and is
now comfortably fitted up with
chairs, tables, a couch, and a ham
mock. Arrangements are being
made to complete the furnishing of
the room after the Easter vaca
tion, when the Faculty Dramatic
Club is to give an entertainment to
raise funds for the purpose. The
room as it is now is a pleasant
place for lunching and resting.
