# Baseball Game Tomorrow.
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3 p.m.
sharp the Varsity will meet the St.
Mary's College team on the campus,
and a closely fought contest is ex
pected. St. Mary's has a good
team. It played Berkeley a brisk
game early in the season and since
then has improved. This is the
first time in six years that the Var
sity has crossed bats with St.
Mary's and the contest takes on
added interest on that account.
Considering the run of good play
that has struck our team, they
should add another victory to the
three already to their credit. The
line-up of the Varsity will be:
Lougheed,c.; Hampson and Lana
gan, p.; Edwards, s. s.; Havens, lb.;
Cowden, 2b.; Strohn, 3b.; Lowen
thal, 1. 112.; Murphy, c. 11 2.; Symonds,
r. 112.
