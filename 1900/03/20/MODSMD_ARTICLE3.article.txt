When interviewed by a J'alo
Alto representative this afternoon
in regard to baseball prospects,
Coach Murphy said: "The base
ball team has at last begun to
show signs of some improvement.
Yet there is room for a great deal
more. The batting and base-run
ning are very erratic, but the}' are
beginning to show a little improve
ment. Also the men are picking
up in team-work, which is the
great essential for baseball. On
the whole the outlook is more fav
orable, and we may look for better
work in future."
Dr. Murphy wishes to have the
men put more life in their playing,
in order to get as much as possible
out of the game. In his opinion
the men do not coach each other
enough. They should coach the
base runner more and in this way
help to increase the score.
