Through the investigations of
tint .Junior Farce management, it
has been found that a considerable
amount of stage scenery belonging
to the student body has been de
stroyed solely through lack of care.
This is by no means the first in
stance of the destruction or injury
of public; property here on account
of negligence. Of course one ex
cuse is found in the lack of storage
room, but this will probably be re
moved in the near future with the
building of the training house.
Even then, however, the losses will
continue unless there is a student
body officer created to act as a cus
todian of all student body property.
The expense of maintaining the
office would be paltry compared
with the saving involved, both of
money and inconvenience. Some
permanent provision is evidently
necessary and the sooner such an
office is created the greater will lie
the saving to the student body
treasury.
