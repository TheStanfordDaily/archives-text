# ST. MARY'S DEFEATED.
## Varsity Wins an Uninteresting Game on the Campus Diamond This Afternoon. 
### 
The game between the Varsity
and St. Mary's this afternoon was
a very poor exhibition of baseball
and ended in a score of 13 to 2 in
Stanford's favor. The umpire had
evidently never seen the game be
fore, and learned many things
about baseball before the end of
nine innings. But taking every
thing into consideration he was the
only redeeming feature with the
visiting team.
The Varsity put up a good game
and excepting a wild throw to third,
which let in the first of St. Mary's
runs, gave a good exhibition of the
game. Following is the score:
st. mary's.
