An attempt is being made by the
leading golf players of the Univer
sity of California and Stanford to
arrange for annual intercollegiate
golf contests. A representative
from the former is expected here
soon, when the matter will he more
definitely decided upon. While
there is no doubt ahout the advis
ability of an intercollegiate golf
tournament and its establishment
some time in the future, it is not
likely that arrangements can be
made for this year.
The Macrihanish Club, in which
all the local players are enrolled,
is not exclusively composed of stu
dents, it being one of its objects to
include all in the immediate vicin
ity of the University who are inter
ested in the sport. It would,
nevertheless, furnish practice links
for a university team and admira
ble ones for an intercollegiate con
test if that were to be held on home
grounds.
