Henry Ives Cobb has nearly com
pleted plans for most of the build
ings of the American University,
work upon which will begin in the
near future. The institution, lo
cated about four miles from the
Capitol at Washington, will be con
nected directly with that building
by the famous Massachusetts ave
nue, which will be extended for the
purpose. As planned now there
will be twenty-three massive build
ings of marble and granite located
on a well elevated campus of ninety
three acres. A splendid view of the
city, the river, and the Blue Ridge
range can be seen from any point
on the grounds. When completed
this will be one of the greatest
schoÂ®ls of the world.
