F. H. Yost is, us his picture shows, a man of much determination
and power. He is six feet tall, and weighs 195 pounds. He is a foot
ball man in every sense of the word. Loving the sport for itself, he
has devoted a large part of his time for the last seven years to master
ing the principles of the game in every detail.
The year that Lafayette won over Pennsylvania and played Prince
ton a tie, Yost was halfback on the Lafayette team. Strange as may
seem the coincidence, in that game he played against Kelley, the man
who will direct the football policy of the University of California the
coming year.
One year after graduating from college he took a team that had
never been heard of, and whipped into line a team that was cham
pions of (he State of Ohio, and played Michigan a tie game. The next
year he was called to the University of Nebraska. To best show his
work there, we print an extract from a letter written to Manager Gilder
sleeve by the manager of the Nebraska team :
"At the time he took charge of the team few of the old men had
returned to college, and in our school there has always been an indiffer
ence on the part of the football men to turn out for practice. Yost,
undaunted, took hold of the work at once, and with his characteristic
football spirit and enthusiasm soon had two teams on the field. As a
result of his thorough work Nebraska won the league championship,
defeating her old-time rival, Kansas, by the largest score ever made
against her by a Nebraska team.
"Coach Yost goes on the field in his football suit, and does not
merely tell the players how to play the individual positions, but shows
them just how it is played by playing the position himself. Every day
before the hour of practice begins he can be seen on the gridiron train
ing players, during their spare moments, in punting, goal and place
kicking, tackling, and the like. Several evenings in the week he has a
class for instruction in the rules and signal practice, and in critical mo
ments none of the men in Yost's team are at a loss what to do on ac
count of the lack of a thorough knowledge of the rules.
" He teaches only straightforward, legitimate football, and, in fact,
will tolerate no other kind. He is a perfect gentleman at all times,
both on and off the field, and was never known to say an unkind word
to any of the players, or utter a profane word."
The next year Kansas was struck with his ability, and determined
to get him. They offered him far more than Nebraska could afford to
pay him, and be signed with Kansas. Following is an extract from a
letter from the Kansas manager, dated February 2, 1900, concerning
his record there :
"... He came to us last year when our school was divided
in its support of the team, and the town was largely against us owing
to some trouble we bad over our formor coach, Dr. Woodruff of Penn
sylvania. Yost came here and went quietly at work, and by his quiet,
gentlemanly conduct he united all factions, and the varsity team never
before have had such support, both from the institution and the city.
As a result, from a team composed largely of new material he developed
a team which proved invincible.
" You asked what is his style of play, or what system. I might
say it it is Yost's system. He follows no single system. He is a great
football enthusiast, and when be reads an account of a game he works
out the plays and adapts the best points and style of play, making a
system of bis own."
Yost comes to us for $1200. This is much less than several offers
he has had elsewhere. Missouri, for example, offered him $1700, but he
preferred to coach one year on the Pacific Coast.
