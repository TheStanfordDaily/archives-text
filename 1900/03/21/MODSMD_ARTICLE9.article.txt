The proposition of arranging for
intercollegiate golf contests is one
which certainly deserves to be car
ried to a successful conclusion.
With other universities golf has
been an intercollegiate sport for
some years past and the time seems
ripe for its Addition to our annual
contests. That the game has come
to stay there can be no doubt, and
the favor it has already found
where tried on the same footing
with other intercollegiate sportt
certainly speaks for its success be
tween the two universities of tin
Pacific Coast. We hope the meet-!
ing of representatives will result in
plans for future contests if not for
this yeitr.
