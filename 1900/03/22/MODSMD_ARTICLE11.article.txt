The announcement which we
publish today.of the proposed ex
tension of the Stanford Law de
partment next year gives something
of an idea of the beginning of what
is soon destined to become the par
of the greatest law schools of the
United States. It is especially
pleasing to Stanford men to see
this development of what they have
always felt was an unduly neglected
department here. Instruction in
law is a paramount cause of the
attendance of men at the Univer
sity, and with them comes strength
in college spirit, athletics, and, in
fact, in all spheres that go to de
velop typical college life. Mourners
over the degeneracy of college spirit
here can well take hope as they see
our Law department becoming
what is demanded on the Pacific
Coast and what it undoubtedly
should be.
