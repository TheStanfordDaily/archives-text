# Collecting Tour in Japan.
## 
### 
S. J. Kuwana, an assistant in the
Entomology department, will spend
the summer in Japan collecting for
his department. He will pay
special attention to scale insects
with the object of determining what
scales now found in California were
imported from Japan and those
now found in Japan which are
liable in the future to be brought to
California. In addition to an in
vestigation of the different varieties
of scale a study will be made of the
parasites which destroy them. The
trip should be of great value to the
University, as Kuwana, being a
native of Japan, will be able to
make a very thorough investiga
tion. So far as known at present,
no one will accompany Kuwana,
but the department may decide
later to send some one to assist in
the collection.
