The program which Mrs. Ruie I).
Meeke is to give tomorrow night in
the chapel will be an enjoyable
one, judging from the notices which
have been given of her work else
where. Mrs Meeke has a clear,
musical voice, which is heard to ad
vantage in her imitation of bird
calls. Her program tomorrow night
will include selections from Riley,
Stewart, and other popular writers.
The entertainment will be given in
the chapel, and will be under the
management of the Junior Class.
The admission will be twenty-five
cents.
