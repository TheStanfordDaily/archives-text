# NEW COURSES IN LAW.
## Subjects in Which Instruction Will Next Year be Offered for the First Time. 
### 
Next year will murk the real be
ginning of Stanford University's
new Law department. The return
of Dr. Nathan Abbott, and the ad
dition of I)r. Hall of Cornell and
Harvard to the Law faculty will
increase the number of its regular
members to five. Besides these
there will be two non-resident
lecturers and two courses given by
professors of other departments,
making the total courses offered in
law about twenty-five in number.
A circular will be issued by the de
partment, after the publication of
the University catalog, giving full
information concerning it.
Probably the most interesting
new course will be that in "Ele
mentary Law." This will be given
three times a week and will be par
ticipated in by all members of the
law faculty, each lecturing upon
the subject in which he is best
qualified. It is intended both for
those beginning the study of law
and for those who wish a general
knowledge of the elemer tary points
of that subject. The mode of giv
ing the lectures is an entirely new
idea, and the course, drawing in
struction from men specialized in
each subject, should certainly pro
duce the best results possible to be
derived.
Dr. Abbott will give two courses
in "Property," the first and third
years, each being of three hours.
Besides these he will give a two
hour course on "Persons."
Professor Whittier will continue
the courses he has been giving this
year. "Pleadings" will not be
given next year but will be taken
up the year following in connection
with "Equity."
Instructor Lewers, in addition to
the classes which he now has, will
give a three-hour course in "Car
riers" and "Damage," the former
subject occupying somewhat more
than half the year.
Instructor Reynolds will add a
two-hour course in "Equity" to
to those which he is giving at
present.
Dr. Hall is unknown to Stanford
students but is a graduate of Cor
nell and of Harvard Law School,
and comes here with an unsur
passed reputation as a student and
teacher of law. He will give three
three-hour courses, "Constitutional
Law," formerly given by Professor
Spencer of the History department,
"Bills and Notes," and "Sales."
Besides these, Hon. Curtis H.
Lindley, of the San Francisco bar,
will resume his course of one lec
ture a week on "Mines and Irriga
tion." Joseph Hutchinson, also a
San Francisco attorney, will con
tinue his course on "California
Practice," of one lecture each
week.
In the work of other departments,
Professor Fairclough's course on
"Roman Law" will be open to Law
students and will count in their de
partment as well as in Latin. In
a similar standing will be the work
in "International Law" under Pro
fessor Duniway of the History de
partment.
