# CHANGES IN COURSES.
## History and Economics Departments Announce Alterations for Next Year. 
### 
The Stanford University cata
logue, proof of which is expected at
the Registrar's office by the end of
next week, and which will be issued
about the middle of April, will give
full information about a number of
new courses of instruction which
will be offered by the different de
partments. We print, as far as is
now definitely known, the changes
anticipated by the History and
Economics departments, and will
add information concerning others
as it is decided upon.
The History department will of
fer several new courses of instruc
tion next year, all those now being
given by Professor Show being
dropped for the year on account of
his absence in Europe. The most
important will be that in "Inter
national Law," by Professor Duni
vvay. This will be a three-hour
course for two semesters. The case
book system will be used for the
most part, but not to the entire ex
clusion of the text-book. The course
will embody a statement of the
principles of international law de
duced from the leading cases, a his
tory of its doctrines, and a history
of diplomacy and treatise. Pro
fessor Duniway will also give the
course in "American Colonial His
tory," which has been under Dr.
Howard this year.
Dr. Howard will give his two
hour course on " The French Revo
lution," which comes every alter
nate year, and will omit History
10, " English Constitution Since
Henry VII."
Miss Anderson will give a new
courseon " Roman History" in ad
dition toher present " Grecian His
tory." This is intended to take the
place of Professor Show's work on
thesamesubject during his absence,
but will be continued permanently,
so that two courses will be open to
freshman students in Roman his
tory.
Miss Evans will add a course
connected with the history of the
western United States to those
which she has given this year.
The Economics department will
be strengthened next year by the
addition of Hurt Estes Howard, who
comes to accept an instructorship
in that department, with political
science as his specialty. He will
have charge of two new courses, one
in "American Politics" and one in
"Government," each a two-hour
course, the former open to all and
the latter to all but first-year stu
dents. Dr. Howard is a clergyman
and for the past few years has been
pastor of a church in Los Angeles,
where he has attracted much atten
tion as a preacher. He is at present
studying at Harvard.
Another new course, of which Dr.
Ross will have charge, will be a
second semester course in "Elemen
tary Economics." This course is
intended as an experiment and if
successful will be continued. Many
students of other branches do not
feel that they can give a whole
year's time to economic study, and
the department has planned this
course to accommodate them.

The seminary will take up the
subjects of ''Colonies" and "Colon
ization," inasmuch as they present
problems which are now attracting
public attention to a great degree.
New books dealing with these sub
jects are being ordered for the
library as a basis for the work. The
work of the department will be gen
erally redistributed to provide for
the courses of which Dr. Fetter has
had charge, as he and Dr. Durand
will both be absent from the Uni
versity next year.
