It is greatly to be hoped that
the Berkeley debaters will learn
from the negotiations which have
passed between the Berkeley and
Stanford committees the past few
weeks Stanford's attitude toward
indefinite and ambiguous questions.
To be exact, we desire to discuss
only unequivocal and clearly stated
isMies. Anything else appears to
us as being unworthy of an inter
collegiate debate between two such
institutions as Stanford and Berk
eley. To prevent a deadlock and
because of certain complications,
our debaters this year finally ac
cepted the ambiguous question sub
mitted by Berkeley, but in doing so
they conceded far more than Berk
eley had any right to ask. We
hope that the magnanimity on the
part of Stanford, both in this last
matter and that of the place for
holding the debate, will be recog
nized when future difficulties arise
between the two intercollegiate com
mittees.
