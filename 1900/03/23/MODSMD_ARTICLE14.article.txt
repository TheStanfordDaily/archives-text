# Golf Links Improved.
## 
### 
The last week has seen the usual
improvements finished on the links
of the Macrihanish Golf Club
which are necessary at this time of
the year. The grass has been cut
over the whole course, but the
stubble, while as short as possible,
is still too heavy to make the links
at their best. This is especially
noticeable in the first three holes.
The greens have been scraped and
are all in good condition. No ad
ditional bunkers have been added
beyond the one which was placed
between the fifth and six holes last
fall.
