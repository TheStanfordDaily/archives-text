# Contributions Asked.

### 
Contributions of winter clothing,
food, or money are asked for exiled
Russian Quakers now in Canada.
A carload of contributions leaves
San Jose next week, and anything
given here can be sent on Monday
to Professor Cox, room 15 quad.
The Quakers have been exiled on
account of refusing to bear arms,
and the object of the subscription is
to provide necessities for them until
they are able to support themselves
in this country.
