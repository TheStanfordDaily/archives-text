# Incendiary Fire.
## 
### 
The tire which was discovered in
Architect Hodges office last night
about half-past eight and reported
in yesterday's Palo Alto was un
doubtedly of incendiary origin.
Cotton batting was wrapped around
the stanchions on the northwest
corner and soaked with coal oil.
The wind had been blowing from
that direction all yesterday after
noon. From these facts and the
fact that the water had been turned
off part of the afternoon, the fire
must have been set by someone
maliciously inclined. When seen
this afternoon Architect Hodges
said: "I have no idea as to who
would attempt such a thing. I
have discharged no one and can
think of nobody to suspect. All
the most valuable papers are kept
in the fireproof vault near the Inn.
Of course 1 cannot carry every
thing down each evening, and
while it would merely be a great
deal of bother to replace some
things, there are others it would be
impossible to duplicate."
