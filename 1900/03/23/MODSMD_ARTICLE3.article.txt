# Two Track Contests.
## 
### 
Arrangements have been com
pleted for the Stanford Freshmen
vs. University of Nevada field-day,
which will be held at Reno on Sat
urday, April 7th. The events will
be the same as in the intercollegiate
meet, with the exception that the
walk will be omitted. Though the
Nevada men wanted the substitu
tion of a bicycle race for the walk, it
has been agreed to omit both. The
team of eleven men will be chosen
after the interclass meet on Junior
Day. They will leave the Univer
sity Friday morning, April 6th.
The interclass meet will be held
on the campus oval at 9:30 on the
morning of Junior Day, a week
from today. An annual cup will
be awarded the winning class, but
it is generally conceded that this
trophy lies between the Juniors and
Freshmen this year, while the
Seniors and Sophomores will fight
it out to see who will not have to
take the leather medal. The list of
entries will be published next week.
The contract for the grandstands
will be awarded by Monday,so that
enough of them will be completed
for Friday. As an admission of
only twenty-five cents will be
charged, theexoiting meet promised,
together with class rivalry, will un
doubtedly bring out a big crowd.
