# COLLEGIATE ALUMNAE.
## Annual Reception Tomorrow to the Women Seniors of Berkeley and Stanford. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon in San
Francisco the California Branch of
the Association of Collegiate Alum
nae will give its annual reception
to the women seniors of the Uni
versity of California and Stanford
University. This association is
composed of women who have re
ceived degrees in art, philosophy,
science, or literature, from the uni
versities which are admitted to
membership in the association,
these including Cornell, Vassar,
Wellesley, Radcliffe, Oberlin,
the two California universities and
a few others.
The object of the association is
to unite the alumnae of different
institutions for practical educa
tional work. During the last few
years the association of San Fran
cisco has accomplished a great deal
along this line. Largely through
its efforts Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst
was appointed a member of the
Hoard of Regents of the University
of California; and it was also
through its efforts that a woman has
lately been appointed on the
school board of San Francisco.
It was the women of this associa
tion who were instrumental in the
establishing of gymnasium work
for the women at Herkeley. They
also last year made a sanitary in
spection of the schools of the towns
around the bay. The association
numbers among its members some
of the most prominent women of
California, among others Dr. Ade
laide D. Brown, Mrs. Warren
Cheney, Miss Sarah Hamlin, Mrs.
Mary Roberts Smith, Miss Anna
Head, Miss Lillie J. Martin, Miss
Millicent Shinn, and Mrs. Bernard
Moses.
In former years Stanford has
not been well represented at these
annual meetings to the women
seniors, and it is urged that they
attend tomorrow. Aside from the
educational benefit accruing from
membership in the association,
there is the distinct social pleasure
of meeting some of the most promi
nent women in California.
