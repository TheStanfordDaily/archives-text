# RAGGED BASEBALL.
## Both Stanford Varsity and Berkeley Gave Poor Exhibitions Saturday. 
### 
The Varsity went up against the
Firemen last Saturday for another
defeat, the insurance men winning
out by a score of 8-5. Both teams
played ragged ball and managed
to pile up eleven errors between
them. The scoring on both sides
came about through errors and
loose playing.
The Varsity meets Berkeley on
April 7th on the California campus,
and unless it takes a brace the first
game of tne intercollegiate series
will come hard. The score:
fireman's fund.
