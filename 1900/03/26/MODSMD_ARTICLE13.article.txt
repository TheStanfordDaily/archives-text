The slight attendance at Fri
day evening's Quad recital empha
sizes the complaint frequently made
that the promoters of such enter
tainments are not as careful as they
should be in selecting what they
shall present. If a benefit enter
tainment is worth giving at all it
is worth selecting with care, both
for those to be benefitted and for
the whole University. College com
munities are certainly not too care
ful of their criticism, and, with this
knowledge, there is slight excuse
for giving them an invitation to
criticize. There is as great an op
portunity for judgment in selecting
what an entertainment shall he as
in carrying it out after the selec
tion is made, and greater care in
both respects might profitably be
exercised in numerous cases where
professional talent is brought to the
University.
