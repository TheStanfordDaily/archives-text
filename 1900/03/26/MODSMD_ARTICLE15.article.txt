# Seminary Room-Warming.
## 
### 
The Historical seminary and
its alumni held a special meeting
in their room in the new library
building Friday evening. It was
more in the nature of a room
warming than a formal meeting,
though a special syllabus was pre
pared for the occasion. Professor
Show read an original poem of
dedication, and a greeting to the
seminary from Professor Spencer
in the way of a description of his
work in the German seminaries
was read.
