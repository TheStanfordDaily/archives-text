# Concert at Redwood City.
## 
### 
The musical clubs piled into the
big buses Saturday afternoon and
drove to Redwood City where they
sang and played their concert
through at the Alhambra theatre
the same evening, earning for their
time and trouble something like
ten cents apiece, about $3.00 being
realized above expenses. It was
the first frost of the season, the
houses so far having been, both in
the valley and in distant places,
of uniformly good size. The
leader of the Glee invited the few
scattered patrons of the Redwood
concert up to the front row, and a
very home-like and social evening
was enjoyed by all.
The concert was under the aus
pices of the Native Daughters and,
moreover, was for the benefit of the
"Town Park Fund." If the size of
the audience is any indication of
Redwood's state and municipal
pride and interest in the great Uni
versity at its doors, all three must
be in a truly alarming condition.
But the town's appreciation of art
cannot be questioned, as a small
cake-walking minstrel troupe last
week filled the local theatre to the
doors.
