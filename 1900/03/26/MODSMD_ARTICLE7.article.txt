## Rev. B. Fay Mills Describes the Religion of the Twentieth Century. 
### 
The regular Sunday sermon was
delivered in the chapel by Rev.
B. Fay Mills of the Oakland
Unitarian church. He chose as a
subject, "The Religion of the
Twentieth Century," and said:
"In the strictest sense there is
only one religion as there is only
one ocean; but as the ocean flows
in different divisions, so religion is
separated into different branches.
Every age keeps all that the previ
ous age has learned and adds some
thing more; this is true of religion
as well as of other thirgs.
"By religion we may mean sev
eral kinds of things. For instance
we may speak of doctrinal religion
or the philosophy of religion, but
I desire to speak rather of that
phase of religion known as char
acter. There are three divisions of
the twentieth century religion:
First, it will be a religion of
learners. Our western idea of re
ligion has been that God has
'handed down, by his prophets, a
set formula of belief. We are be
ginning to see now that religion is
not necessarily a revelation, but
rather the indication of man's
ability to understand God.
"This is the age of discovery.
Professor Alfred Wallace points
out that there have been twenty
great discoveries in the thirty
thousand years of the world's his
tory. Of these thirteen have been
made in the last century. It seems
incredible that at one time man
could not comprehend that two
and two made four, or that music
is anything different from noise.
"Slowly but surely we are per
fecting a spiritual philosophy that
will elevate mankind, a philosophy
that ought to banish disease and
death. 1 do not think it impossi
ble that the world of force is about
to be revealed. We speak of the
veil between us and God. There
is no veil; it is only our own im
perfections that make a veil exist.
Only yesterday a man would have
been branded as a fool if he had
said,' You can look through my
hand.' But you can. For the
first time in the world's history we
know that we know and the great
est thing that we know is that we
may know more.
"In the second place, it will be a
religion of laborers. Many re
ligious teachers have taught that
labor is degrading. The Hindoos
and Christians alike have said that
the world is to be shunned, and
that it is a thing separate from the
soul. We are beginning to see that
the call to men is a call to labor.
Religious labor is the labor of a man
who has had a pattern shown him
from a mountain-top, and says, ' 1
must conform the world to this.'
Let us understand that every man
must do nil his work to the glory of
God. If he be a shoemaker, let him
be a shoemaker by the grace of
God. I believe in a religion of lov
ers. The lover is a man who be
lieves in the divine unity, and the
man who believes in a war between
a good and an evil spirit is not a
lover. We have painted our ideas

of the universe 011 too small a can
vas. We speak of seventy years,
and then eternity. It is all eter
nity.
" We once heard of the church as
an ark in which we could go to
heaven, and that Christ came to
save a few from the wreck of a
wicked world. We might rather
say that Christ came to save the
wreck. The world is not an old
rotten apple ; it is simply a good,
sound apple, not yet ripe. There
are no unsolved problems. All the
misery would be lifted out of this
world of ours if we could live in a
spirit of kindness.
" I believe that the gospel of men
should be to trust what Jesus said,
what Buddha and Zoroaster said ;
nay, more, what your own heart
says."
