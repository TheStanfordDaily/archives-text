The selection of the officials for
its Annual by the Sophomore Class
this afternoon fairly starts that or
ganization upon its upper-class ex
istence, and at the same time brings
to it the responsibilities of that
position. The class has already
shown in the management of its
finances a care to avoid difficulties
along that line which, if continued,
will save them much trouble in the
future. We wish them success from
the beginning in the production of
an Annual which will voice both
the ability of the class and of the
whole University.
