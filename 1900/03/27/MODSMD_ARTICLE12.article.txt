# New Bleachers.
## 
### 
A beginning was made this after
noon on the permanent bleachers
to be erected by the finish line of
the oval and across from the old
bleachers on the diamond, and they
will be three tiers high and fourteen
inches between each seat. The con
tract has been let to E. A. Hettinger
of Palo Alto, who hopes to have
fifty feet of the bleachers by the
oval done so they can be used on
Junior Day. More, of course, will
be required for the field-day, but
they will be constructed later.
When the permanent athletic field
is decided upon the bleachers will
be moved there Those that are
to be erected now will seat 1200
people.
