# Volunteers' Memorial.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee held yesterday after
noon the committee in charge of
the memorial plate for the Stan
ford volunteers of the late war sub
mitted plans and estimates. It was
suggested that the money for
such a plate could be satisfactorily
raised by popular subscription,
or by selling souvenir engravings or
miniatures of the tablet. The mat
ter was postponed until Thursday at
1:30, when it will be discussed at a
special meeting.
The committee appropriated ten
dollars for the girls' musical clubs.
