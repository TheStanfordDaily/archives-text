Arrangements for Senior Week
for next May have, been progress
! ing since the appointment of the
various committees early in the
semester. The seven days' pro
gram is now practically decided
upon, though full details are by
110 means complete. Each affair
is under the direct supervision of a
particular committee, and these
will not be able to make complete
reports until after the Easter va
cation.
On Thursday evening, May :44th,
the last day of instruction, there
will probably be a concert by the
glee and mandolin clubs in the
assembly hall. The custom was
inaugurated last year of these fare
well concerts and that one proved
such a success that tbev will prob
ably hereafter be a regular feature
of Commencement Week.
The Senior Farce will be given
in the assembly hall either Friday
or Saturday evening and the recep
tion by the Senior Class to the stu
dents of the University will take
place in Encina on the alternate
evening. The character of the
farce has not yet been determined
upon.
Saturday morning the annual
Faculty vs. Senior baseball game
will be played on the campus.
This is always an interesting affair
though it is conceded the seniors
should come out ahead this year.
Sunday morning the baccalaur
eate sermon will be delivered in
the chapel and that afternoon the
ivy will be planted at the new
chapel for the first time. The
minister for the sermon has not
yet been selected.
Monday evening the Senior Hall
will b& given in Encina Club Room,
and the next evening, Tuesday,
the Promenade will he held on the
quad. For both of these special
arrangements are to be made in the
way of decorations and they are
sure to prove the attractions that
they have been in past years.
The last day of the week is Com
mencement Day, Wednesday,
May 30th, the exercises which will
be held in the assembly hall.
The plans of the seniors include
either an entertainment or a farce
to be given for the benefit of the
class soon after the Easter recess.
If it is decided that there is suffi
cient time, the latter will be given,
probably by Sword and Sandals.
