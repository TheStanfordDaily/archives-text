# FURTHER CHANGES PLANNED.
## Language Departments Offer New Lines of Work for Next Year. 
### 
A few changes in the courses
offered by the departments of
English, Classical Languages,"and
Romanic Languages have been
planned for the next year, a sum
mary of which is here given.
"The History of English Litera
ture" will extend only through the
seventeenth century. The eigh
teenth and nineteenth centuries
will, during 1900-01, be taken up
more in detail in courses 18, 19, 24,
and 25. The course will be given
by Professors Anderson and Fliigel,
the period formerly taken up by
Professors Hudson, Lathrop, and
Newcomer being eliminated.
Professor Anderson will give the
course on the "Characteristics of
Shakspere," two hours during the
second semester, a course which he
intended to give this year, but
which his absence interfered with.
Professor Anderson's course,
"Wordsworth and his Contempor
aries" will drop consideration of
"Coleridge and Keats" and will be
given on "Wordsworth, Shelley,
and Byron." It will be changed
from a three-hour to a two-hour
course during the first semester.
His "Browning and Tennyson,"
course 25, will be changed to
"Browning." A single poem, "The
Ring and the Book," will be con
sidered. The course has been re
duced to a two-hour course during
the second semester. His "Milton"
becomes a three-hour course the
first semester instead of both se
mesters. Only three of Milton's
poems will be taken up, "Paradise
Lost," "Paradise Regained," and
"Sampson Agonistes." The course in
"Shakspere," Professor Anderson's
specialty, is to be reduced from a
two-semester to a one-semester
course, three hours a week, and
will include eight of Shakspere's
plays. Different plays will be con
sidered each year and credit will be
allowed for one, two, or more se
mesters, according to the amount
of time the student cares to give
to the work.
Of the graduate courses, 28, "His
tory of English Lyrical Poetry,"
29, "History of Middle English
Literature, and 32 h, "Beginnings of
Modern English Literature, the
Prose from Mallory toTindale," all
given by Professor Fliigel, will be
omitted next year. Course 32 a,
taking up the poetry of early Tudor
times, will be given.
Professor Lathrop will add to the
courses which he gives at present
a new one of two hours on "The
History of the English Novel from
De Foe to Thackeray."
Professor Newcomer will have a
new first semester course of two
hours in "Modern English Pros
ody." His "Advanced English
Composition" will be continued a
two semester course.
Miss Pearson will give a new
course, "The Development of Eng
lish Prose," on the formal and ar
tistic. side from the beginning of
the sixteenth century. It will be
an advanced course of two hours,
to enter which students must ob
tain the instructor's permission.

A new addition, which will be
of particular interest, will be a
teachers' course of two hours by
Professor Lathrop and Instructor
Pearson on "The Teaching of Eng
lish Literature and Composition in
Schools." This will be for ad
vanced students.
In all probability these plans
will compel Professor Lathrop to
hand over to others his work in
English 8, Professor Newcomer his
in English 5, and Instructor Pear
son that which she has in Eng
lish 8.
The plans of the department of
Classical Languages do not em
brace any radical changes. So far
as is known, the corps of instruc
tors will remain the same as this
year, but the courses will differ in
a few respects.
In Latin, Professor Pease is to
have a class in "Roman Institu
tions." The seminary will be con
ducted by Professors Pease and
Fairclough, the work to center
about Latin comedy. In addition
to the regular first-year work, there
will be an extra course in "Lyric
Poetry," under Instructor Elmore.
In Greek, Professors Fairclough
and Lovejoy are to conduct jointly
a class in ethics, credit for which
will be given in either the Greek
or Philosophy departments. Simi
lar recognition will be given in two
departments to Professor Fair
clough's series of lectures on Rom
an law.
In the department of Romanic
Languages two important changes
are anticipated, one of them deal
ing with French, the other with
Italian.
Heretofore the standard elemen
tary course in French has been one
of five hours. Comparison of the
resulting work with the work ac
complished in the three-hour sec
tion indicates that the ground cov
ered is substantially the same, with
economy of time in the hitter's
favor. Beginning with next semes
ter, therefore, the first year work in
French will be carried on only in
three-hour sections.
In Italian there will be two
courses next year instead of one.
In addition to the class in the'ele
ments of the language, there will
be an advanced course of two hours,
conducted by Professor Matzke.
The reading basis will be Dante's
La Divina Commedia.
Course 3, " Rapid Reading and
Conversation," will be given under
Professors Davidson and Frein.
Professor Frein will also have
charge of course 5, " History of
French Literature."
