# JAPAN AND JAPANESE.
## George W. Dickie Lectures on The Kingdom of the Mikado. 
### 
George W. Dickie, general man
ager of the Union Iron Works,
spoke in the chapel last night on
"The Commerce and Industry of
Japan," relating his experiences
and impressions during a recent
trip to the island.
He said that the Japanese were
now of special interest commercially
on account of their becoming one of
our best customers on the other side
of the Pacific. The accumulated
experiences of years of the civilized
world are being rapidly picked up
and made use of by the Japanese.
Their mercantile fleet has devel
oped remarkably of late years, until
now they are the fifth ship-owning
nation of the world, and one of the
great factors in the commerce of the
Pacific, So many of their people
are now engaged in the fishing in
dustry that they will never want
for sailors to man their boats, and
the government has encouraged
shipping by a wise system of boun
ties, so that it is constantly growing
and stretching over the world.
The people have shown great
constructive ability, both in their
ancient and modern engineering
works. Their roads are well made
and kept ; their lighthouses, har
bors, and fortifications are of the
front rank ; their railroads are first
class, and the mileage fares are
about one-half those of this country.
The Japanese are masters in the
art of metal working. The gigan
tic image of Buddah at Kamapura,
cast during the middle ages, is a
masterpiece of bronze work.
Personally the people of Japan
are cleanly and kindly, without
high ideals or strict morals, and
with no love for the truth for its
own sake. Their commercial pro
ceedings are characterized by very
unbusinesslike habits. In this con
nection Mr. Dickie discussed the
subject of Japanese manufacturers
competing with our own. Their
expert craftsmen working for small
w;iges enable them to produce goods
very cheaply, and pay large divi
dends on their investments, but the
speaker pointed out that with the
increased industrial adjustment of
the country the return on invest
ments is falling to the level of prof
its elsewhere. He also called at
tention to the fact that with the
development of wealth in Japan,
their people would develop new
wants of their own to consume their
productions, so that foreign coun
tries need have but little fear of
the competition of Japanese goods.
The speaker closed with a de
scription of the Royal Cherry-
Bloom Party, which he attended.
His story of his search for a Prince
Albert coat and a plug hat, which
were a prerequisite to admission to
the Emperor's party, was an amus
ing commentary on the curious cus
toms of the land.
