# New Scenery in Place.
## 
### 
The Juniors were busy today
putting up the new scenery in the
assembly hall. It is satisfactory
in every way. The curtain is ar
rnnged ;is for tableaux, being dm wn

;to each side instead of rolling. It
|is burlap, fleur-de-lis figures in
green over the body and conven
tional red and brown characters as
a border.
The new quad scene is better
than the old one, showing two
arches and several pillars. The
position of the audience is in the
quad, and looking on the stage
through the corridor to the class
room, the background being the
sandstone wall and raftered roof.
Another scene is the interior of a
room. At the sides are fluted col
umns with Corinthian capitals,
uniting with wainscoted walls,
with the necessary doors, windows,
and fireplaces. The scenery is new
and well painted and will be an
attractive feature of the farce.
These two scenes and the curtain,
wings, and overhead flies com
plete the scenery. The whole cost
about one hundred and sixty-five
dollars.
