# Junior Prom Arrangements.
## 
### 
The Junior Prom will start
promptly at 8:30 Friday night,
and the lights will be on until 2
a.m. From the sale of tickets the
large attendance anticipated has
become a certainty, and if the num
ber of couples justifies the innova
tion, dancing will be done in the
lobby as well as in the Encina club
room.
The decorations will be simple
red and white, the class colors pre
dominating. About the middle of
the evening the supper extra will
be called, and after waltzing to
seats about the big hall refresh
ments will be served. The man
agement offer as the feature of the
evening fine music and a good
floor.
