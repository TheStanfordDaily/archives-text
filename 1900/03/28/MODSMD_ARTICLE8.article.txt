Friday afternoon we see our
baseball team in its last practice
game before the first of the inter
collegiate series. That there will
be a large attendance to show them
our confidence in their ability goes
without saying. The extra bleach
ers should be unable to accommo
date all who attend. The men have
putin a season of uninterrupted
practice, and every student owes
them a farewell acknowledgement
when this last opportunity is given
us.
