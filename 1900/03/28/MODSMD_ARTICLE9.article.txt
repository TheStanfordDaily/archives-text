The determination of the Quad
management to omit fraternity pic
tures from their publication this
year will, we believe, detract con
siderably from its value and ar
tistic qualities. While precedent
amongst other universities goes far
towards justification of such ii step,
it does not completely warrant do
ing 11 way with one of the principal
features of former Annuals. Lie
productions characteristic of the
University are the life of such a
publication, and their replacement
by mere copyrighted plates, as is to
be done in this instance, will de
tract that much from the repre
sentativeness of the book. It is
scarcely possible to overdo the
number of local pictures which
might be reproduced with profit in
a publication issued but once a
year. We hope the policy adopted
in this year's Quad will not be a
continued one.
