The University authorities have
made a serious mistake in their al
teration of the site for the new post
oflice, especially as a matter of con
venience, which is the principal
object to he consulted in the situa
tion of that building. The corner
formerly selected was none too close
to the center of University life, but
was much better suited than the
place where construction was begun
this morning. Encina and Roble
are designed to be maintained as
the most advantageous places of
student residence, and very prop
erly so from a student as well as a
business standpoint. In the face
of this object, we can hardly see
why the postoffice, the most neces
sary and frequently visited building
of the University,should be placed
away from the other buildings in a
row of private houses. It is a varia
tion from the concentrated plan of
buildings adopted by the quad
rangle system, which, we believe,
should not be made. We hope the
matter has not gone too far to yield
to the public sentiment, which is
certain to ask for the selection of a
site closer to the center of student
life.
