With tiie opening of college
iifter next week's vacation, the
Daily Palo Alto intends to appear
in six-page form. This will mean
increased opportunities on our staff,
though there is always a chance for
students interested in newspaper
work to obtain the training which
daily drill will give them. It is
not too late this semester for new
men to get places on the staff, and
thereby obtain precedence in pro
motion over those who will begin
next fall. We hope that any in
tending to take np the work during

their college career will respond to
the announcement made in another
column.
