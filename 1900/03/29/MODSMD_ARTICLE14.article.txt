The Sophomoke Class deserve
more than a mere passing criticism
for the bad management of their
affairs, which has necessitated the
holding of two elections for their
Quad officers. The transaction of
such business is too important an
affair to justify the class in once
taking a step which they now find
out was clearly illegal. The omis
sion to see that fact when it oc
curred seems entirely inexcusable,
as the slightest acquaintance with
the class constitution t-hould pre
vent anything but legal action at
an election. The bad results of
the Sophomores' carelessness should
again show the necessity for ex
treme care in the management of
student elections.
