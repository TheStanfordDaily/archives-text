At the meeting of the V. W.C.A.

gave an interesting talk on the life
and work of Frances E. Willard.
Mrs. Congdon was associated for
some time with Mrs. Willard in
W. C. T. U. work, and during the
latter's tour of California acted as
her private secretary. Mrs. Cong
don has settled in Palo Alto, and
will devote a good deal of attention
to the Christian work of the Uni
versity.
