# Postoffice Site Changed.
## 
### 
The new postofiice building, an
account of which wan given in
Tuesday's Daily Palo Alto, was
begun this morning. The site, how
ever, has been changed. It was
proposed to place the building on
t he southwest corner of Lasuen and
Portola avenues but, as a result of
a visit by Mrs. Stanford yesterday,
construction was begun on the lot
on Lasuen avenue opposite the
/eta Psi house, much to the sur
prise of every one.
The building when completed
will cost about $0,500, instead of
$5,600 as formerly announced, and
will include the resident architect's
oflice in the southeast corner and a
telephone and telegraph oflice on

the northeast. Full length columns
will run the whole length of the
front and the roof will be tiled sim
ilar to that of the quadrangle build
ings.
Considerable dissatisfaction is
expressed at the new site, as it will
not be even as convenient a lo
cation as is the present postoflice.
It was changed on account of the
danger of fire from the Camp,
which was feared at the situation
first determined upon. There is
talk of the circulation of a petition
for a more convenient location, but
sentiment has not as yet taken any
definite action.
