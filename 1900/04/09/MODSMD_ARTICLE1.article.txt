# STANFORD LOSES.
## Varsity Puts Up a Poor Game on the Berkeley Campus. 
### 
The Varsity lost the first of the
series of three intercollegiate base
ball games last Saturday on the
Berkeley campus by a score of 10
to 8. The comparative size of the
error lists tell a good part of the
story, the Varsity outfield being re
sponsible in three muffed flies for
enough runs to have saved the day
with a good margin. Captain
Strohn and Catcher Lougheed
played our best game, the former
especially holding the men steady
at critical moments. Aside from
these none deserved favorable men
tion.
There was a large crowd of Stan
ford rooters present, who outdid
the supporters of Blue and Gold
in their encouragement of their
team.
