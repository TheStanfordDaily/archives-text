# FRESHMEN WIN OUT.
## Nevada Track Team Defeated in Their Own Weather by Four Points. 
### 
Amid an intermittent snowstorm,
accompanied by high winds, the
Freshman track team last Satur
day defeated the University of Ne
vada athletes at Reno by a score of
54 to 50. The track was soft, and
the conditions generally were unfa
vorable, except in the sprints. The
short runs were held over a straight
away course, with the wind at the
back of the runners. This accounts
for the fast time in the 100 and
440 yard dashes.
Both McCaughern and Lyons
outclassed the Nevada men ill the
sprints. Smith won the quarter
with ten yards to spare. Hawley
was ill from the effects of the trip
up, and did not run up to form.
Pollard had the high hurdles well
in hand until he fell a short dis
tance from the tape, and was dis
qualified. The unusual altitude and
high wind so seriously interfered
with Nikirk that he was unable to
score a place in the mile. The
Freshmen had no entries in the
half.
The Freshman team was com
posed of: Naramore (captain), Pol
lard, E. A. Smith, Hawley, Lyons,
Brooke, McCaughern,Parker, Beach,
Dole, and Nikirk.
The Nevada team, which has
been coached by John Brunton,
ex-'99, was: Moorman (captain),
McCarran, Brule, F. Smith, B.
Smith, C. C. Smith, Jamison, Rob
erts, Mack, Jones, Stubbs, Richards,
Kornmayer,Springtneyer, Packard,
Ward, Tobin, and Case.
Manager Cant well, who accom
panied the team, is well satisfied
with the showing they made. He
said: " The weather was very un
favorable. The high altitude af
fected Nikirk, while the winds pre
vented Dole,Brooke,and the men in
the weights from doing their best.
The sprints were the only events
favored by the wind. Considering
the weather, the men did exceed
ingly well."
