### 
President Jordan today returned
from his eastern trip, which he
commenced over a month ago. He
stopped first at Chicago, where he
attended the meeting of the repre
sentatives of the universities of
America to found the Association
of American Universities. Four
teen of thehiggest universities form
the initial membership. The asso
ciation is to he composed of insti
tutions on the North American
Continent engaged in giving ad
vanced or graduate instruction" for
the purpose of considering matters
of common interest relating to
graduate study.

After leaving Chicago President
Jordan followed the itinerary which
was published in the Daily Palo
Alto, with the exception of the
Washington lecture, which was
omitted.
Aside from the meeting at Chi
cago, President Jordan's object was
to get in touch with other institu
tions of learning throughout the
country, and see for himself the
conditions prevailing at eastern
colleges.
While en route Dr. Jordan deliv
ered over thirty addresses, most of
them on educational subjects,
speaking for the most part to au
diences of teachers and educators.
Speaking of the Logansport inci
dent, President Jordan roundly
criticised present-day journalism
and its methods. He said : " While
at Logansport I was engaged in
conversation with Governor Roose
velt of New York and a few other
men. Some reporter quoted me as
saying that Lioosevelt said Presi
dent McKinley had no more back
bone than a chocolate caramel. I
at once telegraphed to President
McKinley that it was false, and
Mr. Roosevelt did the same. The
story was absolutely false. Jour
nalism nowadays is too apt to print
what is startling rather than what
is true."
President Jordan returned much
rested and in his usual good health,
glad to get back to the pleasant
climate of California.
