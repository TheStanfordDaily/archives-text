## Interesting Class Day Exercises Held by the 1901 Class. 
### 
The program opened on Thurs
day night with the presentation of
the startling melodrama "All But
Two, or Seven Dobbers Down," in
the assembly hall, before the larg
est crowd which has ever witnessed
a college theatrical performance on
the campus. The farce was a great
success, and the students who were
in the cast acquitted themselves
well.
Friday morning the Juniors won
the inter-class field-day, and inci
dentally the championship cup of
fered by the Associated Students,
thus making March 30th a Junior
Day indeed. The victorious team
captured 50 points out of a possible
116, their nearest competitors, the
Freshmen, having 48. The result
was in the balance till the last
event, the broad jump, which was
won by Symonds, '01, from Nara
more, '03, by the narrow margin of
an inch. The Sophomores won the
880-yard and the mile runs, and
succeeded in collecting 13 points,
while the Seniors came out first in
but one event, the pole-vault, and
when the score was counted they
had but five points to their credit.
In the afternoon a baseball game
between the Varsity and Santa
Clara drew a large crowd to the
campus diamond. The game was
distinguished by listless playing
and indiscriminate slugging of the
ball by both sides. The college men
won by a score of 10 to 8.
The Prom, in the evening given
in Encina Club room drew the
largest attendance in years, over
one hundred couples being present.
The large clubroom was tastefully
decorated with palms and red and
white bunting, the class colors. The
dancers overflowed the clubroom,
and many danced in the lobby,
which was prepared for the occa
sion. The Prom, continued until
after 2 o'clock, Yanke's orchestra
furnishing the music. Much of the
success of the dance is due to the
efforts of the arrangements commit
tee, under the leadership of P. K.
Gil man.
The day was a great financial
success, a handsome surplus being
netted the class, which will enable
them to start their senior year un
der brilliant auspices.
