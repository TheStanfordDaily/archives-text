# "STANFORD STORIES."
## First College Fiction by a Western University Accepted for Publication. 
### 
At last Stanford life is to be pre
sented in a general book of fiction.
"Stanford Stories, Tales of a Young
University," by Charles K. Field,
'95, and Will H. Irwin, '99, has
been accepted for publication by
Doubleday, Page & Co. of New
York, one of the strongest firms of
book publishers in the country, and
is to be issued in May. The an
nouncement is one of uncommon
interest to Stanford people, since
the book is to be placed on "sale
not only on the Pacific Coast but
throughout the country, and will
be a most effective advertisement
for the University.
The plan of collaborating on a
book of Stanford fiction occurred
to the authors over two years ago,
when one of them was still an un
dergraduate. At that time they
made a beginning, but abandoned
the scheme. About a year ago
they took the matter up again and
have since worked it out. The re
sult is fourteen stories of Stanford
life, representing as many phases
of the college as is possible in the
limited space. For the most part
these are fiction, but an attempt
has been made to give a true pic
ture of the University in atmos
phere, incident, and setting. In
only three out of the whole number
are the plots based on facts. Nor
have any real individuals been
chosen as characters. The people
are types, although one or two fol
low rather closely certain typical
Stanford men.
There are to be over two hundred
and fifty pages in all, with
eight half-tone illustrations. The
titles are as follows: Pocahontas,
Freshman; A Midwinter Madness;
His Uncle's Will; The Initiation
of Dromio; The Substituted Full
back; Two Pioneers and an Audi
ence; For the Sake of Argument;
An Alumni Dinner; The City of
Refuge; Bogg's Election Feed; In
the Dark Days; A Song-cycle and
a Puncture; Crossroads; One Com
mencement.
"Pocahontas, Freshman," is a
story of a subdued freshman year
and of a girl who dared. The scene
is laid at Roble and on the baseball
field during an old-time rush. "A
Midwinter Madness" is the tale of
a glee club trip, of a freshman with
the girl habit and a genius for tak
ing pains, and of a josh that failed.
"His Uncle's Will" and"The In
itiation of Dromio" deal with the
fraternity rushing season. "The
Substituted Fullback" has to do
with football, as the name indi
cates, and is mixed with a problem
in psychology. "Two Pioneers and
an Audience" and"In the Dark
Days" are sketches; the one treats
of the gay and boisterous days
when the Pioneers were freshmen,
and the other with the hard times
before the suit was won. "For the
Sake of Argument' 1 is a frank and
unblushing love story. "An Alumni
Dinner" tells of a "touching" inci
dent in the struggle of two A. B.'s
with the cold, cold world. "Hoggs 1
Election Feed" is a story of politics
and dark intrigue,and of an exam

ination that was flunked. "The
City of Refuge" and "Crossroads"
are the two serious stories of the
book. "A Song-cycle and a Punc
ture" is centered in a student comic
opera and a sophomore cotillion,
and "One Commencement," which
closes the volume, deals with an
incident of which every Stanford
enthusiast is proudâ€”the sailing of
the student volunteers on Com
mencement Day, 1898.
The authors have undertaken the
advance sale at Stanford, and
orders will be taken at once by C.
M. Bradley, S. P. Hardy, Miss
Clara Taber, and at the University
telegraph office. The price is $1.25
per copy delivered, or $1.35 mailed.
In a circular sent to the alumni
and ex-students the price was mis
takenly put at $1.50. It is re
quested that all students desiring
copies will subscribe at once.
The publication of "Stanford
Stories" by C. K. Field and Will
H. Irwin is a literary triumph of
no small note for the University,
being the first college stories pub
lished by a western university.
That they compare favorably in
color and plot with the stories is
sued by the older institutions of
the East is indicated by the words
of the conservative publisher, Mr.
Doubleday: "I consider these the
best college stories that have been
presented so far. 1 regard them as
unusual among stories of the class.
They are admirable in many
ways."
The authors need no introduc
tion to either the graduate or un
dergraduate of Stanford. Who has
not spent many delightful hours
with Carolus "Four-Leaf
Clover" ? The songs that he sang
will always be sung by Stanford
men. As the Class of '95 was the
creator of the Cardinal's spirit and
tradition, so was Field foremost
among the Pioneers, the creator of
the deeper spirit which is inspired
by song and story. He has been in
the insurance business since grad
uation, but has always kept in close
touch and sympathy with the prog
ress of his Alma Mater.
Will H. I rwin is the successor of
Carolus Ager as poet laureate.
Where Field left off Irwin began.
His work is familiar to many pres
ent undergraduates. His songs,
stories, poems, and plays are Uni
versity history. As a leader in
Stanford interests in every sphere,
Irwin was always a popular idol
while in college. Since graduating
he has been with The Wave in San
Francisco.
It would be difficult to find two
men better fitted to collaborate on
a book of Stanford Stories. Field
represents the old days of the Pio
neers, while Irwin brings us down
to the present time, having gradu
ated last year. Field was a frater
nity man, being a member of Zeta
Psi. Irwin was in close touch with
every phase of University life.
Their broad experience is perfectly
reflected in their work.
