This is the week when we can
show the true Stanford spirit in
a determination to do everything
possible towards a baseball victory
next Saturday. If we lose that
game, the baseball season of 1900
will close brilliantly successful for
our opponents. If we win, success
in the series will be fully half-way
ours. Every day will see hard
work on the part of the players,
and a good attendance of specta
tors each afternoon will add much
towards winning the game. Turn
out, every body, and then you will
have a right to complain if the re
sults of the season do not satisfy
you !
