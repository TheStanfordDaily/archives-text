I'. Drum, captain of the Berkeley
track team, visited Stanford this
morning and looked over the track
and field here, preparatory to the

field-day on the 21st. The Berke
ley men asked, among other things,
that movable standards be supplied
for the pole-vault and high-jump,
and that a longer run be given for
the vault. Stanford readily granted
these requests.
It was decided that entries would
be made next Saturday.
Before the field-day both ends of
the oval will be enclosed by fences
from the ends of the bleachers, and
the rest of the oval will be sur
rounded by a rope.
A provisional list of officials for
the field-day was decided upon, and
these men will be asked at once to
serve.
Drum and Decoto ex pressed them
selves as satisfied with the condi
tion of the track, the bleachers, and
the other arrangements. Drum
donned a suit and tried the track,
running a quarter in order to be
come familiar with the curve.
