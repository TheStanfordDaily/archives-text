# Senior Class Meeting.
## 
### 
The Senior Class met this after
noon in room 50 quad to discuss
the matter of a class assessment to
defray the expenses of the Senior
Week program. Upon motion of
B. C. Nichols, it was agreed to levy
an assessment of $3 instead of the
usual $5 assessment, the members
present believing that a larger num
ber of assessments could be col
lected at the lower rate, and thus
practically the same amount raised.
Plans for the Senior Week program
were considered, and several changes
were proposed.
