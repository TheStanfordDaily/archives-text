# Tennis and Memorial Plate.

### 
The regular meeting of the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Student
Body was held yesterday afternoon
at 4:30. There were present : Presi
dent Coverley, Vice-President Da
vis, Nichols, '00, Hoover, '01, Eng
lish, '01, Bradley, '02, and Cooper,
'02.
Thirty-one dollars was voted to
Tennis-Manager Hardy for the im
proving of the courts and for buying
balls for try-outs. Hardy stated
that it would be unwise to hold the
intercollegiate tennis match on the
campus unless one of the courts
was considerably repaired. He
estimated the cost of putting our
courts into shape for the tourna
ment at about $300, and offered the
further objection that they had
been laid out in the wrong direc
tions in the first place. They
should be made to run north and
south. In view of these facts, and
of the prospect of a new site for the
training-house and permanent ath
letic grounds, the committee de
cided to let the manager use his
own judgment as to holding the
tournament in San Francisco, as in
former years.
The committee empowered the
sub-committee to order the memo
rial plate in honor of the Stanford
volunteers in the late war. While
giving the order official sanction, it
is provided that the expense of the
tablet shall be met by the sale of
souvenir engravings or metal min
iatures of the tablet.
