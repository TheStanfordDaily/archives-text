# POOR BASEBALL FORM.
## Listless Playing Still Characterizes the Afternoon Practices. 
### 
Baseball prospects are do brighter
today than t hey were when Hunter
gathered in Murphy's pop fly in the
ninth inning of the first game of
1 lie championship series at Berke
ley last Saturday. Next Saturday
the U. C. team will comedown here
for the second game. Much de
pends upon this game —it is simply
a case of ."got to win."
How are the members of the
team looking forward to this return
match? From general appearances
the men, with three exceptions, do
not seem to be in the practice with
a determination to play ball all the
time. We will wait until the game,
and then key up and play ball in
the game, is their attitude. All
this is wrong. They want to key
up now. Do as the coach begs of
them to do, "Be in the game all
the time, even in practice,and then
you'll do the same in a big game."
This bit of advice is the most fa
miliar thing to the bleacher fan
that Dr. Murphy says.
Had the members of the team
heeded this advice last Saturday
the advantage would be on our side
instead of in favor of Berkeley.
To the side-liner it does not seem
possible that such inexcusable er
rors could have been made as were
made in the first, game. The scon
the rooters have against the team
will be, however, all wiped out it
t hey will only get together and play
bali all the time, like Varsity ball
players should play,and remember
that there is no glory or honor to
be gained in playing on a losing
team. Win the game I
The men have been out regularly
with the exception of Cowden, who
has been kept away on account of
illness. Lougheed still feels the
effect of the crack on the head he
received in the game on Saturday.
The side of his head is badly
bruised and when he moves around
quickly he is troubled with a diz
ziness. In practice last night Lan
agan let out bis arm. He expe
rienced no ill effects after the trial.
It has recovered from the soreness
that bothered him last week. Ha
vens is out to practice, but is nurs
ing a sore foot that Mien gave him
in a collision on first base.
The most noticeable feature in
the play of the practice games is the
decided brace the second team lias
taken. They have been out in
force, and several of the men are
after positions on the Varsity, not
withstanding the fact that they
were second choice a week ago, and
their chance is by no means hope
less.
The U. 0. tear)) will come down
Saturday on the train which ar
rives at Palo Alto at noon. A
large crowd of rooters is expected
to be with the train.
The new bleachers on the left
band side of the diamond will be
connected with the backstop by an
eight-foot board fence. The old
bleachers on the right-hand side
will also be similarly connected to
the backstop. From the end of the
bleachers, parallel with the foul
lines, ropes will be stretched in or
der to keep the crowd off the field.
