That Stanford University has
been decidedly lax in a fitting
recognition of its students who vol
unteered for war service is without
question. While their noble action
will never be forgotten by our col
lege students, and songs have been
written to preserve the memory of
their deeds, some tangible memor
ial is none the less needful to be
placed here on the campus. The
lately formed Volunteer Association
is well fitted to see that this action
is taken, but the student body as
a whole should be hardly less
interested than they. We hope
to see every encouragement given
to the present movement towards a,
Stanford volunteer memorial.
