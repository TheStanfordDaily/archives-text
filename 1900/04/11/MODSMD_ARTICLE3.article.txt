# Tennis Agreement.
## 
### 
Managers Hardy for Stanford
and Seiby for Berkeley have drawn
up an agreement to cover the inter
collegiate tournament this year.
The matches will be held on the
courts of the California Tennis
Club in San Francisco at 9 a.m.,
April 21, the morning of the field
day. As each is to be best two out
of three, instead of three out of five
as formerly, it is expected to finish
before noon. Besides this, there is
the further change that both singlet
will be played before the doubles,
and an agreement that the tourna
ment will be postponed two weeks
if weather interferes on the 21st.
For the try-out tournament on
the Eticina courts next Saturday
morning arrangements are about
completed. All entries must be
with Manager Hardy by tomorrow
(Thursday) noon. The courts will
be put in shape and arrangements
made for spectators.
