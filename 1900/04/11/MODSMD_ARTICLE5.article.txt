# Tuesday Evening Recital.

The recital last night tendered
by Leo Cooper and Henri Fair
weather, both of San Francisco, in
cluded much that was enjoyable.
Mr. Fairweathei Bang with sym
pathy and simplicity, and his se
lections and the grouping of his
program was in good taste. His
second number, consisting of the
"Gypsy Song," op. 112, No. 4
flirahm), "She Fled Before .Me,"
(Franz), and "My Soul, 1 Dip in
the Chalice ' ( Franz), made in their
order and combination an exceed
ingly agreeable effect. In his next
number be sang a trio of old but
nonetheless beautiful songs. Of
these, tHe most familiar, "Annie
Laurie," elicited the greatest ap
plause. The best song of the even
ing in respect to composition and
rendering was "Oh, Thou Sub
lime," i) V Wagner. Mr. Fair

weather has not a great voice, and
on the high notes it was sometimes
a little strident. Nevertheless, the
singer was delightful by reason of
an unaffected grace.
On the other hand, Mr. Cooper,
though possessing unusual tech
nical skill, and a wonderful speak
in,, voice, was less pleasing to our
college audience. Possibly the fail
ure was due to a program that was,
in the main, poorly selected. " Fra
Uracomo," by Robert Buchanan, is
naturally too melodramatic for
college men, and the rendering of
it was highly exaggerated. The
11 Kitchen Clock," by Vance Cheney,
is not a man's piece, and has been
given here by young women better
than Mr. Cooper or any other man
could do. Similarly " Luke,"
though by Bret 11 arte, may have
been of itself not of such temper
as to appeal to the sympathies of
college men.
Yet not all was due to the pro
gram. Any one who has heard
George Riddle recite "Come Here,"
and any one who remembers the
quiet and sympathetic manner of
Burbank, will perceive that Mr.
Cooper lacks that lenity of touch
which distinguishes the artist from
the ''professional" elocutionist. Mr.
Cooper erred most, however, in his
lack of seriousness. Hence there
was no background to his work.
In the selection from the "Merchant
of Venice," as in most of the other
numbers, he had worked out each
accent and inflection to a degree of
technical perfection. But he simply
waded through the part, leaving
little impression. After the scene
from Shakspere, there was read
from Heine a criticism on the
tragedy of Shy lock. Here Mr.
Cooper seemed to feel with and be
lieve what he read, for he had an
air of seriousness or severity that
made his reading truly delightful
and memorable.
