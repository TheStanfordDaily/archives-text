# The
						Memorial Tablet.
## 
### 
1 he subcommittee appointed by
the Executive Committee of the
student body has made final ar
rangements for a tablet to com
memorate our students who took
part in the recent war. The tablet
will In- two and a half by live feet,
will be made of bronze, and will
bear in raised letters, beside an ap
propriate legend, some eighty names
of those who at the time of partici
pating in the war were students,
ex-students, or alumni of this Uni
versity.
rhe tablet will probably be placed
in one of the atone buttresses in the
court between the arch and the
quadrangle. Such would be a
highly appropriate location, as Mrs.
Stanford intends to make the court
the most beautiful spot on the cam
pus. As at Harvard, sentiment
centern in the memorial chapel and
memorial tablet, so here it is ex
pected that this tablet, by reason of
what it symbolizes, will be the ob
ject of especial veneration.
In order that the students may
feel generally that they have a part
in placing this emblem, the Execu
tive Committee have deemed it best
to have struck off a large number
of engravings of the tablet or metal
miniatures for paper-weights that
will be sold for souvenirs.
