# ENGINEERING COLUMN.
## Items Gathered From the Various Departments During- the Week. 
### 
—Students in the Engineering
department surveyed the site for
the new chemical laboratory last.
Saturday. The building will be
located at the corner of the roads
which run by the Museum and Lto
ble.
—B. T. Vial! and G. F. Mad
dock made a test of the Palo Alto
municipal electric light plant dur
ing Easter week. The test in
cluded the efficiency of the engine,
boiler, generator, and distributing
system.
— Professors Marx and Smith are
working out a solution of the prob
lem of water supply for the cam
pus. Water will probably be
pumped from wells near the rail
road track to a reservoir on the hills
back of the quad. The work will
be done during the summer.
-The trustees of the city of
Riverside have called an election to
vote on the proposition of issuing
$-1,000 worth of bonds to provide
the means for erecting a municipal
steam electric plant. The proper
equipment of the central station is
the problem upon which Professors
Copeland and G. H. Marx have just
completed their final report as con
sulting engineers to the city.
— Professor Smith and Godbold
the chief engineer, have designed a
separator to lie used in connection
with the straight-line engine in the
University power-house. This is a
device to remove the water from
the steam before it enters the en
gine cylinder. It is in the form of
a cylinder, eighteen inches in diam
eter and twelve inches high, con
nected to a five-inch steam pipe at
the side and bottom. The steam
enters the side inlet, and is con
strained to move in a circle, which
will have a tendency to throw the
water contained in the steam toward
the outer part of the separator,
where it is caught by riffles cast
upon the inside and carried off as
waste through a steam trap. The
work on this separator, including
pattern-making, casting, and ma
chine work, will be done here at the
U Diversity.
— The UDiversity blacksmith shop
is one of the best equipped institu
tions of the kind in the country.
It has a floor space of forty by
eighty feet, and contains twenty
live forges and anvils, and ten
benches with vises. The forges were
designed especially for this place,
and each is furnished with a coal
box, a trough with water connec
tions, and a full complement of
tools. A fan furnishes an air blast
for each forge. The fan is run
by an electric motor, which also
furnishes power for emery and pol
ishing wheels. There are fifty-six
students taking forge work. This
semester the course has been given
only during the afternoons, but
next semester it will probably be
given during the morning also.
The students make from iron,
weldings, rings, hooks, clevises,
ch«iins, and tongs ; from steel, screw
drivers, punches, coldchhels, ham
mers, and stone drills. They also
temper all the latter, and do brazing
