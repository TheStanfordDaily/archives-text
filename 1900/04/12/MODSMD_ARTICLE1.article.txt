# LEIPZIG SEMINARIES.
## Professor Spencer Writes to History Department on His Work in Germany. 
### 
Professor Spencer of the History
department, who is spending his
sabbatical year in study at Leipzig,
recently wrote an extended des
cription to Dr. Howard concerning
his first impressions of the German
seminaries. It came by way of
greeting on the occasion of the
opening of the new seminary room.
The normal date for beginning
work was October 16th,but the sem
inary did not get started until
November 4th. Concerning the
external appliances for seminary
work, the Leipzig seminar proba
bly has the largest quarters and
best equipment of any university
in the world. The library of Ger
man History is large and extens
ive but, owing to the students not
being permitted to use the card
catologues, and the distance of the
seminar buildings from the gen
eral university library, the facili
ties for work are not as good as
they might be.
On the evening of November 3d,
the members of all the seminars
met with the professors for organ
ization. The main features were
registration, payment of fees, and
a brief address by Professor Marcks,
after which all, in Professor Spen
cer's words, "went to partake of
refreshments." The seminars
have no secretaries and keep no
minutes.
There are four history seminars
at Leipzig of about 80 students
in all. Those of Lamprecht and
Marcks work in modern history
and those of Wachsmuth and
Seeliger in ancient and medieval.
The first two professors admit no
women to their work. Only one
young woman was present for regis
tration. In Lamprecht's seminar
there are three Americans, one
Roumanian and two Bulgarians.
This professor spent the first two
sessions in a discussion of the na
ture and scope of history, after
which he proceeded to the study of
municipal development in Germany
in the sixteenth century and the
development of absolutism in
Austria. Every student has a
twelve-page printed copy of the
charter of privileges granted July
19, 1567, by the city of Hamburg to
the merchant adventurers of Lon
don. This document is discussed
paragraph by paragraph. Some
member is called upon to translate
a section, after which Lamprecht
makes it the nucleus of remarks
regarding such features of city
life and institutions as it suggests.
On the whole, Professor Spencer
feels thoroughly satisfied with his
work thus far. He considers Lamp
recht a man whose influence fifty
years hence will be seen to have
been as great in our day as was
that of Ranke in the '30's, and
no other historical scholar rep
resents more ably than Marcks,
whose seminar Professor Spencer is
also attending, the scientific criti
cal methods that have been built
up in the last fifty years.
