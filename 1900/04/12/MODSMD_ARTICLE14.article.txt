A (iitoi> many remarks have heÂ»>n
made lately on the absence of tlie
caps and gowns of the Senior
women. Last, year the women made
their lirst appearance in them he

fore Thanksgiving, and from that
time on the majority of the Seniors
wore their caps. But this year they
have not carried out the precedent
set hy last year's class. A few scat
tered ones appeared on Junior Day,
hut since that time not one has
been seen on the quad. All the
girls have their caps and gowns,
and why not wear them from now
on. instead of wailing until Com
mencement ?
