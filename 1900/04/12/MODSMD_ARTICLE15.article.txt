# PROFITABLE SUMMER WORK.
## Good Opportunity for Stanford Students. 
### 
In these (lays when so many men
are dependent, in whole or in part,
upon their own exertions for getting
through college,it is a problem with
many of them how to get the most
from their vacation. Probably the
best paying and most appropriate
employment which a college man
can take up, temporarily, is that
offered by the Powers-Higby Com
pany of Chicago, which has charge
of the introduction of one branch
of the Chatauqua system of home
education. A salary of from eighty
to one hundred and lifty dollars a
month, according to locality and
other circumstances, is assured.
Besides the salary, the work affords
an opportunity of seeing the world
and its people, which is invaluable
to one who spends most of his time
in the little world of college affairs.
The representative of the com
pany, Howard Findley, wishes to
secure the services of a number of
men from Stanford. Many of the
prominent men of the University
have already decided to take up the
work, and anyone who may have a
month or more to spend is invited
to call upon him and look into the
matter. He may be seen in room
91 Encina. Calls should be made
upon him as early as possible.
