# U.C. Concert Here.
## 
### 
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
are resuming rehearsals, and have
in view a concert on the Berkeley
campus the first week in May, be
sides one or two more in the valley,
and a matinee at the California
Theater in San Francisco. Both
clubs will be able to vary the regu
lar program somewhat by new
music. An evening in West Side,
near Los Gatos, is contemplated
some time in April. The village
and surrounding country is capa
ble of giving a large house, and the
entertainment will be under the
auspices of a local organization that
will assure a good patronage.
The next important event in a
musical way to take place on our
campus will be the appearance of
the U. C. Glee, Mandolin, and Banjo
Clubs in the assembly hall the even
ing of the field-day, April 21st.
The visiting clubs are sure to be
greeted by an immense audience.
A large portion of the field-day
crowd will listen to the concert in
the evening, and this will benefit
the student bodies of each univer
sity equally, as each is to receive
one-half the proceeds. The U. C.
clubs this year, since the costly
northern tour, have been working
industriously to pay off their enor
mous deficit. They are scheduled
to play every Saturday night at
different places, and at present are
playing a season of four nights at
the Grand Opera House in the city.
The clubs are in excellent condi
tion, and are giving a high-grade
entertainment. The Glee appears
four times, and the Mandolin Club
and Banjo Club play two numbers
apiece. The remainder of the pro
gram is supplied by H. G. Poheim,
a violinist; G. P. Gray and E. B.
Harris, monologists, and Milton
Schwartz and R. W. Tully in an
original sketch, " J am General
Otis." These specialties are all said
to be very entertaining. Further
announcements in connection with
the concert will be made later.
