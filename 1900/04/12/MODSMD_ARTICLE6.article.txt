# Guild Entertainment.
## 
### 
On Saturday evening, April Bth,
the entertainment which the direc
tors of the Students' Guild are ar
ranging, will take place in the
assembly hall. The Guild is do

ing all in its power to raise
money to complete the furnishing
of the woman's sitting-room, and
it is for this purpose that the enter
tainment has been planned.
"The Red Vampire,'.' a comedy
by Professor Hudson is to be given
by the faculty dramatic club. The
comedy is a more ambitious effort
than the sketch "Manifest Destiny"
which Professor Hudson put on so
successfully at the Christian Asso
ciation reception recently, and its
presentation will require a greater
number of the club's members.
The girls' glee and the girls'
mandolin clubs are to assist the
dramatic club and each will have
two or more numbers on the pro
gram.
