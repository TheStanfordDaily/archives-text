# DECISIVE GAME TOMORROW.
## Second of the Intercollegiate Series on Our Campus in the Afternoon. 
### 
Berkeley and Stanford come to
gether on our campus tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30 for the second
game of the series for the baseball
championship.
Tomorrow's game is the decisive
one. If Berkeley wins, they take
home the championship for 1900;
if Stanford pulls down a victory,
we have a lease of life on the cham
pionship as the score in games will
then be a tie, and to decide which
team is the better it will be neces
sary to play another game. If the
Varsity wins tomorrow, the third
game will be pulled off on neutral
ground, in all probability at Recre
ation Park in San Francisco.
Since the loss of the first game
on the U. C. campus last Saturday,
the members of the team have been
hard at work getting in shape for
this game. They have nothing to
say in regard to their defeat. They
frankly admit that poor playing,
inexcusable errors, lost the game,
and to a man they believe that the
final score will balance in favor of
the Cardinal after tomorrow's con
test.
Last night's practice was en
couraging. All the men were in
the game and played ball all the
time. The outfield took care of
everything that came their way,
while the infield delighted in hard
chances. The change in the line
up worked to good advantage. The
substitution of Brown for Cowden
at second livened up the work
around that bag. Edwards and
Brown work together better than
Cowden and Edwards did. Brown
is fast and accurate with ground
balls, and a sure catch on thrown
balls. Cowden, in Hampson's place
in left field, did good work, cover
ing ground and holding everything
he got his hand on. As before
mentioned, the change in the line
up will work well against Berkeley,
because it puts more ginger in the
infield and strengthens the outfield.
The rest of the line-up will remain
the same. These players all ought
to show improvement over their
play in the exhibition against U. C.
Lanagan will pitch. He will be
steadier in this game than in last
Saturday's game as he has had the
benefit of a week's practice which
he did not have before he went into
the first game on account of a sort!
arm. Lougheed at the receiving
end of the battery has been troubled
all week with the injury on the
side of his head that he received
last Saturday, but he hopes to be
in shape to play his usual game.
If he plays as well in the second
game as he did in the first game
the fans will have nothing but
praise for him.
Besides the marked improvement
in fielding in last night's practice,
the batting of the team has picked
up. The Varsity had their batting
eye with them and some rattling
good hits were made.
The game will be called at 2:30.
O'Conijel will be the umpire.
The seating accommodations for the
grounds have been doubled by the
addition of new bleachers, so that

there will be plenty of room for
spectators. The baseball game of
the season can be expected, for both
sides have made up their minds to
win.

CALIFORNIA. STANFORD.
Kaarsburg p Lanagan
Smith c Lougheed

Fuller 2 b Brown
Hunter s. s Edwards
