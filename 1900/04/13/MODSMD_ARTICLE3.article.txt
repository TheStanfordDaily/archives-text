# Intercollegiate Debate Unsettled.
## 
### 
L. B. Wickersham, '00, of the in
tercollegiate debating committee,
went to San Francisco this morn
ing for a conference with F. W.
Aitken of the University of Califor
nia, to arrange for those details of
the intercollegiate debate pertain
ing to printing, hall, etc. The date
of holding the debate has not yet
been settled, owing to the tardiness
of the Berkeley committee. This
will be arranged within a day or
two, however, and will be either
April 28th or May sth, depending
upon the ability of certain judges
to be present. Work on the selec
tion of the judges is being carried
on, and it is hoped that they will
be decided upon within another
week or two.
