# Strength Tests.
## 
### 
Trial strength tests are now being
held at the gymnasium by Dr.
Heaver to determine the fifty
strongest men in the university and
to choose a representative for the
individual strength championship
of American colleges. These tests
will continue until the latter part
of April, when the records of the
first fifty strong men in the univer
sity will he published. These tests
are taken under the following reg
ulations: All of the tests must be
made consecutively in the order
mentioned and be completed within
fifteen minutes. A rest of one min
ute will be allowed between the
tests for the strength of the upper
arms (triceps) and chest, and the
strength of upper arms (biceps)
and back, as these are usually taken

to test the power of repeating efforts
and to try the action of the heart
and lungs.
By the first of May each institu
tion will publish the record of its
fifty strongest men. The individ
ual having the highest total shall
be deemed the champion strong
man of all the colleges, and the in
stitution having the fifty strongest
men, decided by the largest total
score, shall hold the strength trophy
for next year.â€” Yale News.
