The recently awakened deter
mination of the.baseball men to win
out this season in spite of their
poor beginning, while somewhat
delayed, nevertheless does not come
entirely too late to yet bring us
victory. The student body has
very justly complained, almost
throughout the season,of their lack
of energy, and even the coach has
declared them unworthy of the
popular support they have received.
They came to life lust Saturday,
however, from present indications
to stay. They will certainly re
ceive the interest and atten
tion during their two weeks of
practice before the decisive game
which has characterized baseball
throughout this season. The mem
ber of the squad who carelessly or
wontonly allows anything to come
between Stanford and thatgame will
very justly deserve the terms which
will as surely he applied to him.
All eyes will be upon the develop
ment, of the team for their final
test a week from next Saturday.
