# Debating Arrangements.
## 
### 
L. B. Wickersham, '00, of the
Stanford intercollegiate debating
committee, held a conference in the
city Saturday with the Berkeley
committee, Aitken, O'Connor, and
Fisher. The debate is to be held
at Metropolitan Temple 011 the
night of May sth. The presiding
officer is to be a man selected from
the faculty of Stanford University.
Berkeley people and their friends
are to have seats on the right-hand
side of the house, Stanford on the
left.
Wickersham, as the Stanford rep
resentative, proposed that twenty
five cents be charged for seats. This
would be something of an innova
tion, as all previous debates have
been held free, but the ad visibility
of such a plan is clearly evident.
It would provide funds for defray
ing the expense of holding the de
bate, and avoid the danger of a too
crowded house, besides securing a
more appreciative audience. Owing
to the novelty of this proposition,
the U. C. representatives would
come to 110 decision upon the mat
ter, but promised to refer it to the
students at Berkeley and report
their decision within a, few days.
The judges who shall decide the de
bate have not yet been agreed upon.
