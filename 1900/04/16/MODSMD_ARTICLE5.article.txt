# EASTER SERVICES.
## Dr. Miller Preached in the Chapel Yesterday on "Easter." 
### 
Easter Sunday was observed by
special services in the chapel. Dr.
Miller delivered the sermon, on ihe
subject " Easter." He chose for
his text Col. iii, 1-3, '' [112 ye then
he risen with Christ, seek those
things which are above, where
Christ sitteth on the right hand of
God. Set your affectionsjm things
above, not on things of the earth.
For ye are dead and your life is
hid with Christ in God." Dr. Mil
ler said in part:
"Our service this morning, if it
has any particular significance "to
us, is the celebration of the resur
rection of our Lord Jesus Christ
from the dead with all the mean
ing of that event to us and to the
world to which he came. And that
must be our theme.
"Taken by itself the Christian
teaching on the subject of the res
urrection of Christ has from the
earliest time been assailed by many
objections. But it is not fair to
take any of the elements, the cap
ital elements, of the history of
Jesus and to discuss it as if it stood
alone. They are organic elements;
they belong to a composite whole;
and we cannot get the best and
truest light except we discuss not
simply ihe probable value of single
individual features, but of the
combined whole. We must first
put all the parts together accurate
ly; for that which they are is not
simply what each is by itself, but
what they are by their symmetry
and proportions to each other.
" Now, the history of our Savior
must be judged in the like manner
as a whole, and not merely in its
separate elements. No single fea
ture of the revelation of God in
Jesus Christ, followed in the lighl
of foregoing probabilities.
"That, he should have been born
among Ihe Jews would seem strange
to every nation except the Jews;
that he should have been b«rn of it
family of Nazareth, incomprehen
sible to them. His birth in a
stable, his life as a wanderer with
nowhere to lay his head. And
finally the grandest, saddest scene
the scene on Calvary. But lie
who had come from heaven to lift
up the race; he who had walked
among those who are most needy;
he who had joined the infinite
jiower of God to men at the point
of the lowest human weakness; that
he might lift the race out of the
sphere in which they were born
into a higher sphere—he, in dyin b ,
gave a moral significance to death
which was wholly revolutionary,
for through dying he brought life
and immortality to light and death
was swallowed up in victory.
■'God judges men, not by quanti
ty but by quality not by extent
but by faithfulness, whether in
little or in much. 1 may be able
to do less than you, and less may
be expected of me; but 1 am just
as surely bound to do my little as
you are to do your much.
M The freed spirit is no instan
taneous creation. Every victory
through all the years is an essen
tial element in it. Some take
longer steps in resurrection than

others, and as we rise, ii' w'e raise
others witli us, we become not
merely resurrected, but the power
of God's ministering angels of res
urrection to others. Let us lake
the earnest of it.and the foretaste
of it that bye and bye the full
blessedness of it may be ours."
