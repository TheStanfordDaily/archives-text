# Faculty Farce Date.
## 
### 
Friday evening, April 27th, has
been definitely settled upon as the
date for the presentation by the
Faculty Dramatic Club of Pro
fessor Hudson's original farce,
"The Lied Vampire." '1 he com
plete program will be announced
soon, there being numbers by the
Varsity CI lee and Mandolin Clubs
and by the Stanford Glee, the
girls' club. The entertainment
will lie given in the assembly hall,
and an entrance fee of twenty-five
cents will be charged, the proceeds
to be devoted to the fitting up of
the lately established women's
sitting room.
As this is the only appearance
of the Faculty Dramatic Club this
semester they will undoubtedly be
greeted by a full house. The pa
tronesses of the Students' Guild
have the affair in charge.
