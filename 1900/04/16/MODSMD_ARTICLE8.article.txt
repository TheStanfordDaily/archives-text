# U.C. Track Men Here.
## 
### 
Captain Drum of Berkeley came
down Saturday with his track team
for the purpose of trying out his
men on our oval. The full list of
events for the field-day was gone
through, although no attempts were
made at records. Drum expressed
himself as entirely satisfied with
our track and with the accommo
dations which have been made for
the visiting team.
