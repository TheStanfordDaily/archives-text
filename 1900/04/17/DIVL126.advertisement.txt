ly reliable remedy in all forms of consti

and sluggishness of the liver.
Medical statistics conclusively prove
that at least 90 per cent of the American

lets, is a true Liver Tonic and gen.tle
laxative, hence a positive cure for consti
pation, biliousness, dyspepsia, sickhead-

oases yield to these small tablets.

remedy for constipation, biliousness and
