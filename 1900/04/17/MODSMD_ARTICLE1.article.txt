# FIELD-DAY ENTRIES.
## Stanford's Chances in the Annual Track Meet on Our Campus Saturday. 
### 
The last week of training for the
track men opens auspiciously.
While conditions do not warrant
the expectation of a victory for
Stanford in the intercollegiate field
day meet Saturday, the partisans
are likely to see some interesting
contests. Thanks to the careful
supervision of Manager Cantwell
and Dr. Murphy, the men, with one
or two exceptions, are in the best of
condition. Nourse, who has been
laid off for a time by an injury, is
training steadily again. Chad
bourne's leg still bothers him, but
he is hard at work at the distance
event. The only doubtful man in
the invalid corps is Dole, who
turned an ankle in practice recently,
and can do no jumping until the
field-day. McCaughern, the sprinter
from New Hampshire, has recovered
from his fall, and if his perform
ance at Reno counts for anything,
is a point-winner for the Varsity.
Manager Cantwell had a confer
ence Saturday with Manager Decato
of Berkeley, one of the results of
which is that Service, California's
half-miler, will be debarred from
competing. Service's name was not
in the list which Professor Bacon
submitted to our management, and
consequently he is ineligible. Berke
ley's manager protested against our
action in refusing to consider his
entry. The ruling is 011 the same
principle as that which prevented
John and Naramore from playing
in the Freshman football game.
The track, with good weather,
will he in excellent condition. The
seating accommodations will be in
creased by the removal of the base
ball bleachers to the oval. Near
the track two tents are to be erected,
to be used as dressing-rooms by the
opposing teams.
