The students hope that Presi
dent Jordan may see tit before the
semester's close to give here the
lecture which he delivered in the
East. That we are always eager
to hear anything he may have to
say is proved by the attendance
which an announcement of his ap
pearance always draws. It cer
tainly is impossible for outsiders
to take any more interest in his
speeches than would we here at
Stanford, and furthermore, we are
selfish enough to want to hear all
he says.
