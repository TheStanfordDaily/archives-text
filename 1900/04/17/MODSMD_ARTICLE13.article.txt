The announcement published by
the liverymen of Palo Alto an
nouncing that a twenty-five cent
rate will be charged on surreys and
carriages between the campus and
Palo Alto deserves the condemna
tion and earnest opposition of the
entire student body. Outside of a
few tourists in the spring season,
the liverymen of Palo Alto owe
their business primarily to the stu
dents. This raise in price h;is all
the earmarks of a "put up" job.
They say that buses will remain at
the same rate. However, there are
but few buses in Palo Alto and the
liverymen will take pains to see
that these are not. ut the station lo
meet trains. Consequently, the
student will suffer. He will he
forced to either take a surrey at

twenty-five cents or else wal-k. (
Then, again, the field-day'on Sat-;
urday will attract a large crowd,
most of them strangers, who will
beat the mercy of the bus men,
and it is distinctly an injustice to
them, besides creating an unfavor
able prejudice against the UiHver-j
sity, for the the bus men to charge j
such an exorbitant rate. Such a
high handed proceeding, if persisted
in, should result either in the much
talked of plan of a street railway j
line between the campus and Palo
Alto or-a firm boycott of (he Palo
Alto bus men. A united stand by
the student body should show the
liverymen tli.it they have taken
one step too many in their ai bi-j
trary control of the University
transportation business.
