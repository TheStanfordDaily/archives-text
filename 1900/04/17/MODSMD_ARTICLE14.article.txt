# Palo Alto Team Wins.
## 
### 
The first outside game of the
Palo Alto Basket-ball Club was
played with the Lowell High School
last Saturday forenoon on Casilleja
court, resulting in a score of four to
two in favor of the Palo Alto Club.
For the Lowell High School the
two guards, Miss Kingsbury and
Vida Ducker, the Palo Alto sub,
put up the best game. Miss Ducker
took the place of the Lowell cap
tain, who retired with a sprained
ankle early in the game.
The strength of the team rep
resenting the Palo Alto Club lay,
not so much in the individual
players, but in the team as a whole.
The game was a good one al
though somewhat delayed by the
incidental injuries of the different
players. At the close of the second
half Miss* Hay had scored two
points for Palo Alto and Miss
Ducker two points for Lowell.
Five additional minutes were given
in which to play off the tie, re
sulting in the score mentioned
above.
