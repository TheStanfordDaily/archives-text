# Moving the Bleachers.
## 
### 
This afternoon trucks are being
placed under the bleachers at the
baseball diamond preparatory to
moving them up beside those at
the oval. This will give a seating
capacity of 2000 people for the
field day next Saturday. When
completed the bleachers will extend
the full length of the home stretch,
and will afford an unobstructed
view of the finish in all the track
events.
