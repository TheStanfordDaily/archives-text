# Senior Farce Writers.
## 
### 
A Stanford audience does not
want to nee a class stage a farce
written abroad if it can be helped.
This is what the Senior Class is
likely to do unless more activity is
shown by Stanford genius, past
and present, in providing for them
a play for Senior Week. There are
men who are willing to write under
contract, and they would undoubt
edly produce a meritorious drama,
but the committee considers the
precedent a bad one to establish.
Other students asked questions,
said they had ideas, but their prop
ositions are in the air.
The only two persons who have
actually entered the contest are
" Johnnie" Briscoe, ex-'OO, and K.
Robson, who is taking postgrad
uate work here. The former is
known as the author of last year's
Junior farce, " Golf and Politics,"
and for his reputation as a local
comedian. Iv. Robson has done
creditable work on the Sequoia,
and has written for magazines.
