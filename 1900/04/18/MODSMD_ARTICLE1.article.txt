# NEW BUS LINE CONTEMPLATED
## Automobiles to be Used with a Five Cent Fare and Regular Time Schedule. 
### 
There is a movement on foot to
start an automobile bus line from
Palo Alto to the University. This
plan has been under consideration
for some time, but it has not been
brought out prominently because
the men who are behind the scheme
wanted to be sure that they would
be well received and could push
their venture to a successful issue.
The action of the Palo Alto bus
men has to*j)Ublish
the fact that they intend to putin
a complete system of transporta
tion such as Stanford has needed
for a long time. The innovation is
being worked up by two well-known
graduate students and backed by a
San Francisco firm which handles
horseless carriages. The promot
ers refuse to give their names un
til they have obtained the concess
ion of a ten year franchise giving
them the exclusive privilege to
operate automobiles on the campus.
If this concession is granted the
new company will give a system of
transportation which will be com
plete in every detail, besides being
a novel and attractive feature of
the University. They guarantee
to have a fixed fare of five cents
one way and to run a bus holding
twenty people every twenty min
utes. The route traveled by the
bus would be from the corner of
Waverley street and University
avenue down University avenue
to the west end of the quad, up
around the Lasuen row by way of
the postoffice, and down Salva
tierra row, around lfincina gym
nasium to Encina hall, from the
hall to the east end of the quad,
and from there to Palo Alto. This
would be the regular route over
which a bus would pass every
twenty minutes. The schedule
would be arranged to take in the
trains and to give accommodation
to the Palo Alto students for the
8:15 recitations.
Friends of the promoters of the
scheme are planning to circulate a
petition to which they hope to get
three fourths of the names of the
people connected with the Univer
sity who will promise to support
the new company for one year.
