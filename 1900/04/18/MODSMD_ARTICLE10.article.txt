The prompt action being taken
to meet the exorbitant raise in the
University bns fares should show
the liverymen that their new scale
of prices will only work their own
ruin. While the plan has the ap
pearance of being only a scheme to
double profits from the increased
business of field-day next Saturday,
it deserves the energetic opposition
of a permanent attempt. We hope
it will not only be met by the com
bined University population, but
that it may prove productive of
what Stanford has long needed, a
moderate and reliable transporta
tion service.
