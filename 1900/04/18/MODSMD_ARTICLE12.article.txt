# Noted Architect Here.
## 
### 
Herr Max Junghaendel, the
editor of several large architectur
al publications in Germany, is a
guest at Encina hall. He is com
piling the material for a work on
American architecture and came
here to continue his studies on
universities, which will form the
subject of one of the first parts of
his forthcoming publication. Herr
Junghaendel has traveled extens
ively in nearly all the countries of
Europe and the Orient, and has
edited several high-class publica
tions in collaboration with scient
ists of international fame, among
whom are George Ebers, Gaston
Maspero, George Rawlinsop, and
I'edro Madrazo.
During his stay of some weeks
here Herr Junghaendel will be
chiefly occupied in studying the
physical influences of architectural
surroundings, with special refer
ence to schools, libraries, and uni
versities. It might not be out of
the way to state that his influence
has already been felt on the Coast.
It was he whose criticism of the
University of California architec
tural competition in the San Fran
cisco papers several weeks since
caused considerable comment. He
declared that great scheme a failure
as it had not produced a plan of
practical value and appropriate
American character.
