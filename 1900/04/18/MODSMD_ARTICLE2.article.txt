# President Jordan Meets Yost.
## 
### 
The first Stanford man to tell us
definitely of our new coach is Dr.
Jordan. During his recent eastern
trip and while stopping for a few
days at the University of West Vir
ginia at Morguntown, West Vir
ginia, Dr. Jordan met Yost and
they had a talk together, and
discussed the whole football situa
tion for 1900 at Stanford Univer
sity.
In a recent interview on that
meeting at Morguntown, Dr. Jordan
very kindly gave his impressions
of our new coach. He Yost
has a bearing and manner very
much like Chamberlin; in fact,
resembles Chamberlin in many
ways. He has the same cordial
spirit, the same hand-shake to be
remembered long afterwards, and
the same general air of simplicity.
Yost is a southern type of man,

which fact he betrays in his vocab
ulary and manner.
The thing about Yost that im
pressed Dr. Jordan exceedingly
was his power to get immediately
at the heart of a subject, especially
so as to the football situation.
The President said that he has sel
dom if ever seen a man as coach
of a football team in the West
more thoroughly alive to his bus
iness, more confident of his own
power and ability, or one who
makes a more lasting impression
of sincerity and straight-forward
ness. Yet wehave nothing to expect
of the society man of superficial
polish or veneer in our new coach.
He is a man who wins you by his
warm Southern nature and man
ner.
In speaking of the choice of Yost
over the men of the" Big Four," Dr.
Jordan said in substance, that he
was surprised when he learned that
a man from a 'secondary college
had been chosen to coach our team,
but when he saw the man and
talked with him he was convinced
that no mistake had been made
For he is a man " with a good eye,
a powerful physique, one who has
confidence in himself, and one
whose past work justifies future
hopes."
