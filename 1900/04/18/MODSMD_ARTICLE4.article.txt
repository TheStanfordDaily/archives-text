# Berkeley Clubs' Concert.
## 
### 
Saturday evening, April 21st, the
Berkeley Glee,Banjo,and Mandolin
Clubs will give a concert in the as
sembly ball after tbe field-day.
This is something of an innova
tion, as the Stanford musical clubs
will likewise appear on the Berke
ley campus in a concert two weeks
later. This will offer the first good
opportunity of forming a compari
son between the musical ability of
Stanford and Berkeley. Besides
selections by tbe Berkeley Glee,
Mandolin, and Banjo Clubs, Tuilv,
Schwartz, and Morse will also ap
pear in monologue, and tbe pro
gram will include tbe minstrel
features that were such a success
last week at tbe Grand Opera House.
Beserved seats for tbe concert at
fifty cents will be on sale tomorrow
(Thursday) and Friday at the Uni
versity postoffice.
The special train from the cam
pus will return to tbe city after the
concert, enabling visitors to at
tend.
