# PRESIDENT JORDAN LECTURES.
## Illustrated Talk on the Passion Play Crowds the Chapel Last Evening. 
### 
By request of some members of
the faculty who expect to go abroad
this summer, Dr. Jordan repeated
his lecture on the "Passion-Play at
Oberammergau" last evening in the
chapel. A great number were un
able to get into the building.
In beginning, he spoke of the
Alps and their most charming por
tion, the Bavarian Oberland, with
the valley of the river Ainmer and
its famous village of Oberammer
gau.
This town, long and straggling,
with narrow, crooked streets, a typ
ical German village, has a popula
tion of about 1300 people, given
mainly to wood-carving or the man
ufacture of cheese. Here remains
the only relic of the medieval mir
acle-play, the "Passion-Play," med
ieval only in its origin, but modern
in its form, with all grotesque and
barbarous features eliminated from
time to time and kept strictly in
harmony with the best of modern
good taste. The play as represented
in 1890 holds a high place in Ger
man literature, and as the work of
Father Deisenberger, who wrote it
"for the love of the Divine Father,"
represents in full the story of
Christ's Passion with such minor
incidents omitted as would keep the
whole from being one continuous
action.
The play is presented every Sun
day during the summer of each
tenth year by the natives of the vil
lage, only the best and strongest
people being allowed to take part.
To be a participant in the play is
considered the noblest career, and
training is begun while very young
and continued, if strength of pur
pose and talent warrant, through
out life, roles being taken accord
ing to age and ability.
The play is announced by can
non boom, begins at eight in the
morning and, allowing an hour for
dinner, continues until half-past
five in the afternoon.
A chorus of the town's best sing
ers opens the play and in tableaux
given between the acts prefigure the
real incidents. Everything con
nected with the performance is made
as realistic as possible and the in
tense earnestness of the actors is
sufficient to justify the presenta
tion in its life-like manner. "The
actors do not seem to act, but grow
up into living figures through de
votion to one thing." Their dress
is of real material, rich and bril
liant, and the coloring, itself a work
of great art, is in harmony with the
characters represented.
The women in general are not
attractive and in the men there is
something of the cow face. The
stage is large and wide; five hun
dred persons are sometimes on it
at the same time. The scenery is
magnificent and the equipment
modern. The music, while not the
best according to the great masters,
is all that village talent can make
it, and the artistic arrangement,
under the management of the dra w
ing master, conies very near to high
art.
Dr. Jordan gave an interesting

detailed account of each act in the
play and then explained the pic
tures illustrating the most striking
features and scenes. The group of
pictures are of particular interest,
for they are reproductions of the
only photographs ever taken of the
actors.
