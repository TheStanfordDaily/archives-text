E. E. Farmer, '95, instructor in
Electrical Engineering from '95 to
'97, has spent the last two years in
advanced study in Paris. He has
been offered an instructorship in
Electrical Engineering here, and
President Jordan has just received
his letter of acceptance.
The department of Electrical
Engineering is fortunate in secur
ing again the services of F. CI.
Baum, who returns next year, after
having been engaged in practical
work in the Blue Lakes transmis
sion system and with the Stanley

Blue Lakes company he had occas

calculations under the direction of
Professor Perrine. He has been
engaged in the switchboard and
instrument departments of the
Stanley Electric Co., of which Dr.
Perrine is president, where he has
invented a new and improved watt
meter, ammeter and a phase in

has written many articles for the
Physical Revieiv and the Electrical
World and Engineer on the trans
former, motor tester, bridge-meth
ods, and allied subjects. His thesis
