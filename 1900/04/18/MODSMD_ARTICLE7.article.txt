# Geology Society Formed.

### 
Sigma Gamma, an honorary so
ciety composed of students inter
ested in Geology and Mining
Engineering, has recently been or
ganized at the University. It is
modeled after the general princi
ples of Phi Beta Kappa, the hon
orary scholarship fraternity that
exists in most of the larger Ameri
can universities. The Geology and
Mining faculty, who are members
of the society, select two-thirds of
the students from the upper classes
of the department, being those that
they consider the best scholars, and
those students in other departments
who have shown an especial inter
est in geology ; and the society
elects two-thirds of those proposed
by the faculty members to member
ship. As the number of students
in the department increases, the
proportion selected will be de
creased, and membership restricted
probably to seniors and graduates.
The society will hold monthly
meetings, at which two papers will
be read each time by members, em
bodying the results of their original
investigations and experiences.
These papers will be presented in
permanent form in the proceedings
of the society. Sigma Gamma may
in time extend to some of the other
principal schools of geology and
mining of the country.
