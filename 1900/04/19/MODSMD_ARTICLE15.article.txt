The announcement that we shall
have an opportunity to meet Mrs.
Stanford at her home soon is re
ceived with much pleasure by Jthe
whole student body. Her meetings
with the students are just frequent
enough to make them what we all
desire they should be, the most
pleasant social events of our Uni
versity career. We are all of us
anxious to show our appreciation
of what has been done for us and
welcome accordingly the chance
given ub to meet our benefactress,
still active for our interests, in her
own home.
