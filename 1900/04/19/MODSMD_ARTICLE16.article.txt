The attempts made in the nom
inations of this afternoon's student
body meeting to make light of the
persistance which haß been shown
in track athletics should have re
ceived a much colder reception than
it did. Men who remain active in
a sport merely to assist the devel
opment of others and build up the
success of those athletics deserve
far more credit, if anything, than
those to whom athletic success
comes naturally. The exhibition
this afternoon, while no doubt done
in a spirit of mere fun, was cer
tainly an example deserving of con
demnation and which might, if fol
lowed, lead to serious results in all
branches of student activity.
