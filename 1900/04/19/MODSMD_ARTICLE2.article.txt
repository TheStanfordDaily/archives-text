# Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
Baseball practice last night was
slow and uninteresting from the
bleachers. The Varsity and the
second team played four innings of
listless ball, the Varsity winning
out by a score of 9 to 3. Lanagan
pitched for the first team but did
not let himself out. He let the
second team hit the ball to give
the men behind him practice. The
Varsity hit well. They punched
out the ball for long, clean drives.
After the game Dr. Murphy put
the team in the field for fielding
practice, and at times the men did
first-class work. Just to show,
however, that they had not forgot
ten how to make errors, at times
they would go all to pieces on

ground and fiy halls, and throw
the hall around the diamond like
a lot of sailors.
The change in the infield of
Strohn from third to second and
Brown in Strohn's old position on
third has livened up the work
around the middle part of the dia
mond. Edwards works better with
Strohn. He seems to have gained
confidence by working with Clare.
It seems a safe prediction that he
will settle down and get back into
the pace he set early in the season.
Second base is Strohn's old home
and he plays the position with his
usual dash.
The out-field is somewhat dis
organized at present. Murphy is
only doing light work on account
of an injured knee, and Symonds
is getting in shape for the broad
jump, cutting baseball out this
week. Cowden, the only one of
the fielders left, gathered in every
thing that came his way. Hamp
son and "Dilldock" played the
other fields.
More men on the second team
should come out. Last night's
practice was hampered consider
ably because the second team had
but eight men out, and it was
necessary to shift a man from the
Varsity to out-field for the second
team.
