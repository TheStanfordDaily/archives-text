# Ball Game on the 28th.
## 
### 
Manager Haslacher was seen to
day in regard to the question of
having the final baseball game and
the Intercollegiate debate on the
same day. He said that the base
ball game would undoubtedly be
played on April 28th, as the ex
pense of keeping the team in train
ing another week would be too great
to warrant a postponement. There
is a possibility that the game may
be played in San Jose instead of in
San Francisco. As the debaters
will in all probability be unwilling
to lose a week's preparation on the
chance of the baseball game being
held in the city, it is likely that
the two events will come off as now
scheduled, the game on the 28th
and the debate May sth.
