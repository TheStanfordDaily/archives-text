# Ready for the Meet.

### 
The final work on the track was
done last night and there will be
no more active training before the
intercollegiate meet next Saturday.
The men are now in uniformly
good condition and, on the whole,
may be counted on to be in the
best of form when they meet Berke
ley. A number of try-outs have
been held during the past week to
give the captain and coach some
sort of an idea of what our team
can be depended upon to do.
The changes which the California
management desired made in the
field have been completed and the
oval is in very good condition for
fast work.
