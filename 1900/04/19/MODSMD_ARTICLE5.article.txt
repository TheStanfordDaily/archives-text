Saturday at twelve o'clock the
special train to accommodate the
field-day crowd leaves Third and
Townsend streets, arriving on the
campus at 1:30 p.m. in time for
the beginning of the events at 2.
The round-trip excursion rate is
one dollar, and tickets returning
to the city are good on the 6:08

train in addition to the special
which leaves after the concert.
From San Jose a round-trip rate
has been given for seventy-five
cents, and a considerable crowd is
expected to come from there. The
field-day has been well advertised
in San Jose, Santa Clara, San
Mateo, Redwood City, Menlo Park,
and the surrounding country.
