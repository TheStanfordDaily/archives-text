# Saturday's Concert.

### 
The concert to be given in the
assembly hall Saturday evening,
April 21st, by the combined musi
cal clubs of Berkeley, promises to
be a great success. The glee,
mandolin and banjo clubs of Ber
keley are really splendid organiza
tions and have been training hard
in order to make a good showing
here at Stanford. This will be the
first opportunity of judging of the
excellence of our own musical or
ganizations, affording us a com
parison with those of the Univer
sity of California.
Besides the musical numbers
there will be specialties by "Brick"
Morse and Schwartz and Tully,
who have made such a hit with the
Berkeley Clubs and more recently
at the California students' recent
week's entertainment at the Orand
Opera House in San Francisco.
Reserved seats were placed on
sale today and a good advance
sale was made, so that a large
crowd is assured. Seats will be on
sale all day tomorrow at the post
oflice on the campus and the Pal
ace Pharmacy at Palo Alto.
