# FIELD-DAY TOMORROW.
## Final Arrangements Completed for the Ninth Annual Intercollegiate Track Meet. 
### 
All arrangements have been com
pleted for the Intercollegiate Field-
Day to be held on the oval tomorrow
afternoon. The Weather Bureau
predicts showers, but the manage
ment declares that the events will
be run off without fail unless a
deluge prevents.
The baseball bleachers have been
placed in position along the straight
away, and high board fences at
either end will keep the crowd from
encroaching on the cinder-path.
The track has been rolled into tine
shape, but will be somewhat slow
on account of the recent rains.
In regard to the condition of the
men, Dr. Murphy says:"The few
men who have been hampered in
training by injuries are now in rea
sonably good shape, and will be
able at least to enter their sched
uled events. The other men are
all fit, and barring accidents will
make the best showing of which
they are capable.
The officials who will have charge
of the meet are as follows : Starter,
Phil. Wand ; judges at finish, Dr.
Richardson, Robert Hancock, E.
W. Smith, '99, and a Berkeley man
