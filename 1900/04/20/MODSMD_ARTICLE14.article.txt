There was a tendency in the
student body meeting yesterday to
deride and make light of the Ath
letic Committee, a committee under

the present constitution which has
considerable power, and to which
it should be an honor to belong.
During the past year it has done
very valuable work and its firm
stand and concerted action brought
about the new era of campus games
and a revival of athletic spirit here.
Its pjain instructions to Stanford's
intercollegiate athletic representa
tives, its wise selection and its un
faltering backing of them brought
the field-day here and gained tri
umph for intercollegiate athletics
on the Coast that can be only
measured in the years to come. Yet
on this year's committee the men
who took an active part were few
in number, and of sixteen, only
four attended every meeting, three
of them ea'-officio members not elect
ed to the committeeâ€”the president,
secretary, and track manager. The
other was the track captain. Four
regularly voted members attended
no meetings, and several attended
but one during the year. At yes
terday's nominations nine names
were placed for this committee,one
was withdrawn, and one man, un
opposed for baseball manager, be
comes ex-officio a member of the
committee, leaving but seven names
when the constitution requires
eight at-large from the student
body. It seems a shame that such
an honor should go begging, and it
augurs ill for Stanford's supremacy
in athletics when so little interest
is taken in the committee that
backs our interests and dictates
our policy.
