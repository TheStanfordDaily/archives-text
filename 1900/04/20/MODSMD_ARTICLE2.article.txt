# Tennis Tomorrow Morning.
## 
### 
The intercollegiate tennis tour
nament will start tomorrow morn
ing at 9 o'clock sharp on the courts
of the California Tennis Club, on
the corner of Scott and Bush streets,
San Francisco. It has been defin
itely decided that Roth will play in
the singles. Tennis critics have
picked Roth of Stanford and Sum
ner Hardy of Berkeley as the win
ners of the singles, and seem to
think it is a toss-up who will win
the doubles. Hardy and Weihe,
however, should pull that match
and the tournament for Stanford.
