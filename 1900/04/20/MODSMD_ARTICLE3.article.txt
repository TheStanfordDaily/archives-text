# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
Last night's practice was an im
provement on that of the night be
fore. The play was livelier and
not so many flagrant errors were
made. The batting of the Varsity,
however, fell off noticeably when
Dr. Murphy went into the box. lie
had no difficulty in fanning the
heavy bitters by getting them to
go after bad ones. At bat the men
are too anxious to kill the ball and
do not keep their eyes open for
good ones, but bite at balls wide of
the plate and over their heads.
Work between the bags lacks
ginger. The base-runners and the
catchers do not go into this part of
the game with enough zest and
energy. They are not awake to the
chances. Brown has improved in
his fielding but he has got to do
some hard work before he will be
able to play third in Varsity form.
He has the ability to play rattling
ball and when the newness of his
job wears off he can be booked to
do some clever work. Edwards was
a bit erratic in last night's practice
but showed improvement. At first
Havens put up anything but a
creditable exhibition. At the be
ginning of the practice he worked
well but toward the end he got
tired and played like the first-base
man of the Podunk Alerts. Strohn
and Lougheed put up their usual
game.
Cowden did some first-class field
ing Murphy was out and did
i light work. .Next week the prac
tice will settle down to something
more serious. This week Dr. Mur

phy has been compelled to devote
most of his attention to putting a
finish on the work of the track
men.
