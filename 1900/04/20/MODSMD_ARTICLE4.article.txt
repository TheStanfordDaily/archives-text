# Athletic Agreement Adopted.
## 
### 
The athletic agreement between
tiie University of California and
Stanford University has at last
been finally passed upon, and the
agreement is now ready for the sig
natures of the members of the in
tercollegiate athletic com mit tee and
the president and secretary of each
student body.
This agreement would have been
ready to go into effect several weeks
ago had it not been for the fact
that the representatives of the As
sociated Students of the University
of California decided that it was
not a sufficiently model agreement.
Acting upon this impulse they in
serted a clause making the prohibi
tions of eastern coaches after 1900
apply to baseball as well as foot
ball. They then signed the docu
ment and sent it here for the
signature of the Stanford repre
sentatives.
Of course the Stanford commit
tee saw no reason why such a clause
should be considered when it had
not been passed in joint committee,
so they refused to sign this agree
ment. To relieve the deadlock the
Berkeley committee, who now had
been very much opposed in their
action in this matter by their base
ball element, decided that it was
not to have eastern coaches in base
ball after all. So the trouble is all
over, and after a long, hard session,
and after months of pro and con*
the weighty document which is to
guide us in onr intercollegiate diplo
macy is ready to start on its five
years' run.
