# The 						Berkeley Concert.
## 
### 
Whether the field-day is held
under favorable conditions or not
it is certain that the concert in the
evening by the California musical
clubs will be, and those who at
tend will have the pleasure of hear
ing a versatile program. The Stan
ford clubs have the reputation
everywhere of giving a high-class
musical entertainment in perfect
form, the mandolin and gleeclubs
having all the polish of eastern
clubs. The Berkeley clubs have
been carefully trained in this re
spect, but have also made an es
pecial attempt to bring into prom
inence the popular features of their
entertainment. The Stanford clubs
rest their reputation solely upon
musical merit; the Berkeley clubs
are proud of the fact that they are
entertainers, and for this reason
emphasize the specialty features
which are light and humorous, re
lieving the monotony of a cut and
dried glee and mandolin entertain
ment.
The concert tomorrow evening is
under the auspices of the Stanford
clubs and one-half of the proceeds
goes toward paying their debt to
the Associated Students. Reserved
seats are fifty cents, general admis
sion thirty-live cents.
