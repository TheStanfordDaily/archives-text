# NINTH FIELD-DAY.
## Stanford Loses in a Game on the Campus Oval. 
### 
W'itli an oval soggy from recent
rains, and a cold north wind stiffen:
ing the runners' muscles and heat
ing in their faces, Stanford lost the
Ninth Intercollegiate Field-day Sat
urday by a score of 84 to 33. The
talent had ceded to the Cardinal
more points than it actually won,
hut, as usual, the talent were at
fault. Stanford made a game fight,
and although the odds were heavy
against tliem, her athletes man
aged to surprise in a few particu
lars even their most ardent sup
porters, and to till the Berkeley
heart with chagrin at the sight of
their vaunted men of muscle going
down before the wearers of the car
dinal.
The only points at which the
Stanford supporters were disap
pointed were where old and tried
men, victims of the cold weather,
foreign to our campus, yielded their
rightful places to the striped-shirted
Berkeley men.
The facilities for handling the
crowd were fully equal to the guar
antees of our management, and
the success in this respect is added
proof of the wisdom of campus
games. Twelve hundred people
filled the bleachers and lined the
straightaway. And no difficulty
was experienced in caring for the
crowd which came over from Berke
ley in a special train, seven hun
<l red strong.
The first event of the day, and
the prettiest content from the spec
tators' point of view, was the 100-
yard dash. The first heat was won
by McCaughern of Stanford, with
Cadogan and Broughton trailing
behind. In the next heat Drum
reached the finish first, with Harter
of Stanford second, and Stewart
third. The time of both heats was
10:2-5 seconds, and it looked like
McCaughern against Drum for the
final, with California predicting an
easy victory for their man. But
the surprise of the day came when
McCaughern beat out Drum at the
tape in the final, winning by a close
margin in 10:2-5 seconds.
Drum regained some of his lost
prestige by winning the 220 yard
and 440 yard dashes. McCaughern
in the former race came in third,
and in the latter Smith fought his
man to the tape and made second.
In the line of surprises the mile
run came nigh eclipsing every
thing else. Hamilton, after trail-1
ing his opponents for three laps
and a half, sprinted by them in
the finish, and left Mosher to rustle
for second place The time was
5.01 1-5, which is fast work consid-j
ering the high wind.
One more surprise was in store j
for Berkeley. Hoffman, who is j
credited with beating the Coast I
pole-vault in practice, failed en-!
tirely to scale the bar at 10 feet 6
and was easily beaten by Boyd.
NVardall was supposed to have a
cinch on second place in the ham
mer throw, but he repeatedly
fouled by stepping out of the ring,
not being able to make a place.'
Brooke, who also failed to reach
his practice record, was third, i
I'law's throw was 148 feet 94 inches.

which beats Robert Kdgren's rec
ord by a dozen feet. Plaw also
broke the record in the shot put,
with 41 feet inches. Parker of
Stanford was third.
