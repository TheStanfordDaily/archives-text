It skems almost incredible that
the University of California nth-|
let ic management should eounte-|
nance such an attack on our exclu
sion from participation in the'
lield-dav of the runner whose name
was not on the list of eligible men
exchanged, as recently appeared in
the editorial columns of \hv Daily \
Culijoruian. Either the ineniorv
of the writer of that article is not!
long enough to recall the incidents;
of the last freshman football game,
or he lacks entirely the faculty of
recognizing his partisans'charac-'
teristic when displayed by an op-!
ponent. We deprecate very much
the necessity for retaliation, but]
any complaint against it from aj
Berkeley authority certainly comes
from a very unjustifiable source. |
As a. matter of fact, several days'
notice that one man would not be i
allowed to participate on account
of a technicality does not compare
with putting out two men for the
same cause at the very moment a
contest is to begin. Stanford has
this year, more, even, than ever be-!
fore, stood for pure college athlet- !
ics, and any attempt to point out i
this action without stating its piece- '
dent colnes with very bad grace in-j
deed.
