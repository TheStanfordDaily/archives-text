# Final Game in San Jose.
## 
### 
Manager Uaslacher of the base
ball team and Manager Belcher of
California's team had a conference
in San Francisco last Friday after
noon and decided to hold the final
game of the baseball series in San
Jose on next Saturday. This is
the first time since '96 that a cham
pionship game has been played in
San Jose. The Garden City is a
good baseball town and always
gives the colleges a large crowd.
Captain Strohn went to San
Jose Saturday morning to com
plete arrangements with the local
management to have everything
put in readiness for the crowd and
to have the field in good condition
for the game.
Efforts are being made to have
a special train leave the campus on
Saturday afternoon at 1:30 and
return immediately after the game.
If a train can be obtained an ex
cursion rate will be given to stu
dents. The announcement of
special train will be made later in
the week.
