# STANFORD WINS TENNIS
## Berkeley Team Clearly Outclassed in the Intercollegiate Tournament. 
### 
Stanford University again won
the annual intercollegiate tennis
tournament Saturday morning on
the courts of the California Tennis
Club, San Francisco. Though it
had rained the evening before, the
morning gave fii.e tennis weather,
it being cool, with no wind stirring,
The three Stanford players clearly
outclassed their opponents, and
could probably have carried oft all
three matches had it been neces
sary to do so. As it was, Roth had
already defeated Bra wley before the
last set between the Hardy broth
ers, and Sam saved himself, at the
expense of his brother, for the
doubles, which were the last of the
matches.
All the Stanford men played good
tennis, showing that we have men
who will assure us success in that
branch of athletics for some time
to come. Roth, '03, easily had the
best of his singles with Brawley,
while Hardy, '02, and Weihe, '03,
made a much stronger team than
Sumner Hardy and Hunt.
Sumner Hardy defeated his
brother in the first set of singles,
though the latter had the best of
it until Roth had defeated Braw
ley. The score was 6-4, 5-7, 6-0.
The second singles was won by
Roth over Brawley by a score of
7-5, 6-4. The match was even,
but the Stanford man proved the
stronger.
The doubles was a walkaway for
our team. Hardy and Weihe
buried their opponents with their
driving and team work. The score
was 6-1, 6-2.
