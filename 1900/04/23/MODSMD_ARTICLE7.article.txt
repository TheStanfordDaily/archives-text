# Berkeley Clubs' Concert.
## 
### 
One of the largest audiences ever
assembled at Stanford greeted the
Berkeley musical club's in the as
sembly hall Saturday evening. It
was an appreciative and enthusi
astic audience and the visiting en
tertainers were given a warm re

ception. The entertainment was
largely of a popular order, and at
no time was interest in the pro
gram allowed to liag.
The Glee, consisting on this oc
casion of twenty-one men, is marred
by no objectionable voices. The
club shows good technical training.
It sings well but there is a feeling
that while the mechanics of the
inu.-ic have been thoroughly mas
tered,something in sympathetic and
intelligent interpretation has been
lost.
The Mandolin Club's se
lections were in no way ambitious
or difficult, but were played with
delicacy and smoothness.
Banjo music is always infectious
and as played by the U. C. club
was thoroughly enjoyable. The
fact that these pieces also were
simple did not render them less
pleasing The classic of the pro
gram was the trio by loheim, Kns
tfer, and Goodenow. These men
showed a skill in execution and a
power of expression seldom seen
in amateurs. Otto Wedemeyer, '98,
who is a veteran on the U. G. club,
has a pleasing baritone voice, and
an excellent stage presence. His
work was much enjoyed, especially
his encore, which was well chosen.
The fun of the evening was fur
nished by Messrs. Tully, Schwartz,
and Harris, besides some lesser
"stars" who did service in the
" rough house sextette." The com
edy numbers for the most part can
be pretty accurately described as
" turns." They savored strongly of
current Pacific Coast vaudeville,
but tliey kept the large house in
the best of humor, and everybody
was pleased. Schwartz did his work
well. His first number, a diflicult
monologue, was given with much
skill, and was one of t he best things
of the evening, and his encores
served to increase his popularity.
Harris sang a song and kept up a
rapid fire of jokes, old and new, in
terspersed with the regulation gags
at the audience to â€¢' hurry up" and
"get off in a bunch." "it was a
good vaudeville " stunt," and every
body laughed and wanted more.
Tul ly's encore about the schoolboy
has been for generations a fixture
in college song books, but Dr. Jor
dan's "establishment" generously
applauded the adapted words.
