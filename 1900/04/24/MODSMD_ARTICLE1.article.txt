# VARSITY BRACING UP.
## 
### 
Last Night's Practice Shows Some
tiling of an Improvement in the
Recent Work of the Men.
A decided brace was noticed in
last night's baseball practice. The
Varsity with Lanagan in the box
had no trouble in swamping the
second team, the first team being
aided by two aerial exhibitions on
the part of the scrub. ''Doc''
Murphy and Swindells were the
battery against the Varsity.
In the fifth inning the second
scored two. runs, the only ones the}'
made. Swindells led off with a
hit. Coach Murphy hit a hot one
to Strolin, who let it go through
him. Swindells and "Doc" were
safe. Brown fumbled Horn's easy
ground hit and threw wild at first;
in the fireworks Swindells and
Murphy scored.
All during the game the Varsity
bunched their hits, scoring more
earned runs than runs off errors.
Havens, Cowden, and Brown got
three hits apiece. Two of Havens'
smashes were for two bags and one
for three liases. Cowden got, a
timely two-bagger with two men on
bases.
in the fielding game the play
was much better than anything
witnessed up to date. The seven
errors credited against the Varsity
is a total much too large for a
seven innings game, especially when
most of the slips were made on
easy chances and were largely due
to the old habit of taking things
easy in the praetice
The work of the infield has picked
up around first and second. Ha
vens played the bag in good form
last night. Strolin and Kd wards
each made an error. They work
well around second in taking care
of thrown balls. Brown was the
chief offender last night. He had
two costly runs out of six chances.
The out field escaped without a ma rk
in the error column.
