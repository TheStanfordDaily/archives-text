Ttik students, while exercising j
their privilege of University citi-j
zenship at the polls tomorrow, will
at the same time be given an op
portunity to voluntarily show their j
appreciation of thf greater Ameri-â– 
can citizenship. Lt is only a small
contribution asked from each, but j
all added together will erect a
memorial to our volunteers which
will remain an object of pride as
long as the University lives, and
whose origin will become oneof our I
community traditions. There is'
no need of predicting that every j
one of us will add to the memorial j
fund as we cast our ballots to- j
morrow something which will en-!
title us in later years to claim hi
share in the honor of its erection.
