# Baseball Excursion.
## 
### 
Arrangements have been made
with ihe railroad company for an
excursion train from the campus
for the final intercollegiate baseball
game in San Jose next Saturday.
A round trip rate of sixty-five cents
will be offered, the train leaving
the campus at 1:15 and Palo Alto
at 1:80, and returning will leave
immediately after the game.
As it is the intention of the Berke
ley management to obtain an ex
cursion of supporting rooters from
across the bay, a large crowd was
guaranteed the company from here
in order to induce the low rate.
The team is thoroughly satisfied
with the San Jose grounds, and all
that is needed to insure every
chance of our success is a large at
tendance from the University.
