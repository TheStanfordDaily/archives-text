The Executive Committee yester
day ordered Treasurer Leiler to
sign a forma 1 contract for the con
struction and placing of the mem
orial plate to be dedicated to our
students who served in the Span
ish-American war. Bv the very
intention of this monument it
should be erected as the direct gift
of the students, and the Executive
Committee have believed that bet
ter than a draft on our treasury
would be the plan of raising mon
ey by voluntary offering. A gen
eral assessment might be levied,
but this would be apart from the
purpose.
Most every student cherishes
deep sentiment of respect for the
self sacrifice wbieh the plate will
symbolize, and it is to the gener
osity of all who share such senti
ment that appeal is made. All
these are asked to bring twenty-five
or fifty cents, or whatever sum
they feel able to contribute, to the
polling place on Wednesday, thus
participating in the gift to their
comrades.
