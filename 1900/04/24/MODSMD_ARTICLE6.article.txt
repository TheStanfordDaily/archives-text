# SERVICES IN THE CHAPEL
## The 						Newly Installed Pastor of the First Unitarian Church Delivers the Sunday Sermon. 
### 
Rev. Bradford Leavitt of San
Francisco delivered ilie regular ad
dress in tlie chapel Sunday morn
ing, choosing two lexis: "J'm come
I hat ye might have life and that ye
might have it more abundantly,"
and " Whosoever will, let him take
of the water of 11 fe freely."
" I'he most important thing in
the world," (lie speaker said, "is
life. The most interesting thing is
life. The thing most sought for is
life. If you go out into the fields
on a height sunny day you see all
nature teeming with life; grass,
the trees, the rocks, and the water;
; everything is filled with living or
ganisms. Go to the great snow
I fields of the \lpsor of Greenland.
1 If you know where to look you will
' tiinl plenty of life; insects, birds,
i and animals living happily where
| man cannot exit-t. Life iH the
j thing most sought after. All things,
so the scientist tells us, began troni
! a common source. We do not know
when the first living cell appeared;
, we only know, 'in the beginning,
God.' In all ages since that first
beginning, life has been reaching
lout and struggling upwards. At
I the top of the ladder stands man.
i What man needs is life, not longer
life but more life. 'All of life that
j is worth living,' so a great preacher
lias told us, ' is not offered to man
in a lifetime, but possibly in a.
day.'
The great teacher tells us that
his purpose" wns nr—girT* life, and
in that other verse lie gives the con
dition of this offer,'whosoever will.'
; Now what sort of life did .Jesus
I come to give? It used to be thought,
I and some people hold the opinion
still, that this life was something
different and apart from our pres
ent existence; that baptism or join
i ing the church gave a man a new
kind of life not of much use in this
I world, but all important in the
j next. All this has undergone a
change. We know that heaven
and hell are not places but rather
states of mind and that a man can
never reach any higher heaven
than he reaches by himself.
"'Whosover will,' that is the
only condition Jesus ever made. A
man must will to have life before it
is given to him. The Israelites un-1
derstood this, for Moses said when 1
he came down from Sinai, ' Will
you have Jehovah for your God, or
will you worship idols.' God has
not changed his methods in this
later day, and if we wish life we
must will to have it.
"Some say, 'Let me do as I please, i
Why should 1 trouble myself with
the future? Is not God omni
potent? What kind of a God is it
that cannot save everyone and
anyone?' No! an omnipotent God
cannot contradict his own nature
which is truth. Can God himself
give virtue? No! for virtue is the
free choice to do right, made by a
will which is not coerced. There is
an institution near New York con
taining two thousand men. These
men are never drunk; there is
neither stealing, fight ing,nor swear-'
ing. It is the state's prison at

Sing Sing. Would you call these
men virtuous? No! there in no
salvation beyond the limits of
character.
" Hut suppose a man does not
feel thirsty for the waters of life;
does not want it, says ho is satis
fied with himself und his existence.
I his man is a Pharisee. Christ
could look with composure upon
, all weakness except this. IJesays
again and ' Woe unto ye
Pharisees.' And the Pharisees are
not all dead.
I* inally, 1 care not to what
church a man may belong. Creed
never saved an}' one. If he hon
estly believes in some one (hint!
he is on the right track. When you
reach heaven you will m»t find the
gates closed and St. Pet< r theie to
j ask you your creed, hut you will
' find them wide open and over them
written, ' Whosoever will, let him
enter.'"
