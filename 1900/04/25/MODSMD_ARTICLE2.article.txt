In a four inning game the Var
sity defeated the Second team by a]
score of 5 to 2 in the practice game
last night. The play throughout
was slow and lacked ginger, due
perhaps to the cold wind which
swept across the diamond.
In the preliminary warm-up the
Varsity put up fast, snappy ball,
but after the game began they fell
off in the play, and in four innings
had four errors. The Second team
was good in streaks. Parker on
third took away the honors for the
infield. Following is the score :
