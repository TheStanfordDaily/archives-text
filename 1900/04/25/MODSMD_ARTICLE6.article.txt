# LITERARY RECITAL.
## Lee Emerson Bassett and Horatio Cogswell Present an Enjoyable Program in the Chapel. 
### 
The recital last night tendered
by Mr. Lee Bassett, assisted by Mr.
Cogswell, should be a matter of
satisfaction to these gentlemen, to
their audience, and to the Univer
sity. A student venturing to en
tertain his fellow students usually
suffers the disadvantage of not car
rying the prestige that strangers
have, while he finds compensation
in being judged only by local
standards. Last night, however,
the audience was ver}' appreciative,
nor would Mr. Bassett need feel
ashamed at comparison .with severe
standards. Nearly all the readings
were worth the hearing for them
selves, as pieces of literature, and
they were selected because they of
fered themselves for interpretation
rather than opportunities for tricks
of elocution.
Mr. Bassett deserves the praise
of taking his work seriously. He
combines with good artistic sense
and feeling a desire for scholarly
appreciation. In other words, he
strives to be a scholar turned elo
cutionist. The reading of the grave
yard scene from Hamlet well illus
trated Mr. Bassett's idea. In place
of coarse buffoonery so often attrib
uted to the grave diggers and so
dear to the groundlings, Bassett
endeavored to give to the setting
that tinge of grimness and deep
humor that the real critic saw when
he pronounced this scene the great
est sermon on the vanity of lnrtnan
existence. Intent on preserving the
proper mood, Mr. Bassett sometimes
over-emphasizes it. His grave dig
gers would have been better if they
had been livelier, and there was
too much scorn in <l For a' that."
Nevertheless, Mr. Bassett is on the
right path, and it would be inter
esting it we could see this young
man a dozen years from now, in the
full development of his art
Mr. Cogswell, who has a sweet
and sympathetic voice, sang with
delicacy and precision. He re
sponded with an encore to each of
his numbers. Miss Hurl hurt ac
companied and played well several
rather difficult accompaniments.
