# THE 						NEW REGISTER.
## Synopsis of the Catalogue for the Current Year, Which Will Soon Be Issued. 
### 
The University Register for 1899-
1900 in at last in print, and will be
ready for distribution in a few days.
In general appearance it does not
differ materially from previous Reg
isters. It is, however, printed on a
little heavier paper, and with the
twenty-six additional pages is per
ceptibly more bulky in size. The
promotions in the faculty and new
appointments which it records have
already been noted in the Palo
Alto. It is interesting to note,
however, that the number of teach
ers has increased from 107 in 1898—
99 to 121.
The division of the Register here
tofore called "Admission and Grad
uation " has been divided into three
general heads,'• Admission," " Resi
dence," and "Graduation." The
general statement regarding admis
sion has been rewritten. An in
teresting addition is the statement
at the top of page 32 that " in spe
cial eases subjects not included in
the entrance list, such as the me
chanical drawing and shopwork
of manual training and polytech
nic schools, may be offered for en
trance if pursued in a manner and
to an extent satisfactory to the Uni
versity." This provision is in
tended to meet the needs of such
schools.as the California School of
Mechanical Arts, whose four years'
course would otherwise fall short of
preparation for admission to the
University.
Two important additions have
been made in the provisions for
admission on recommendation (pa
ges 44 and 45). So many supple
mentary tests are now required that
even recommended graduates of the
best schools have been unable to
feel sure of admission to the Uni
versity until the examination week
was over. These supplementary
tests are required in English Com
position, English Literature, Phys
ics, Chemistry, Physiology, Motany,
Zoology, Drawing, History, French,
German, and Latin and Greek
Prose Composition.
It is now provided that a candi
date presenting acceptable recom
mendations in the full number of
entrance subjects required may be
assured of admission to the Uni
versity notwithstanding various
supplementary tests which must be
met. This will take away the feel
ing of worry on the part of the
prospective student without in any
way lowering the standard in any
individual subject. In the interest
also of a uniform statement of en
trance requirements, towards which
all the larger universities are now
working, it is provided that, "A
candidate fulfilling all requirements
for admission in full standing to
Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Cornell,
Johns Hopkins, Chicago, or groups
I and II of California, will be given
provisional undergraduate stand
ing without further tests."
Under " Residence" the new reg
ulations regarding outside work,
"University credit for special
courses" is given, as well as the
modified rule regarding advanced
standing from other institutions.

Two other provisions will be noted:
First, that study cards not filed
within the ten days permitted at
the beginning of each semester will
be accepted only upon payment of
an additional fee of $2 ; and sec
ond, that studies taken but not
registered in any semester through
oversight or carelessness may be
registered at a later time only upon
payment of a fee of $2 in each
course.
Under " Graduation," notice of
the new professional degree of Bach
elor of Laws appears for the first
time.
There are the usual variations in
the announcement of courses of in
struction. The department of Phi
losophy appears for the first time
in its independent role, and eleven
courses are outlined. The depart
ment of Law has been entirely re
written, and the relation of the de
partment to the University very
clearly stated. The conditions un
der which graduates may take
courses in Law have been elabor
ated and carefully stated, and the
amount of such professional studies
which can count toward the Bache
lor's degree has been limited to
thirty hours. A full three years'
course in Law is outlined, one year
of which is to be included in the
work of Law majors for the Bacca
laureate degree. The remaining
two years are to be taken as grad
uate work, and will lead to the pro
fessional degree of Bachelor of
Laws.
The University Library is given
the distinction of a general head
ing, and follows Courses of Instruc
tion. The course in Bigliography
is included in the library announce
ment.
Under Debates and Prize Con
tests, the special Cosmopolitan Es
say and the Stallard Essay are
noted, as well as the Intercollegiate
and Carnot Debates.
Under University Associations is
included the new Philosophy Club,
with a list of the papers presented
during the current year.
The general summary of students
is presented below. The total reg
istration for the year is 1331, an
increase of 178 over the registra
tions for 1898-99.

The University Register for 1899-
1900 in at last in print, and will be
ready for distribution in a few days.
In general appearance it does not
differ materially from previous Reg
isters. It is, however, printed on a
little heavier paper, and with the
twenty-six additional pages is per
ceptibly more bulky in size. The
promotions in the faculty and new
appointments which it records have
already been noted in the Palo
Alto. It is interesting to note,
however, that the number of teach
ers has increased from 107 in 1898—
99 to 121.
The division of the Register here
tofore called "Admission and Grad
uation " has been divided into three
general heads,'• Admission," " Resi
dence," and "Graduation." The
general statement regarding admis
sion has been rewritten. An in
teresting addition is the statement
at the top of page 32 that " in spe
cial eases subjects not included in
the entrance list, such as the me
chanical drawing and shopwork
of manual training and polytech
nic schools, may be offered for en
trance if pursued in a manner and
to an extent satisfactory to the Uni
versity." This provision is in
tended to meet the needs of such
schools.as the California School of
Mechanical Arts, whose four years'
course would otherwise fall short of
preparation for admission to the
University.
Two important additions have
been made in the provisions for
admission on recommendation (pa
ges 44 and 45). So many supple
mentary tests are now required that
even recommended graduates of the
best schools have been unable to
feel sure of admission to the Uni
versity until the examination week
was over. These supplementary
tests are required in English Com
position, English Literature, Phys
ics, Chemistry, Physiology, Motany,
Zoology, Drawing, History, French,
German, and Latin and Greek
Prose Composition.
It is now provided that a candi
date presenting acceptable recom
mendations in the full number of
entrance subjects required may be
assured of admission to the Uni
versity notwithstanding various
supplementary tests which must be
met. This will take away the feel
ing of worry on the part of the
prospective student without in any
way lowering the standard in any
individual subject. In the interest
also of a uniform statement of en
trance requirements, towards which
all the larger universities are now
working, it is provided that, "A
candidate fulfilling all requirements
for admission in full standing to
Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Cornell,
Johns Hopkins, Chicago, or groups
I and II of California, will be given
provisional undergraduate stand
ing without further tests."
Under " Residence" the new reg
ulations regarding outside work,
"University credit for special
courses" is given, as well as the
modified rule regarding advanced
standing from other institutions.

Two other provisions will be noted:
First, that study cards not filed
within the ten days permitted at
the beginning of each semester will
be accepted only upon payment of
an additional fee of $2 ; and sec
ond, that studies taken but not
registered in any semester through
oversight or carelessness may be
registered at a later time only upon
payment of a fee of $2 in each
course.
Under " Graduation," notice of
the new professional degree of Bach
elor of Laws appears for the first
time.
There are the usual variations in
the announcement of courses of in
struction. The department of Phi
losophy appears for the first time
in its independent role, and eleven
courses are outlined. The depart
ment of Law has been entirely re
written, and the relation of the de
partment to the University very
clearly stated. The conditions un
der which graduates may take
courses in Law have been elabor
ated and carefully stated, and the
amount of such professional studies
which can count toward the Bache
lor's degree has been limited to
thirty hours. A full three years'
course in Law is outlined, one year
of which is to be included in the
work of Law majors for the Bacca
laureate degree. The remaining
two years are to be taken as grad
uate work, and will lead to the pro
fessional degree of Bachelor of
Laws.
The University Library is given
the distinction of a general head
ing, and follows Courses of Instruc
tion. The course in Bigliography
is included in the library announce
ment.
Under Debates and Prize Con
tests, the special Cosmopolitan Es
say and the Stallard Essay are
noted, as well as the Intercollegiate
and Carnot Debates.
Under University Associations is
included the new Philosophy Club,
with a list of the papers presented
during the current year.
The general summary of students
is presented below. The total reg
istration for the year is 1331, an
increase of 178 over the registra
tions for 1898-99.
