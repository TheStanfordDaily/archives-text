The election yesterday dem
onstrated that our voting system
is not yet perfect in every detail.
It wasnoticeable after the counting
was concluded that a number of
the ballots which had been counted
were taken for souvenirs, unknown
to the election officers. This should
not have been permitted, but was
probably unavoidable under the
circumstances. Our regulations
provide that all ballots cast shall
be preserved, so that they shall be
available if a recount is found de
sirable. It is quite impossible to
accomplish this without being more
careful than we have been in the
past. We suggest that every bal
lot be "strung" as soon as counted.
