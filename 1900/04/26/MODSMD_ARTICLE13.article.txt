The firm stand of our baseball
management, demanding that the
third game of the baseball series
should be played in Son Jose in
stead of on our own campus, is de
serving of much praise. The Berke
ley management agreed to play at
San Jose and then, when all the
necessary arrangements had been
made for the game, the California
management insisted on playing on
our own campus. They are willing
to give us the apparent advantage
of our own grounds rather than
play in San Jose. While Berke
ley's offer has all the appearance
of magnanimity and generosity, yet
what assurance has the Stanford
management that in return for two
games on our campus this year,
Berkeley will not demand the same

tiling for themselves next season?
It is simply a matter of principle
with us and we must see that the
agreement entered into earlier in
the season shall be carried out. It
is either San .Jose or no game, and
as lo the latter, there is no douht
that Bei keley will play next Saiur
