BALDWIN'S
Health Tablets.
A most valuable scientific and thorough
ly reliable remedy in all forms of consti
pation, dyspepsia, intestinal fermentation
and sluggishness of the liver.
Medical statistics conclusively prove
that at least 90 per cent of the American
people axe afflicted with some faulty ac
tion of the secretory glands of the stom
ach, intestines or liver. Thoughtful people
do not use calomel, blue mass, or griping
cathartics for constipation in this en
lightened age.
The new remedy, Baldwin's Health Tab
lets, is a 'true Liver Tonic and gentle
laxative, hence a positive cure for consti
pation, biliousness, dyspepsia, siclthead-
KJhe, dizziness, eitc. The most obstinate
cases yield to these small tablets.
R W. Tansill, the Chicago millionaire
cigar man (of Tansill's Punch 5c cigar
fame), says:
"Baldwin's Health Tablets are the best
remedy for constipation, biliousness and
torpid liver I have ever used."
Serjeant Frank I>e Vere of Battery K,
Third Artillery, Regular Army, U. S. A.,
says:"I pained twenty-five pounds on my
Hast trip to Manila, and not a day of sick
ness, by using- Baldwin's Health Tabletsâ€”
the best remedy for constipation I ever
used. They repulaitethe bowels and make
a man feel good." Tablets cost 26 cent*.
Send a 2-cent stamp to the R. L. BaJd

manual for self treatment.
Baldwin'* Remedies are sold by
