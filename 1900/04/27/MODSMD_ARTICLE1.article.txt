# STANFORD VERSUS BERKELEY.
## Deciding Game Tomorrow at San Jose. Both Teams in Fine Fettle. 
### 
Tomorrow the Varsity will go to
San Jose to play the deciding game
of the intercollegiate championship
series for '00. A large crowd of
rooters will follow the team to cheer
them on to victory. For the first
time in two years it looks as if the
Cardinal will come out victorious
over the Blue and Gold. The teams
are very evenly matched, however,
and the Varsity will need all the
support the large crowd can give
them.
On form our team has a shade
the best of Berkeley in the pitching
department and at hat, but in field
ing we are considerably below the
standard set by the Californians.
With the exception of the lirst in
ning of the second game, they have
put up a much better game in the
Held than our men. In the prac
tice games of the past week, how
ever, the Varsity has picked up
litty per cent in their fielding game,
and ought to play as well as Berke
ley in this department of the game
tomorrow. If they do field as well
as U. C., our advantage in the box
and at the bat should win the game
for us.
For the last week the men have
played with more ginger than at
any time during the season. They
are all in the game from the time
the first ball is pitched until the
umpire calls the third man out in
the ninth. The outfield is wink
ing well together and covering their
territory in good shape. The infield
is putting up a fine article of ball
They have their eyes on ground
balls, and their throwing is sharp
and accurate. Strohn and Ed
wards cover the ground around
second in varsity form. The shift
ing of Strohn has had a good effect
all through the infield. It has
braced up Edwards and Havens,
and has put Brown on the bag he
is best suited for The batting is
on edge. Lanagan and Lougheed
are both in fine fettle.
On form, judged from the records
of the games up to date, we should
win tomorrow's game bv a comfort
able margin ; but form in practice
games is no criterion to judge what
a team will do when under fire in
a big game, as our experience of
the first contest of this year has
taught us. NVfe are sure, however,
that the men are going in to do
their best, and their best is good
enough to bring back the cham
pionship that we need.
