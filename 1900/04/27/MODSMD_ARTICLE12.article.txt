The institution of an annual
track meet with Nevada would be
a most welcome addition to our list
of athletic events. That university
has always had a warm feeling of
common sentiment with Stanford,
and a regular meet with them
would do much to strengthen the
acquaintance between the two. We
hope the track meet announced for
a week from Saturday will be the
beginning of a new intercollegiate
event.
