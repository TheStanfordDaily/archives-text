Stanford will have no reason
to complain in the event of ill suc
cess tomorrow if the excursion train
from the campus is not packed to
its capacity. The game, under the
circumstances, is perhaps the most
important intercollegiate event of
the year to us. The management
has exerted itself to its utmost to
obtain every inducement for a large
crowd to go down and there is no
reason why we should not respond.
The team will need all the support
we are capable of giving them, for
a large crowd of opposing rooters is
sure to attend from across the bay.
Let every one in the University
who has not the best of excuses for
not doing so, attend, and we will
have no cause to regret the outcome
of the intercollegiate series.
