# Senior Farce.
## 
### 
The work of selecting a farce to
be presented under the auspices of
the Senior Class is progressing fa
vorably. The twenty-five dollar
prize offered for the best play caused
lively competition, four farces of va
rying degrees of merit having been
submitted to the committee in
charge of the selection. Two of
these have already been read and it
is expected that a decision will be
reached by next Monday. As soon
as the play is decided upon, tlx*
cast will be chosen and rehearsals
will probably be begun by next
Thursday at the latest.
