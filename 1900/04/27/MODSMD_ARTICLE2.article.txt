A dinner was given this evening
to l)r. Murphy, the baseball coach,
who leaves early in the week for
New York. A number of friends
who have clubbed together around
the same table during the last, year
planned the affair, which was a sur
prise to the doctor. During the
course of the evening the guest of
honor was presented with a hand
some stein, engraved with the
names of the friends who were
present at dinner.
