### 
Those who are fortunate enough
to spend Commencement- Week at
Stanford this year will be repaid
hy an enjovahle entertainment
which 1900 is preparing to give
them and which promises to rival
any of its predecessors since'9s.
The festivities will open Thursday
evening, May 241h, when the Senior
Class will give a reception and
dance in Fncina Hall. Yanke's
orchestra Â«>f San Francisco will
furnish music for the occasion, and
judging from the result of this in
novation last year by the Class of
'99, it will be one of the most pleas
it lit feat ures of t h<' week.
Friday evening the Senior Farce
will be given in the assembly hull.
The class will endeavor to make
this one of the best theatrical pro
ductions yet submitted to a. Stan
ford audience.
On Saturday an entertainment
will be given through the courtesy

of the C*lee and Mandolin Clubs.
This has always been one of the
most attractive events of the Senior
Week program, and ihe success of
our clubs ibis year leads us to an
ticipate a pleasant evening with
them.
Ihe Baccalaureate Sermon will
be delivered Sunday, May 27th,
by Dr. Horatio Stebbins.
On Monday the (Jlass Day exer
cises and plate dedication will oc
cupy the morning, and in the even
ing Ihe Senior ball will take place
in lidicina club room. The music
for this dance also will be fur
nished by Yanke's orchestra, and
Yanke is arranging an exception
ally good program, which will be
announced later. No efforts will
be spared by the committee to ren
der the Senior Ball as usual the
da nee of t he yea r.
As last year, the promenade will
take place Tuesday evening, and it
will undoubtedly offer a number of
pleasant surprises to those who at
tended the "proms" of the last two
years. In illumination and decora
tion the Century class hopes to of
fer some suggestions to its friends
which, combined with music by
Yanke's band of twenty-five pieces
and a number of attractive booths,
should make the evening a very
pleasant affair.
Commencement Week will end
Wednesday with the exercises at
10:80 a.tn. in the assembly hall, at
which time 117 students will lie
presented with diplomas.
There will lie other features of
the week not yet announced, such
as the Faculty-Senior baseball
game, when the Seniors appear in
fancy costumes and meet, the Fac
ulty team on the diamond.
