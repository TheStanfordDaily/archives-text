# BERKELEY WINS THE SERIES.
## Stanford Loses the Third Game at San Jose by a Score of 10 to 5. 
### 
The Varsity baseball team, cer
tain of victory, and backed by a
special train full of enthusiastic
rooters, went down to San Jose Sat
urday to meet the nine of the Uni
versity of California in the game
that would decide the championship
of the year. When the last man
was out the score stood 10 to 5 in
favor of the Blue and Gold. Berke
ley won, not because she played
winning ball, but because our men
failed utterly to cotne up to their
own and their supporters' expecta
tions.
The attendance was about 800,
composed mostly of Stanford sym
pathizers. The score was :

SUMMARY.
Baseson balls —Kaarsburg I,Lan
agan 9. Two-base hits —Lougheed,
Havens, Kaarsburg. Three-base
hit —Kaarsburg. Struck out —By
Lanagan 4, by Kaarsburg7. Passed
balls —Lougheed 3, Smith 1. Wild
pitches —Lanagan 2.
Time of game, 1:45. Umpire,
O'Connell. Scorers, Cameron and
Earle.

The game was in many respects a
reversal of the game in which Cali
fornia was defeated two weeks ago.
In both cases it was the first inning
that decided the score. The six
runs that Berkeley got before the
first three men were out gave her a
lead impossible to overcome.
The Stanford rooters were dum
founded at the very outset when
they saw Lanagan, who all through
the season has been the mainstay
of the team, futilely endeavoring to
put a ball over the plate. Bases on
balls were the order of the inning,
with a few hits and errors thrown
in for variety. A couple of muffs,
a wild throw over third, and three
donated tallies from Lanagan gave
Berkeley six runs before the fire
works were ended. In our half
Strohn had batted a pretty home
run,so thescore stood (> to 1. From
now on the game went our way.

The Stanford delegation rallied
grandly to their team's support,
and completely drowned out the
feeble Berkeley slogan. But Lana
gan, although he steadied down
somewhat, could not he depended
on, and hailed six more batters to
first before the game was ended.
Kaarsburg throughout pitched a
steady, mechanical game, giving
but one base on balls and allowing
few hits. Stanford showed its old
weakness at the bat, and repeatedly
lost chances of winning the game
after all by inability to gauge
Kaarsburg's slow curves. In the
eighth inning, with two men out
and three on bases, Lougheed came
to bat, and for a moment the root
ers took heart again, for a hit would
make things even, but Lougheed
knocked only an easy grounder,
and was caught on first. In the
ninth neither side made a run, and
the game closed with Berkeley five
runs in the lead.

The game was in many respects a
reversal of the game in which Cali
fornia was defeated two weeks ago.
In both cases it was the first inning
that decided the score. The six
runs that Berkeley got before the
first three men were out gave her a
lead impossible to overcome.
The Stanford rooters were dum
founded at the very outset when
they saw Lanagan, who all through
the season has been the mainstay
of the team, futilely endeavoring to
put a ball over the plate. Bases on
balls were the order of the inning,
with a few hits and errors thrown
in for variety. A couple of muffs,
a wild throw over third, and three
donated tallies from Lanagan gave
Berkeley six runs before the fire
works were ended. In our half
Strohn had batted a pretty home
run,so thescore stood (> to 1. From
now on the game went our way.

The Stanford delegation rallied
grandly to their team's support,
and completely drowned out the
feeble Berkeley slogan. But Lana
gan, although he steadied down
somewhat, could not he depended
on, and hailed six more batters to
first before the game was ended.
Kaarsburg throughout pitched a
steady, mechanical game, giving
but one base on balls and allowing
few hits. Stanford showed its old
weakness at the bat, and repeatedly
lost chances of winning the game
after all by inability to gauge
Kaarsburg's slow curves. In the
eighth inning, with two men out
and three on bases, Lougheed came
to bat, and for a moment the root
ers took heart again, for a hit would
make things even, but Lougheed
knocked only an easy grounder,
and was caught on first. In the
ninth neither side made a run, and
the game closed with Berkeley five
runs in the lead.
