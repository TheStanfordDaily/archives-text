That Stanford was disappointed
in the showing made by the base
ball team Saturday there is no de
nying. We were more than that,
we were dissatisfied. Had they
been beaten by superior playing on
the part of their opponents, there
would have been no less praise for
them than had they won. To be
defeated by our own poor playing,
however, is the defeat in which it
is hardest to find consolation. Our
only point of satisfaction is that
victory in such a poorly played
game as was Saturday's does not
bring the credit of a well earned
one. We are all ready to admit
our opponents' superiority, but the
grade of both is what causes us re
gret. Though the baseball season has
not turned out as we had hopes and
expectations that it might, we have
none the less honor for those who
have conscientiously worked for our
success. There have been those
also who have not been as conscien
tious as they might, and for these
we cannot say there is the same
feeling. We only look forward to
some time when the sentiment
against abuses of training rules
will become strong enough here a I

Stanford to insure a penalty to of
fenders, and then such abuses will
cease. When that time comes the
annual complaints about careless
training in spring athletics will
come t»» an end, and, whether we
win or lope, there will he onlv that
sentiment of having done our la si
which is so characteristic of the
aftermath of the football season.
