The following letter was recently
received from Prof. 1). S. Kimball
of the department of Machine De
sign at Cornell University. Pro
fessor Kimball is a graduate of
Stanford University, Class of ".)(>,
and of the department of Mechan
ical Engineering.
Prof. A. W. Smith.
My dear Sir: 1 enclose a letter
which 1 have just .received from a
former shopmate who has, by great
effort, got. enough money together
to take an engineering -course in
lome university. He has had con
siderable practical experience and,
no doubt, if he is prepared properly,
a course in engineering would
greatly benefit him. 1 have sent
him to you, not only because you
can advise him correctly, but also
because I think he can do as well
and better at Stanford than he can
by going farther from home.
There is no reason why students
should go away from the Coast, at
least for the first three years' work.
As far as the theoretical courses are
concerned, those at Stanford are
planned the best of any I know,
and the instruction in them is of
the highest grade I know of no
such able body of engineering
teachers as the one under which 1
had the privilege of receiving my
college training. The various courses
fit in with one other better than any 1
know, and the reason is not hard
to see. In nearly all the en
gineering courses of the older uni
versities many growths have taken
root that are hard to eradicate,
though they are not always for the
best interests of the institution. At
Stanford all was laid out new by
men who already had experience
with such aforesaid growths, and
who knew the remedy. Students
there do not receive the same thing
in several departments, but are able
to do the maximum of work with a
minimum expenditure of time,
which is a great advantage. There
are a great many points about the
Stanford engineering courses that
some institutions would do well to
copy.
I am looking forward to the time
when you will have your shops and
your laboratories, and can make
your whole system complete. It
seems to me that such an outfit
would do more for Stanford than
anything else. With a good labora
tory and machine shop, and the
present courses of instruction, there
would no doubt be a rapid increase
in the number of students.
Considering the way that engi
neering has been handicapped at
Stanford, the results already ob
tained are remarkable, and indicate
in a measure what could be accom
plished if the present courses of in
struction could be supplemented by
courses in well equipped labora
tories.
