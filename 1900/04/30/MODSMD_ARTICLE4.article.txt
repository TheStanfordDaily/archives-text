# Senior Farce Chosen.
## 
### 
The competition for the twenty
five dollar prize offered for the heat
farce for the Senior theatricals was
cloned Saturday after four farces
had been submitted. The success
ful competitor was J. S. Briscoe,
ex-'OO, author of last year's Junior
farce. The play submitted is a rol
licking burlesque, entitled "To
Have and to Lose, or In Patagonia,"
and is something entirely new in
the line of college farces. The scene
is laid at Stanford, where two pro
fessors interested in science set out
for Patagonia on a collecting trip
and find themselves in a vacant lot
near Mayfield.
Other farces were submitted by
K. Ilobson, Miss Mildred Stanford,
'01, and Fletcher B. Wagner, '03.
