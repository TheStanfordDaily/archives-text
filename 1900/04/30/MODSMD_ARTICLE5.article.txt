# SUCCESSFUL BENEFIT.
## Enjoyable Entertainment Saturday Evening for the Aid of the Students' Guild. 
### 
The feature of the entertainment
Saturday night was Professor Hud
son's farce, "The Red Vampire." J
The farce had for its theme the
troubles of one George Carstairs.
About three minutes after the farce
began, that gentleman appeared on
the stage in a difficulty, and with
every step from one foot to the
other, he kept working himself
deeper into the quicksands until
within three minutes of the end of
the play, when he was rescued by
the strong hand of the Red Vam
pire. This piling up of difficulties
was a remarkable piece of work and
consumed practically all the time
of the farce. As soon as an ex
planation of the difficulties was
suggested, the play closed without
the addition of any fifth explana
tory or marriage act. The farce was
a bit of pure fun, and moved from
beginning to end with such dash
and spontaneity as to permit of not
the least suspicion of "chewed pen
cil" in its composition.
To name the best actors would
be but to name over the cast, which
was small and selected with careful
reference to parts. All did work of
high amateur order. The best joke
of the evening was the one on the
audience, and perhaps the most
realistic acting was done by the
man who played the role of the de
faulting Cadwallader Jones.
This farce, written by one of the
professors in the English depart
ment, may mean more than an
evening's nonsense and entertain
ment. There has been a criticism
of English departments that their
students learn so much about pro
prieties that they are afraid to risk
any sort of production. And the
unbending to experiment, even in
the writing of a farce, may embolden
others to some sort of venture.
The Girls' Glee Club, though a
little weak in contralto parts, sang
delightfully. It is a loss to our
musical interests that this club does
not appear oftener. The Varsity
Glee Club, by a happy combina
tion of ill-preparation and careless
ness, succeeded in doing its poor
est. The Varsity Mandolin Club
rendered well some of their old fa
miliar numbers. Improvement was
shown by the Orchestra. While
this organization may not be said
to play well, every member de
serves special commendation for un
dertaking a difficult task, and it is
hoped that this club may become a
permanent feature of college life.
The Girls' Mandolin Club made
such a picturesque effect in their
tasty gowns that there was no dis
position on the part of the audience
to let them leave the stage.
Taken altogether the entertain
ment was an eminent success by
reason of the size and appreciation
of the audience as well as the va
riety and interest of the program.
The proceeds of the evening are to
be given to the Students' Guild and
used for furnishing the women's
sitting-room.
