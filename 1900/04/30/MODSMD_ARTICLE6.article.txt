The 1901 Annual will be placed

011 sale 011 the quadrangle tomorrow
morning. This is the seventh vol
ume of the Quad series, and and its
managers claim that it is the best.
Many innovations will he noticed
in its pages. There are half-tone
cuts of "Our Journalists," of the'o3
football team, the '01 track team,
Girls' Glee, Girls' Mandolin Club,
athletic captains, managers,coaches,
and many other groups, in addition
to the regular football, society, de
bating, track, and glee pictures.
The art work is of a strikingly
original order. Hardly a page of
the book is without pictures of some
sort. The '01 Class history is fully
illustrated, and the lists of student
volunteers, Encina officers, Zoology
Club lecturers, musical clubs, etc.,
are cleverly interspersed with
sketches.
The "josh" department is gotten
up on lines entirely different from
those of former Annuals. Besides
the regular take-offs on students in
illustration and quotation, the fac
ulty and the co-eds receive liberal
attention.
The arrangement of the book it
self is a new idea, and the style of
paper, type, and binding will be
unique. The volume is larger by
over thirty pages than the last
Quad. The price is $1.50.
