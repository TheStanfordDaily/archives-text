a dancing platform, hung overhead
with lines of dangling Japanese
lanterns, where a large party of
dancers enjoyed themselves. Lie

spacious dining-room as well as on
the lawn.
After receiving in the house, Mrs.

with native songs, and furnished
dance music for the dancers, who

At six o'clock the reception ended,
