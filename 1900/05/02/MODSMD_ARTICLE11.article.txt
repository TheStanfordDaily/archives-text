The action of the Athletic Com
mittee in disqualifying the mem
bers of the track team who tied
for third place in the pole-vault
and high-jump seems to be an un
just ruling against the men who
did all they could to win a point
for Stanford, but on the whole the
committee is justified in its course.
If the competitors had jumped off
the tie, the winner would be rightly
entitled to his sweater ; but when
these men let the event hold over
with the hope that all who tied
would get sweaters, they acted in
an unsportsmanlike manner, which
should not escape unnoticed.
