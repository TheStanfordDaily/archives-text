It seems that University stu
dents would be too far advanced in
respectability to indulge among
themselves in the deliberate petty
thefts which often characterize the
assembling of large crowds. The
complaints made about the ex
change of such trifles as hats and
gloves at yesterday's reception, how
ever, go to prove the contrary. The
loss of these articles does not amount
to much to individuals, and may
be ascribed to mistake in some in
stances. But when the trouble be
comes as wholesale as was the case
yesterday, it shows a deliberate in
tention which cannot be excused.
Where there are outsiders we might
feel inclined toward questioning
our own guilt; but this was an
assemblage exclusively of students,
and there can be no shifting of the
responsibility. In fact, the freedom
given us yesterday looks little more
than a satisfaction that it would
not be abused. We are glad the
burden of these exchanges rests
upon ourselves, although it would
be much more pleasant to be as
sured that gatherings of Stanford
students would not be subject to
these inconveniences as are those
more public. We would suggest a

return of all articles not rightly
held to the Registrar's office, with
an explanation that they were taken
by mistake, and, if we are given an
opportunity to attend such affairs
in the future, the exercise of more
care against mistakes.
