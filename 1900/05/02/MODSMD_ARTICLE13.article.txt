The appearanck of the Quad
without many of the group pictures
which have characterized it in the
past confirms the fear that the de
termination of the management in
that regard would prove a step
backward instead of an improve
ment. This applies .particularly to
the fraternity groups. If they have
been omitted merely to follow the
precedent of eastern universities,
we do not believe the omission is
justified. It certainly is not if it
has been a matter of expense. In
the face of the financial success of
last year's publication, the action
of the management in this regard
seems a sacrifice of the interests of
the book and Stanford's literary
reputation to a personal greed for
an increased revenue. One of the
pleasing additions to the book,
which makes even more noticeable
its omissions, is the group of Encina
Club. That illustrative idea of lo
cal characteristics, if carried out
everywhere, would certainly have
given a result much superior to
that attained, as a publication rep
resentative of the UDiversity, and,
we take it, that is the object of an
annual. We sincerely hope this
year's departure from former prece
dent, in regard to group pictures
will not be followed in the future.
It will, we believe, remain a mark
in the development of Stanford
Quads of the parsimony of but one
management.
