# Sweater Question Decided.
## 
### 
The Athletic Committee met in
room 11 quad at 1:15 today. Those
present were J. H. Coverley, E. M.
Davis, Bristow Adams, L. S. Har
ter, H. S. Boyd, Charles Cantwell.
After some discussion it was moved
b}' Boyd that none of the men who
tied for third place be awarded
Varsity sweaters ; seconded by
Davis, and carried. The reason for
this decision is that it would not
now be a fair test if the contested
place was tried out as the men have
been, out of training over two weeks.
Moreover, it would greatly cheapen
the Varsity sweater if given for one
third of a point.
