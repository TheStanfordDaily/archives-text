# 1901 "QUAD" APPEARS.
## This Year's Annual a Literary and Financial Success and Well Received. 
### 
Interest for the past two days lias
centered in the 1901 Quad, which
was received from the publishers
Tuesday morning. The book has
sold better than any previous num
ber, and hence, whatever else may
be said of it, is a financial success.
As to the literary and artistic side,
opinions differ, as they inevit
ably do in such cases. The un
joshed may feel insignificant be
cause they failed to make the (}uad,
and the joshed feel notorious be
cause they have ; but all must ac
knowledge that the book is one that
the Stanford man can show to his
friends with an easy conscience.
The cover is not as substantial,
either in appearance or fact, as it
might have been, but the lack there
is made up by the paper within.
This is a high grade of rough white,
deckled edge, and lends a modern
up-to-date tone to the book, which
is enhanced by the correctness of
the typographical details.
The arrangement of the subject
matter in departments is a good
one, and there seems to be more of
it than in former annuals. The
feature of the book that is most
criticised is the omission of frater
nity pictures, and in their place the
insertion of plates. The matter is
largely one of taste, and the pro
and con can both find precedents.
The majority of eastern colleges no
longer print fraternity pictures, but
they have always been a feature of
Stanford annuals, and many stu
dents miss the opportunity of com
parison which the cuts from year
to year afford.
The art work this year is cer
tainly very creditably done and
conservatively arranged.
Full-page illustrations are rare,
but what there are of them are
choice. Initial and illuminated
letters are used to advantage
wherever possible. The page half
tones are only average, some print
ing badly and others fairly well..
One of the most unique and attrac
tive things in the book are the
half-tone Stanford views sprinkled
through the pages. These are some
thing new, and meet with universal
approbation.
The literary department is up to
standard. Verse predominates, as
perhaps is right, as better verse is
written here than prose. Varsity
publications, clubs, and organiza
tions find greater prominence this
year than formerly, which tends to
make the book more representative.
The josh department is well man
aged, the illustrated alphabet and
coats-of-arms being new and pleas
ing features. The joshes are
stiffer than is usual with us, and
some had better been left out, but
for the most part they serve the
purpose for which they are pub
lished, being gentle satires which
only cut skin deep.
