# Mention of "Stanford Stories."
## 
### 
The New York Times in its Sat
urday Review says of the announce
ment of "Stanford Stories" :
" Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Smith, Vassar, and other eastern

seats of learning have already had
their romanticists, and nor Stan
ford University, California, is to
join the list. The book is discretely
called Tales of a Young Univer
sity.' It seems to have been the
feeling among undergraduatewriters
that a college must have consider
able of a past in order to furnish
material for serious fiction. Yet
who can deny that the life of a
young college has much to express?
For example, would not one's curi
osity be aroused by encountering a
book called 'Tales of Chicago Uni
versity,' or some similar title? "
Such a notice, coming from a
journal of the character of the New
York Times, would seem to indicate
that this book will be of no small
interest to college people in the
East.
Up to date, the subscription lists
for "Stanford Stories" have ad
vanced beyond the four hundred
mark here on Ihe campus, while a
large number has also been sub
scribed for by the alumni and for
mer students. The book will be on
sale before college closes. The ad
vance sheets are expected to arrive
next week. C. M. Bradley, '01, and
Sam Hardy, '02, will take subscrip
tions.
