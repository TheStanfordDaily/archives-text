Editor Daily Palo Alto :
In your issue of Wednesday, May
2d, I find in the editorial on the re
fusal of the Athletic Committee to
give sweaters to any of those men
who tied for third places in the
field-day the statement that "when
these men let the event hold over
with the hope that all who tied
would get sweaters, they acted in
an unsportsmanlike manner, which
should not escape unnoticed." This
is an unfair and unwarranted state
ment.
The fact of the matter is that
nothing was said as to jumping off
the tie on field-day, and after that
date there was some doubt as to
what was to be done. There was
no precedent by which the matter
could be settled,and the only thing
to be done was to wait for the ac
tion of the Athletic Committee.
After a long delay six members of
the committee, three of whom were
ex-ofiicio, met ; of these one did
not vote. There was but one vote,
namely, to give none of those men
tying for third places sweaters.
This action seems unconstitutional,
for the ruling is that each man who
makes a point shall have a sweater,
and it seems out of the power of

the Athletic Committee to say that
for two third places no sweaters
shall be jiiven
There was much talk about les
sening the dignity of the varsity
" S," etc. How much more should
a man who plays for the last two
minutes of a football game deserve
a sweater? Jf the committee re
members, too, there was a man here
two years ago who got a sweater
without ever winning a place in an
intercollegiate event.
Finally, and above all, we object
to being termed "unsportsmanlike"
simply because the president failed
to call a meeting of the Athletic
Committee to discuss this matter
sooner, and we also object to the
action of three members out of six
teen in so interpreting the athletic
rulings of the past and saying that
no sweaters should be given for the
winners of two places in an inter
collegiate field-day.
