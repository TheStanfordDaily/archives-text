In the intercollegiate debate
we have one last chance of this year
to show what we can do in compe
tition with our rivals from Berke
ley. During the past two years we
have met them in contest after con
test, and the result is, we are cha
grined to have to admit, that our
showing has been anything but sat
isfactory from the standpoint of the
victories won. So unsatisfactory
indeed is that result that we have
been made to realize something
which we were at least prone to re
alize early in the year, â€”that inter
collegiate contests are serious mat
ters. We have taken them as jokes
in many instances, but the laugh
has been on us. It is high time
that we appreciate their importance.
We cannot do so sooner than at
this instant, and we cannot show
our change of feeling at a time |
when it will be more opportune
than at the debate on Saturday
night. And when we do this we!
must not assume the air of mar
tyrs. We must do it because we
love Stanford, and because it makes j
us better men and women to fight I
for our alma mater. We must also !
realize that the effect upon our rep-1
resentatives of our presence at a
contest is considerably overesti- 1
mated. The effect is directly upon
us, and in so far as it gives us a;
stronger hold on the true Stanford
spirit, it helps our teams to win
victories. Numerical strength and
plenty of noise are not the things 1
that carry any one through a strug
gle successfully ; they are but par
tial evidence of it. if we nre to
win, we must do so with our hearts,
and if we are to be of any help on
Saturday night, we must be there
because we want to, and not because
we think it our duty. Our team
has worked faithfully, and they ate
able debaters. They will do their
very best. Their subject is the

I most important one now before the
American nation. Let every loyal
Stanford man and woman who re
ally wants them to be victorious be
present to help them bear the out
come of their efforts, be it the de
cision or defeat.
