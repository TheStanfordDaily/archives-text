# ARRANGEMENTS PERFECTED.
## Everything in Readiness for the Debate to Be Held in San Francisco Tomorrow Night. 
### 
All arrangements are completed
for the Intercollegiate Debate, which
is to take place tomorrow night at
Metropolitan Hall, San Francisco.
The attendance promises to be large.
L. B. Wickersham and F. W. Ait
ken, the sub-committee on arrange
ments, have charge of the seating
accommodations. As on previous
occasions, the Stanford section will
be on the right side of the hall,
both upstairs and down, while
Berkeley will be seated on the left.
The doors will be open at seven
o'clock, and seats in the Stanford
section will be reserved for Stanford
students until a quarter of eight.
A section on the main floor near
the front of the auditorium will be
roped off and reserved for the root
ers. The presiding officer is still
in doubt. Dr. Jordan will not be
able to preside, and Dr. Duniway
may act in his place.
The question to be discussed, as
announced before, is : "Resolved.
That the guarantees of the Consti
tution should extend to all persons
and territory under the permanent
control of the United States, except
to persons living in tribal rela
tions." The phrase, " the guaran
tees of the Constitution " is under
stood to mean not only the securities
for personal liberty, but also the
provision of the Constitution which
says, " that all duties, imposts, and
excises shall be uniform throughout
the United States." The Berkeley
speakers are to be : W. M. Martin,
winner of the last Carnot medal,
F. E. Borton, and 0. H. Hotle, with
W. B. Greeley as alternate.
Our team needs little introduc
tion, for their work on the last in
tercollegiate forensic contest is well
known. They are able speakers
and representative students, and
will do all within their power to
bring home a Stanford victory.
