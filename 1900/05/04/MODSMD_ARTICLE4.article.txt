Time was when we sent our fresh
man and scrub teams to Reno to a
certain victory over the University
of Nevada. It has been in the
past an easy matter for our teams
to defeat athletes gathered from
only one hundred and fifty stu
dents. But last fall their football
team scored against the Varsity on
our own grounds, and that with the
encouragement of but a handful of
collegians. Tomorrow the team
which lost to '03 by four points
will meet our track team on the cam
pus oval. Whenever the men from
Stanford have gone to Nevada they
have received the most courteous
treatment. Tomorrow we will be
the hosts, and, if merely as an ex
change of courtesies, the bleachers
should be well filled, to show our
appreciation of the generous treat
ment and sportsmanlike conduct of
the Nevadans toward us in the
past.
