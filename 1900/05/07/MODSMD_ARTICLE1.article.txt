Never in the history of Pacific
Coast intercollegiate contests has
an event fraught with deeper
significance occurred, than the
winning of the annual debate by
Stanford from the University of
California in San Francisco Sat
urday night. For the fourth time
nominally since the event was in
augurated, for the fifth time actu
ally, we have wrested forensic hon
ors from our opponents. The
croakers, if any there be, the proph
esiers of evil, the pessimistic mourn
ers of the "good old pioneer days,"
are relegated to the past, and hope
ful optimism prevails. In a field
which, after all, is perhaps the tru
est meeting-ground for the univer
sities, Stanford has won a victory
from the best debating team Berke
ley has ever sent out.
Three thousand people had
crowded into Metropolitan Temple
by 8 o'clock, the time set for the
opening of the debate. The Cardi
nal contingent of " rooters " occu
pied a roped-off section of the or
chestra chairs at the right of the
main aisle, while the balcony was
emblazoned with the blue and gold
streamers of California's support
ers. The latter outnumbered the
Stanford representatives three to
one, but the Palo Alto men had no
trouble in keeping up their end of
the chaffing that was bandied back
and forth, and kept the audience
in good humor until the speaking
commenced. Berkeley had just re
ceived the news of their team's de
feat at New Haven, and were feeling
rather glum in consequence, but
Stanford tendered all sorts of con
dolences, and magnanimously
wished them "better luck next
time" The audience was a thor
oughly representative one, and re
markable especially for the number
of lawyers in attendance, presum
ably in search of enlightenment for
themselves on a knotty constitu
tional question.
The Stanford debaters, who sat
at the right of the platform, were
John E. Springer, '00, Miss Anna
G. Fraser, '00, and Cecil M. Mar
rack, '01. For Berkeley, Fred E.
Borton,Owen E. Hotle, and Wiltsie
M. Martin. The judges were the
Hon. Erskine M. Ross, Hon. Thomas
P. Hawley, and Hon. J. A. Cooper
At a quarter past eight Dr. F. A.
Fetter of Stanford, happily chosen
presiding officer after some delay,
opened the exercises with an ex
planation of the question for de
bate, which was as follows: " Re
solved, That the guarantees of the
Constitution should extend to all
persons and territory under the
permanent control of the United
States, except to persons living in
tribal relations."
" The phrase, ' the guarantees of
the Constitution,'" said Professor
Fetter, "is understood to include
not only the securities for personal
liberty, but also the provision, ' but
all duties, imports, and excises shall

be uniform throughout the United
States.' 'fhe judges shall render
their decision on the merits of the
debate ; the merits of the question
shall not be considered save as they
are presented in the debate. Each
speaker will be allowed twenty
minutes, and the affirmative will
have ten minutes additional in
which to close." J. E. Springer
of Stanford was then introduced as
the leader for the affirmative.
Before entering upon his main
arguments, Springer defined the
question in hand, and set forth
clearly the plan of procedure which
he and his colleagues were to adopt.
"There are," he said, " two im
portant points about this debate.
First, we are not discussing the
question whether our new posses
sions should or should not be per
manently retained, —that has noth
ing to do with this debate. We are
discussing a principle applicable to
territory in general, and not to any
specific piece of territory. • If that
territory is retained, we say that
the principle should be applied to
all territory. Second, we are dis
cussing a general principle, and not
a specific case.
"The first proposition we wish to
lay down is that our position does
not involve giving the inhabitants
of the territories political privi
leges. We say that they should be
given personal and civil rights, but
not political privileges."
After elaborating this point at
length, and citing the Constitution
and various other high authorities
in its support, the speaker took up
his second proposition.
" We contend," he said, " that we
are squarely in line with the past;
that the principle we advocate has
the authority of the makers of the
Constitution, and of the Constitu
tion itself; that it has guided this
country in its past dealings with
territory, and that it has behind it
the weight of opinion in this coun
try, past and present. For our op
ponents to establish their case they
must show that the Constitution
should be changed."
Springer's third point was that
if the United States does not ex
tend the guarantees of the Consti
tution to our territory, she must
enter upon the un-American and
unconstitutional policy of imperial
ism.
.1. E. Borton, who was Berkeley's
first speaker, based his argument
on these three premises :
First —This Government can ac
quire territory not included within
the present limits of the United
States.
Second—ln legislating for terri
tory not so included, Congress is
not limited by the bounds of the
Constitution.
Third Whether or not such ter
ritory is within the jurisdiction of
United States, Congress is the sole
arbiter.
Miss Fraser, who followed for

Stanford, devoted a large part of
her time to a sharp and effective
rebuttal of her opponent's conten
tions, and completely won over
the audience by her enthusiasm.
She claimed that her side was the
more practical,resting upon the Con
stitution and tinctured with justice,
fair dealing, and expediency. She
said that the debaters on the nega
tive side were getting away from
the principles of liberty, equality,
and the true ideal and practical
manifestation of the Constitution.
"We of the affirmative contend,"
said she, "that fair dealing and ex
pediency alone demand the exten
sion of the rights we ourselves en
joy to the possessions which have
lately come to us. The question
concerns one of the most vital prin
ciples of our Government. Indeed,
outside of the constitutional and
simply depending upon the ground
of expediency, we can win our case.
A unified nation is the only nation
that can succeed. We want none
of the deceitful lying diplomacy of
European nations practiced in this
country. Any one who has read
Gen. Miles' proclamation to the
people of Porto Rico knows what
was promised, and we are in honor
bound to keep those promises."
California's second speaker, Owen
E. Hotle, is a very easy speaker
and naturally an orator, but he
missed his opportunities by falla
cious argumenjt, and was an easy
prey to the rebuttal of the affirma
tive.
Hotle had referred in a sarcastic
way to the "quaint little town of
Palo Alto," a characterization
which Marrack, the next speaker,
turned into a text for some clever
rebuttal.
"Although I was not aware that
the quaintoesd of I'alo had any
thing to do with the merits of this
question," he said, "I am fortun
ately able to agree with most of the
argument of the eloquent gentle
man who has jast taken his seat.
Most of his argument was devoted
to an effort to prove that Congress
has no power to extend the Consti
tution. That is just what my col
leagues have endeavored to prove.
We believe that Congress is the
creature of the Constitution and has
no power over it in any way. The
gentleman is injuring his cause in
thus upholding the integrity of the
Constitution.
"In opening his remarks, the first
speaker upon the negative said that
it would be necessary for us to prove
our case from a constitutional, mo
ral, and practical standpoint. The
second negative made the proud
claim that the Berkeley argument
advanced in steps. 1 think we shall
lie able to come to the gentleman's
standard by advancing in steps and
also meet the requirements of the
first negative, for the first speaker
upon the affirmative showed the
constitutional necessity of our posi
tion. My second colleague pointed
out its moral necessity in justice
both to ourselves and to the inhabi
tants of our new possessions. It is
my purpose to prove that the ex
tension of these guarantees is expe
dient. In doing so 1 shall endeavor
to prove two things: (1) That it is
expedient to extend the guarantees
for personal liberty to our new pos

sesions; and (2) That it is expedi
ent to have tariff uniformity be
tween tliis country and those pos
sessions.
"If njy effort to prove these two
points is successful, we shall have
won our case."
W. M. Martin, the winner of the
Carnot medal this year, closed for
California, putting forth a less able
argument than his effort of last Feb
ruary.
Springer, in his ten minutes' re
buttal, covered the entire field of
the debate in a speech which, for
concentrated force, has never been
surpassed in an intercollegiate de
bate. He rapidly reviewed the
whole case, both affirmative and
negative, clinched Stanford's posi
tion beyond question, and inciden
tally fired a few shots at Berkeley's
bulwarks that smashed them into
nothingness. California had con
tended that upon Stanford, as rep
resenting the affirmative, rested
the burden of proof, and that if the
negative could find a single flaw in
their opponent's program, they had
won the debate. Springer very
adroitly caused this assertion to
react against the negative by call
ing attention to the fact that it was
the negative, not the affirmative,
that was advocating a change of
policy, and that upon the Berkeley
debaters, therefore, rested the ne
cessity of proving what is called in
parliamentary usage a "universal
negative." In closing, the speaker
rapidly reviewed the arguments
presented, and left the decision to
the judges, who, after a short con
sultation, announced a majority
decision for the affirmative.
Afler the decision, pandemonium
reigned among the Stanford cohorts
for fully ten minutes, and then a
procession was formed, which
marched, singing and cheering,
down Market street to the Palace
Hotel, where three hoarse but vig
orous cheers were given for the
Cardinal and the team.
The news of the victory was re
ceived at Stanford a few minutes
after the decision was rendered, and
in a short while the members of
the student body went wild with
excitement and enthusiasm. Jn
less time than it takes to tell of it,
a monster bonfire was blazing in
the center of the diamond, and
cheering students were encircling
it in a mad dance. When the fire
burned low, as if by common im
pulse the whole crowd dispersed, to
return in a moment with boxes,
barrels, and any fuel it could lay
its hands on. When these were
exhausted another scamper took
place, and in a moment returned
bearing whole haycocks from the
surrounding fields. These soon
went up in sparks and smoke.
During this time the University
whistle was keeping up a continual
tooting, sometimes articulated into
the Stanford yell, and sometimes a
mere chaos of sound. It was a
long time before the tumult died
away, and it was revived in part
on the arrival of those who came
down on the one o'clock train. As
an expression of enthusiasm and
spirit, the whole affair was one of
the most noteworthy ever held on
the campus in honor of a Stanford
victory.

"In opening his remarks, the first

constitutional necessity of our posi

out its moral necessity in justice
both to ourselves and to the inhabi

W. M. Martin, the winner of the
Carnot medal this year, closed for
California, putting forth a less able
argument than his effort of last Feb
ruary.
Springer, in his ten minutes' re
buttal, covered the entire field of
the debate in a speech which, for
concentrated force, has never been
surpassed in an intercollegiate de
bate. He rapidly reviewed the
whole case, both affirmative and
negative, clinched Stanford's posi
tion beyond question, and inciden
tally fired a few shots at Berkeley's
bulwarks that smashed them into
nothingness. California had con
tended that upon Stanford, as rep
resenting the affirmative, rested
the burden of proof, and that if the
negative could find a single flaw in
their opponent's program, they had
won the debate. Springer very
adroitly caused this assertion to
react against the negative by call
ing attention to the fact that it was
the negative, not the affirmative,
that was advocating a change of
policy, and that upon the Berkeley
debaters, therefore, rested the ne
cessity of proving what is called in
parliamentary usage a "universal
negative." In closing, the speaker
rapidly reviewed the arguments
presented, and left the decision to
the judges, who, after a short con
sultation, announced a majority
decision for the affirmative.
Afler the decision, pandemonium
reigned among the Stanford cohorts
for fully ten minutes, and then a
procession was formed, which
marched, singing and cheering,
down Market street to the Palace
Hotel, where three hoarse but vig
orous cheers were given for the
Cardinal and the team.
The news of the victory was re
ceived at Stanford a few minutes
after the decision was rendered, and
in a short while the members of
the student body went wild with
excitement and enthusiasm. Jn
less time than it takes to tell of it,
a monster bonfire was blazing in
the center of the diamond, and
cheering students were encircling
it in a mad dance. When the fire
burned low, as if by common im
pulse the whole crowd dispersed, to
return in a moment with boxes,
barrels, and any fuel it could lay
its hands on. When these were
exhausted another scamper took
place, and in a moment returned
bearing whole haycocks from the
surrounding fields. These soon
went up in sparks and smoke.
During this time the University
whistle was keeping up a continual
tooting, sometimes articulated into
the Stanford yell, and sometimes a
mere chaos of sound. It was a
long time before the tumult died
away, and it was revived in part
on the arrival of those who came
down on the one o'clock train. As
an expression of enthusiasm and
spirit, the whole affair was one of
the most noteworthy ever held on
the campus in honor of a Stanford
victory.

Never in the history of Pacific
Coast intercollegiate contests has
an event fraught with deeper
significance occurred, than the
winning of the annual debate by
Stanford from the University of
California in San Francisco Sat
urday night. For the fourth time
nominally since the event was in
augurated, for the fifth time actu
ally, we have wrested forensic hon
ors from our opponents. The
croakers, if any there be, the proph
esiers of evil, the pessimistic mourn
ers of the "good old pioneer days,"
are relegated to the past, and hope
ful optimism prevails. In a field
which, after all, is perhaps the tru
est meeting-ground for the univer
sities, Stanford has won a victory
from the best debating team Berke
ley has ever sent out.
Three thousand people had
crowded into Metropolitan Temple
by 8 o'clock, the time set for the
opening of the debate. The Cardi
nal contingent of " rooters " occu
pied a roped-off section of the or
chestra chairs at the right of the
main aisle, while the balcony was
emblazoned with the blue and gold
streamers of California's support
ers. The latter outnumbered the
Stanford representatives three to
one, but the Palo Alto men had no
trouble in keeping up their end of
the chaffing that was bandied back
and forth, and kept the audience
in good humor until the speaking
commenced. Berkeley had just re
ceived the news of their team's de
feat at New Haven, and were feeling
rather glum in consequence, but
Stanford tendered all sorts of con
dolences, and magnanimously
wished them "better luck next
time" The audience was a thor
oughly representative one, and re
markable especially for the number
of lawyers in attendance, presum
ably in search of enlightenment for
themselves on a knotty constitu
tional question.
The Stanford debaters, who sat
at the right of the platform, were
John E. Springer, '00, Miss Anna
G. Fraser, '00, and Cecil M. Mar
rack, '01. For Berkeley, Fred E.
Borton,Owen E. Hotle, and Wiltsie
M. Martin. The judges were the
Hon. Erskine M. Ross, Hon. Thomas
P. Hawley, and Hon. J. A. Cooper
At a quarter past eight Dr. F. A.
Fetter of Stanford, happily chosen
presiding officer after some delay,
opened the exercises with an ex
planation of the question for de
bate, which was as follows: " Re
solved, That the guarantees of the
Constitution should extend to all
persons and territory under the
permanent control of the United
States, except to persons living in
tribal relations."
" The phrase, ' the guarantees of
the Constitution,'" said Professor
Fetter, "is understood to include
not only the securities for personal
liberty, but also the provision, ' but
all duties, imports, and excises shall

be uniform throughout the United
States.' 'fhe judges shall render
their decision on the merits of the
debate ; the merits of the question
shall not be considered save as they
are presented in the debate. Each
speaker will be allowed twenty
minutes, and the affirmative will
have ten minutes additional in
which to close." J. E. Springer
of Stanford was then introduced as
the leader for the affirmative.
Before entering upon his main
arguments, Springer defined the
question in hand, and set forth
clearly the plan of procedure which
he and his colleagues were to adopt.
"There are," he said, " two im
portant points about this debate.
First, we are not discussing the
question whether our new posses
sions should or should not be per
manently retained, —that has noth
ing to do with this debate. We are
discussing a principle applicable to
territory in general, and not to any
specific piece of territory. • If that
territory is retained, we say that
the principle should be applied to
all territory. Second, we are dis
cussing a general principle, and not
a specific case.
"The first proposition we wish to
lay down is that our position does
not involve giving the inhabitants
of the territories political privi
leges. We say that they should be
given personal and civil rights, but
not political privileges."
After elaborating this point at
length, and citing the Constitution
and various other high authorities
in its support, the speaker took up
his second proposition.
" We contend," he said, " that we
are squarely in line with the past;
that the principle we advocate has
the authority of the makers of the
Constitution, and of the Constitu
tion itself; that it has guided this
country in its past dealings with
territory, and that it has behind it
the weight of opinion in this coun
try, past and present. For our op
ponents to establish their case they
must show that the Constitution
should be changed."
Springer's third point was that
if the United States does not ex
tend the guarantees of the Consti
tution to our territory, she must
enter upon the un-American and
unconstitutional policy of imperial
ism.
.1. E. Borton, who was Berkeley's
first speaker, based his argument
on these three premises :
First —This Government can ac
quire territory not included within
the present limits of the United
States.
Second—ln legislating for terri
tory not so included, Congress is
not limited by the bounds of the
Constitution.
Third Whether or not such ter
ritory is within the jurisdiction of
United States, Congress is the sole
arbiter.
Miss Fraser, who followed for

Stanford, devoted a large part of
her time to a sharp and effective
rebuttal of her opponent's conten
tions, and completely won over
the audience by her enthusiasm.
She claimed that her side was the
more practical,resting upon the Con
stitution and tinctured with justice,
fair dealing, and expediency. She
said that the debaters on the nega
tive side were getting away from
the principles of liberty, equality,
and the true ideal and practical
manifestation of the Constitution.
"We of the affirmative contend,"
said she, "that fair dealing and ex
pediency alone demand the exten
sion of the rights we ourselves en
joy to the possessions which have
lately come to us. The question
concerns one of the most vital prin
ciples of our Government. Indeed,
outside of the constitutional and
simply depending upon the ground
of expediency, we can win our case.
A unified nation is the only nation
that can succeed. We want none
of the deceitful lying diplomacy of
European nations practiced in this
country. Any one who has read
Gen. Miles' proclamation to the
people of Porto Rico knows what
was promised, and we are in honor
bound to keep those promises."
California's second speaker, Owen
E. Hotle, is a very easy speaker
and naturally an orator, but he
missed his opportunities by falla
cious argumenjt, and was an easy
prey to the rebuttal of the affirma
tive.
Hotle had referred in a sarcastic
way to the "quaint little town of
Palo Alto," a characterization
which Marrack, the next speaker,
turned into a text for some clever
rebuttal.
"Although I was not aware that
the quaintoesd of I'alo had any
thing to do with the merits of this
question," he said, "I am fortun
ately able to agree with most of the
argument of the eloquent gentle
man who has jast taken his seat.
Most of his argument was devoted
to an effort to prove that Congress
has no power to extend the Consti
tution. That is just what my col
leagues have endeavored to prove.
We believe that Congress is the
creature of the Constitution and has
no power over it in any way. The
gentleman is injuring his cause in
thus upholding the integrity of the
Constitution.
"In opening his remarks, the first
speaker upon the negative said that

lay down is that our position does
not involve giving the inhabitants
of the territories political privi
leges. We say that they should be
given personal and civil rights, but
not political privileges."
After elaborating this point at
length, and citing the Constitution
and various other high authorities
in its support, the speaker took up
his second proposition.
" We contend," he said, " that we
are squarely in line with the past;
that the principle we advocate has
the authority of the makers of the
Constitution, and of the Constitu
tion itself; that it has guided this
country in its past dealings with
territory, and that it has behind it
the weight of opinion in this coun
try, past and present. For our op
ponents to establish their case they
must show that the Constitution
should be changed."
Springer's third point was that
if the United States does not ex
tend the guarantees of the Consti
tution to our territory, she must
enter upon the un-American and
unconstitutional policy of imperial
ism.
.1. E. Borton, who was Berkeley's
first speaker, based his argument
on these three premises :
First —This Government can ac
quire territory not included within
the present limits of the United
States.
Second—ln legislating for terri
tory not so included, Congress is
not limited by the bounds of the
Constitution.
Third Whether or not such ter
ritory is within the jurisdiction of
United States, Congress is the sole
arbiter.
Miss Fraser, who followed for

Stanford, devoted a large part of
her time to a sharp and effective
rebuttal of her opponent's conten
tions, and completely won over
the audience by her enthusiasm.
She claimed that her side was the
more practical,resting upon the Con
stitution and tinctured with justice,
fair dealing, and expediency. She
said that the debaters on the nega
tive side were getting away from
the principles of liberty, equality,
and the true ideal and practical
manifestation of the Constitution.
"We of the affirmative contend,"
said she, "that fair dealing and ex
pediency alone demand the exten
sion of the rights we ourselves en
joy to the possessions which have
lately come to us. The question
concerns one of the most vital prin
ciples of our Government. Indeed,
outside of the constitutional and
simply depending upon the ground
of expediency, we can win our case.
A unified nation is the only nation
that can succeed. We want none
of the deceitful lying diplomacy of
European nations practiced in this
country. Any one who has read
Gen. Miles' proclamation to the
people of Porto Rico knows what
was promised, and we are in honor
bound to keep those promises."
California's second speaker, Owen
E. Hotle, is a very easy speaker
and naturally an orator, but he
missed his opportunities by falla
cious argumenjt, and was an easy
prey to the rebuttal of the affirma
tive.
Hotle had referred in a sarcastic
way to the "quaint little town of
Palo Alto," a characterization
which Marrack, the next speaker,
turned into a text for some clever
rebuttal.
"Although I was not aware that
the quaintoesd of I'alo had any
thing to do with the merits of this
question," he said, "I am fortun
ately able to agree with most of the
argument of the eloquent gentle
man who has jast taken his seat.
Most of his argument was devoted
to an effort to prove that Congress
has no power to extend the Consti
tution. That is just what my col
leagues have endeavored to prove.
We believe that Congress is the
creature of the Constitution and has
no power over it in any way. The
gentleman is injuring his cause in
thus upholding the integrity of the
Constitution.
"In opening his remarks, the first
speaker upon the negative said that
it would be necessary for us to prove
our case from a constitutional, mo
ral, and practical standpoint. The
second negative made the proud
claim that the Berkeley argument
advanced in steps. 1 think we shall
lie able to come to the gentleman's
standard by advancing in steps and
also meet the requirements of the
first negative, for the first speaker
upon the affirmative showed the
constitutional necessity of our posi
tion. My second colleague pointed
out its moral necessity in justice
both to ourselves and to the inhabi
tants of our new possessions. It is
my purpose to prove that the ex
tension of these guarantees is expe
dient. In doing so 1 shall endeavor
to prove two things: (1) That it is
expedient to extend the guarantees
for personal liberty to our new pos

sesions; and (2) That it is expedi
ent to have tariff uniformity be
tween tliis country and those pos
sessions.
"If njy effort to prove these two
points is successful, we shall have
won our case."
W. M. Martin, the winner of the
Carnot medal this year, closed for
California, putting forth a less able
argument than his effort of last Feb
ruary.
Springer, in his ten minutes' re
buttal, covered the entire field of
the debate in a speech which, for
concentrated force, has never been
surpassed in an intercollegiate de
bate. He rapidly reviewed the
whole case, both affirmative and
negative, clinched Stanford's posi
tion beyond question, and inciden
tally fired a few shots at Berkeley's
bulwarks that smashed them into
nothingness. California had con
tended that upon Stanford, as rep
resenting the affirmative, rested
the burden of proof, and that if the
negative could find a single flaw in
their opponent's program, they had
won the debate. Springer very
adroitly caused this assertion to
react against the negative by call
ing attention to the fact that it was
the negative, not the affirmative,
that was advocating a change of
policy, and that upon the Berkeley
debaters, therefore, rested the ne
cessity of proving what is called in
parliamentary usage a "universal
negative." In closing, the speaker
rapidly reviewed the arguments
presented, and left the decision to
the judges, who, after a short con
sultation, announced a majority
decision for the affirmative.
Afler the decision, pandemonium
reigned among the Stanford cohorts
for fully ten minutes, and then a
procession was formed, which
marched, singing and cheering,
down Market street to the Palace
Hotel, where three hoarse but vig
orous cheers were given for the
Cardinal and the team.
The news of the victory was re
ceived at Stanford a few minutes
after the decision was rendered, and
in a short while the members of
the student body went wild with
excitement and enthusiasm. Jn
less time than it takes to tell of it,
a monster bonfire was blazing in
the center of the diamond, and
cheering students were encircling
it in a mad dance. When the fire
burned low, as if by common im
pulse the whole crowd dispersed, to
return in a moment with boxes,
barrels, and any fuel it could lay
its hands on. When these were
exhausted another scamper took
place, and in a moment returned
bearing whole haycocks from the
surrounding fields. These soon
went up in sparks and smoke.
During this time the University
whistle was keeping up a continual
tooting, sometimes articulated into
the Stanford yell, and sometimes a
mere chaos of sound. It was a
long time before the tumult died
away, and it was revived in part
on the arrival of those who came
down on the one o'clock train. As
an expression of enthusiasm and
spirit, the whole affair was one of
the most noteworthy ever held on
the campus in honor of a Stanford
victory.

Never in the history of Pacific
Coast intercollegiate contests has
an event fraught with deeper
significance occurred, than the
winning of the annual debate by
Stanford from the University of
California in San Francisco Sat
urday night. For the fourth time
nominally since the event was in
augurated, for the fifth time actu
ally, we have wrested forensic hon
ors from our opponents. The
croakers, if any there be, the proph
esiers of evil, the pessimistic mourn
ers of the "good old pioneer days,"
are relegated to the past, and hope
ful optimism prevails. In a field
which, after all, is perhaps the tru
est meeting-ground for the univer
sities, Stanford has won a victory
from the best debating team Berke
ley has ever sent out.
Three thousand people had
crowded into Metropolitan Temple
by 8 o'clock, the time set for the
opening of the debate. The Cardi
nal contingent of " rooters " occu
pied a roped-off section of the or
chestra chairs at the right of the
main aisle, while the balcony was
emblazoned with the blue and gold
streamers of California's support
ers. The latter outnumbered the
Stanford representatives three to
one, but the Palo Alto men had no
trouble in keeping up their end of
the chaffing that was bandied back
and forth, and kept the audience
in good humor until the speaking
commenced. Berkeley had just re
ceived the news of their team's de
feat at New Haven, and were feeling
rather glum in consequence, but
Stanford tendered all sorts of con
dolences, and magnanimously
wished them "better luck next
time" The audience was a thor
oughly representative one, and re
markable especially for the number
of lawyers in attendance, presum
ably in search of enlightenment for
themselves on a knotty constitu
tional question.
The Stanford debaters, who sat
at the right of the platform, were
John E. Springer, '00, Miss Anna
G. Fraser, '00, and Cecil M. Mar
rack, '01. For Berkeley, Fred E.
Borton,Owen E. Hotle, and Wiltsie
M. Martin. The judges were the
Hon. Erskine M. Ross, Hon. Thomas
P. Hawley, and Hon. J. A. Cooper
At a quarter past eight Dr. F. A.
Fetter of Stanford, happily chosen
presiding officer after some delay,
opened the exercises with an ex
planation of the question for de
bate, which was as follows: " Re
solved, That the guarantees of the
Constitution should extend to all
persons and territory under the
permanent control of the United
States, except to persons living in
tribal relations."
" The phrase, ' the guarantees of
the Constitution,'" said Professor
Fetter, "is understood to include
not only the securities for personal
liberty, but also the provision, ' but
all duties, imports, and excises shall

be uniform throughout the United
States.' 'fhe judges shall render
their decision on the merits of the
debate ; the merits of the question
shall not be considered save as they
are presented in the debate. Each
speaker will be allowed twenty
minutes, and the affirmative will
have ten minutes additional in
which to close." J. E. Springer
of Stanford was then introduced as
the leader for the affirmative.
Before entering upon his main
arguments, Springer defined the
question in hand, and set forth
clearly the plan of procedure which
he and his colleagues were to adopt.
"There are," he said, " two im
portant points about this debate.
First, we are not discussing the
question whether our new posses
sions should or should not be per
manently retained, —that has noth
ing to do with this debate. We are
discussing a principle applicable to
territory in general, and not to any
specific piece of territory. • If that
territory is retained, we say that
the principle should be applied to
all territory. Second, we are dis
cussing a general principle, and not
a specific case.
"The first proposition we wish to
lay down is that our position does
not involve giving the inhabitants
of the territories political privi
leges. We say that they should be
given personal and civil rights, but
not political privileges."
After elaborating this point at
length, and citing the Constitution
and various other high authorities

try, past and present. For our op
ponents to establish their case they
must show that the Constitution
should be changed."

tend the guarantees of the Consti
tution to our territory, she must
enter upon the un-American and
unconstitutional policy of imperial
