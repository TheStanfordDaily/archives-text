With the debating victory of
Saturday one instinctively connects
the name of John E. Springer,
doing all justice to the other two
representatives, for the persever
ance he has shown during the laßt
two years in upholding Stanford's
debating interests. It has been all
the more noticeable in that these
have been darker days than those
to which we were formerly accus
tomed. While the work of the de
bater, is not always appreciated as
it might be, the determination to
secure ultimate success for Stan
ford in this line which has been
shown by Springer is the spirit
which appeals to students devoted
to their University's intercollegiate
success.
