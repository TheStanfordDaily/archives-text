There is little sympathy to be
found with those who urge in
excuse for their non-attendance at
the debate their fear that our team
would be defeated. Of all the
reasons which could be assigned,
in fact, this is the most contempt
ible. Even to remain away out of
pure indifference is less deserving
of censure. It would seem that
those who were able to, but did not
attend, would not feel like bringing
their indifference into prominence
by excusing it. But when they
openly declare their unwillingness
to share the fortunes of their team,
their action assumes an aspect
which deserves more than a passing
comment. Our sacrifice as partisan
spectators in risking the moment
ary chagrin of defeat is very slight
indeed compared to that of our rep
resentatives in the contest. Those
of us who would leave them unsup
ported or let the burden of support
fall upon others on account of fears
as t® the outcome deserve none of
the credit for the maintenance of that
"Stanford spirit" which has been
characteristic of our student body
from the day of its origin. We
know that, exhibitions of such a

spirit as this have been extremely
few in the past and trust this oc
casion may never be repeated in
the future.
