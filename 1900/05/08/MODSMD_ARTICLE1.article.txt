### 
The University Inn last evening
was the scene of a pleasant recog
nition of the services of the team
who won the intercollegiate debate
from Berkeley. .J. F. Springer,
Miss Fraser, and C. M. Marrack
were tendered a complimentary
dinner by Professors Howard. Ross,
Lathrop, Fetter, and Duniway. lie
sides members of the faculty and
their wives, there were present:
J. F. English, F. B. Wagner, and
Charles Quayleof the second team,
J. T. Burcham, Frank Adams, and
L. B. Wickersham of the committee
on intercollegiate debates.
The purpose of the dinner was to
celebrate the recent victory, paying
special honor to the successful rep
resentatives of the University's de
bating interests. Professor Howard,
who presided as toastmaster for the
informal speech making, pointed
out the great significance of our
success. He urged that such a vic
tory, on the basis of sound prepa
ration and broad minded presenta
tion of a difficult subject, must set
a high standard for all future de
baters. The absence of any reli
ance upon technicalities, the gen
erous interpretation of a doubtful
question, was especially to be com
mended. He congratulated the
team upon the rightful pleasure
which is theirs from the stimulus
of victory in an intellectual con
test.
Professor Fetter defined the lim
its of faculty coaching for a team
in an intercollegiate debate. The
healthful degree of self-help among
Stanford students had led, lie be
lieved, to the best results. The
faculty will always be responsive
and sympathetic when the initia
tive in seeking advice is taken by
the team. Our major system makes
it possible for high-grade expert
advice to come from fellow stu
dents. That form of student coop
eration should be encouraged. A
second team should give its servicesi
to debating auainst the University
team, and afford them practice in
the actual conditions to be met.
Professor Lathrop commented
upon the widest improvement of
this last team over their predeces
sors in the element of direct re
sponse to the attacks of their ad
versaries.
Professor Duniway believed that
the victory was the result of adher
ence to sound principles of general
preparation, as well as to the spe
cial training for this event.
Each member of the team, Mr.
English, and Mr. Adams, also spoke
briefly. Mr. Springer gave gener
ous recognition to the help of Mr.
English The cordiality and value
of faculty advice were also ac
knowledged.
