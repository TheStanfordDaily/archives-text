It gives considerable pleasure
to chronicle victory for Stanford in
the last intercollegiate event of the
year. As for these debates, the
score now stands even between the
two universities, though we have
one extra victory to our credit if the
first contest were counted. But the
success of Saturday is worth more
than merely evening up the debat
ing score. Our prospects for next
year are by no means so dim that
they are disagreeable to contem
plate in themselves, but, neverthe
less, this victory has considerable
value in giving us assurance for the
future. There are some among us
even who are prone to take advan
tage of a series of defeats as an ex
cuse for a less vigorous prosecution
of an endeavor to turn the tables.
To these we recommend some
thought on the success which per
sistence and determination have
brought us in debating. There is
much in tact for all of us to see in
the victory our intercollegiate team
brought home to encourage a deter
mination that next year's round of
contests will be a renewal of the
record that has always followed us
with such persistence until the last
two years.
