## 
### 
The intercollegiate rules commit
tee on football, composed of Robert
D. Wren, Harvard ; Walter Camp,
Yale; Alexander Moffatt, Prince
ton ; Paul Dashiel, Annapolis ; .).
M. Dennis, Cornell, and John C.
Bell, Pennsylvania, met in Phila
delphia last week, and completed
the work of revising the rules which
will govern gridiron contests dur
ing the coming year. The changes
made are final, and there will be no
other meeting of the committee this
year.
Contrary to expectations, no
change was made in the scoring
rules. To do away with side-line
coaching, it was decided to limit
the number of persons given side
line privileges to five for each con
testing team. All other attaches
of the respective teams must be
seated along the inclosure and in
side the rope lines. As a further
preventive of side-line coaching, it
was decided to penalize the team so
offending by the loss of ten yards,
the down remaining the same as it
was at the time the foul was com
mitted. If the team guilty of side
line coaching is playing on the de
fensive, then the other side will be
given ten yards and a first down.
Another rule that was changed
was the one which has heretofore
permitted a team to retain posses
sion of the ball and have first down
by losing twenty yards. Under
the new rule a, team will be permit
ted to lose twenty yards and retain
the ball but once during the game.
Another rule changed was in ref
erence to the committing of a foul
by a team behind its own goal line.
Heretofore when such a foul has
l>ppn made, ljke a forvyaj-d pass, for
instance, the ball has gone t<> the
other side for a touchdown. Here
after it will count as a safety,
Regarding t}ie penalty for offside
play, it was decided that instead of
making the team so offendin b lose
the ball, it shall be sent back ten
yards and still retain possession of
the ball, and the down be also the
same as when the foul was com
mitted.
11 yvas also decided that the linpe
fnen must their stands on the
side line, and regulate the positions
of the flags marking the gains and
losses. A few minor changes vyej-e
made in t|ie wording of certain
rules simply to make them clearer.
