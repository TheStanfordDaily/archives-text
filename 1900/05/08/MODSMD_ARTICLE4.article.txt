# Stanford Press Club.
## 
### 
There is talk of forming a Stan
ford press club in San Francisco.
The nucleus of the membership
would he the sixteen Stanford men
now actively engaged in newspaper
work in that city. The idea is to
make of it a unique and thoroughly
bohemian young men's club with
quaintly decorated rooms in some
old building in the Latin quarter,
where the late workers could amuse
themselves or entertain friends after
midnight.
The increase of Stanford men in
metropolitan journalism iias been
reniakable. In less than Hve years
Stanford has come to have
more representatives .in the
profession in San Francisco than
have all other universities com
bined. On the Chronicle alone there
are now seven Stanford men â€” Rice,
'95; Benson and Hitchhorn, ex-'9o;
Merle Johnson, '97, as an artist ;
Everett W. Smith, '99 ; Will Ray
mond, ex-'99 ; and "Jack" Wal
dorf, ex-01. On the Examiner are
E. N. Gale, '95, and " Mick" Irwin,
ex-'OO. On the Call are Miss Sarah
Cotnstock, '9(5; and John Briscoe,
ex-'OO. On the Post are Ed Ewell,
ex-'95, as assistant business man
ager ; James R. Nourse, '97 ; and
Charles Whittle, ex-'OO. On the
Argonaut is " Bill " Neidig, '96. On
the Wave is " Bill " Irwin, '99. On
the Railroad Gazetteer is 10. R. Zion,
'94, as editor.
