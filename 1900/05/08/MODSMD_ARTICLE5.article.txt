The heroine of the play is Mine.
Marcasse, a young widow living in
the Rue de hi Oannebiere in Mar
seilles, who hits decided that a life
of single blessedness has no attrac
tions for her ;tfivr her delightful
recent experience. Godefroid, the
son of M. Bea.utendou, one of her
business correspondents (she is the
owner of a soap factory in Mar
seilles), had stopped a few days at
her house, had won her affections,
and she decides to marry him.
This resolve ix hastened by an in
vitation which M. Beautendon in
advertently sends her to stop at his

house should she ever come to Paris.
With characteristic southern im
petuosity she accepts at once and ar
rives with her maid Miette a few
hours earlier than Mine, de Sainte-
Poule and her dauuhter, Blanche,
who have been invited by M. Beau
tendon for the express purpose of
arranging the betrothal of the two
young people. The appearance of
Mine. Marcasse completely upsets
Antoine, the servant, and causes
all sorts of complications in the
household. M. Beautendon is too
polite even to hint the truth to
Mine. Marcasse, and she will allow
nothing to interfere with the reali
zation of her desires. For a while
it looks as though she were actually
going to win the day, when fortun
ately it is discovered that M. Mar
casse is still alive. Being no longer
a widow, she is then ready to re
