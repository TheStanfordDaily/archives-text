Nearly a thousand spectators
witnessed the basket-bull game
played on Saturday at lieno be
tween the Palo Alto and the Ne
vada University teams. The Ne
vada University band mei the girls
at the station, and after lunch the
game took plaee in the gymnasium.
Both teams were entertained at
dinner at the Delta ftho house,
after which a bull was given at the
gymnasium.
The line-up of the teams was as
follows:
Palo Alto team —R.g., Mary Gil
man; I. g., Irene Pitcher; r.c., Vida
Ducker: c., Frances Tucker; 1. c.,
Mattie Downing; r. 112., Winifred
Morgan; I. 112., Mabel Ray. Palo
Alto substitutes, Mary Downing,
Eulavelle Sweetland, Georgia Pit
man, and Gertrude Home. Umpire,
Miss Jessie Downing. Chaperon,
Mrs. Morgan of Oakland.
Nevada team — Misses Maud
Nash, Lillian Marrette, and Tillie
Kruger, forwards; Frances Kirby,
renter; Ethel Peckham, Ethel
Sparks, and Kate McGowan, guards.
Nevada substitutes, Fern Gedney,

Lulu Becker, Grace Cox, Dora Hill,
and Jla Bradshaw. Umpire, Miss
Stella Linscott. Timekeeper, Mine
Gene A mot. Scorer, Miss Beth
Stubbs.
At the end uf the second half the
score stood 2 to 2; Nevada throwing
a goal in the second half decided
the game in favor of the sage brush
team.
But one of the Palo Alto team
had ever played in-doors, and the
effect of the altitude was very no
ticeable on the players. The Ne
vada team work was especially
good, while the individual work
of the Palo Alto girls deserves equal
mention.
