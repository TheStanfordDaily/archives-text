# SENIOR CLASS FARCE.
## The 						Story of "To Have and to Lose," a Farce in Three Acts. 
### 
The Senior Farce "To Have and
to Lose" is strictly a college play,
dealing with affairs about Stan
ford and, incidentally, Mayfield.
Two professors, Binks and Jinks,
conceive the idea in their sixtieth
year to go on a voyage of explora
tion of original research to Pata
gonia. To accompany them they
have asked one Ptomeley Hinks, the
son of an old classmate of theirs.
On a certain day he arrives in Palo
Alto, but is immediately seized by
an overzealous fraternity and hus
tled off tothechapter-house. With
the arrival of Hinks one Tom Tut
tle returns to college after an
absence of five years. The sole
remaining acquaintance of his—
Ned Harris—receives him. They
begin to celebrate the return of
Tuttle, and betake themselves to the
merry confines of Mayfield. There
Tuttle endeavors to purloin a cigar
lighter and is put to flight by the
constabulary — a raving, tearing
bad man from Texas —who tracks
Tuttle to the house of Binks, where
Tuttle, having found an open win
dow, takes possession of the profes
sor's library. The Binks family,
expecting Hinks, surprise Tuttle
and take him for Hinks, pouring
salutations, oscillatory and other
wise, thick and fast upon him, much
to the terror of Tuttle, who still
fears arrest. He is quickly shown
to the room intended for Hinks,
where the clothes of Hinks lie
waiting to receive him. Tuttle,
thinking that he is in a private
lunatic asylum, does as he is bid,
and dons the clothes of Hinks, who
in the meantime has arrived, after
having escaped the clutches of the
fraternity, and is shown to his
room by the Irish servant girl.
Meanwhile below stairs there is
turmoil. The constable has en
tered, and declares his intention
of arresting Tuttle on general prin
ciples, and is abput to cjo so, when
the reivl Hinks enters in Tuttle's
clothes. Hinks is arrested and goes
to jail, while Tuttle remains in the
place prepared for Hinks.
Binksand Jinks,determined upon
the exploration of Patagonia, make
ready to go in spite of the entreaties
of Airs. Binks. a seething person
age.
To add to the discomforture of
Tuttle, a daughter of Binks finds
out his identity and threatens to
tell the police. To put a stop to
her disclosures Tuttle promises her
he will persuade her father from
going on the proposed trip, She
agrees, and allows him twelve hours
to keep his promise. Previous to
this Tuttle had found on the coat
of Hinks a letter and a package
addressed to Binks. Tuttle reads
the letter and finds that the pack
age contains powders which, when
given to any one in drinking water,
will cause the drinker to fall under
the power of persons giving the pow
ders. Tuttle, to make his promise
good, secretly administers a powder
to each, Binks and Jinks, who at
once come under his control. He
then takes them to an open place
back of Mayfield, where he has
erected an artificial Patagonia. For

| the inhabitants of his Patagonia
,he hires a troop of strolling players
j who happen at the time to he in
hard luck. Binks and Jinks engage
in original research and discover
brickbats and beer bottles. Hinks,
in the meantime, breaks jail and is
followed by the constable of May
fild, who causes much annoyance
to the erstwhile Patagonians.
Minks, on account of his great valor
in fighting the mighty Dingbat, a
most ferocious animal, is crowned
king by the would-be Patagonians.
He occupies the throne, but, alas,
is despoiled of his power by the
court necromancer, Domeup, whose
ire is excited by the doubting re
marks of Hinks. In punishment
for this Domeup swears that he in
court assembled will cause to ap
pear supernaturally the one person
whom Hinks desires to see the least.
Alas, in the focus of the incanta
tions by Domeup, the seething Mrs.
Hinks appears, on the warpath, and
leads her husband home by the
ear. Binks promises never again
to mention Patagonia, Tutlle is re
instated in the good graces of all,
and Jinks hides himself for a week
in Berkeley. Hinks marries the
Roble cook and goes straight home
to papa.
The farce is in three act Hand
five scenes. Throughout the play
clever vaudeville turns will be in
troduced.
