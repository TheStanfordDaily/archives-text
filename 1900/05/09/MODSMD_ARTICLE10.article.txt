# Commencement Music.
## 
### 
As was announced by Dr. Jordan
last evening, the Choral Society of
Palo Alto has kindly agreed to fur
nish music on Commencement Day
if a sufficient number of our Uni
versity singers will unite with it.
This offer should meet with a most
generous response. We owe it to
Dr. Little, the president of the so
ciety, who has sung for us so often,
and to Mr. Morris, the director,
who has always been so generous in
his services to our musical organ
izations, and we owe it to ourselves.
Let all who can sing make it a
point to attend the campus re
hearsal at the chapel next Monday
at 4:30, whether they get a personal
invitation or not. Soprano voices
are especially desired.
