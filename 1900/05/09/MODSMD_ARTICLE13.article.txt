# Choral Society Concert.

### 
The Palo Alto Choral Society
made its first appearance before a
Stanford audience last night, under
the leadership of J. J. Morris. This
organization should serve a very
useful purpose under such efficient
direction, for the work was a sur
prise.
The parts of the chorus, which
contained over fifty voices, were
quite evenly balanced. The women's
voices were fresher and more pleas
ing than those of the men. This
was quite noticeable in the first
number of the program, "The Mil
ler's Wooing," by Failing. By far
the best selection presented by the
society was Garrett's "Oh, My
Love's Like a lied, Red Rose."
This was sung in a robust, vivacious
manner, with due regard to the
tempo and dynamic marks. Mrs.
Jager's accompanying was through
out sympathetic and intelligent.
The same can be said of Mrs.
Starbuck's accompaniment of Mrs.
A. W.Smith, who sang the ballad
of "Tom, the Rhymer." It is al
ways refreshing to hear Mrs. Smith's
clean, precise technique and frank
vocalization. She sang as an en
core Arthur Foote'sexquisite "Irish
Folksong."
Dr. Little's contribution to the
program was very pleasing. Buck's
"Creole Love Song" was rendered
with good feeling and excellent
technique.
