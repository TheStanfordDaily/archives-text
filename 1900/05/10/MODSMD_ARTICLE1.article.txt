# "THE BLOOD OF THE NATION."
## Dr. Jordan Speaks Before a Large Audience in the Chapel. 
### 
The chapel was crowded last
night to hear the lecture of Dr.
Jordan on "The Blood of the Na
tion," which lie delivered in the
East while on his recent trip. The
lecture was in substance as follows :
" It is recognized Unit the hlood
of a nation largely determines iis
history. Knowing the nature of a
race, we can forecast its achieve
ments, and by its history its blood
is determined, the word 'blood'
being used in this connection as
meaning heredity. The nature of
a race is determined by the quali
ties of tiiose who leave offspring.
In a herd of cattle the destruction
or removal of the strongest mem
bers leaves the weak ones to become
the parents of the future herd, and
degeneration is the result. On the
other hand, if the strongest are
preserved the herd of the future
will be descended from the best.
The same is true of human history,
and if similar processes are fol
lowed, like results will ensue.
" Democracy which equalizes the
opportunities of men is the most
favorable condition for race im
provement by the preservation of
the best. Slavery,aristocracy, mili
tarism, and imperialism, the four
tyrants of human politics, not one
of which appears without the oth
ers, favor degeneration, as they de
stroy the best, leaving those whom
military power could not use.
"Individual degeneration is an
other thing, and is not inherited,
as every child is born the son of
what his father and mother ought
to have been. Any man degener
ates in an environment of vice or
disease, but his degeneration leaves
his race all the cleaner. The de
generation of Frapce due to a
survival of the men of whom ' The
Man with the Hoe' is the type, and
the destruction of the best of the
country in the French Revolution ;
since that great slaughter the blood
of France has been poorer.
"The basis of English polity has
been and is inequality before the
law. Primogeniture tends to take
the oldest sons out of the struggle
of life, and forces the younger sons'
and daughters' sons back into the
mass of the people. In this way
the English people are largely de
scended from the old nobility, the
sons of slaves and swineherds have
been orowded out by their develop
ment, and thus has primogeniture
been its own remedy and has be
gotten democracy. These younger
sons became the Roundheads, the
Puritans, and the Pilgrims, and
have fought for liberty in England
and America.
"In France, on the other hand,
the nobility and common people
have been kept separate, religions
celibacy has lowered the religious
feeling, and indiscriminate charity,
together with social oppression,
have increased pauperism. Hut the
greater destroyer of nil has been
war. All over Europe are the bat
tlefields on which the best of
France have died,
"Each war for empire has met
the same fate. Greece and Rome
show the same results of war in the

weak and inferior peoples thathave
descended from those who could
not be used in the wars of conquest.
Spain died years ago. The Philip
pine question was a burning one
with her in 1630, and it was said
that Spain 'makes men and wastes
them,' and 'this phrase,' says Lieu
tenant Calkins, 'sums up Spain's
history.' Thus it has always been
in history. The warlike nation of
today is the decadent nation of
tomorrow.
"It has been said that 'war is
essential to the life of a nation; war
strengthens a nation morally, men
tally, and physically.' Such a
statement is the result of sheer ig
norance. War may seem to make
men strong when the hot passions
are on, but hot passion is not inher
ited. War can only waste and
corrupt. Its origin is in the 'evil
passions of men,' and even when
most necessary it is deplorable. If
any war is good, civil war must lie
best. The virtues of victory and
the lessons of defeat would be kept
within the nation. The motto of
modern imperialism is the reverse
of that attributed to the English
boy; it is 'Never bully a big boy, or
turn one's back on a little one.'
Civil war under proper limitations
could remedy this. A time limit
could be adopted, as in football,
and every device chosen to get the
good of war without the evils.
"For example, those of our states
which have suffered most from the
evils of peace, New York and Illin
ois, could be pitted against each
other, with Kentucky as an arena,
while the other states looked on un
disturbed. The armies could be
tilled up from tramps and hood
lums, while the pasteboard heroes
of Delmonicq's and the Chicago
clubs could a ct as officers, All
could be done in decency and order,
and we could have the pomp and
circumstance of war without its
attendant evils.
"If war is good, we should have
it regardless of cost or havoc. But
it is bad, only to be justified as the
last resort of 'mangled, murdered
liberty,' and to be evoked when all
other arts of self-defense fail. The
remedy for most ills of men is not
to be sought in 'whirlwinds of re
bellion that shake the world,' but
in peace and justice, equality
among men, and the cultivation of
those virtues we call Christian be
cause they have been virtues ever
since man and society began, and
will be virtues still when the era of
strife is past and the'red-coat bully
in his boots' no longer 'hides the
march of men from us.' "

corrupt. Its origin is in the 'evil
passions of men,' and even when
most necessary it is deplorable. If
any war is good, civil war must lie
best. The virtues of victory and
the lessons of defeat would be kept
within the nation. The motto of
modern imperialism is the reverse
of that attributed to the English
boy; it is 'Never bully a big boy, or
turn one's back on a little one.'
Civil war under proper limitations
could remedy this. A time limit
could be adopted, as in football,
and every device chosen to get the
good of war without the evils.
"For example, those of our states
which have suffered most from the
evils of peace, New York and Illin
ois, could be pitted against each
other, with Kentucky as an arena,
while the other states looked on un
disturbed. The armies could be
tilled up from tramps and hood
lums, while the pasteboard heroes
of Delmonicq's and the Chicago
clubs could a ct as officers, All
could be done in decency and order,
and we could have the pomp and
circumstance of war without its
attendant evils.
"If war is good, we should have
it regardless of cost or havoc. But
it is bad, only to be justified as the
last resort of 'mangled, murdered
liberty,' and to be evoked when all
other arts of self-defense fail. The
remedy for most ills of men is not
to be sought in 'whirlwinds of re
bellion that shake the world,' but
in peace and justice, equality
among men, and the cultivation of
those virtues we call Christian be
cause they have been virtues ever
since man and society began, and
will be virtues still when the era of
strife is past and the'red-coat bully
in his boots' no longer 'hides the
march of men from us.' "
The chapel was crowded last
night to hear the lecture of Dr.
Jordan on "The Blood of the Na
tion," which lie delivered in the
East while on his recent trip. The
lecture was in substance as follows :
" It is recognized Unit the hlood
of a nation largely determines iis
history. Knowing the nature of a
race, we can forecast its achieve
ments, and by its history its blood
is determined, the word 'blood'
being used in this connection as
meaning heredity. The nature of
a race is determined by the quali
ties of tiiose who leave offspring.
In a herd of cattle the destruction
or removal of the strongest mem
bers leaves the weak ones to become
the parents of the future herd, and
degeneration is the result. On the
other hand, if the strongest are
preserved the herd of the future
will be descended from the best.
The same is true of human history,
and if similar processes are fol
lowed, like results will ensue.
" Democracy which equalizes the
opportunities of men is the most
favorable condition for race im
provement by the preservation of
the best. Slavery,aristocracy, mili
tarism, and imperialism, the four
tyrants of human politics, not one
of which appears without the oth
ers, favor degeneration, as they de
stroy the best, leaving those whom
military power could not use.
"Individual degeneration is an
other thing, and is not inherited,
as every child is born the son of
what his father and mother ought
to have been. Any man degener
ates in an environment of vice or
disease, but his degeneration leaves
his race all the cleaner. The de
generation of Frapce due to a
survival of the men of whom ' The
Man with the Hoe' is the type, and
the destruction of the best of the
country in the French Revolution ;
since that great slaughter the blood
of France has been poorer.
"The basis of English polity has
been and is inequality before the
law. Primogeniture tends to take
the oldest sons out of the struggle
of life, and forces the younger sons'
and daughters' sons back into the
mass of the people. In this way
the English people are largely de
scended from the old nobility, the
sons of slaves and swineherds have
been orowded out by their develop
ment, and thus has primogeniture
been its own remedy and has be
gotten democracy. These younger
sons became the Roundheads, the
Puritans, and the Pilgrims, and
have fought for liberty in England
and America.
"In France, on the other hand,
the nobility and common people
have been kept separate, religions
celibacy has lowered the religious
feeling, and indiscriminate charity,
together with social oppression,
have increased pauperism. Hut the
greater destroyer of nil has been
war. All over Europe are the bat
tlefields on which the best of
France have died,
"Each war for empire has met
the same fate. Greece and Rome
show the same results of war in the

weak and inferior peoples thathave
descended from those who could
not be used in the wars of conquest.
Spain died years ago. The Philip
pine question was a burning one
with her in 1630, and it was said
that Spain 'makes men and wastes
them,' and 'this phrase,' says Lieu
tenant Calkins, 'sums up Spain's
history.' Thus it has always been
in history. The warlike nation of
today is the decadent nation of
tomorrow.
"It has been said that 'war is
essential to the life of a nation; war
strengthens a nation morally, men
tally, and physically.' Such a
statement is the result of sheer ig
norance. War may seem to make
men strong when the hot passions
are on, but hot passion is not inher
ited. War can only waste and
corrupt. Its origin is in the 'evil
passions of men,' and even when
most necessary it is deplorable. If
any war is good, civil war must lie
best. The virtues of victory and
the lessons of defeat would be kept
within the nation. The motto of
modern imperialism is the reverse
of that attributed to the English
boy; it is 'Never bully a big boy, or
turn one's back on a little one.'
