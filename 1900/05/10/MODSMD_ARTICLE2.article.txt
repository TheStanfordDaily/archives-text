# Address Before the Graduate Club.
## 
### 
On the afternoon of Alumni Day
Dr. Howard of the department of
History will .speak extemporane
ously on "The Significance of Grad
uate Studies in the American Uni
versities." Conditions are becom
ing more favorable for the migra
tion of students among American
universities, and it is to he the
policy of Stanford University to
place more emphasis upon the
graduate work, in order that grad
uates of eastern universities may
find here attractive and profitable
means of pursuing advanced study.
As a first step toward this some

what new policy, President Jordan
has suggested that there be an ad
dress before the Graduate Club on
Alumni Day, with the intention of
its becoming a permanent feature
of the Commencement program.
Dr. Howard has long interested
himself in the development of grad
uate work in the American univer
sity, and though arrangement for
such an address was not made until
a very late day, its value to all in
terested is evident. It will be given
in the chapel at 3 o'clock Tuesday,
May 29th.
