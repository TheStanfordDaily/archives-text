Manager YVardall, in speaking of
track work for the next year, ex
pressed himself as being favorably
impressed by the prospects. All
the prominent men of this year's
team, except Boyd and Hopper,
will be back next semester, and if
'04 does as well as '03 has done in
the line of new material, the man
agement will be able to bring out a
winning team. Already there are
rumors of a 10-second sprinter, a
fast hurdler, and two strong men
with the weights to enter next year.
Training will be commenced in
the fall and carried on systemat
ically throughout the year. Doctor
Murphy will probably be back, and
will be assisted by alumni coaches
who have been prominent in track
work, among them Everett Smith,
'99, Joe Kernhard, '96, and Tom

Carroll. Cross-country runs will be
instituted, and a medal given for
one year to the winner of a single
run, or permanently to the winner
of two out of three runs.
The track men will hold a meet
in the fall just before the holidays,
in which the teams of the prepara
tory schools of the vicinity will be
invited to compete with the Uni
versity team. The track meet, of
the Academic League will probably
be held on the University oval
next year. These prospects should
awaken an interest in track ath
letics which will evolve the best
team the University has ever had.
