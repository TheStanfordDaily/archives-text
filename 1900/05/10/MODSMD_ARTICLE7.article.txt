Sincr the adoption of the ath
letic agreement for campus contests
has become a reality, it becomes
more of a duty even than has pre
viously been the case to keep stu
dent body expenditures on a min
imum consistent with the welfare
of our interests. While this year
has seen a greater revenue than
ever before, it has also been a year
of great expenditure. Our differ
ent interests have all received un
stinted support financially, but as a
result of this the semester promises
to close with but slight assets in the
treasury. In all probability there
will be no material change in the
income next fall, as the football
game, the principal source of rev
enue, will as usual be held in San
Francisco. After that, however,
the prospects are fora considerably
decreased net revenue from inter
collegiate contests, while the de
mands upon the treasury will in
crease with the improvements neces
sary on the campus grounds. A
considerable surplus had been ex
pected this year and it is with some
disappointment that the assets have
been seen falling so rapidly. The
Executive Committee will do well
to seriously consider all these con
ditions before deciding upon con
tracts for next year, and the new
officers who are about to assume
their duties should keep them in
mind from the beginning of their
administration. No loyal Stanford
man would see any of the advan
tages restricted with which our
representatives are now indulged,
but, nevertheless, there is always
considerable field for alert economy,
especially on the part of the treas
urer, and it is that which may be
brought into play to keep expenses
down. We know that the confi
dence of the student body in the
treasurer-elect has not been mis

placed and believe that, keeping in
mind all principles of economy con
sistent with the circumstances, the
finances will not suffer through any
lack of carefulness on his part.
There is room for support of such a
policy by other student body of
ficers and we trust that it will
never be lacking, especially not as
we enter into a new status, the suc
cess of which is nothing but a mat
ter of surmise.
