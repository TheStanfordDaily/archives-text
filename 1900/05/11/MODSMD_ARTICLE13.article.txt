# Notice to Football Men.
## 
### 
It is extremely necessary that all
football goods be in before the end
of this semester, so that we may
know how many new suits to order,
and, also, that all old suits may be
repaired before next year. Please
let every man attend to this mat
ter at once, and see that his suit,
whether belonging to himself or the
Associated Students, be handed to
the tailor, Louis Benoit, at once.
