With this issuk end the regular
numbers of volume XVI of the
Daily Palo Alto. The editor-in
chief takes the opportunity to thank
the members of the stuff who have
worked with him during the semes
ter, â€”for himself <>n account of the
invaluable assistance i Ley have
rendered, as well as in behalf of the
student body for the efforts they
have put forth to make Stan
ford University's daily publication
maintain its place in the very front
rank of similar journalistic enter
prises in American universities.
He wishes especially to express ap
preciation of the interest the news
editor, Miss M. E. McDouguld, '02,
has constantly shown in the wel
fare of the paper, and would men
tion Thoreau Cronyn, '02, as de
serving of more than passing
mention among the associates. Of
the assistants, E. M. Davis, '00, VV.
H. Boston, '00, W. C. Day, '01, C.
1). McComish,'o3, Miss I. A. Zilisch,
'03, and Harold Hall, '03, have
seemed particularly earnest in their
work and attentive to their duties.
Of the shortcomings of the paper,
no one can be more appreciative
than a retiring editor, and all that
can he said of them in extenuation
is that everything has been done
that was thought best under the
circumstances. We realize, how
ever, that amateur journalism has
distinct limitations, and that be
yond these, conditions make it al
most impossible to progress. In
conclusion, we wish to express our
best wishes for the success of next
semester's management, and trust
that we have at lest handed over a
paper no less deserving than that
which we received.
