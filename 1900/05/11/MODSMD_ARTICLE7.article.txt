In the continual objections
which are made about unnecessary
restrictions imposed on students by
the library authorities, there is
considerable justification. We wish
that department of the University
could recognize all of that freedom
of individuals for which Stanford
has largely gained a reputation,
that is consistent with good man
agement. A University library is
not by any means the same kind of
an institution as is a public one,

for instance. A University com
munity can be intrusted with privi
leges which could very properly be
denied to others. This fact we do
not think has been recognized in
the library since the occupation of
the new building as completely as
it should be, and correspondingly
there has been a decrease of the
benefit which we should obtain.
Petty regulations have continually
been imposed, some of them for but
slight duration, which have justi
fied a feeling among the students
that they are not trusted more than
might be the indiscriminate public
which visits a public library. All
this has a most detrimental effect
on the incentive to individual stu
dent work which should be held
out wherever possible. We hope
that the library authorities may
next year see fit to al'ow more free
dom to students than has been
done tliis semester, and that there
will be none of those petty restric
tions which accomplish nothing but
to arouse ill feeling.
