# COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS
## Professor Hudson's Speech Before the Graduating Class of 1900. 
### 
Of all forms of mistake, (Jeorge
Eliot somewhere remarks, prophecy
is the most gratuitous. With such
a word of warning well in mind, I
would not wish to make this an oc
casion for indulging myself in any
rash predictions concerning what,
in the way of literature, the future
may or may not have in store. But
for those of us whose business it is
to pay some attention to the social
and intellectual conditions which,
at different times in the world's
history, have favored the free and
effective play of artistic genius, it
is only natural, 1 suppose, to turn
analysis occasionally from the
things of the past upon the circum
stances of our own time and place.
And if, as a result of such analysis,we
are led to speculate a litte curiously
on the possibility of fresh artistic
developments in years to come, we
may perhaps be allowed to do so
without protest, on the understand
ing that we are concerned only with
possibilities, and that we fully rec
ognize how frequently in such mat
ters the most carefully formed
hypotheses may he brought to
naught by the sudden irruption of
factors which have eluded scrutiny
or defied formulation.
Unless the signs of the times are
altogether misleading, therefore, I i
cannot but feel we have legiti
mate cause to believe that in the
not far distant future we may wit
ness, here on the Pacific Coast, the
beginnings of a literary movement
as distinct in character, as racy,
and in its kind as interesting and
valuable as that which, by the
middle of our century, had won
abiding glory for New England.
For here—as the most superficial
observation of the facts and condi-1
tions of California life should suf
fice to show us —the creative artist
of tomorrow — be he poet, novelist,
or dramatist- will find himself in
a new world of rare and splendid
opportunity. Think for a moment
of the stirring story of our still im
mediate past: —a story teeming with
records of adventure, of turbulence,
and violence, and conflict, of prim
itive passions, of bizarre achieve
ments and failures, of dramatic
crises, and the gradual building of
social order out of lawlessness and
confusion. There surely is a mass i
of moving incident and picturesque'
character as genuinely romantic
and as profoundly human as that
upon which the genius of Scott was
privileged to draw in the history
and legends of the Border. Nor
will the social field of today prove
a whit less fertile in theme and in
spiration. We have only to note
the striking vigor and diversity of
our western life—the cosmopolitan
ism which has resulted both from
the clash and from the blending of
races —the startling contrasts in
social types and ideals —the fresh
ness of the manhood and woman
hood fostered by our abounding
personal freedom and lack of con
ventional restraints ; -we have only
to note these things to realize that
we have here, indeed, ready to
hand, the raw material for nniny a
rich unwritten chapter in the peren

nial comedie kumaine. Moreover,
in reckoning up conditions, we must
not forget the stimulating qualities
of our mental atmosphere itself.
No one, born and bred in other en
vironments, can live for a few years
in California without remarking
upon the intellectual traits which
characterize the younger genera
tions here —upon their eagerness,
curiosity, expansiveness, generous
sympathies, quick perception, and
instructive response to art. An
artist depends largely upon his
public; and to live in so bracing
an intellectual climate must count
for not a little in his work. And
finally, in the fact that we are here
comparatively free from some of
the cramping influences of puritan-

ism, we may venture to emphasize
another element, which should con
duce somewhat — perhaps materi
ally —to the large and liberal ex
pression of artistic power.
Let it We understood that, in
speaking in this way, I am not ac
cepting, even in its most general
application, Taine's famous and
much-abused formula of the race,
the milieu, and the moment. No
such formula—no formula of any
kind—will explain genius, or ac
count satisfactorily for its manifes
tations ; nor will the closest study
of intellectual conditions and social
forces enable us to indicate before
hand what form any new literature
will take, or whether, indeed, there
will be any new literature worth
talking about. After all, when the
so-called scientific—which is more
often than not a merely pseudo
scientific— method of investigating
literary phenomena, has done its

utmost, it still remains true that,
no matter how favorable the condi
tions, how rich the soil, how keen
the intellectual atmosphere, where
no great poet happens to be born,
we shall have no great poetry;
where no great novelist or dramatist
appears, we shall have no great fic
tion or drama. The wind bloweth
where it listeth.and we must await
the rise of the Creator, the true
maker, and be content to recognize
in his coming what for us must re
main—l do not baulk the word—a
miracle, all our philosophic formu
las notwithstanding. All 1 insist
upon is, that given the literary
genius, the man of insight and cre
ative power, then existing condi
tions here should in many ways be

distinctly favorable to his growth
and free expression. Heine once
remarked that ;i man should he
very careful in the choice of his
parents. In likewise, a poet or
novelist should he very careful
about the place and time of his ap
pearance upon this planet. And a
poet or novelist might certainly do
worse than to get himself born .-it
the moment in California, where,as
I have argued, he will find ample
stimulus and opportunity to work
out whatever power may he in him.
It is natural, therefore, that we,
whose privilege it is to help to
mould in some degree the destinies
of the rising generations, should
look with interest at these various
indications of possible future lit
erary activity, and that such in
terest should be particularly keen
in the case of those of us whose own
work lies on the literary side of the
higher education. And with us, at

all events, this interest is bound to
partake of a practical character.
Noting the signs as we must, and
speculating as we may upon their
value and significance, we are also
led to ask ourselves what we may
personally do—what the University
as an organ and center of culture
may do—to aid and direct the
fores out of which the literary
movements of the future will take
their rise.
In venturing to offer some sug
gestions by way of answer to this
question, 1 may conveniently begin
by laying stress 011 the fact that the
literary influence of the University
and its curriculum will necessarily
be almost wholly critical and dis
ciplinary in its character, By this
I mean that we, within academic
walls, must not nourish the illusory
hope of helping to any extent to
develop the creative spirit, or to
furnish productive strength and
quickening power. Indeed, I will
go so far as to assert that the atti
tude toward literature which is so
sedulously cultivated in our class
rooms, and which it is the main
part of our purpose to cultivate, is,
and always must he, the reverse of
favorable to creative effort. Ob
serve, that I do not now refer to the
unfortunate results which follow
when literature is badly taught—
results which are indeed common
enough, because literature is often
badly taught, but which are none
the less due to abuses in method
and system, and, as such, are not
inevitable. That many young men
and women go out from our col
leges. as many boys and girls go
out from our schools, not only with
out the slightest real apprehension
of the spirit and meaning of the
great masterpieces to which they
have been introduced, but even with
a positive aversion to such master
pieces. is of course a fact to be
deeply deplored. Hut such must
continue to be the main upshot of
our classroom training wherever
the reading of a great piece of lit
erature is made primarily a drill in
linguistics, a course is textual crit
icism, an occasion for the pouring
in of all sorts of general knowledge
—so long, in a word, as the true
ends of literary culture are delib
erately or ignorantly sacrificed to
the ends of so-called—and often
miscalled — scholarship. But all
such evil consequences of the grind
ing of the academic mills—Which,
like the mills of God, grind slowly,
but exceeding small — belong, as J
have said, to the region of abuses
only, and, therefore, need not now
detain us. The point that I now
wish to make goes deeper, and takes
us down to the first principles of
all our academic study of letters.
For, as a matter not of choice, but
of necessity, practically our whole
effort in the classroom is expended
in the training and strengthening
of the critical faculties —our point
of view throughout is the purely
critical pointof view. This cannot,
so far as 1 see, be otherwise. Yet
what is the result ? Literature
conies unavoidably to be regarded
by teachers whose lives are given
up entirely to this point of view,
and therefore by the students who
are brought under their influence,
as a caput mortuum for analysis

and dissection. We go to work
with carefully elaborated methods,
and in the spirit of the disinter
ested scientific inquirer ; we probe,
arrange, classify, generalize, for
mulate ; we discuss environment,
cause and affect, action and reac
tion, influences, schools. Far be it
from me to say that all these things
have not their place and value ;
though it is hard enough sometimes,
in the conduct of our investigations,
to make sure that the finer spirit,
the essential life, the delicate aroma
of literature, do not escape us in
the process. But l.do insist that
all this minute and painstaking
analytic study can at best be of
little service when it comes to the
actual making of literature, and
may sometimes be therein a positive
obstacle. We are only dealing with
commonplaces when we assert that
in the history of literature the crit
ical spirit has been hostile to cre
ative power; and, though no one
would deny that there are many
individual instances in which crit
ical spirit and creative power have
been combined, still, in the average
of cases, the cultivation of the one
must be at the expense of theother.
And as, in our classroom work, our
temper is critical, our standpoint
critical, I conceive that 1 have fully
justified my perhaps rather startling
proposition that the issue of our
labors is, and must necessarily be,
the reverse of favorable to creative
effort.
But all this is, after all, only the
negative view of our academic du
ties, privileges, and responsibilities.
To reach the positive view we have
only to consider the complementary
aspect of our general statement.
For if we say that our work must
be in the main critical and disci
plinary in character, what do we
imply by such a declaration? We
imply, to begin with, that we may
do much to guide and regulate cre
ative genius ; to prevent it from
stultifying itself by errors of judg
ment and mistaken ideals ; to save
it from wasting effort in fruitless
experiments. It has been well said
that an ordinary music-master may
be of much service even to an em
bryo Mozart by pointing out to him
certain things that he must not do,
and so holding him on the high
road to true achievement. And we
imply, moreover, that while we
may do this for the creative artist
himself, we may also aid him and
his work greatly in indirect ways
by our uplifting and enlightening
influence upon the reading public
to which he will make his appeal.
In estimating the duty which the
university owes to society in the
matter of literary culture, I should
say then that it is a large part of
our business to train up, and pass
out into the world, year by year, a
body of good, intelligent, apprecia
tive, and judicious readers, capable
of discriminating between the real
and the meretricious in literature,
and thus of rating the books which
are put before them at something
like their real worth.
Here, then, we reach a point de
serving the strongest emphasis. The
knowledge of literature and of the
history of literature, the clear in
sight and the critical judgment,
which it is our aim, in the Univer
sity classroom, to give and foster,
should yield that culture which in
itself is full of saving grace. In
other words, our ambition must be
to cultivate within our students,
through sympathetic contact with
the greatest and best things in the
literature of the world, a permanent
and high standard of artistic values
—a standard to which all literature
whatsoever may be brought for test.

Because in literature there are no
tinal objective criteria to refer to, it
is sometimes idly supposed that we
can have no stable or trustworthy
criteria at all : —it is all subjective,
we are told ; artistic excellence is
this to me and that to t.hee, and
there the matter must rest. Hut
in fact there is no more reason for
deciding questions of art upon the
opinion of the man in the street,
than there is for allowing him the
last word on questions of astronomy
or biology. Anolate France, vig
orously insisting that all literary
judgments must be merely personal,
once roundly declared that a critic,
to be honest, should say—not,
Gentlemen, I am to speak to you
about Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere ; but, Gentlemen, I am to
speak to you about myself in rela
tion to Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere. Within certain limits, 1
conceive this to be perfectly true.
But is there no distinction to be
made between the verdict of the
literary scholar, when he speaks of
himself in relation to Racine, Pas
cal, Shakspere, and that, let us say,
of the half-educated journalist man
ufacturing an article to order upon
himself in relation to the thinker or
the playwright ? Formal answer
to such a question is surely un
necessary. Though we may admit
the impossibility of establishing
exact objective touchstones, which
will be in the hands of the specialist,
but of which the ordinary individ
ual will know little or nothing—
though we must thus reject any
attempt to put our judgments on
the firm foundations of a science,
we are not, therefore, to regard crit
icism as reduced to anarchy —to a
chaos of feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. We insist upon the
fundamental differences in value
among feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. Jf the scientist re
fuses to take the conclusions of the
first man he meets concerning the
evidence for or against the trans
mission of acquired characters, we
just as emphatically refuse to take
the conclusions of the first man we
meet about the relative importance
of the novels of Jane Austen and
Archibald C. Gunter, or the worth
and significance of the writings of
Charles Lamb or Walter Pater.
No more in literature than in science
are we prepared to accept manhood
suffrage, and settle things by plebis
cite. Only those who know liter
ature in a large and generous way,
who have been in personal com
munion with the great writers of the
past and present, who have consid
ered, analyzed, compared, whose
perception has thus been trained,
whose judgment has thus been
matured —only such are really en
titled to a hearing in matters where
issues of artistic valuation are in
volved. Well, it is part of our duty
in the university to leaven the
reading mass of the public—the vo
racious, untrained, uncritical public
—with the leaven of the higher
culture, and so to send out into
society —not only through teachers
and journalists, but also in the
various walks of private life —lines
of influence which shall help to
raise the general taste, and thus
count positively for good.
Noting all this in a broad way,
we will now try to indicate one or
two special directions in which, as
regards both writers and their read
ers, such culture should be made to
tell.
One considerable danger by which
we who live in California are con
tinually threatened is the danger
which arises from our isolation. In
what ways this isolation affects for
ill the general life of the State, this

is not the place to inquire. Our
concern is simply with its bearings
upon literature ; and in literature,
its evil tendencies are sufficiently
marked. These may be summed
up in the one word —Provincial-
ism,—provincialism, with its ac
companying narrowness of aim and
purpose, of understanding and sym
pathy. Insularity, the French crit
ics are fond of insisting, is always
the prison of art ; and provin
cialism, it would be well for
us to remember, is only another
name for insularity. One would
have supposed that, at this time
of day, people would begin to
realize that the intellectual wel
fare and progress of any com
munity are best guaranteed and
subserved by broad, direct, and
constant contact with the thought
and feeling of the great outer world.
Yet so far is this from being our
case, that here provincialism is de
liberately fostered by the newspa
pers, and by a number of well
meaning but short-sighted theorists
who seem to regard aloofness, self
involution, and intellectual clan
nishness as the one certain means
of insuring individual independ
ence and free personal growth. In
this way we are asked to resuscitate
the exploded ideals of the days of
the Barlows and the Dwights, when,
as a protest against hated British
tyranny, the American writer
sought to break loose altogether
from British literary tradition in
style, method, even orthography ;
we are asked to repeat the demand
of Mr. Hathaway, in " Kaavnagh,"
for a "national literature" which
shall be "altogether shaggy and
unshorn " ; we are asked to adopt
the worst errors of Walt Whitman,
who, in order to show his dem
ocratic vigor and Americanism,
made wild critical assaults upon
Shakspere and Tennyson, and, with
a loud " go to !" set himself to man
ufacture, out of hand, a new litera
ture, fresh in principle,and without
indebtedness to the past. It is ade
quate literary culture that must save
us from such follies in the future,
as it was adequate literary culture —
in the person of Oliver Wendell
Holmes and a few other influential
men of the time —that saved Ainer
tcan literature from them half a
century ago. " I remember," says
Holmes' biographer, Mr. John T.
Morse, " I remember once hearing
a gentleman of some reputation in
literature say —actually in address
ing the Board of Overseers of a dis
tinguished seat of learning—that
he did not approve of teaching
young men to write 'good English,'
to use words accurately, and to
construct sentences gramatically ;
on the contrary, he said that he
wanted an infusion of the wild,
rough inaccuracies of the great new
West! He was," Mr. Morse con
tinues, " the victim of a foolish
notion, that one of the available
ways to show 'American independ
ence of England,' was by devising
a degraded dialect of the English
language for use in the United
States Nor was he alone in this
feeling . . . ; there was for a
while a wild pseudo-literary fad in
this direction. Dr. Holmes looked
upon it with disgust and indigna
tion, making his opinions known
with his usual outspoken courage,
and exemplifying them by his own
action, with the result that he was
for a while subjected to some abuse."
If today we all recognize the bene
ficial influence of Holmes' con
servatism, we should equally recog
nize the important part which such
conservatism —the conservatism of
culture —has still to play, particu
larly in our own western world.

I would not have it supposed that
I overlook the meaning and value
of provincialism, or fail to appre
ciate what is vital and significant,
for example, beneath the strain,
the conscious posturings, the affecta
tions and perversities of Whitman's
work. Literary history shows
clearly enough that, during periods
which tend to formalism and con
vention, provincialism has often
done splendid work by bringing
new material and new blood into
art. The provincial movement is,
for exam[de, to be reckoned one of
the potent generative forces in the
romantic developments of the latter
half of the eighteenth century. Hut
literary history also shows with
equal clearness how futile and un
profitable provincialism always be
comes when it rests mainly on its
sense of newness and isolation —
when it refuses to relate itseif in
direct and healthy contact with
the best things in the world outside
and the transmitted culture of by
gone ages. Many a man of real
genius and promise has fallen short
of effective utterance by wandering
off after some spectral ambition of
originality ; many a fresh move
ment has come to naught because
it has cut itself loose from culture,
and has sought its purpose and its
field in narrow aims and parochial
interests. One of our younger gen
eration of writers has constituted
himself the spokesman and evan
gelist of what lie calls the libera
tion of the "great West." Accord
ing to him, the first important
thing for the "great West" to do
in literature is—to get itself "eman
cipated." Incidentally we might
suggest that the first important
thing for the "great West," or for
any other part of the world, to do
in literature, is to write great books ;
and that it is extremely doubtful
whether any really valuable output
of literature was ever yet heralded
or helped by clamorous and hys
terical demands for emancipation.
Hut these are points which we may
at present leave undiscussed. Con
cerning what Mr. Hamlin Garland
means by emancipation, however,
we need not remain in doubt. The
day of the East —the day of foreign
influence, according to him —is over,
or should be over. In this fact
lies our hope of "emancipation."
The past —the phrase is bis own
"is not vital " ; we must abandon
-the phrase is again his own—its
"crumbling idols"; we must break
once and for all with its traditions,
methods, usages. Now all this is
simply provincialism run mad —
fanatical provincialism, asserting
its own unreason and rejoicing in
it. Let the " great West " manifest
its spirit in literature, by all means;
let it find its own way ; let it
deal freshly with its magnificent
fresh material ; let it build its own
edifice, if necessary, in its own
chosen style of architecture. If it
succeeds, it will succeed because its
work is good, sound, valid —not be
cause it is wrought in an anti-feudal
spirit, or with any dogmatic inten
tion of "emancipating" itself from
anything or anybody. Hut we may
be sure of this —that such work will
not lie done the better or the more
effectively —that it will never be
helped, and may be seriously
marred, and even invalidated—by
being conceived in a boastful tem
per, and planned and carried
through in reckless ignorance of
what has succeeded and what
has failed in the past. When
Mr. Garland himself gives us his
stories of prairie life, we are in
terested, we are moved and stirred,
not because they are examples of
"emancipated" literature, but be
cause, after all, they have in them
some measure of the true life which
has secured pemanence and univer
sality —for all literature worth the
name, from the Book of Job
and the Homeric Epos down
to "The Man Who Was"and
" Madame Delphine." The first
and last aim of the artist
should be to endue his own work
with something of this true life. If
he fail to do so, of what service to
him or to us will be his Declaration
of Independence? If he succeed,
he need not trouble himself about
"emancipation," and rest assured
that we, his readers, will not trouble
ourselves about it in our turn.
What a relief it is, then, to turn
from the crude dogmatism of Mr.
Garland to the wise words of one
who knows literature as a scholar
and feels it as a poet. " Shakspere's
creations," writes Mr. Stedman,
"have been pronounced outworn"
—Shakspere being, of course, one of
the "crumbling idols" handed down
to us from a past which is not
"vital"—"have been pronounced
outworn, because he was the last
great 'poet of feudalism.' We
might as well say that the truth to
human life displayed in Genesis or
Exodus, or the synthetic beauty of
the Parthenon, or the glory (if the
Sistine Madonna, will grow inef
fective, forgetting that these have
the vitality which appertains to the
lasting nature of things. No poet
can ever outrival Shakspere"—can
ever take the place of that "crum
bling idol " —" except by a more ex
ceeding insight and utterance. It is
well said that great art is always
modern." And again, with what
pleasure do we acknowledge the
admirable common sense of some
remarks of another critical master
(who in such matters rarely fails to
hit the mark), concerning the so
called "Irish literary movement,"
which once again is only another
illustration of the outworkings of
the spirit of Provincialism. "J
confess," says Professor Dowden,
"that I am not ambitious of inten
sifying my intellectual or spiritual
brogue. . . . No folly can be
greater than that of fancying
that we shall strengthen our lit
erary position by living exclu
sively in our own ideas" —
that is, by "emancipating" our
selves —"and showing ourselves in
hospitable to the best ideas of other
lands" —and, we may add, of that
great past, which, the "emanci
pated" tell us, is no longer "vital."
And Professor Dowden adds one
most significant remark. "Every
great literary movement of modern
Kurope," be reminds us, "has been
born from the wedlock of two peo
ples." Should not this fact suggest
to us —to those of us, at all events,
who are not so thoroughly emanci
pated as to care nothing for the
teachings of history—that complete
emancipation might after all mean
— complete sterility ?
Hut if we need emancipation, it
is surely emancipation from such
clogging and paralyzing provincial
ism ; and this emancipation we
should help to accomplish in the
university classroom, and by uni
versity culture. Knowledge of the
best in literature that the world
has produced—the fineness of in
sight and the certainty of taste
which are developed by personal
contact with the vital and enduring
elements in the great books of past
and present: these things are what
we need always and everywhere—
and need more than ever today
and here in California—if we would
save ourselves from the perversion
of effort and the waste of power. A
man who has learned to appreciate

and feel what its vital and enduring
in the literature of Greece, England,
Italy, France, Germany —who has
been brought, let us say, under the
discipline of Sophocles, Shakspere,
Dante, Voltaire, Goethe —will have
been swept so far into the great
main current of culture, that he
will be in little danger of being
caught up in momentary eddies, or
washed into obscure backwater of
the stream. In such a school, we
learn to see things in their right
relations, estimate them by true
and permanent standards of value,
and put them into their proper
places.
And how sadly the power to do
this is needed just at present is
made manifest when we observe
the terrible lack of any sense of
proportion and perspective ex
hibited in newspaper reviews,
in magazine articles, in com
mon judgments about books and
authors hastily struck out in
conversation or more deliberately
registered in print. Look for a
moment at our whole modern
business of book-reviewing—note
its conspicuous short-comings—and
ask honestly what for the most part
it is really worth. I do not wish
to seem hard or querulous in my
censure; but in its more popular
forms, at any rate, is it for the most
part really worth anything at all ?
A reviewer, in virtue of his official
position, is supposed (and if this
be but a supposition, then so much
the worse for thefact) —is supposed
to guide and check public opinion
about things of which he is sup
posed (and again if this be but a
supposition, then so much the worse
for the fact), to know more than
the general reader ; it is, by the
hypothesis, his special function to
offer opinions which will help, di
rect, enlighten. Hut in the larger
proportion of cases, is this function
fultilled ? Does the magazine ar
ticle, does the newspaper criticism,
really guide or check, help, direct,
enlighten ? To put the question
in this downright fashion is surely
to answer it. And the worst aspect
of the matter is not, after all, that
article and criticism are so often
evidently the work of men who do
not in the least understand what
they are talking about. That is
bad enough, of course ; but the as
sertions of mere ignorance are, 1
take it, less subtly and less con
stantly dangerous than the distor
tion of critical vision commonly
exhibited even by men who take
their work seriously, write with
more than ordinary care, and show
a laudable desire to say something
to the point. A new novel is pub
lished —a book perhaps with many
admirable qualities and well de
serving a word of cordial recogni
tion. We turn to a notice of it in
a paper or magazine, and we find
the reviewer almost beside himself
in a frenzy of wonder and excite
ment. The work is hailed as a mas
terpiece, the author pronounced on
the spot a writer beside whom—if
we are to take his language at its
liberal meaning—Scott, Balzac,
Thackeray, are as prattling chil
dren. A year or two goes by ; the
great book and the great author
disappear from sight, or drop back
into the rank of the ephemerals;
and the critic, who seems never to
learn by experience, cheerfully and
unblushingiy breaks forth into an
other paeon over the arrival of an
other masterpiece, from the pen of
another genius ot the first, order.
What, we say in our confusion, is
it possible that there are really so
many Scotts, and Balzacs, and
Thackerays about ? Does the spread
of democracy mean that hereafter

geniuses are to l>e plenty as black
berries ? Or why all this fuss ?
And then we recall Browning's
legate who had lived to see —and
see out —four and twenty leaders of
revolt. But though there are moods
in which we may find passing
amusement in the situation, it is
but passing amusement, after all.
For if we are truly in earnest about
literature, all this laxity of critical
opinion must necessarily alarm us,
since we cannot blind ourselves
to the danger—the great and se
rious danger — inherent in our
wholesale abandonment of high
standards and the consequent vitia
tion of public tas-te. And where,
we ask, is any corrective to be
sought ? It must be sought in such
knowledge and insight as are given,
in such discipline and breadth of
view as are afforded, by the culture
of the university classroom. It is
not, indeed, to be argued that any
amount of university training will
of itself make a reviewer conscien
tious in the performance of his diffi
cult and sometimes delicate duty—
especially in these days when even
reputable publishers seek to bias
his mind and "inspire" his utter
ances. But such training will most
certainly give some sense of meas
ure, some feeling fur proportion,
some realization of what has and
what has not substantial claims
upon attention ; and in virtue of
these gains, a man's work as critic,
as leader of opinion, will neces
sarily become more temperate, more
intelligent, more helpful.
And to the culture and training
of the university classroom again,
we have mainly to look for a much
needed check upon yet another ten
dency of our time more widespread
and more generally pernicious than
any yet referred to. The evil of
which we now come to speak is not
local, or of sudden growth ; it per
vades almost the entire reading
world ; and it has developed grad
ually out of the changing social
conditions of the past fifty or sixty
years. I have in mind,as you will
have anticipated, the enormous re
cent growth of periodical litera
ture, and the intellectual results
which are now beginning to be rec
ognized as arising from our ever
increasing dependence upon it.
Ours is, we are often told, em
phatically a, reading age. 1 do not
deny this; indeed, if we consider
only the number of lines of print
per capita actually consumed by
our population, day by day, year
by year, no other age in history
has had such a claim to the dis
tincti >n. But it is, 1 am afraid, at
the same time an age of rapid read
ing, superficial reading, thoughtless
reading —of the kind of reading
which dissipates the energies, un
dermines the power of attention,
and plays havoc with the mind.
Coleridge long ago classed the con
stant perusal of periodicals among
anti-mnemonics, or destroyers of
memory, and looked with dread at
the growth of the magazine and
newspaper habit. If he was
alarmed, what should our feelings
be ? Step into a bookstore in the
early part of the month, and
turn over the magazines, just out,
and freshly exposed for sale, in all
the meretricious attractiveness of
elaborate covers, designed to arrest
the wandering eye. There they are
— ranged in picturesque rows —
pretentious, unpretentious—cheap,
dear —good, bad, indifferent; some
professing literary excellence—some
frankly abandoning all title to any
thing of the kind. Now, of course,
these publications vary in worth as
widely as they differ in their styles ;
and it would be unjust to lump

tliem together, and dismiss them all
with a single \rord of condemnation.
But what is the general impression
they leave upon us when we view
them in the lot ? It is not a pleas
ant impression,certainly. What a
mass of rubbish goes to the mak
ing of these monthly concoctions !
How poor —how unspeakably poor
—is, on the average, the stuff which
they set before their buyers ? How
little in any one of them are we
likely to find what will stand the
test of a second thoughtful reading !
Many of them are scarcely more
than picture-books—collections of
photogravures and the like, accom
panied by some weak explanatory
letter-press ; in most of them, again,
as is natural in an age which has
an unworthy passion for personal
ities, large space is given to portraits
of distinguished or notorious peo
ple, and to the catchpenny gossip
about them which, true or false, is
always held safe to amuse an idle
half-hour. Even, 1 grieve to say,
in our so-called literary magazines
—in periodicals directly devoted to
literature and its interests — the
same childish tendencies are to be
found encroaching on every side.
Here, too, we have not only ac
counts of new publications, and the
information we properly desire to
gain about current affairs in the
book world ; we have also pictures
of all the new rivals of Scott, Balzac,
and Thackeray—of their fathers,
mothers, uncles, and aunts —of
their places of birth and residence
— facsimiles from their manu
scripts, scraps from their letters,
and details innumerable about their
private lives and methods of work
—whether, for instance, they are
married or single, write the more
fluently before breakfast or at mid
night, prefer coffee or tea, golfing or
boating —with other such matter
of manifest importance in the
study of their books. All this is
positively painful. And if a little
serious consideration of our maga
zines fills ns with misapprehen
sion, what shall we say about
our newspapers ? —about our Sun
day newspapers particularly, which
themselves aspire to take rank as
magazines? What shall we say?
Perhaps it will be safest not to at
tempt to say anything. It would
be hard to do justice to such a
subject.
The bearings of our growing habit
of miscellaneous reading upon our
mental life and through this upon
real literature, have been admirably
described by a couple of writers,
whose words will carry so much
more weight than my own, that I
will ask you to listen to them in my
behalf.
Says Charles Dudley Warner : —
"The habit of excessive newspaper
reading, in which a great variety of
topics is inadequately treated, has
a curious effect on the mind. It
becomes demoralized, gradually
loses the power of concentration
or of continuous thought, and even
loses the inclination to read the
long articles which the newspaper
prints. The eye catches a thousand
things, but is detained by no
one. . . . The effect of this
scrappy desultory reading is bad
enough when the hashed compound
selected is tolerably good. It be
comes a very serious matter when
the reading itself is vapid, frivolous,
or bad. The responsibility of se
lecting the mental food for millions
of people is serious. When, in the
last century, in England, the So
ciety for the Diffusion of Useful In
formation, which accomplished so
much good, was organized, this re
sponsibility was felt, and competent
hands prepared the popular books
and pamphlets. . . . Now, it
happens that a hundred thousand
people, perhaps a million in some
cases, surrender the right of the all
important selection of food for their
minds to some unknown and irre
sponsible person whose business it
is to choose the miscellaneous read
ing-matter for a particular news-

paper. His or her taste may he
good, or it may he immature and
vicious ; it may he used simply to
create a sensation ; and yet the
million of readers get nothing ex
cept what this one person chooses
they shall read . . . Day after
day, Sunday after Sunday, they
read only what this unknown per
son selects for them. Instead of
going to the library and cultivating
their own tastes, and pursuing some
subject that will increase their
mental vigor and add to their per
manent stock of thought, they frit
ter away their time upon a hash of
literature chopped up for them by
a person possibly very unfit even
to make a good hash. The mere
statement of this surrender of one's
judgment of what shall be his in
tellectual life, is alarming."
1 have now indicated a few of
the directions in which the aca
demic study of literature should lie
made to count in the interests of
literature itself. It might perhaps
be expected that I should now say
something about the hearings of my
arguments upon our own classroom
work. Hut as any detailed discus
sion of methods would he here out
of place, I shall content myself, in
conclusion, with touching briefly
upon a couple of inferences the im
portance of which will, I trust, be
field to justify the emphasis I de
sire to throw upon them.
The broad view which I have
throughout taken of our university
responsibilities rests, of course, upon
an equally broad conception of the
literary training which it is one of
our chief objects to afford ; and
this in turn implies a distinction
between general literary culture on
the one hand, and what we techni
cally call scholarship on the other.
Here, then, in the University we
who deal witn literature have a
two-fold duty resting upon us — to
train the few as specialists, and to
help the many in the higher cul
ture of their lives ; and I maintain
that in our curriculum we should
keep these separate ends separately
in view. The future specialist
must rightly be asked to spend

j many laborious hours among minor
writers and relatively uninteresting
periods, in lines of minute investi
gation, in questions of detailed
| classification and analysis. But
meanwhile the general student
comes to us with but little energy
i available for a subject which for him
belongs now and will always be
long to the margin of his activities.
Well, under the circumstances

we cannot hope to make a scholar
of him ; we can at best give him
only a smattering of knowledge, an
imperfect conception of critical me
thods and results ; and while we
are doing this by putting him
through some part of the routine
adapted to the specialist, we are
wasting time which might be more
profitably spent in other ways,and,
it is more than probable, are culti
vating a false idea of literature and
a habit of mind which will present
ly be not helpful but injurious.
Professor Minto was right in as
serting that the study of English
literature could be made for all
students as severe a discipline as
the study of the classics; but he was
also right in adding that in the vast
majority of cases people are not
apt to find much subsequent satis
faction in the things which have
been used mainly as a training for
their minds. And in the vast ma
jority of cases, not mental discipline
purchased at the price of disen
chantment, but the development of
a large and living interest in litera
ture, is the mark at which we
should aim. How is it, I have
often been forced to ask myself,
that we often find such a fresh
spontaneous delight in literature
among men and women who have
never been through our university
courses ; while among so many who
havehad the advantage of our criti
cal drill and direction increased
knowledge has brought with it
apathy and indifference ? Mow is
it that while the student may know
so much more about a play of
Shakspere's, it is the outsider who
still, in a broad human way, feels
its passion and its power the more
intensely and thus gets really so
! much more out of it? We must
j admit that there is something rad
ically wrong somewhere when the
i academic study of literature is so
frequently equivalent to intellect
ual vaccination : one has a slight
attack, superinduced by artificial
means, and is thereby safeguarded
from any serious trouble of the
same kind in times to come. The
evil, I am bold to say, is largely

due to the wholesale sacrifice of
general culture to special scholar
ship ; and this, again, is in great
measure the outcome of the en
croachment upon literature of the
scientific spirit. We hear over
much novv-a-days of the need of
studying literature scientifically.
Now this notion of studying litera
ture scientifically means either
something which is neither very
new nor very remarkable, or some
thing against which it is our duty
to enter a vigorous protest. If it
means that in dealing with litera
ture and the history of literature,
we must he careful to know our
facts, see them steadily, set them in
their proper relationships, then no
one would complain : all this, I say,
is neither very new nor very re
markable. But if, on the other
hand, it means that the analytical
spirit and method of science — the
laboratory spirit and method — are
to he applied to the subject-matter
of literature, — if it means this, and
the consequent abandonment of the
true spirit and method of literature
itself —then surely the time has
come for those of us who believe in
literature as much as we believe in
science, to place ourselves at the
doors of our lecture-rooms, and
courageously bar the way. Litera
ture is not science, any more than
science is literature ; and the true
lines of approach to one and the
other subject differ as widely as the
aims and purposes of the subjects
themselves. Why, then, the scienti
fic study of literature, any more
than the literary study of science ?
As we demand the scientific study
of science, so we demand the liter
ary study of literature ; and the
literary study of literature means
something more than scholarship
— something more than the most
minute and accurate knowledge of
books, writers, dates, influences, the
evolution of forms and schools ; it
means the reaching of the brain

and soul of ail author and his work.
We may freely admit the practical
difficulty to which we are intro
duced when we conceive the matter
thus ;'for you may get twenty teach
ers of scientific method and scho
larship for one who himself feels
the inner spirit of literature and
has the power of bringing others to
feel it with him. But, all practi
cal difficulty notwithstanding, the
true ideals of literary culture
must still he setup in our lecture
rooms if our work there is to he
filled with the real life of thespirit,
and if we are to do our part in help
ing forward the higher civilization
of the great outer world.

Of all forms of mistake, (Jeorge
Eliot somewhere remarks, prophecy
is the most gratuitous. With such
a word of warning well in mind, I
would not wish to make this an oc
casion for indulging myself in any
rash predictions concerning what,
in the way of literature, the future
may or may not have in store. But
for those of us whose business it is
to pay some attention to the social
and intellectual conditions which,
at different times in the world's
history, have favored the free and
effective play of artistic genius, it
is only natural, 1 suppose, to turn
analysis occasionally from the
things of the past upon the circum
stances of our own time and place.
And if, as a result of such analysis,we
are led to speculate a litte curiously
on the possibility of fresh artistic
developments in years to come, we
may perhaps be allowed to do so
without protest, on the understand
ing that we are concerned only with
possibilities, and that we fully rec
ognize how frequently in such mat
ters the most carefully formed
hypotheses may he brought to
naught by the sudden irruption of
factors which have eluded scrutiny
or defied formulation.
Unless the signs of the times are
altogether misleading, therefore, I i
cannot but feel we have legiti
mate cause to believe that in the
not far distant future we may wit
ness, here on the Pacific Coast, the
beginnings of a literary movement
as distinct in character, as racy,
and in its kind as interesting and
valuable as that which, by the
middle of our century, had won
abiding glory for New England.
For here—as the most superficial
observation of the facts and condi-1
tions of California life should suf
fice to show us —the creative artist
of tomorrow — be he poet, novelist,
or dramatist- will find himself in
a new world of rare and splendid
opportunity. Think for a moment
of the stirring story of our still im
mediate past: —a story teeming with
records of adventure, of turbulence,
and violence, and conflict, of prim
itive passions, of bizarre achieve
ments and failures, of dramatic
crises, and the gradual building of
social order out of lawlessness and
confusion. There surely is a mass i
of moving incident and picturesque'
character as genuinely romantic
and as profoundly human as that
upon which the genius of Scott was
privileged to draw in the history
and legends of the Border. Nor
will the social field of today prove
a whit less fertile in theme and in
spiration. We have only to note
the striking vigor and diversity of
our western life—the cosmopolitan
ism which has resulted both from
the clash and from the blending of
races —the startling contrasts in
social types and ideals —the fresh
ness of the manhood and woman
hood fostered by our abounding
personal freedom and lack of con
ventional restraints ; -we have only
to note these things to realize that
we have here, indeed, ready to
hand, the raw material for nniny a
rich unwritten chapter in the peren

nial comedie kumaine. Moreover,
in reckoning up conditions, we must
not forget the stimulating qualities
of our mental atmosphere itself.
No one, born and bred in other en
vironments, can live for a few years
in California without remarking
upon the intellectual traits which
characterize the younger genera
tions here —upon their eagerness,
curiosity, expansiveness, generous
sympathies, quick perception, and
instructive response to art. An
artist depends largely upon his
public; and to live in so bracing
an intellectual climate must count
for not a little in his work. And
finally, in the fact that we are here
comparatively free from some of
the cramping influences of puritan-

ism, we may venture to emphasize
another element, which should con
duce somewhat — perhaps materi
ally —to the large and liberal ex
pression of artistic power.
Let it We understood that, in
speaking in this way, I am not ac
cepting, even in its most general
application, Taine's famous and
much-abused formula of the race,
the milieu, and the moment. No
such formula—no formula of any
kind—will explain genius, or ac
count satisfactorily for its manifes
tations ; nor will the closest study
of intellectual conditions and social
forces enable us to indicate before
hand what form any new literature
will take, or whether, indeed, there
will be any new literature worth
talking about. After all, when the
so-called scientific—which is more
often than not a merely pseudo
scientific— method of investigating
literary phenomena, has done its

utmost, it still remains true that,
no matter how favorable the condi
tions, how rich the soil, how keen
the intellectual atmosphere, where
no great poet happens to be born,
we shall have no great poetry;
where no great novelist or dramatist
appears, we shall have no great fic
tion or drama. The wind bloweth
where it listeth.and we must await
the rise of the Creator, the true
maker, and be content to recognize
in his coming what for us must re
main—l do not baulk the word—a
miracle, all our philosophic formu
las notwithstanding. All 1 insist
upon is, that given the literary
genius, the man of insight and cre
ative power, then existing condi
tions here should in many ways be

distinctly favorable to his growth
and free expression. Heine once
remarked that ;i man should he
very careful in the choice of his
parents. In likewise, a poet or
novelist should he very careful
about the place and time of his ap
pearance upon this planet. And a
poet or novelist might certainly do
worse than to get himself born .-it
the moment in California, where,as
I have argued, he will find ample
stimulus and opportunity to work
out whatever power may he in him.
It is natural, therefore, that we,
whose privilege it is to help to
mould in some degree the destinies
of the rising generations, should
look with interest at these various
indications of possible future lit
erary activity, and that such in
terest should be particularly keen
in the case of those of us whose own
work lies on the literary side of the
higher education. And with us, at

all events, this interest is bound to
partake of a practical character.
Noting the signs as we must, and
speculating as we may upon their
value and significance, we are also
led to ask ourselves what we may
personally do—what the University
as an organ and center of culture
may do—to aid and direct the
fores out of which the literary
movements of the future will take
their rise.
In venturing to offer some sug
gestions by way of answer to this
question, 1 may conveniently begin
by laying stress 011 the fact that the
literary influence of the University
and its curriculum will necessarily
be almost wholly critical and dis
ciplinary in its character, By this
I mean that we, within academic
walls, must not nourish the illusory
hope of helping to any extent to
develop the creative spirit, or to
furnish productive strength and
quickening power. Indeed, I will
go so far as to assert that the atti
tude toward literature which is so
sedulously cultivated in our class
rooms, and which it is the main
part of our purpose to cultivate, is,
and always must he, the reverse of
favorable to creative effort. Ob
serve, that I do not now refer to the
unfortunate results which follow
when literature is badly taught—
results which are indeed common
enough, because literature is often
badly taught, but which are none
the less due to abuses in method
and system, and, as such, are not
inevitable. That many young men
and women go out from our col
leges. as many boys and girls go
out from our schools, not only with
out the slightest real apprehension
of the spirit and meaning of the
great masterpieces to which they
have been introduced, but even with
a positive aversion to such master
pieces. is of course a fact to be
deeply deplored. Hut such must
continue to be the main upshot of
our classroom training wherever
the reading of a great piece of lit
erature is made primarily a drill in
linguistics, a course is textual crit
icism, an occasion for the pouring
in of all sorts of general knowledge
—so long, in a word, as the true
ends of literary culture are delib
erately or ignorantly sacrificed to
the ends of so-called—and often
miscalled — scholarship. But all
such evil consequences of the grind
ing of the academic mills—Which,
like the mills of God, grind slowly,
but exceeding small — belong, as J
have said, to the region of abuses
only, and, therefore, need not now
detain us. The point that I now
wish to make goes deeper, and takes
us down to the first principles of
all our academic study of letters.
For, as a matter not of choice, but
of necessity, practically our whole
effort in the classroom is expended
in the training and strengthening
of the critical faculties —our point
of view throughout is the purely
critical pointof view. This cannot,
so far as 1 see, be otherwise. Yet
what is the result ? Literature
conies unavoidably to be regarded
by teachers whose lives are given
up entirely to this point of view,
and therefore by the students who
are brought under their influence,
as a caput mortuum for analysis

and dissection. We go to work
with carefully elaborated methods,
and in the spirit of the disinter
ested scientific inquirer ; we probe,
arrange, classify, generalize, for
mulate ; we discuss environment,
cause and affect, action and reac
tion, influences, schools. Far be it
from me to say that all these things
have not their place and value ;
though it is hard enough sometimes,
in the conduct of our investigations,
to make sure that the finer spirit,
the essential life, the delicate aroma
of literature, do not escape us in
the process. But l.do insist that
all this minute and painstaking
analytic study can at best be of
little service when it comes to the
actual making of literature, and
may sometimes be therein a positive
obstacle. We are only dealing with
commonplaces when we assert that
in the history of literature the crit
ical spirit has been hostile to cre
ative power; and, though no one
would deny that there are many
individual instances in which crit
ical spirit and creative power have
been combined, still, in the average
of cases, the cultivation of the one
must be at the expense of theother.
And as, in our classroom work, our
temper is critical, our standpoint
critical, I conceive that 1 have fully
justified my perhaps rather startling
proposition that the issue of our
labors is, and must necessarily be,
the reverse of favorable to creative
effort.
But all this is, after all, only the
negative view of our academic du
ties, privileges, and responsibilities.
To reach the positive view we have
only to consider the complementary
aspect of our general statement.
For if we say that our work must
be in the main critical and disci
plinary in character, what do we
imply by such a declaration? We
imply, to begin with, that we may
do much to guide and regulate cre
ative genius ; to prevent it from
stultifying itself by errors of judg
ment and mistaken ideals ; to save
it from wasting effort in fruitless
experiments. It has been well said
that an ordinary music-master may
be of much service even to an em
bryo Mozart by pointing out to him
certain things that he must not do,
and so holding him on the high
road to true achievement. And we
imply, moreover, that while we
may do this for the creative artist
himself, we may also aid him and
his work greatly in indirect ways
by our uplifting and enlightening
influence upon the reading public
to which he will make his appeal.
In estimating the duty which the
university owes to society in the
matter of literary culture, I should
say then that it is a large part of
our business to train up, and pass
out into the world, year by year, a
body of good, intelligent, apprecia
tive, and judicious readers, capable
of discriminating between the real
and the meretricious in literature,
and thus of rating the books which
are put before them at something
like their real worth.
Here, then, we reach a point de
serving the strongest emphasis. The
knowledge of literature and of the
history of literature, the clear in
sight and the critical judgment,
which it is our aim, in the Univer
sity classroom, to give and foster,
should yield that culture which in
itself is full of saving grace. In
other words, our ambition must be
to cultivate within our students,
through sympathetic contact with
the greatest and best things in the
literature of the world, a permanent
and high standard of artistic values
—a standard to which all literature
whatsoever may be brought for test.

Because in literature there are no
tinal objective criteria to refer to, it
is sometimes idly supposed that we
can have no stable or trustworthy
criteria at all : —it is all subjective,
we are told ; artistic excellence is
this to me and that to t.hee, and
there the matter must rest. Hut
in fact there is no more reason for
deciding questions of art upon the
opinion of the man in the street,
than there is for allowing him the
last word on questions of astronomy
or biology. Anolate France, vig
orously insisting that all literary
judgments must be merely personal,
once roundly declared that a critic,
to be honest, should say—not,
Gentlemen, I am to speak to you
about Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere ; but, Gentlemen, I am to
speak to you about myself in rela
tion to Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere. Within certain limits, 1
conceive this to be perfectly true.
But is there no distinction to be
made between the verdict of the
literary scholar, when he speaks of
himself in relation to Racine, Pas
cal, Shakspere, and that, let us say,
of the half-educated journalist man
ufacturing an article to order upon
himself in relation to the thinker or
the playwright ? Formal answer
to such a question is surely un
necessary. Though we may admit
the impossibility of establishing
exact objective touchstones, which
will be in the hands of the specialist,
but of which the ordinary individ
ual will know little or nothing—
though we must thus reject any
attempt to put our judgments on
the firm foundations of a science,
we are not, therefore, to regard crit
icism as reduced to anarchy —to a
chaos of feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. We insist upon the
fundamental differences in value
among feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. Jf the scientist re
fuses to take the conclusions of the
first man he meets concerning the
evidence for or against the trans
mission of acquired characters, we
just as emphatically refuse to take
the conclusions of the first man we
meet about the relative importance
of the novels of Jane Austen and
Archibald C. Gunter, or the worth
and significance of the writings of
Charles Lamb or Walter Pater.
No more in literature than in science
are we prepared to accept manhood
suffrage, and settle things by plebis
cite. Only those who know liter
ature in a large and generous way,
who have been in personal com
munion with the great writers of the
past and present, who have consid
ered, analyzed, compared, whose
perception has thus been trained,
whose judgment has thus been
matured —only such are really en
titled to a hearing in matters where
issues of artistic valuation are in
volved. Well, it is part of our duty
in the university to leaven the
reading mass of the public—the vo
racious, untrained, uncritical public
—with the leaven of the higher
culture, and so to send out into
society —not only through teachers
and journalists, but also in the
various walks of private life —lines
of influence which shall help to
raise the general taste, and thus
count positively for good.
Noting all this in a broad way,
we will now try to indicate one or
two special directions in which, as
regards both writers and their read
ers, such culture should be made to
tell.
One considerable danger by which
we who live in California are con
tinually threatened is the danger
which arises from our isolation. In
what ways this isolation affects for
ill the general life of the State, this

is not the place to inquire. Our
concern is simply with its bearings
upon literature ; and in literature,
its evil tendencies are sufficiently
marked. These may be summed
up in the one word —Provincial-
ism,—provincialism, with its ac
companying narrowness of aim and
purpose, of understanding and sym
pathy. Insularity, the French crit
ics are fond of insisting, is always
the prison of art ; and provin
cialism, it would be well for
us to remember, is only another
name for insularity. One would
have supposed that, at this time
of day, people would begin to
realize that the intellectual wel
fare and progress of any com
munity are best guaranteed and
subserved by broad, direct, and
constant contact with the thought
and feeling of the great outer world.
Yet so far is this from being our
case, that here provincialism is de
liberately fostered by the newspa
pers, and by a number of well
meaning but short-sighted theorists
who seem to regard aloofness, self
involution, and intellectual clan
nishness as the one certain means
of insuring individual independ
ence and free personal growth. In
this way we are asked to resuscitate
the exploded ideals of the days of
the Barlows and the Dwights, when,
as a protest against hated British
tyranny, the American writer
sought to break loose altogether
from British literary tradition in
style, method, even orthography ;
we are asked to repeat the demand
of Mr. Hathaway, in " Kaavnagh,"
for a "national literature" which
shall be "altogether shaggy and
unshorn " ; we are asked to adopt
the worst errors of Walt Whitman,
who, in order to show his dem
ocratic vigor and Americanism,
made wild critical assaults upon
Shakspere and Tennyson, and, with
a loud " go to !" set himself to man
ufacture, out of hand, a new litera
ture, fresh in principle,and without
indebtedness to the past. It is ade
quate literary culture that must save
us from such follies in the future,
as it was adequate literary culture —
in the person of Oliver Wendell
Holmes and a few other influential
men of the time —that saved Ainer
tcan literature from them half a
century ago. " I remember," says
Holmes' biographer, Mr. John T.
Morse, " I remember once hearing
a gentleman of some reputation in
literature say —actually in address
ing the Board of Overseers of a dis
tinguished seat of learning—that
he did not approve of teaching
young men to write 'good English,'
to use words accurately, and to
construct sentences gramatically ;
on the contrary, he said that he
wanted an infusion of the wild,
rough inaccuracies of the great new
West! He was," Mr. Morse con
tinues, " the victim of a foolish
notion, that one of the available
ways to show 'American independ
ence of England,' was by devising
a degraded dialect of the English
language for use in the United
States Nor was he alone in this
feeling . . . ; there was for a
while a wild pseudo-literary fad in
this direction. Dr. Holmes looked
upon it with disgust and indigna
tion, making his opinions known
with his usual outspoken courage,
and exemplifying them by his own
action, with the result that he was
for a while subjected to some abuse."
If today we all recognize the bene
ficial influence of Holmes' con
servatism, we should equally recog
nize the important part which such
conservatism —the conservatism of
culture —has still to play, particu
larly in our own western world.

I would not have it supposed that
I overlook the meaning and value
of provincialism, or fail to appre
ciate what is vital and significant,
for example, beneath the strain,
the conscious posturings, the affecta
tions and perversities of Whitman's
work. Literary history shows
clearly enough that, during periods
which tend to formalism and con
vention, provincialism has often
done splendid work by bringing
new material and new blood into
art. The provincial movement is,
for exam[de, to be reckoned one of
the potent generative forces in the
romantic developments of the latter
half of the eighteenth century. Hut
literary history also shows with
equal clearness how futile and un
profitable provincialism always be
comes when it rests mainly on its
sense of newness and isolation —
when it refuses to relate itseif in
direct and healthy contact with
the best things in the world outside
and the transmitted culture of by
gone ages. Many a man of real
genius and promise has fallen short
of effective utterance by wandering
off after some spectral ambition of
originality ; many a fresh move
ment has come to naught because
it has cut itself loose from culture,
and has sought its purpose and its
field in narrow aims and parochial
interests. One of our younger gen
eration of writers has constituted
himself the spokesman and evan
gelist of what lie calls the libera
tion of the "great West." Accord
ing to him, the first important
thing for the "great West" to do
in literature is—to get itself "eman
cipated." Incidentally we might
suggest that the first important
thing for the "great West," or for
any other part of the world, to do
in literature, is to write great books ;
and that it is extremely doubtful
whether any really valuable output
of literature was ever yet heralded
or helped by clamorous and hys
terical demands for emancipation.
Hut these are points which we may
at present leave undiscussed. Con
cerning what Mr. Hamlin Garland
means by emancipation, however,
we need not remain in doubt. The
day of the East —the day of foreign
influence, according to him —is over,
or should be over. In this fact
lies our hope of "emancipation."
The past —the phrase is bis own
"is not vital " ; we must abandon
-the phrase is again his own—its
"crumbling idols"; we must break
once and for all with its traditions,
methods, usages. Now all this is
simply provincialism run mad —
fanatical provincialism, asserting
its own unreason and rejoicing in
it. Let the " great West " manifest
its spirit in literature, by all means;
let it find its own way ; let it
deal freshly with its magnificent
fresh material ; let it build its own
edifice, if necessary, in its own
chosen style of architecture. If it
succeeds, it will succeed because its
work is good, sound, valid —not be
cause it is wrought in an anti-feudal
spirit, or with any dogmatic inten
tion of "emancipating" itself from
anything or anybody. Hut we may
be sure of this —that such work will
not lie done the better or the more
effectively —that it will never be
helped, and may be seriously
marred, and even invalidated—by
being conceived in a boastful tem
per, and planned and carried
through in reckless ignorance of
what has succeeded and what
has failed in the past. When
Mr. Garland himself gives us his
stories of prairie life, we are in
terested, we are moved and stirred,
not because they are examples of
"emancipated" literature, but be
cause, after all, they have in them
some measure of the true life which
has secured pemanence and univer
sality —for all literature worth the
name, from the Book of Job
and the Homeric Epos down
to "The Man Who Was"and
" Madame Delphine." The first
and last aim of the artist
should be to endue his own work
with something of this true life. If
he fail to do so, of what service to
him or to us will be his Declaration
of Independence? If he succeed,
he need not trouble himself about
"emancipation," and rest assured
that we, his readers, will not trouble
ourselves about it in our turn.
What a relief it is, then, to turn
from the crude dogmatism of Mr.
Garland to the wise words of one
who knows literature as a scholar
and feels it as a poet. " Shakspere's
creations," writes Mr. Stedman,
"have been pronounced outworn"
—Shakspere being, of course, one of
the "crumbling idols" handed down
to us from a past which is not
"vital"—"have been pronounced
outworn, because he was the last
great 'poet of feudalism.' We
might as well say that the truth to
human life displayed in Genesis or
Exodus, or the synthetic beauty of
the Parthenon, or the glory (if the
Sistine Madonna, will grow inef
fective, forgetting that these have
the vitality which appertains to the
lasting nature of things. No poet
can ever outrival Shakspere"—can
ever take the place of that "crum
bling idol " —" except by a more ex
ceeding insight and utterance. It is
well said that great art is always
modern." And again, with what
pleasure do we acknowledge the
admirable common sense of some
remarks of another critical master
(who in such matters rarely fails to
hit the mark), concerning the so
called "Irish literary movement,"
which once again is only another
illustration of the outworkings of
the spirit of Provincialism. "J
confess," says Professor Dowden,
"that I am not ambitious of inten
sifying my intellectual or spiritual
brogue. . . . No folly can be
greater than that of fancying
that we shall strengthen our lit
erary position by living exclu
sively in our own ideas" —
that is, by "emancipating" our
selves —"and showing ourselves in
hospitable to the best ideas of other
lands" —and, we may add, of that
great past, which, the "emanci
pated" tell us, is no longer "vital."
And Professor Dowden adds one
most significant remark. "Every
great literary movement of modern
Kurope," be reminds us, "has been
born from the wedlock of two peo
ples." Should not this fact suggest
to us —to those of us, at all events,
who are not so thoroughly emanci
pated as to care nothing for the
teachings of history—that complete
emancipation might after all mean
— complete sterility ?
Hut if we need emancipation, it
is surely emancipation from such
clogging and paralyzing provincial
ism ; and this emancipation we
should help to accomplish in the
university classroom, and by uni
versity culture. Knowledge of the
best in literature that the world
has produced—the fineness of in
sight and the certainty of taste
which are developed by personal
contact with the vital and enduring
elements in the great books of past
and present: these things are what
we need always and everywhere—
and need more than ever today
and here in California—if we would
save ourselves from the perversion
of effort and the waste of power. A
man who has learned to appreciate

and feel what its vital and enduring
in the literature of Greece, England,
Italy, France, Germany —who has
been brought, let us say, under the
discipline of Sophocles, Shakspere,
Dante, Voltaire, Goethe —will have
been swept so far into the great
main current of culture, that he
will be in little danger of being
caught up in momentary eddies, or
washed into obscure backwater of
the stream. In such a school, we
learn to see things in their right
relations, estimate them by true
and permanent standards of value,
and put them into their proper
places.
And how sadly the power to do
this is needed just at present is
made manifest when we observe
the terrible lack of any sense of
proportion and perspective ex
hibited in newspaper reviews,
in magazine articles, in com
mon judgments about books and
authors hastily struck out in
conversation or more deliberately
registered in print. Look for a
moment at our whole modern
business of book-reviewing—note
its conspicuous short-comings—and
ask honestly what for the most part
it is really worth. I do not wish
to seem hard or querulous in my
censure; but in its more popular
forms, at any rate, is it for the most
part really worth anything at all ?
A reviewer, in virtue of his official
position, is supposed (and if this
be but a supposition, then so much
the worse for thefact) —is supposed
to guide and check public opinion
about things of which he is sup
posed (and again if this be but a
supposition, then so much the worse
for the fact), to know more than
the general reader ; it is, by the
hypothesis, his special function to
offer opinions which will help, di
rect, enlighten. Hut in the larger
proportion of cases, is this function
fultilled ? Does the magazine ar
ticle, does the newspaper criticism,
really guide or check, help, direct,
enlighten ? To put the question
in this downright fashion is surely
to answer it. And the worst aspect
of the matter is not, after all, that
article and criticism are so often
evidently the work of men who do
not in the least understand what
they are talking about. That is
bad enough, of course ; but the as
sertions of mere ignorance are, 1
take it, less subtly and less con
stantly dangerous than the distor
tion of critical vision commonly
exhibited even by men who take
their work seriously, write with
more than ordinary care, and show
a laudable desire to say something
to the point. A new novel is pub
lished —a book perhaps with many
admirable qualities and well de
serving a word of cordial recogni
tion. We turn to a notice of it in
a paper or magazine, and we find
the reviewer almost beside himself
in a frenzy of wonder and excite
ment. The work is hailed as a mas
terpiece, the author pronounced on
the spot a writer beside whom—if
we are to take his language at its
liberal meaning—Scott, Balzac,
Thackeray, are as prattling chil
dren. A year or two goes by ; the
great book and the great author
disappear from sight, or drop back
into the rank of the ephemerals;
and the critic, who seems never to
learn by experience, cheerfully and
unblushingiy breaks forth into an
other paeon over the arrival of an
other masterpiece, from the pen of
another genius ot the first, order.
What, we say in our confusion, is
it possible that there are really so
many Scotts, and Balzacs, and
Thackerays about ? Does the spread
of democracy mean that hereafter

geniuses are to l>e plenty as black
berries ? Or why all this fuss ?
And then we recall Browning's
legate who had lived to see —and
see out —four and twenty leaders of
revolt. But though there are moods
in which we may find passing
amusement in the situation, it is
but passing amusement, after all.
For if we are truly in earnest about
literature, all this laxity of critical
opinion must necessarily alarm us,
since we cannot blind ourselves
to the danger—the great and se
rious danger — inherent in our
wholesale abandonment of high
standards and the consequent vitia
tion of public tas-te. And where,
we ask, is any corrective to be
sought ? It must be sought in such
knowledge and insight as are given,
in such discipline and breadth of
view as are afforded, by the culture
of the university classroom. It is
not, indeed, to be argued that any
amount of university training will
of itself make a reviewer conscien
tious in the performance of his diffi
cult and sometimes delicate duty—
especially in these days when even
reputable publishers seek to bias
his mind and "inspire" his utter
ances. But such training will most
certainly give some sense of meas
ure, some feeling fur proportion,
some realization of what has and
what has not substantial claims
upon attention ; and in virtue of
these gains, a man's work as critic,
as leader of opinion, will neces
sarily become more temperate, more
intelligent, more helpful.
And to the culture and training
of the university classroom again,
we have mainly to look for a much
needed check upon yet another ten
dency of our time more widespread
and more generally pernicious than
any yet referred to. The evil of
which we now come to speak is not
local, or of sudden growth ; it per
vades almost the entire reading
world ; and it has developed grad
ually out of the changing social
conditions of the past fifty or sixty
years. I have in mind,as you will
have anticipated, the enormous re
cent growth of periodical litera
ture, and the intellectual results
which are now beginning to be rec
ognized as arising from our ever
increasing dependence upon it.
Ours is, we are often told, em
phatically a, reading age. 1 do not
deny this; indeed, if we consider
only the number of lines of print
per capita actually consumed by
our population, day by day, year
by year, no other age in history
has had such a claim to the dis
tincti >n. But it is, 1 am afraid, at
the same time an age of rapid read
ing, superficial reading, thoughtless
reading —of the kind of reading
which dissipates the energies, un
dermines the power of attention,
and plays havoc with the mind.
Coleridge long ago classed the con
stant perusal of periodicals among
anti-mnemonics, or destroyers of
memory, and looked with dread at
the growth of the magazine and
newspaper habit. If he was
alarmed, what should our feelings
be ? Step into a bookstore in the
early part of the month, and
turn over the magazines, just out,
and freshly exposed for sale, in all
the meretricious attractiveness of
elaborate covers, designed to arrest
the wandering eye. There they are
— ranged in picturesque rows —
pretentious, unpretentious—cheap,
dear —good, bad, indifferent; some
professing literary excellence—some
frankly abandoning all title to any
thing of the kind. Now, of course,
these publications vary in worth as
widely as they differ in their styles ;
and it would be unjust to lump

tliem together, and dismiss them all
with a single \rord of condemnation.
But what is the general impression
they leave upon us when we view
them in the lot ? It is not a pleas
ant impression,certainly. What a
mass of rubbish goes to the mak
ing of these monthly concoctions !
How poor —how unspeakably poor
—is, on the average, the stuff which
they set before their buyers ? How
little in any one of them are we
likely to find what will stand the
test of a second thoughtful reading !
Many of them are scarcely more
than picture-books—collections of
photogravures and the like, accom
panied by some weak explanatory
letter-press ; in most of them, again,
as is natural in an age which has
an unworthy passion for personal
ities, large space is given to portraits
of distinguished or notorious peo
ple, and to the catchpenny gossip
about them which, true or false, is
always held safe to amuse an idle
half-hour. Even, 1 grieve to say,
in our so-called literary magazines
—in periodicals directly devoted to
literature and its interests — the
same childish tendencies are to be
found encroaching on every side.
Here, too, we have not only ac
counts of new publications, and the
information we properly desire to
gain about current affairs in the
book world ; we have also pictures
of all the new rivals of Scott, Balzac,
and Thackeray—of their fathers,
mothers, uncles, and aunts —of
their places of birth and residence
— facsimiles from their manu
scripts, scraps from their letters,
and details innumerable about their
private lives and methods of work
—whether, for instance, they are
married or single, write the more
fluently before breakfast or at mid
night, prefer coffee or tea, golfing or
boating —with other such matter
of manifest importance in the
study of their books. All this is
positively painful. And if a little
serious consideration of our maga
zines fills ns with misapprehen
sion, what shall we say about
our newspapers ? —about our Sun
day newspapers particularly, which
themselves aspire to take rank as
magazines? What shall we say?
Perhaps it will be safest not to at
tempt to say anything. It would
be hard to do justice to such a
subject.
The bearings of our growing habit
of miscellaneous reading upon our
mental life and through this upon
real literature, have been admirably
described by a couple of writers,
whose words will carry so much
more weight than my own, that I
will ask you to listen to them in my
behalf.
Says Charles Dudley Warner : —
"The habit of excessive newspaper
reading, in which a great variety of
topics is inadequately treated, has
a curious effect on the mind. It
becomes demoralized, gradually
loses the power of concentration
or of continuous thought, and even
loses the inclination to read the
long articles which the newspaper
prints. The eye catches a thousand
things, but is detained by no
one. . . . The effect of this
scrappy desultory reading is bad
enough when the hashed compound
selected is tolerably good. It be
comes a very serious matter when
the reading itself is vapid, frivolous,
or bad. The responsibility of se
lecting the mental food for millions
of people is serious. When, in the
last century, in England, the So
ciety for the Diffusion of Useful In
formation, which accomplished so
much good, was organized, this re
sponsibility was felt, and competent
hands prepared the popular books
and pamphlets. . . . Now, it
happens that a hundred thousand
people, perhaps a million in some
cases, surrender the right of the all
important selection of food for their
minds to some unknown and irre
sponsible person whose business it
is to choose the miscellaneous read
ing-matter for a particular news-

paper. His or her taste may he
good, or it may he immature and
vicious ; it may he used simply to
create a sensation ; and yet the
million of readers get nothing ex
cept what this one person chooses
they shall read . . . Day after
day, Sunday after Sunday, they
read only what this unknown per
son selects for them. Instead of
going to the library and cultivating
their own tastes, and pursuing some
subject that will increase their
mental vigor and add to their per
manent stock of thought, they frit
ter away their time upon a hash of
literature chopped up for them by
a person possibly very unfit even
to make a good hash. The mere
statement of this surrender of one's
judgment of what shall be his in
tellectual life, is alarming."
1 have now indicated a few of
the directions in which the aca
demic study of literature should lie
made to count in the interests of
literature itself. It might perhaps
be expected that I should now say
something about the hearings of my
arguments upon our own classroom
work. Hut as any detailed discus
sion of methods would he here out
of place, I shall content myself, in
conclusion, with touching briefly
upon a couple of inferences the im
portance of which will, I trust, be
field to justify the emphasis I de
sire to throw upon them.
The broad view which I have
throughout taken of our university
responsibilities rests, of course, upon
an equally broad conception of the
literary training which it is one of
our chief objects to afford ; and
this in turn implies a distinction
between general literary culture on
the one hand, and what we techni
cally call scholarship on the other.
Here, then, in the University we
who deal witn literature have a
two-fold duty resting upon us — to
train the few as specialists, and to
help the many in the higher cul
ture of their lives ; and I maintain
that in our curriculum we should
keep these separate ends separately
in view. The future specialist
must rightly be asked to spend

j many laborious hours among minor
writers and relatively uninteresting
periods, in lines of minute investi
gation, in questions of detailed
| classification and analysis. But
meanwhile the general student
comes to us with but little energy
i available for a subject which for him
belongs now and will always be
long to the margin of his activities.
Well, under the circumstances

we cannot hope to make a scholar
of him ; we can at best give him
only a smattering of knowledge, an
imperfect conception of critical me
thods and results ; and while we
are doing this by putting him
through some part of the routine
adapted to the specialist, we are
wasting time which might be more
profitably spent in other ways,and,
it is more than probable, are culti
vating a false idea of literature and
a habit of mind which will present
ly be not helpful but injurious.
Professor Minto was right in as
serting that the study of English
literature could be made for all
students as severe a discipline as
the study of the classics; but he was
also right in adding that in the vast
majority of cases people are not
apt to find much subsequent satis
faction in the things which have
been used mainly as a training for
their minds. And in the vast ma
jority of cases, not mental discipline
purchased at the price of disen
chantment, but the development of
a large and living interest in litera
ture, is the mark at which we
should aim. How is it, I have
often been forced to ask myself,
that we often find such a fresh
spontaneous delight in literature
among men and women who have
never been through our university
courses ; while among so many who
havehad the advantage of our criti
cal drill and direction increased
knowledge has brought with it
apathy and indifference ? Mow is
it that while the student may know
so much more about a play of
Shakspere's, it is the outsider who
still, in a broad human way, feels
its passion and its power the more
intensely and thus gets really so
! much more out of it? We must
j admit that there is something rad
ically wrong somewhere when the
i academic study of literature is so
frequently equivalent to intellect
ual vaccination : one has a slight
attack, superinduced by artificial
means, and is thereby safeguarded
from any serious trouble of the
same kind in times to come. The
evil, I am bold to say, is largely

due to the wholesale sacrifice of
general culture to special scholar
ship ; and this, again, is in great
measure the outcome of the en
croachment upon literature of the
scientific spirit. We hear over
much novv-a-days of the need of
studying literature scientifically.
Now this notion of studying litera
ture scientifically means either
something which is neither very
new nor very remarkable, or some
thing against which it is our duty
to enter a vigorous protest. If it
means that in dealing with litera
ture and the history of literature,
we must he careful to know our
facts, see them steadily, set them in
their proper relationships, then no
one would complain : all this, I say,
is neither very new nor very re
markable. But if, on the other
hand, it means that the analytical
spirit and method of science — the
laboratory spirit and method — are
to he applied to the subject-matter
of literature, — if it means this, and
the consequent abandonment of the
true spirit and method of literature
itself —then surely the time has
come for those of us who believe in
literature as much as we believe in
science, to place ourselves at the
doors of our lecture-rooms, and
courageously bar the way. Litera
ture is not science, any more than
science is literature ; and the true
lines of approach to one and the
other subject differ as widely as the
aims and purposes of the subjects
themselves. Why, then, the scienti
fic study of literature, any more
than the literary study of science ?
As we demand the scientific study
of science, so we demand the liter
ary study of literature ; and the
literary study of literature means
something more than scholarship
— something more than the most
minute and accurate knowledge of
books, writers, dates, influences, the
evolution of forms and schools ; it
means the reaching of the brain

and soul of ail author and his work.
We may freely admit the practical
difficulty to which we are intro
duced when we conceive the matter
thus ;'for you may get twenty teach
ers of scientific method and scho
larship for one who himself feels
the inner spirit of literature and
has the power of bringing others to
feel it with him. But, all practi
cal difficulty notwithstanding, the
true ideals of literary culture
must still he setup in our lecture
rooms if our work there is to he
filled with the real life of thespirit,
and if we are to do our part in help
ing forward the higher civilization
of the great outer world.

Of all forms of mistake, (Jeorge
Eliot somewhere remarks, prophecy
is the most gratuitous. With such
a word of warning well in mind, I
would not wish to make this an oc
casion for indulging myself in any
rash predictions concerning what,
in the way of literature, the future
may or may not have in store. But
for those of us whose business it is
to pay some attention to the social
and intellectual conditions which,
at different times in the world's
history, have favored the free and
effective play of artistic genius, it
is only natural, 1 suppose, to turn
analysis occasionally from the
things of the past upon the circum
stances of our own time and place.
And if, as a result of such analysis,we
are led to speculate a litte curiously
on the possibility of fresh artistic
developments in years to come, we
may perhaps be allowed to do so
without protest, on the understand
ing that we are concerned only with
possibilities, and that we fully rec
ognize how frequently in such mat
ters the most carefully formed
hypotheses may he brought to
naught by the sudden irruption of
factors which have eluded scrutiny
or defied formulation.
Unless the signs of the times are
altogether misleading, therefore, I i
cannot but feel we have legiti
mate cause to believe that in the
not far distant future we may wit
ness, here on the Pacific Coast, the
beginnings of a literary movement
as distinct in character, as racy,
and in its kind as interesting and
valuable as that which, by the
middle of our century, had won
abiding glory for New England.
For here—as the most superficial
observation of the facts and condi-1
tions of California life should suf
fice to show us —the creative artist
of tomorrow — be he poet, novelist,
or dramatist- will find himself in
a new world of rare and splendid
opportunity. Think for a moment
of the stirring story of our still im
mediate past: —a story teeming with
records of adventure, of turbulence,
and violence, and conflict, of prim
itive passions, of bizarre achieve
ments and failures, of dramatic
crises, and the gradual building of
social order out of lawlessness and
confusion. There surely is a mass i
of moving incident and picturesque'
character as genuinely romantic
and as profoundly human as that
upon which the genius of Scott was
privileged to draw in the history
and legends of the Border. Nor
will the social field of today prove
a whit less fertile in theme and in
spiration. We have only to note
the striking vigor and diversity of
our western life—the cosmopolitan
ism which has resulted both from
the clash and from the blending of
races —the startling contrasts in
social types and ideals —the fresh
ness of the manhood and woman
hood fostered by our abounding
personal freedom and lack of con
ventional restraints ; -we have only
to note these things to realize that
we have here, indeed, ready to
hand, the raw material for nniny a
rich unwritten chapter in the peren

nial comedie kumaine. Moreover,
in reckoning up conditions, we must
not forget the stimulating qualities
of our mental atmosphere itself.
No one, born and bred in other en
vironments, can live for a few years
in California without remarking
upon the intellectual traits which
characterize the younger genera
tions here —upon their eagerness,
curiosity, expansiveness, generous
sympathies, quick perception, and
instructive response to art. An
artist depends largely upon his
public; and to live in so bracing
an intellectual climate must count
for not a little in his work. And
finally, in the fact that we are here
comparatively free from some of
the cramping influences of puritan-

ism, we may venture to emphasize
another element, which should con
duce somewhat — perhaps materi
ally —to the large and liberal ex
pression of artistic power.
Let it We understood that, in
speaking in this way, I am not ac
cepting, even in its most general
application, Taine's famous and
much-abused formula of the race,
the milieu, and the moment. No
such formula—no formula of any
kind—will explain genius, or ac
count satisfactorily for its manifes
tations ; nor will the closest study
of intellectual conditions and social
forces enable us to indicate before
hand what form any new literature
will take, or whether, indeed, there
will be any new literature worth
talking about. After all, when the
so-called scientific—which is more
often than not a merely pseudo
scientific— method of investigating
literary phenomena, has done its

utmost, it still remains true that,
no matter how favorable the condi
tions, how rich the soil, how keen
the intellectual atmosphere, where
no great poet happens to be born,
we shall have no great poetry;
where no great novelist or dramatist
appears, we shall have no great fic
tion or drama. The wind bloweth
where it listeth.and we must await
the rise of the Creator, the true
maker, and be content to recognize
in his coming what for us must re
main—l do not baulk the word—a
miracle, all our philosophic formu
las notwithstanding. All 1 insist
upon is, that given the literary
genius, the man of insight and cre
ative power, then existing condi
tions here should in many ways be

distinctly favorable to his growth
and free expression. Heine once
remarked that ;i man should he
very careful in the choice of his
parents. In likewise, a poet or
novelist should he very careful
about the place and time of his ap
pearance upon this planet. And a
poet or novelist might certainly do
worse than to get himself born .-it
the moment in California, where,as
I have argued, he will find ample
stimulus and opportunity to work
out whatever power may he in him.
It is natural, therefore, that we,
whose privilege it is to help to
mould in some degree the destinies
of the rising generations, should
look with interest at these various
indications of possible future lit
erary activity, and that such in
terest should be particularly keen
in the case of those of us whose own
work lies on the literary side of the
higher education. And with us, at

all events, this interest is bound to
partake of a practical character.
Noting the signs as we must, and
speculating as we may upon their
value and significance, we are also
led to ask ourselves what we may
personally do—what the University
as an organ and center of culture
may do—to aid and direct the
fores out of which the literary
movements of the future will take
their rise.
In venturing to offer some sug
gestions by way of answer to this
question, 1 may conveniently begin
by laying stress 011 the fact that the
literary influence of the University
and its curriculum will necessarily
be almost wholly critical and dis
ciplinary in its character, By this
I mean that we, within academic
walls, must not nourish the illusory
hope of helping to any extent to
develop the creative spirit, or to
furnish productive strength and
quickening power. Indeed, I will
go so far as to assert that the atti
tude toward literature which is so
sedulously cultivated in our class
rooms, and which it is the main
part of our purpose to cultivate, is,
and always must he, the reverse of
favorable to creative effort. Ob
serve, that I do not now refer to the
unfortunate results which follow
when literature is badly taught—
results which are indeed common
enough, because literature is often
badly taught, but which are none
the less due to abuses in method
and system, and, as such, are not
inevitable. That many young men
and women go out from our col
leges. as many boys and girls go
out from our schools, not only with
out the slightest real apprehension
of the spirit and meaning of the
great masterpieces to which they
have been introduced, but even with
a positive aversion to such master
pieces. is of course a fact to be
deeply deplored. Hut such must
continue to be the main upshot of
our classroom training wherever
the reading of a great piece of lit
erature is made primarily a drill in
linguistics, a course is textual crit
icism, an occasion for the pouring
in of all sorts of general knowledge
—so long, in a word, as the true
ends of literary culture are delib
erately or ignorantly sacrificed to
the ends of so-called—and often
miscalled — scholarship. But all
such evil consequences of the grind
ing of the academic mills—Which,
like the mills of God, grind slowly,
but exceeding small — belong, as J
have said, to the region of abuses
only, and, therefore, need not now
detain us. The point that I now
wish to make goes deeper, and takes
us down to the first principles of
all our academic study of letters.
For, as a matter not of choice, but
of necessity, practically our whole
effort in the classroom is expended
in the training and strengthening
of the critical faculties —our point
of view throughout is the purely
critical pointof view. This cannot,
so far as 1 see, be otherwise. Yet
what is the result ? Literature
conies unavoidably to be regarded
by teachers whose lives are given
up entirely to this point of view,
and therefore by the students who
are brought under their influence,
as a caput mortuum for analysis

and dissection. We go to work
with carefully elaborated methods,
and in the spirit of the disinter
ested scientific inquirer ; we probe,
arrange, classify, generalize, for
mulate ; we discuss environment,
cause and affect, action and reac
tion, influences, schools. Far be it
from me to say that all these things
have not their place and value ;
though it is hard enough sometimes,
in the conduct of our investigations,
to make sure that the finer spirit,
the essential life, the delicate aroma
of literature, do not escape us in
the process. But l.do insist that
all this minute and painstaking
analytic study can at best be of
little service when it comes to the
actual making of literature, and
may sometimes be therein a positive
obstacle. We are only dealing with
commonplaces when we assert that
in the history of literature the crit
ical spirit has been hostile to cre
ative power; and, though no one
would deny that there are many
individual instances in which crit
ical spirit and creative power have
been combined, still, in the average
of cases, the cultivation of the one
must be at the expense of theother.
And as, in our classroom work, our
temper is critical, our standpoint
critical, I conceive that 1 have fully
justified my perhaps rather startling
proposition that the issue of our
labors is, and must necessarily be,
the reverse of favorable to creative
effort.
But all this is, after all, only the
negative view of our academic du
ties, privileges, and responsibilities.
To reach the positive view we have
only to consider the complementary
aspect of our general statement.
For if we say that our work must
be in the main critical and disci
plinary in character, what do we
imply by such a declaration? We
imply, to begin with, that we may
do much to guide and regulate cre
ative genius ; to prevent it from
stultifying itself by errors of judg
ment and mistaken ideals ; to save
it from wasting effort in fruitless
experiments. It has been well said
that an ordinary music-master may
be of much service even to an em
bryo Mozart by pointing out to him
certain things that he must not do,
and so holding him on the high
road to true achievement. And we
imply, moreover, that while we
may do this for the creative artist
himself, we may also aid him and
his work greatly in indirect ways
by our uplifting and enlightening
influence upon the reading public
to which he will make his appeal.
In estimating the duty which the
university owes to society in the
matter of literary culture, I should
say then that it is a large part of
our business to train up, and pass
out into the world, year by year, a
body of good, intelligent, apprecia
tive, and judicious readers, capable
of discriminating between the real
and the meretricious in literature,
and thus of rating the books which
are put before them at something
like their real worth.
Here, then, we reach a point de
serving the strongest emphasis. The
knowledge of literature and of the
history of literature, the clear in
sight and the critical judgment,
which it is our aim, in the Univer
sity classroom, to give and foster,
should yield that culture which in
itself is full of saving grace. In
other words, our ambition must be
to cultivate within our students,
through sympathetic contact with
the greatest and best things in the
literature of the world, a permanent
and high standard of artistic values
—a standard to which all literature
whatsoever may be brought for test.

Because in literature there are no
tinal objective criteria to refer to, it
is sometimes idly supposed that we
can have no stable or trustworthy
criteria at all : —it is all subjective,
we are told ; artistic excellence is
this to me and that to t.hee, and
there the matter must rest. Hut
in fact there is no more reason for
deciding questions of art upon the
opinion of the man in the street,
than there is for allowing him the
last word on questions of astronomy
or biology. Anolate France, vig
orously insisting that all literary
judgments must be merely personal,
once roundly declared that a critic,
to be honest, should say—not,
Gentlemen, I am to speak to you
about Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere ; but, Gentlemen, I am to
speak to you about myself in rela
tion to Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere. Within certain limits, 1
conceive this to be perfectly true.
But is there no distinction to be
made between the verdict of the
literary scholar, when he speaks of
himself in relation to Racine, Pas
cal, Shakspere, and that, let us say,
of the half-educated journalist man
ufacturing an article to order upon
himself in relation to the thinker or
the playwright ? Formal answer
to such a question is surely un
necessary. Though we may admit
the impossibility of establishing
exact objective touchstones, which
will be in the hands of the specialist,
but of which the ordinary individ
ual will know little or nothing—
though we must thus reject any
attempt to put our judgments on
the firm foundations of a science,
we are not, therefore, to regard crit
icism as reduced to anarchy —to a
chaos of feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. We insist upon the
fundamental differences in value
among feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. Jf the scientist re
fuses to take the conclusions of the
first man he meets concerning the
evidence for or against the trans
mission of acquired characters, we
just as emphatically refuse to take
the conclusions of the first man we
meet about the relative importance
of the novels of Jane Austen and
Archibald C. Gunter, or the worth
and significance of the writings of
Charles Lamb or Walter Pater.
No more in literature than in science
are we prepared to accept manhood
suffrage, and settle things by plebis
cite. Only those who know liter
ature in a large and generous way,
who have been in personal com
munion with the great writers of the
past and present, who have consid
ered, analyzed, compared, whose
perception has thus been trained,
whose judgment has thus been
matured —only such are really en
titled to a hearing in matters where
issues of artistic valuation are in
volved. Well, it is part of our duty
in the university to leaven the
reading mass of the public—the vo
racious, untrained, uncritical public
—with the leaven of the higher
culture, and so to send out into
society —not only through teachers
and journalists, but also in the
various walks of private life —lines
of influence which shall help to
raise the general taste, and thus
count positively for good.
Noting all this in a broad way,
we will now try to indicate one or
two special directions in which, as
regards both writers and their read
ers, such culture should be made to
tell.
One considerable danger by which
we who live in California are con
tinually threatened is the danger
which arises from our isolation. In
what ways this isolation affects for
ill the general life of the State, this

is not the place to inquire. Our
concern is simply with its bearings
upon literature ; and in literature,
its evil tendencies are sufficiently
marked. These may be summed
up in the one word —Provincial-
ism,—provincialism, with its ac
companying narrowness of aim and
purpose, of understanding and sym
pathy. Insularity, the French crit
ics are fond of insisting, is always
the prison of art ; and provin
cialism, it would be well for
us to remember, is only another
name for insularity. One would
have supposed that, at this time
of day, people would begin to
realize that the intellectual wel
fare and progress of any com
munity are best guaranteed and
subserved by broad, direct, and
constant contact with the thought
and feeling of the great outer world.
Yet so far is this from being our
case, that here provincialism is de
liberately fostered by the newspa
pers, and by a number of well
meaning but short-sighted theorists
who seem to regard aloofness, self
involution, and intellectual clan
nishness as the one certain means
of insuring individual independ
ence and free personal growth. In
this way we are asked to resuscitate
the exploded ideals of the days of
the Barlows and the Dwights, when,
as a protest against hated British
tyranny, the American writer
sought to break loose altogether
from British literary tradition in
style, method, even orthography ;
we are asked to repeat the demand
of Mr. Hathaway, in " Kaavnagh,"
for a "national literature" which
shall be "altogether shaggy and
unshorn " ; we are asked to adopt
the worst errors of Walt Whitman,
who, in order to show his dem
ocratic vigor and Americanism,
made wild critical assaults upon
Shakspere and Tennyson, and, with
a loud " go to !" set himself to man
ufacture, out of hand, a new litera
ture, fresh in principle,and without
indebtedness to the past. It is ade
quate literary culture that must save
us from such follies in the future,
as it was adequate literary culture —
in the person of Oliver Wendell
Holmes and a few other influential
men of the time —that saved Ainer
tcan literature from them half a
century ago. " I remember," says
Holmes' biographer, Mr. John T.
Morse, " I remember once hearing
a gentleman of some reputation in
literature say —actually in address
ing the Board of Overseers of a dis
tinguished seat of learning—that
he did not approve of teaching
young men to write 'good English,'
to use words accurately, and to
construct sentences gramatically ;
on the contrary, he said that he
wanted an infusion of the wild,
rough inaccuracies of the great new
West! He was," Mr. Morse con
tinues, " the victim of a foolish
notion, that one of the available
ways to show 'American independ
ence of England,' was by devising
a degraded dialect of the English
language for use in the United
States Nor was he alone in this
feeling . . . ; there was for a
while a wild pseudo-literary fad in
this direction. Dr. Holmes looked
upon it with disgust and indigna
tion, making his opinions known
with his usual outspoken courage,
and exemplifying them by his own
action, with the result that he was
for a while subjected to some abuse."
If today we all recognize the bene
ficial influence of Holmes' con
servatism, we should equally recog
nize the important part which such
conservatism —the conservatism of
culture —has still to play, particu
larly in our own western world.

I would not have it supposed that
I overlook the meaning and value
of provincialism, or fail to appre
ciate what is vital and significant,
for example, beneath the strain,
the conscious posturings, the affecta
tions and perversities of Whitman's
work. Literary history shows
clearly enough that, during periods
which tend to formalism and con
vention, provincialism has often
done splendid work by bringing
new material and new blood into
art. The provincial movement is,
for exam[de, to be reckoned one of
the potent generative forces in the
romantic developments of the latter
half of the eighteenth century. Hut
literary history also shows with
equal clearness how futile and un
profitable provincialism always be
comes when it rests mainly on its
sense of newness and isolation —
when it refuses to relate itseif in
direct and healthy contact with
the best things in the world outside
and the transmitted culture of by
gone ages. Many a man of real
genius and promise has fallen short
of effective utterance by wandering
off after some spectral ambition of
originality ; many a fresh move
ment has come to naught because
it has cut itself loose from culture,
and has sought its purpose and its
field in narrow aims and parochial
interests. One of our younger gen
eration of writers has constituted
himself the spokesman and evan
gelist of what lie calls the libera
tion of the "great West." Accord
ing to him, the first important
thing for the "great West" to do
in literature is—to get itself "eman
cipated." Incidentally we might
suggest that the first important
thing for the "great West," or for
any other part of the world, to do
in literature, is to write great books ;
and that it is extremely doubtful
whether any really valuable output
of literature was ever yet heralded
or helped by clamorous and hys
terical demands for emancipation.
Hut these are points which we may
at present leave undiscussed. Con
cerning what Mr. Hamlin Garland
means by emancipation, however,
we need not remain in doubt. The
day of the East —the day of foreign
influence, according to him —is over,
or should be over. In this fact
lies our hope of "emancipation."
The past —the phrase is bis own
"is not vital " ; we must abandon
-the phrase is again his own—its
"crumbling idols"; we must break
once and for all with its traditions,
methods, usages. Now all this is
simply provincialism run mad —
fanatical provincialism, asserting
its own unreason and rejoicing in
it. Let the " great West " manifest
its spirit in literature, by all means;
let it find its own way ; let it
deal freshly with its magnificent
fresh material ; let it build its own
edifice, if necessary, in its own
chosen style of architecture. If it
succeeds, it will succeed because its
work is good, sound, valid —not be
cause it is wrought in an anti-feudal
spirit, or with any dogmatic inten
tion of "emancipating" itself from
anything or anybody. Hut we may
be sure of this —that such work will
not lie done the better or the more
effectively —that it will never be
helped, and may be seriously
marred, and even invalidated—by
being conceived in a boastful tem
per, and planned and carried
through in reckless ignorance of
what has succeeded and what
has failed in the past. When
Mr. Garland himself gives us his
stories of prairie life, we are in
terested, we are moved and stirred,
not because they are examples of
"emancipated" literature, but be
cause, after all, they have in them
some measure of the true life which
has secured pemanence and univer
sality —for all literature worth the
name, from the Book of Job
and the Homeric Epos down
to "The Man Who Was"and
" Madame Delphine." The first
and last aim of the artist
should be to endue his own work
with something of this true life. If
he fail to do so, of what service to
him or to us will be his Declaration
of Independence? If he succeed,
he need not trouble himself about
"emancipation," and rest assured
that we, his readers, will not trouble
ourselves about it in our turn.
What a relief it is, then, to turn
from the crude dogmatism of Mr.
Garland to the wise words of one
who knows literature as a scholar
and feels it as a poet. " Shakspere's
creations," writes Mr. Stedman,
"have been pronounced outworn"
—Shakspere being, of course, one of
the "crumbling idols" handed down
to us from a past which is not
"vital"—"have been pronounced
outworn, because he was the last
great 'poet of feudalism.' We
might as well say that the truth to
human life displayed in Genesis or
Exodus, or the synthetic beauty of
the Parthenon, or the glory (if the
Sistine Madonna, will grow inef
fective, forgetting that these have
the vitality which appertains to the
lasting nature of things. No poet
can ever outrival Shakspere"—can
ever take the place of that "crum
bling idol " —" except by a more ex
ceeding insight and utterance. It is
well said that great art is always
modern." And again, with what
pleasure do we acknowledge the
admirable common sense of some
remarks of another critical master
(who in such matters rarely fails to
hit the mark), concerning the so
called "Irish literary movement,"
which once again is only another
illustration of the outworkings of
the spirit of Provincialism. "J
confess," says Professor Dowden,
"that I am not ambitious of inten
sifying my intellectual or spiritual
brogue. . . . No folly can be
greater than that of fancying
that we shall strengthen our lit
erary position by living exclu
sively in our own ideas" —
that is, by "emancipating" our
selves —"and showing ourselves in
hospitable to the best ideas of other
lands" —and, we may add, of that
great past, which, the "emanci
pated" tell us, is no longer "vital."
And Professor Dowden adds one
most significant remark. "Every
great literary movement of modern
Kurope," be reminds us, "has been
born from the wedlock of two peo
ples." Should not this fact suggest
to us —to those of us, at all events,
who are not so thoroughly emanci
pated as to care nothing for the
teachings of history—that complete
emancipation might after all mean
— complete sterility ?
Hut if we need emancipation, it
is surely emancipation from such
clogging and paralyzing provincial
ism ; and this emancipation we
should help to accomplish in the
university classroom, and by uni
versity culture. Knowledge of the
best in literature that the world
has produced—the fineness of in
sight and the certainty of taste
which are developed by personal
contact with the vital and enduring
elements in the great books of past
and present: these things are what
we need always and everywhere—
and need more than ever today
and here in California—if we would
save ourselves from the perversion
of effort and the waste of power. A
man who has learned to appreciate

and feel what its vital and enduring
in the literature of Greece, England,
Italy, France, Germany —who has
been brought, let us say, under the
discipline of Sophocles, Shakspere,
Dante, Voltaire, Goethe —will have
been swept so far into the great
main current of culture, that he
will be in little danger of being
caught up in momentary eddies, or
washed into obscure backwater of
the stream. In such a school, we
learn to see things in their right
relations, estimate them by true
and permanent standards of value,
and put them into their proper
places.
And how sadly the power to do
this is needed just at present is
made manifest when we observe
the terrible lack of any sense of
proportion and perspective ex
hibited in newspaper reviews,
in magazine articles, in com
mon judgments about books and
authors hastily struck out in
conversation or more deliberately
registered in print. Look for a
moment at our whole modern
business of book-reviewing—note
its conspicuous short-comings—and
ask honestly what for the most part
it is really worth. I do not wish
to seem hard or querulous in my
censure; but in its more popular
forms, at any rate, is it for the most
part really worth anything at all ?
A reviewer, in virtue of his official
position, is supposed (and if this
be but a supposition, then so much
the worse for thefact) —is supposed
to guide and check public opinion
about things of which he is sup
posed (and again if this be but a
supposition, then so much the worse
for the fact), to know more than
the general reader ; it is, by the
hypothesis, his special function to
offer opinions which will help, di
rect, enlighten. Hut in the larger
proportion of cases, is this function
fultilled ? Does the magazine ar
ticle, does the newspaper criticism,
really guide or check, help, direct,
enlighten ? To put the question
in this downright fashion is surely
to answer it. And the worst aspect
of the matter is not, after all, that
article and criticism are so often
evidently the work of men who do
not in the least understand what
they are talking about. That is
bad enough, of course ; but the as
sertions of mere ignorance are, 1
take it, less subtly and less con
stantly dangerous than the distor
tion of critical vision commonly
exhibited even by men who take
their work seriously, write with
more than ordinary care, and show
a laudable desire to say something
to the point. A new novel is pub
lished —a book perhaps with many
admirable qualities and well de
serving a word of cordial recogni
tion. We turn to a notice of it in
a paper or magazine, and we find
the reviewer almost beside himself
in a frenzy of wonder and excite
ment. The work is hailed as a mas
terpiece, the author pronounced on
the spot a writer beside whom—if
we are to take his language at its
liberal meaning—Scott, Balzac,
Thackeray, are as prattling chil
dren. A year or two goes by ; the
great book and the great author
disappear from sight, or drop back
into the rank of the ephemerals;
and the critic, who seems never to
learn by experience, cheerfully and
unblushingiy breaks forth into an
other paeon over the arrival of an
other masterpiece, from the pen of
another genius ot the first, order.
What, we say in our confusion, is
it possible that there are really so
many Scotts, and Balzacs, and
Thackerays about ? Does the spread
of democracy mean that hereafter

geniuses are to l>e plenty as black
berries ? Or why all this fuss ?
And then we recall Browning's
legate who had lived to see —and
see out —four and twenty leaders of
revolt. But though there are moods
in which we may find passing
amusement in the situation, it is
but passing amusement, after all.
For if we are truly in earnest about
literature, all this laxity of critical
opinion must necessarily alarm us,
since we cannot blind ourselves
to the danger—the great and se
rious danger — inherent in our
wholesale abandonment of high
standards and the consequent vitia
tion of public tas-te. And where,
we ask, is any corrective to be
sought ? It must be sought in such
knowledge and insight as are given,
in such discipline and breadth of
view as are afforded, by the culture
of the university classroom. It is
not, indeed, to be argued that any
amount of university training will
of itself make a reviewer conscien
tious in the performance of his diffi
cult and sometimes delicate duty—
especially in these days when even
reputable publishers seek to bias
his mind and "inspire" his utter
ances. But such training will most
certainly give some sense of meas
ure, some feeling fur proportion,
some realization of what has and
what has not substantial claims
upon attention ; and in virtue of
these gains, a man's work as critic,
as leader of opinion, will neces
sarily become more temperate, more
intelligent, more helpful.
And to the culture and training
of the university classroom again,
we have mainly to look for a much
needed check upon yet another ten
dency of our time more widespread
and more generally pernicious than
any yet referred to. The evil of
which we now come to speak is not
local, or of sudden growth ; it per
vades almost the entire reading
world ; and it has developed grad
ually out of the changing social
conditions of the past fifty or sixty
years. I have in mind,as you will
have anticipated, the enormous re
cent growth of periodical litera
ture, and the intellectual results
which are now beginning to be rec
ognized as arising from our ever
increasing dependence upon it.
Ours is, we are often told, em
phatically a, reading age. 1 do not
deny this; indeed, if we consider
only the number of lines of print
per capita actually consumed by
our population, day by day, year
by year, no other age in history
has had such a claim to the dis
tincti >n. But it is, 1 am afraid, at
the same time an age of rapid read
ing, superficial reading, thoughtless
reading —of the kind of reading
which dissipates the energies, un
dermines the power of attention,
and plays havoc with the mind.
Coleridge long ago classed the con
stant perusal of periodicals among
anti-mnemonics, or destroyers of
memory, and looked with dread at
the growth of the magazine and
newspaper habit. If he was
alarmed, what should our feelings
be ? Step into a bookstore in the
early part of the month, and
turn over the magazines, just out,
and freshly exposed for sale, in all
the meretricious attractiveness of
elaborate covers, designed to arrest
the wandering eye. There they are
— ranged in picturesque rows —
pretentious, unpretentious—cheap,
dear —good, bad, indifferent; some
professing literary excellence—some
frankly abandoning all title to any
thing of the kind. Now, of course,
these publications vary in worth as
widely as they differ in their styles ;
and it would be unjust to lump

tliem together, and dismiss them all
with a single \rord of condemnation.
But what is the general impression
they leave upon us when we view
them in the lot ? It is not a pleas
ant impression,certainly. What a
mass of rubbish goes to the mak
ing of these monthly concoctions !
How poor —how unspeakably poor
—is, on the average, the stuff which
they set before their buyers ? How
little in any one of them are we
likely to find what will stand the
test of a second thoughtful reading !
Many of them are scarcely more
than picture-books—collections of
photogravures and the like, accom
panied by some weak explanatory
letter-press ; in most of them, again,
as is natural in an age which has
an unworthy passion for personal
ities, large space is given to portraits
of distinguished or notorious peo
ple, and to the catchpenny gossip
about them which, true or false, is
always held safe to amuse an idle
half-hour. Even, 1 grieve to say,
in our so-called literary magazines
—in periodicals directly devoted to
literature and its interests — the
same childish tendencies are to be
found encroaching on every side.
Here, too, we have not only ac
counts of new publications, and the
information we properly desire to
gain about current affairs in the
book world ; we have also pictures
of all the new rivals of Scott, Balzac,
and Thackeray—of their fathers,
mothers, uncles, and aunts —of
their places of birth and residence
— facsimiles from their manu
scripts, scraps from their letters,
and details innumerable about their
private lives and methods of work
—whether, for instance, they are
married or single, write the more
fluently before breakfast or at mid
night, prefer coffee or tea, golfing or
boating —with other such matter
of manifest importance in the
study of their books. All this is
positively painful. And if a little
serious consideration of our maga
zines fills ns with misapprehen
sion, what shall we say about
our newspapers ? —about our Sun
day newspapers particularly, which
themselves aspire to take rank as
magazines? What shall we say?
Perhaps it will be safest not to at
tempt to say anything. It would
be hard to do justice to such a
subject.
The bearings of our growing habit
of miscellaneous reading upon our
mental life and through this upon
real literature, have been admirably
described by a couple of writers,
whose words will carry so much
more weight than my own, that I
will ask you to listen to them in my
behalf.
Says Charles Dudley Warner : —
"The habit of excessive newspaper
reading, in which a great variety of
topics is inadequately treated, has
a curious effect on the mind. It
becomes demoralized, gradually
loses the power of concentration
or of continuous thought, and even
loses the inclination to read the
long articles which the newspaper
prints. The eye catches a thousand
things, but is detained by no
one. . . . The effect of this
scrappy desultory reading is bad
enough when the hashed compound
selected is tolerably good. It be
comes a very serious matter when
the reading itself is vapid, frivolous,
or bad. The responsibility of se
lecting the mental food for millions
of people is serious. When, in the
last century, in England, the So
ciety for the Diffusion of Useful In
formation, which accomplished so
much good, was organized, this re
sponsibility was felt, and competent
hands prepared the popular books
and pamphlets. . . . Now, it
happens that a hundred thousand
people, perhaps a million in some
cases, surrender the right of the all
important selection of food for their
minds to some unknown and irre
sponsible person whose business it
is to choose the miscellaneous read
ing-matter for a particular news-

paper. His or her taste may he
good, or it may he immature and
vicious ; it may he used simply to
create a sensation ; and yet the
million of readers get nothing ex
cept what this one person chooses
they shall read . . . Day after
day, Sunday after Sunday, they
read only what this unknown per
son selects for them. Instead of
going to the library and cultivating
their own tastes, and pursuing some
subject that will increase their
mental vigor and add to their per
manent stock of thought, they frit
ter away their time upon a hash of
literature chopped up for them by
a person possibly very unfit even
to make a good hash. The mere
statement of this surrender of one's
judgment of what shall be his in
tellectual life, is alarming."
1 have now indicated a few of
the directions in which the aca
demic study of literature should lie
made to count in the interests of
literature itself. It might perhaps
be expected that I should now say
something about the hearings of my
arguments upon our own classroom
work. Hut as any detailed discus
sion of methods would he here out
of place, I shall content myself, in
conclusion, with touching briefly
upon a couple of inferences the im
portance of which will, I trust, be
field to justify the emphasis I de
sire to throw upon them.
The broad view which I have
throughout taken of our university
responsibilities rests, of course, upon
an equally broad conception of the
literary training which it is one of
our chief objects to afford ; and
this in turn implies a distinction
between general literary culture on
the one hand, and what we techni
cally call scholarship on the other.
Here, then, in the University we
who deal witn literature have a
two-fold duty resting upon us — to
train the few as specialists, and to
help the many in the higher cul
ture of their lives ; and I maintain
that in our curriculum we should
keep these separate ends separately
in view. The future specialist
must rightly be asked to spend

j many laborious hours among minor
writers and relatively uninteresting
periods, in lines of minute investi
gation, in questions of detailed
| classification and analysis. But
meanwhile the general student
comes to us with but little energy
i available for a subject which for him
belongs now and will always be
long to the margin of his activities.
Well, under the circumstances

we cannot hope to make a scholar
of him ; we can at best give him
only a smattering of knowledge, an
imperfect conception of critical me
thods and results ; and while we
are doing this by putting him
through some part of the routine
adapted to the specialist, we are
wasting time which might be more
profitably spent in other ways,and,
it is more than probable, are culti
vating a false idea of literature and
a habit of mind which will present
ly be not helpful but injurious.
Professor Minto was right in as
serting that the study of English
literature could be made for all
students as severe a discipline as
the study of the classics; but he was
also right in adding that in the vast
majority of cases people are not
apt to find much subsequent satis
faction in the things which have
been used mainly as a training for
their minds. And in the vast ma
jority of cases, not mental discipline
purchased at the price of disen
chantment, but the development of
a large and living interest in litera
ture, is the mark at which we
should aim. How is it, I have
often been forced to ask myself,
that we often find such a fresh
spontaneous delight in literature
among men and women who have
never been through our university
courses ; while among so many who
havehad the advantage of our criti
cal drill and direction increased
knowledge has brought with it
apathy and indifference ? Mow is
it that while the student may know
so much more about a play of
Shakspere's, it is the outsider who
still, in a broad human way, feels
its passion and its power the more
intensely and thus gets really so
! much more out of it? We must
j admit that there is something rad
ically wrong somewhere when the
i academic study of literature is so
frequently equivalent to intellect
ual vaccination : one has a slight
attack, superinduced by artificial
means, and is thereby safeguarded
from any serious trouble of the
same kind in times to come. The
evil, I am bold to say, is largely

due to the wholesale sacrifice of
general culture to special scholar
ship ; and this, again, is in great
measure the outcome of the en
croachment upon literature of the
scientific spirit. We hear over
much novv-a-days of the need of
studying literature scientifically.
Now this notion of studying litera
ture scientifically means either
something which is neither very
new nor very remarkable, or some
thing against which it is our duty
to enter a vigorous protest. If it
means that in dealing with litera
ture and the history of literature,
we must he careful to know our
facts, see them steadily, set them in
their proper relationships, then no
one would complain : all this, I say,
is neither very new nor very re
markable. But if, on the other
hand, it means that the analytical
spirit and method of science — the
laboratory spirit and method — are
to he applied to the subject-matter
of literature, — if it means this, and
the consequent abandonment of the
true spirit and method of literature
itself —then surely the time has
come for those of us who believe in
literature as much as we believe in
science, to place ourselves at the
doors of our lecture-rooms, and
courageously bar the way. Litera
ture is not science, any more than
science is literature ; and the true
lines of approach to one and the
other subject differ as widely as the
aims and purposes of the subjects
themselves. Why, then, the scienti
fic study of literature, any more
than the literary study of science ?
As we demand the scientific study
of science, so we demand the liter
ary study of literature ; and the
literary study of literature means
something more than scholarship
— something more than the most
minute and accurate knowledge of
books, writers, dates, influences, the
evolution of forms and schools ; it
means the reaching of the brain

and soul of ail author and his work.
We may freely admit the practical
difficulty to which we are intro
duced when we conceive the matter
thus ;'for you may get twenty teach
ers of scientific method and scho
larship for one who himself feels
the inner spirit of literature and
has the power of bringing others to
feel it with him. But, all practi
cal difficulty notwithstanding, the
true ideals of literary culture
must still he setup in our lecture
rooms if our work there is to he
filled with the real life of thespirit,
and if we are to do our part in help
ing forward the higher civilization
of the great outer world.

Of all forms of mistake, (Jeorge
Eliot somewhere remarks, prophecy
is the most gratuitous. With such
a word of warning well in mind, I
would not wish to make this an oc
casion for indulging myself in any
rash predictions concerning what,
in the way of literature, the future
may or may not have in store. But
for those of us whose business it is
to pay some attention to the social
and intellectual conditions which,
at different times in the world's
history, have favored the free and
effective play of artistic genius, it
is only natural, 1 suppose, to turn
analysis occasionally from the
things of the past upon the circum
stances of our own time and place.
And if, as a result of such analysis,we
are led to speculate a litte curiously
on the possibility of fresh artistic
developments in years to come, we
may perhaps be allowed to do so
without protest, on the understand
ing that we are concerned only with
possibilities, and that we fully rec
ognize how frequently in such mat
ters the most carefully formed
hypotheses may he brought to
naught by the sudden irruption of
factors which have eluded scrutiny
or defied formulation.
Unless the signs of the times are
altogether misleading, therefore, I i
cannot but feel we have legiti
mate cause to believe that in the
not far distant future we may wit
ness, here on the Pacific Coast, the
beginnings of a literary movement
as distinct in character, as racy,
and in its kind as interesting and
valuable as that which, by the
middle of our century, had won
abiding glory for New England.
For here—as the most superficial
observation of the facts and condi-1
tions of California life should suf
fice to show us —the creative artist
of tomorrow — be he poet, novelist,
or dramatist- will find himself in
a new world of rare and splendid
opportunity. Think for a moment
of the stirring story of our still im
mediate past: —a story teeming with
records of adventure, of turbulence,
and violence, and conflict, of prim
itive passions, of bizarre achieve
ments and failures, of dramatic
crises, and the gradual building of
social order out of lawlessness and
confusion. There surely is a mass i
of moving incident and picturesque'
character as genuinely romantic
and as profoundly human as that
upon which the genius of Scott was
privileged to draw in the history
and legends of the Border. Nor
will the social field of today prove
a whit less fertile in theme and in
spiration. We have only to note
the striking vigor and diversity of
our western life—the cosmopolitan
ism which has resulted both from
the clash and from the blending of
races —the startling contrasts in
social types and ideals —the fresh
ness of the manhood and woman
hood fostered by our abounding
personal freedom and lack of con
ventional restraints ; -we have only
to note these things to realize that
we have here, indeed, ready to
hand, the raw material for nniny a
rich unwritten chapter in the peren

nial comedie kumaine. Moreover,
in reckoning up conditions, we must
not forget the stimulating qualities
of our mental atmosphere itself.
No one, born and bred in other en
vironments, can live for a few years
in California without remarking
upon the intellectual traits which
characterize the younger genera
tions here —upon their eagerness,
curiosity, expansiveness, generous
sympathies, quick perception, and
instructive response to art. An
artist depends largely upon his
public; and to live in so bracing
an intellectual climate must count
for not a little in his work. And
finally, in the fact that we are here
comparatively free from some of
the cramping influences of puritan-

ism, we may venture to emphasize
another element, which should con
duce somewhat — perhaps materi
ally —to the large and liberal ex
pression of artistic power.
Let it We understood that, in
speaking in this way, I am not ac
cepting, even in its most general
application, Taine's famous and
much-abused formula of the race,
the milieu, and the moment. No
such formula—no formula of any
kind—will explain genius, or ac
count satisfactorily for its manifes
tations ; nor will the closest study
of intellectual conditions and social
forces enable us to indicate before
hand what form any new literature
will take, or whether, indeed, there
will be any new literature worth
talking about. After all, when the
so-called scientific—which is more
often than not a merely pseudo
scientific— method of investigating
literary phenomena, has done its

utmost, it still remains true that,
no matter how favorable the condi
tions, how rich the soil, how keen
the intellectual atmosphere, where
no great poet happens to be born,
we shall have no great poetry;
where no great novelist or dramatist
appears, we shall have no great fic
tion or drama. The wind bloweth
where it listeth.and we must await
the rise of the Creator, the true
maker, and be content to recognize
in his coming what for us must re
main—l do not baulk the word—a
miracle, all our philosophic formu
las notwithstanding. All 1 insist
upon is, that given the literary
genius, the man of insight and cre
ative power, then existing condi
tions here should in many ways be

distinctly favorable to his growth
and free expression. Heine once
remarked that ;i man should he
very careful in the choice of his
parents. In likewise, a poet or
novelist should he very careful
about the place and time of his ap
pearance upon this planet. And a
poet or novelist might certainly do
worse than to get himself born .-it
the moment in California, where,as
I have argued, he will find ample
stimulus and opportunity to work
out whatever power may he in him.
It is natural, therefore, that we,
whose privilege it is to help to
mould in some degree the destinies
of the rising generations, should
look with interest at these various
indications of possible future lit
erary activity, and that such in
terest should be particularly keen
in the case of those of us whose own
work lies on the literary side of the
higher education. And with us, at

all events, this interest is bound to
partake of a practical character.
Noting the signs as we must, and
speculating as we may upon their
value and significance, we are also
led to ask ourselves what we may
personally do—what the University
as an organ and center of culture
may do—to aid and direct the
fores out of which the literary
movements of the future will take
their rise.
In venturing to offer some sug
gestions by way of answer to this
question, 1 may conveniently begin
by laying stress 011 the fact that the
literary influence of the University
and its curriculum will necessarily
be almost wholly critical and dis
ciplinary in its character, By this
I mean that we, within academic
walls, must not nourish the illusory
hope of helping to any extent to
develop the creative spirit, or to
furnish productive strength and
quickening power. Indeed, I will
go so far as to assert that the atti
tude toward literature which is so
sedulously cultivated in our class
rooms, and which it is the main
part of our purpose to cultivate, is,
and always must he, the reverse of
favorable to creative effort. Ob
serve, that I do not now refer to the
unfortunate results which follow
when literature is badly taught—
results which are indeed common
enough, because literature is often
badly taught, but which are none
the less due to abuses in method
and system, and, as such, are not
inevitable. That many young men
and women go out from our col
leges. as many boys and girls go
out from our schools, not only with
out the slightest real apprehension
of the spirit and meaning of the
great masterpieces to which they
have been introduced, but even with
a positive aversion to such master
pieces. is of course a fact to be
deeply deplored. Hut such must
continue to be the main upshot of
our classroom training wherever
the reading of a great piece of lit
erature is made primarily a drill in
linguistics, a course is textual crit
icism, an occasion for the pouring
in of all sorts of general knowledge
—so long, in a word, as the true
ends of literary culture are delib
erately or ignorantly sacrificed to
the ends of so-called—and often
miscalled — scholarship. But all
such evil consequences of the grind
ing of the academic mills—Which,
like the mills of God, grind slowly,
but exceeding small — belong, as J
have said, to the region of abuses
only, and, therefore, need not now
detain us. The point that I now
wish to make goes deeper, and takes
us down to the first principles of
all our academic study of letters.
For, as a matter not of choice, but
of necessity, practically our whole
effort in the classroom is expended
in the training and strengthening
of the critical faculties —our point
of view throughout is the purely
critical pointof view. This cannot,
so far as 1 see, be otherwise. Yet
what is the result ? Literature
conies unavoidably to be regarded
by teachers whose lives are given
up entirely to this point of view,
and therefore by the students who
are brought under their influence,
as a caput mortuum for analysis

and dissection. We go to work
with carefully elaborated methods,
and in the spirit of the disinter
ested scientific inquirer ; we probe,
arrange, classify, generalize, for
mulate ; we discuss environment,
cause and affect, action and reac
tion, influences, schools. Far be it
from me to say that all these things
have not their place and value ;
though it is hard enough sometimes,
in the conduct of our investigations,
to make sure that the finer spirit,
the essential life, the delicate aroma
of literature, do not escape us in
the process. But l.do insist that
all this minute and painstaking
analytic study can at best be of
little service when it comes to the
actual making of literature, and
may sometimes be therein a positive
obstacle. We are only dealing with
commonplaces when we assert that
in the history of literature the crit
ical spirit has been hostile to cre
ative power; and, though no one
would deny that there are many
individual instances in which crit
ical spirit and creative power have
been combined, still, in the average
of cases, the cultivation of the one
must be at the expense of theother.
And as, in our classroom work, our
temper is critical, our standpoint
critical, I conceive that 1 have fully
justified my perhaps rather startling
proposition that the issue of our
labors is, and must necessarily be,
the reverse of favorable to creative
effort.
But all this is, after all, only the
negative view of our academic du
ties, privileges, and responsibilities.
To reach the positive view we have
only to consider the complementary
aspect of our general statement.
For if we say that our work must
be in the main critical and disci
plinary in character, what do we
imply by such a declaration? We
imply, to begin with, that we may
do much to guide and regulate cre
ative genius ; to prevent it from
stultifying itself by errors of judg
ment and mistaken ideals ; to save
it from wasting effort in fruitless
experiments. It has been well said
that an ordinary music-master may
be of much service even to an em
bryo Mozart by pointing out to him
certain things that he must not do,
and so holding him on the high
road to true achievement. And we
imply, moreover, that while we
may do this for the creative artist
himself, we may also aid him and
his work greatly in indirect ways
by our uplifting and enlightening
influence upon the reading public
to which he will make his appeal.
In estimating the duty which the
university owes to society in the
matter of literary culture, I should
say then that it is a large part of
our business to train up, and pass
out into the world, year by year, a
body of good, intelligent, apprecia
tive, and judicious readers, capable
of discriminating between the real
and the meretricious in literature,
and thus of rating the books which
are put before them at something
like their real worth.
Here, then, we reach a point de
serving the strongest emphasis. The
knowledge of literature and of the
history of literature, the clear in
sight and the critical judgment,
which it is our aim, in the Univer
sity classroom, to give and foster,
should yield that culture which in
itself is full of saving grace. In
other words, our ambition must be
to cultivate within our students,
through sympathetic contact with
the greatest and best things in the
literature of the world, a permanent
and high standard of artistic values
—a standard to which all literature
whatsoever may be brought for test.

Because in literature there are no
tinal objective criteria to refer to, it
is sometimes idly supposed that we
can have no stable or trustworthy
criteria at all : —it is all subjective,
we are told ; artistic excellence is
this to me and that to t.hee, and
there the matter must rest. Hut
in fact there is no more reason for
deciding questions of art upon the
opinion of the man in the street,
than there is for allowing him the
last word on questions of astronomy
or biology. Anolate France, vig
orously insisting that all literary
judgments must be merely personal,
once roundly declared that a critic,
to be honest, should say—not,
Gentlemen, I am to speak to you
about Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere ; but, Gentlemen, I am to
speak to you about myself in rela
tion to Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere. Within certain limits, 1
conceive this to be perfectly true.
But is there no distinction to be
made between the verdict of the
literary scholar, when he speaks of
himself in relation to Racine, Pas
cal, Shakspere, and that, let us say,
of the half-educated journalist man
ufacturing an article to order upon
himself in relation to the thinker or
the playwright ? Formal answer
to such a question is surely un
necessary. Though we may admit
the impossibility of establishing
exact objective touchstones, which
will be in the hands of the specialist,
but of which the ordinary individ
ual will know little or nothing—
though we must thus reject any
attempt to put our judgments on
the firm foundations of a science,
we are not, therefore, to regard crit
icism as reduced to anarchy —to a
chaos of feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. We insist upon the
fundamental differences in value
among feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. Jf the scientist re
fuses to take the conclusions of the
first man he meets concerning the
evidence for or against the trans
mission of acquired characters, we
just as emphatically refuse to take
the conclusions of the first man we
meet about the relative importance
of the novels of Jane Austen and
Archibald C. Gunter, or the worth
and significance of the writings of
Charles Lamb or Walter Pater.
No more in literature than in science
are we prepared to accept manhood
suffrage, and settle things by plebis
cite. Only those who know liter
ature in a large and generous way,
who have been in personal com
munion with the great writers of the
past and present, who have consid
ered, analyzed, compared, whose
perception has thus been trained,
whose judgment has thus been
matured —only such are really en
titled to a hearing in matters where
issues of artistic valuation are in
volved. Well, it is part of our duty
in the university to leaven the
reading mass of the public—the vo
racious, untrained, uncritical public
—with the leaven of the higher
culture, and so to send out into
society —not only through teachers
and journalists, but also in the
various walks of private life —lines
of influence which shall help to
raise the general taste, and thus
count positively for good.
Noting all this in a broad way,
we will now try to indicate one or
two special directions in which, as
regards both writers and their read
ers, such culture should be made to
tell.
One considerable danger by which
we who live in California are con
tinually threatened is the danger
which arises from our isolation. In
what ways this isolation affects for
ill the general life of the State, this

is not the place to inquire. Our
concern is simply with its bearings
upon literature ; and in literature,
its evil tendencies are sufficiently
marked. These may be summed
up in the one word —Provincial-
ism,—provincialism, with its ac
companying narrowness of aim and
purpose, of understanding and sym
pathy. Insularity, the French crit
ics are fond of insisting, is always
the prison of art ; and provin
cialism, it would be well for
us to remember, is only another
name for insularity. One would
have supposed that, at this time
of day, people would begin to
realize that the intellectual wel
fare and progress of any com
munity are best guaranteed and
subserved by broad, direct, and
constant contact with the thought
and feeling of the great outer world.
Yet so far is this from being our
case, that here provincialism is de
liberately fostered by the newspa
pers, and by a number of well
meaning but short-sighted theorists
who seem to regard aloofness, self
involution, and intellectual clan
nishness as the one certain means
of insuring individual independ
ence and free personal growth. In
this way we are asked to resuscitate
the exploded ideals of the days of
the Barlows and the Dwights, when,
as a protest against hated British
tyranny, the American writer
sought to break loose altogether
from British literary tradition in
style, method, even orthography ;
we are asked to repeat the demand
of Mr. Hathaway, in " Kaavnagh,"
for a "national literature" which
shall be "altogether shaggy and
unshorn " ; we are asked to adopt
the worst errors of Walt Whitman,
who, in order to show his dem
ocratic vigor and Americanism,
made wild critical assaults upon
Shakspere and Tennyson, and, with
a loud " go to !" set himself to man
ufacture, out of hand, a new litera
ture, fresh in principle,and without
indebtedness to the past. It is ade
quate literary culture that must save
us from such follies in the future,
as it was adequate literary culture —
in the person of Oliver Wendell
Holmes and a few other influential
men of the time —that saved Ainer
tcan literature from them half a
century ago. " I remember," says
Holmes' biographer, Mr. John T.
Morse, " I remember once hearing
a gentleman of some reputation in
literature say —actually in address
ing the Board of Overseers of a dis
tinguished seat of learning—that
he did not approve of teaching
young men to write 'good English,'
to use words accurately, and to
construct sentences gramatically ;
on the contrary, he said that he
wanted an infusion of the wild,
rough inaccuracies of the great new
West! He was," Mr. Morse con
tinues, " the victim of a foolish
notion, that one of the available
ways to show 'American independ
ence of England,' was by devising
a degraded dialect of the English
language for use in the United
States Nor was he alone in this
feeling . . . ; there was for a
while a wild pseudo-literary fad in
this direction. Dr. Holmes looked
upon it with disgust and indigna
tion, making his opinions known
with his usual outspoken courage,
and exemplifying them by his own
action, with the result that he was
for a while subjected to some abuse."
If today we all recognize the bene
ficial influence of Holmes' con
servatism, we should equally recog
nize the important part which such
conservatism —the conservatism of
culture —has still to play, particu
larly in our own western world.

I would not have it supposed that
I overlook the meaning and value
of provincialism, or fail to appre
ciate what is vital and significant,
for example, beneath the strain,
the conscious posturings, the affecta
tions and perversities of Whitman's
work. Literary history shows
clearly enough that, during periods
which tend to formalism and con
vention, provincialism has often
done splendid work by bringing
new material and new blood into
art. The provincial movement is,
for exam[de, to be reckoned one of
the potent generative forces in the
romantic developments of the latter
half of the eighteenth century. Hut
literary history also shows with
equal clearness how futile and un
profitable provincialism always be
comes when it rests mainly on its
sense of newness and isolation —
when it refuses to relate itseif in
direct and healthy contact with
the best things in the world outside
and the transmitted culture of by
gone ages. Many a man of real
genius and promise has fallen short
of effective utterance by wandering
off after some spectral ambition of
originality ; many a fresh move
ment has come to naught because
it has cut itself loose from culture,
and has sought its purpose and its
field in narrow aims and parochial
interests. One of our younger gen
eration of writers has constituted
himself the spokesman and evan
gelist of what lie calls the libera
tion of the "great West." Accord
ing to him, the first important
thing for the "great West" to do
in literature is—to get itself "eman
cipated." Incidentally we might
suggest that the first important
thing for the "great West," or for
any other part of the world, to do
in literature, is to write great books ;
and that it is extremely doubtful
whether any really valuable output
of literature was ever yet heralded
or helped by clamorous and hys
terical demands for emancipation.
Hut these are points which we may
at present leave undiscussed. Con
cerning what Mr. Hamlin Garland
means by emancipation, however,
we need not remain in doubt. The
day of the East —the day of foreign
influence, according to him —is over,
or should be over. In this fact
lies our hope of "emancipation."
The past —the phrase is bis own
"is not vital " ; we must abandon
-the phrase is again his own—its
"crumbling idols"; we must break
once and for all with its traditions,
methods, usages. Now all this is
simply provincialism run mad —
fanatical provincialism, asserting
its own unreason and rejoicing in
it. Let the " great West " manifest
its spirit in literature, by all means;
let it find its own way ; let it
deal freshly with its magnificent
fresh material ; let it build its own
edifice, if necessary, in its own
chosen style of architecture. If it
succeeds, it will succeed because its
work is good, sound, valid —not be
cause it is wrought in an anti-feudal
spirit, or with any dogmatic inten
tion of "emancipating" itself from
anything or anybody. Hut we may
be sure of this —that such work will
not lie done the better or the more
effectively —that it will never be
helped, and may be seriously
marred, and even invalidated—by
being conceived in a boastful tem
per, and planned and carried
through in reckless ignorance of
what has succeeded and what
has failed in the past. When
Mr. Garland himself gives us his
stories of prairie life, we are in
terested, we are moved and stirred,
not because they are examples of
"emancipated" literature, but be
cause, after all, they have in them
some measure of the true life which
has secured pemanence and univer
sality —for all literature worth the
name, from the Book of Job
and the Homeric Epos down
to "The Man Who Was"and
" Madame Delphine." The first
and last aim of the artist
should be to endue his own work
with something of this true life. If
he fail to do so, of what service to
him or to us will be his Declaration
of Independence? If he succeed,
he need not trouble himself about
"emancipation," and rest assured
that we, his readers, will not trouble
ourselves about it in our turn.
What a relief it is, then, to turn
from the crude dogmatism of Mr.
Garland to the wise words of one
who knows literature as a scholar
and feels it as a poet. " Shakspere's
creations," writes Mr. Stedman,
"have been pronounced outworn"
—Shakspere being, of course, one of
the "crumbling idols" handed down
to us from a past which is not
"vital"—"have been pronounced
outworn, because he was the last
great 'poet of feudalism.' We
might as well say that the truth to
human life displayed in Genesis or
Exodus, or the synthetic beauty of
the Parthenon, or the glory (if the
Sistine Madonna, will grow inef
fective, forgetting that these have
the vitality which appertains to the
lasting nature of things. No poet
can ever outrival Shakspere"—can
ever take the place of that "crum
bling idol " —" except by a more ex
ceeding insight and utterance. It is
well said that great art is always
modern." And again, with what
pleasure do we acknowledge the
admirable common sense of some
remarks of another critical master
(who in such matters rarely fails to
hit the mark), concerning the so
called "Irish literary movement,"
which once again is only another
illustration of the outworkings of
the spirit of Provincialism. "J
confess," says Professor Dowden,
"that I am not ambitious of inten
sifying my intellectual or spiritual
brogue. . . . No folly can be
greater than that of fancying
that we shall strengthen our lit
erary position by living exclu
sively in our own ideas" —
that is, by "emancipating" our
selves —"and showing ourselves in
hospitable to the best ideas of other
lands" —and, we may add, of that
great past, which, the "emanci
pated" tell us, is no longer "vital."
And Professor Dowden adds one
most significant remark. "Every
great literary movement of modern
Kurope," be reminds us, "has been
born from the wedlock of two peo
ples." Should not this fact suggest
to us —to those of us, at all events,
who are not so thoroughly emanci
pated as to care nothing for the
teachings of history—that complete
emancipation might after all mean
— complete sterility ?
Hut if we need emancipation, it
is surely emancipation from such
clogging and paralyzing provincial
ism ; and this emancipation we
should help to accomplish in the
university classroom, and by uni
versity culture. Knowledge of the
best in literature that the world
has produced—the fineness of in
sight and the certainty of taste
which are developed by personal
contact with the vital and enduring
elements in the great books of past
and present: these things are what
we need always and everywhere—
and need more than ever today
and here in California—if we would
save ourselves from the perversion
of effort and the waste of power. A
man who has learned to appreciate

and feel what its vital and enduring
in the literature of Greece, England,
Italy, France, Germany —who has
been brought, let us say, under the
discipline of Sophocles, Shakspere,
Dante, Voltaire, Goethe —will have
been swept so far into the great
main current of culture, that he
will be in little danger of being
caught up in momentary eddies, or
washed into obscure backwater of
the stream. In such a school, we
learn to see things in their right
relations, estimate them by true
and permanent standards of value,
and put them into their proper
places.
And how sadly the power to do
this is needed just at present is
made manifest when we observe
the terrible lack of any sense of
proportion and perspective ex
hibited in newspaper reviews,
in magazine articles, in com
mon judgments about books and
authors hastily struck out in
conversation or more deliberately
registered in print. Look for a
moment at our whole modern
business of book-reviewing—note
its conspicuous short-comings—and
ask honestly what for the most part
it is really worth. I do not wish
to seem hard or querulous in my
censure; but in its more popular
forms, at any rate, is it for the most
part really worth anything at all ?
A reviewer, in virtue of his official
position, is supposed (and if this
be but a supposition, then so much
the worse for thefact) —is supposed
to guide and check public opinion
about things of which he is sup
posed (and again if this be but a
supposition, then so much the worse
for the fact), to know more than
the general reader ; it is, by the
hypothesis, his special function to
offer opinions which will help, di
rect, enlighten. Hut in the larger
proportion of cases, is this function
fultilled ? Does the magazine ar
ticle, does the newspaper criticism,
really guide or check, help, direct,
enlighten ? To put the question
in this downright fashion is surely
to answer it. And the worst aspect
of the matter is not, after all, that
article and criticism are so often
evidently the work of men who do
not in the least understand what
they are talking about. That is
bad enough, of course ; but the as
sertions of mere ignorance are, 1
take it, less subtly and less con
stantly dangerous than the distor
tion of critical vision commonly
exhibited even by men who take
their work seriously, write with
more than ordinary care, and show
a laudable desire to say something
to the point. A new novel is pub
lished —a book perhaps with many
admirable qualities and well de
serving a word of cordial recogni
tion. We turn to a notice of it in
a paper or magazine, and we find
the reviewer almost beside himself
in a frenzy of wonder and excite
ment. The work is hailed as a mas
terpiece, the author pronounced on
the spot a writer beside whom—if
we are to take his language at its
liberal meaning—Scott, Balzac,
Thackeray, are as prattling chil
dren. A year or two goes by ; the
great book and the great author
disappear from sight, or drop back
into the rank of the ephemerals;
and the critic, who seems never to
learn by experience, cheerfully and
unblushingiy breaks forth into an
other paeon over the arrival of an
other masterpiece, from the pen of
another genius ot the first, order.
What, we say in our confusion, is
it possible that there are really so
many Scotts, and Balzacs, and
Thackerays about ? Does the spread
of democracy mean that hereafter

geniuses are to l>e plenty as black
berries ? Or why all this fuss ?
And then we recall Browning's
legate who had lived to see —and
see out —four and twenty leaders of
revolt. But though there are moods
in which we may find passing
amusement in the situation, it is
but passing amusement, after all.
For if we are truly in earnest about
literature, all this laxity of critical
opinion must necessarily alarm us,
since we cannot blind ourselves
to the danger—the great and se
rious danger — inherent in our
wholesale abandonment of high
standards and the consequent vitia
tion of public tas-te. And where,
we ask, is any corrective to be
sought ? It must be sought in such
knowledge and insight as are given,
in such discipline and breadth of
view as are afforded, by the culture
of the university classroom. It is
not, indeed, to be argued that any
amount of university training will
of itself make a reviewer conscien
tious in the performance of his diffi
cult and sometimes delicate duty—
especially in these days when even
reputable publishers seek to bias
his mind and "inspire" his utter
ances. But such training will most
certainly give some sense of meas
ure, some feeling fur proportion,
some realization of what has and
what has not substantial claims
upon attention ; and in virtue of
these gains, a man's work as critic,
as leader of opinion, will neces
sarily become more temperate, more
intelligent, more helpful.
And to the culture and training
of the university classroom again,
we have mainly to look for a much
needed check upon yet another ten
dency of our time more widespread
and more generally pernicious than
any yet referred to. The evil of
which we now come to speak is not
local, or of sudden growth ; it per
vades almost the entire reading
world ; and it has developed grad
ually out of the changing social
conditions of the past fifty or sixty
years. I have in mind,as you will
have anticipated, the enormous re
cent growth of periodical litera
ture, and the intellectual results
which are now beginning to be rec
ognized as arising from our ever
increasing dependence upon it.
Ours is, we are often told, em
phatically a, reading age. 1 do not
deny this; indeed, if we consider
only the number of lines of print
per capita actually consumed by
our population, day by day, year
by year, no other age in history
has had such a claim to the dis
tincti >n. But it is, 1 am afraid, at
the same time an age of rapid read
ing, superficial reading, thoughtless
reading —of the kind of reading
which dissipates the energies, un
dermines the power of attention,
and plays havoc with the mind.
Coleridge long ago classed the con
stant perusal of periodicals among
anti-mnemonics, or destroyers of
memory, and looked with dread at
the growth of the magazine and
newspaper habit. If he was
alarmed, what should our feelings
be ? Step into a bookstore in the
early part of the month, and
turn over the magazines, just out,
and freshly exposed for sale, in all
the meretricious attractiveness of
elaborate covers, designed to arrest
the wandering eye. There they are
— ranged in picturesque rows —
pretentious, unpretentious—cheap,
dear —good, bad, indifferent; some
professing literary excellence—some
frankly abandoning all title to any
thing of the kind. Now, of course,
these publications vary in worth as
widely as they differ in their styles ;
and it would be unjust to lump

tliem together, and dismiss them all
with a single \rord of condemnation.
But what is the general impression
they leave upon us when we view
them in the lot ? It is not a pleas
ant impression,certainly. What a
mass of rubbish goes to the mak
ing of these monthly concoctions !
How poor —how unspeakably poor
—is, on the average, the stuff which
they set before their buyers ? How
little in any one of them are we
likely to find what will stand the
test of a second thoughtful reading !
Many of them are scarcely more
than picture-books—collections of
photogravures and the like, accom
panied by some weak explanatory
letter-press ; in most of them, again,
as is natural in an age which has
an unworthy passion for personal
ities, large space is given to portraits
of distinguished or notorious peo
ple, and to the catchpenny gossip
about them which, true or false, is
always held safe to amuse an idle
half-hour. Even, 1 grieve to say,
in our so-called literary magazines
—in periodicals directly devoted to
literature and its interests — the
same childish tendencies are to be
found encroaching on every side.
Here, too, we have not only ac
counts of new publications, and the
information we properly desire to
gain about current affairs in the
book world ; we have also pictures
of all the new rivals of Scott, Balzac,
and Thackeray—of their fathers,
mothers, uncles, and aunts —of
their places of birth and residence
— facsimiles from their manu
scripts, scraps from their letters,
and details innumerable about their
private lives and methods of work
—whether, for instance, they are
married or single, write the more
fluently before breakfast or at mid
night, prefer coffee or tea, golfing or
boating —with other such matter
of manifest importance in the
study of their books. All this is
positively painful. And if a little
serious consideration of our maga
zines fills ns with misapprehen
sion, what shall we say about
our newspapers ? —about our Sun
day newspapers particularly, which
themselves aspire to take rank as
magazines? What shall we say?
Perhaps it will be safest not to at
tempt to say anything. It would
be hard to do justice to such a
subject.
The bearings of our growing habit
of miscellaneous reading upon our
mental life and through this upon
real literature, have been admirably
described by a couple of writers,
whose words will carry so much
more weight than my own, that I
will ask you to listen to them in my
behalf.
Says Charles Dudley Warner : —
"The habit of excessive newspaper
reading, in which a great variety of
topics is inadequately treated, has
a curious effect on the mind. It
becomes demoralized, gradually
loses the power of concentration
or of continuous thought, and even
loses the inclination to read the
long articles which the newspaper
prints. The eye catches a thousand
things, but is detained by no
one. . . . The effect of this
scrappy desultory reading is bad
enough when the hashed compound
selected is tolerably good. It be
comes a very serious matter when
the reading itself is vapid, frivolous,
or bad. The responsibility of se
lecting the mental food for millions
of people is serious. When, in the
last century, in England, the So
ciety for the Diffusion of Useful In
formation, which accomplished so
much good, was organized, this re
sponsibility was felt, and competent
hands prepared the popular books
and pamphlets. . . . Now, it
happens that a hundred thousand
people, perhaps a million in some
cases, surrender the right of the all
important selection of food for their
minds to some unknown and irre
sponsible person whose business it
is to choose the miscellaneous read
ing-matter for a particular news-

paper. His or her taste may he
good, or it may he immature and
vicious ; it may he used simply to
create a sensation ; and yet the
million of readers get nothing ex
cept what this one person chooses
they shall read . . . Day after
day, Sunday after Sunday, they
read only what this unknown per
son selects for them. Instead of
going to the library and cultivating
their own tastes, and pursuing some
subject that will increase their
mental vigor and add to their per
manent stock of thought, they frit
ter away their time upon a hash of
literature chopped up for them by
a person possibly very unfit even
to make a good hash. The mere
statement of this surrender of one's
judgment of what shall be his in
tellectual life, is alarming."
1 have now indicated a few of
the directions in which the aca
demic study of literature should lie
made to count in the interests of
literature itself. It might perhaps
be expected that I should now say
something about the hearings of my
arguments upon our own classroom
work. Hut as any detailed discus
sion of methods would he here out
of place, I shall content myself, in
conclusion, with touching briefly
upon a couple of inferences the im
portance of which will, I trust, be
field to justify the emphasis I de
sire to throw upon them.
The broad view which I have
throughout taken of our university
responsibilities rests, of course, upon
an equally broad conception of the
literary training which it is one of
our chief objects to afford ; and
this in turn implies a distinction
between general literary culture on
the one hand, and what we techni
cally call scholarship on the other.
Here, then, in the University we
who deal witn literature have a
two-fold duty resting upon us — to
train the few as specialists, and to
help the many in the higher cul
ture of their lives ; and I maintain
that in our curriculum we should
keep these separate ends separately
in view. The future specialist
must rightly be asked to spend

j many laborious hours among minor
writers and relatively uninteresting
periods, in lines of minute investi
gation, in questions of detailed
| classification and analysis. But
meanwhile the general student
comes to us with but little energy
i available for a subject which for him
belongs now and will always be
long to the margin of his activities.
Well, under the circumstances

we cannot hope to make a scholar
of him ; we can at best give him
only a smattering of knowledge, an
imperfect conception of critical me
thods and results ; and while we
are doing this by putting him
through some part of the routine
adapted to the specialist, we are
wasting time which might be more
profitably spent in other ways,and,
it is more than probable, are culti
vating a false idea of literature and
a habit of mind which will present
ly be not helpful but injurious.
Professor Minto was right in as
serting that the study of English
literature could be made for all
students as severe a discipline as
the study of the classics; but he was
also right in adding that in the vast
majority of cases people are not
apt to find much subsequent satis
faction in the things which have
been used mainly as a training for
their minds. And in the vast ma
jority of cases, not mental discipline
purchased at the price of disen
chantment, but the development of
a large and living interest in litera
ture, is the mark at which we
should aim. How is it, I have
often been forced to ask myself,
that we often find such a fresh
spontaneous delight in literature
among men and women who have
never been through our university
courses ; while among so many who
havehad the advantage of our criti
cal drill and direction increased
knowledge has brought with it
apathy and indifference ? Mow is
it that while the student may know
so much more about a play of
Shakspere's, it is the outsider who
still, in a broad human way, feels
its passion and its power the more
intensely and thus gets really so
! much more out of it? We must
j admit that there is something rad
ically wrong somewhere when the
i academic study of literature is so
frequently equivalent to intellect
ual vaccination : one has a slight
attack, superinduced by artificial
means, and is thereby safeguarded
from any serious trouble of the
same kind in times to come. The
evil, I am bold to say, is largely

due to the wholesale sacrifice of
general culture to special scholar
ship ; and this, again, is in great
measure the outcome of the en
croachment upon literature of the
scientific spirit. We hear over
much novv-a-days of the need of
studying literature scientifically.
Now this notion of studying litera
ture scientifically means either
something which is neither very
new nor very remarkable, or some
thing against which it is our duty
to enter a vigorous protest. If it
means that in dealing with litera
ture and the history of literature,
we must he careful to know our
facts, see them steadily, set them in
their proper relationships, then no
one would complain : all this, I say,
is neither very new nor very re
markable. But if, on the other
hand, it means that the analytical
spirit and method of science — the
laboratory spirit and method — are
to he applied to the subject-matter
of literature, — if it means this, and
the consequent abandonment of the
true spirit and method of literature
itself —then surely the time has
come for those of us who believe in
literature as much as we believe in
science, to place ourselves at the
doors of our lecture-rooms, and
courageously bar the way. Litera
ture is not science, any more than
science is literature ; and the true
lines of approach to one and the
other subject differ as widely as the
aims and purposes of the subjects
themselves. Why, then, the scienti
fic study of literature, any more
than the literary study of science ?
As we demand the scientific study
of science, so we demand the liter
ary study of literature ; and the
literary study of literature means
something more than scholarship
— something more than the most
minute and accurate knowledge of
books, writers, dates, influences, the
evolution of forms and schools ; it
means the reaching of the brain

and soul of ail author and his work.
We may freely admit the practical
difficulty to which we are intro
duced when we conceive the matter
thus ;'for you may get twenty teach
ers of scientific method and scho
larship for one who himself feels
the inner spirit of literature and
has the power of bringing others to
feel it with him. But, all practi
cal difficulty notwithstanding, the
true ideals of literary culture
must still he setup in our lecture
rooms if our work there is to he
filled with the real life of thespirit,
and if we are to do our part in help
ing forward the higher civilization
of the great outer world.

Of all forms of mistake, (Jeorge
Eliot somewhere remarks, prophecy
is the most gratuitous. With such
a word of warning well in mind, I
would not wish to make this an oc
casion for indulging myself in any
rash predictions concerning what,
in the way of literature, the future
may or may not have in store. But
for those of us whose business it is
to pay some attention to the social
and intellectual conditions which,
at different times in the world's
history, have favored the free and
effective play of artistic genius, it
is only natural, 1 suppose, to turn
analysis occasionally from the
things of the past upon the circum
stances of our own time and place.
And if, as a result of such analysis,we
are led to speculate a litte curiously
on the possibility of fresh artistic
developments in years to come, we
may perhaps be allowed to do so
without protest, on the understand
ing that we are concerned only with
possibilities, and that we fully rec
ognize how frequently in such mat
ters the most carefully formed
hypotheses may he brought to
naught by the sudden irruption of
factors which have eluded scrutiny
or defied formulation.
Unless the signs of the times are
altogether misleading, therefore, I i
cannot but feel we have legiti
mate cause to believe that in the
not far distant future we may wit
ness, here on the Pacific Coast, the
beginnings of a literary movement
as distinct in character, as racy,
and in its kind as interesting and
valuable as that which, by the
middle of our century, had won
abiding glory for New England.
For here—as the most superficial
observation of the facts and condi-1
tions of California life should suf
fice to show us —the creative artist
of tomorrow — be he poet, novelist,
or dramatist- will find himself in
a new world of rare and splendid
opportunity. Think for a moment
of the stirring story of our still im
mediate past: —a story teeming with
records of adventure, of turbulence,
and violence, and conflict, of prim
itive passions, of bizarre achieve
ments and failures, of dramatic
crises, and the gradual building of
social order out of lawlessness and
confusion. There surely is a mass i
of moving incident and picturesque'
character as genuinely romantic
and as profoundly human as that
upon which the genius of Scott was
privileged to draw in the history
and legends of the Border. Nor
will the social field of today prove
a whit less fertile in theme and in
spiration. We have only to note
the striking vigor and diversity of
our western life—the cosmopolitan
ism which has resulted both from
the clash and from the blending of
races —the startling contrasts in
social types and ideals —the fresh
ness of the manhood and woman
hood fostered by our abounding
personal freedom and lack of con
ventional restraints ; -we have only
to note these things to realize that
we have here, indeed, ready to
hand, the raw material for nniny a
rich unwritten chapter in the peren

nial comedie kumaine. Moreover,
in reckoning up conditions, we must
not forget the stimulating qualities
of our mental atmosphere itself.
No one, born and bred in other en
vironments, can live for a few years
in California without remarking
upon the intellectual traits which
characterize the younger genera
tions here —upon their eagerness,
curiosity, expansiveness, generous
sympathies, quick perception, and
instructive response to art. An
artist depends largely upon his
public; and to live in so bracing
an intellectual climate must count
for not a little in his work. And
finally, in the fact that we are here
comparatively free from some of
the cramping influences of puritan-

ism, we may venture to emphasize
another element, which should con
duce somewhat — perhaps materi
ally —to the large and liberal ex
pression of artistic power.
Let it We understood that, in
speaking in this way, I am not ac
cepting, even in its most general
application, Taine's famous and
much-abused formula of the race,
the milieu, and the moment. No
such formula—no formula of any
kind—will explain genius, or ac
count satisfactorily for its manifes
tations ; nor will the closest study
of intellectual conditions and social
forces enable us to indicate before
hand what form any new literature
will take, or whether, indeed, there
will be any new literature worth
talking about. After all, when the
so-called scientific—which is more
often than not a merely pseudo
scientific— method of investigating
literary phenomena, has done its

utmost, it still remains true that,
no matter how favorable the condi
tions, how rich the soil, how keen
the intellectual atmosphere, where
no great poet happens to be born,
we shall have no great poetry;
where no great novelist or dramatist
appears, we shall have no great fic
tion or drama. The wind bloweth
where it listeth.and we must await
the rise of the Creator, the true
maker, and be content to recognize
in his coming what for us must re
main—l do not baulk the word—a
miracle, all our philosophic formu
las notwithstanding. All 1 insist
upon is, that given the literary
genius, the man of insight and cre
ative power, then existing condi
tions here should in many ways be

distinctly favorable to his growth
and free expression. Heine once
remarked that ;i man should he
very careful in the choice of his
parents. In likewise, a poet or
novelist should he very careful
about the place and time of his ap
pearance upon this planet. And a
poet or novelist might certainly do
worse than to get himself born .-it
the moment in California, where,as
I have argued, he will find ample
stimulus and opportunity to work
out whatever power may he in him.
It is natural, therefore, that we,
whose privilege it is to help to
mould in some degree the destinies
of the rising generations, should
look with interest at these various
indications of possible future lit
erary activity, and that such in
terest should be particularly keen
in the case of those of us whose own
work lies on the literary side of the
higher education. And with us, at

all events, this interest is bound to
partake of a practical character.
Noting the signs as we must, and
speculating as we may upon their
value and significance, we are also
led to ask ourselves what we may
personally do—what the University
as an organ and center of culture
may do—to aid and direct the
fores out of which the literary
movements of the future will take
their rise.
In venturing to offer some sug
gestions by way of answer to this
question, 1 may conveniently begin
by laying stress 011 the fact that the
literary influence of the University
and its curriculum will necessarily
be almost wholly critical and dis
ciplinary in its character, By this
I mean that we, within academic
walls, must not nourish the illusory
hope of helping to any extent to
develop the creative spirit, or to
furnish productive strength and
quickening power. Indeed, I will
go so far as to assert that the atti
tude toward literature which is so
sedulously cultivated in our class
rooms, and which it is the main
part of our purpose to cultivate, is,
and always must he, the reverse of
favorable to creative effort. Ob
serve, that I do not now refer to the
unfortunate results which follow
when literature is badly taught—
results which are indeed common
enough, because literature is often
badly taught, but which are none
the less due to abuses in method
and system, and, as such, are not
inevitable. That many young men
and women go out from our col
leges. as many boys and girls go
out from our schools, not only with
out the slightest real apprehension
of the spirit and meaning of the
great masterpieces to which they
have been introduced, but even with
a positive aversion to such master
pieces. is of course a fact to be
deeply deplored. Hut such must
continue to be the main upshot of
our classroom training wherever
the reading of a great piece of lit
erature is made primarily a drill in
linguistics, a course is textual crit
icism, an occasion for the pouring
in of all sorts of general knowledge
—so long, in a word, as the true
ends of literary culture are delib
erately or ignorantly sacrificed to
the ends of so-called—and often
miscalled — scholarship. But all
such evil consequences of the grind
ing of the academic mills—Which,
like the mills of God, grind slowly,
but exceeding small — belong, as J
have said, to the region of abuses
only, and, therefore, need not now
detain us. The point that I now
wish to make goes deeper, and takes
us down to the first principles of
all our academic study of letters.
For, as a matter not of choice, but
of necessity, practically our whole
effort in the classroom is expended
in the training and strengthening
of the critical faculties —our point
of view throughout is the purely
critical pointof view. This cannot,
so far as 1 see, be otherwise. Yet
what is the result ? Literature
conies unavoidably to be regarded
by teachers whose lives are given
up entirely to this point of view,
and therefore by the students who
are brought under their influence,
as a caput mortuum for analysis

and dissection. We go to work
with carefully elaborated methods,
and in the spirit of the disinter
ested scientific inquirer ; we probe,
arrange, classify, generalize, for
mulate ; we discuss environment,
cause and affect, action and reac
tion, influences, schools. Far be it
from me to say that all these things
have not their place and value ;
though it is hard enough sometimes,
in the conduct of our investigations,
to make sure that the finer spirit,
the essential life, the delicate aroma
of literature, do not escape us in
the process. But l.do insist that
all this minute and painstaking
analytic study can at best be of
little service when it comes to the
actual making of literature, and
may sometimes be therein a positive
obstacle. We are only dealing with
commonplaces when we assert that
in the history of literature the crit
ical spirit has been hostile to cre
ative power; and, though no one
would deny that there are many
individual instances in which crit
ical spirit and creative power have
been combined, still, in the average
of cases, the cultivation of the one
must be at the expense of theother.
And as, in our classroom work, our
temper is critical, our standpoint
critical, I conceive that 1 have fully
justified my perhaps rather startling
proposition that the issue of our
labors is, and must necessarily be,
the reverse of favorable to creative
effort.
But all this is, after all, only the
negative view of our academic du
ties, privileges, and responsibilities.
To reach the positive view we have
only to consider the complementary
aspect of our general statement.
For if we say that our work must
be in the main critical and disci
plinary in character, what do we
imply by such a declaration? We
imply, to begin with, that we may
do much to guide and regulate cre
ative genius ; to prevent it from
stultifying itself by errors of judg
ment and mistaken ideals ; to save
it from wasting effort in fruitless
experiments. It has been well said
that an ordinary music-master may
be of much service even to an em
bryo Mozart by pointing out to him
certain things that he must not do,
and so holding him on the high
road to true achievement. And we
imply, moreover, that while we
may do this for the creative artist
himself, we may also aid him and
his work greatly in indirect ways
by our uplifting and enlightening
influence upon the reading public
to which he will make his appeal.
In estimating the duty which the
university owes to society in the
matter of literary culture, I should
say then that it is a large part of
our business to train up, and pass
out into the world, year by year, a
body of good, intelligent, apprecia
tive, and judicious readers, capable
of discriminating between the real
and the meretricious in literature,
and thus of rating the books which
are put before them at something
like their real worth.
Here, then, we reach a point de
serving the strongest emphasis. The
knowledge of literature and of the
history of literature, the clear in
sight and the critical judgment,
which it is our aim, in the Univer
sity classroom, to give and foster,
should yield that culture which in
itself is full of saving grace. In
other words, our ambition must be
to cultivate within our students,
through sympathetic contact with
the greatest and best things in the
literature of the world, a permanent
and high standard of artistic values
—a standard to which all literature
whatsoever may be brought for test.

Because in literature there are no
tinal objective criteria to refer to, it
is sometimes idly supposed that we
can have no stable or trustworthy
criteria at all : —it is all subjective,
we are told ; artistic excellence is
this to me and that to t.hee, and
there the matter must rest. Hut
in fact there is no more reason for
deciding questions of art upon the
opinion of the man in the street,
than there is for allowing him the
last word on questions of astronomy
or biology. Anolate France, vig
orously insisting that all literary
judgments must be merely personal,
once roundly declared that a critic,
to be honest, should say—not,
Gentlemen, I am to speak to you
about Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere ; but, Gentlemen, I am to
speak to you about myself in rela
tion to Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere. Within certain limits, 1
conceive this to be perfectly true.
But is there no distinction to be
made between the verdict of the
literary scholar, when he speaks of
himself in relation to Racine, Pas
cal, Shakspere, and that, let us say,
of the half-educated journalist man
ufacturing an article to order upon
himself in relation to the thinker or
the playwright ? Formal answer
to such a question is surely un
necessary. Though we may admit
the impossibility of establishing
exact objective touchstones, which
will be in the hands of the specialist,
but of which the ordinary individ
ual will know little or nothing—
though we must thus reject any
attempt to put our judgments on
the firm foundations of a science,
we are not, therefore, to regard crit
icism as reduced to anarchy —to a
chaos of feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. We insist upon the
fundamental differences in value
among feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. Jf the scientist re
fuses to take the conclusions of the
first man he meets concerning the
evidence for or against the trans
mission of acquired characters, we
just as emphatically refuse to take
the conclusions of the first man we
meet about the relative importance
of the novels of Jane Austen and
Archibald C. Gunter, or the worth
and significance of the writings of
Charles Lamb or Walter Pater.
No more in literature than in science
are we prepared to accept manhood
suffrage, and settle things by plebis
cite. Only those who know liter
ature in a large and generous way,
who have been in personal com
munion with the great writers of the
past and present, who have consid
ered, analyzed, compared, whose
perception has thus been trained,
whose judgment has thus been
matured —only such are really en
titled to a hearing in matters where
issues of artistic valuation are in
volved. Well, it is part of our duty
in the university to leaven the
reading mass of the public—the vo
racious, untrained, uncritical public
—with the leaven of the higher
culture, and so to send out into
society —not only through teachers
and journalists, but also in the
various walks of private life —lines
of influence which shall help to
raise the general taste, and thus
count positively for good.
Noting all this in a broad way,
we will now try to indicate one or
two special directions in which, as
regards both writers and their read
ers, such culture should be made to
tell.
One considerable danger by which
we who live in California are con
tinually threatened is the danger
which arises from our isolation. In
what ways this isolation affects for
ill the general life of the State, this

is not the place to inquire. Our
concern is simply with its bearings
upon literature ; and in literature,
its evil tendencies are sufficiently
marked. These may be summed
up in the one word —Provincial-
ism,—provincialism, with its ac
companying narrowness of aim and
purpose, of understanding and sym
pathy. Insularity, the French crit
ics are fond of insisting, is always
the prison of art ; and provin
cialism, it would be well for
us to remember, is only another
name for insularity. One would
have supposed that, at this time
of day, people would begin to
realize that the intellectual wel
fare and progress of any com
munity are best guaranteed and
subserved by broad, direct, and
constant contact with the thought
and feeling of the great outer world.
Yet so far is this from being our
case, that here provincialism is de
liberately fostered by the newspa
pers, and by a number of well
meaning but short-sighted theorists
who seem to regard aloofness, self
involution, and intellectual clan
nishness as the one certain means
of insuring individual independ
ence and free personal growth. In
this way we are asked to resuscitate
the exploded ideals of the days of
the Barlows and the Dwights, when,
as a protest against hated British
tyranny, the American writer
sought to break loose altogether
from British literary tradition in
style, method, even orthography ;
we are asked to repeat the demand
of Mr. Hathaway, in " Kaavnagh,"
for a "national literature" which
shall be "altogether shaggy and
unshorn " ; we are asked to adopt
the worst errors of Walt Whitman,
who, in order to show his dem
ocratic vigor and Americanism,
made wild critical assaults upon
Shakspere and Tennyson, and, with
a loud " go to !" set himself to man
ufacture, out of hand, a new litera
ture, fresh in principle,and without
indebtedness to the past. It is ade
quate literary culture that must save
us from such follies in the future,
as it was adequate literary culture —
in the person of Oliver Wendell
Holmes and a few other influential
men of the time —that saved Ainer
tcan literature from them half a
century ago. " I remember," says
Holmes' biographer, Mr. John T.
Morse, " I remember once hearing
a gentleman of some reputation in
literature say —actually in address
ing the Board of Overseers of a dis
tinguished seat of learning—that
he did not approve of teaching
young men to write 'good English,'
to use words accurately, and to
construct sentences gramatically ;
on the contrary, he said that he
wanted an infusion of the wild,
rough inaccuracies of the great new
West! He was," Mr. Morse con
tinues, " the victim of a foolish
notion, that one of the available
ways to show 'American independ
ence of England,' was by devising
a degraded dialect of the English
language for use in the United
States Nor was he alone in this
feeling . . . ; there was for a
while a wild pseudo-literary fad in
this direction. Dr. Holmes looked
upon it with disgust and indigna
tion, making his opinions known
with his usual outspoken courage,
and exemplifying them by his own
action, with the result that he was
for a while subjected to some abuse."
If today we all recognize the bene
ficial influence of Holmes' con
servatism, we should equally recog
nize the important part which such
conservatism —the conservatism of
culture —has still to play, particu
larly in our own western world.

I would not have it supposed that
I overlook the meaning and value
of provincialism, or fail to appre
ciate what is vital and significant,
for example, beneath the strain,
the conscious posturings, the affecta
tions and perversities of Whitman's
work. Literary history shows
clearly enough that, during periods
which tend to formalism and con
vention, provincialism has often
done splendid work by bringing
new material and new blood into
art. The provincial movement is,
for exam[de, to be reckoned one of
the potent generative forces in the
romantic developments of the latter
half of the eighteenth century. Hut
literary history also shows with
equal clearness how futile and un
profitable provincialism always be
comes when it rests mainly on its
sense of newness and isolation —
when it refuses to relate itseif in
direct and healthy contact with
the best things in the world outside
and the transmitted culture of by
gone ages. Many a man of real
genius and promise has fallen short
of effective utterance by wandering
off after some spectral ambition of
originality ; many a fresh move
ment has come to naught because
it has cut itself loose from culture,
and has sought its purpose and its
field in narrow aims and parochial
interests. One of our younger gen
eration of writers has constituted
himself the spokesman and evan
gelist of what lie calls the libera
tion of the "great West." Accord
ing to him, the first important
thing for the "great West" to do
in literature is—to get itself "eman
cipated." Incidentally we might
suggest that the first important
thing for the "great West," or for
any other part of the world, to do
in literature, is to write great books ;
and that it is extremely doubtful
whether any really valuable output
of literature was ever yet heralded
or helped by clamorous and hys
terical demands for emancipation.
Hut these are points which we may
at present leave undiscussed. Con
cerning what Mr. Hamlin Garland
means by emancipation, however,
we need not remain in doubt. The
day of the East —the day of foreign
influence, according to him —is over,
or should be over. In this fact
lies our hope of "emancipation."
The past —the phrase is bis own
"is not vital " ; we must abandon
-the phrase is again his own—its
"crumbling idols"; we must break
once and for all with its traditions,
methods, usages. Now all this is
simply provincialism run mad —
fanatical provincialism, asserting
its own unreason and rejoicing in
it. Let the " great West " manifest
its spirit in literature, by all means;
let it find its own way ; let it
deal freshly with its magnificent
fresh material ; let it build its own
edifice, if necessary, in its own
chosen style of architecture. If it
succeeds, it will succeed because its
work is good, sound, valid —not be
cause it is wrought in an anti-feudal
spirit, or with any dogmatic inten
tion of "emancipating" itself from
anything or anybody. Hut we may
be sure of this —that such work will
not lie done the better or the more
effectively —that it will never be
helped, and may be seriously
marred, and even invalidated—by
being conceived in a boastful tem
per, and planned and carried
through in reckless ignorance of
what has succeeded and what
has failed in the past. When
Mr. Garland himself gives us his
stories of prairie life, we are in
terested, we are moved and stirred,
not because they are examples of
"emancipated" literature, but be
cause, after all, they have in them
some measure of the true life which
has secured pemanence and univer
sality —for all literature worth the
name, from the Book of Job
and the Homeric Epos down
to "The Man Who Was"and
" Madame Delphine." The first
and last aim of the artist
should be to endue his own work
with something of this true life. If
he fail to do so, of what service to
him or to us will be his Declaration
of Independence? If he succeed,
he need not trouble himself about
"emancipation," and rest assured
that we, his readers, will not trouble
ourselves about it in our turn.
What a relief it is, then, to turn
from the crude dogmatism of Mr.
Garland to the wise words of one
who knows literature as a scholar
and feels it as a poet. " Shakspere's
creations," writes Mr. Stedman,
"have been pronounced outworn"
—Shakspere being, of course, one of
the "crumbling idols" handed down
to us from a past which is not
"vital"—"have been pronounced
outworn, because he was the last
great 'poet of feudalism.' We
might as well say that the truth to
human life displayed in Genesis or
Exodus, or the synthetic beauty of
the Parthenon, or the glory (if the
Sistine Madonna, will grow inef
fective, forgetting that these have
the vitality which appertains to the
lasting nature of things. No poet
can ever outrival Shakspere"—can
ever take the place of that "crum
bling idol " —" except by a more ex
ceeding insight and utterance. It is
well said that great art is always
modern." And again, with what
pleasure do we acknowledge the
admirable common sense of some
remarks of another critical master
(who in such matters rarely fails to
hit the mark), concerning the so
called "Irish literary movement,"
which once again is only another
illustration of the outworkings of
the spirit of Provincialism. "J
confess," says Professor Dowden,
"that I am not ambitious of inten
sifying my intellectual or spiritual
brogue. . . . No folly can be
greater than that of fancying
that we shall strengthen our lit
erary position by living exclu
sively in our own ideas" —
that is, by "emancipating" our
selves —"and showing ourselves in
hospitable to the best ideas of other
lands" —and, we may add, of that
great past, which, the "emanci
pated" tell us, is no longer "vital."
And Professor Dowden adds one
most significant remark. "Every
great literary movement of modern
Kurope," be reminds us, "has been
born from the wedlock of two peo
ples." Should not this fact suggest
to us —to those of us, at all events,
who are not so thoroughly emanci
pated as to care nothing for the
teachings of history—that complete
emancipation might after all mean
— complete sterility ?
Hut if we need emancipation, it
is surely emancipation from such
clogging and paralyzing provincial
ism ; and this emancipation we
should help to accomplish in the
university classroom, and by uni
versity culture. Knowledge of the
best in literature that the world
has produced—the fineness of in
sight and the certainty of taste
which are developed by personal
contact with the vital and enduring
elements in the great books of past
and present: these things are what
we need always and everywhere—
and need more than ever today
and here in California—if we would
save ourselves from the perversion
of effort and the waste of power. A
man who has learned to appreciate

and feel what its vital and enduring
in the literature of Greece, England,
Italy, France, Germany —who has
been brought, let us say, under the
discipline of Sophocles, Shakspere,
Dante, Voltaire, Goethe —will have
been swept so far into the great
main current of culture, that he
will be in little danger of being
caught up in momentary eddies, or
washed into obscure backwater of
the stream. In such a school, we
learn to see things in their right
relations, estimate them by true
and permanent standards of value,
and put them into their proper
places.
And how sadly the power to do
this is needed just at present is
made manifest when we observe
the terrible lack of any sense of
proportion and perspective ex
hibited in newspaper reviews,
in magazine articles, in com
mon judgments about books and
authors hastily struck out in
conversation or more deliberately
registered in print. Look for a
moment at our whole modern
business of book-reviewing—note
its conspicuous short-comings—and
ask honestly what for the most part
it is really worth. I do not wish
to seem hard or querulous in my
censure; but in its more popular
forms, at any rate, is it for the most
part really worth anything at all ?
A reviewer, in virtue of his official
position, is supposed (and if this
be but a supposition, then so much
the worse for thefact) —is supposed
to guide and check public opinion
about things of which he is sup
posed (and again if this be but a
supposition, then so much the worse
for the fact), to know more than
the general reader ; it is, by the
hypothesis, his special function to
offer opinions which will help, di
rect, enlighten. Hut in the larger
proportion of cases, is this function
fultilled ? Does the magazine ar
ticle, does the newspaper criticism,
really guide or check, help, direct,
enlighten ? To put the question
in this downright fashion is surely
to answer it. And the worst aspect
of the matter is not, after all, that
article and criticism are so often
evidently the work of men who do
not in the least understand what
they are talking about. That is
bad enough, of course ; but the as
sertions of mere ignorance are, 1
take it, less subtly and less con
stantly dangerous than the distor
tion of critical vision commonly
exhibited even by men who take
their work seriously, write with
more than ordinary care, and show
a laudable desire to say something
to the point. A new novel is pub
lished —a book perhaps with many
admirable qualities and well de
serving a word of cordial recogni
tion. We turn to a notice of it in
a paper or magazine, and we find
the reviewer almost beside himself
in a frenzy of wonder and excite
ment. The work is hailed as a mas
terpiece, the author pronounced on
the spot a writer beside whom—if
we are to take his language at its
liberal meaning—Scott, Balzac,
Thackeray, are as prattling chil
dren. A year or two goes by ; the
great book and the great author
disappear from sight, or drop back
into the rank of the ephemerals;
and the critic, who seems never to
learn by experience, cheerfully and
unblushingiy breaks forth into an
other paeon over the arrival of an
other masterpiece, from the pen of
another genius ot the first, order.
What, we say in our confusion, is
it possible that there are really so
many Scotts, and Balzacs, and
Thackerays about ? Does the spread
of democracy mean that hereafter

geniuses are to l>e plenty as black
berries ? Or why all this fuss ?
And then we recall Browning's
legate who had lived to see —and
see out —four and twenty leaders of
revolt. But though there are moods
in which we may find passing
amusement in the situation, it is
but passing amusement, after all.
For if we are truly in earnest about
literature, all this laxity of critical
opinion must necessarily alarm us,
since we cannot blind ourselves
to the danger—the great and se
rious danger — inherent in our
wholesale abandonment of high
standards and the consequent vitia
tion of public tas-te. And where,
we ask, is any corrective to be
sought ? It must be sought in such
knowledge and insight as are given,
in such discipline and breadth of
view as are afforded, by the culture
of the university classroom. It is
not, indeed, to be argued that any
amount of university training will
of itself make a reviewer conscien
tious in the performance of his diffi
cult and sometimes delicate duty—
especially in these days when even
reputable publishers seek to bias
his mind and "inspire" his utter
ances. But such training will most
certainly give some sense of meas
ure, some feeling fur proportion,
some realization of what has and
what has not substantial claims
upon attention ; and in virtue of
these gains, a man's work as critic,
as leader of opinion, will neces
sarily become more temperate, more
intelligent, more helpful.
And to the culture and training
of the university classroom again,
we have mainly to look for a much
needed check upon yet another ten
dency of our time more widespread
and more generally pernicious than
any yet referred to. The evil of
which we now come to speak is not
local, or of sudden growth ; it per
vades almost the entire reading
world ; and it has developed grad
ually out of the changing social
conditions of the past fifty or sixty
years. I have in mind,as you will
have anticipated, the enormous re
cent growth of periodical litera
ture, and the intellectual results
which are now beginning to be rec
ognized as arising from our ever
increasing dependence upon it.
Ours is, we are often told, em
phatically a, reading age. 1 do not
deny this; indeed, if we consider
only the number of lines of print
per capita actually consumed by
our population, day by day, year
by year, no other age in history
has had such a claim to the dis
tincti >n. But it is, 1 am afraid, at
the same time an age of rapid read
ing, superficial reading, thoughtless
reading —of the kind of reading
which dissipates the energies, un
dermines the power of attention,
and plays havoc with the mind.
Coleridge long ago classed the con
stant perusal of periodicals among
anti-mnemonics, or destroyers of
memory, and looked with dread at
the growth of the magazine and
newspaper habit. If he was
alarmed, what should our feelings
be ? Step into a bookstore in the
early part of the month, and
turn over the magazines, just out,
and freshly exposed for sale, in all
the meretricious attractiveness of
elaborate covers, designed to arrest
the wandering eye. There they are
— ranged in picturesque rows —
pretentious, unpretentious—cheap,
dear —good, bad, indifferent; some
professing literary excellence—some
frankly abandoning all title to any
thing of the kind. Now, of course,
these publications vary in worth as
widely as they differ in their styles ;
and it would be unjust to lump

tliem together, and dismiss them all
with a single \rord of condemnation.
But what is the general impression
they leave upon us when we view
them in the lot ? It is not a pleas
ant impression,certainly. What a
mass of rubbish goes to the mak
ing of these monthly concoctions !
How poor —how unspeakably poor
—is, on the average, the stuff which
they set before their buyers ? How
little in any one of them are we
likely to find what will stand the
test of a second thoughtful reading !
Many of them are scarcely more
than picture-books—collections of
photogravures and the like, accom
panied by some weak explanatory
letter-press ; in most of them, again,
as is natural in an age which has
an unworthy passion for personal
ities, large space is given to portraits
of distinguished or notorious peo
ple, and to the catchpenny gossip
about them which, true or false, is
always held safe to amuse an idle
half-hour. Even, 1 grieve to say,
in our so-called literary magazines
—in periodicals directly devoted to
literature and its interests — the
same childish tendencies are to be
found encroaching on every side.
Here, too, we have not only ac
counts of new publications, and the
information we properly desire to
gain about current affairs in the
book world ; we have also pictures
of all the new rivals of Scott, Balzac,
and Thackeray—of their fathers,
mothers, uncles, and aunts —of
their places of birth and residence
— facsimiles from their manu
scripts, scraps from their letters,
and details innumerable about their
private lives and methods of work
—whether, for instance, they are
married or single, write the more
fluently before breakfast or at mid
night, prefer coffee or tea, golfing or
boating —with other such matter
of manifest importance in the
study of their books. All this is
positively painful. And if a little
serious consideration of our maga
zines fills ns with misapprehen
sion, what shall we say about
our newspapers ? —about our Sun
day newspapers particularly, which
themselves aspire to take rank as
magazines? What shall we say?
Perhaps it will be safest not to at
tempt to say anything. It would
be hard to do justice to such a
subject.
The bearings of our growing habit
of miscellaneous reading upon our
mental life and through this upon
real literature, have been admirably
described by a couple of writers,
whose words will carry so much
more weight than my own, that I
will ask you to listen to them in my
behalf.
Says Charles Dudley Warner : —
"The habit of excessive newspaper
reading, in which a great variety of
topics is inadequately treated, has
a curious effect on the mind. It
becomes demoralized, gradually
loses the power of concentration
or of continuous thought, and even
loses the inclination to read the
long articles which the newspaper
prints. The eye catches a thousand
things, but is detained by no
one. . . . The effect of this
scrappy desultory reading is bad
enough when the hashed compound
selected is tolerably good. It be
comes a very serious matter when
the reading itself is vapid, frivolous,
or bad. The responsibility of se
lecting the mental food for millions
of people is serious. When, in the
last century, in England, the So
ciety for the Diffusion of Useful In
formation, which accomplished so
much good, was organized, this re
sponsibility was felt, and competent
hands prepared the popular books
and pamphlets. . . . Now, it
happens that a hundred thousand
people, perhaps a million in some
cases, surrender the right of the all
important selection of food for their
minds to some unknown and irre
sponsible person whose business it
is to choose the miscellaneous read
ing-matter for a particular news-

paper. His or her taste may he
good, or it may he immature and
vicious ; it may he used simply to
create a sensation ; and yet the
million of readers get nothing ex
cept what this one person chooses
they shall read . . . Day after
day, Sunday after Sunday, they
read only what this unknown per
son selects for them. Instead of
going to the library and cultivating
their own tastes, and pursuing some
subject that will increase their
mental vigor and add to their per
manent stock of thought, they frit
ter away their time upon a hash of
literature chopped up for them by
a person possibly very unfit even
to make a good hash. The mere
statement of this surrender of one's
judgment of what shall be his in
tellectual life, is alarming."
1 have now indicated a few of
the directions in which the aca
demic study of literature should lie
made to count in the interests of
literature itself. It might perhaps
be expected that I should now say
something about the hearings of my
arguments upon our own classroom
work. Hut as any detailed discus
sion of methods would he here out
of place, I shall content myself, in
conclusion, with touching briefly
upon a couple of inferences the im
portance of which will, I trust, be
field to justify the emphasis I de
sire to throw upon them.
The broad view which I have
throughout taken of our university
responsibilities rests, of course, upon
an equally broad conception of the
literary training which it is one of
our chief objects to afford ; and
this in turn implies a distinction
between general literary culture on
the one hand, and what we techni
cally call scholarship on the other.
Here, then, in the University we
who deal witn literature have a
two-fold duty resting upon us — to
train the few as specialists, and to
help the many in the higher cul
ture of their lives ; and I maintain
that in our curriculum we should
keep these separate ends separately
in view. The future specialist
must rightly be asked to spend

j many laborious hours among minor
writers and relatively uninteresting
periods, in lines of minute investi
gation, in questions of detailed
| classification and analysis. But
meanwhile the general student
comes to us with but little energy
i available for a subject which for him
belongs now and will always be
long to the margin of his activities.
Well, under the circumstances

we cannot hope to make a scholar
of him ; we can at best give him
only a smattering of knowledge, an
imperfect conception of critical me
thods and results ; and while we
are doing this by putting him
through some part of the routine
adapted to the specialist, we are
wasting time which might be more
profitably spent in other ways,and,
it is more than probable, are culti
vating a false idea of literature and
a habit of mind which will present
ly be not helpful but injurious.
Professor Minto was right in as
serting that the study of English
literature could be made for all
students as severe a discipline as
the study of the classics; but he was
also right in adding that in the vast
majority of cases people are not
apt to find much subsequent satis
faction in the things which have
been used mainly as a training for
their minds. And in the vast ma
jority of cases, not mental discipline
purchased at the price of disen
chantment, but the development of
a large and living interest in litera
ture, is the mark at which we
should aim. How is it, I have
often been forced to ask myself,
that we often find such a fresh
spontaneous delight in literature
among men and women who have
never been through our university
courses ; while among so many who
havehad the advantage of our criti
cal drill and direction increased
knowledge has brought with it
apathy and indifference ? Mow is
it that while the student may know
so much more about a play of
Shakspere's, it is the outsider who
still, in a broad human way, feels
its passion and its power the more
intensely and thus gets really so
! much more out of it? We must
j admit that there is something rad
ically wrong somewhere when the
i academic study of literature is so
frequently equivalent to intellect
ual vaccination : one has a slight
attack, superinduced by artificial
means, and is thereby safeguarded
from any serious trouble of the
same kind in times to come. The
evil, I am bold to say, is largely

due to the wholesale sacrifice of
general culture to special scholar
ship ; and this, again, is in great
measure the outcome of the en
croachment upon literature of the
scientific spirit. We hear over
much novv-a-days of the need of
studying literature scientifically.
Now this notion of studying litera
ture scientifically means either
something which is neither very
new nor very remarkable, or some
thing against which it is our duty
to enter a vigorous protest. If it
means that in dealing with litera
ture and the history of literature,
we must he careful to know our
facts, see them steadily, set them in
their proper relationships, then no
one would complain : all this, I say,
is neither very new nor very re
markable. But if, on the other
hand, it means that the analytical
spirit and method of science — the
laboratory spirit and method — are
to he applied to the subject-matter
of literature, — if it means this, and
the consequent abandonment of the
true spirit and method of literature
itself —then surely the time has
come for those of us who believe in
literature as much as we believe in
science, to place ourselves at the
doors of our lecture-rooms, and
courageously bar the way. Litera
ture is not science, any more than
science is literature ; and the true
lines of approach to one and the
other subject differ as widely as the
aims and purposes of the subjects
themselves. Why, then, the scienti
fic study of literature, any more
than the literary study of science ?
As we demand the scientific study
of science, so we demand the liter
ary study of literature ; and the
literary study of literature means
something more than scholarship
— something more than the most
minute and accurate knowledge of
books, writers, dates, influences, the
evolution of forms and schools ; it
means the reaching of the brain

and soul of ail author and his work.
We may freely admit the practical
difficulty to which we are intro
duced when we conceive the matter
thus ;'for you may get twenty teach
ers of scientific method and scho
larship for one who himself feels
the inner spirit of literature and
has the power of bringing others to
feel it with him. But, all practi
cal difficulty notwithstanding, the
true ideals of literary culture
must still he setup in our lecture
rooms if our work there is to he
filled with the real life of thespirit,
and if we are to do our part in help
ing forward the higher civilization
of the great outer world.

Of all forms of mistake, (Jeorge
Eliot somewhere remarks, prophecy
is the most gratuitous. With such
a word of warning well in mind, I
would not wish to make this an oc
casion for indulging myself in any
rash predictions concerning what,
in the way of literature, the future
may or may not have in store. But
for those of us whose business it is
to pay some attention to the social
and intellectual conditions which,
at different times in the world's
history, have favored the free and
effective play of artistic genius, it
is only natural, 1 suppose, to turn
analysis occasionally from the
things of the past upon the circum
stances of our own time and place.
And if, as a result of such analysis,we
are led to speculate a litte curiously
on the possibility of fresh artistic
developments in years to come, we
may perhaps be allowed to do so
without protest, on the understand
ing that we are concerned only with
possibilities, and that we fully rec
ognize how frequently in such mat
ters the most carefully formed
hypotheses may he brought to
naught by the sudden irruption of
factors which have eluded scrutiny
or defied formulation.
Unless the signs of the times are
altogether misleading, therefore, I i
cannot but feel we have legiti
mate cause to believe that in the
not far distant future we may wit
ness, here on the Pacific Coast, the
beginnings of a literary movement
as distinct in character, as racy,
and in its kind as interesting and
valuable as that which, by the
middle of our century, had won
abiding glory for New England.
For here—as the most superficial
observation of the facts and condi-1
tions of California life should suf
fice to show us —the creative artist
of tomorrow — be he poet, novelist,
or dramatist- will find himself in
a new world of rare and splendid
opportunity. Think for a moment
of the stirring story of our still im
mediate past: —a story teeming with
records of adventure, of turbulence,
and violence, and conflict, of prim
itive passions, of bizarre achieve
ments and failures, of dramatic
crises, and the gradual building of
social order out of lawlessness and
confusion. There surely is a mass i
of moving incident and picturesque'
character as genuinely romantic
and as profoundly human as that
upon which the genius of Scott was
privileged to draw in the history
and legends of the Border. Nor
will the social field of today prove
a whit less fertile in theme and in
spiration. We have only to note
the striking vigor and diversity of
our western life—the cosmopolitan
ism which has resulted both from
the clash and from the blending of
races —the startling contrasts in
social types and ideals —the fresh
ness of the manhood and woman
hood fostered by our abounding
personal freedom and lack of con
ventional restraints ; -we have only
to note these things to realize that
we have here, indeed, ready to
hand, the raw material for nniny a
rich unwritten chapter in the peren

nial comedie kumaine. Moreover,
in reckoning up conditions, we must
not forget the stimulating qualities
of our mental atmosphere itself.
No one, born and bred in other en
vironments, can live for a few years
in California without remarking
upon the intellectual traits which
characterize the younger genera
tions here —upon their eagerness,
curiosity, expansiveness, generous
sympathies, quick perception, and
instructive response to art. An
artist depends largely upon his
public; and to live in so bracing
an intellectual climate must count
for not a little in his work. And
finally, in the fact that we are here
comparatively free from some of
the cramping influences of puritan-

ism, we may venture to emphasize
another element, which should con
duce somewhat — perhaps materi
ally —to the large and liberal ex
pression of artistic power.
Let it We understood that, in
speaking in this way, I am not ac
cepting, even in its most general
application, Taine's famous and
much-abused formula of the race,
the milieu, and the moment. No
such formula—no formula of any
kind—will explain genius, or ac
count satisfactorily for its manifes
tations ; nor will the closest study
of intellectual conditions and social
forces enable us to indicate before
hand what form any new literature
will take, or whether, indeed, there
will be any new literature worth
talking about. After all, when the
so-called scientific—which is more
often than not a merely pseudo
scientific— method of investigating
literary phenomena, has done its

utmost, it still remains true that,
no matter how favorable the condi
tions, how rich the soil, how keen
the intellectual atmosphere, where
no great poet happens to be born,
we shall have no great poetry;
where no great novelist or dramatist
appears, we shall have no great fic
tion or drama. The wind bloweth
where it listeth.and we must await
the rise of the Creator, the true
maker, and be content to recognize
in his coming what for us must re
main—l do not baulk the word—a
miracle, all our philosophic formu
las notwithstanding. All 1 insist
upon is, that given the literary
genius, the man of insight and cre
ative power, then existing condi
tions here should in many ways be

distinctly favorable to his growth
and free expression. Heine once
remarked that ;i man should he
very careful in the choice of his
parents. In likewise, a poet or
novelist should he very careful
about the place and time of his ap
pearance upon this planet. And a
poet or novelist might certainly do
worse than to get himself born .-it
the moment in California, where,as
I have argued, he will find ample
stimulus and opportunity to work
out whatever power may he in him.
It is natural, therefore, that we,
whose privilege it is to help to
mould in some degree the destinies
of the rising generations, should
look with interest at these various
indications of possible future lit
erary activity, and that such in
terest should be particularly keen
in the case of those of us whose own
work lies on the literary side of the
higher education. And with us, at

all events, this interest is bound to
partake of a practical character.
Noting the signs as we must, and
speculating as we may upon their
value and significance, we are also
led to ask ourselves what we may
personally do—what the University
as an organ and center of culture
may do—to aid and direct the
fores out of which the literary
movements of the future will take
their rise.
In venturing to offer some sug
gestions by way of answer to this
question, 1 may conveniently begin
by laying stress 011 the fact that the
literary influence of the University
and its curriculum will necessarily
be almost wholly critical and dis
ciplinary in its character, By this
I mean that we, within academic
walls, must not nourish the illusory
hope of helping to any extent to
develop the creative spirit, or to
furnish productive strength and
quickening power. Indeed, I will
go so far as to assert that the atti
tude toward literature which is so
sedulously cultivated in our class
rooms, and which it is the main
part of our purpose to cultivate, is,
and always must he, the reverse of
favorable to creative effort. Ob
serve, that I do not now refer to the
unfortunate results which follow
when literature is badly taught—
results which are indeed common
enough, because literature is often
badly taught, but which are none
the less due to abuses in method
and system, and, as such, are not
inevitable. That many young men
and women go out from our col
leges. as many boys and girls go
out from our schools, not only with
out the slightest real apprehension
of the spirit and meaning of the
great masterpieces to which they
have been introduced, but even with
a positive aversion to such master
pieces. is of course a fact to be
deeply deplored. Hut such must
continue to be the main upshot of
our classroom training wherever
the reading of a great piece of lit
erature is made primarily a drill in
linguistics, a course is textual crit
icism, an occasion for the pouring
in of all sorts of general knowledge
—so long, in a word, as the true
ends of literary culture are delib
erately or ignorantly sacrificed to
the ends of so-called—and often
miscalled — scholarship. But all
such evil consequences of the grind
ing of the academic mills—Which,
like the mills of God, grind slowly,
but exceeding small — belong, as J
have said, to the region of abuses
only, and, therefore, need not now
detain us. The point that I now
wish to make goes deeper, and takes
us down to the first principles of
all our academic study of letters.
For, as a matter not of choice, but
of necessity, practically our whole
effort in the classroom is expended
in the training and strengthening
of the critical faculties —our point
of view throughout is the purely
critical pointof view. This cannot,
so far as 1 see, be otherwise. Yet
what is the result ? Literature
conies unavoidably to be regarded
by teachers whose lives are given
up entirely to this point of view,
and therefore by the students who
are brought under their influence,
as a caput mortuum for analysis

and dissection. We go to work
with carefully elaborated methods,
and in the spirit of the disinter
ested scientific inquirer ; we probe,
arrange, classify, generalize, for
mulate ; we discuss environment,
cause and affect, action and reac
tion, influences, schools. Far be it
from me to say that all these things
have not their place and value ;
though it is hard enough sometimes,
in the conduct of our investigations,
to make sure that the finer spirit,
the essential life, the delicate aroma
of literature, do not escape us in
the process. But l.do insist that
all this minute and painstaking
analytic study can at best be of
little service when it comes to the
actual making of literature, and
may sometimes be therein a positive
obstacle. We are only dealing with
commonplaces when we assert that
in the history of literature the crit
ical spirit has been hostile to cre
ative power; and, though no one
would deny that there are many
individual instances in which crit
ical spirit and creative power have
been combined, still, in the average
of cases, the cultivation of the one
must be at the expense of theother.
And as, in our classroom work, our
temper is critical, our standpoint
critical, I conceive that 1 have fully
justified my perhaps rather startling
proposition that the issue of our
labors is, and must necessarily be,
the reverse of favorable to creative
effort.
But all this is, after all, only the
negative view of our academic du
ties, privileges, and responsibilities.
To reach the positive view we have
only to consider the complementary
aspect of our general statement.
For if we say that our work must
be in the main critical and disci
plinary in character, what do we
imply by such a declaration? We
imply, to begin with, that we may
do much to guide and regulate cre
ative genius ; to prevent it from
stultifying itself by errors of judg
ment and mistaken ideals ; to save
it from wasting effort in fruitless
experiments. It has been well said
that an ordinary music-master may
be of much service even to an em
bryo Mozart by pointing out to him
certain things that he must not do,
and so holding him on the high
road to true achievement. And we
imply, moreover, that while we
may do this for the creative artist
himself, we may also aid him and
his work greatly in indirect ways
by our uplifting and enlightening
influence upon the reading public
to which he will make his appeal.
In estimating the duty which the
university owes to society in the
matter of literary culture, I should
say then that it is a large part of
our business to train up, and pass
out into the world, year by year, a
body of good, intelligent, apprecia
tive, and judicious readers, capable
of discriminating between the real
and the meretricious in literature,
and thus of rating the books which
are put before them at something
like their real worth.
Here, then, we reach a point de
serving the strongest emphasis. The
knowledge of literature and of the
history of literature, the clear in
sight and the critical judgment,
which it is our aim, in the Univer
sity classroom, to give and foster,
should yield that culture which in
itself is full of saving grace. In
other words, our ambition must be
to cultivate within our students,
through sympathetic contact with
the greatest and best things in the
literature of the world, a permanent
and high standard of artistic values
—a standard to which all literature
whatsoever may be brought for test.

Because in literature there are no
tinal objective criteria to refer to, it
is sometimes idly supposed that we
can have no stable or trustworthy
criteria at all : —it is all subjective,
we are told ; artistic excellence is
this to me and that to t.hee, and
there the matter must rest. Hut
in fact there is no more reason for
deciding questions of art upon the
opinion of the man in the street,
than there is for allowing him the
last word on questions of astronomy
or biology. Anolate France, vig
orously insisting that all literary
judgments must be merely personal,
once roundly declared that a critic,
to be honest, should say—not,
Gentlemen, I am to speak to you
about Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere ; but, Gentlemen, I am to
speak to you about myself in rela
tion to Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere. Within certain limits, 1
conceive this to be perfectly true.
But is there no distinction to be
made between the verdict of the
literary scholar, when he speaks of
himself in relation to Racine, Pas
cal, Shakspere, and that, let us say,
of the half-educated journalist man
ufacturing an article to order upon
himself in relation to the thinker or
the playwright ? Formal answer
to such a question is surely un
necessary. Though we may admit
the impossibility of establishing
exact objective touchstones, which
will be in the hands of the specialist,
but of which the ordinary individ
ual will know little or nothing—
though we must thus reject any
attempt to put our judgments on
the firm foundations of a science,
we are not, therefore, to regard crit
icism as reduced to anarchy —to a
chaos of feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. We insist upon the
fundamental differences in value
among feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. Jf the scientist re
fuses to take the conclusions of the
first man he meets concerning the
evidence for or against the trans
mission of acquired characters, we
just as emphatically refuse to take
the conclusions of the first man we
meet about the relative importance
of the novels of Jane Austen and
Archibald C. Gunter, or the worth
and significance of the writings of
Charles Lamb or Walter Pater.
No more in literature than in science
are we prepared to accept manhood
suffrage, and settle things by plebis
cite. Only those who know liter
ature in a large and generous way,
who have been in personal com
munion with the great writers of the
past and present, who have consid
ered, analyzed, compared, whose
perception has thus been trained,
whose judgment has thus been
matured —only such are really en
titled to a hearing in matters where
issues of artistic valuation are in
volved. Well, it is part of our duty
in the university to leaven the
reading mass of the public—the vo
racious, untrained, uncritical public
—with the leaven of the higher
culture, and so to send out into
society —not only through teachers
and journalists, but also in the
various walks of private life —lines
of influence which shall help to
raise the general taste, and thus
count positively for good.
Noting all this in a broad way,
we will now try to indicate one or
two special directions in which, as
regards both writers and their read
ers, such culture should be made to
tell.
One considerable danger by which
we who live in California are con
tinually threatened is the danger
which arises from our isolation. In
what ways this isolation affects for
ill the general life of the State, this

is not the place to inquire. Our
concern is simply with its bearings
upon literature ; and in literature,
its evil tendencies are sufficiently
marked. These may be summed
up in the one word —Provincial-
ism,—provincialism, with its ac
companying narrowness of aim and
purpose, of understanding and sym
pathy. Insularity, the French crit
ics are fond of insisting, is always
the prison of art ; and provin
cialism, it would be well for
us to remember, is only another
name for insularity. One would
have supposed that, at this time
of day, people would begin to
realize that the intellectual wel
fare and progress of any com
munity are best guaranteed and
subserved by broad, direct, and
constant contact with the thought
and feeling of the great outer world.
Yet so far is this from being our
case, that here provincialism is de
liberately fostered by the newspa
pers, and by a number of well
meaning but short-sighted theorists
who seem to regard aloofness, self
involution, and intellectual clan
nishness as the one certain means
of insuring individual independ
ence and free personal growth. In
this way we are asked to resuscitate
the exploded ideals of the days of
the Barlows and the Dwights, when,
as a protest against hated British
tyranny, the American writer
sought to break loose altogether
from British literary tradition in
style, method, even orthography ;
we are asked to repeat the demand
of Mr. Hathaway, in " Kaavnagh,"
for a "national literature" which
shall be "altogether shaggy and
unshorn " ; we are asked to adopt
the worst errors of Walt Whitman,
who, in order to show his dem
ocratic vigor and Americanism,
made wild critical assaults upon
Shakspere and Tennyson, and, with
a loud " go to !" set himself to man
ufacture, out of hand, a new litera
ture, fresh in principle,and without
indebtedness to the past. It is ade
quate literary culture that must save
us from such follies in the future,
as it was adequate literary culture —
in the person of Oliver Wendell
Holmes and a few other influential
men of the time —that saved Ainer
tcan literature from them half a
century ago. " I remember," says
Holmes' biographer, Mr. John T.
Morse, " I remember once hearing
a gentleman of some reputation in
literature say —actually in address
ing the Board of Overseers of a dis
tinguished seat of learning—that
he did not approve of teaching
young men to write 'good English,'
to use words accurately, and to
construct sentences gramatically ;
on the contrary, he said that he
wanted an infusion of the wild,
rough inaccuracies of the great new
West! He was," Mr. Morse con
tinues, " the victim of a foolish
notion, that one of the available
ways to show 'American independ
ence of England,' was by devising
a degraded dialect of the English
language for use in the United
States Nor was he alone in this
feeling . . . ; there was for a
while a wild pseudo-literary fad in
this direction. Dr. Holmes looked
upon it with disgust and indigna
tion, making his opinions known
with his usual outspoken courage,
and exemplifying them by his own
action, with the result that he was
for a while subjected to some abuse."
If today we all recognize the bene
ficial influence of Holmes' con
servatism, we should equally recog
nize the important part which such
conservatism —the conservatism of
culture —has still to play, particu
larly in our own western world.

I would not have it supposed that
I overlook the meaning and value
of provincialism, or fail to appre
ciate what is vital and significant,
for example, beneath the strain,
the conscious posturings, the affecta
tions and perversities of Whitman's
work. Literary history shows
clearly enough that, during periods
which tend to formalism and con
vention, provincialism has often
done splendid work by bringing
new material and new blood into
art. The provincial movement is,
for exam[de, to be reckoned one of
the potent generative forces in the
romantic developments of the latter
half of the eighteenth century. Hut
literary history also shows with
equal clearness how futile and un
profitable provincialism always be
comes when it rests mainly on its
sense of newness and isolation —
when it refuses to relate itseif in
direct and healthy contact with
the best things in the world outside
and the transmitted culture of by
gone ages. Many a man of real
genius and promise has fallen short
of effective utterance by wandering
off after some spectral ambition of
originality ; many a fresh move
ment has come to naught because
it has cut itself loose from culture,
and has sought its purpose and its
field in narrow aims and parochial
interests. One of our younger gen
eration of writers has constituted
himself the spokesman and evan
gelist of what lie calls the libera
tion of the "great West." Accord
ing to him, the first important
thing for the "great West" to do
in literature is—to get itself "eman
cipated." Incidentally we might
suggest that the first important
thing for the "great West," or for
any other part of the world, to do
in literature, is to write great books ;
and that it is extremely doubtful
whether any really valuable output
of literature was ever yet heralded
or helped by clamorous and hys
terical demands for emancipation.
Hut these are points which we may
at present leave undiscussed. Con
cerning what Mr. Hamlin Garland
means by emancipation, however,
we need not remain in doubt. The
day of the East —the day of foreign
influence, according to him —is over,
or should be over. In this fact
lies our hope of "emancipation."
The past —the phrase is bis own
"is not vital " ; we must abandon
-the phrase is again his own—its
"crumbling idols"; we must break
once and for all with its traditions,
methods, usages. Now all this is
simply provincialism run mad —
fanatical provincialism, asserting
its own unreason and rejoicing in
it. Let the " great West " manifest
its spirit in literature, by all means;
let it find its own way ; let it
deal freshly with its magnificent
fresh material ; let it build its own
edifice, if necessary, in its own
chosen style of architecture. If it
succeeds, it will succeed because its
work is good, sound, valid —not be
cause it is wrought in an anti-feudal
spirit, or with any dogmatic inten
tion of "emancipating" itself from
anything or anybody. Hut we may
be sure of this —that such work will
not lie done the better or the more
effectively —that it will never be
helped, and may be seriously
marred, and even invalidated—by
being conceived in a boastful tem
per, and planned and carried
through in reckless ignorance of
what has succeeded and what
has failed in the past. When
Mr. Garland himself gives us his
stories of prairie life, we are in
terested, we are moved and stirred,
not because they are examples of
"emancipated" literature, but be
cause, after all, they have in them
some measure of the true life which
has secured pemanence and univer
sality —for all literature worth the
name, from the Book of Job
and the Homeric Epos down
to "The Man Who Was"and
" Madame Delphine." The first
and last aim of the artist
should be to endue his own work
with something of this true life. If
he fail to do so, of what service to
him or to us will be his Declaration
of Independence? If he succeed,
he need not trouble himself about
"emancipation," and rest assured
that we, his readers, will not trouble
ourselves about it in our turn.
What a relief it is, then, to turn
from the crude dogmatism of Mr.
Garland to the wise words of one
who knows literature as a scholar
and feels it as a poet. " Shakspere's
creations," writes Mr. Stedman,
"have been pronounced outworn"
—Shakspere being, of course, one of
the "crumbling idols" handed down
to us from a past which is not
"vital"—"have been pronounced
outworn, because he was the last
great 'poet of feudalism.' We
might as well say that the truth to
human life displayed in Genesis or
Exodus, or the synthetic beauty of
the Parthenon, or the glory (if the
Sistine Madonna, will grow inef
fective, forgetting that these have
the vitality which appertains to the
lasting nature of things. No poet
can ever outrival Shakspere"—can
ever take the place of that "crum
bling idol " —" except by a more ex
ceeding insight and utterance. It is
well said that great art is always
modern." And again, with what
pleasure do we acknowledge the
admirable common sense of some
remarks of another critical master
(who in such matters rarely fails to
hit the mark), concerning the so
called "Irish literary movement,"
which once again is only another
illustration of the outworkings of
the spirit of Provincialism. "J
confess," says Professor Dowden,
"that I am not ambitious of inten
sifying my intellectual or spiritual
brogue. . . . No folly can be
greater than that of fancying
that we shall strengthen our lit
erary position by living exclu
sively in our own ideas" —
that is, by "emancipating" our
selves —"and showing ourselves in
hospitable to the best ideas of other
lands" —and, we may add, of that
great past, which, the "emanci
pated" tell us, is no longer "vital."
And Professor Dowden adds one
most significant remark. "Every
great literary movement of modern
Kurope," be reminds us, "has been
born from the wedlock of two peo
ples." Should not this fact suggest
to us —to those of us, at all events,
who are not so thoroughly emanci
pated as to care nothing for the
teachings of history—that complete
emancipation might after all mean
— complete sterility ?
Hut if we need emancipation, it
is surely emancipation from such
clogging and paralyzing provincial
ism ; and this emancipation we
should help to accomplish in the
university classroom, and by uni
versity culture. Knowledge of the
best in literature that the world
has produced—the fineness of in
sight and the certainty of taste
which are developed by personal
contact with the vital and enduring
elements in the great books of past
and present: these things are what
we need always and everywhere—
and need more than ever today
and here in California—if we would
save ourselves from the perversion
of effort and the waste of power. A
man who has learned to appreciate

and feel what its vital and enduring
in the literature of Greece, England,
Italy, France, Germany —who has
been brought, let us say, under the
discipline of Sophocles, Shakspere,
Dante, Voltaire, Goethe —will have
been swept so far into the great
main current of culture, that he
will be in little danger of being
caught up in momentary eddies, or
washed into obscure backwater of
the stream. In such a school, we
learn to see things in their right
relations, estimate them by true
and permanent standards of value,
and put them into their proper
places.
And how sadly the power to do
this is needed just at present is
made manifest when we observe
the terrible lack of any sense of
proportion and perspective ex
hibited in newspaper reviews,
in magazine articles, in com
mon judgments about books and
authors hastily struck out in
conversation or more deliberately
registered in print. Look for a
moment at our whole modern
business of book-reviewing—note
its conspicuous short-comings—and
ask honestly what for the most part
it is really worth. I do not wish
to seem hard or querulous in my
censure; but in its more popular
forms, at any rate, is it for the most
part really worth anything at all ?
A reviewer, in virtue of his official
position, is supposed (and if this
be but a supposition, then so much
the worse for thefact) —is supposed
to guide and check public opinion
about things of which he is sup
posed (and again if this be but a
supposition, then so much the worse
for the fact), to know more than
the general reader ; it is, by the
hypothesis, his special function to
offer opinions which will help, di
rect, enlighten. Hut in the larger
proportion of cases, is this function
fultilled ? Does the magazine ar
ticle, does the newspaper criticism,
really guide or check, help, direct,
enlighten ? To put the question
in this downright fashion is surely
to answer it. And the worst aspect
of the matter is not, after all, that
article and criticism are so often
evidently the work of men who do
not in the least understand what
they are talking about. That is
bad enough, of course ; but the as
sertions of mere ignorance are, 1
take it, less subtly and less con
stantly dangerous than the distor
tion of critical vision commonly
exhibited even by men who take
their work seriously, write with
more than ordinary care, and show
a laudable desire to say something
to the point. A new novel is pub
lished —a book perhaps with many
admirable qualities and well de
serving a word of cordial recogni
tion. We turn to a notice of it in
a paper or magazine, and we find
the reviewer almost beside himself
in a frenzy of wonder and excite
ment. The work is hailed as a mas
terpiece, the author pronounced on
the spot a writer beside whom—if
we are to take his language at its
liberal meaning—Scott, Balzac,
Thackeray, are as prattling chil
dren. A year or two goes by ; the
great book and the great author
disappear from sight, or drop back
into the rank of the ephemerals;
and the critic, who seems never to
learn by experience, cheerfully and
unblushingiy breaks forth into an
other paeon over the arrival of an
other masterpiece, from the pen of
another genius ot the first, order.
What, we say in our confusion, is
it possible that there are really so
many Scotts, and Balzacs, and
Thackerays about ? Does the spread
of democracy mean that hereafter

geniuses are to l>e plenty as black
berries ? Or why all this fuss ?
And then we recall Browning's
legate who had lived to see —and
see out —four and twenty leaders of
revolt. But though there are moods
in which we may find passing
amusement in the situation, it is
but passing amusement, after all.
For if we are truly in earnest about
literature, all this laxity of critical
opinion must necessarily alarm us,
since we cannot blind ourselves
to the danger—the great and se
rious danger — inherent in our
wholesale abandonment of high
standards and the consequent vitia
tion of public tas-te. And where,
we ask, is any corrective to be
sought ? It must be sought in such
knowledge and insight as are given,
in such discipline and breadth of
view as are afforded, by the culture
of the university classroom. It is
not, indeed, to be argued that any
amount of university training will
of itself make a reviewer conscien
tious in the performance of his diffi
cult and sometimes delicate duty—
especially in these days when even
reputable publishers seek to bias
his mind and "inspire" his utter
ances. But such training will most
certainly give some sense of meas
ure, some feeling fur proportion,
some realization of what has and
what has not substantial claims
upon attention ; and in virtue of
these gains, a man's work as critic,
as leader of opinion, will neces
sarily become more temperate, more
intelligent, more helpful.
And to the culture and training
of the university classroom again,
we have mainly to look for a much
needed check upon yet another ten
dency of our time more widespread
and more generally pernicious than
any yet referred to. The evil of
which we now come to speak is not
local, or of sudden growth ; it per
vades almost the entire reading
world ; and it has developed grad
ually out of the changing social
conditions of the past fifty or sixty
years. I have in mind,as you will
have anticipated, the enormous re
cent growth of periodical litera
ture, and the intellectual results
which are now beginning to be rec
ognized as arising from our ever
increasing dependence upon it.
Ours is, we are often told, em
phatically a, reading age. 1 do not
deny this; indeed, if we consider
only the number of lines of print
per capita actually consumed by
our population, day by day, year
by year, no other age in history
has had such a claim to the dis
tincti >n. But it is, 1 am afraid, at
the same time an age of rapid read
ing, superficial reading, thoughtless
reading —of the kind of reading
which dissipates the energies, un
dermines the power of attention,
and plays havoc with the mind.
Coleridge long ago classed the con
stant perusal of periodicals among
anti-mnemonics, or destroyers of
memory, and looked with dread at
the growth of the magazine and
newspaper habit. If he was
alarmed, what should our feelings
be ? Step into a bookstore in the
early part of the month, and
turn over the magazines, just out,
and freshly exposed for sale, in all
the meretricious attractiveness of
elaborate covers, designed to arrest
the wandering eye. There they are
— ranged in picturesque rows —
pretentious, unpretentious—cheap,
dear —good, bad, indifferent; some
professing literary excellence—some
frankly abandoning all title to any
thing of the kind. Now, of course,
these publications vary in worth as
widely as they differ in their styles ;
and it would be unjust to lump

tliem together, and dismiss them all
with a single \rord of condemnation.
But what is the general impression
they leave upon us when we view
them in the lot ? It is not a pleas
ant impression,certainly. What a
mass of rubbish goes to the mak
ing of these monthly concoctions !
How poor —how unspeakably poor
—is, on the average, the stuff which
they set before their buyers ? How
little in any one of them are we
likely to find what will stand the
test of a second thoughtful reading !
Many of them are scarcely more
than picture-books—collections of
photogravures and the like, accom
panied by some weak explanatory
letter-press ; in most of them, again,
as is natural in an age which has
an unworthy passion for personal
ities, large space is given to portraits
of distinguished or notorious peo
ple, and to the catchpenny gossip
about them which, true or false, is
always held safe to amuse an idle
half-hour. Even, 1 grieve to say,
in our so-called literary magazines
—in periodicals directly devoted to
literature and its interests — the
same childish tendencies are to be
found encroaching on every side.
Here, too, we have not only ac
counts of new publications, and the
information we properly desire to
gain about current affairs in the
book world ; we have also pictures
of all the new rivals of Scott, Balzac,
and Thackeray—of their fathers,
mothers, uncles, and aunts —of
their places of birth and residence
— facsimiles from their manu
scripts, scraps from their letters,
and details innumerable about their
private lives and methods of work
—whether, for instance, they are
married or single, write the more
fluently before breakfast or at mid
night, prefer coffee or tea, golfing or
boating —with other such matter
of manifest importance in the
study of their books. All this is
positively painful. And if a little
serious consideration of our maga
zines fills ns with misapprehen
sion, what shall we say about
our newspapers ? —about our Sun
day newspapers particularly, which
themselves aspire to take rank as
magazines? What shall we say?
Perhaps it will be safest not to at
tempt to say anything. It would
be hard to do justice to such a
subject.
The bearings of our growing habit
of miscellaneous reading upon our
mental life and through this upon
real literature, have been admirably
described by a couple of writers,
whose words will carry so much
more weight than my own, that I
will ask you to listen to them in my
behalf.
Says Charles Dudley Warner : —
"The habit of excessive newspaper
reading, in which a great variety of
topics is inadequately treated, has
a curious effect on the mind. It
becomes demoralized, gradually
loses the power of concentration
or of continuous thought, and even
loses the inclination to read the
long articles which the newspaper
prints. The eye catches a thousand
things, but is detained by no
one. . . . The effect of this
scrappy desultory reading is bad
enough when the hashed compound
selected is tolerably good. It be
comes a very serious matter when
the reading itself is vapid, frivolous,
or bad. The responsibility of se
lecting the mental food for millions
of people is serious. When, in the
last century, in England, the So
ciety for the Diffusion of Useful In
formation, which accomplished so
much good, was organized, this re
sponsibility was felt, and competent
hands prepared the popular books
and pamphlets. . . . Now, it
happens that a hundred thousand
people, perhaps a million in some
cases, surrender the right of the all
important selection of food for their
minds to some unknown and irre
sponsible person whose business it
is to choose the miscellaneous read
ing-matter for a particular news-

paper. His or her taste may he
good, or it may he immature and
vicious ; it may he used simply to
create a sensation ; and yet the
million of readers get nothing ex
cept what this one person chooses
they shall read . . . Day after
day, Sunday after Sunday, they
read only what this unknown per
son selects for them. Instead of
going to the library and cultivating
their own tastes, and pursuing some
subject that will increase their
mental vigor and add to their per
manent stock of thought, they frit
ter away their time upon a hash of
literature chopped up for them by
a person possibly very unfit even
to make a good hash. The mere
statement of this surrender of one's
judgment of what shall be his in
tellectual life, is alarming."
1 have now indicated a few of
the directions in which the aca
demic study of literature should lie
made to count in the interests of
literature itself. It might perhaps
be expected that I should now say
something about the hearings of my
arguments upon our own classroom
work. Hut as any detailed discus
sion of methods would he here out
of place, I shall content myself, in
conclusion, with touching briefly
upon a couple of inferences the im
portance of which will, I trust, be
field to justify the emphasis I de
sire to throw upon them.
The broad view which I have
throughout taken of our university
responsibilities rests, of course, upon
an equally broad conception of the
literary training which it is one of
our chief objects to afford ; and
this in turn implies a distinction
between general literary culture on
the one hand, and what we techni
cally call scholarship on the other.
Here, then, in the University we
who deal witn literature have a
two-fold duty resting upon us — to
train the few as specialists, and to
help the many in the higher cul
ture of their lives ; and I maintain
that in our curriculum we should
keep these separate ends separately
in view. The future specialist
must rightly be asked to spend

j many laborious hours among minor
writers and relatively uninteresting
periods, in lines of minute investi
gation, in questions of detailed
| classification and analysis. But
meanwhile the general student
comes to us with but little energy
i available for a subject which for him
belongs now and will always be
long to the margin of his activities.
Well, under the circumstances

we cannot hope to make a scholar
of him ; we can at best give him
only a smattering of knowledge, an
imperfect conception of critical me
thods and results ; and while we
are doing this by putting him
through some part of the routine
adapted to the specialist, we are
wasting time which might be more
profitably spent in other ways,and,
it is more than probable, are culti
vating a false idea of literature and
a habit of mind which will present
ly be not helpful but injurious.
Professor Minto was right in as
serting that the study of English
literature could be made for all
students as severe a discipline as
the study of the classics; but he was
also right in adding that in the vast
majority of cases people are not
apt to find much subsequent satis
faction in the things which have
been used mainly as a training for
their minds. And in the vast ma
jority of cases, not mental discipline
purchased at the price of disen
chantment, but the development of
a large and living interest in litera
ture, is the mark at which we
should aim. How is it, I have
often been forced to ask myself,
that we often find such a fresh
spontaneous delight in literature
among men and women who have
never been through our university
courses ; while among so many who
havehad the advantage of our criti
cal drill and direction increased
knowledge has brought with it
apathy and indifference ? Mow is
it that while the student may know
so much more about a play of
Shakspere's, it is the outsider who
still, in a broad human way, feels
its passion and its power the more
intensely and thus gets really so
! much more out of it? We must
j admit that there is something rad
ically wrong somewhere when the
i academic study of literature is so
frequently equivalent to intellect
ual vaccination : one has a slight
attack, superinduced by artificial
means, and is thereby safeguarded
from any serious trouble of the
same kind in times to come. The
evil, I am bold to say, is largely

due to the wholesale sacrifice of
general culture to special scholar
ship ; and this, again, is in great
measure the outcome of the en
croachment upon literature of the
scientific spirit. We hear over
much novv-a-days of the need of
studying literature scientifically.
Now this notion of studying litera
ture scientifically means either
something which is neither very
new nor very remarkable, or some
thing against which it is our duty
to enter a vigorous protest. If it
means that in dealing with litera
ture and the history of literature,
we must he careful to know our
facts, see them steadily, set them in
their proper relationships, then no
one would complain : all this, I say,
is neither very new nor very re
markable. But if, on the other
hand, it means that the analytical
spirit and method of science — the
laboratory spirit and method — are
to he applied to the subject-matter
of literature, — if it means this, and
the consequent abandonment of the
true spirit and method of literature
itself —then surely the time has
come for those of us who believe in
literature as much as we believe in
science, to place ourselves at the
doors of our lecture-rooms, and
courageously bar the way. Litera
ture is not science, any more than
science is literature ; and the true
lines of approach to one and the
other subject differ as widely as the
aims and purposes of the subjects
themselves. Why, then, the scienti
fic study of literature, any more
than the literary study of science ?
As we demand the scientific study
of science, so we demand the liter
ary study of literature ; and the
literary study of literature means
something more than scholarship
— something more than the most
minute and accurate knowledge of
books, writers, dates, influences, the
evolution of forms and schools ; it
means the reaching of the brain

and soul of ail author and his work.
We may freely admit the practical
difficulty to which we are intro
duced when we conceive the matter
thus ;'for you may get twenty teach
ers of scientific method and scho
larship for one who himself feels
the inner spirit of literature and
has the power of bringing others to
feel it with him. But, all practi
cal difficulty notwithstanding, the
true ideals of literary culture
must still he setup in our lecture
rooms if our work there is to he
filled with the real life of thespirit,
and if we are to do our part in help
ing forward the higher civilization
of the great outer world.

Of all forms of mistake, (Jeorge
Eliot somewhere remarks, prophecy
is the most gratuitous. With such
a word of warning well in mind, I
would not wish to make this an oc
casion for indulging myself in any
rash predictions concerning what,
in the way of literature, the future
may or may not have in store. But
for those of us whose business it is
to pay some attention to the social
and intellectual conditions which,
at different times in the world's
history, have favored the free and
effective play of artistic genius, it
is only natural, 1 suppose, to turn
analysis occasionally from the
things of the past upon the circum
stances of our own time and place.
And if, as a result of such analysis,we
are led to speculate a litte curiously
on the possibility of fresh artistic
developments in years to come, we
may perhaps be allowed to do so
without protest, on the understand
ing that we are concerned only with
possibilities, and that we fully rec
ognize how frequently in such mat
ters the most carefully formed
hypotheses may he brought to
naught by the sudden irruption of
factors which have eluded scrutiny
or defied formulation.
Unless the signs of the times are
altogether misleading, therefore, I i
cannot but feel we have legiti
mate cause to believe that in the
not far distant future we may wit
ness, here on the Pacific Coast, the
beginnings of a literary movement
as distinct in character, as racy,
and in its kind as interesting and
valuable as that which, by the
middle of our century, had won
abiding glory for New England.
For here—as the most superficial
observation of the facts and condi-1
tions of California life should suf
fice to show us —the creative artist
of tomorrow — be he poet, novelist,
or dramatist- will find himself in
a new world of rare and splendid
opportunity. Think for a moment
of the stirring story of our still im
mediate past: —a story teeming with
records of adventure, of turbulence,
and violence, and conflict, of prim
itive passions, of bizarre achieve
ments and failures, of dramatic
crises, and the gradual building of
social order out of lawlessness and
confusion. There surely is a mass i
of moving incident and picturesque'
character as genuinely romantic
and as profoundly human as that
upon which the genius of Scott was
privileged to draw in the history
and legends of the Border. Nor
will the social field of today prove
a whit less fertile in theme and in
spiration. We have only to note
the striking vigor and diversity of
our western life—the cosmopolitan
ism which has resulted both from
the clash and from the blending of
races —the startling contrasts in
social types and ideals —the fresh
ness of the manhood and woman
hood fostered by our abounding
personal freedom and lack of con
ventional restraints ; -we have only
to note these things to realize that
we have here, indeed, ready to
hand, the raw material for nniny a
rich unwritten chapter in the peren

nial comedie kumaine. Moreover,
in reckoning up conditions, we must
not forget the stimulating qualities
of our mental atmosphere itself.
No one, born and bred in other en
vironments, can live for a few years
in California without remarking
upon the intellectual traits which
characterize the younger genera
tions here —upon their eagerness,
curiosity, expansiveness, generous
sympathies, quick perception, and
instructive response to art. An
artist depends largely upon his
public; and to live in so bracing
an intellectual climate must count
for not a little in his work. And
finally, in the fact that we are here
comparatively free from some of
the cramping influences of puritan-

ism, we may venture to emphasize
another element, which should con
duce somewhat — perhaps materi
ally —to the large and liberal ex
pression of artistic power.
Let it We understood that, in
speaking in this way, I am not ac
cepting, even in its most general
application, Taine's famous and
much-abused formula of the race,
the milieu, and the moment. No
such formula—no formula of any
kind—will explain genius, or ac
count satisfactorily for its manifes
tations ; nor will the closest study
of intellectual conditions and social
forces enable us to indicate before
hand what form any new literature
will take, or whether, indeed, there
will be any new literature worth
talking about. After all, when the
so-called scientific—which is more
often than not a merely pseudo
scientific— method of investigating
literary phenomena, has done its

utmost, it still remains true that,
no matter how favorable the condi
tions, how rich the soil, how keen
the intellectual atmosphere, where
no great poet happens to be born,
we shall have no great poetry;
where no great novelist or dramatist
appears, we shall have no great fic
tion or drama. The wind bloweth
where it listeth.and we must await
the rise of the Creator, the true
maker, and be content to recognize
in his coming what for us must re
main—l do not baulk the word—a
miracle, all our philosophic formu
las notwithstanding. All 1 insist
upon is, that given the literary
genius, the man of insight and cre
ative power, then existing condi
tions here should in many ways be

distinctly favorable to his growth
and free expression. Heine once
remarked that ;i man should he
very careful in the choice of his
parents. In likewise, a poet or
novelist should he very careful
about the place and time of his ap
pearance upon this planet. And a
poet or novelist might certainly do
worse than to get himself born .-it
the moment in California, where,as
I have argued, he will find ample
stimulus and opportunity to work
out whatever power may he in him.
It is natural, therefore, that we,
whose privilege it is to help to
mould in some degree the destinies
of the rising generations, should
look with interest at these various
indications of possible future lit
erary activity, and that such in
terest should be particularly keen
in the case of those of us whose own
work lies on the literary side of the
higher education. And with us, at

all events, this interest is bound to
partake of a practical character.
Noting the signs as we must, and
speculating as we may upon their
value and significance, we are also
led to ask ourselves what we may
personally do—what the University
as an organ and center of culture
may do—to aid and direct the
fores out of which the literary
movements of the future will take
their rise.
In venturing to offer some sug
gestions by way of answer to this
question, 1 may conveniently begin
by laying stress 011 the fact that the
literary influence of the University
and its curriculum will necessarily
be almost wholly critical and dis
ciplinary in its character, By this
I mean that we, within academic
walls, must not nourish the illusory
hope of helping to any extent to
develop the creative spirit, or to
furnish productive strength and
quickening power. Indeed, I will
go so far as to assert that the atti
tude toward literature which is so
sedulously cultivated in our class
rooms, and which it is the main
part of our purpose to cultivate, is,
and always must he, the reverse of
favorable to creative effort. Ob
serve, that I do not now refer to the
unfortunate results which follow
when literature is badly taught—
results which are indeed common
enough, because literature is often
badly taught, but which are none
the less due to abuses in method
and system, and, as such, are not
inevitable. That many young men
and women go out from our col
leges. as many boys and girls go
out from our schools, not only with
out the slightest real apprehension
of the spirit and meaning of the
great masterpieces to which they
have been introduced, but even with
a positive aversion to such master
pieces. is of course a fact to be
deeply deplored. Hut such must
continue to be the main upshot of
our classroom training wherever
the reading of a great piece of lit
erature is made primarily a drill in
linguistics, a course is textual crit
icism, an occasion for the pouring
in of all sorts of general knowledge
—so long, in a word, as the true
ends of literary culture are delib
erately or ignorantly sacrificed to
the ends of so-called—and often
miscalled — scholarship. But all
such evil consequences of the grind
ing of the academic mills—Which,
like the mills of God, grind slowly,
but exceeding small — belong, as J
have said, to the region of abuses
only, and, therefore, need not now
detain us. The point that I now
wish to make goes deeper, and takes
us down to the first principles of
all our academic study of letters.
For, as a matter not of choice, but
of necessity, practically our whole
effort in the classroom is expended
in the training and strengthening
of the critical faculties —our point
of view throughout is the purely
critical pointof view. This cannot,
so far as 1 see, be otherwise. Yet
what is the result ? Literature
conies unavoidably to be regarded
by teachers whose lives are given
up entirely to this point of view,
and therefore by the students who
are brought under their influence,
as a caput mortuum for analysis

and dissection. We go to work
with carefully elaborated methods,
and in the spirit of the disinter
ested scientific inquirer ; we probe,
arrange, classify, generalize, for
mulate ; we discuss environment,
cause and affect, action and reac
tion, influences, schools. Far be it
from me to say that all these things
have not their place and value ;
though it is hard enough sometimes,
in the conduct of our investigations,
to make sure that the finer spirit,
the essential life, the delicate aroma
of literature, do not escape us in
the process. But l.do insist that
all this minute and painstaking
analytic study can at best be of
little service when it comes to the
actual making of literature, and
may sometimes be therein a positive
obstacle. We are only dealing with
commonplaces when we assert that
in the history of literature the crit
ical spirit has been hostile to cre
ative power; and, though no one
would deny that there are many
individual instances in which crit
ical spirit and creative power have
been combined, still, in the average
of cases, the cultivation of the one
must be at the expense of theother.
And as, in our classroom work, our
temper is critical, our standpoint
critical, I conceive that 1 have fully
justified my perhaps rather startling
proposition that the issue of our
labors is, and must necessarily be,
the reverse of favorable to creative
effort.
But all this is, after all, only the
negative view of our academic du
ties, privileges, and responsibilities.
To reach the positive view we have
only to consider the complementary
aspect of our general statement.
For if we say that our work must
be in the main critical and disci
plinary in character, what do we
imply by such a declaration? We
imply, to begin with, that we may
do much to guide and regulate cre
ative genius ; to prevent it from
stultifying itself by errors of judg
ment and mistaken ideals ; to save
it from wasting effort in fruitless
experiments. It has been well said
that an ordinary music-master may
be of much service even to an em
bryo Mozart by pointing out to him
certain things that he must not do,
and so holding him on the high
road to true achievement. And we
imply, moreover, that while we
may do this for the creative artist
himself, we may also aid him and
his work greatly in indirect ways
by our uplifting and enlightening
influence upon the reading public
to which he will make his appeal.
In estimating the duty which the
university owes to society in the
matter of literary culture, I should
say then that it is a large part of
our business to train up, and pass
out into the world, year by year, a
body of good, intelligent, apprecia
tive, and judicious readers, capable
of discriminating between the real
and the meretricious in literature,
and thus of rating the books which
are put before them at something
like their real worth.
Here, then, we reach a point de
serving the strongest emphasis. The
knowledge of literature and of the
history of literature, the clear in
sight and the critical judgment,
which it is our aim, in the Univer
sity classroom, to give and foster,
should yield that culture which in
itself is full of saving grace. In
other words, our ambition must be
to cultivate within our students,
through sympathetic contact with
the greatest and best things in the
literature of the world, a permanent
and high standard of artistic values
—a standard to which all literature
whatsoever may be brought for test.

Because in literature there are no
tinal objective criteria to refer to, it
is sometimes idly supposed that we
can have no stable or trustworthy
criteria at all : —it is all subjective,
we are told ; artistic excellence is
this to me and that to t.hee, and
there the matter must rest. Hut
in fact there is no more reason for
deciding questions of art upon the
opinion of the man in the street,
than there is for allowing him the
last word on questions of astronomy
or biology. Anolate France, vig
orously insisting that all literary
judgments must be merely personal,
once roundly declared that a critic,
to be honest, should say—not,
Gentlemen, I am to speak to you
about Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere ; but, Gentlemen, I am to
speak to you about myself in rela
tion to Racine, or Pascal, or Shaks
pere. Within certain limits, 1
conceive this to be perfectly true.
But is there no distinction to be
made between the verdict of the
literary scholar, when he speaks of
himself in relation to Racine, Pas
cal, Shakspere, and that, let us say,
of the half-educated journalist man
ufacturing an article to order upon
himself in relation to the thinker or
the playwright ? Formal answer
to such a question is surely un
necessary. Though we may admit
the impossibility of establishing
exact objective touchstones, which
will be in the hands of the specialist,
but of which the ordinary individ
ual will know little or nothing—
though we must thus reject any
attempt to put our judgments on
the firm foundations of a science,
we are not, therefore, to regard crit
icism as reduced to anarchy —to a
chaos of feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. We insist upon the
fundamental differences in value
among feelings, impressions, per
sonal opinions. Jf the scientist re
fuses to take the conclusions of the
first man he meets concerning the
evidence for or against the trans
mission of acquired characters, we
just as emphatically refuse to take
the conclusions of the first man we
meet about the relative importance
of the novels of Jane Austen and
Archibald C. Gunter, or the worth
and significance of the writings of
Charles Lamb or Walter Pater.
No more in literature than in science
are we prepared to accept manhood
suffrage, and settle things by plebis
cite. Only those who know liter
ature in a large and generous way,
who have been in personal com
munion with the great writers of the
past and present, who have consid
ered, analyzed, compared, whose
perception has thus been trained,
whose judgment has thus been
matured —only such are really en
titled to a hearing in matters where
issues of artistic valuation are in
volved. Well, it is part of our duty
in the university to leaven the
reading mass of the public—the vo
racious, untrained, uncritical public
—with the leaven of the higher
culture, and so to send out into
society —not only through teachers
and journalists, but also in the
various walks of private life —lines
of influence which shall help to
raise the general taste, and thus
count positively for good.
Noting all this in a broad way,
we will now try to indicate one or
two special directions in which, as
regards both writers and their read
ers, such culture should be made to
tell.
One considerable danger by which
we who live in California are con
tinually threatened is the danger
which arises from our isolation. In
what ways this isolation affects for
ill the general life of the State, this

is not the place to inquire. Our
concern is simply with its bearings
upon literature ; and in literature,
its evil tendencies are sufficiently
marked. These may be summed
up in the one word —Provincial-
ism,—provincialism, with its ac
companying narrowness of aim and
purpose, of understanding and sym
pathy. Insularity, the French crit
ics are fond of insisting, is always
the prison of art ; and provin
cialism, it would be well for
us to remember, is only another
name for insularity. One would
have supposed that, at this time
of day, people would begin to
realize that the intellectual wel
fare and progress of any com
munity are best guaranteed and
subserved by broad, direct, and
constant contact with the thought
and feeling of the great outer world.
Yet so far is this from being our
case, that here provincialism is de
liberately fostered by the newspa
pers, and by a number of well
meaning but short-sighted theorists
who seem to regard aloofness, self
involution, and intellectual clan
nishness as the one certain means
of insuring individual independ
ence and free personal growth. In
this way we are asked to resuscitate
the exploded ideals of the days of
the Barlows and the Dwights, when,
as a protest against hated British
tyranny, the American writer
sought to break loose altogether
from British literary tradition in
style, method, even orthography ;
we are asked to repeat the demand
of Mr. Hathaway, in " Kaavnagh,"
for a "national literature" which
shall be "altogether shaggy and
unshorn " ; we are asked to adopt
the worst errors of Walt Whitman,
who, in order to show his dem
ocratic vigor and Americanism,
made wild critical assaults upon
Shakspere and Tennyson, and, with
a loud " go to !" set himself to man
ufacture, out of hand, a new litera
ture, fresh in principle,and without
indebtedness to the past. It is ade
quate literary culture that must save
us from such follies in the future,
as it was adequate literary culture —
in the person of Oliver Wendell
Holmes and a few other influential
men of the time —that saved Ainer
tcan literature from them half a
century ago. " I remember," says
Holmes' biographer, Mr. John T.
Morse, " I remember once hearing
a gentleman of some reputation in
literature say —actually in address
ing the Board of Overseers of a dis
tinguished seat of learning—that
he did not approve of teaching
young men to write 'good English,'
to use words accurately, and to
construct sentences gramatically ;
on the contrary, he said that he
wanted an infusion of the wild,
rough inaccuracies of the great new
West! He was," Mr. Morse con
tinues, " the victim of a foolish
notion, that one of the available
ways to show 'American independ
ence of England,' was by devising
a degraded dialect of the English
language for use in the United
States Nor was he alone in this
feeling . . . ; there was for a
while a wild pseudo-literary fad in
this direction. Dr. Holmes looked
upon it with disgust and indigna
tion, making his opinions known
with his usual outspoken courage,
and exemplifying them by his own
action, with the result that he was
for a while subjected to some abuse."
If today we all recognize the bene
ficial influence of Holmes' con
servatism, we should equally recog
nize the important part which such
conservatism —the conservatism of
culture —has still to play, particu
larly in our own western world.

I would not have it supposed that
I overlook the meaning and value
of provincialism, or fail to appre
ciate what is vital and significant,
for example, beneath the strain,
the conscious posturings, the affecta
tions and perversities of Whitman's
work. Literary history shows
clearly enough that, during periods
which tend to formalism and con
vention, provincialism has often
done splendid work by bringing
new material and new blood into
art. The provincial movement is,
for exam[de, to be reckoned one of
the potent generative forces in the
romantic developments of the latter
half of the eighteenth century. Hut
literary history also shows with
equal clearness how futile and un
profitable provincialism always be
comes when it rests mainly on its
sense of newness and isolation —
when it refuses to relate itseif in
direct and healthy contact with
the best things in the world outside
and the transmitted culture of by
gone ages. Many a man of real
genius and promise has fallen short
of effective utterance by wandering
off after some spectral ambition of
originality ; many a fresh move
ment has come to naught because
it has cut itself loose from culture,
and has sought its purpose and its
field in narrow aims and parochial
interests. One of our younger gen
eration of writers has constituted
himself the spokesman and evan
gelist of what lie calls the libera
tion of the "great West." Accord
ing to him, the first important
thing for the "great West" to do
in literature is—to get itself "eman
cipated." Incidentally we might
suggest that the first important
thing for the "great West," or for
any other part of the world, to do
in literature, is to write great books ;
and that it is extremely doubtful
whether any really valuable output
of literature was ever yet heralded
or helped by clamorous and hys
terical demands for emancipation.
Hut these are points which we may
at present leave undiscussed. Con
cerning what Mr. Hamlin Garland
means by emancipation, however,
we need not remain in doubt. The
day of the East —the day of foreign
influence, according to him —is over,
or should be over. In this fact
lies our hope of "emancipation."
The past —the phrase is bis own
"is not vital " ; we must abandon
-the phrase is again his own—its
"crumbling idols"; we must break
once and for all with its traditions,
methods, usages. Now all this is
simply provincialism run mad —
fanatical provincialism, asserting
its own unreason and rejoicing in
it. Let the " great West " manifest
its spirit in literature, by all means;
let it find its own way ; let it
deal freshly with its magnificent
fresh material ; let it build its own
edifice, if necessary, in its own
chosen style of architecture. If it
succeeds, it will succeed because its
work is good, sound, valid —not be
cause it is wrought in an anti-feudal
spirit, or with any dogmatic inten
tion of "emancipating" itself from
anything or anybody. Hut we may
be sure of this —that such work will
not lie done the better or the more
effectively —that it will never be
helped, and may be seriously
marred, and even invalidated—by
being conceived in a boastful tem
per, and planned and carried
through in reckless ignorance of
what has succeeded and what
has failed in the past. When
Mr. Garland himself gives us his
stories of prairie life, we are in
terested, we are moved and stirred,
not because they are examples of
"emancipated" literature, but be
cause, after all, they have in them
some measure of the true life which
has secured pemanence and univer
sality —for all literature worth the
name, from the Book of Job
and the Homeric Epos down
to "The Man Who Was"and
" Madame Delphine." The first
and last aim of the artist
should be to endue his own work
with something of this true life. If
he fail to do so, of what service to
him or to us will be his Declaration
of Independence? If he succeed,
he need not trouble himself about
"emancipation," and rest assured
that we, his readers, will not trouble
ourselves about it in our turn.
What a relief it is, then, to turn
from the crude dogmatism of Mr.
Garland to the wise words of one
who knows literature as a scholar
and feels it as a poet. " Shakspere's
creations," writes Mr. Stedman,
"have been pronounced outworn"
—Shakspere being, of course, one of
the "crumbling idols" handed down
to us from a past which is not
"vital"—"have been pronounced
outworn, because he was the last
great 'poet of feudalism.' We
might as well say that the truth to
human life displayed in Genesis or
Exodus, or the synthetic beauty of
the Parthenon, or the glory (if the
Sistine Madonna, will grow inef
fective, forgetting that these have
the vitality which appertains to the
lasting nature of things. No poet
can ever outrival Shakspere"—can
ever take the place of that "crum
bling idol " —" except by a more ex
ceeding insight and utterance. It is
well said that great art is always
modern." And again, with what
pleasure do we acknowledge the
admirable common sense of some
remarks of another critical master
(who in such matters rarely fails to
hit the mark), concerning the so
called "Irish literary movement,"
which once again is only another
illustration of the outworkings of
the spirit of Provincialism. "J
confess," says Professor Dowden,
"that I am not ambitious of inten
sifying my intellectual or spiritual
brogue. . . . No folly can be
greater than that of fancying
that we shall strengthen our lit
erary position by living exclu
sively in our own ideas" —
that is, by "emancipating" our
selves —"and showing ourselves in
hospitable to the best ideas of other
lands" —and, we may add, of that
great past, which, the "emanci
pated" tell us, is no longer "vital."
And Professor Dowden adds one
most significant remark. "Every
great literary movement of modern
Kurope," be reminds us, "has been
born from the wedlock of two peo
ples." Should not this fact suggest
to us —to those of us, at all events,
who are not so thoroughly emanci
pated as to care nothing for the
teachings of history—that complete
emancipation might after all mean
— complete sterility ?
Hut if we need emancipation, it
is surely emancipation from such
clogging and paralyzing provincial
ism ; and this emancipation we
should help to accomplish in the
university classroom, and by uni
versity culture. Knowledge of the
best in literature that the world
has produced—the fineness of in
sight and the certainty of taste
which are developed by personal
contact with the vital and enduring
elements in the great books of past
and present: these things are what
we need always and everywhere—
and need more than ever today
and here in California—if we would
save ourselves from the perversion
of effort and the waste of power. A
man who has learned to appreciate

and feel what its vital and enduring
in the literature of Greece, England,
Italy, France, Germany —who has
been brought, let us say, under the
discipline of Sophocles, Shakspere,
Dante, Voltaire, Goethe —will have
been swept so far into the great
main current of culture, that he
will be in little danger of being
caught up in momentary eddies, or
washed into obscure backwater of
the stream. In such a school, we
learn to see things in their right
relations, estimate them by true
and permanent standards of value,
and put them into their proper
places.
And how sadly the power to do
this is needed just at present is
made manifest when we observe
the terrible lack of any sense of
proportion and perspective ex
hibited in newspaper reviews,
in magazine articles, in com
mon judgments about books and
authors hastily struck out in
conversation or more deliberately
registered in print. Look for a
moment at our whole modern
business of book-reviewing—note
its conspicuous short-comings—and
ask honestly what for the most part
it is really worth. I do not wish
to seem hard or querulous in my
censure; but in its more popular
forms, at any rate, is it for the most
part really worth anything at all ?
A reviewer, in virtue of his official
position, is supposed (and if this
be but a supposition, then so much
the worse for thefact) —is supposed
to guide and check public opinion
about things of which he is sup
posed (and again if this be but a
supposition, then so much the worse
for the fact), to know more than
the general reader ; it is, by the
hypothesis, his special function to
offer opinions which will help, di
rect, enlighten. Hut in the larger
proportion of cases, is this function
fultilled ? Does the magazine ar
ticle, does the newspaper criticism,
really guide or check, help, direct,
enlighten ? To put the question
in this downright fashion is surely
to answer it. And the worst aspect
of the matter is not, after all, that
article and criticism are so often
evidently the work of men who do
not in the least understand what
they are talking about. That is
bad enough, of course ; but the as
sertions of mere ignorance are, 1
take it, less subtly and less con
stantly dangerous than the distor
tion of critical vision commonly
exhibited even by men who take
their work seriously, write with
more than ordinary care, and show
a laudable desire to say something
to the point. A new novel is pub
lished —a book perhaps with many
admirable qualities and well de
serving a word of cordial recogni
tion. We turn to a notice of it in
a paper or magazine, and we find
the reviewer almost beside himself
in a frenzy of wonder and excite
ment. The work is hailed as a mas
terpiece, the author pronounced on
the spot a writer beside whom—if
we are to take his language at its
liberal meaning—Scott, Balzac,
Thackeray, are as prattling chil
dren. A year or two goes by ; the
great book and the great author
disappear from sight, or drop back
into the rank of the ephemerals;
and the critic, who seems never to
learn by experience, cheerfully and
unblushingiy breaks forth into an
other paeon over the arrival of an
other masterpiece, from the pen of
another genius ot the first, order.
What, we say in our confusion, is
it possible that there are really so
many Scotts, and Balzacs, and
Thackerays about ? Does the spread
of democracy mean that hereafter

geniuses are to l>e plenty as black
berries ? Or why all this fuss ?
And then we recall Browning's
legate who had lived to see —and
see out —four and twenty leaders of
revolt. But though there are moods
in which we may find passing
amusement in the situation, it is
but passing amusement, after all.
For if we are truly in earnest about
literature, all this laxity of critical
opinion must necessarily alarm us,
since we cannot blind ourselves
to the danger—the great and se
rious danger — inherent in our
wholesale abandonment of high
standards and the consequent vitia
tion of public tas-te. And where,
we ask, is any corrective to be
sought ? It must be sought in such
knowledge and insight as are given,
in such discipline and breadth of
view as are afforded, by the culture
of the university classroom. It is
not, indeed, to be argued that any
amount of university training will
of itself make a reviewer conscien
tious in the performance of his diffi
cult and sometimes delicate duty—
especially in these days when even
reputable publishers seek to bias
his mind and "inspire" his utter
ances. But such training will most
certainly give some sense of meas
ure, some feeling fur proportion,
some realization of what has and
what has not substantial claims
upon attention ; and in virtue of
these gains, a man's work as critic,
as leader of opinion, will neces
sarily become more temperate, more
intelligent, more helpful.
And to the culture and training
of the university classroom again,
we have mainly to look for a much
needed check upon yet another ten
dency of our time more widespread
and more generally pernicious than
any yet referred to. The evil of
which we now come to speak is not
local, or of sudden growth ; it per
vades almost the entire reading
world ; and it has developed grad
ually out of the changing social
conditions of the past fifty or sixty
years. I have in mind,as you will
have anticipated, the enormous re
cent growth of periodical litera
ture, and the intellectual results
which are now beginning to be rec
ognized as arising from our ever
increasing dependence upon it.
Ours is, we are often told, em
phatically a, reading age. 1 do not
deny this; indeed, if we consider
only the number of lines of print
per capita actually consumed by
our population, day by day, year
by year, no other age in history
has had such a claim to the dis
tincti >n. But it is, 1 am afraid, at
the same time an age of rapid read
ing, superficial reading, thoughtless
reading —of the kind of reading
which dissipates the energies, un
dermines the power of attention,
and plays havoc with the mind.
Coleridge long ago classed the con
stant perusal of periodicals among
anti-mnemonics, or destroyers of
memory, and looked with dread at
the growth of the magazine and
newspaper habit. If he was
alarmed, what should our feelings
be ? Step into a bookstore in the
early part of the month, and
turn over the magazines, just out,
and freshly exposed for sale, in all
the meretricious attractiveness of
elaborate covers, designed to arrest
the wandering eye. There they are
— ranged in picturesque rows —
pretentious, unpretentious—cheap,
dear —good, bad, indifferent; some
professing literary excellence—some
frankly abandoning all title to any
thing of the kind. Now, of course,
these publications vary in worth as
widely as they differ in their styles ;
and it would be unjust to lump

tliem together, and dismiss them all
with a single \rord of condemnation.
But what is the general impression
they leave upon us when we view
them in the lot ? It is not a pleas
ant impression,certainly. What a
mass of rubbish goes to the mak
ing of these monthly concoctions !
How poor —how unspeakably poor
—is, on the average, the stuff which
they set before their buyers ? How
little in any one of them are we
likely to find what will stand the
test of a second thoughtful reading !
Many of them are scarcely more
than picture-books—collections of
photogravures and the like, accom
panied by some weak explanatory
letter-press ; in most of them, again,
as is natural in an age which has
an unworthy passion for personal
ities, large space is given to portraits
of distinguished or notorious peo
ple, and to the catchpenny gossip
about them which, true or false, is
always held safe to amuse an idle
half-hour. Even, 1 grieve to say,
in our so-called literary magazines
—in periodicals directly devoted to
literature and its interests — the
same childish tendencies are to be
found encroaching on every side.
Here, too, we have not only ac
counts of new publications, and the
information we properly desire to
gain about current affairs in the
book world ; we have also pictures
of all the new rivals of Scott, Balzac,
and Thackeray—of their fathers,
mothers, uncles, and aunts —of
their places of birth and residence
— facsimiles from their manu
scripts, scraps from their letters,
and details innumerable about their
private lives and methods of work
—whether, for instance, they are
married or single, write the more
fluently before breakfast or at mid
night, prefer coffee or tea, golfing or
boating —with other such matter
of manifest importance in the
study of their books. All this is
positively painful. And if a little
serious consideration of our maga
zines fills ns with misapprehen
sion, what shall we say about
our newspapers ? —about our Sun
day newspapers particularly, which
themselves aspire to take rank as
magazines? What shall we say?
Perhaps it will be safest not to at
tempt to say anything. It would
be hard to do justice to such a
subject.
The bearings of our growing habit
of miscellaneous reading upon our
mental life and through this upon
real literature, have been admirably
described by a couple of writers,
whose words will carry so much
more weight than my own, that I
will ask you to listen to them in my
behalf.
Says Charles Dudley Warner : —
"The habit of excessive newspaper
reading, in which a great variety of
topics is inadequately treated, has
a curious effect on the mind. It
becomes demoralized, gradually
loses the power of concentration
or of continuous thought, and even
loses the inclination to read the
long articles which the newspaper
prints. The eye catches a thousand
things, but is detained by no
one. . . . The effect of this
scrappy desultory reading is bad
enough when the hashed compound
selected is tolerably good. It be
comes a very serious matter when
the reading itself is vapid, frivolous,
or bad. The responsibility of se
lecting the mental food for millions
of people is serious. When, in the
last century, in England, the So
ciety for the Diffusion of Useful In
formation, which accomplished so
much good, was organized, this re
sponsibility was felt, and competent
hands prepared the popular books
and pamphlets. . . . Now, it
happens that a hundred thousand
people, perhaps a million in some
cases, surrender the right of the all
important selection of food for their
minds to some unknown and irre
sponsible person whose business it
is to choose the miscellaneous read
ing-matter for a particular news-

paper. His or her taste may he
good, or it may he immature and
vicious ; it may he used simply to
create a sensation ; and yet the
million of readers get nothing ex
cept what this one person chooses
they shall read . . . Day after
day, Sunday after Sunday, they
read only what this unknown per
son selects for them. Instead of
going to the library and cultivating
their own tastes, and pursuing some
subject that will increase their
mental vigor and add to their per
manent stock of thought, they frit
ter away their time upon a hash of
literature chopped up for them by
a person possibly very unfit even
to make a good hash. The mere
statement of this surrender of one's
judgment of what shall be his in
tellectual life, is alarming."
1 have now indicated a few of
the directions in which the aca
demic study of literature should lie
made to count in the interests of
literature itself. It might perhaps
be expected that I should now say
something about the hearings of my
arguments upon our own classroom
work. Hut as any detailed discus
sion of methods would he here out
of place, I shall content myself, in
conclusion, with touching briefly
upon a couple of inferences the im
portance of which will, I trust, be
field to justify the emphasis I de
sire to throw upon them.
The broad view which I have
throughout taken of our university
responsibilities rests, of course, upon
an equally broad conception of the
literary training which it is one of
our chief objects to afford ; and
this in turn implies a distinction
between general literary culture on
the one hand, and what we techni
cally call scholarship on the other.
Here, then, in the University we
who deal witn literature have a
two-fold duty resting upon us — to
train the few as specialists, and to
help the many in the higher cul
ture of their lives ; and I maintain
that in our curriculum we should
keep these separate ends separately
in view. The future specialist
must rightly be asked to spend

j many laborious hours among minor
writers and relatively uninteresting
periods, in lines of minute investi
gation, in questions of detailed
| classification and analysis. But
meanwhile the general student
comes to us with but little energy
i available for a subject which for him
belongs now and will always be
long to the margin of his activities.
Well, under the circumstances

we cannot hope to make a scholar
of him ; we can at best give him
only a smattering of knowledge, an
imperfect conception of critical me
thods and results ; and while we
are doing this by putting him
through some part of the routine
adapted to the specialist, we are
wasting time which might be more
profitably spent in other ways,and,
it is more than probable, are culti
vating a false idea of literature and
a habit of mind which will present
ly be not helpful but injurious.
Professor Minto was right in as
serting that the study of English
literature could be made for all
students as severe a discipline as
the study of the classics; but he was
also right in adding that in the vast
majority of cases people are not
apt to find much subsequent satis
faction in the things which have
been used mainly as a training for
their minds. And in the vast ma
jority of cases, not mental discipline
purchased at the price of disen
chantment, but the development of
a large and living interest in litera
ture, is the mark at which we
should aim. How is it, I have
often been forced to ask myself,
that we often find such a fresh
spontaneous delight in literature
among men and women who have
never been through our university
courses ; while among so many who
havehad the advantage of our criti
cal drill and direction increased
knowledge has brought with it
apathy and indifference ? Mow is
it that while the student may know
so much more about a play of
Shakspere's, it is the outsider who
still, in a broad human way, feels
its passion and its power the more
intensely and thus gets really so
! much more out of it? We must
j admit that there is something rad
ically wrong somewhere when the
i academic study of literature is so
frequently equivalent to intellect
ual vaccination : one has a slight
attack, superinduced by artificial
means, and is thereby safeguarded
from any serious trouble of the
same kind in times to come. The
evil, I am bold to say, is largely

due to the wholesale sacrifice of
general culture to special scholar
ship ; and this, again, is in great
measure the outcome of the en
croachment upon literature of the
scientific spirit. We hear over
much novv-a-days of the need of
studying literature scientifically.
Now this notion of studying litera
ture scientifically means either
something which is neither very
new nor very remarkable, or some
thing against which it is our duty
to enter a vigorous protest. If it
means that in dealing with litera
ture and the history of literature,
we must he careful to know our
facts, see them steadily, set them in
their proper relationships, then no
one would complain : all this, I say,
is neither very new nor very re
markable. But if, on the other
hand, it means that the analytical
spirit and method of science — the
laboratory spirit and method — are
to he applied to the subject-matter
of literature, — if it means this, and
the consequent abandonment of the
true spirit and method of literature
itself —then surely the time has
come for those of us who believe in
literature as much as we believe in
science, to place ourselves at the
doors of our lecture-rooms, and
courageously bar the way. Litera
ture is not science, any more than
science is literature ; and the true
lines of approach to one and the
other subject differ as widely as the
aims and purposes of the subjects
themselves. Why, then, the scienti
fic study of literature, any more
than the literary study of science ?
As we demand the scientific study
of science, so we demand the liter
ary study of literature ; and the
literary study of literature means
something more than scholarship
— something more than the most
minute and accurate knowledge of
books, writers, dates, influences, the
evolution of forms and schools ; it
means the reaching of the brain

and soul of ail author and his work.
We may freely admit the practical
difficulty to which we are intro
duced when we conceive the matter
thus ;'for you may get twenty teach
ers of scientific method and scho
larship for one who himself feels
the inner spirit of literature and
has the power of bringing others to
feel it with him. But, all practi
cal difficulty notwithstanding, the
true ideals of literary culture
must still he setup in our lecture
rooms if our work there is to he
filled with the real life of thespirit,
and if we are to do our part in help
ing forward the higher civilization
of the great outer world.
