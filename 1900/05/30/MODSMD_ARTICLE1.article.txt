# COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS
## Professor Hudson's Speech Before the Graduating Class of 1900. 
### 
Of all forms of mistake, (Jeorge
Eliot somewhere remarks, prophecy
is the most gratuitous. With such
a word of warning well in mind, I
would not wish to make this an oc
casion for indulging myself in any
rash predictions concerning what,
in the way of literature, the future
may or may not have in store. But
for those of us whose business it is
to pay some attention to the social
and intellectual conditions which,
at different times in the world's
history, have favored the free and
effective play of artistic genius, it
is only natural, 1 suppose, to turn
analysis occasionally from the
things of the past upon the circum
stances of our own time and place.
And if, as a result of such analysis,we
are led to speculate a litte curiously
on the possibility of fresh artistic
developments in years to come, we
may perhaps be allowed to do so
without protest, on the understand
ing that we are concerned only with
possibilities, and that we fully rec
ognize how frequently in such mat
ters the most carefully formed
hypotheses may he brought to
naught by the sudden irruption of
factors which have eluded scrutiny
or defied formulation.
Unless the signs of the times are
altogether misleading, therefore, I i
cannot but feel we have legiti
mate cause to believe that in the
not far distant future we may wit
ness, here on the Pacific Coast, the
beginnings of a literary movement
as distinct in character, as racy,
and in its kind as interesting and
valuable as that which, by the
middle of our century, had won
abiding glory for New England.
For here—as the most superficial
observation of the facts and condi-1
tions of California life should suf
fice to show us —the creative artist
of tomorrow — be he poet, novelist,
or dramatist- will find himself in
a new world of rare and splendid
opportunity. Think for a moment
of the stirring story of our still im
mediate past: —a story teeming with
records of adventure, of turbulence,
and violence, and conflict, of prim
itive passions, of bizarre achieve
ments and failures, of dramatic
crises, and the gradual building of
social order out of lawlessness and
confusion. There surely is a mass i
of moving incident and picturesque'
character as genuinely romantic
and as profoundly human as that
upon which the genius of Scott was
privileged to draw in the history
and legends of the Border. Nor
will the social field of today prove
a whit less fertile in theme and in
spiration. We have only to note
the striking vigor and diversity of
our western life—the cosmopolitan
ism which has resulted both from
the clash and from the blending of
races —the startling contrasts in
social types and ideals —the fresh
ness of the manhood and woman
hood fostered by our abounding
personal freedom and lack of con
ventional restraints ; -we have only
to note these things to realize that
we have here, indeed, ready to
hand, the raw material for nniny a
rich unwritten chapter in the peren

nial comedie kumaine. Moreover,
in reckoning up conditions, we must
not forget the stimulating qualities
of our mental atmosphere itself.
No one, born and bred in other en
vironments, can live for a few years
in California without remarking
upon the intellectual traits which
characterize the younger genera
tions here —upon their eagerness,
curiosity, expansiveness, generous
sympathies, quick perception, and
instructive response to art. An
artist depends largely upon his
public; and to live in so bracing
an intellectual climate must count
for not a little in his work. And
finally, in the fact that we are here
comparatively free from some of
the cramping influences of puritan-

ism, we may venture to emphasize
another element, which should con
duce somewhat — perhaps materi
ally —to the large and liberal ex
pression of artistic power.
Let it We understood that, in
speaking in this way, I am not ac
cepting, even in its most general
application, Taine's famous and
much-abused formula of the race,
the milieu, and the moment. No
such formula—no formula of any
kind—will explain genius, or ac
count satisfactorily for its manifes
tations ; nor will the closest study
of intellectual conditions and social
forces enable us to indicate before
hand what form any new literature
will take, or whether, indeed, there
will be any new literature worth
talking about. After all, when the
so-called scientific—which is more
often than not a merely pseudo
scientific— method of investigating
literary phenomena, has done its

utmost, it still remains true that,
no matter how favorable the condi
tions, how rich the soil, how keen
the intellectual atmosphere, where
no great poet happens to be born,
we shall have no great poetry;
where no great novelist or dramatist
appears, we shall have no great fic
tion or drama. The wind bloweth
where it listeth.and we must await
the rise of the Creator, the true
maker, and be content to recognize
in his coming what for us must re
main—l do not baulk the word—a
miracle, all our philosophic formu
las notwithstanding. All 1 insist
upon is, that given the literary
genius, the man of insight and cre
ative power, then existing condi
tions here should in many ways be

distinctly favorable to his growth
and free expression. Heine once
remarked that ;i man should he
very careful in the choice of his
parents. In likewise, a poet or
novelist should he very careful
about the place and time of his ap
pearance upon this planet. And a
poet or novelist might certainly do
worse than to get himself born .-it
the moment in California, where,as
I have argued, he will find ample
stimulus and opportunity to work
out whatever power may he in him.
It is natural, therefore, that we,
whose privilege it is to help to
mould in some degree the destinies
of the rising generations, should
look with interest at these various
indications of possible future lit
erary activity, and that such in
terest should be particularly keen
in the case of those of us whose own
work lies on the literary side of the
higher education. And with us, at

all events, this interest is bound to
partake of a practical character.
Noting the signs as we must, and
speculating as we may upon their
value and significance, we are also
led to ask ourselves what we may
personally do—what the University
as an organ and center of culture
may do—to aid and direct the
fores out of which the literary
movements of the future will take
their rise.
In venturing to offer some sug
gestions by way of answer to this
question, 1 may conveniently begin
by laying stress 011 the fact that the
literary influence of the University
and its curriculum will necessarily
be almost wholly critical and dis
ciplinary in its character, By this
I mean that we, within academic
walls, must not nourish the illusory
hope of helping to any extent to
develop the creative spirit, or to
furnish productive strength and
quickening power. Indeed, I will
go so far as to assert that the atti
tude toward literature which is so
sedulously cultivated in our class
rooms, and which it is the main
part of our purpose to cultivate, is,
and always must he, the reverse of
favorable to creative effort. Ob
serve, that I do not now refer to the
unfortunate results which follow
when literature is badly taught—
results which are indeed common
enough, because literature is often
badly taught, but which are none
the less due to abuses in method
and system, and, as such, are not
inevitable. That many young men
and women go out from our col
leges. as many boys and girls go
out from our schools, not only with
out the slightest real apprehension
of the spirit and meaning of the
great masterpieces to which they
have been introduced, but even with
a positive aversion to such master
pieces. is of course a fact to be
deeply deplored. Hut such must
continue to be the main upshot of
our classroom training wherever
the reading of a great piece of lit
erature is made primarily a drill in
linguistics, a course is textual crit
icism, an occasion for the pouring
in of all sorts of general knowledge
—so long, in a word, as the true
ends of literary culture are delib
erately or ignorantly sacrificed to
the ends of so-called—and often
miscalled — scholarship. But all
such evil consequences of the grind
ing of the academic mills—Which,
like the mills of God, grind slowly,
but exceeding small — belong, as J
have said, to the region of abuses
only, and, therefore, need not now
detain us. The point that I now
wish to make goes deeper, and takes
us down to the first principles of
all our academic study of letters.
For, as a matter not of choice, but
of necessity, practically our whole
effort in the classroom is expended
in the training and strengthening
of the critical faculties —our point
of view throughout is the purely
critical pointof view. This cannot,
so far as 1 see, be otherwise. Yet
what is the result ? Literature
conies unavoidably to be regarded
by teachers whose lives are given
up entirely to this point of view,
and therefore by the students who
are brought under their influence,
as a caput mortuum for analysis
