# Senior Ball.

### 
By far the prettiest dance of the
year, and one that did not fall be
hind any ever given at Stanford,
was the Senior Hall in Encina Club
room Monday evening. Every
thing showed the taste and hard
work of those who had the affair in
charge. Especially noticeable was
the light effect, the incandescent
globes being covered with delicate
tissue which softened the glow that
is often annoying.
Yankt's orchestra of eight pieces,
hidden in a bower of green, was at
its very best, frequently receiving
three and four encores. There were
about sixty couples present, just
enough to comfortably fill the floor.
The great number of alumni and
former students present was espe
cially noticeable.
