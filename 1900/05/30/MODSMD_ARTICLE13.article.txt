The Class of 1900 today joins
the ever-increasing number of its
predecessors who have added their j
quota to the alumni of Stanford,
University. During our career of
four years we have seen what today
becomes our alma mater in nearly
all its stages of progress. It can
be our proud boast in later years
that we shared the trials of the
University when its very existence
was a matter of doubt, but at the

same time we leave her on the
threshold of a new life, assured of
her future forever. We appreciate
these good days the more for having
had a taste of the other side. While
we have worked for the good of
Stanford during our undergraduate
days, the possibility of rendering
her assistance grows only greater
with our departure. One hundred
and forty-one of us are sent out to
as many corners of the earth, carry
ing with us the reputation and
honor of Stanford. The responsi
bility of upholding this with dignity
and credit becomes now a part of
our life work. The members of the
Class of 1900 will do well indeed if
we display as alumni those same
characteristics of true men and
women which we have been taught
both by example and precept as
undergraduates ; and, whether we
rise to importance among our fel
low-men or go through life almost
unknown, Stanford will ever prize
us as having reached the ultimate
aim of her four years of fostering
care.
