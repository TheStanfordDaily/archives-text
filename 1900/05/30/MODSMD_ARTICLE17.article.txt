# CLASS DAY EXERCISES
## The 						Various Events and Addresses of the Day. 
### 
Monday, Class Day, was begun
at 10:30 in the morning by the ex
ercises iu the chapel. The building
was crowded with a most apprecia
tive audience.
After a number by the orchestra,
President Wickersham of the class
delivered the address of welcome:
Friends and Fellow-Students:—
111 behalf of the Class of 1900 it is
my pleasure this morning to wel
come you to our exercises, and
extend our thanks for the honor
conferred upon us by your presence
and participation in the festivities
which mark the conclusion of four
years of helpfulness and beautiful
environment at Stanford.
From the first feeble Rah, Rah,
Ru ! Ra, Ra, Re ! 1900 Century !
which startled and astonished our
guardians of the '99 Class in the
days of '96, until these exercises
this morning, the Century Class has
endeavored to uphold the traditions
of the University, and to contribute
our fourth part to the general fund
of spirit and loyalty for our Alma
Mater, which should and does
characterize every Stanford organi
zation. We have been sad yet
hopeful in the time of defeat, and
happy in the glorious victories the
Cardinal lias won.
To those who are to follow us we
leave a world of possibility. Every
where are evidences ot the growth
and increasing influence of our Uni
versity.
Those magnificent structures, the
assembly hall, library, chapel, and
science buildings, already have been
added during our short college life
time. That which was once the
center and scene of activity—the
quad now bids fair to be encircled
by one even grander in its concep
tion, and as we leave this delightful
spot, which has been the scene of
many profitable and happy hours, a
picture of future years is before us,
when all shall be consummated, and
the noble efforts of the three whom
we love to honor, yet can never re
pay, are rewarded.
We are grateful for all the kindly
chidings of the upper-class men, who
in our infancy interested themselves
in the naughty Freshmen. In the
ranks of '97, '98, and '99 we have
met those whose noble examples
and influence will ever be a source
of encouragement to us. We have
endeavored to faithfully perform the
duties as their successors, and as
we leave the stage of active Stanford
life to join them we feel that others
are ready to take our place who will
ever reflect credit to our Alma
Mater. We give our sincerest
wishes for their success.
, For our esteemed President and
the faculty there exists in our hearts
only the kindliest feeling and sense
of appreciation for the immeasurable
good they have done us. For the
years of labor and noble example
which they have lived we are truly
grateful.
We came to Stanford at a peculiar
period in its history. The time
prior to our birth had been a
dark one At one time it seemed
as though the efforts of those who
had guarded and sacrificed for the
perpetuation of this now glorious
institution were to be iu vain.
But 110; the dark shadow of
litigation was dissipated, and the
Century Class found upon its advent
a university which was to be lasting
and whose future was all brightness
After four years of prosperity, the
enthusiasm and forward march is
in 110 way diminished, but rather is
it increased an hundred fold, and

the progress of that time but serves j
as an additional stimulus for still l
greater development in the Uuiver-1
sity and in its men and women.
To her whose life has been one
incessant effort to make others
happy, and to bring out the best in '
them, we would give all thanks. (
Especially has she been near to us,
and our feeble words can never ex
press how deeply we appreciate all
she has done for us. Only by liv
ing up to the standards and ideals
which she in her devotion to a
noble work has placed before us,
can we show her our loyalty, and
that the seed has fallen upon good
ground and will bring forth a boun-1
teous harvest. Her relations with
us will constitute one of the most
j lasting memories which the members
I of the Century Class will take away,
i and wherever we may be, there
j will be heard the song so dear to
! us all,
Hail! Stanford, Hail!
Professor Miller replied to Presi
dent Wickersham with an address
on "Success and Happiness." He
i assured the class that they had been i
strengthened by their four years of
work, but that they themselves must
win success by their own exertions.
After Professor Miller's address
followed the cane presentation, con
ducted by C. D. Scott, '02. He as-!
sured the Freshmen that they had
now fully reached the dignity of
: Sophomores, and would henceforth
be entitled to carry the canes.
The " History of the Class of
1900 " was then read by Miss Anna 1
G. Fraser, the class historian. It 1
is as follows :
"fwas 011 a fair day in September,
with quakings and shakings of
spirit,
But with outward calm in appear
ance, such as we had even as
Freshmen,
Almost four hundred green chil
dren swooped down on the Rev
erend McDowell
And his most worthy assistant.
Half-backs were there and short
stops, who'd crown old Stanford
with glory ;
Sprinters and hurdlers and vaulters,
who'd strive for a Cardinal vic
tory ;
All unknown in their power, the j
wearers of future white S's,
Marched 011 to the quad as mere
Freshmen.
Our start in political circles began
with a riotous meeting, made up
of a few Senior spirits, some Jun
iors, and all of the Sophomores.
With our usual kindness of nature,
we honored ourselves by electing
As president, Brodie G. Higley, a
'99, learned and mighty.
Also for our vigor and spirit, the
bleachers much needed repairing;
The football field could not be
played on, and '99 kept 011 re
joicing,
As Sophomores cheeky and boast
ful, until some wise Senior sug
gested
] A class rush, both eager and bloody.
With this we began all our vict'ries,
by tying up every poor Sopho
more,
And making them pay the express
age. With ease and quick expe
dition
We likewise brought glory to Stan
ford, by treating the poor U. C.
freshmen
To three most beautiful touchdowns
and two fine goals by Chet Mur
phy.
! Secure in the glory of victory, and
wishing to set an example,

With peace never heard of in his
tory, we faithfully swore, on our
honor,
To abide from all rushes in future
and reign in our Sophomore glory,
Leaving peace to all incoming Fresh
men.
Our second year, also triumphant,
three members of nineteen hun
dred
Won the 28 game from poor Berke
ley. The Sophomores also pro
vided
Three members and also a captain
for the baseball team's glorious
victory,
True laurels for nineteen hundred.
Then came the dark days of the
battles and struggles in far-off
Manila,
When Stanford her best and her
finest sent out to help in the
crisis.
Not only ten of our members, but
even our president mighty,
We sent to the front of the battle.
As Juniors, we increased the num
ber of triumphs and vict'ries in
all things,
We had won as Freshmen and
Sophomores. To us alone is the
glory
Of starting that mystical function,
the terrible, awful Plug Ugly
Without which no Junior in future
can don the plug, festive and bat
tered.
The greatest thing of this year, the
capture of that which was dearest
To Berkeley, that fence, 011 whose
surface are graven the name of
her Seniors,
That capture was only effected by
the bold and untiring efforts
Of certain most prominent Juniors
There is 110 need in this chronicle
to tell of the wonderful annual.
It is enough to remind you that
though there has been an offer
Of one seventy-five for a copy, 110
one has ever accepted
So prized is the book and its con
tents.
This year again from our Class
ranks was chosen the baseball
captain,
A place we have now held for three
years, with a fourth next season
in prospect.
Where in the annals of college are
records of such valiant twirlers
And catchers and runners and bat
ters ?
And now for the fame of the Senior !
Those days when 011 gridiron
and diamond
We won from each class in succes
sion, and stood alone and tri
umphant
The victors in every engagement:
For football, for track, and for
baseball.
We also provided the captains.
As Freshmen, as Soph'mores, Jun
iors, we've struggled, united in
spirit,
And now, as Seniors together, we
meet for a last sad parting.
There have been joy and sadness,
and more will come with the fu
ture
Into which we are passing, but al
ways in spirit united
We'll carry the class in our memory.
One, two, three, four: ofttimeswe'll
wish there were more.
Following this the Class Will was
read by K. B. Riley. Its liequests
are :
I, the Class of 1900, being sound
in wind and limb, and good enough
in the thinking tank not only to

keep out of the silly shop, but also
to pick the fruit of credit from the
Tree of Knowledge to the extent of
1,500,000 minutes, called hours for
short, and being entitled to 135
patches of mutton pelt, residing,
living, and dying in that certain
realm and estate known and defined
by the name and designation of
Leland Stanford Junior University,
the same being under the guidance,
control, and rule of him who is
more dazzling than the resplendent
sun, more brilliant than the most
brilliant Starr, more moony than
themooniest moon, De Starr Jordan,
with the aidance and abettance of
His Bubonic Majesty Alloyd Wick
ersham, the said realm and precinct
being bounded as follows, to-wit:
Beginning at thence; from thence to
thence; from thence to fence; from
fence to thence, and over the fence
back to earth again; I do, believing
that a rolling stone is worth two in
the bush, bequeath the following
bequests to our followers, to-wit,
viz.:
Pop Waite's cornet solos to the
man who sells fish to Winston, and
his obesity to Rabbit NVarren.
Eagan's massive brains and his
marvelous theses to the Junior Class,
the residue, if there be any, to go
to the Sophomore and succeeding
classes until exhausted.
Haslaclier's popularity to the
most unpopular man in the Junior
Class.
Murphy's sweaters to the basket
ball team. Long may they wave
is my dying and undying wish.
Lanagan'slegsto I,<>usley. Long
may they also wave.
Harry Bell's copyright 011 "Who
done it?" and " Who seen it?" to
the English department.
The Senior posters to the Japs
and those who bought them.
Our troubles with the faculty to
the policeman.
Coxey Brown's mustache to the
lawn mower.
John Ezra McDowell's notoriety
to his brother for safe keeping in
the safe.
Braden's brawn to the power
house.
Harry Taylor's talent tothe tailor.
Forty Gilchri.*>i Roberts' bull
durliam to the stock farm.
Harry Wiel's versatile musical
ability to Winifred July Morgan.
Johnny Nourse's innocence to be
deposited in the Palo Alto bank
not subject to check —to be given
the Freshman Class in the sweet
by and by.
Coffin's bow legs to any knock
kneed Johns who needs 'em.
Davis' art of grafting to the
Horticultural Society.
"To have and to Lose" to all
who had and lost.
I leave my happy home for the
cold, cold world.
As for Leiter, I leave him alone.
As for Erb, I leave him to you.
Reilly I leave to her.
111 our will we will willingly will
our hills to Bill. Collect them if
you can.
We leave the leaves, we le;> v - e what's
left;
Pray what could we leave more !
We leave our troubles all behind,
'Cause we couldn't leave 'em
before.
The meeting then adjourned to
the quadrangle in front of the new
chapel, where a place had been pre
pared in the cement walk to receive
the Class Plate. The presentation
was made by Charles Quayle of the
graduating class. President Jordan
received the plate for the University,
and then the bronze square, with
"1900" inscribed upon it, was ce
mented i*'to 'ts position.

Sprinters and hurdlers and vaulters,
who'd strive for a Cardinal vic
tory ;
All unknown in their power, the j
wearers of future white S's,
Marched 011 to the quad as mere
Freshmen.
Our start in political circles began
with a riotous meeting, made up
of a few Senior spirits, some Jun
iors, and all of the Sophomores.
With our usual kindness of nature,
we honored ourselves by electing
As president, Brodie G. Higley, a
'99, learned and mighty.
Also for our vigor and spirit, the
bleachers much needed repairing;
The football field could not be
played on, and '99 kept 011 re
joicing,
As Sophomores cheeky and boast
ful, until some wise Senior sug
gested
] A class rush, both eager and bloody.
With this we began all our vict'ries,
by tying up every poor Sopho
more,
And making them pay the express
age. With ease and quick expe
dition
We likewise brought glory to Stan
ford, by treating the poor U. C.
freshmen
To three most beautiful touchdowns
and two fine goals by Chet Mur
phy.
! Secure in the glory of victory, and
wishing to set an example,

With peace never heard of in his
tory, we faithfully swore, on our
honor,
To abide from all rushes in future
and reign in our Sophomore glory,
Leaving peace to all incoming Fresh
men.
Our second year, also triumphant,
three members of nineteen hun
dred
Won the 28 game from poor Berke
ley. The Sophomores also pro
vided
Three members and also a captain
for the baseball team's glorious
victory,
True laurels for nineteen hundred.
Then came the dark days of the
battles and struggles in far-off
Manila,
When Stanford her best and her
finest sent out to help in the
crisis.
Not only ten of our members, but
even our president mighty,
We sent to the front of the battle.
As Juniors, we increased the num
ber of triumphs and vict'ries in
all things,
We had won as Freshmen and
Sophomores. To us alone is the
glory
Of starting that mystical function,
the terrible, awful Plug Ugly
Without which no Junior in future
can don the plug, festive and bat
tered.
The greatest thing of this year, the
capture of that which was dearest
To Berkeley, that fence, 011 whose
surface are graven the name of
her Seniors,
That capture was only effected by
the bold and untiring efforts
Of certain most prominent Juniors
There is 110 need in this chronicle
to tell of the wonderful annual.
It is enough to remind you that
though there has been an offer
Of one seventy-five for a copy, 110
one has ever accepted
So prized is the book and its con
tents.
This year again from our Class
ranks was chosen the baseball
captain,
A place we have now held for three
years, with a fourth next season
in prospect.
Where in the annals of college are
records of such valiant twirlers
And catchers and runners and bat
ters ?
And now for the fame of the Senior !
Those days when 011 gridiron
and diamond
We won from each class in succes
sion, and stood alone and tri
umphant
The victors in every engagement:
For football, for track, and for
baseball.
We also provided the captains.
As Freshmen, as Soph'mores, Jun
iors, we've struggled, united in
spirit,
And now, as Seniors together, we
meet for a last sad parting.
There have been joy and sadness,
and more will come with the fu
ture
Into which we are passing, but al
ways in spirit united
We'll carry the class in our memory.
One, two, three, four: ofttimeswe'll
wish there were more.
Following this the Class Will was
read by K. B. Riley. Its liequests
are :
I, the Class of 1900, being sound
in wind and limb, and good enough
in the thinking tank not only to

keep out of the silly shop, but also

patches of mutton pelt, residing,
living, and dying in that certain
realm and estate known and defined

We leave the leaves, we le;> v - e what's

Pray what could we leave more !
We leave our troubles all behind,
'Cause we couldn't leave 'em
before.
The meeting then adjourned to
the quadrangle in front of the new
chapel, where a place had been pre
pared in the cement walk to receive
the Class Plate. The presentation
was made by Charles Quayle of the
graduating class. President Jordan
received the plate for the University,
and then the bronze square, with
"1900" inscribed upon it, was ce
mented i*'to 'ts position.
Monday, Class Day, was begun
at 10:30 in the morning by the ex
ercises iu the chapel. The building
was crowded with a most apprecia
tive audience.
After a number by the orchestra,
President Wickersham of the class
delivered the address of welcome:
Friends and Fellow-Students:—
111 behalf of the Class of 1900 it is
my pleasure this morning to wel
come you to our exercises, and
extend our thanks for the honor
conferred upon us by your presence
and participation in the festivities
which mark the conclusion of four
years of helpfulness and beautiful
environment at Stanford.
From the first feeble Rah, Rah,
Ru ! Ra, Ra, Re ! 1900 Century !
which startled and astonished our
guardians of the '99 Class in the
days of '96, until these exercises
this morning, the Century Class has
endeavored to uphold the traditions
of the University, and to contribute
our fourth part to the general fund
of spirit and loyalty for our Alma
Mater, which should and does
characterize every Stanford organi
zation. We have been sad yet
hopeful in the time of defeat, and
happy in the glorious victories the
Cardinal lias won.
To those who are to follow us we
leave a world of possibility. Every
where are evidences ot the growth
and increasing influence of our Uni
versity.
Those magnificent structures, the
assembly hall, library, chapel, and
science buildings, already have been
added during our short college life
time. That which was once the
center and scene of activity—the
quad now bids fair to be encircled
by one even grander in its concep
tion, and as we leave this delightful
spot, which has been the scene of
many profitable and happy hours, a
picture of future years is before us,
when all shall be consummated, and
the noble efforts of the three whom
we love to honor, yet can never re
pay, are rewarded.
We are grateful for all the kindly
chidings of the upper-class men, who
in our infancy interested themselves
in the naughty Freshmen. In the
ranks of '97, '98, and '99 we have
met those whose noble examples
and influence will ever be a source
of encouragement to us. We have
endeavored to faithfully perform the
duties as their successors, and as
we leave the stage of active Stanford
life to join them we feel that others
are ready to take our place who will
ever reflect credit to our Alma
Mater. We give our sincerest
wishes for their success.
, For our esteemed President and
the faculty there exists in our hearts
only the kindliest feeling and sense
of appreciation for the immeasurable
good they have done us. For the
years of labor and noble example
which they have lived we are truly
grateful.
We came to Stanford at a peculiar
period in its history. The time
prior to our birth had been a
dark one At one time it seemed
as though the efforts of those who
had guarded and sacrificed for the
perpetuation of this now glorious
institution were to be iu vain.
But 110; the dark shadow of
litigation was dissipated, and the
Century Class found upon its advent
a university which was to be lasting
and whose future was all brightness
After four years of prosperity, the
enthusiasm and forward march is
in 110 way diminished, but rather is
it increased an hundred fold, and

the progress of that time but serves j
as an additional stimulus for still l
greater development in the Uuiver-1
sity and in its men and women.
To her whose life has been one
incessant effort to make others
happy, and to bring out the best in '
them, we would give all thanks. (
Especially has she been near to us,
and our feeble words can never ex
press how deeply we appreciate all
she has done for us. Only by liv
ing up to the standards and ideals
which she in her devotion to a
noble work has placed before us,
can we show her our loyalty, and
that the seed has fallen upon good
ground and will bring forth a boun-1
teous harvest. Her relations with
us will constitute one of the most
j lasting memories which the members
I of the Century Class will take away,
i and wherever we may be, there
j will be heard the song so dear to
! us all,
Hail! Stanford, Hail!
Professor Miller replied to Presi
dent Wickersham with an address
on "Success and Happiness." He
i assured the class that they had been i
strengthened by their four years of
work, but that they themselves must
win success by their own exertions.
After Professor Miller's address
followed the cane presentation, con
ducted by C. D. Scott, '02. He as-!
sured the Freshmen that they had
now fully reached the dignity of
: Sophomores, and would henceforth
be entitled to carry the canes.
The " History of the Class of
1900 " was then read by Miss Anna 1
G. Fraser, the class historian. It 1
is as follows :
"fwas 011 a fair day in September,
with quakings and shakings of
spirit,
But with outward calm in appear
ance, such as we had even as
Freshmen,
Almost four hundred green chil
dren swooped down on the Rev
erend McDowell
And his most worthy assistant.
Half-backs were there and short
stops, who'd crown old Stanford
with glory ;
Sprinters and hurdlers and vaulters,
who'd strive for a Cardinal vic

The meeting then adjourned to
the quadrangle in front of the new
chapel, where a place had been pre
pared in the cement walk to receive
the Class Plate. The presentation
was made by Charles Quayle of the
graduating class. President Jordan
received the plate for the University,
and then the bronze square, with
"1900" inscribed upon it, was ce
mented i*'to 'ts position.
Monday, Class Day, was begun
at 10:30 in the morning by the ex
ercises iu the chapel. The building
was crowded with a most apprecia
tive audience.
After a number by the orchestra,
President Wickersham of the class
delivered the address of welcome:
Friends and Fellow-Students:—
111 behalf of the Class of 1900 it is
my pleasure this morning to wel
come you to our exercises, and
extend our thanks for the honor
conferred upon us by your presence
and participation in the festivities
which mark the conclusion of four
years of helpfulness and beautiful
environment at Stanford.
From the first feeble Rah, Rah,
Ru ! Ra, Ra, Re ! 1900 Century !
which startled and astonished our
guardians of the '99 Class in the
days of '96, until these exercises
this morning, the Century Class has
endeavored to uphold the traditions
of the University, and to contribute
our fourth part to the general fund
of spirit and loyalty for our Alma
Mater, which should and does
characterize every Stanford organi
zation. We have been sad yet
hopeful in the time of defeat, and
happy in the glorious victories the
Cardinal lias won.
To those who are to follow us we
leave a world of possibility. Every
where are evidences ot the growth
and increasing influence of our Uni
versity.
Those magnificent structures, the
assembly hall, library, chapel, and
science buildings, already have been
added during our short college life
time. That which was once the
center and scene of activity—the
quad now bids fair to be encircled
by one even grander in its concep
tion, and as we leave this delightful
spot, which has been the scene of
many profitable and happy hours, a
picture of future years is before us,
when all shall be consummated, and
the noble efforts of the three whom
we love to honor, yet can never re
pay, are rewarded.
We are grateful for all the kindly
chidings of the upper-class men, who
in our infancy interested themselves
in the naughty Freshmen. In the
ranks of '97, '98, and '99 we have
met those whose noble examples
and influence will ever be a source
of encouragement to us. We have
endeavored to faithfully perform the
duties as their successors, and as
we leave the stage of active Stanford
life to join them we feel that others
are ready to take our place who will
ever reflect credit to our Alma
Mater. We give our sincerest
wishes for their success.
, For our esteemed President and
the faculty there exists in our hearts
only the kindliest feeling and sense
of appreciation for the immeasurable
good they have done us. For the
years of labor and noble example
which they have lived we are truly
grateful.
We came to Stanford at a peculiar
period in its history. The time
prior to our birth had been a
dark one At one time it seemed
as though the efforts of those who
had guarded and sacrificed for the
perpetuation of this now glorious
institution were to be iu vain.
But 110; the dark shadow of
litigation was dissipated, and the
Century Class found upon its advent
a university which was to be lasting
and whose future was all brightness
After four years of prosperity, the
enthusiasm and forward march is
in 110 way diminished, but rather is
it increased an hundred fold, and

the progress of that time but serves j
as an additional stimulus for still l
greater development in the Uuiver-1
sity and in its men and women.
To her whose life has been one
incessant effort to make others
happy, and to bring out the best in '
them, we would give all thanks. (
Especially has she been near to us,
and our feeble words can never ex
press how deeply we appreciate all
she has done for us. Only by liv
ing up to the standards and ideals
which she in her devotion to a
noble work has placed before us,
can we show her our loyalty, and
that the seed has fallen upon good
ground and will bring forth a boun-1
teous harvest. Her relations with
us will constitute one of the most
j lasting memories which the members
I of the Century Class will take away,
i and wherever we may be, there
j will be heard the song so dear to
! us all,
Hail! Stanford, Hail!
Professor Miller replied to Presi
dent Wickersham with an address
on "Success and Happiness." He
i assured the class that they had been i
strengthened by their four years of
work, but that they themselves must
win success by their own exertions.
After Professor Miller's address
followed the cane presentation, con
ducted by C. D. Scott, '02. He as-!
sured the Freshmen that they had
now fully reached the dignity of
: Sophomores, and would henceforth
be entitled to carry the canes.
The " History of the Class of
1900 " was then read by Miss Anna 1
G. Fraser, the class historian. It 1
is as follows :
"fwas 011 a fair day in September,
with quakings and shakings of
spirit,
But with outward calm in appear
ance, such as we had even as
Freshmen,
Almost four hundred green chil
dren swooped down on the Rev
erend McDowell
And his most worthy assistant.
Half-backs were there and short
stops, who'd crown old Stanford
with glory ;
Sprinters and hurdlers and vaulters,
who'd strive for a Cardinal vic
tory ;
All unknown in their power, the j
wearers of future white S's,
Marched 011 to the quad as mere
Freshmen.
Our start in political circles began
with a riotous meeting, made up
of a few Senior spirits, some Jun
iors, and all of the Sophomores.
With our usual kindness of nature,
we honored ourselves by electing
As president, Brodie G. Higley, a
'99, learned and mighty.
Also for our vigor and spirit, the
bleachers much needed repairing;
The football field could not be
played on, and '99 kept 011 re
joicing,
As Sophomores cheeky and boast
ful, until some wise Senior sug
gested
] A class rush, both eager and bloody.
With this we began all our vict'ries,
by tying up every poor Sopho
more,
And making them pay the express
age. With ease and quick expe
dition
We likewise brought glory to Stan
ford, by treating the poor U. C.
freshmen
To three most beautiful touchdowns
and two fine goals by Chet Mur
phy.
! Secure in the glory of victory, and
wishing to set an example,

With peace never heard of in his
tory, we faithfully swore, on our
honor,
To abide from all rushes in future
and reign in our Sophomore glory,
Leaving peace to all incoming Fresh
men.
Our second year, also triumphant,
three members of nineteen hun
dred
Won the 28 game from poor Berke
ley. The Sophomores also pro
vided
Three members and also a captain
for the baseball team's glorious
victory,
True laurels for nineteen hundred.
Then came the dark days of the
battles and struggles in far-off
Manila,
When Stanford her best and her
finest sent out to help in the
crisis.
Not only ten of our members, but
even our president mighty,
We sent to the front of the battle.
As Juniors, we increased the num
ber of triumphs and vict'ries in
all things,
We had won as Freshmen and
Sophomores. To us alone is the
glory
Of starting that mystical function,
the terrible, awful Plug Ugly
Without which no Junior in future
can don the plug, festive and bat
tered.
The greatest thing of this year, the
capture of that which was dearest
To Berkeley, that fence, 011 whose
surface are graven the name of
her Seniors,
That capture was only effected by
the bold and untiring efforts
Of certain most prominent Juniors
There is 110 need in this chronicle
to tell of the wonderful annual.
It is enough to remind you that
though there has been an offer
Of one seventy-five for a copy, 110
one has ever accepted
So prized is the book and its con
tents.
This year again from our Class
ranks was chosen the baseball
captain,
A place we have now held for three
years, with a fourth next season
in prospect.
Where in the annals of college are
records of such valiant twirlers
And catchers and runners and bat
ters ?
And now for the fame of the Senior !
Those days when 011 gridiron
and diamond
We won from each class in succes
sion, and stood alone and tri
umphant
The victors in every engagement:
For football, for track, and for
baseball.
We also provided the captains.
As Freshmen, as Soph'mores, Jun
iors, we've struggled, united in
spirit,
And now, as Seniors together, we
meet for a last sad parting.
There have been joy and sadness,
and more will come with the fu
ture
Into which we are passing, but al
ways in spirit united
We'll carry the class in our memory.
One, two, three, four: ofttimeswe'll
wish there were more.
Following this the Class Will was
read by K. B. Riley. Its liequests
are :
I, the Class of 1900, being sound
in wind and limb, and good enough
in the thinking tank not only to

keep out of the silly shop, but also
to pick the fruit of credit from the
Tree of Knowledge to the extent of
1,500,000 minutes, called hours for
short, and being entitled to 135
patches of mutton pelt, residing,
living, and dying in that certain
realm and estate known and defined
by the name and designation of
Leland Stanford Junior University,
the same being under the guidance,
control, and rule of him who is
more dazzling than the resplendent
sun, more brilliant than the most
brilliant Starr, more moony than
themooniest moon, De Starr Jordan,
with the aidance and abettance of
His Bubonic Majesty Alloyd Wick
ersham, the said realm and precinct
being bounded as follows, to-wit:
Beginning at thence; from thence to
thence; from thence to fence; from
fence to thence, and over the fence
back to earth again; I do, believing
that a rolling stone is worth two in
the bush, bequeath the following
bequests to our followers, to-wit,
viz.:
Pop Waite's cornet solos to the
man who sells fish to Winston, and
his obesity to Rabbit NVarren.
Eagan's massive brains and his
marvelous theses to the Junior Class,
the residue, if there be any, to go
