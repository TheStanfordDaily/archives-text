Work on the new buildings at
Stanford University has been going
011 steadily during the past year.
January, 1900, saw the opening of
the new library, the gift of Thomas
Welton Stanford. This building,
together with that of the assembly
hall, is the first in the series of the
outer quadrangle to be completed.
The library was begun in Jnly,
IX9B, and ready for occupancy a
year and a half later The approx
imate cost of the building was
$ 150,000.
The main structure of the library
measures 86 by 100 feet. On the
lower floor is a large reading-room,
with smaller rooms for reference
adjoining it. Marble stairs lead to
the second floor, where there are
six large seminary rooms, besides
a room set aside for periodicals.
The most striking decorations of
the building are the three stained
glass windows in the south wall
above the gallery, one the figure of
Christ, one of Moses, and a third
Thomas a Kempis. These are the
personal gifts of Mrs. Stanford.
The memorial arch, finished early
this year, is one of the finest pieces
of masonry work on the coast. It
is 100 feet high, 86 feet wide, and
34 feet deep. A frieze by St.
Gaudens will be added to the arch
011 its completion by the artist
Ground was broken for the new
post-office building early in April,
and the structure will be read}' for
occupancy July Ist. It is to cost
near $7,000 and will be a great im
provement over the former cramped
quarters which have heretofore
served the University.
The new chemistry building will
be commenced next week, and work
pushed 011 it to have it ready for
occupancy at the beginning of the
college year of 1902. The building

will be situated just south of the
museum, facing the oval.
Work on the history building,
which is to be 011 the east side of
the front facade of the outer quad
rangle, will be begun in about three
months, and the work finished about
a year and a half later.
On Monday, January 29th, the
' corner-stone of the new memorial
church was laid. The stone work
of the building will be finished by
the end of this year, and the church
ready for dedication by the begin
ning of the college year of 1901.
Mrs. Stanford has just let the con
tract for a pipe organ to be placed
in the church on its completion.
