# "WHAT KNOWLEDGE IS OF MOST WORTH."
## Address to the Graduating Class by President David Starr Jordan. 
### 
The diploma which you have
just received allows you the name
of " Bachelor of Arts, with all the
rights, honors, and privileges here
or elsewhere thereunto appertain
ing." This is a very old form of
words, going back to a time when
the scholar belonged to the privi
leged classes and constituted a caste
by himself. There are no rights,
honors, or privileges attached to
your degree save those you carry
within yourselves, it does not
place you in any separate class or
give you any hold on life which
you did not have yesterday, which
you might not have without it.
It admits you to the roll of Stan
ford Alumni, beloved of your cher
ishing mother, and it bespeaks for
you the attention of the commu
nity as a youth of promise who has
had fair opportunities for training,
has used them faithfully, and from
whom growth and achievement
may be expected.
And now as we stand at
the end of the century to which
your teachers belong, and at the
beginning of the century which is
yours, it may be worth while to
glance back over the history indi
cated by these words of your di
ploma, " With all the rights, hon
ors, and privileges here or else
where thereunto appertaining."
The work you have done is verv
different from that of the youth of
promise a century ago, who cher
ished their diplomas for the sake of
those very rights, honors, and privi
leges which you will never find.
It is now forty years since Her
bert Spencer s tit rtled the educational
world with this momentous ques
tion, " What knowledge is of most
worth?" And the schoolmen of
that day in England and America
were thrown into dismay by this
question and its implication. For
to many of them the idea had never
occurred that any knowledge had
any worth whatever. The value of
higher education in their eyes was
mainly that of class distinction. It
marked out its possessor as one
above the common mass. It was
the badge of having done The
Proper Thing. It conferred for life
upon the men who received it the
same satisfaction which is ascribed
to the " Well-Dressed Feeling"
among women. To demonstrate its
excellence required no analysis of
its component parts. For it was
prescribed by the highest authority
known to the average Englishman,
theauthority which has granted him
the blessings of royalty, of nobil
ity, of ecclesiasticism—the author
ity of Tradition. And over higher
education in England forty years
ago, tradition exercised undisputed
sway. The badges of higher educa
tion were then of two sorts —the
pass badge, which conveyed social
prestige only, and the honor badge,
which guaranteed intellectual pre
cedence, as none could bear it
save after the severest competitive
struggles. Whether these struggles
were in themselves worthy, whether
the senior wrangler had fought for
anything of value to himself or to
any one else, few people gave them
selves the trouble to inquire. The
honor of wrangling was its own
reward. Pedantry was as good as
scholarship, and, being harmless to
church or state, constituted a very
ingenious and very acceptable sub
stitute for it.
It is clear that the knowledge is
of most worth which can be most

directly wrought into the fabric of
our lives. That discipline is most
valuable which will best serve us in
"quietly unfolding our own indi
vidualities."
Thus far no standard had been
agreed upon in these regards, nor
did those who had the affairs of
higher education in charge recog
nize even the possible existence of
such a standard. To substitute a
rational curriculum for a tradi
tional one, it is necessary, Mr.
Spencer maintained, to consider all
these matters soberly. "We must
settle which things it concerns us
most to know ; or, to use a word of
Bacon's, now unfortunately obso
lete— we must determine the rela
tive value of knowledges."
Mr. Spencer proceeds to "classify
in the order of their importance
the leading kinds of activity
which constitute human life.
These may be naturally arranged
into: 1. Those activities which di
rectly minister to self-preservation.
2. Those activities, which, by se-

curing the necessities of life, indi
rectly minister to self-preservation.
3. Those activities which have for
their end the rearing anil discipline
of offspring. 4. Those activities
which are involved in the mainte
nance of proper social and political
relations. 5. Those miscellaneous
activities which make up the leisure
part of life devoted to the gratifica
tion of the tastes and feelings.''
These categories of effort are
thus arranged, Mr. Spencer claims,
in something like their true order
of subordination. It is evident that
without personal sanity and safety
there can he no care for others. It.
is clear that the development of
the family precedes that of the
state, and that the performance of
personal duties in general has first
claim over the enjoyment of art
and the cultivation of the pleas
ures of leisure. It is again evident
that " acquirement of any kind has
two values—value as knowledge
and value as discipline," and hoth
these values must he considered in
estimating their final influence on
conduct.
In the matter of self-preserva

tion, the common animal instincts
are sufficient to warn us against
the grosser dangers. But the less
evident evils are not the less real,
and against many of these natural
instinct offers no protection. This
is especially true of the dangers
which arise from the complexities
of social life, into which our gre
garious impulses tend to drag us,
for with most men the instinct to
follow the mass is more powerful
than the animal instincts of warn
ing. The evils of bad food, bad
air, of the use of stimulants and
narcotics, of dissipation and vice,
are matters which an educated will
ought to help us to avoid. On all
sides we find chronic ailment or
physical weakness which wisdom
should have prevented. Hence our
education should strive to give
wisdom. Weariness, gloom, waste,
ill-health due to avoidable causes
are met everywhere about us, yet
against these our system of educa
tion provides no adequate safe
guard.

Thus Mr. Spencer conies to the
(inal answer to his question, " What
Knowledge is of Most Worth?" And
to this question as a whole and to
all parts of it he finds one answer:
" .Science.'"
Science is organized knowledge.
It should take precedenceon theone
hand over knowledge that is disor
ganized, and on the other over
classified information of whatever
sort which is merely conventional,
not resting on the eternal verities,
nor pointing the way to wiser con
duct of life.
After this rapid survey of Mr.
Spencer's position, we may raise two
inquiries. What change of per
spective must we make as a result
of forty years of activity in educa
tion ? Do the keen criticisms of
forty years ago hold against the
work of the American university
of today? Does it apply to your
own courses of study and to the
work we have done for you here ?
As to the first matter, we have
changed the point of view in one
important respect. Throughout the
essay Mr. Spencer seems to aim at
building the ideal curriculum, the

course of study best suited to the
development and happiness of the
average cultivated man. The fact
that there are other types of men
than the average, he seems in some
measure to overlook. There are
some men, for example, who are
born to administer to the aesthetic
feelings of others and to these
alone. There are some men, ''(J reek
minded and Roman-minded men,"
as Emerson called them, who will
find no surer road to culture and
effectiveness than the one trodden
in Oxford and Cambridge half a
century ago. The studies that
"open, invigorate, and enrich the
mind," to borrow a phrase of Mac
aulay, can never be obsolete with
those whose minds are open to their
tonic effect. The thoroughness and
continuity of these courses at their
best gives something of the exact
ness of knowledge and loyalty to
truth which characterize the man
of science. To force a musician or
a poet or a classicist to traverse the
whole range of the sciences might
be as unwise or as futile as to keep
a Faraday writing latin verses.
Moreover, on the exactness of this
training in the old Tripos many
great investigators have based the
thoroughness of their methods. It
is again not needful for all men to
learn all science. If it be needful,
it is impossible. From one science
the methods of all science may be
learned. Respect for knowledge is
; one of the noblest lessons which
real knowledge teaches.
In other words, Mr. Spencer does
not seem clearly to realize that each
course of study must be individ
ual. Each man should follow as
near as may be that line of effort
| which will do the most for him,
which will enable him to realize
the best possibilities of his own life.
There is no single curriculum, no
ideal curriculum, and any prear
ranged course of advanced study is
an affront to the mind of the real
student. We may admit that the
great need of civilized man in each
of Mr. Spencer's five categories is
science But the need is rather that
science should exist in the com
munity, that men should realize
the value of exact knowledge and
respect its teachings. Among men
must exist a division of labor. No
one man can master even a single
branch of science. Mastery means
willingness to forego knowledge in
other fields. A fixed curriculum
even in science, covering a wide
range, would necessitate super
ficiality in all. The real need,
as indicated by Mr. Spencer, is
therefore met by full provis
ion for the teaching of each of
the sciences he names and many
others, while anions these the stu
dent is free to choose for himself.
We ask not that Science lie placed
in the curriculum, for we can toler
ate no curriculum. The course of
study itself is a relic of Mediaeval
ism. We ask that Science be made
accessible to all and in all stagesof
education. The rest will take care
of itself. Constructive individual
ism, building up the man, is the
central idea of university develop
ment, in America as in CJermany.
And the man we build is not man
in general but the particular one
on whom we are working.
Let me recall a discussion, also
forty years old, which then took
place between Emerson and Agassiz.
Emerson, t hough one of the sanest
and broadest of men, yet saw in the
work of Agassiz elements of dan
ger, whereby the time-honored
symmetry of Harvard might be
destroyed. In a lecture on IJniver
i sities, in Boston, Kmerson made the

statement that natural history was
"getting too great an ascendency
at Harvard"; that it " was out of
proportion to the other depart
ments," and hinted "that a check
rein would not be amiss on the
enthusiastic young professor who is
responsible for this."
" Do you not see," Agassiz wrote
to Emerson, in response, "that the
way to bring about a well-propor
tiwned development of all the re
sources of the university is not to
check the natural history depart
ment, but to stimulate all the
others ? Not that the zoological
school grows too fast, but that the
others do not grow fast enough ?
This sounds invidious and perhaps
boastful somewhat; but it is you,"
he said, "and not I, who have in
stituted the comparison, it strikes
me that you have not hit upon the
best remedy for this want of bal
ance. If symmetry is to be ob
tained by cutting down the most
vigorous growth, it seems to me it
would be better to have a little
irregularity here and there. In
stimulating by every means in my
power the growth of the museum
and the means of education con
nected with it, 1 am far from having
a selfish wish to see my own de
partment tower above the others.
1 wish that every one of my col
leagues would make it hard for me
to keep up with him ; and there are
some, 1 am happy to say, who are
ready to run a race with me."
In these words of Agassiz may be
seen the key-note of modern uni
versity progress. The university
should be the great refuge-but on
the ultimate boundaries of knowl
edge, from which, daily and weekly,
adventurous bands set out on voy
ages of discovery. It should be the
Upernavik from which Polar trav
elers draw their supplies, and as
the shoreless sea of the unknown
meets us on every side, tbe same
house of refuge and supply will
serve for a thousand different ex
ploring parties, moving out in every
direction into the infinite ocean.
Emersononce wrote to his daugh
ter : " It matters little what your
studies are: it all lies in who your
teacher is." For he saw clearly one
of the most important facts in edu
cation, that a great teacher must
leave a great mark on every student
whose life he touches.
The essential character of the
university is Lehrfreiheit, the free
dom of the teacher to give out the
best that is in him and Lernfrei
heit, the freedom of the student to
demand tbe best the teacher can
give. The one develops the other.
Good students make good teachers.
The freedom of the student to ask
what he needs stimulates theteacher
to give what he demands. The
teacher who can give his best and
find it appreciated forthwith rises
to higher levels of power. The
standard of his associates must rise
to keep pace with him.
P.ut leaving these matters aside,
let us ask, Do the criticisms of Her
bert Spencer of forty years ago
apply to the American university
of today? Are the fundamentals
of self-preservation, professional
soundness, family integrity, good
citizenship, sacrificed to a conven
tional culture, part ajsthetic, part
aristocratic, part traditional, and
in all ways remote from the needs
of life? To say that this is not
true in the American university of
today, is to say thai its work is
democratic,practical, scientific, and
free. That it is all so, we can eas
ily show. The change in these
years readily appears in the records
of those institutions which have
been free to develop with the growth

of the republic. In the first place,
the university of today is essen
tially democratic, not aristocratic.
Its work is planned to meet the
needs of the actual people, not to
I separate a choice few as a class
I apart. Its function is to strengthen
democracy with men fitted to make
j rule of the people the best govern
ment that exists. And this fact
the people fully appreciate. It is
the sons of men, not the budding
aristocrats, who throng our college
halls. The large numbers testify
to the largeness of the need which
the university meets. And the di
ploma of the university no longer
sets a man apart as a member of a
special or privileged class. It tes
tifies simply that he is "a youth of
promise," fitted to take his place in
the work of the world.
With the democracy among men
conies the democracy of studies.
The old-time Tripos held sway be
cause its chosen studies were sacred
while all others are plebeian. In
the new education all powers of the
human mind are sacred alike. It
is the business of the university to
train them, to stimulate them all,
not to repress the many for the
sake of the few. The student of the
human body, the investigator of
matter and force, the lover of Greek
art, all meet on equal ground on
the university's hospitable campus.
No longer are the prizes of scholar
ship offered for boy's play among
Latin verbs or mathematical puz
zles while the serious worker among
things as they are encounters a
barred door. The rewards of know
ing and doing are offered to all
alike. They are the power to know
and do, the only legitimate prizes
of the real university. To place
all men and all studies on one foot
ing is to make a real republic of
learning. This once done, the ques
tion of " What Knowledge is of Most
Worth ?" is one for each man to
answer for himself. What knowl
edge is worth most to me ? And the
very attempt to answer this ques
tion is in itself one of the most im
portant factors in hi o hereducation.
That each should answer it for him
self is the essential element in the
freedom of the university, and each
year as it passes sees the American
university more democratic and
more free.
That the work should be practi
cal means that it should be con
ducted by competent teachers. Dar
win tells ns that the lectures in
geology in Edinburgh in his day
were so "incredibly dull" that he
resolved that he would have " noth
ing more to do with the subject,
nor ever to read a book upon it.''
Such teaching was not practical,
for the subject matter of geology is
of interest to whomever comes into
intelligent contact with it. The
most practical teaching is that in
which the subject is borne most
I strongly to the student's mind.
I The professorship in Harvard, let
| us say, is not given as a reward for
social or ecclesiastical distinction
or for a competitive tour deforce in
memory. It is given to those schol
ars who know how to teach, who
know how to reach the heart of
their subjects for themselves, and
to bring their students to the same
vitalizing contact. And in tbe
choice of teachers the demands of
democracy are always considered.
In each department is wanted the
best that there is, and no depart
ment of rational human interest is
overlooked or slighted.
Is the American university sci
entific? If we answer yes, we do
not mean that science only is stud
ied, nor even that every individual
student is giving attention to sci

enee. "America means opportu
nity," and the American university
is an intensification of this same
definition of Emerson's. The uni
versity does it part not in forcing
the student over a curriculum of
all sciences or of any sciences. It
has only to make generous pro
vision for the teaching of each and
all of them, and to leave the rest
to the student. The cost of teach
ing science is far greater than that
of teaching language and mathe
matics. The vast endowments of
our great universities of today find
their justification in this fact.
These schools are trying honestly
to bring before the student the pos
sibilities of human knowledge. The
individual sciences are not favored
at the expense of the traditional
subjects. More money is spent on
the teaching of Greek today than
ever before, but Greek no longer
occupies an exclusive position. It
is not an object of worship while
physiology is an object of contempt.
Once thrown to the democratic level,
we find the classics of Greece really
exalted. Homer and Euripides
are studied now for their own sakes,
not for the badge or hood or gown
or social distinction they may in a
roundabout way confer. So they
are studied by scholars with the
methods and purposes of a scholar,
not by recalcitrant schoolboys,
driven over an unwilling race
course in response to the demands
of tradition. To say that the uni
versity is . scientific is to siiy that
it is genuine, that it is devoted to
realities, not to make-believes and
shams, it is said that "Respect
the Outside" was a favored motto
of the old education in England.
Hut science does not respect the
outside, it aims lo go to the very
heart of things, and in proportion
to the extension of its spirit do we
witness the disappearance of caste
and conventions. The things men
agree to pretend to be true vanish
at the touch of truth.
It is true that we have in Amer
ica not a few institutions in which
the traditional ideals are still cher
ished, and to which the criticisms
of Mr. Spencer still apply in full
force. Hut these are not typical,
and their influence is not growing.
The students go where they can
get what they want, and the Zeit
geist responds to their demand.
The American university of today
is moulded by the best scientific
thoughtof the century. One of the
voices to which it has responded is
that of Herbert Spencer. And the
essence of his criticism has found
positive expression in the construc
tive work of the great university
builders of our republic. Let the
young man or young woman of to
day ask, " What knowledge is of
most worth to me ?" In the course
of study of our American universities
will be found the unhampered an
swer, the answer of Herbert Spencer,
if you like, the answer of Agassiz, or
Emerson, or Eliot,or White, the ma
terials for your own answer, what
ever it be. And whatever you may
require you will not be turned away
empty-handed.
The progress of the next half
century will be not in development
of new lines in education, but in
intensification of the work we are
now doing. It will be in develop
ing better teachers, and in closer
contact between teacher and pupil.
We must realize that the needs of
the student form the sole reason for
the university's existence. It is
built that it may help men Forty
years ago in English universities
the good teacher was the very
rare exception, and was practically
found only among the private tu

tors dependent for a living on the
young men they taught. The uni
versity professors held their posi
tions as sinecures, rewards for birth
or breeding or efforts in the past,
but requiring no expenditure of
force in the present. These insti
tutions in those days were not
universities at all. They were sim
ply ingenious substitutes furnished
by a state and a church that feared
the dynamic force of real learning,
and tried to satisfy by form and
play instead.
There was a time when the am
bition to be a good teacher was
regarded in some of our colleges as
an ignoble one. The college pro
fessor was a being of a higher or
der, temporarily in hard luck,
because he was forced for a living
to sit out his days before classes of
unwilling boys. To be above one's
work was held as the maintenance
of proper academic dignity.
This condition is rapidly pass
ing. The college professor, like
other men, is judged by what he
does. Yet even now, too small a
percentage of the men who hold the
professor's chair can be called good
teachers. The real work of most
institutions rests on the shoulders
of a very few men. The others
mark time and assign tasks, their
personality counting for little. The
progress of education demands that
this condition should be remedied.
Every man who holds a college
chair should directly contribute to
higher education. It is not his
knowledge alone which concerns
the student. His effectiveness lies
in his personality, the manhood
that is in him, the man that he is.
The best teacher —other things
equal —is the one who comes near
est to the student To bring the
teacher close to the student is to
multiply his influence many fold.
The very usefulness of our universi
ties tends to weaken the bond of
personal influence. It makes them
popular, and therefore populous.
The man is lost in the mass, and,
because the mass is so great, cheap
or temporary help is brought in,
and the professor is pushed away
still further from the student. It is
the problem of the modern univer
sity to remedy this condition. In
the old-time college everyone knew
every one else, and if, perchance, in
the small number one great teacher
found place, the lives of all the
others were richer in consequence.
But in the university of today, with
its array of great teachers, of noble
investigators, of men whose names
are known wherever civilization ex
tends, the mere student may see
none of them. Temporary assist
ants, less experienced and less ca
pable than those he left in the
academy, may be the only teachers
he can reach. When this is the
condition, higher education has lost
a large part of its effectiveness.
A Japanese writer, Uchimura,
says thisof education in old Japan:
"We were not taught in classes
then. The grouping of soul-bear
ing human beings into classes, as
sheep upon Australian farms, was
not known in ourold schools. Our
teachers believed, I think instinc
tively, that man (persona ) is un
classifiable ; that he must be dealt
with personally— i.e. face to face,
and soul to soul. So they schooled
us one by one, — each according to
his idiosyncrasies, physical, mental,
and spiritual. They knew each one
of uk by name
Thus it was in old Japan. Thus
should it be in new America. In such
manner do the oldest ideas forever
renew their youth, when these ideas
are based, not on tradition or con
vention, but in the nature of man.
