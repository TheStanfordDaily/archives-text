# "WHAT KNOWLEDGE IS OF MOST WORTH."
## Address to the Graduating Class by President David Starr Jordan. 
### 
The diploma which you have
just received allows you the name
of " Bachelor of Arts, with all the
rights, honors, and privileges here
or elsewhere thereunto appertain
ing." This is a very old form of
words, going back to a time when
the scholar belonged to the privi
leged classes and constituted a caste
by himself. There are no rights,
honors, or privileges attached to
your degree save those you carry
within yourselves, it does not
place you in any separate class or
give you any hold on life which
you did not have yesterday, which
you might not have without it.
It admits you to the roll of Stan
ford Alumni, beloved of your cher
ishing mother, and it bespeaks for
you the attention of the commu
nity as a youth of promise who has
had fair opportunities for training,
has used them faithfully, and from
whom growth and achievement
may be expected.
And now as we stand at
the end of the century to which
your teachers belong, and at the
beginning of the century which is
yours, it may be worth while to
glance back over the history indi
cated by these words of your di
ploma, " With all the rights, hon
ors, and privileges here or else
where thereunto appertaining."
The work you have done is verv
different from that of the youth of
promise a century ago, who cher
ished their diplomas for the sake of
those very rights, honors, and privi
leges which you will never find.
It is now forty years since Her
bert Spencer s tit rtled the educational
world with this momentous ques
tion, " What knowledge is of most
worth?" And the schoolmen of
that day in England and America
were thrown into dismay by this
question and its implication. For
to many of them the idea had never
occurred that any knowledge had
any worth whatever. The value of
higher education in their eyes was
mainly that of class distinction. It
marked out its possessor as one
above the common mass. It was
the badge of having done The
Proper Thing. It conferred for life
upon the men who received it the
same satisfaction which is ascribed
to the " Well-Dressed Feeling"
among women. To demonstrate its
excellence required no analysis of
its component parts. For it was
prescribed by the highest authority
known to the average Englishman,
theauthority which has granted him
the blessings of royalty, of nobil
ity, of ecclesiasticism—the author
ity of Tradition. And over higher
education in England forty years
ago, tradition exercised undisputed
sway. The badges of higher educa
tion were then of two sorts —the
pass badge, which conveyed social
prestige only, and the honor badge,
which guaranteed intellectual pre
cedence, as none could bear it
save after the severest competitive
struggles. Whether these struggles
were in themselves worthy, whether
the senior wrangler had fought for
anything of value to himself or to
any one else, few people gave them
selves the trouble to inquire. The
honor of wrangling was its own
reward. Pedantry was as good as
scholarship, and, being harmless to
church or state, constituted a very
ingenious and very acceptable sub
stitute for it.
It is clear that the knowledge is
of most worth which can be most

directly wrought into the fabric of
our lives. That discipline is most
valuable which will best serve us in
"quietly unfolding our own indi
vidualities."
Thus far no standard had been
agreed upon in these regards, nor
did those who had the affairs of
higher education in charge recog
nize even the possible existence of
such a standard. To substitute a
rational curriculum for a tradi
tional one, it is necessary, Mr.
Spencer maintained, to consider all
these matters soberly. "We must
settle which things it concerns us
most to know ; or, to use a word of
Bacon's, now unfortunately obso
lete— we must determine the rela
tive value of knowledges."
Mr. Spencer proceeds to "classify
in the order of their importance
the leading kinds of activity
which constitute human life.
These may be naturally arranged
into: 1. Those activities which di
rectly minister to self-preservation.
2. Those activities, which, by se-

curing the necessities of life, indi
rectly minister to self-preservation.
3. Those activities which have for
their end the rearing anil discipline
of offspring. 4. Those activities
which are involved in the mainte
nance of proper social and political
relations. 5. Those miscellaneous
activities which make up the leisure
part of life devoted to the gratifica
tion of the tastes and feelings.''
These categories of effort are
thus arranged, Mr. Spencer claims,
in something like their true order
of subordination. It is evident that
without personal sanity and safety
there can he no care for others. It.
is clear that the development of
the family precedes that of the
state, and that the performance of
personal duties in general has first
claim over the enjoyment of art
and the cultivation of the pleas
ures of leisure. It is again evident
that " acquirement of any kind has
two values—value as knowledge
and value as discipline," and hoth
these values must he considered in
estimating their final influence on
conduct.
In the matter of self-preserva

tion, the common animal instincts
are sufficient to warn us against
the grosser dangers. But the less
evident evils are not the less real,
and against many of these natural
instinct offers no protection. This
is especially true of the dangers
which arise from the complexities
of social life, into which our gre
garious impulses tend to drag us,
for with most men the instinct to
follow the mass is more powerful
than the animal instincts of warn
ing. The evils of bad food, bad
air, of the use of stimulants and
narcotics, of dissipation and vice,
are matters which an educated will
ought to help us to avoid. On all
sides we find chronic ailment or
physical weakness which wisdom
should have prevented. Hence our
education should strive to give
wisdom. Weariness, gloom, waste,
ill-health due to avoidable causes
are met everywhere about us, yet
against these our system of educa
tion provides no adequate safe
guard.

Thus Mr. Spencer conies to the
(inal answer to his question, " What
Knowledge is of Most Worth?" And
to this question as a whole and to
all parts of it he finds one answer:
" .Science.'"
Science is organized knowledge.
It should take precedenceon theone
hand over knowledge that is disor
ganized, and on the other over
classified information of whatever
sort which is merely conventional,
not resting on the eternal verities,
nor pointing the way to wiser con
duct of life.
After this rapid survey of Mr.
Spencer's position, we may raise two
inquiries. What change of per
spective must we make as a result
of forty years of activity in educa
tion ? Do the keen criticisms of
forty years ago hold against the
work of the American university
of today? Does it apply to your
own courses of study and to the
work we have done for you here ?
As to the first matter, we have
changed the point of view in one
important respect. Throughout the
essay Mr. Spencer seems to aim at
building the ideal curriculum, the

course of study best suited to the
development and happiness of the
average cultivated man. The fact
that there are other types of men
than the average, he seems in some
measure to overlook. There are
some men, for example, who are
born to administer to the aesthetic
feelings of others and to these
alone. There are some men, ''(J reek
minded and Roman-minded men,"
as Emerson called them, who will
find no surer road to culture and
effectiveness than the one trodden
in Oxford and Cambridge half a
century ago. The studies that
"open, invigorate, and enrich the
mind," to borrow a phrase of Mac
aulay, can never be obsolete with
those whose minds are open to their
tonic effect. The thoroughness and
continuity of these courses at their
best gives something of the exact
ness of knowledge and loyalty to
truth which characterize the man
of science. To force a musician or
a poet or a classicist to traverse the
whole range of the sciences might
be as unwise or as futile as to keep
a Faraday writing latin verses.
Moreover, on the exactness of this
training in the old Tripos many
great investigators have based the
thoroughness of their methods. It
is again not needful for all men to
learn all science. If it be needful,
it is impossible. From one science
the methods of all science may be
learned. Respect for knowledge is
; one of the noblest lessons which
real knowledge teaches.
In other words, Mr. Spencer does
not seem clearly to realize that each
course of study must be individ
ual. Each man should follow as
near as may be that line of effort
| which will do the most for him,
which will enable him to realize
the best possibilities of his own life.
There is no single curriculum, no
ideal curriculum, and any prear
ranged course of advanced study is
an affront to the mind of the real
student. We may admit that the
great need of civilized man in each
of Mr. Spencer's five categories is
science But the need is rather that
science should exist in the com
munity, that men should realize
the value of exact knowledge and
respect its teachings. Among men
must exist a division of labor. No
one man can master even a single
branch of science. Mastery means
willingness to forego knowledge in
other fields. A fixed curriculum
even in science, covering a wide
range, would necessitate super
ficiality in all. The real need,
as indicated by Mr. Spencer, is
therefore met by full provis
ion for the teaching of each of
the sciences he names and many
others, while anions these the stu
dent is free to choose for himself.
We ask not that Science lie placed
in the curriculum, for we can toler
ate no curriculum. The course of
study itself is a relic of Mediaeval
ism. We ask that Science be made
accessible to all and in all stagesof
education. The rest will take care
of itself. Constructive individual
ism, building up the man, is the
central idea of university develop
ment, in America as in CJermany.
And the man we build is not man
in general but the particular one
on whom we are working.
Let me recall a discussion, also
forty years old, which then took
place between Emerson and Agassiz.
Emerson, t hough one of the sanest
and broadest of men, yet saw in the
work of Agassiz elements of dan
ger, whereby the time-honored
symmetry of Harvard might be
destroyed. In a lecture on IJniver
i sities, in Boston, Kmerson made the
