# THREE STANFORD CAPTAINS.
## Men Who Will Have Charge of Our Athletic Interests Next Fall. 
### 
In the three men who have been
chosen to lead our athletes next
season in their different lines, Stan
ford feels that too great confidence
cannot be placed. Each of them
has proved himself worthy of the
honor by actual work, and all are
fitted by experience to bring victory
to the cardinal if it is within the
power of a captain to do so.
W. YV. Burnett, '01, who will lead
the football men next fall, is known
to every Stanford man for the fame
he won in the 28-to-0 game as
center. His breaking through the
line and fierce tackling were feat
ures of the game. The next season,
as " Babe," though in Manila with
the Stanford volunteers, Burnett
was with us in spirit in our songs.
Last year he further distinguished
himself as tackle, though early in
the season the tropical climate
seemed to have undermined his
strength. Burnett has plans for
next year which will make the
season an interesting and, it is felt,
a successful one from the start.
As track captain, Arthur B.Stew
art, '01, will be the conscientious
worker for Stanford that he has
been for the last three years. It
was this determination that brought
him distinction in the field-day of
1899 as winner of the 100-yard
dash. He has this last season been
a consistent trainer. In him the
track men are sure of a leader who
will encourage them by example as
well as precept to conform to all
regulations which are necessary to
successful training.
James F. Lanagan, '00, who was
last week elected baseball captain
for next spring, is well known for
his work in the box during the last
two seasons. His steady work this
year was a characteristic of the
team. It is well recognized that in
him we have a twirier and captain
who can be depended upon to do
his utmost to bring the intercol
legiate series of 1901 to the car
dinal.
