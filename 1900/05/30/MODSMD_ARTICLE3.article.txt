# Faculty-Senior Baseball.

### 
The annual game between the
Faculty and Seniors, the only event
of the year in which the former
have an opportunity to show that
they have not entirely forgotten

former athletic prowess, took place
on the campus diamond Saturday
morning. There were some thous
and spectators in the second inning.
At the end of the seventh inning
the Seniors found themselves one
score to the short with the faculty
having an unused bat Thus in
telligence has proved just too much
for '00, both of them having been
beaten by one run.
The Senior team was an undigni
fied and motley crew as it came
on the diamond at about 10:30
Whiskers —long, whits, stingy ones
—predominated among them though
a few wore smooth faces Kach
seemed to have chosen his own
costume, and theie was every one
there from the easy farmer to the
fake patent-medicine man with the
stove-pipe. The silly man with
red sideburns and bald head even
was there and occupied the box for
a while.
The graduates seemed to think
they would have a snap, but sun
and the faculty soon made them
shed their superfluous togs and play
ball. The effort come too late, how
ever, the men of intelligence having
piled n]) eight runs in the second.
Among the faculty, President
Jordan at first, Dr. Richardson be
hilid the bat, Prof Kellogg at
s coikl, and Prof. Newsom at short,
were the stars of the day. All the
Seniors deserve comment
Following was the revised score:
