### 
Fully a thousand people well
filled the assembly hall Saturday
evening to see the presentation of
the farce " To Have and to Lose,"
which had caused so much com
ment. Everything went remarka
bly smoothly for the short time that
had necessarily been given to prep
aration. VV. M. Krb, 'oi, who had
the leading role, well merited the
favorable comment he received.
The farce as a whole was some
what more on the Orpheum style
than university shows should be,

but it certainly had the merit of be
ing well carried out.

were as follows:
