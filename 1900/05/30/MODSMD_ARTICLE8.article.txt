# Baccalaureate Sermon.

### 
Dr. Voorsangerof San Francisco
delivered the sermon to the gradu
ating class.
The text chosen was taken from
Isaiah xxvi, 2 : "Open ye the gates,
that there may enter the righteous
nation which guardeth the truth."
Dr. Voorsanger spoke in part as
follows :
" If you look upon the whole
galaxy of Jewish idealists, includ
ing Jesus of Nazareth, who railed
against a status quo as morbid pes
simists, refusing to accept every
thing that came from man's hand
or brain as inevitably tending to
the happiness of society, you will
never understand their mission. A
prophet, commonly denoted as one
who predicts events, is a restless
scold, who gives complaisant society
an occasional tongue-lashing. He
thinks that society needs it, and in
this society differs from him. So
ciety says that all that is, is well.
He who prods the multitude into
thinking will never be popular.
The prophet is the man of tomorrow
who hopes to insure humanity.
That never was a fashionable occu
pation.
"The great trouble is that you
cannot induce the world to live ac
cording to the standards which the
oretically it pronounces to be re
vealed of God 011 high.
"You yourselves may have to
decide some time whether an honest
man's free speech is an offense
against society, or whether it is an
essential duty to recover the lost
ideals of righteousness. These
doors will soon be closed upon you,
the sound of your departing foot
steps will soon be heard. Are you
the multitude, or are you of them
who, like Gideon's band, never
bend the knee to Baal? Have you
any ideals to bring back from Stan
ford University ? Were you taught
those standards which, while the
world may rail at them, are abso
lutely the only standards by which
the world contest is conducted ? You
will hear from ten thousand pulpits
that we are a God-favored nation
heralding the advent of the noblest
principles of self-government, but
when you look close you will dis
cover contrasts that make your
heart ache.
"It may be that in seeking sol
diers for a struggle for right we
will find few recruits, but truth
needs but a small army. The man
who dares to speak out with fear
less denunciation that society is vio
lating the ideals for which it pays
to hehr propounded 011 Sundays,
maybe an unfashionable crank, but
his voice does not fall in the desert.
The years of God belong to 110 con
queror of nations. Of all issues
that agitated antiquity, the only sur
viving one is whether truth and
right shall finally prevail. When
ever the ideals of righteousness are
absent, the hand of time holds the
spade that puts nations into their
graves.
"Therefore men and women of
Stanford cultivate high standards.
Personal righteousness insures the
future of the nation. The righteous
man is he, who, knowing the divine
ideals of righteousness, dares to ap
ply them. We need men who will
courageously approach the busy,
bustling world with an inquiry
whether, nineteen hundred years
after Jesus, it were not time to har
monize the old ideals of righteous
ness with the lines of conduct our
era carves out for the future. Do
not theorize 011 the good and act
the hypocrite. Preach as you act.
Try to induce men to follow your
standards. If you do this, I do not
promise you a hereafter in which

beatitude means the paralysis of all
energy, but I promise you your
share in the immortality of the
American nation, which, with God
as its leader, shall pass through
Isaiah's gates and face the future
with a message that the sins of the
past shall expire with the genera
tions that made this earth a desert."
