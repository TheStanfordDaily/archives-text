# FOOTBALL OUTLOOK.
## A 						Review of Stanford's Prospects on the Gridiron This Season. 
### 
Fielding H. Yost, who will coach
the Stanford team this season, ar
rived on the campus Tuesday, Aug
ust 21st, and ever since has been
busy sizing up new football mate
rial and putting the men through
light preliminary practice in order
to put them into condition for
the regular practice to commence
within a few days. As a coach and
player Yost lias achieved a brill
iant record, lie was tackle on the
Lafayette team the year that col
lege defeated Pennsylvania, and
later was on the all-star aggrega
tion of Pittsburg. In 1897 he
coached Ohio YVesleyan, which that
year tied Michigan by a score of
0-0. In 18U8 the Nebraska team
under his coaching became the
champions of the Middle West.
Last season he was head coach of
the Kansas team, turning out a
team that did not meet defeat the
entire season.
Following is a summary of the
football material at present in col
lege :
" Babe " Burnett, captain this
season, has been a member of the
Varsity for two seasons. In his
sophomore year he was center on
the victorious 28-0 team, and has
been considered the best center
Stanford ever had. Last season he
played nuhi tackle.
The other members of last, year's
Varsity who have returned to col
lege are: J. G. de Forest, '01, left
guard; Ed Oilman, '01, right
guard; W. M. Erb, 01, half; F. H.
Boren, '02, full; R. S. Fisher, '02,
right half-back; W. I. Traeger, '03,
left tackle; 11. S. Lee, '03, center;
and 0. B. Raitt, '03, quarter. T.
L. McFadden, '00, who played left
end, is expected to return lo col
lege in a few days.
Among the members of the sec
ond team who have returned are
K. F. Oooper, '02; .J. A. Bentley,
'01; J. T. Nourse, '00; R B. Bid
well, '00; and C. P. Allen, '03.
Prominent among the new ma
terial, of course, is Frank Slaker,
the famous full-back of the Univer
sity of Chicago, who has entered
Stanford Ibis fall. As a football
player Slaker has a most enviable
record, and there can be no doubt
that he will do much to strengthen
the Cardinal.
In regard to the material in the
incoming class, it is impossible to
say anything definite Manager
Gildersleeve has issued a circular
for all freshmen who wish to play
to meet with him and receive their
suits. However, from the material
already in evidence there can be no
doubt that a strong freshman team
will be putin the field.
The football season opens very
favorably. Manager Gildersleeve
since his return from the East has
been very busy putting the gridiron
in shape. I bis year the football
field has been moved to the interior
of the oval, as the turf field inside
the cinder track affords a more de
sirable field. The grounds have
been put into shape, rolled and
watered, and they are now in first
class condition and ready for prac
tice.

Manager Gildersleeve has rented
the old Kappa Alpha Theta house,
on the row, for a training-house,
and it will be tilted up with shower
baths, rubbing-rooms, and accom
modations for the squad. The
manager proposes to make this
place the general football headquar
ters, and later, doubtless, the train
ing table will be established here.
"Billy" McLeod, who has held
the position of rubber and trainer
for the last three years, has re
turned from Portland and is at his
old duties. W. H. Murphy, who
was trainer last season and also
coached the baseball and track
teams, returned yesterday to re
sume his duties as football trainer.
The schedule of practice games
will soon be announced. This year
a team from the Reliance Athletic
Club will be organized to play a
series of games with Stanford and
Berkeley. This year the opening
of the season will fall to Stanford
and the first game is arranged for
September 29th on the campus.
