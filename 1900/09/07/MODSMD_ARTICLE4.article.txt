# NEW BUILDINGS
## An Account of the Improvements Now Under Way on the Campus. 
### 
No more convincing evidence of
the outward prosperity of the Uni
versity could be shown the possible
skeptic than the mushroom growth
of buildings now springing up on
the campus. Notwithstanding the
ample lecture-room and laboratory
space afforded by the structures of
the original quadrangle, it has long
since been apparent that the Uni
versity has outgrown its accommo
dations, and that further increase
in the number of students must
be met by enlarged facilities for
handling the same. So urgent was
the need that Mrs. Stanford even
had it in mind at one time to take
the necessary funds from the prin
cipal of the endowment, and go
ahead with the original plans of
the founders. But the sale of the
Pacific Railroad holdings put a new
face on the matter. An income in
excess of the running expenses of
the University was immediately
available, and during the summer
ground was broken for four new
buildings in addition to those al
ready in process of construction.
The first of these is to be devoted
to the uses of the Chemistry de
partment. It is somewhat isolated
from the quadrangle proper, being
situated southwest of the Museum,
between that structure and Roble.
The height is two stories and the
frontage 200 feet. When completed
it will contain every convenience
for scientific study.
The foundations are now under
way for two buildings, which are to
stand at the corners of the outer
quadrangle, adjoining the Science
Hall and the Library respectively.
The one on the west is intended for
the departments of Philosophy,
Psychology, and Education, while
the History, Economics, and Eng
lish headquarters will be found in
its counterpart on the east front.
Both of these buildings will be con
nected with other buildings by fa
cades. The architectural motif is
similar to that of the older struct
ure. Excavations are also being
carried on for an Engineering build
ing on the east end of the outer
quadrangle, facing the Inn.
Work on the Memorial Chapel has
been delayed on account of the steel
girders, which were out of propor
tion with the stone supports. The
necessary changes have been made,
and the work is now under way
again. It will be over a year, how
ever, before the building is com
pleted. Science Hall has been
rushed forward, and the stonework
is now almost finished. The Me
morial Arch is also receiving the
finishing touches in shape of a
heroic frieze illustrating "The
Progress of Civilization." St. Gau
dens, the eminent American sculp
tor, was the designer of the frieze,
but the work is being done under
the direction of the San Francisco
sculptor, Rupert Schmidt.
Besides these changes connected
with the quadrangle proper other
new buildings have been erected
and changes made on the campus,
until returning students have ditfi
culty in recognizing the place
which they left in the spring. The

new postoffice on Lasuen avenue
is ready for occupancy, and on the
same street nine new residences
have been erected, with un aggre
gate cost of $75,000. Four of these
Mrs. Stanford has built for faculty
use, and the Chi Psi, Alpha Phi,
Kappa Alpha Theta, and Delta
Gamma fraternities and sororities
have each new chapter houses.
These, in addition to the Kappa
Kappa Gamma and Phi Delta
Theta houses erected last year,
make Lasuen avenue a "Frater
nity Row." A private residence
has been built by Mr. Cooksey of
Menlo Park on a commanding emi
nence above the county road. Of
this Mr. Hodges was the architect.
In addition to these, several
minor changes have been made.
Architect Hodges has moved his
headquarters to the new postoflice
building, and the frame building
formerly occupied by him is now
leased by the Palace Pharmacy of
Palo Alto, and used as a drugstore.
The Faculty Clubhouse has also
been enlarged and improved.
