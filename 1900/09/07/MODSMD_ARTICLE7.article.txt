A new volume of the Daily Palo
Alto begins once more, and with it
the call of the editors for copy.
The-merits or defects of the paper
rest with its staff. Work on a col
lege daily is more or less labor of
love, and to him who is willing to
work much valuable experience may
be gained. Many of the Stanford
alumni who are at present holding
journalistic positions gained their
first newspaper knowledge as as
sistants on the staff of this paper.
There is a place for every one who
is willing to do what little is re
quired of him. Good, capable as
sistants are always in demand, and
their services will be appreciated
by the student body.
