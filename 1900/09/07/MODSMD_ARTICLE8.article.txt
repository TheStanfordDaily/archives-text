The early arrival of the coach
and his untiring efforts so early in
the season in behalf of football at
Stanford are hopeful portents for
the future. The coach is a born
enthusiast, and has already suc
ceeded in instilling some of this
same enthusiasm into all those who
have come into contact with him.
With an enthusiastic coach and a
united football squad to set the ex
ample, the student body this year
must catch this same spirit and give
the coach and team its entire sup
port. All feelings of animosity or
petty jealousy should be laid aside,
and we should work as a whole for
the triumph of the Cardinal. This
is the critical year in which the
Stanford spirit must assert itself, if
ever, and the student body must
show the coficli that it will be done
and that no obstacle will be thrown
in his path to prevent his efforts.
