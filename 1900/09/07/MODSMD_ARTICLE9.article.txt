The beginning of the college year
finds the University still making
large advances. The advent of a
large and strong Freshman class,
with the substantial and costly im
provements of the past year, and
promises of continued advancement
to come, is intensely gratifying to
every loyal Stanford student. We
cannot hut feel that the coming
year is one of great promise, and
that during it the University as a

whole will make great strides in
every direction. The incoming class
is to be congratulated on the fact
that it enters the University at a
time of great prosperity and un
equaled hopes for the future. The
Class of 1904 can always point with
pride to the fact that with it begins
the era of the Greater Stanford
University. The days of the pio
neer and its memories are nut for it.
To it belongs the beginnings of
Stanford's career of larger influence,
and it should enter into its duties
and take up the work of its pre
decessors with that eagerness that
has made the old Stanford spirit so
glorious.
