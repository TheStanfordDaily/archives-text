Last year the Inter-Society De
bating League announced a new
plan to arouse interest in debating
among the new students. This took
the shape of a debating society for
Freshmen especially during the first
semester. This plan if carried out
will undoubtedly do much to awak
en renewed interest in debating and
develop new material. There should
be no delay, and the first meeting
of the Freshman Class should be the
best opportunity of explaining the
plan in its detail and arousing the
interest of the new students. The
Debating League should work up
this matter very carefully, as it is
highly important that the new stu
dents be enthused on the subject of
debating. Debating interest has
until lately been on the decline at
Stanford, and this is a first step in
the right direction, which if followed
out cannot help but do much to
give debating a helpful impetus
that will go far to repeat the vic
tory of last year.
