Thk football management has
issued a call for all freshmen who
intend to play football tine reason
to see him at once. This is some
thing that should not be neglected,
and applies to all men, whether
they are new students or not. JNo

one who can play, whether he has
had the experience or not, should
wait to be asked. He should have
enough spirit for the honor of his
college to come out for practice
without being solicited or urged.
The management has not the time
to spend in persuasionâ€”football
candidates must go to the manager.
We are confident that in our coach
and captain we have everything to
be desired. They can do nothing,
however, without men to make up
the teams. There can never be too
many men out to practice. In the
past, the complaint has been made
that men who would have made
good players have come out to prac
tice and, receiving no attention
from the coach or captain, have felt
that they were not needed, and in
consequence have turned in their
suits, not caring to come out when
they had no chance to practice.
Now there should be some chance
to remedy this, if such conditions
exist, and we believe that it will be
done, as every man should be given
a fair opportunity to see what he
can do.
