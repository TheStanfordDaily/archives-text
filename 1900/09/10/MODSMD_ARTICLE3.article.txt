# Law Library Improvements.
## 
### 
In addition to the changes
about the campus already noted by
the Daily Palo Alto, the interior
of the old library building has un
dergone extensive alterations dur
ing the summer, with the result
that the Law Department findsitself
this semester in quarters sump
tions beyond recognition after the
cramped and crowded quarters of
other years. The old stack room is
now divided into five apartments,
three of them offices for the faculty
and two of them lecture rooms
which will accomodate 160 stu
dents. The library has received
several invoices of books since last
semester, and was also the recipi
ent of the valuable collection of
volumes belonging to the late U. S.
Justice Field. The list of new
books includes Federal and Circuit
Reports, especially those of the Pa
cific Slope, which are particularly
useful to western law students.
The library assistants are J. T.
Burciiam, '97, and G. T. Cochran,
'01.
