# FIRST SUNDAY SERMON.
## Dr. C.R. Brown Talks on "The Right Method in Religion." 
### 
The first sermon of the college
year was delivered in the chapel
Sunday morning by Dr. Charles R.
Brown, pastor of the First Congre
gational Church of Oakland, and
lecturer in the department of Phi
losophy. The speaker said:
"There are those in every com
munity who dive into religion head
first instead of heart first. They
try to begin in the middle of a
Christian career instead of starting
at the beginning. No one begins
life as a man six feet tall and
twenty-one years of age, but as a
child. Jesus did not begin life as a
man, but as a babe, and had to
learn all that he knew gradually.
The Jews at one time asked, 'How
knows this man these things?' He
said that he learned these things
not of books but by experience.
His judgment was just because he
did the will of Him who sent him.
"The right habits are building in
the man a habitation for Chris
tianity. The day is now gone by
when any pope, priest, potentate,
or ecclesiastical body can hand
down any decision that will be ac
cepted by mankind as a Christian
authority. Man must decide the
things by what moral judgment he
has gained by actual experience.
He cannot depend upon others, but
he must have assurance from with
in himself.
"If men could be free from all
strife and bend all their energies to
do the will of God, a great light
would burst upon mankind, and
raise them in the grace of God. The
man with a good moral conscience
will be the man placed first in God's
estimation. It will not be by a
great mind so much as by a pure
conscience, that man will grow in
God's light.
" It is absurd for a man to stand
aside until he understands the the
ory of religion. The growing babe
does not understand the physiolog
ical or hygienic reason for taking
proper food and restful sleep ; yet
its mother does, and did before
even there was such a thing as
science.
A memorial church is being
built here. I like the place where
it is being erected, it is right
here where your daily work is car
ried on, and not far removed, as
is too often the case with many uni
versities. It is joined hard on to
walls inside of which science is being
pursued. Inside the chemistry
laboratory truths are constantly
being proven, and not a truth
proven here will conflict with a
truth brought forth behind the
stained windows of the church
which is joined to its walls. Scien
tists never refuse to grasp new
things until they understand the
materials they meet. They go into
the laboratories and experiment
with the unknown substances until
they are satisfied of their composi
tion. The same is true of religion.
Man should not hesitate because he
does not understand the theory of
religion, but lie should experiment
with it and he will be convinced of
its real power.
" 1 do not care anything about

the arguments, which we often see,
concerning the presence of God.
They do not concern nie personally.
Of course they are interesting to
read, but Jdo not need them. The
same is true of the arguments set
forth in favor of the value of
prayer. One only needs to pray
faithfully, and to receive the whole
soul blessing to be assured of its
value. All the fine arguments are
as dry leaves to this feeling of con
tent and peace.
" 1 do feel as confident that I
shall live after this life as that 1
shall live after this sermon, and
yet I have no proof that I can
force upon you except the assur
ance which comes from constant
prayer and the living of an upright
life.
"In the fall of 1862, which was a
time of great uncertainty, there was
a falling away of feeling toward the
Administration. States which two
years before had gone Republican
now went Democratic. Wendell
Phillips and a few other radical
agitators held that the Administra
tion was too slow in dealing with
slavery. Another party, composed
chiefly of War Democrats, took the
opposite stand, and complained
that the Administration was med
dling too much with slavery, and
was not paying enough attention to
affairs pertaining to the saving of
the nation. At this time a delega
tion of ministers from Ohio went to
Abraham Lincoln and laid before
him a plan for carrying on the
Government which they claimed
was right, ae it- had been revealed
to them by God after much prayer.
The President listened to them re
spectfully, and then, in a quiet
way, suggested to them that prob
ably God, if he had any special
manner of carrying on the war,
would have let the head of the na
tion know of it. This great God
fearing man listened to all argu
ments from all sides,and then went
on in his own way and saved the
Union.
" Bring all your claims to the
bar of God,and lie not hasty to cast
any aside, as you will find that the
truths which will do you good are
not those which you have read from
a book, but those which you have
somehow gained by a trustful and
faithful serving of God."

"The right habits are building in
the man a habitation for Chris
tianity. The day is now gone by
when any pope, priest, potentate,
or ecclesiastical body can hand
down any decision that will be ac
cepted by mankind as a Christian
authority. Man must decide the
things by what moral judgment he
has gained by actual experience.
He cannot depend upon others, but
he must have assurance from with
in himself.
"If men could be free from all
strife and bend all their energies to
do the will of God, a great light
would burst upon mankind, and
raise them in the grace of God. The
man with a good moral conscience
will be the man placed first in God's
estimation. It will not be by a
great mind so much as by a pure
conscience, that man will grow in
God's light.
" It is absurd for a man to stand
aside until he understands the the
ory of religion. The growing babe
does not understand the physiolog
ical or hygienic reason for taking
proper food and restful sleep ; yet
its mother does, and did before
even there was such a thing as
science.
A memorial church is being
built here. I like the place where
it is being erected, it is right
here where your daily work is car
ried on, and not far removed, as
is too often the case with many uni
versities. It is joined hard on to
walls inside of which science is being
pursued. Inside the chemistry
laboratory truths are constantly
being proven, and not a truth
proven here will conflict with a
truth brought forth behind the
stained windows of the church
which is joined to its walls. Scien
tists never refuse to grasp new
things until they understand the
materials they meet. They go into
the laboratories and experiment
with the unknown substances until
they are satisfied of their composi
tion. The same is true of religion.
Man should not hesitate because he
does not understand the theory of
religion, but lie should experiment
with it and he will be convinced of
its real power.
" 1 do not care anything about

the arguments, which we often see,
concerning the presence of God.
They do not concern nie personally.
Of course they are interesting to
read, but Jdo not need them. The
same is true of the arguments set
forth in favor of the value of
prayer. One only needs to pray
faithfully, and to receive the whole
soul blessing to be assured of its
value. All the fine arguments are
as dry leaves to this feeling of con
tent and peace.
" 1 do feel as confident that I
shall live after this life as that 1
shall live after this sermon, and
yet I have no proof that I can
force upon you except the assur
ance which comes from constant
prayer and the living of an upright
life.
"In the fall of 1862, which was a
time of great uncertainty, there was
a falling away of feeling toward the
Administration. States which two
years before had gone Republican
now went Democratic. Wendell
Phillips and a few other radical
agitators held that the Administra
tion was too slow in dealing with
slavery. Another party, composed
chiefly of War Democrats, took the
opposite stand, and complained
that the Administration was med
dling too much with slavery, and
was not paying enough attention to
affairs pertaining to the saving of
the nation. At this time a delega
tion of ministers from Ohio went to
Abraham Lincoln and laid before
him a plan for carrying on the
Government which they claimed
was right, ae it- had been revealed
to them by God after much prayer.
The President listened to them re
spectfully, and then, in a quiet
way, suggested to them that prob
ably God, if he had any special
manner of carrying on the war,
would have let the head of the na
tion know of it. This great God
fearing man listened to all argu
ments from all sides,and then went
on in his own way and saved the
Union.
" Bring all your claims to the
bar of God,and lie not hasty to cast
any aside, as you will find that the
truths which will do you good are
not those which you have read from
a book, but those which you have
somehow gained by a trustful and
faithful serving of God."
