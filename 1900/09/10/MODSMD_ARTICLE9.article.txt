The announcements calling for
meetings looking to the organiza
tion of political clubs here at Stan
ford should receive hearty support.
Every one who can should attend
the meetings of bis party club and
attiliate himself with it by signing
its membership roll. The political
clubs in election years have always
filled an important place in student
affairs, and they should not be less
important this year than before.
University students always take an
active interest in political affairs,
and it is important that they should,
for from the educated classes of the
community must come the move
ment for political reform. Large
and enthusiastic political clubs can
do much to keep interest, aroused
in the issues now before the people,
and no one should hesitate to enroll
himself as a member.
