# NEW CUSTOM INAUGURATED.
## Men of the University Gather on Encina Steps and Sing College Songs. 
### 
A new plan for college enthusi
asni was started last evening when
some of the men of the University
gathered on the Encina steps for
the purpose of singing college songs.
Early in the evening a meeting was
held at the Zeta Psi house at
which plans were discussed for
gatherings similar to those held at
Princeton, Williams, and other
Eastern colleges, where the men
get together for an hour of singing.
The idea was proposed by Chas.
K. Field, '95, who has for some
time been planning to strengthen
the college singing. He explained
the customs which are in force in
the Eastern colleges, and urged
that something be done to start the
custom here. It was decided to
meet about one evening each week
on the steps of Encina for the pur
pose of singing the college songs.
The singing will be led by the Uni
versity (jilee Club. These gather
ings will take the place of the ath
letic rallies which have been held
in the past. None but the men of
the University will be allowed to
join in these gatherings, as it was
thought this was the only way to
make them successful.
The first meeting was held last
night just after the lights went out,
in Encina. A number of men had
been called to the Hall by the re
port that a rush was to occur be
tween the two lower classes, but as
the disturbance quieted down Field
was called for and brought the
matter up. About three hundred
men were present and they all took
up the idea enthusiastically. Af
ter they were seated on the steps
Charlie Field was called upon to
lead. A new adaptation of "Hail
Stanford Hail" was sung and af
terwards "One, Two, Three, Four,"
"Here's to Stanford College," and
several familiar football songs.
The enthusiasm of the meeting
last night was beyond what was
expected, and those who have been
instrumental in inaugurating the
custom feel confident of success in
carrying it out.
Following is a copy of the new
song "Hail, Alma Mater"; the
words and music will be printed
later so that every one may learn
it before the next meeting:
Hail, Alma Mater!
(Adapted from 'â€¢ Hail, Stanford, Hail!" by
C. K. Field.)
Where thy fair quadrangles spread
Tow'nl tin! hills above thee,
Cool arcades and roofs of red,
Here come we who love thee.
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater!
Chorus:
Hail to thee our song shall be.
Loyal praise
All our days,
In lives that speak of thee.
I la.il, Stanford, I fail!
As thy Tree, untouched by time,
Lifts its head to heaven,
So resistless growth is thine,
From the ground here given.
Proud we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater!
Thou dost, give uh golden days,
Joy and friendship bringing,
Though we part, by many ways,
To thy memories clinging,
We will kct'p together, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater!

We will tight for thee today,
Fight with blood-red o'er ns,
Till the Stanford spirit lay
Every foe before us,
All thy sons triumphant, hailing
Thee, our alma mater!
