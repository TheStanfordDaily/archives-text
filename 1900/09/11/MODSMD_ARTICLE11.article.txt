The large per cent of student
body assessments collected this year
by the treasurer is a cause for con
gratulation, us showing the in
creased interest in the student body
' welfare. Time was when it was
considered the mark of special keen
ness not to pay the student body
dues, and many were the boasts by
old students that they had never
paid a student body assessment in
their whole college career. How
ever, things have changed; students
have come to realize that in paying
their annual dues they are only
helping out the student body, and
paying their share of the expense
of putting a winning aggregation
of athletes in the field. Every as
sessment collected is applied direct
ly to the running expenses of the
student body, and in a time of fi
nancial shortage like the beginning
of this season every assessment
counts. We are running our ath
letics each year at a greater ex
pense, which is as it should be, and
consequently more money is needed.
Football is the only sport so far
that gives large returns, and the
students are obliged to pay for the
other branches of athletics out of
the money received from football.
If every student paid his assess
ment, the money received would
give a better impetus at the open
ing of the athletic season. Every
one who has paid his assessment is
to be congratulated on his college
spirit, and it is to be hoped that
the sentiment of paying assess
ments will continue to increase un
til there remains no one who does
not pay them.
