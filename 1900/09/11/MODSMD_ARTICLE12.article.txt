A number of the men of the
University having inaugurated the
custom of singing on the Encina
steps, there remains only for those
interested the duty —the pleasure—
of carrying the idea to its fullest
extent. Stanford has a great many

good songs and it) getting more all
the time. And, for enthusiasm,
there is no such potent factor as
good singing. It is something that
all can enter into; something that
unifies sentiment, for that very rea
son. In the Eastern colleges this
idea of singing is carried out sys
tematically, and the college "sings"
are regular features of undergradu
ate life. At Princeton especially is
this true, and on the occasion of
commencement when, with the
"Steps Song," the outgoing class
delivers over the sovereignty of the
steps of Nassau Hall to the succeed
ing class, there is no more truly
sincere moment in the college life
of all those present. Perhaps we
may be long in developing such
customs, but we can at least have
the singing, the good fellowship,
and the inspiration of our regard
for Alma Mater. In respect to this
singing, we naturally look to the
members of the Glee Club to lead
the choruses, and to add that confi
dence that the untrained singers
lack. They would endear them
selves to the student body much
more in this wise than by any
number of tours, and if they made
a practice of using the college songs
that all of us know, when they are
on these tours, such as our new
"One, Two, Three, Four!" "Hail,
Stanford, Hail!" "Sing a Song of
Colleges," and some good verses to
the "Son of a Gambolier," they
would more clearly represent the
undergraduate spirit —that strange
mixture of rollicking devil-may
care and real sentiment —than they
do with what may be styled a
higher class of music. More than
all, if they help on the bleachers at
practice, and in singing on all oc
casions where the students gather,
they will really do a bigger work
for the college than the Christmas
trip amounts to, and would more
truly deserve the title of "Varsity
Glee Club." At any rate, whatever
means we employ for such singing,
let lis have it by all odds, as a
most potent factor in our student
life.
