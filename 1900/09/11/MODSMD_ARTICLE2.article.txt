# Football Affairs.

### 
The football outlook at present is
all that could be desired in many
ways, and coach and captain are
feeling particularly gratified at the
general trend of football affairs.
Coach Yost, when seen this after
noon, said that he was very well
pleased with everything so far. He
says that without exception he
never saw a squad which was as
willing to work or had any better
spirit than the one which is now in
his charge.
The Varsity men are working
hard and give promise of some ex
cellent results, and, if things con
tinue as they are now, Mr. Yost
predicts that some very satisfactory
work will be done in the preliminary
games. The old men have good
spirit, and take hold with a willing
ness and energy that sets a good
example to the new men, and can
not help but culminate in enthusing
the entire student body. While
the conditions are satisfactory at
this early date, yet that does not
mean that the squad does not need
training, and plenty of it, for only
by the most conscientious effort can
we hope to put out a team that will
be able to play the game that must
be expected of it.
The .only disappointing feature
of the beginning of the season is
the very small number of freshmen
who turn out to practice. There is
plenty of material in 1904, and why
it should not appear on the field is
a mystery. The freshmen who play
football at all should by all means
turn out, and those who have not
played should take advantage of
this opportunity to see what they
Can do for their class and the Uni
versity.
The practice so far has consisted
in exer<*ises in handling the ball
and light' running and punting.
Coach Yost's idea is to break the
men in gradually, and get them in
condition before giving them any
hard training, as his plan is to get
the man in shape first, then teach
him the game.
There will be a meeting of all
football men Friday night in En
cina lobby for the purpose of sign
ing for positions and talking over
the season's prospects.
