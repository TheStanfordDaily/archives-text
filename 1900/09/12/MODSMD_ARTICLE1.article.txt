# FRESHMAN DEBATING SOCIETY.
## The 						Debating League's New Plan to Arouse Interest in Debating. 
### 
Owing to a feeling which pre
vailed that the system of debating
societies in the University was not
best calculated to develop debating
talent, action was taken at the close
of last semester providing for a rad
ical change in the present society
system. A defect of the present
system is that comparatively few
Freshmen interest themselves in de
bating. Too many new students
who might develop into good de
baters if they began the work early
in their college career are deterred
from seeking admission to a debat
ing society because of a lack of
previous experience. Lack of ac
quaintanceship with other students
also operates to make Freshmen
slow to enter a debating organiza
tion.
For the purpose of bringing out
new debating material as early as
possible, the Inter-Society Debating
League provided last May for the
formation of a Freshman debating
society. To this organization all
Freshmen, women as well as men,
will be admitted on presentation of
their names.
For the purpose of stimulating
interest in the work among the
members of the new class, it is pro
vided that the Freshmen represen
tatives in the Freshman-Sopho
more debate shall be chosen from
the Freshman society. The time
for holding this debate has been
changed from the latter part of the
first semester to some period in the
second semester between the Easter
vacation and the date of the Inter-
Collegiate Debate. The possibility
of gaining a victory in the Inter-
Class Debate will lie the stimulus
which will draw the new students
together and weld them in a strong,
aggressive debating organization.
In order to give the widest scope
for the new debating society, the
Debating League has provided that
none of the older societies shall ad
mit Freshmen until after the date
of the Inter-Class Debate. This
event shall mark the end of the
new society, and the members may
then seek admission into any of
the various debating societies.
The work of establishing the new
debating society is in the hands of
tlie executive committee of the
Debating League. The officers of
the League for the present year are:
President, J. F. English,'ol; vice
president, W. A. Morris,'ol; secre
tary and treasurer, M. C. Decarli,
'01.
An attempt will be made to in
terest the Freshman Class in this
project at the class meeting to
morrow.
