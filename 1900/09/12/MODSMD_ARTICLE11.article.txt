# The 						"Chaparral."
## 
### 
The first paper to make its ap
pearance this year was the Chapar
ral, much improved and enlarged
from last year, and evidently on
a sound basis from the financial
standpoint, judging by the number
of advertisements. Typographic
ally it is ahead of any publication
ever issued here and is a great
credit to the taste of the editor and
to the handicraft of the printers,
the Stanley, Taylor Co. of San
Francisco. From cover to cover
it is a succession of good humor
and brightness. While some of
the jokes are not all that they
should be, there is enough excel
lence to carry all. The art work
is the distinctive feature, from the
striking cover design to the last
drawing by Culver, whose work
has lately had such a vogue in
Life. The editorials, especially the
third, are keen and incisive. If it
keeps up the standard set by this
first issue, it will be a credit to the
college and ably fill a place that
has been long vacant. It is is pub
lished under the auspices of the
Stanford Press Club, the manage
ment being in the hands of Bristow
Adams, '01, editor-in-chief, 11. E.
Renaud, '03, art editor, and Nor
man 11. Davis, '02, business mana
ger.
