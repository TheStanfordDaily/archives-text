# TUESDAY EVENING LECTURE.
## Dr. Flugel Delivers the First Lecture of the Year, on "University Ideals." 
### 
Dr. Fliigel gave the first of the
regular Tuesday evening lectures
in the chapel last night. His
theme was "University Ideals,"
and he spoke as follows:
"I will treat of the German uni
versity under three heads; first
of the work pursued, second of
the professor, and third of the stu
dent. Of course these three heads
are so joined and interwoven that
one cannot he described without
bringing in one of the others, hut
I will take them up in the order
named. In Germany the semi
nary is the highest grade of uni
versity work. It is designed for
mature students who attend it in
order to come in close touch with
the master's ideas and methods.
We are shocked to see seminary
methods used in high schools, and
even in the freshman and sopho
more classes in college. Training
of the critical powers is the great
est aim in seminary work.
"Next in importance of the work
is the lecture. Lectures are di
vided into two classes, public and
private. Public lectures are free
and are delivered to large numbers,
while the private lectures are paid
for and are given to comparatively
few. A feature of the lecture is
the entire absence of all school
room features. No roll is called,
as the professor would sooner
speak to empty benches than to
those who attend through com
pulsion.
"The German professor does not
spend as much time with his classes
as does the American professor.
His university work does not often
exceed eight hours a week in both
lectures and seminary, and as the
university year lasts only twenty
two weeks, his work seems light.
Even if many reproaches are cast
at a German professor, it cannot be
said that he is lazy. His vacation
is his busiest time. It is then that
he prepares all his lectures for the
following year, and should a new
course be assigned him, he then
gathers his notes together and ar
ranges them that he may not be
hindered when the work shall com
mence.
"Allow me to speak of an old
ideal of a German professor, the
professor of twenty years ago. He
is a man of eminence, high per
sonal character, of unselfish devo
tion to duty, often rejecting civic
honors, and withal absent-minded.
"Every serious question of na
tional importance is worked out by
him or under his influence. He is
much removed from his students
and often appears even to be gruff.
The distance between the student
and the professor has, I will admit,
two sides, but the advantages are,
1 believe, greater than the disad
vantages. Personally, I have not
enjoyed anything more, here at
Stanford University, than the asso
ciation with the students; but the
graduate students would reap more
benefit if the professor remained
more to himself, that he might put
more concentrated effort into his
work.

"A university which reaches the
highest branches of science should
give instruction in a scientific way,
and should have the highest aca
demic freedom. Viewed from an
historical standpoint, the American
university labors under the evils of
mediaeval methods, yet 1 see no
reason why it should not have the
brightest future, as America is the
heir to all nations of the world.
Let her take the virtues of these
nations and not the vices, and good
will result."
