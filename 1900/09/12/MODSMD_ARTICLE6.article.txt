# Vacations Spent Abroad.
## 
### 
The present year h:ts brought
about the customary changes in the
faculty due to the absence of sev
eral who have been granted their
sabbatical vacations. The places
of the absent ones will for the
greater part be taken by other
members of the department who
have returned from abroad to re
sume their work.
Professor David E. Spencer re
turns after a year's study to relieve
Professor Show in the History de
par tjnent. Professor Spencer was
one of the members of the small
Stanford colony at Leipsic, which
was composed of Professor Frank
Angell of the Psychology depart
ment, Professor S. \V.Young, Chem
istry, and several Stanford stu
dents. Professors Angell and
Young have both returned to the
University, where they will carry
on their former work.
Professor James Owen Griffin
spent the greater part of his vaca
tion in Germany after a short visit
in England. He made a careful
study of the German methods of
teaching, and visited most of the
larger German universities.
Professor M. B. Anderson resumes
his position at the head of the
English department, after an ab
sence of nine months. Most of his
time was spent in Italy, with the
exception of a short stay in Paris,
where he visited the exposition in
the company of Professor Davidson
of the French department, and
Dane Coolidge, '98.
The Engineering department will
be deprived of the service of Pro
fessor A. YY 7 . Smith for the coming
year. His work will be carried on
by E. E. Farmer, who has spent
the past two years in study at
Paris.
Professor Campbell, Botany, and
Professor Murray, Greek, have also
returned from abroad, where their
mission was more one of rest and
recreation than of work.
Professor Davidson, who has but
recently accepted the position as
head of the department of Romanic
languages in the University of
Cincinnati, spent a portion of the
summer at Leipsic, where he re
ceived his Doctor's degree. Peter
Le Fort, formerly instructor in
French at Hoitt's School, has been
made an assistant in the French
department, but as yet no one has
been appointed to fill the vacancy
caused by Professor Davidson's de
parture.
