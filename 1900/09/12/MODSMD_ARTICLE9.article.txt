The action of the Executive Com
mittee in proposing an amendment
to the constitution of the Associated
Students, in regard to who may
vote at student body elections, seems
at first glance to be rather dictato
rial in that it might be depriving
students of the privilege of voting
who are really unable to pay their
student body assessment. However,
the percentage of students who can
not afford to pay the very slight
assessment of a dollar a year is so
small as to be practically insignifi
cant. That is not the class against
whom such an amendment is aimed;
it is against those who have so lit
tle spirit for the University welfare
that they will not pay. A great
many of those who never pay their
assessment do not even vote or at
tend student body meetings unless
they are especially urged. Those
who are foremost in the world of
college life, and who are interested
in the welfare of the student body,
are the ones who pay their assess
ments, so that there can be no hard
ship on them. The amendment
should have the desired effect of in
creasing the number of assessments
collected and still keep no one from
voting.
