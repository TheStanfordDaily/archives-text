# DEATH OF BARBARA JORDAN.
## Dr. Jordan's Little Daughter Passed Away Last Night After a Short Illness. 
### 
Little Barbara Jordan, the young
est child of Dr. and Mrs. Jordan,
died about midnight last night at
the family home. The announce
ment comes as a shock to the col
lege community, for though it was
generally known that she was ill,
no one feared that the illness would
result fatally.
Mrs. Jordan,Knight,and Barbara
spent the summer months camping
with friends in the mountains near
Santa Barbara, and it was while
there that the little one was taken
ill with a light attack of scarlet
fever. She recovered in a short
time, however, and was apparently
as well as ever. Mrs. Jordan, fear
ing that Knight would be taken
with the same disease, returned
home with him, leaving Barbara in
care of Miss Barlow, the governess,
who has been with the family for
years. When the child was ready
to travel, Miss Barlow brought her
home, reaching the campus a week
ago last Saturday. The change
from the warm climate of Santa
Barbara to the cooler climate of
Palo Alto caused the little one to
take cold, which brought on a com
plication of diseases. A consulta
tion of physicians was held and
everything done to relieve the
child's suffering, and until two days
ago she was thought to be improv
ing. A change for the worse came
then, and the child sank rapidly.
Early last evening she was taken
with convulsions, and was uncon
scious from then until about mid
night, when the end came.
Barbara Jordan was one of the
merriest and happiest of little wom
en, and every one who knew her grew
to love her. She had many friends
among the students and the mem
bers of the faculty, who will all
miss the little maid who had en
deared herself to so many.
No arrangements have as vet
been made for the funeral. Dr.
Jordan, who has been in Japan for
tlie past three months, will arrive
tomorrow on the "Nippon Maru."
Dr. Stillman went up to San Fran
cisco this afternoon to meet him.
