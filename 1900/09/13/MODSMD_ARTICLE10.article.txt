With the opening of the football
season comes seeming lack of inter
est on the part of the freshmen,
which is discouraging to the coach,
as well as to those of the student
body who are interested in bringing
out a strong Freshman eleven.
Coach Yost has been the first to ap
pear for work, but has been unable
to get enough material from the in
coming class to begin any practice,
although he has gone so far as to
make a personal canvass of mem
bers of the class. When (he coach
is taking such an interest as Mr.
Yost has shown, all that remains
to be done rests with the class it
self. Only a few members of the
class are able to play football, but
it rests with the other members to
see that all who can will appear for
practice. It is not only the success
of the present intercollegiate game
which is to be considered, but that
future Varsities are to come from
the present Freshman Class, and
the practice which these men gain
now will go to make a thorough
Varsity of the future.The Class of
1903 responded to the call last year
and the result was a victory over
their Berkeley rivals. It remains
for the Class of 1904 to equal this
victory, and to accomplish this the
men must come out at once for
practice.
