hung up for the races aggregate
$8,000. It is intended to hold races,
both running and trotting, every
afternoon during the week, in which
some of the fastest horses in the
State will compete.
One of the principal features
of the week will be a polo game be
tween teams from the Country

very exciting as the teams will in
clude some of the best players and
polo ponies on the Coast. One
day in the week will be Spanish
day and will be given over to the
old-fashioned Spanish sports, in
cluding a barbecue and an up-to
date bull-fight.
