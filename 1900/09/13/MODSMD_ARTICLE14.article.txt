# The 						"Sequoia."

### 
Number one of volume ten of
the Stanford Sequoia came out to
day. The cover design by Remind,
'03, is an improvement on that of
last year and the general appear
ance of the whole magazine is bet
ter. Two full-page half-tones add
much to its attractiveness and if
more are used in subsequent issues
there will undoubtedly be an in
creased demand by subscribers, as
no one will be content to read a
copy and pass it on, but all will
want a complete volume to recall
past scenes and f;tces in college lite.
The stories are up to the stan
dard, and after the hurry of getting
settled is over and the literary men
and women of the University have
more time for writing, we may ex
pect a literary magazine which will
be up to the standard set by any of
the big colleges.
