# NEW FRATERNITY HOMES.
## Work on the Buildings Adds Much to the Beauty of Lasuen Row. 
### 
A new era in the fraternity life
iit Stanford was entered upon dur
ing the past summer, when four of
the local chapters, Alpha Phi,
Delta Gamma, Chi Psi, and Kappa
Alpha Theta, began the erection
of permanent homes. With the
exception of the Chi Psi house, all
are situated on Lasuen Row, where
houses are already either owned or
occupied by Beta Theta Pi, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Zeta Psi, and Phi
Delta Theta. This row, which has
become better known as "Fratern
ity Row," is now one of the chief
objects of interest to visitors at the
University because of the different
styles of architecture and the pic
turesque effect which the new
homes make.
The first house for which ground
was broken was the Alpha Phi,
which is situated near the southern
end of Lasuen Row, facing the hills.
The building is planned on the
quaint Spanish style, and with its
shingle walls and rustic columns
presents an exceedingly pretty ef
fect. The same style of architecture
is carried out in the interior of the
building, the rooms being large,
with low ceilings and high wains
coting. The lower floor is so ar
ranged that reception hall, library,
parlors and drawing-room can be
-thrown into one. The second floor
contains ten sleeping rooms, and
the upper floor is ihe chapter room
of the fraternity.
A broad veranda extends across
the front and south side of the
building, with the arched effect
following out the prevailing style
of architecture.
The Delta Gamma lodge is built
on Lastion Row between the Phi
Delta Tneta house and the Kappa
Kappa (liitria house, both of which
were buili. last year. The architec
ture of the building is of the Moor
ish type, and the effect on the
whole is imposing and massive.
The building is two stories and a
half, with a broad veranda across
the front, leading to a porte cocher
on the south side. The first floor
contains parlors, reception room,
dining-room and library, and is ad
mirably arranged for entertaining,
the rooms all being connected by
wide archways. On the second
floor are eight sleeping rooms, and
on the third floor is space enough
for four more rooms which are to
be finished later on. Wolf and
McKenzie of San Jose are the
architects.
Another fraternity house now
being built on the campus is the
Chi Psi lodge on Salvatierra Row.
The Spanish style of architecture
will be followed in the exterior con
struction of the building, giving
much the effect of the Spanish mis
sions. The building will be three
story, and will cost about $7,000.
The lower floor contains the usual
reception rooms, and the upper
floors the sleeping rooms.
The last house to be commenced
this year is the lodge which the
Kuppa Alpha Thetas are now build
ing on Lasuen Row, north of the
Alpha Phi house. Thorp and Len
zen are the architects. The house

will comfortably accommodate
about twenty people. The lower
rooms, including library, parlor,
and reception halls, will be conven
iently arranged for dancing and
other forms of entertaining. The
house is to be finished by the first
of November and will be immedi
ately occupied by the members of
the Sorority, who have temporarily
reserved rooms in Koble Hall.
