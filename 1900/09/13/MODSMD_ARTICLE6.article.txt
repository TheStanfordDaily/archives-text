The Athletic Committee met yes
terday afternoon in room 11 quad.
Those present were Marrack, '01;
Morris, '01; Cantwell, '01; Sy
monds, '01; Uildersleeve, '02; Nar
ramore,'o3; Stuart, '01; Lanagan,
00; Perkins, '01. Absent: Miss
E. Mc Fad den, '01; S. P. Hardy, '02;
YV. li. Hamilton, '02; H. J. Ed
wards, '02, and VV. \V. Burnett,'ol.
Upon motion J. B. Gildersleeve,
'02, was elected Freshman football
manager. This was done to do
away with the conflict of schedules
which has been the result of two
managers in former years. The
selection by Manager Gildersleeve
of N. H. Davis, '02, as assistant
football manager was approved.
C. A. Cantwell, '01, 1). E. Brown,
'97, and F. L. Berry, '99, were
elected members of the intercollegi
ate athletic committee.
The action of several students of
the University taking part in the
baseball series in the North during
the summer was brought up and
discussed. Upon the explanation
that the responsibility for adver
tising the team as a Stanford team
was with the northern managers
and newspapers, and not with those
who went from the University, it
was decided to drop the matter.
The penalty for this offense is the
loss of the Varsity emblem, and as
some of last year's Varsity were
with the team mentioned, it fell to
the Athletic Committee to investi
gate the charges.
The vacancy in the committee
caused by the absence from college
of C. E. McFadden, '03, will be
filled at the next meeting of the Ex
ecutive Committee.
