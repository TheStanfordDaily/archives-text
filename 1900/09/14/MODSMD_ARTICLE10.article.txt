The accident that happened on
the football field last night would
never have occurred if the students
who watch the practice would stay
on the bleachers, where they he
long, instead of crowding on the
fiald and getting into the way of
the players. When the gridiron
was located on the baseball field, it
had to be roped off to keep specta
tors off of it. However, on the new
grounds ropes were deemed hardly
necessary, as the track that sur
rounds it and the large bleachers
afford sufficient room for all who
may wish to watch the practice.
There is plenty of room, and the
spectators should keep their proper
places. Of course football practice
is very exciting, and our enthusi
asts are all eager to watch every
play that is made, but when they
do so at the risk of injury to play
ers, it is time that a halt was called.
The spectators must keep off the
field. On the bleachers one can sit
comfortably and at the same time
watch the whole practice much
better than on the ground, espec
ially when there are three teams at
practice, as is the case at present.
With a large squad of men at prac
tice, there is no room on the field
for any besides the coaches and
players. The spectators should be
aware of Ibis and keep where they
properly belong, and not interfere
with the movements of the squad.
If they do not, (here is a certainty
that accidents will be of common
occurrence, as the players cannot
run through the crowd without
some one being injured, and per
haps very seriously. The specta
tors should be warned by last
night's occurrence and keep off the
field in future.
