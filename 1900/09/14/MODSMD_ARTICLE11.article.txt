The treasurkk of the student
body proposes to sell combination
tickets this year, which will admit
students to all campus athletic

games. We think that it would he
a good plan to increase the benefits
of these tickets hy admitting pos
sessors of them to all athletic con
tests in which teams from this
University take part. The far
reaching effects of such a policy
cannot be overestimated. It seems
to us that from it we would derive
an enlarged, and hence more bene
ficial, body of athletic supporters.
Hardly a student is willing to miss
the Thanksgiving game, but the
attendance at the preliminary
games, especially those played in
San Francisco, is invariably very
poor. The combination ticket will
certainly gain much support for
our team in these games, and there
by greatly encourage the players.
In addition to this, it will broaden
our athletic sympathies. Men who
are interested in football are often
uninterested in baseball and track
events, but the mere possession of
a ticket to games will be an in
ducement to attend them, and at
tendance, after all, goes far to
arouse the enthusiasm which it is
the effort of all those interested in
athletics to stimulate. We are en
tering into a period of athletic re
juvenation. and the combination
ticket will be a great aid in this
direction.
