# On the Gridiron.

The week's work in football, while
necessarily of a nature not calcu
lated to appeal to the bleachers, lias
been very satisfactory and profit
able. The practice has consisted
entirely of handling the ball, punt
ing, and light running, all funda
mental and important elements of
the season's work, in that they get
the men in a condition for the
harder practice ahead of them.
Already the men are showing
marked improvement in every way,
and increased endurance and accu
racy show the wisdom of the course
which Coach Yost has adopted.
Manager Gildersleeve reports that
sixty suits have been issued lo date,
a large number, # considering the
earliness of the season. With sixty
men on the held every afternoon
there can be no doubt that the
student body is as a whole taking
great interest in football, and that
the efforts of the manager and coach
are not unappreciated. As yet,
however, the number of people on
the bleachers is very small in pro
portion to the number on the grid
iron. ' That this is so is much to be
regretted, as the men need encour
agement more in the uninteresting
and unexciting stnges of the practice
than they do when there is the
nightly line up to stimulate them
to greater efforts.
The first accident of any im
portance so far this season occurred
last night, when J. T. Nourse, '00,
and U.S. Fisher, '02, collided while
running. Both men are suffering
from swollen faces as a result, and
consider themselves fortunate to
have escaped more serious injury.
