# Expression of Sorrow.
## 
### 
The following expression of sym
pathy was adopted at a special meet
ing of the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students this after
noon :
"The Executive Committee begs
leave to express the grief of Stan
ford students for tlie sorrow which

has fallen upon the family of our
President.
<I No formal resolutions can give
fitting expression to the sympathy
resulting from the personal intima
cy which existed between little
Barbara and many of the students.
No written words can intimate how
we shall miss the maid of whom
we shall always treasure the pic
ture given us by her father.
" 'Little lady, cease your play
For a moment, if you may.
All I ask is, silently
Turn your mother's eyes on me.'"
