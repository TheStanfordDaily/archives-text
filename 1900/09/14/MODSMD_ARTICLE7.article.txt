# Freshman Debaters Meet.
## 
### 
The Fresh mail debaters held
their first meeting in the chapel
today at 1:30. The meeting was
called to order by J. F. English,
'01. He first briefly explained
that the object of the society was
to encourage Freshman debaters,
and to give them practice for the
Sophomore-Freshman debate. He
further said that all the debating
societies had agreed to admit no
Freshman to their ranks until
after the interclass debate, so that
it would be imperative for any one
wishing to practice in debating to
join the Freshman society. More
over, it is rumored that the team to
go against the Sophomores will be
chosen entirely from the society.
After a brief discussion it was
decided to appoint a committee of
three to draw up a suitable consti
tution. The committee consists of
Chandler, '04, chairman, Thomas,
'04, and Anderson, '04.
Nominations of oflicers were then
made as follows: President, King
ery, '04, Rockey; vice-president,
Edwards, '04; secretary, Chandler,
'04; Treasurer, Bower, '04.
English next, read a rough draft
of a constitution which he advised
the committee to use as a model.
The next meeting was set for
Wednesday, September 19th, at
1:30 p.m., but as the chapel is in
use then it will have to be post
poned until 4:30 of the same date.
