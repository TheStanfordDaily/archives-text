## Varsity Schedule Completed.—Season Tickets for Campus Games. Eighty-five Men Sign. 
### 
The football management has
completed the schedule for the sea
son, and it is published below as
prepared. There may be some ad
ditional games, and there is always
a possibility of a withdrawal, but
as far as is now known the regular
program will be as follows:
VARSITY SCHEDULE.
September 28, Stanford vs. Reli
ance, campus.
October G—Stanford vs. Santa
Clara, campus.
October 11 —Stanford vs. San
Jose Normal, San Jose.
October 13 —Stanford vs. Reli
ance, city.
October '20—Stanford vs. San
Jose Normal, campus.
October 27 - Freshman Intercol
legiate, city.
November I—Stanford vs. Idaho,
campus.
November 3— Stanford vs. Reli
ance, campus.
November 10 —Stanford vs. Ore
gon, campus.
November 17 —Stanford vs. Ne
vada, campus.
November 29 —Stanford vs. Cali
fornia, city.
The Freshman schedule has not
yet been completed, and will be
published separately as soon as
possible.
A new departure has been taken
this year in the matter of season
tickets to campus games. It will
be noticed that the schedule places
:t number of games here on the
campus, and these, together with
seven or eight freshman games, the
interchips games, and other games
of minor importance which are now
under consideration, will bring the
total number of campus games to
the neighberhood of twenty. The
season tickets will cost $2.50, mak
ing a saving for the season of fully
$2. The existing debt makes it
necessary that the prices of regular
tickets be raised this year, so the
season ticket offers a big reduction.
These tickets will be good for cam
pus games, but will not be good at
any games elsewhere. The season
tickets will not be transferable,
and will be taken up if any person
other than the purchaser attempts
to use them.
Those desiring to purchase the
season ticket may obtain them by
giving names and $2.50 to either
Manager Gildersleeve or Treasurer
Taylor, and the tickets will be
mailed to them the following day.
Names and money may be left at
the Bookstore also, addressed to
Treasurer Taylor, and tickets will
be mailed to the purchaser.
The old system of selling tickets
at the boundary of the grounds is
to be done away with this year, as
it is the intention to fence in the
athletic field. Bids for building
the fence are now being solicited.
The meeting of football men
which was held in Encina Friday
night was well attended and en
thusiastic. Speeches were made
by Coach Yost, ''Babe" Burnett,
Slaker, Gildersleeve, and Jack
Reynolds. In all, eighty-five men

signed the roll. Their names are

total number of campus games to
the neighberhood of twenty. The
season tickets will cost $2.50, mak
ing a saving for the season of fully
$2. The existing debt makes it
necessary that the prices of regular
tickets be raised this year, so the
season ticket offers a big reduction.
These tickets will be good for cam
pus games, but will not be good at
any games elsewhere. The season
tickets will not be transferable,
and will be taken up if any person
other than the purchaser attempts
to use them.
Those desiring to purchase the
season ticket may obtain them by
giving names and $2.50 to either
Manager Gildersleeve or Treasurer
Taylor, and the tickets will be
mailed to them the following day.
Names and money may be left at
the Bookstore also, addressed to
Treasurer Taylor, and tickets will
be mailed to the purchaser.
The old system of selling tickets
at the boundary of the grounds is
to be done away with this year, as
it is the intention to fence in the
athletic field. Bids for building
the fence are now being solicited.
