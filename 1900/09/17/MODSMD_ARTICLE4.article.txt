# SUNDAY SERMON
## Professor Burt Estes Howard Speaks on "True Greatness" in the Chapel. 
### 
The regular Sunday sermon was
delivered by Professor Burt Estes
Howard in the chapel yesterday
morning. The sermon was on the
subject "True Greatness," and the
speaker took as his text: " By faith
Abraham, when he was called,
obeyed to go out unto a place where
he was to receive an inheritance ;
and he went out, not knowing
whither he went." He said :
" When and where this man was
born into the world we do not know.
A few vague, broken whispers of
tradition, a meager list of names
purporting to be his genealogy, and
a sentence or two of record, vainly
try to tell the story of his earlier
years. Seventy-five years had he
lived and labored, treading the ways
of his fathers, when something en
tered into his life which changed
the whole course and meaning of it.
What that something was, and how
it seized this man and mastered
him, we can only conjecture. Some
how a mighty call sounded in his
conscience. It rose high above the
voices of his kinsmen. It dulled
the bleating of his flocks and the
lowing of his herds. It rang like a
trumpet-note over the drowsy altars
of his fathers' gods. He listened
and followed it.
" There is something that makes
the pulses leap and the blood tingle
in the spectacle of that grand old
man as he gathers his household
about him, and, lifting the flicker
ing rush-light of promise above his
head, forges out into the dark— not
knowing whither he went —fares
forth into the wilderness because
he believes that God has a work for
him to do out there in the unknown.
" Whenever God Almighty has
changed the processes of social or
political or religious evolution, He
has always done it by seizing
a man who has been growing
great-souled and great-hearted and
great-brained in some obscurity,
and thrusting him deep into the
thick of the world's life. Abraham
walks out upon the stage of history
unheralded. There comes a crisis
in human affairs. There is need
for the development of a new peo
ple and the organization of a purer
and finer national life. The call of
God rings out in the air, and from
his obscurity Abraham stalks forth
and answers to his name.
" It is far easier to criticise the
vices of great men than it is to em
ulate their virtue or duplicate their
deeds. It is said that virtue is its
own reward. Alas, too often is it
its only reward. And yet the truly
great soul has not failed when the
world of little men refused to rate
him at his worth. Greatness is not
the issue of ambition, but of devo
tion. It is the fruit of fidelity to a
great cause. Herein lies the differ
ence between Cromwell and Na
poleon, the one a great wild heart
dedicated to making England a
righteous nation, t he other a shrewd
strategist, iron willed, heartless, the
Prince of Butchers and the Father
of Lies, seeking to glut his selfish
ness i a world's blood.
" The truly great man is not the

man who can lead armies and plan
campaigns successfully. Your great
man may do these things, but his
greatness does not lie therein. It
lies rather in this, that he has seen
the face of Duty unveiled looking
at him out of the midst of life, and
has dared to follow it alone. To
see the truth and go forth with it
into the night where there is no
trail blazed to guide him and no
light save the glimmering stars of
promise and the burning of his own
soul, this is to be truly great.
" The countless hosts of men push
up into life, like earthworms crawl
ing through the sod, wriggle their
tortuous inch or two along the dust,
and then crawl back into the mould
that gave them birth, leaving
scarcely a trace to mark the day
time of their living—or at most a
crumbling epitaph bearing the
monotonous testimony that a man
was born, breathed a while, and
died.
" Let no man of us confuse true
greatness with the mere opportu
nity to exhibit it. The fact of it
does not depend on the exploitation
of it. And let no man of us min
imize the worth of his own life be
cause of the poverty of its equipment
for large activities. The world
needs great souls more than great
conditions today. It seems a hope
less task, this standing up single
handed and alone to tight God's
battle for justice and righteousness
and truth ; but the battle is not to
the strong. It is to the strong
hearted.
" These are the truly great—these
men and women who could live
like gods with only an average
man's chance at life, and who were
willing to live in 'the dust of their
petty treadmill existence a strong
and holy life, asking no reward of
chattering fame, and no monuments
save the fruits of their faithfulness."
