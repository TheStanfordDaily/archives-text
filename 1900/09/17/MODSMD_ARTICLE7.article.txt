Upon the Class of 1904 will soon
devolve the task of deciding upon a
class yell. In view of the fact, we
may perhaps be pardoned for in
dulging in a few remarks which
seem to us pertinent to the case.
A yell tit to be the property of a
body of University students must
have several characteristics, but
first of all it must be absolutely
distinctive of that class whose pos
session it is. It must have origi
nality, it must be unique. Failing
in that particular, its value is lost.
118 mediocrity will prevent it be
coming as popular as it otherwise
would, either with the class itself,
or with those aliens who guage
inter-class rivalry only through
the slogans of a football or base
ball contest. Now, although it
does not seem to be very generally
recognized by the class officials, it
is nevertheless a fact that the un
dergraduate yells of Stanford Uni
versity are wofully lacking in those
attributes that should be strongest â€”
in originality, in rhythm, we might
say in dignity did not the word
seem somewhat paradoxical in con
nection with such a subject. To
the uninitiated, there is hardly a
sound in any one of the class yells,
present or past, which would dis
tinguish it from the others. All
are but slight variations from one
model, a model which, by the way,
was long since out-grown, even by
preparatory schools. What we
want to urge, then, upon the Fresh
man Class is that it consider the
matter carefully, and finally adopt
a yell which shall not only be
worthy of the University as a
whole, but shall be entirely distinc
tive of the class and that class
alone.
