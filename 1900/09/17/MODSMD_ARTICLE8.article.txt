The announcement in this paper
calling for a meeting of the track
men should be responded to by
every man in college who intends

to do anything on the track this
coming season. It can never be
too early to begin training; in fact,
our best athletes are practically,
more or less, always in condition.
We should at this meeting try to
put under way some definite plan
of fall training for the track team.
The baseball team has adopted fall
practice, and why should not our
track interests demand the same
attention as any other branch of
athletics? Then again, this meet
ing should result in bringing to
gether all the new material in col
lege and putting them in touch and
sympathy with Stanford methods.
The new men should not neglect
the opportunity of attending this
meeting, as it affords the manage
ment a chance to size up the ma
terial and to lay plans for the best
method of procedure. Of course in
the present state of student body
finances, there can not be very
much of a lavish expenditure
for the purposes of track athletics,
but assuredly the student body
can afford something for the track,
for judging from the material at
present in the University, its pros
pects are very bright. We can not
expect very enthusiastic track men
without energetic support from the
students, and our track men who
have done so much for Stanford in
the past deserve great credit for
their loyalty to the Cardinal. The
Eastern trip of the University of
California track team and their re
ception by Eastern colleges has
given an impetus to track men on
this Coast. We cannot expect to
attract track men here and keep
them unless we attempt something
of the same nature that will make
it an object for our track men to do
their very best. There is no time
like the present, and why not do
something definite in regard to
track athletics this year, before it
is too late?
