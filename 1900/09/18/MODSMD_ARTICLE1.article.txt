# BACK FROM JAPAN.
## Interesting Account of the Collecting Expedition that Recently Returned. 
### 
John 0. Snyder, instructor in
Zoology, who accompanied Dr. Jor
dan on his recent trip to Japan,
returned to the University last Fri
day evening. In an interview
with a Daily Palo Alto represen
tative, he gave the following ac
count of his trip:
The expedition was sent out in
the interests of the University and
was aided by Timothy Hopkins.
The Occidental and Oriental and
the Toyo Kisen Kaisha Steamship
Com pa n ies carried their materials
and collections free.
They sailed from San Francisco
June bth and visited the three
principal islands of Japan, Hak
kaido, Nippon and Kyushu. They
fished along the coasts, traveling
completely around each of the
islands as well as exploring the
interior. The country explored
was very thoroughly gone over and
complete collections or descrip
tions have been made.
They collected specimens of
nearly all species known, as well
as 120 species entirely new to
science. The collection embraces
both fresh-and salt-water fishes,
off-shore and deep-sea lishes and
tide-pool fishes.
A number of specimens were fur
nished them by the Imperial Mu
seum and the Imperial I luversity
at Tokio, as well as the Fisheries
Bureau. The officials were every
where courteous and polite and did
everything in their power to aid
them in collecting. Besides this,
tliev were aided by the professors
of the Imperial Udiversity, by the
officials of the Fisheries' Bureau,
and missionaries.
In all, they collected forty large
boxes of specimens numbering
many thousands, and containing
more than 700 species, besides
many specimens of reptiles, inver
tebrates, and birds. This collection
will go far to supplement the al
ready large collection of Japanese
fishes belonging to the University,
and will settle a good many qites
tions of nomenclature and distri
bution. The collection will he the
basis for a number of preliminary
scientific papers, and later a com
plete synopsis of the "Fishes of Ja
pan" will be published.
The party returned on the .Japan
ese steamer Nippon Maru, arriving
io San Francisco last Friday. On
both passages stops were made at
Honolulu, where fish were collected
in the fish markets.
In regard to the Chinese question
in Japan, Mr. Snyder said that
there seemed to he not much more
interest than in this country, al
though he saw large numbers of
troops constantly on the move.
Not being able to converse with the
natives, he was unable to arrive at
a just conclusion regarding Japan
ese sentiment toward China.
They met many Stanford gradu
ates in Japan, among whom were
Kernosuke Otaki, Zoology, '5)4, who
is at present professor of English
in a military school at Tokio;
Frank K. Ab6, Economics, '98, who
is employed as legal counselor for

the Imperial Toyo Kisen Kaisha
Steamship Company. B. I). Spoon
er, '5)5), is tutor in the family of
the Siamese minister anil holds
an official appointment, in the Si
amese legation. He is also at
tending the Imperial Univer
sity at Tokio. James Francis
Abbott, '99, is attending the
Imperial University and expects
to go to Germany next year.
The party returned with S. 1. Ku
wana, who was sent out by the
Entomology department to study
the San Jose scale insect in Japan.
The Zoology department is
highly pleased over the successful
result of the expedition, as it will
materially aid in making an ex
haustive study of the fishes of
Japan.
