The nuisanck of the posts on the
pathways to Pulo Alto still per
sists. A short while ago there was
a clear path on the west sitle he
cause the posts had heen judicious
ly uprooted, but they have heen re
placed by others with cross-pieces
on their lower ends so that they
cannot he easily pulled up again.
It would seem that the only recourse
in the hands of the students who
are endangered hy such obstruc
tions is to saw the posts off flush
with the ground; that is, if they
have to take the matter into their

own hands. It is to be hoped that
they will not have to; it is to be
hoped that the person or persons
responsible for the imbecile pres
ence of the posts will realize that
there are other means of keeping
suppositious vehicles off the paths.
A sign would serve the purpose, —
it might be hung over the walk
where it would not be harmful;
though in spite of every interroga
tion there has been no one who
has seen a vehicle on the path. If
the aesthetic ideals of the post-pro
moter insist that his precautionary
measure take its present form, the
least that he can do is to paint the
offending objects with a luminous
or phosphorescent paint so they
can be seen at night.
