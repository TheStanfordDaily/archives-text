A meeting of students interested
in the University Band was held
last night in the chapel. The
band was reorganized for the com
ing season and new officers elected,
resulting as follows: President,
Harry Lucas,'o2; secretary, A. S.
Hatley, '03; manager, W. R.
Eraser, '03. It was decided to ap
point, a committee to confer with
the Executive Committee in regard
to procuring the services of a pro
fessional leader and new uniforms
for the members. There are a
good many places to he filled this
year and new men are needed.
Those interested in working up a
good band here are anxious to be
gin practicing immediately, so that
they can furnish music for the
campus games this year. If the
interest in band affairs proves
great enough a strong concert band
will be perfected, and remain in
active organization throughout the
college year.
