# Eastern Football.
## 
### 
Monday, September 17th, marked
the opening of the football season
throughout the East. Princeton,
Vale, Harvard, and Pennsylvania
all began their actual work under
their coaches. Desultory work has
already been done t>y individuals
but no systematic training has
been held to. From now on hard
work will be the order of affairs.
Pennsylvania has many vacan
cies to fill, her greatest gap being
at center and guard. Overfield,
who has played this position for
four years, was considered the best
in the country and his place will
be hard to fill. Princeton is also
in difficulty regarding its line for
mation and six new men must fce
developed, to fill the vacancies, Cap
tain Mell being the only man of
last year's line to return to college,
lleiter and McCord, the halfbacks,
and Hutchinson, last year's quar
ter, are in college, so the back of
the line is as strong as in 1891).
Harvard is the most fortunate of
all the big universities. Beside
Daly, the doughty little captain,
there will be Campbell, Burnett,
Eaton, C. Sargent, Barnard, and
Kistine on hand to build the team
to. The prospect for new players
is also promising, and Harvard au
thorities predict a sweeping victory
over Yale. Last year's captain,
Malcom Mcßride, is to be the head
coach at Yale this year. He has
mapped out his line of work and
has all but two of last year's Yale
team back in college to begin prac
tice with.
Owing to petty jealousies, Yale
j and Princeton do not play with
' Pennsylvania and Princeton bars
Harvard. Thus the only way that
critics have been able to judge the
| comparative merits of the different
teams is from the Yale-Harvard
and the Pennsylvania-Harvard
j games.
In the West, Michigan and Wis
consin begin their work next week.
Northwestern, Chicago, and Illinois
are now hard at it, and Beloit and
Minnesota start in a dav or two. —
