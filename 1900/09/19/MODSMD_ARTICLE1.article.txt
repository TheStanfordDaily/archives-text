# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## The 						First Line-up of the Season, Tuesday, Marks the Beginning of Heavy Work. 
### 
Last night's practice was the
most interesting one so far this sea
son. There were enough men on
the field to form six elevens for
practice, and every man played
with spirit. Last night marked a
turning point in the season's work,
as it witnessed the first liue-up of
the year. The men have progressed
far "enough to warrant heavier
practice, and accordingly two elev
ens of Freshmen were lined up for
ten minutes' brisk play. The
Freshmen showed good form, and
went, at the play with a vim and
dash that speaks well for their fu
ture work. Each team scored a
touchdown. Following is the line-up:
Scoville 1 e Saunders
Lunt ..1t.... . Burton
Harper 1 g Beebe
Gregory c McFadden
Thompson r g Grant
Davis r t Lemmon
Chandler re l'.illen
Moore q b Bonn bach
Wiggins 1 h Clark
Stanford r h Patterson
Taylor 112 b DeWitt
The Varsity has not yet lined up,
but will do so possibly by Friday
and at least by Monday night.
Signals will be given out by the
last of the week. From now on
there will be daily line-ups, and
after Monday there will be two,
one of Varsity players, the other of

Freshmen.
The training house is being im
proved and the showers will be
ready for use in a few days. It is
of course impossible to state when
the training table will be begun,
but it will be putin operation just
as soon as the work done warrants
it.
