The University Band is an or
ganization that deserves the hearty
support and co-operation of the
student body. Stanford has al
ways had a very good college band,
but it has been organized only
temporarily and in a very hurried
manner for the sole purpose of
playing for the football game.
With the close of the season each
year has marked the break-up of
the band. The action taken at the
meeting the other evening looking
toward a permanent band organi
zation should be commended and
encouraged. There is plenty of
need for a good band the year
round. The band should be just
as much a feature of the spring
athletic contests as it is at the foot
ball games in the fall. The band
could occupy just as important a
place as the Glee and Mandolin
Clubs or other musical organiza
tions. Then again the announce
ment that the band will attempt to
play at more football practices
than formerly is encouraging.
There is nothing more encouraging
to both spectators and players than
the quick strains of some of Sousa's
two-steps. The music seems to
unite the spectators, and it has

been frequently noted that the
bleachers feel more like "jollying
up" when the band is out at prac
tice. If the band could come out
regularly, perhaps a couple of times
a week, it would be found to have
a beneficial effect on the bleachers,
even if it did nothing more than
bring the crowd out to practice.
