The proposed plan of the man
agement of the 1902 Annual to
have the Quad contain the pictures
of each member of the class is
something out of the ordinary in
Stanford Annuals. Such a plan
has been adopted with great suc
cess at various other colleges, es
pecially at Berkeley. It certainly
makes the annual more valuable to
a member of the class, as it will al
ways be a valuable souvenir of col
lege days. Whether the plan will
be a success at Stanford is another
matter. One thing against it is
the great lack of that fierce feeling
of class loyalty and class pride so
common in other colleges and so
markedly absent here. This is due
to our system, and by reason of that
system very few men can tell until
their senior year just what classes
they really are members of. An
other thing—owing to this lack of
class system the habit of paying
class assessments has not been very
clearly developed. The proposed
assessment is much larger than
customary, and former managers of
Annuals have always experienced
considerable difficulty in collecting
a sufficient number of assessments
to guarantee the Annual's success.
In planning for next year's Annual
such things should be taken into
account. The Class of 1902 is very
small, and therefore less assess
ments than usual must be expected,
and besides it would seem that the
class is too small to stand the ex
pense of such an undertaking. The
matter is worth the careful consid
eration of the class and should be
thoroughly investigated before ac
tion is taken.
