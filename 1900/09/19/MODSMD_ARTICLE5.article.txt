Miss M. E. McDougald, editor-in
chief of the 1902 Annual, today
published the list of those who will
be associated with her on the board
of editors for the Quad. They are
as follows: J. K. Bunnell, G. W.
Dryer, K. S. Fisher, ,1. Burt Gilder
sleeve, S. W. Hardy, Leon L. Loof
bourow, R. -J. Stennett, C. A. Whit
more, Miss May Hurlburt, Miss
Hazel 11. Webster. M. F. McCor
mick, business manager.
No definite plans have been ar
ranged as yet, as it is too early in
the year. Work in earnest will
not commence until next semester.
The new board is strong in talent,
both literary and artistic. With
the art work in the hands of such
capable men as It. .J. Sterrett and
,J. K. Bunnell, who has just re
turned from two years' study in
art abroad, the. Quad promises to
be one of the best vet issued.
