# INVESTIGATED SCALE INSECTS
## S.T. Kuwana, Assistant in Entomology, Returns from a Trip to Japan. 
### 
S. 1. Kuvvana, assistant in the
Entomology department of the Uni
versity, returned on the same
steamer Friday with Dr. Jordan
and Mr. Snyder, who were in the
Orient studying Japanese fishes.
Mr. Kuwana visited hi* native land
for the purpose of studying .Japa
nese scale insects, and he has
brought back with him if tine col
lection of San Jose scale and other
known forms, together with many
new ones, and six new parasites of
the San Jose scale, which is now
acknowledged to be the most dan
gerous fruit pest in America. Mr.
Kuwana paid particular attention
to this scale. He visited every
island of the Japanese Archipelago,
and penetrated to the interior of
the largest islands. He found
scale every where and studied them
in all stages of growth, health, and
abundance.
The San Jose scale is believed to
have originated in Japan, and if so
it is reasonable to search there for
native parasites. This Mr. Ku
wana did, and six insects were
found to feed on the San Jose scale,
though whether all are new forms
or not has not been determined.
The larvae of one moth feed upon
the scale, two kinds of ladybugs,
and three icheneurnan flies. The
result of the examination of these
parasites in the department here
will be published later.
Japan is badly infested with San
Jose scale. It attacks principally
the pear and apple trees, frequently
killing old trees. In Mr. Ku
wana's collection is a specimen of a
tree forty-five years old killed by
scale. The insects literally cover
every speck of the bark. The
trunk of this tree was eighteen
inches through.
The Japanese government has
now established a central experi
ment station at Tokio, and em
ployed three entomologists. In
spi te of this activity in fighting scale
insects, only about thirty of the
most injurious insects are known.
It presents a line field for the ento
mologist. Mr. Kuwana's collec
tion is the largest yet made of Jap
anese scale, and will undoubtedly
contain many new and interesting
forms. From this material he will
spend the winter in working up for
publication the first monograph on
Japanese scale.
While in Japan Mr. Kuwana at
tended several banquets, made a
number of addresses on economic
entomology, and was shown much
courtesy by scientific men. He
made arrangements, before leaving,
to secure any additional data or
specimens, and if the new parasites
for the eradication of San Jose scale
prove adaptable to conditions in
America, some practical experi
ments will be made along this line.
