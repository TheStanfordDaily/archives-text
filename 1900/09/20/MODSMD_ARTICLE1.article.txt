# LAST NIGHT'S PRACTICE.
## Interesting Exhibition of Football Furnished by the Freshmen. 
### 
The large crowd which filled the
bleachers at last night's practice
was not in the least disappointed
in the exhibition of football which
it witnessed. The first part of the
practice was given over to a short
line-up of Freshmen, and the play
wis very interesting and at times
exciting.
Coach Yost had provided a di
version in the shape of a game be
tween special and regular Fresh
men, and both teams played fast
ball. The play abounded in long
runs and good individual work,
but the team work was of course a
trifle ragged. The regulars scored
twice against the specials, but the
latter team was unable to cross its
opponent's goal. Following is the
line-up:
REGULARS. SPECIALS.
Moore 1 e Harper
Lunt 1t... Frederickson
Nichols I g Chandler
Burton c Gregory
McFadden r g Thompson
Kennedy r t Grant
Scoville re S. Davis

After the Freshman practice the

fast signal practice for a few min
utes. The first game of the season

Freshmen will meet the Hoitt's
School eleven.
