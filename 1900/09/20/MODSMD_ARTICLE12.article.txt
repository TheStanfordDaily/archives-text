The spectators at the football
practice should be careful to keep
off the cinder track. The track
management are preparing to start
fall training, and the track will be
put into shape at once. It will be
impossible to keep the track in
any sort of condition for training if
the spectators do not keep off of it.
It is now in such bad condition
that it will take a considerable
amount to put it into shape again.
There is plenty of room on the
bleachers for all who wish to see
the practice. There is no need
of interfering with the track
men and causing a great deal
of unnecessary expense to the track
management, just for the pleasure
of watching the game at closer
range.
