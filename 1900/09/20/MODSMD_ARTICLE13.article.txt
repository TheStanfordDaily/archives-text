The Senior Class passed resolu
tions at their meeting yesterday
afternoon requesting members of
lower classes to abstain from wear
ing sombreros about the University.
Complaint was made by several
of the seniors present that cer
tain students were transgressing on
University customs in this particu
lar. This is a young university,
and we have as yet very few tradi
tions. If we wish to build up
some, every one will have to unite
in an earnest effort in their behalf.

The principal argument in favor of
adopting the sombrero as the senior
hat was that the last two classes
had done ho, and this class in fol
lowing suit would do much toward
making it a custom here. How
ever, if any students beside sen
iors and graduates are Keen with
them on it will be impossible for it
to become a tradition. Most of the
persons who are trespassing on for
bidden ground in this respect do
not understand the significance of
the sombrero, and therefore are
partly excusable. A word from an
upper-classingn will usually bring
about a discontinuance of the of
fense. Of course we have a few
"perpetual freshmen" in our midst,
who think it smart to do what they
should not do. Ducking or some
other kind of hazing may have to
be resorted to in their case. Let us
all unite to make it as much an un
written law that only seniors shall
wear sombreros as it now is that no
one shall smoke on the quad.
