# Glee Club Meeting.
## 
### 
The Glee Club met for its first
rehearsal last night in the ci it pel.
The men sung together remarkably
well for the first time, considering
the number of new men in the club.
A number of songs from the East
ern colleges were tried with marked
success, and the club will use more
college songs in its concerts this
year than has been the custom
before.
The Glee Club intends learning
the football songs as soon as they
appear, and will be on the bleach
ers once or twice a week to lead
the singing. This is a good move
and will win for them the good
will and support of the student
body.
The musical clubs intend giving
a conceit during the second week
in October, the proceeds to go to
ward the paying of last year's de
ficit and replenishing the general
treasury of the student body. This
will be the first opportunity of
hearing the Glee Club this year
and should draw a crowded house.
