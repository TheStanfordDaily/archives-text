second issue ol the Chnpur
ppeared yesterday and was
than the first issue, excel
s that one was. The jokes
better, the short sketches

dergraduate verse through the
selections that were afterwards
gathered in " Four Leafed Clover."

the best things in each department
of prose and verse and drawing
were the skit, "His Doom was
Sealed," by Larry Bowman, Field's
"Lines to a Tramp Dog," and Cul
ver's drawing '' A Sure l ip," —the
latter would have made a hit in
