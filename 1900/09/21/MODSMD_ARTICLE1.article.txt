## Freshmen vs. Hoitt's, Tomorrow. Last Night's Practice. Baseball Men at Work. 
### 
Tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. the first
match game of the season will be
played on the campus, between the
Freshmen and the Hoitt's School
eleven. The Freshmen have been
practicing in earnest the past week
and they may be expected to put
up a good article of ball in this,
their first game. The admission
fee will be 25 cents, and at this
price there should be a good crowd
on the bleachers to encourage the
team. Season tickets can be pur
chased at the grounds tomorrow for
the regular price, and will be good
of course for tomorrow's game. The
two teams will line up as follows:
FRESHMEN. HOITT'S.

The Freshmen lined up last
night for a short time and played
a fast, smashing game. A number
of the men are showing up to a
good advantage, and their spirit
and willingness to play a hard
game might be a good example for
many older players to follow.
Lemmon and Grant were both in
jured in the practice last night and
were retired from the game. Fol
lowing is the line-up:
Scoville 1 e . Moore
Frederickson . . ..1 t Lunt
Thompson 1 g Young
Gregory c Burton
Jacobs r g Kennedy
Stephenson r t McComas
Davis re Patterson

Coach Yost is very well pleased
with the week's practice and ex
presses himself as very well satis
fied with everything so far. The
Varsity men are improving won
derfully and their work last night
in signal practice was very good.
The men are all in good physical
condition and are playing a fast
game.
Dr. Murphy has had a small
squad out this week on the base
ball field putting them through
batting and fielding practice. Not
very many new men have turned
out, but there is in all probability
plenty of good material iis : 04,
which will come to the front later.
