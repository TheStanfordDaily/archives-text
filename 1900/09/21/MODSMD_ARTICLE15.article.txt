# Christian Association Outing.
## 
### 
Tomorrow the Christian Associa
tions will give the first of a series
ot outings, a tramp to the Basaltic
Columns, Adelante Villa, and the
Quarry, a round-trip of about three
or four miles. All students of the
University and their friends are in
vited to participate. A party will
leave the quad near the Zoological
laboratory at nine o'clock Saturday
morning of this week. Lunches
will be carried, each person provid
ing his own. Demijohns will be
serviceable, as the creek water is
unfit for use, and Adelante Villa is
the nearest point for good water
supply. Those who cannot spend
the entire day with the party are
urged to take their lunch with them
at about 12:45. Bicyclists will find
the trip short, but delightful. Those
who desire a long tramp will have
opportunities for side-trips.
