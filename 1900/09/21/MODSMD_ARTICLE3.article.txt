acquisition of territory. In
■ . she discovered a great soldier
ilobert Clive. The directors of
i found that they must drive
lie French if the East Indian
pany was to continue to pay
dividends to the stockholders.
The task of securing empire in
India was undertaken by Eng
land against the will of the direc
tors of the company, of the ad
ministration, and of the English
people, bin it was forced upon them
by the necessity of having peace
for the continuation of trade.
Englishmen found the task of
empire both hard and unpopular.
This is »n important fact to be
borne in mind.
"It is an unfortunate fact that
Warren Hastings is judged chiefly
by Macaulay's well-known essay.
This essay was written at the time
of Hastings' trial, and represented
English public opinion at that
time, and was not, therefore, a cor
rect estimate of Hastings' abilities
as Governor of India. When Has
tings first entered the Company,
instead of devoting himself to
study, he interested himself in the
government of India, and from one
point of view he solved the problem.
He founded a system of adminis
tration for Bengal which has been
a marvel of success, and has been
adopted since throughout the
Kingdom. Hastings had to em
ploy, as assessors of taxes, men
familiar with the laws and customs
of India, and, as a result, taxes
were paid in full. He also used all
the expert opinion he could get in
determining his system of govern
ment. His was the basis of Eng
land's government of India for

years, a government in accordance
with the ideas of the Indian peo
ples. Everything was done to dis
courage the propagation of Western
ideas.
"Lord William lientley, when lie
assumed the governorship of India,
started a reaction from Hastings'
policy. A resolution was pushed
through the House of Commons
that missionaries should preach in
India. Bentley also maintained
that the government had no right
(o continue the practice of widow
burning. But Bentley soon saw
that if he attempted to put a stop
to this custom, there was a possi
bility of an insurrection. The wid
ows preferred to he burned. In
another matter, too, that of estab
lishing English as the language to
be used between the different peo
ples of India, Bentley offended the
natives. In short, the English
ideas came in so quickly that the
natives thought they would lose
both their laws and their freedom.
The mutiny of 1807 was due to
these causes, as well as to the gen
eral decadence of Indian govern
ment, and the dissatisfaction of the
native soldiers.
"After the uniting, England
learned several things. It led to
the adoption of free trade, which
put an end to the ideal of holding
India solely for the purpose of
trade with the home country. A
division had to be made, too, in
the administration of India. At
the present time the Indian succes
sion is preserved and their ideals
and standards of religion are re
spected, while, under English gov
ernment, reforms are introduced
slowly. Among others things,
widows are no longer burned. Lord
Curzon is a good representative
of the present government of India.
Under his administration the Ori
entals really do take kindly to re
forms.
"In Malaysia, England's empire
has grown up quietly. Residents
have been placed there,and civiliza
tion has been developed according
to native ideas.
"From her experience in India
England has learned not to attempt
to rule by annexation of new ter
ritory and the assumption of com
plete sovereignty over it, but by
introducing gradual reforms and
establishing a successful though
unpopular government. History
has learned a great lesson from
England's administration of India,
which, in Kipling's words, is ' Not
to hustle the East.'
" in the regeneration of China, we
must decide whether to follow the
Japanese example or that of Eng
land in India. In either case we
had better give China the benefit of
what we have learned from our own
experience in Asia, and attempt to
civilize them by our own standards
and theirs."
