Tomorrow afternoon the first
campus game of the season will be
held, and a chance will be given
the University to size up the
Freshman football material as it
lines up for the first time against
an outside eleven. The event
should draw a large crowd, for the
Freshmen have been practicing
hard and should put up a strong
game, considering the short time
they have practiced together. The
members of the Class of 1904 should
make an effort to attend in a body
and encourage their team.
