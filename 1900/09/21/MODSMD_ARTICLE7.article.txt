The Executive Committek should
consider the appointment of a cus
todian to have charge of the stu
dent body property. There is con
siderable property belonging to
the Associated Students that is al
lowed to lay around loose and un
cared for, and finally to become
destroyed through want of repairs
and lack of responsibility as to its
welfare. Many instances might be
shown to prove this, as for instance
last year, through the lack of any
person whose business it was to
look after the scenery stored in En
cina gymnasium and see that it
was properly taken care of,
when wanted it was found to be
destroyed by dampness. Thus
when scenery was needed the stu
dent body was forced to buy an en
tirely new set. Again, the bass
drum belonging to the band in
stead of being in the storeroom,
where it belongs, is down in the
baggage room at the depot where it
has been since last Thanksgiving,
solely because no one is responsible
for its safety, and the person who
had it was too indifferent to bring
it down to the Hall. The hurdles
on the track, and all the other long
list of student body property
would be in better shape and last
longer if some person was made re
sponsible for their good condition,

and to see that they are kept in re
pair. It is useless to expect the
managers to do this personally.
They are generally too busy to see
that this is done properly. The of
fice of custodian if given to the
proper man would more than re
pay the student body for the small 1
outlay in salary, in the amount of
expense that would be saved each
year, and the satisfaction of know
ing that the student body property
was being looked after by a respon
sible party. We submit this prop
osition to the careful consideration
of the Executive Committee.
