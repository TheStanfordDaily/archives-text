# The
						"Sequoia."
## 
### 
The second number of the Se
quoia contains extra pages to make
room for "Twenty Minutes After
Four," a capital Stanford story,
and "Old Harris's Will," a tale of
the eerie sort. The magazine con
tains a sonnet by Miss Dennen,
and a description of the Dutch
Kermis, especially interesting to
those who remember the Kermis
held in our Museum in October, '97.
"The Portfolio," though small in
spicy. Stanford's share in "Cap
and Gown in Prose" receives notice.
