# FRESHMEN VICTORIOUS.
## The 						Favorable Score 29-0 Is the Record of Their First Game. Varsity Lines Up. 
### 
Saturday's game between the
Freshmen and the Hoitt's School
team was even an easier game than
the most enthusiastic had hoped
for. At no time in the game was
the Stanford goal in danger, while
the continuous and rapid progress
of the ball in the opposite direction
was rather monotonous.
In all, live touchdowns and four
goals were made, making the very
one-sided score of 29-0 in favor of
the Freshmen.
It was a hot day for football,
and even in the bleachers the heat
was almost unbearable. Neverthe
less, the game was fast and hard,
and the Freshmen may be congrat
ulated on the pluck they showed in
their first game. There was, of
course, little or no team work on
the part of Stanford, but the backs
and tackles showed up well in in
dividual work. Of these, Taylor,
Lunt, Wiggins, and Clark were
particularly brilliant in their play,
each one repeatedly advancing the
ball for large gains. The defensive
work of the Freshmen was also
good when Hoitt's was able to se
cure the ball.
The Hoitt's team was weakened
by the absence of two of their best
men, but put up a good up-hill
fight. It was evident from the
start that they were outclassed, but
they were game to the last. They
seemed to be utterly unable to stop
the lierce smashes of the Stanford
line men, and their ends were cir
cled repeatedly for long runs by
the Freshman backs. For Hoitt's,
Reed, Irish, and Howell showed up
best in their individual work.
Long runs were the order of the
day, and line bucks of from 5 to 10
yards were common. Very little
kicking was indulged in, and the
fumbles, though few in number,
were costly ones. Following is the
line-up:
STANFORD. HOITT'S.
Scoville 1 e Kilburn

The Varsity lined up for the
first time tonight for ten minutes
of brisk play. From now on there
will be two line-ups each evening,
and the practice should increase in
interest every day. The Varsity
plays its first game of the season
next Saturday, on the campus,
against the Reliance team of Oak
