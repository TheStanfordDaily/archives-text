The movement to exempt Stan
ford University from taxation is
one that should receive great em
phasis by every loyal student and
friend of Stanford. Already con
siderable lias been done by the
Alumni, and the Tax Exemption
Club has succeeded in having the
necessary constitutional amend
ment brought up before the people
at the election in November. Now
comes the time when every Stan
ford student can lend his influence
and his voice to see that this
amendment is brought to the atten
tion of the voters throughout the
State. In a free institution like
ours, one tJiat is as certainly a part
of the State and does as much for
the upbuilding of the State as the
State University, there is no reason
why we should be forced to pay a
tax on our buildings and equip
ment. The amendment does not
ask that the entire endowment

should be exempt, only the campus
and Palo Alto property with the
regular uuiversity appurtenances.
Wherever the students go they
should not fail to mention the pro
posed amendment and speak for
its favorable consideration at the
hands of the electors of this State.
Here at Stanford, there are repre
sentatives from every community
in the State, and nearly every stu
dent here can do some good by
mentioning it to their friends.
The time is short, only about six
weeks remain, but much can be
done. The Alumni are working
earnestly in behalf of the measure,
and now the students must take it
up in earnest, in behalf of the
Greater Stanford University and
its immense possibilities in the
near future.
