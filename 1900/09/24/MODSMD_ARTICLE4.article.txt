## The 						Outer and Inner Life Discussed by Professor Lovejoy in the Chapel. 
### 
Professor Arthur O. Lovejoy of
the Philosophy department deliv
ered the sermon yesterday morn
ing in the chapel on the "Inner and
the Outer Life." His text was
from St. Paul's advice to the Colos
sians: "Set your mind on things
above, not on things of this earth."
lie said:
"Through most of the Christian
centuries, the antithesis between
the two worlds —that of the Chris
tian, which is above, and the world
outside of lis —has dominated Chris
tian thought. To the early Chris
tian the world was an uninterest
ing place. As Christianity devel
oped the antithesis sharpened.
What men sought in religion was
something entirely above and be
yond this life. As St. Paul says,
the Christian was already dead,
iiis business was elsewhere.
"So long as the antithesis re
mains between the outer and the
inner life, so long will there be a
breach between the men of the
world —those who feel the true zest
of living—and the mystic. For
the weak and the sick, the incap
able, this kind of religion is a good
thing, but to the strong, happy
man it can say very little. It
must either catch its man at adol
escence or wait until it could grasp
the inner life. To those for whom
religious discipline is directed, re
ligion is prepared to make life dis
agreeable. In Protestantism, the
spirit of Puritanism denied inno
cent enjoyments to the young, in
order to make them secure in the
study of the inner life and not be
allured by the pleasures of this life.
"The main course of modern re
flection has tended to turn away
from the other world and to fix our
affections on this life. This is not
a tendency to turn from religion,
but it means an interest in the
tilings about you. The intellectual
tendency against other worldliness
shows itself in its dislike of Me
diseval thought and to have an un
salable curiosity toward the life
outside: the growing conviction
that man finds God best not by
looking within, but by living and
placing his interests in the joys of
life. This has been carried so far
that some people cannot see
any interest in the family wor
ship and other religious exercises.
True piety demands that we should
take up cheerfully the burdens laid
upon us, with an alert interest in
the truth about us. We do not
build schools, libraries, and uni
versities in the same spirit that
monasteries and 'cathedrals were
built formerly. The chief end of
universities now is that they exist
not merely to teach men to earn
bread and butter, but to give men
such training that they will go out
into life with a better understand
ing of its larger meaning. The
first duty of man is to find his
life interesting, and if he fails here,
he fails on the main point.
"There are many men who show
the high piety of this world, and
the question naturally arises, has
the older religion anything to

teach these men? Is the natural
life sufficient, and is there no place
for the inner life? The outer life
can only build itself up on the in
spiration of the inner. The reason
why the natural life is not suffic
ient is that even among our natu
ral impulses we have to make a
choice, and in order to make a
choice there must be a deliberate
reflection.
"If a man experiences some of
the strength of inner life, it ought
to signify to us something strange,
but we should realize that it is a
call to action. The conscious use
of the inner life is the basis of the
outer life and is not subject to
change. It will enable a man to
live among the things of the world
with that affection and cheerful
ness which is always the best type
of God."
