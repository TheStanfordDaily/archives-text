The prize football song compe
tition should attract a large num
ber of competitors and should re
sult in adding a large number of
good new songs to our list. With
the effort to arouse an interest in
singing here at Stanford, there will
come a demand for new songs. If
singing is to be popular there must
be songs that can be sung easily
and that have some go to them.
There can be no doubt that if songs
were written that everybody could
sing there would be more singing.
The matter of the prize song should
be advertised as much as possible,
for there are, doubtless, many stu
dents who can write very acceptable
songs if they will only try. Even
if the songs do not win the prize, a
good many of them doubtless will
be acceptable enough to publish in
the song-book. Every one who
can should try for the prize, as a
large number of good songs are
needed.
