# CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
## Movement on Foot to Exempt Stanford University from State Taxation. 
### 
The Stanford. University Consti
tutional Amendment Club has been
formally organized, and is now pre
pared to start the campaign in fa
vor of the proposed amendment to
the State Constitution which is to
be voted on in November next.
The Constitutional Amendment
Club met in San Francisco last
Saturday and outlined its plan for
the coming campaign. Besides
Stanford alumni, who are of course
most vitally interested in the move
ment, the San Francisco branch of
the organization numbers among
its members and oflicers graduates
from the University of California.
Indeed, the plan is to attempt to
interest all parties and classes in
the success of the movement, so as
to make it an object for the general
welfare of the commonwealth. The
officers of the association are: H.
H. Brown, '90, president; Oscar
Sutro, U. C., '94, vice-president; L.
S. Beedy, '98, secretary-treasurer;
and an executive committee com
posed of Walter M. Rose, 95, Ar
chie Rice, '95, J. P. Bern hard, '96,
J. H. Timmons, '97, and James
Murphy, '98. It is the plan of the
Alumni Association, who are con
ducting the movement, to form
similar clubs throughout the State,
and to carry on the campaign re
gardless of party affiliations.
At the meeting last Saturday,
George Crothers, '95, who is at
present at the head of the move
ment, read a letter from S. K. Lieb
of San Jose, who is president of the
Board of Trustees of the University,
of which the following is a part:
George E. Crothers, Esq., Presi
dent of the Stanford Univer
sity Constitutional Amendment
Club.
Dear Silt: —In answer to your
favor of the 19th inst., asking me
to give my views as to the proposed
constitutional amendment which
relates to the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University, and which is to be
voted upon by the people of this
State at the general election in No
vember, 1 have this to Bay:
The act of the Legislature under
which the University was founded
and endowed was, unfortunately,
loosely drawn. The chief object
of the proposed constitutional
amendment is to remedy the de
fects of the legislative . act, and to
render futile any possible attempt
to disturb the validity of the large
endowments made for the benefit
of the University, and to make
this proposition so manifest that it
will probably prevent even an at
tempt to litigate the validity of
those endowments.
There is a matter, however, which
I think ought to be here mentioned.
J understand on the best of author
ity that a gentleman, resident of
another country, closely related to
the late Senator Stanford, and who,
like the late Senator, is without
immediate heirs, intends, if he can
legally do so, to leave by will al
most all of his vast estate to the
Leland Stanford Jr. University.
But the statute on which that
University was founded provides

that property may be given by
"grant" (no provision being made
for property left by will)] and pro
vides that such property so granted
shall be "any property, real or per
sonal, belonging to such person,
and situated or being within this
State.' 1 This would seem to pre
clude the University from receiving
any property not within the State.
The proposed constitutional amend
ment cures ihis defect, and also
provides that property may be
given to the University by will as
well as by yrant. I know of at
least one other person who is with
out immediate heirs, and who
would be glad to leave property to
the University by will who does
not like to part with it by grant
during his life. Doubtfess there
are still others similarly circum
stanced and of like mind.
It will be observed from the read
ing of this proposed amendment
that the following propositions are
true:
First. No real estate can be ex
empted from county or local taxes
except in the county ot Santa Cla
ra, where the University grounds
and buildings are situated. There
fore no county or city treasury can
be made poorer by reason of the
non-taxation of real estate except
ing only the county of Santa Clara,
and there only by the non-taxation
of the University lands on which are
the University buildings, and to this
limited exemption 1 feel sure a 1
great majority of the tax payers of
Santa Clara county will consent,
as their vote on this proposed con
stitutional amendment will un
doubtedly show.
Second. The provision that the
legislature may exempt personal
property can do no harm to the
State. The personal property of
the University will necessarily con
sist almost exclusively of approved
securities. If this amendment does
not pass, securities will necessarily,
as a business proposition, have to
be selected of a kind that are not
taxable. Securities of that class,
such as government bonds, always
bear a low rate of interest, and if
such low interest-bearing securities
are selected, the income of the Uni
versity will be much reduced and
its efficiency much impaired, and
the State be no richer in taxes.
The net income will probably be
greater, however, on low-rate, non
taxable securities than it would be
on first class, absolutely safe secur
ities which also bear a low rate of
interest, if taxes had to be paid
thereon and deducted from the in
come received therefrom.
Third. If the amendment pass
es, the legislature is not compelled
to make any exemption. It is only
allowed to do so.
Fourth. Even if it should con
clude to do so. it is not compelled
to exempt all that it is allowed to
exempt. It may confine its ex
emption to as small a part of the
property as it may see lit.
Kifti-i. Should it pass a law
making any exemption whatever,
it cannot make it a permanent law.
The law can be repealed at any
time.
Sixth. If any exemption is
made, it is only on condition that
the University shall have free

tuition. In other words, that it
shall be a free school. It always
has had free tuition, and it always
will have.
The amendment may not be
adopted. If not, I feel a great mis
take will have been made. But in
any case, both you and 1 will feel |
that we labored in a good cause
and for the good of humanity, and
the blame will at least not rest up
on us for the failure.

greater, however, on low-rate, non
taxable securities than it would be
on first class, absolutely safe secur
ities which also bear a low rate of
interest, if taxes had to be paid
thereon and deducted from the in
come received therefrom.
Third. If the amendment pass
es, the legislature is not compelled
to make any exemption. It is only
allowed to do so.
Fourth. Even if it should con
clude to do so. it is not compelled
to exempt all that it is allowed to
exempt. It may confine its ex
emption to as small a part of the
property as it may see lit.
Kifti-i. Should it pass a law
making any exemption whatever,
it cannot make it a permanent law.
The law can be repealed at any
time.
Sixth. If any exemption is
made, it is only on condition that
the University shall have free

tuition. In other words, that it
shall be a free school. It always
has had free tuition, and it always
will have.
The amendment may not be
adopted. If not, I feel a great mis
take will have been made. But in
any case, both you and 1 will feel |
that we labored in a good cause
and for the good of humanity, and
the blame will at least not rest up
on us for the failure.

The Stanford. University Consti
tutional Amendment Club has been
formally organized, and is now pre
pared to start the campaign in fa
vor of the proposed amendment to
the State Constitution which is to
be voted on in November next.
The Constitutional Amendment
Club met in San Francisco last
Saturday and outlined its plan for
the coming campaign. Besides
Stanford alumni, who are of course
most vitally interested in the move
ment, the San Francisco branch of
the organization numbers among
its members and oflicers graduates
from the University of California.
Indeed, the plan is to attempt to
interest all parties and classes in
the success of the movement, so as
to make it an object for the general
welfare of the commonwealth. The
officers of the association are: H.
H. Brown, '90, president; Oscar
Sutro, U. C., '94, vice-president; L.
S. Beedy, '98, secretary-treasurer;
and an executive committee com
posed of Walter M. Rose, 95, Ar
chie Rice, '95, J. P. Bern hard, '96,
J. H. Timmons, '97, and James
Murphy, '98. It is the plan of the
Alumni Association, who are con
ducting the movement, to form
similar clubs throughout the State,
and to carry on the campaign re
gardless of party affiliations.
At the meeting last Saturday,
George Crothers, '95, who is at
present at the head of the move
ment, read a letter from S. K. Lieb
of San Jose, who is president of the
Board of Trustees of the University,
of which the following is a part:
George E. Crothers, Esq., Presi
dent of the Stanford Univer
sity Constitutional Amendment
Club.
Dear Silt: —In answer to your
favor of the 19th inst., asking me
to give my views as to the proposed
constitutional amendment which
relates to the Leland Stanford Jun
ior University, and which is to be
voted upon by the people of this
State at the general election in No
vember, 1 have this to Bay:
The act of the Legislature under
which the University was founded
and endowed was, unfortunately,
loosely drawn. The chief object
of the proposed constitutional
amendment is to remedy the de
fects of the legislative . act, and to
render futile any possible attempt
to disturb the validity of the large
endowments made for the benefit
of the University, and to make
this proposition so manifest that it
will probably prevent even an at
tempt to litigate the validity of
those endowments.
There is a matter, however, which
I think ought to be here mentioned.
J understand on the best of author
ity that a gentleman, resident of
another country, closely related to
the late Senator Stanford, and who,
like the late Senator, is without
immediate heirs, intends, if he can
legally do so, to leave by will al
most all of his vast estate to the
Leland Stanford Jr. University.
But the statute on which that
University was founded provides

that property may be given by
"grant" (no provision being made
for property left by will)] and pro
vides that such property so granted
shall be "any property, real or per
sonal, belonging to such person,
and situated or being within this
State.' 1 This would seem to pre
clude the University from receiving
any property not within the State.
The proposed constitutional amend
ment cures ihis defect, and also
provides that property may be
given to the University by will as
well as by yrant. I know of at
least one other person who is with
out immediate heirs, and who
would be glad to leave property to
the University by will who does
not like to part with it by grant
during his life. Doubtfess there
are still others similarly circum
stanced and of like mind.
It will be observed from the read
ing of this proposed amendment
that the following propositions are
true:
First. No real estate can be ex
empted from county or local taxes
except in the county ot Santa Cla
ra, where the University grounds
and buildings are situated. There
fore no county or city treasury can
be made poorer by reason of the
non-taxation of real estate except
ing only the county of Santa Clara,
and there only by the non-taxation
of the University lands on which are
the University buildings, and to this
limited exemption 1 feel sure a 1
great majority of the tax payers of
Santa Clara county will consent,
as their vote on this proposed con
stitutional amendment will un
doubtedly show.
Second. The provision that the
legislature may exempt personal
property can do no harm to the
State. The personal property of
the University will necessarily con
sist almost exclusively of approved
securities. If this amendment does
not pass, securities will necessarily,
as a business proposition, have to
be selected of a kind that are not
taxable. Securities of that class,
such as government bonds, always
bear a low rate of interest, and if
such low interest-bearing securities
are selected, the income of the Uni
versity will be much reduced and
its efficiency much impaired, and
the State be no richer in taxes.
The net income will probably be
greater, however, on low-rate, non
taxable securities than it would be
on first class, absolutely safe secur
ities which also bear a low rate of
interest, if taxes had to be paid
thereon and deducted from the in
come received therefrom.
Third. If the amendment pass

to make any exemption. It is only
