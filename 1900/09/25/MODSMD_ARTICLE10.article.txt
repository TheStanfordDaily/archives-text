# Golf Club Notes.
## 
### 
At the business meeting of the
Machrihanish Golf Club held last
Tuesday it was decided that the
annual dues be lixed at $3, pay
able within a month of the opening
of the semester. The course was
reported as in fair condition for
playing. Already the ground has
been cleared of tar-weed, and the
work of improving the links will
he pursued as far as the club's fi
nances will permit. It is proposed
to hold a tournament shortly and
the members are urged to turn out
for regular practice. A score of
47 was made twice during the last
week.
