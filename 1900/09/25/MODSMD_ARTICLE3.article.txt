# Coolidge to Make Collections.
## 
### 
Dane Coolidge, '98, left the Uni
versity today on a collecting trip
in Kern county, where he is com
missioned by the New York Zoolog
ical Society to secure upwards of
fifty rodents of different species, to
be shipped alive back to the park
in New York City. Among these
animals are included several squir
rels which are peculiar to the vicin
ity of Kern valley, notably the sil
ver-sided and golden-mantled
ground squirrels. Specimens of
these are few in Eastern collections.
Since his graduation, Coolidge
has spent a year in advanced work
at Harvard, and has since been
largely engaged in work along this
line, lie has but recently returned
from a very successful collecting
tour in southern Italy, in company
with John M. Oskison, '97, on be
half of the Smithsonian Institute
of Washington, D. C. This trip
brought him under the notice of
W. T. Horraday, the noted scientist
who is president of the New York
Society, and hence his present ex
pedition.
Upon his return to the Univer
sity, Coolidge expects to start to
the Lake Tahoe region in search of
small mammals which are found
in that localitv.
