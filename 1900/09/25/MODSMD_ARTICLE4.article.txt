# LAST NIGHT'S PRACTICE.
## Initial Line-up of the Varsity for Ten Minutes Brisk Play. 
### 
The practice last night waß a
most interesting one, inasmuch as
it was the first line-up of the Var
sity players. The first part of the
hour was taken up with signal
practice, and then, for about ten
minutes, the men were given a
taste of line smashing.
A number of last year's Varsity
were lined up, and every man was
in the play. The second eleven
was, of course, not so strong, but
gave their opponents a stiff game.
There is a notable and encouraging
tendency among the men this year
to play a fast and furious game,
and in this regard last night's
work was very good for so early in
the season.
The second kicked off, and the
Varsity with a series of fierce bucks
and rushes pushed the ball across
for a touchdown. Following is the
line-up:
