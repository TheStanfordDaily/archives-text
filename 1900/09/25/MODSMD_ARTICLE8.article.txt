Tomorrow evening the time ex
pires in which voters who wish to
he eligible to vote in November
may register. Now there are many
students in the University who are
eligible to vote, providing they
have registered. A few students
have been public spirited enough
to secure their electoral privilege
and an attempt has been made to
register as many as possible. Mow
ever, there are still doubtless a
large number of students who can
vote provided they register by to
morrow night. The registration
officials are willing to do all in
their power in the attempt to get
students to register and have done
much, but it is impossible to go
around among the students and
find out accurately who are eligible
for registration. Students should
regard this matter in its true im
portance and register before it is
too late. This is an important
election, as principles of moment
are involved, and every student no
matter what his political affili
ations should not neglect the op
portunity of taking a stand on the
issues before us. There is no time
to lose. Register before it is too
late, if you wish to vote.
