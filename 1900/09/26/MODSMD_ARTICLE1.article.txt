# MASS MEETING.
## Amendment Club Calls for a Student Body Meeting in the Chapel Tomorrow. 
### 
In pursuance of the policy of the
alumni in making the people of
the State thoroughly acquainted
with the details of the proposed
amendment, they have made prep
arations for a meeting of the stu
dents for tomorrow afternoon at
1:30 in the chapel. Frank V.
Keesling, '98, of San Francisco,
who is one of the prime movers for
the amendment, is on the campus
arranging details for tomorrow's
meeting.
The meeting tomorrow afternoon
will be for the primary purpose of
making the students acquainted
with the provisions of the amend
ment in detail, and to explain the
plan of the Amendment Club so
that they may be in touch with its
work, and also to outline the pro
posed plan of action for the cam
paign.
Dr. Jordan will be the principal
speaker at tomorrow's meeting,
and everybody should come out to
hear him, as this will be the first
opportunity to hear him this year.
The Stanford University Consti
tutional Amendment is to receive
active support during the present
campaign, and the alumni are
making extensive preparations to
place the proposed amendment be
fore the people of the State. The
passage of this amendment means
much to Stanford and everything
is being done to ensure its final
success. Yesterda}' The Daily
Palo Alto published an account of
the meeting in the city, with ex
tracts from the letter of S. F. Leib,
president of the Board of Trustees.
Besides Dr. Jordan some mem
ber of the Faculty Committee will
explain the provisions of the pro
posed amendment in detail. There
will be speeches also by other mem
bers of the faculty, alumni, and
students.
A Constitutional Amendment
Club will be formed here and
permanent officers will be elected.
There is much work for the local
club to do and it is desired to get
well under way as soon as possible.
The part of the meeting that will
probably bring forth the best re
sults is the plan to form local
clubs. After the meeting, the stu
dents from the different localities
throughout the State will meet and
form themselves into clubs for the
purpose of doing missionary work
in their own communities. There
are many students here who have
considerable influence in their own
locality, and it is planned to enlist
the interest of these students in
order that they be able to aid the
Amendment Club in its efforts.
This plan was tried two years
ago when the amendment was
passed through the legislature, and
met with great success. The stu
dents were divided into clubs, ac
cording to locality, and did much
active work in stirring up public
sentiment in favor of the amend
ment. Judging from its success
then, there can be no doubt that it
will be of much value this year.
It is desired that the different
instructors will make due an

nouncement of this meeting to
their classes tomorrow morning.
