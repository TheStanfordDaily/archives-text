The Stallard prize competition
offered last year for the best essay
on the principles set forth by the
Declaration of Independence closes
in a very few days. So far seem
ingly the competition has attracted
very little attention and seems to
have dropped out of general notice.
The good showing made last year
in the Cosmopolitan prize competi
tion raised the hope that renewed
interest would be taken in such
competitions and that more of
them would be offered. There
have been very few prizes offered
of late at the University, and those
that have been offered have met
with a response from but few. A
good many are opposed to the
principle of offering prizes for
special competitions as interfering
with regular University work
Still it seems that they are a good
thing and should be encouraged.
However, if the student body at
large do not take sufficient interest
in them to make the competition
interesting there is not much use
in encouraging them. It is to be
hoped that a large number of es
says are handed in by October
first in order to make the event
one of general interest.
