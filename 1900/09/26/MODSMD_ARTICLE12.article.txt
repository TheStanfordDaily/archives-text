Much dissatisfaction has been
shown lately regarding the hour
usually chosen for holding class
meetings. With the exception of
the noon hour, there is no time of
the day from 8:15 to 4:80 that is
free from University work, conse
quently class meetings held within
that time are sure to conflict with
recitations or laboratory work. Jn
many Eastern colleges an hour is
set apart in the schedule for such
purposes, as free lectures, class or
student body meeting, and other
general gatherings, but as no such
provision is made at Stanford, it
would seem advisable if class offi
cer should call meetings to take
place at 4:30 instead of 1:30.
Class men are compelled to be ab
sent from these meetings, and as
class spirit is none too strong at
Stanford, everything possible should
be done to strengthen it. Except
at a class election, or at meetings
where matters of first importance
to the class are to be decided, it is
always very difficult to secure a
quorum for the transaction of busi
ness. In fact many classes have
transacted important business at
meetings where there has been less
than the required number. How
ever, at 4:30 the University is over
for the day, every one is free, and
there is no reason why class meet
ings held at that hour should
not attract a larger per cent of
the class members than at any
other time. If class meetings were
held at an hour that everybody
could attend, then there would be
more interest shown in the meet
ings and in the general welfare of
the class. Well attended meetings
tend to develop closer relations be
tween class members, and to foster
that class spirit so lacking at Stan
ford. If this plan can produce any
better results, it is sit least worthy
of a trial.
