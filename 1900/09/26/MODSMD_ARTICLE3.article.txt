# UNABLE TO SCORE.
## Freshmen Not Up to Form and Palo Alto High Plays Them a 0-0 Game. 
### 
The game yesterday between the
Freshmen and Palo Alto High
School resulted in a tie with no
score, but was not as good football
as the close result might indicate.
Palo Alto was in excellent form
and played a consistent game most
of the time, and at the end of the
first half was within a few yards of
a touchdown. The Freshmen had
their opponents in the same rela
tive position earlier in the game,
but were prevented from scoring by
Palo Alto's securing the ball and
punting out of danger, then recov
ering the ball when Taylor failed
to catch it.
None of the Freshmen seemed to
be up to their form of last Satur
day, and they lacked their accus
tomed dash. Lunt was the only
man who played a particularly
brilliant game. He was aggressive
and used his head well, getting into
every play. Taylor was not up to
form, nor was Wiggins. Stanford
and Bonnbach both played a con
sistent game. Patterson's recovery
of a punt and darting away with
the ball for a long end run was a
good bit of football.
For Palo Alto, W. Taylor, P.
Tarpey, and Wiley played the best
individual giime. The High School
team showed the good effects of
Chet Murphy's coaching. Follow

After the Freshman game, the
Varsity men were out for a short
practice. The men are rapidly
getting into better form, and speed
and accuracy in handling the ball
show where careful coaching and
training are telling. Coach Yost
is more than pleased with the form
the men are developing, and thinks
that with as willing a squad as he
has at present wonders can be
accomplished in the way of team
work and general play. The Var
sity plays its first game next Sat
urday, against the Reliance team
of Oakland, and a good sized crowd
should be on the bleachers. The
game will be a good one, for the
Reliance men are all experienced
in the game, being either former
college men or old athletic club
players. It will afford an excellent
opportunity for sizing up our own
men and for getting a line on what
may be expected of them when
they have seen a season's practice.
