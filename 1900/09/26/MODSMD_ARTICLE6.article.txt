### 
This present campaign has seen
the advent of several of the Stan
ford alumni in the arena of poli
tics. The County Republican and
Democratic Conventions that met
Monday in San Francisco placed
in nomination for Assemblyman in
the 40th district Hamilton A.
Bauer, Economics, '99, on the Re
publican ticket, and S. P. Elias,
'99, on the Democratic. This pre
sents the unique spectacle of two
Stanford men, members of the
same class, contesting for the same
office. James Murphy, Law, '98,
is a candidate for Justice of the
Peace for the city of San Francisco
on the Democratic ticket. At the
Democratic County Convention
held Monday in San Jose, Frank
1). Wills, '99, received the nomina
tion for Assemblyman from this
district. Since graduation Wills
has been acting as secretary for
Contractor McGilvray. He is pop
ular in this end of the county and
will doubtless pull a strong vote.
Besides these, B. F. Bledsoe, '96,
who was a prominent Varsity de
bater while in college, is a candi
date for Superior Judge of San
Bernardino county, where he is at
present practicing law.
