# CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT CLUB.
## A 						Very Enthusiastic Meeting Held in the Chapel This Afternoon. 
### 
The meeting of the student body,
called for this afternoon by the
Stanford University Amendment
Club, was well attended and very
enthusiastic. It was preceded
with the Stanford and other col
lege yells. Dr. Jordan called the
meeting to order and spoke as fol
lows:
"This meeting is called to order
to elect officers and to solicit the
support of all voters and Stanford
students to gain votes for the
amendment. The University can
get out of taxation by buying non
taxable bonds, but they would bear
a low rate of interest, such as gov
ernment bonds. The grant was
not well drawn up. The statute
on which the University was
founded does not allow any one to
leave property to the University
except by grant. No property can
be left by will, if any one objects,
and it is quite likely that some
one would. The University can
not hold property outside of the
State. The object of the club and
of this amendment is to correct
this. The State legislature is al
lowed to exempt real estate and
personal property from taxation
by this amendment. Other State
legislatures are already possessed
of this power. Stanford is the
only institution of its rank which
pays taxes. In France such a
University is considered an in
stitution of public utility.
" There are two documents on
the amendment. The first is by
George E. Crothers, president of
organization. The second is by
Hon. S. F. Lieb, president of the
Board of Trustees, prefixed by a
paragraph by Crothers. All stu
dents should obtain these pam
phlets, read them, and then send
them to voters at their homes.
" We want all who can vote for
the amendment to do so, others to
get all the votes for it they can.
Any student ought to control at
least live votes for it, and by hard
work many can gain five hundred.
There is no direct opposition. One
indirect opposition is that the
property would be exempt from
taxation. Another is that the
amendment does not go far enough.
This amendment cannot include
other institutions, but a separate
amendment must be introduced for
them."
He introduced George E. Croth
ers, History, '95, president of the
organization formed two years ago,
who said:
''The document which I have
written covers all I care to say, as
suming that you will all read it,
and that of Mr. Lieb. They will
be placed in Encina and Roble
Halls, and if possible in the Regis
trar's office.
"The first point to be made
is that this is not a tax exemption
movement. The public considers
it as such. One great difficulty to
be encountered is that many people
do not vote for amendments. There
is no direct opposition to it. 1 fig
ured out just what the taxation of

the property was, at the time that
thin amendment was introduced in
the legislature, for my own satis
faction and that of my friends. It
was at that time about $10, GOO.
Today it is increased to probably
$15,000. The legislature is not re
quired to exempt that from taxa
tion. The portion which permits
the University to receive property
left by will is of far greater import
ance than the exemption of the
property from taxation. The pub
lic generally does not know that
there are any clauses which are of
vital importance to the University.
Students who know any one not un
derstanding this can gain his vote
by explaining the amendment to
him. There are only three States
which do not exempt the universi
ties from taxation. These three
are States in the Rocky Mountains
and have no universities. The
University is not going into poli
tics, but the students themselves
should pass this amendment. The
students can do it all and the Uni
versity nothing. The first purpose
is to confirm the founding of the
University and to put it on a firm
basis. Jt is the duty of all to read
the amendment or at least an arti
cle on it which explains its terms.
If we emphasize the clause on taxa
tion it will do more harm than
good."
Professor Whittier then made a
few remarks, in which he said that
many alumni and students whom
he knew had been doing good work.
All students should organize and
help the cause along.
Mr. Crothers then spoke as fol
lows: "We must do an immense
amount of correspondence, and
should organize into clubs contain
ing two or three counties. We only
need 80,000 votes to carry the
amendment. We should raise
funds for our own work. The Uni
versity should supply none of the
money. 1 would suggest that a
small assessment be levied on all
students and ex-students to bear
the expenses."
The officers of the organization
formed two years ago were unani
mously re-elected. They are as
follows: President, George E. Croth
ers, '95; secretary, J. F. Sheehan,
Jr., '95; executive committee, F. V.
Keesling, '98, Professor C. B. Whit
tier, '94, J. R. Hamilton,'ol, Frank
Adams, '01, Edwin Ilea, '95, Chas.
K. Field, '95. Upon motion of
Sheehan, Erb, '01, and Maples, '01,
were added to the executive com
mittee. The office of vice-president
was created and Professor Charles
R. Lewers elected to it.
The meeting was then divided in
to counties and each proceeded to
electa chairman. The chairmen
were instructed to fill out lists of
students from their counties who
are willing to work in the interest
of the amendment. A meeting of
them will be called by the ex
ecutive committee before long, and
every list should then be complete.

the property was, at the time that
thin amendment was introduced in
the legislature, for my own satis
faction and that of my friends. It
was at that time about $10, GOO.
Today it is increased to probably
$15,000. The legislature is not re
quired to exempt that from taxa
tion. The portion which permits
the University to receive property
left by will is of far greater import
ance than the exemption of the
property from taxation. The pub
lic generally does not know that
there are any clauses which are of
vital importance to the University.
Students who know any one not un
derstanding this can gain his vote
by explaining the amendment to
him. There are only three States
which do not exempt the universi
ties from taxation. These three
are States in the Rocky Mountains
and have no universities. The
University is not going into poli
tics, but the students themselves
should pass this amendment. The
students can do it all and the Uni
versity nothing. The first purpose
is to confirm the founding of the
University and to put it on a firm
basis. Jt is the duty of all to read
the amendment or at least an arti
cle on it which explains its terms.
If we emphasize the clause on taxa
tion it will do more harm than
good."
Professor Whittier then made a
few remarks, in which he said that
many alumni and students whom
he knew had been doing good work.
All students should organize and
help the cause along.
Mr. Crothers then spoke as fol
lows: "We must do an immense
amount of correspondence, and
should organize into clubs contain
ing two or three counties. We only
need 80,000 votes to carry the
amendment. We should raise
funds for our own work. The Uni
versity should supply none of the
money. 1 would suggest that a
small assessment be levied on all
students and ex-students to bear
the expenses."
The officers of the organization
formed two years ago were unani
mously re-elected. They are as
follows: President, George E. Croth
ers, '95; secretary, J. F. Sheehan,
Jr., '95; executive committee, F. V.
Keesling, '98, Professor C. B. Whit
tier, '94, J. R. Hamilton,'ol, Frank
Adams, '01, Edwin Ilea, '95, Chas.
K. Field, '95. Upon motion of
Sheehan, Erb, '01, and Maples, '01,
were added to the executive com
mittee. The office of vice-president
was created and Professor Charles
R. Lewers elected to it.
The meeting was then divided in
to counties and each proceeded to
electa chairman. The chairmen
were instructed to fill out lists of
students from their counties who
are willing to work in the interest
of the amendment. A meeting of
them will be called by the ex
ecutive committee before long, and
every list should then be complete.
The meeting of the student body,
called for this afternoon by the
Stanford University Amendment
Club, was well attended and very
enthusiastic. It was preceded
with the Stanford and other col
lege yells. Dr. Jordan called the
meeting to order and spoke as fol
lows:
"This meeting is called to order
to elect officers and to solicit the
support of all voters and Stanford
students to gain votes for the
amendment. The University can
get out of taxation by buying non
taxable bonds, but they would bear
a low rate of interest, such as gov
ernment bonds. The grant was
not well drawn up. The statute
on which the University was
founded does not allow any one to
leave property to the University
except by grant. No property can
be left by will, if any one objects,
and it is quite likely that some
one would. The University can
not hold property outside of the
State. The object of the club and
of this amendment is to correct
this. The State legislature is al
lowed to exempt real estate and
personal property from taxation
by this amendment. Other State
legislatures are already possessed
of this power. Stanford is the
only institution of its rank which
pays taxes. In France such a
University is considered an in
stitution of public utility.
" There are two documents on
the amendment. The first is by
George E. Crothers, president of
organization. The second is by
Hon. S. F. Lieb, president of the
Board of Trustees, prefixed by a
paragraph by Crothers. All stu
dents should obtain these pam
phlets, read them, and then send
them to voters at their homes.
" We want all who can vote for
the amendment to do so, others to
get all the votes for it they can.
Any student ought to control at
least live votes for it, and by hard
work many can gain five hundred.
There is no direct opposition. One
indirect opposition is that the
property would be exempt from
taxation. Another is that the
amendment does not go far enough.
This amendment cannot include
other institutions, but a separate
amendment must be introduced for
them."
He introduced George E. Croth
ers, History, '95, president of the
organization formed two years ago,
who said:
''The document which I have
written covers all I care to say, as
suming that you will all read it,
and that of Mr. Lieb. They will
be placed in Encina and Roble
Halls, and if possible in the Regis
trar's office.
"The first point to be made
is that this is not a tax exemption
movement. The public considers
it as such. One great difficulty to
be encountered is that many people
do not vote for amendments. There
is no direct opposition to it. 1 fig
ured out just what the taxation of

the property was, at the time that
