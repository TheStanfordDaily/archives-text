It might be suggested to the
Junior Class, since they have be
gun to make preparations for their
Plug Ugly, that instead of holding
their ceremony in the open with
no price for admission they
hold it on the football field and
charge some nominal admission
price, in order to cover the expense
involved. It has been the experi
ence of the two former classes who
have inaugurated the ceremony
that the Plug Ugly has been a
source of expense, which coming
in a year when the class has so
much financial outlay to prepare
for, is apt to prove an embarrass
ment. Of course if the class does
not intend to plan for a ceremonial
like last year, with its costumes
and settings, the expense will be
slight, but if it follows the plan of
its predecessors and hopes to outdo
them, it can only do so at some
cost. The other classes tried the
experiment of selling programs to
cover the expense. Last year,
however, this was not a success,
not enough programs being sold
to cover cost of printing. It would
seem that if instead of selling pro
grams they should charge for ad
mission, and by holding it on the
football field, with the fence sur
rounding it, they can easily do so,
the ceremony would easily pay its
expenses. The Plug Ugly is a
great event and there are enough
people who are willing to pay
to see it. With an admission
price, there could then be an
opportunity for the class to
plan a more elaborate ceremonial
than ordinarily, without the risk
of incurring a heavy debt. The
plan is very feasible and is worthy
of consideration by the committee
in charge.
