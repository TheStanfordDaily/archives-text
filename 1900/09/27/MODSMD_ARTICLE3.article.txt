## Last Night's Practiceâ€”Keen Competition for Places Promises Good Results. 
### 
The large crowd which turned .
out to witness the football practice |
last night had no reason to be dis- j
appointed. The Varsity lined up
early against the second eleven ,
and botl> teams played very good
ball. The Varsity succeeded in
making one touchdown.
The form the men are showing |
is very good for this time of the
season and the fast, snappy game
they play is indeed creditable.
Some hard practicing must be done
between now and Saturday's game,
and the men are apparently realiz
ing this fact, as they are displaying
an earnestness of purpose which is
bound to bring good results.
The last year's Varsity men are
nearly all showing up well, but
the keen competition that is going
on makes no man sure of his place.
This is particularly true of the
backs and end positions, where a
number of good men are trying;
for each one.
What the outcome of all this
competition will be, it is of course
impossible to even guess with any
degree of accuracy, but it is safe to
say that with the struggle for places
that is now going on, the man who
comes out hist best must play some
very good football.
Of the men who were conspicu
ous for good work last night, Seeley
is one of the most promising men
in the squad. He smashed the line
repeatedly for big gains and never
failed to get into the play. Ward
all is putting up a good game at
end, as is Boren also. Raitt at
quarter did good work last night.
Following is the line-up:
SECOND. VARSITY.
Wardall 1 e r Boren
Thomson 1 t r Burnett
Knight 1 g r Seeley
Gregory c Lee
Nutter r g 1 DeForest
Bidwell r t 1 Traeger
Nourse r e I Caglieri
Luck q Raitt
Hill 1 hr Fisher
Allen r h 1 Smith
Roberts 112 Slaker
The first Varsity game of the sea
son, which is scheduled for next
Saturday, promises to be a good ex
hibition of football. The Reliance
men will be in better form than
when they played Santa Clara a
week ago, as they have had enough
practice to improve them very
much. The Varsity line-up will
be announced tomorrow. It is
hoped that a large crowd will turn
out to encourage the men in the
first game of the season.
