# ON THE GRIDIRON.
## The
						Week's Work in Footballâ€”The Freshmen Take a Slump. Tomorrow's Game. 
### 
The week's work in football has
on the whole been satisfactory to
the coaches. Of course, it is so
early in the season that nothing
definite can be told as to the final
results; now is the time of the ham
mer ing-into-shape process and every
practice is in the nature of a try
out. The match games will be
largely of this nature also, and it
is probable that the line-ups in the
first games will be changed quite
frequently to give untried material
a chance. This is absolutely
necessary, as Coach Yost proposes
to know just what every man who
wears a suit is good for.
The daily practices have all been
interesting and the new material
is all promising. Just now a great
deal of time is being given to the
Freshmen to get them in shape for
their game which comes now in
less than a month. After their
one-sided game with Hoitt's the
Freshmen seem inclined to take
things easily and this week has
seen a lamentable slump in their
play. It is to be hoped that it is
only temporary, however, and that
another week will find them in
form.
A vast amount of hard work is
in store for the Freshmen, and un
less a brace is taken very quickly
much valuable time may be lost.
Berkeley's freshman class this
year contains some exceptionally
good material, and for our lighter
team to equal California's is going
to require of the Freshmen some of
the hardest kind of work and most
conscientious training. Last night's
practice was given up largely to a
Freshman line-up, while the Var
sity was given signal practice and
punting.
Tomorrow the Varsity plays its
first match game this season,
against the Reliance team of Oak
land, on the campus. A large
crowd should turn out to the initial
football contest of the year, and by
its presence encourage the players.
The game promises to be a good
one, as the Reliance men are all
experienced players from college
and athletic club gridirons, and
may be expected to make things
interesting lor the Varsity. This
will also be the first opportunity of
sizing up our own material, part of
which is altogether new. The line
up will be changed at intervals
during the game, in accordance
with the coach's plan of giving as
many men as possible a chance.
Following is the original line-up:
Center, Lee; left guard, DeForest;
right guard, Seeley; left tackle,
Traeger; right tackle, Burnett; left
end, Thompson; right end, Cooper;
quarter, Raitt; left half, Smith;
right half, Fisher; fullback, Slaker,
The following men will probably
go into the game later: Boren,
Erb, Caglieri, Luck, Hill, Geisler,
Parker, Roberts, Allen, Bentley,
Emerson.
