There can be little doubt, judg
ing from the tone of the mass meet
ing yesterday, that the University
is faci question of serious mo
ment. If the magnificent en
dowment of the University is to
be imperiled by a defect in the Act
of Organization under which it
is chartered, and the unselfish de
votion of its founders who have
labored so lovingly for the up
building of this institution is
liable to be turned aside on techni
cal grounds, it behooves every stu
dent here to at once turn out and
do his best to see that the proposed
amendment passes this fall. The
success or failure of the proposed
constitutional amendment rests
wholly upon the alumni, students,
and friends of the University. For,
as has been pointed out, the Uni
versity not being in politics can
and must do but very little di
rectly for the amendment. Every
student who was not present at the
meeting yesterday should report at
once to the chairman of his county
organization and make plans at
once to stir up a favorable senti
ment in his community. Eighty
thousand votes can be raised if the
work is carried on as it should be,
ceaselessly and untiringly. The
object is one that should appeal to
every loyal Stanford student—to
secure to his Alma Mater that is
doing so much for him, the oppor

tunity of enjoying what is right
fully hers. The scheme, for those
students who can go to their homes
and try to work up public senti
ment in favor of the measure, is a
good one and should meet with
hearty response. There should be
a large number of speakers and
workers out all over the State.
Those of us who can not do active
work among the people of the State
can at least join their county or
ganization and do what they can
indirectly. Hand in your names
at once. Thorough organization
brings success.
