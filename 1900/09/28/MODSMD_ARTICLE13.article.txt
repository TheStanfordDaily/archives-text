### 
The committee in charge of the
exhibit department of the Agricul
tural Fair which will be held in
San Jose from October Bth to the
13th, inclusive, are working incess
antly, and it is now evident that
the display will be the finest ever
made by the farmers in this valley.
The display will consist of all kinds
of grains, fruits, nuts, vegetables,
and other farm products. The
numerous premiums that are of
fered are going to cause much com
petition among the exhibitors, and
many of the prominent farmers
and orchardists have made appli
cation for space.
Secretary H. H. Main reports
that applications are coming in
every day and the space that has
been set aside for these exhibits is
being rapidly taken, and within
the next few days all the room al
loted to the farmers will have been
secured.
