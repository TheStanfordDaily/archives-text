# STANFORD WINS.
## In the First Game of the Season the Varsity Beats Reliance, 6-0. 
### 
In the first football game of the
season, played Saturday on the
campus, the Varsity made a good
beginning by beating the Reliance
Athletic Club team with a score of
6 to 0. The day was hot and sul
try for football, but both teams
were full of spirit and were in the
game hard and fast from the start.
The Varsity played the faster game,
being in better condition than the
club men. Ab a whole the Stanford
game was a good one for so early
in the season, and any faults that
showed up in the play were such
as can be cured by practice.
For Stanford, Slaker, Fisher,
Seelev, and Raitt played the best
individual games, but every man
on the team did all that could rea
sonably be expected of him. See
ley's smashes through the Reliance
line were a feature of the day,
while Fisher did good work both
on the offensive and defensive.
Slaker gave an idea of what may
be expected of him in the future by
hammering the club line for big
gains whenever called upon.
Traeger's kick-off to Reliance's
ten-yard line was returned by Ro
dolph's punt to Raitt in the center
of the field and he carried back
ten. Stanford rushed to their op
ponents' twenty-yard line, where
Reliance received the ball on downs.
Rodolph tried a punt but lost
ground on a fumble. On a second
trial he kicked to Raitt, with a net
gain of thirty yards. Seeley went
through center for fifteen where
Stanford lost the ball on a fumble.
Rodolph again kicked, this time to
Slaker, who was downed before he
could run in. Seeley and Slaker
with a series of fierce bucks re
turned the pigskin into Reliance
territory and, Hill failing to make
his distance by a narrow margin,
the club men took the ball on
downs.
Reliance made their distance in
three smashes but soon lost the
ball on a fumble. Seeley went
through for ten and eight and
Fisher skirted the end for two. A
plunge by Slaker put the ball on
the club, twenty-yard line where it
was held and taken on downs by
the visitors. Rodolph's punt to
the center of the field was fumbled
by Slaker and Thierkauf fell on the
ball. Time for the first half was
called, with the ball near the center
of the field and in Reliance's pos
session.
In the second half Rodolph
kicked to Hill who ran it in to the
forty-yard line. Fisher, Traeger,
and Hill for five, two, and three
respectively put the ball in the cen
ter of the field. The Varsity
failed to make the required dis
tance and Fisher punted. Ro
dolph fumbled the kick and Cooper
recovered the ball on the club's
twenty-five-yard line. P'isher
placed the pigskin twelve yards
nearer the goal by a dash through
Hamilton. l)e Forest went through
center for two and Slaker put the
ball on the eight-yard line. See
ley went through Weir for a touch

down. Raitt kicked a difficult
goal. Score 6-0 in Stanford's
favor.
Reliance kicked off to Fisher and
with three tackle plays the ball was
on the forty-yard line. Slaker
made ten, but fumbled. Reliance's
ball. The athletic club by a series
of rushes put the pigskin on Stan
ford's twenty-yard line, where it
was taken from them on downs.
Fisher kicked and Traeger forced
Rod' lpli back live yards. Time
was called with the ball on Reli
ance's fifty-yard line. Following
is the line-up:

Reliance received the ball on downs.
Rodolph tried a punt but lost
ground on a fumble. On a second
trial he kicked to Raitt, with a net
gain of thirty yards. Seeley went
through center for fifteen where
Stanford lost the ball on a fumble.
Rodolph again kicked, this time to
Slaker, who was downed before he
could run in. Seeley and Slaker
with a series of fierce bucks re
turned the pigskin into Reliance
territory and, Hill failing to make
his distance by a narrow margin,
the club men took the ball on
downs.
Reliance made their distance in
three smashes but soon lost the
ball on a fumble. Seeley went
through for ten and eight and
Fisher skirted the end for two. A
plunge by Slaker put the ball on
the club, twenty-yard line where it
was held and taken on downs by
the visitors. Rodolph's punt to
the center of the field was fumbled
by Slaker and Thierkauf fell on the
ball. Time for the first half was
called, with the ball near the center
of the field and in Reliance's pos
session.
In the second half Rodolph
kicked to Hill who ran it in to the
forty-yard line. Fisher, Traeger,

Coach Yost expressed himself as
satisfied with the game. Itshowed
up some faults that need improve
ment, but on the whole the game
played by our team was a good one.
The numerous fumbles prevented a
larger score.
A pleasant feature of the after
noon was the appearance of "Tom
my" McFadden on the field. He
was Varsity end last year and re
turned to college last Saturday,
when there was some doubt as to
his being able to get here in time
to register before the time limit ex
pired. His appearance at the game
was the signal for an enthusiastic
demonstration by the bleachers, as
his return puts a decidedly differ
ent view on the contest for the end
positions.
