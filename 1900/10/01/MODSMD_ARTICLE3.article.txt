## Reverend F.L. Hosmer of Berkeley Speaks on the "Man in All Men" in the Chapel. 
### 
The Rev. F. L. Hosmer of Berke
ley delivered the sermon yesterday
morning in the chapel. His sub
ject, "The Man in All Men," was
based on the divine command,
"Honor all men." He said:
"The differences between men
are those which lie deeper than the
social ranks which we follow. There
are differences which we cannot
ignore. Even in the savage these
differences are to be seen. The ex
hortation to "honor all men" seems
in itself a disintegration of social
order. "All men" —this includes
mean men, brutish men, martyrs,
and the men who led them to the
stake. Are we to honor all those
who lessen the moral virtue of soci
ety? If so, on what basis? It is
evident it must be on some basis.
If this respect is to be universal, it
must rest upon some primary
grounds, something in human na
ture itself.
"It is the man in man, not what
you are or I am; it is the human
in us; it is the reverence in us for
human nature, as such I want to
consider this reverence. This
reverence is necessary to our faith.
Our interpretation of life, our
higher hopes and ideals depend on
it.
"All great faiths start from the
soul, from a sense of its inherent
dignities and possibilities. In con
sidering this reverence for human
nature we consider the recognition
of "man in all men." It is easy
to honor exceptional characters in
the men about us; all men do that.
However low, morally, one man
lives he respects the higher and bet
ter in others, in those whose lives
are simple and honest and sincere.
Even "bad" men do respect in
others that religion which shows
itself in a noble life and in kind
liness. Men take pleasure accord
ing to their power of seeing good
in others.
"As the Greek counted all who
were not Greeks barbarians, so we
are inclined to consider all those
not within the pale of our church
as lost. We need today a lift of
this partialism in religion up to
universal principles. We need a
recognition of virtue in Christians
or non-Christians, more recognition
of "man in all men" and of the
honest disciple of every faith; sup
pose the educated man saw in the
ignorant and illiterate the "man,"
would it not indicate his culture
and be that culture's crowning
glory? Suppose the rich man saw
in the poor man the real man be
hind the poverty, would it not cor
rect that peacock pride and give
more of real man- and womanhood?
" All truth has at last its bearing
on human truth and human life.
Every moral problem becomes to
each man his problem. All things
of much account do and have cost.
How much has the progress of his
tory cost some lives! The problem
is yours and mine. The interchange
of service is mutual relationship.
Suppose in all things each one saw
in the other the man, recognized

and honored it, would not this lift
the human standard? Will you as
a man draw the broidered mantle
of your assumed culture about you
to protect you from the dead level
and commonplace of society? The
higher life is lived from principles
which are easily applied as cases
occur and conduct requires. We
must putin our actions the real
courtesy of the heart. We must
make charity seem to be what we
are, not what we tjive. This recog
nition of man in men will make
visible to us in every upturned face
the visage of the Child, of the Son
of God."
