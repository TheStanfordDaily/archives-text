The scarcity of chairs in the
larger Engineering building is a
source of great annoyance to those
who have classes in certain of the
rooms. Often a room which is to
he occupied by a class of twenty or
thirty will be at the beginning of
an hour entirely barren of chairs.
When seats are found by the early
arrivals the class is interrupted for
several minutes by the entrance of
scouting parties from different
parts of the building. It is not
only inconvenient to those who
have to find the chairs, but also
disturbing to the classes from which
the chairs are taken and to the
ones in which they are used.
