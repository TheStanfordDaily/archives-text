Since the Freshmen have had
sufficient courage to invest in a
large quantity of paint and have
dared to creep out at night to daub
their class numerals on every avail
able space on the campus, it is
time to call a halt. The custom of
painting class numerals was much
in vogue during the pioneer days,
but of late, owing to its being
frowned upon, it has gone out of
fashion somewhat. However, the
backstop has been held sacred, and
Freshmen are not considered to be
in evidence until their numerals
are painted thereon. Of course the
new fence was a temptation no
Freshman could resist. But there
was no need of painting a string of
class numerals all the way around
it simply because it was new. On
several previous occasions the Uni
versity authorities have been
obliged to repaint University prop
erty, only to find it disfigured with
numerals the next day. The fence
belongs to the student body, but
that is no reason why it should be
made an eye-sore to the community.
In the old days a deed like that of
Friday night was used as an in
centive to a rush, but now that
rushing has been done away with
it is of no value except as a bit of
foolish vainglory 011 the part of the

Freshman who did not know any
better. It is to be hoped that the
supply of paint has 1 not given out,
as there are still a few desirable
places left from which class numer
als would show off to advantage.
