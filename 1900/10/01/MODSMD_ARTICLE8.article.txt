# San Jose's Fair.
## 
### 
October 11th the Varsity will
meet the San Jose State Normal at
the fair grounds in San Jose. This
game will be held during the week
of the Santa Clara Valley Agricul
tural Society's great fair, which
takes place in San Jose, October
Bth to 13th. It is planned to make
this day strictly a Stanford day,
and, if possible, to run a special
excursion down to San Jose for the
occasion. Besides the football game,
Secretary Main has planned for
many other interesting and attrac
tive events. One day of the fair
will be Spanish day.and will be
given over to the old Spanish
sports, including a barbecue and
bull-fight. There will be a mag
nificent list of vaudeville attrac
tions grouped together in a mighty
midway that will be positively free.
This fair will lie without doubt the
greatest ever held in San Jose.
