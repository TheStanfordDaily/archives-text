# FOOTBALL AFFAIRS.
## Good Work Done in Last Night's Practice.â€” Training Table Begins Thursday. 
### 
Football practice last night was
the usual thing of signal practice
and short line-ups of 'Freshmen
and Varsity. Saturday's game
showed up some weak points in the
play and Coach Yost is beginning
at once to remedy these defects as
rapidly as possible.
The Varsity lined up for about
twenty minutes against the second
eleven and succeeded in making
two touchdowns. In some respects,
particularly in interference and
blocking, the work done last night
was the prettiest seen this season.
The men are beginning to run the
interference much more rapidly
and to use their heads a little more
than formerly in blocking tackles.
Following is the line-up:
VARSITY. SECOND.
Allen 1 e r Nourse
Traeger 1 t r . . Hauverman
Emerson 1 g r Jacobs
Lee c Gregory
Seeley r g 1 Thompson
Bentley r t 1 Nutter
Cooper r e 1 Wardall
Raitt q Luck
Hill 1 hr Parker
Smith '..rh 1 Knight
Slaker 112 Roberts
Coach Yost deems it advisable to
start the training table very short
ly, and arrangements have accord
ingly been made by the manage
ment with the University Inn for a
regular table for ihe football men.
About fifteen men, who have shown
up best in the practices, will go on
the table for the present, but others
will be added as they develop into
more promising form. The table
will begin Thursday with the fol
lowing men: Lee, Burnett, Seeley,
de Forest, Traeger, Raitt, Hill,
Fisher, Slaker, Erb, Allen, Cooper,
Geissler, Smith, and T. McFadden.
