Complaint has been made that
the women of the Freshman Class
seem to he deplorably deficient in
any interest in debating, and that
they have not attended any of the
meetings of the new Freshman De
bating Society.
Now this is all wrong. The wom
en of the University should take as
much interest in debating as men.
That they have made as good de
baters, our records will plainly
show. For on several memorable
occasions when Stanford has won,
a woman has been a member of the
team. In the face of these facts,
there should be no reason why the
meeting of the Freshman Society
tomorrow night should not have a
fair representation of the feminine
members of 1904.
