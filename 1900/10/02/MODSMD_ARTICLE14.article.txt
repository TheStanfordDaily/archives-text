Attention is called to the an
nouncement for the Carnot prelim
inaries. The contestants for this
event are asked to hand in their
names by Friday. There is no rea
son why there should not he a
large number of contestants for this
debate. Our system of picking the
various debating teams through a
series of preliminary debates has
proven satisfactory so far. A large
number of contestants have ap
peared for each try-out, and in
most instances the team has been
in doubt to the last. This year the
announcement for the prelimina
ries is issued a little late, but every
one who has any aspirations in the
line of debating should hand in
his name to the committee in order
to make the list of contestants as
large as possible. Taking part in
these preliminaries will prove of
valuable assistance to any speaker,
and it serves the double purpose of
bringing out new material and aid
ing in the development of the pres
ent debaters. Any one thinking of
entering the preliminaries should
not put off handing in his name,
but should do it now ere it is too
late and the list of entries is com
plete.
