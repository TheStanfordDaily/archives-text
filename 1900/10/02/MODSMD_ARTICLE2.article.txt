# Meet at Tanforan.
## 
### 
Last Saturday's meet at Tan
foran was very successful. In all
the events run off there was close
rivalry and in three of them Coast
records were lowered. Compared
to other teams Stanford made a
a poor showing in the number of
men entered, due in great measure
to our system of training, few of
the men being in condition.
The best work of any of the
Stanford men was that of Dole, '08,
who surpassed himself in the high
jump with a handicap of five
inches. He easily won first place
with 6 feet, H inches.
The Stanford men who won
places in the other events were:
Lamb, '03, third in the 100-yard
scratch race, and fourth in the 100-
yard handicap; Davis, '03, third
in the quarter-mile handicap; Dole,
'03, third in the pole-vault; and
Wardall, '01, third in the hammer
throw. By points, the Olympic
Club was first, University of Cali
fornia second, Stanford third,
Academic League fourth, and
Y. M. C. A. fifth.
California's stars were Service,
Drum, and Hoffman, each of whom
broke Coast records. In the <HBO
Service ran a magnificent race,

beating out Smith, '99, and win
ning finely in 1:50 2-5. Drum
broke the Coast record for the 220
yard dash in 22 3-5 seconds. In
the pole-vault Hoffman divided the
honors with Cutter of the Olympic
Club by clearing the bar at 11 feet,
inches, setting a mark that will
in all probability remain for some
time.
