# Electricity from Redwood.
## 
### 
A contract has been made lately
between the University authorities
and the Consolidated Light and
Power Company of Redwood City,
by which the party of the second
part elects to furnish all the elec
tricity used at the University.
This not only includes the lighting
of the buildings, but also power for
operating the workshop, foundry,
water pumps, and winery.
Since the last semester the Red
wood company has been supplying
power for 800 lamps for the faculty
and fraternity houses on the cam
pus. With the advent of more
houses and new quad buildings the
University power house would have
to l>e greatly augmented in order
to generate current for the new
needs. . It was found more econom
ical to get power from abroad than
manufacture it here, so the con
tract was closed. It calls for 5,000
additional lamps and 75 horse
power for motors.
This new arrangement will cause
a shut-down of the power-house
and the engine and boiler will be
run only to supply steam heat.
