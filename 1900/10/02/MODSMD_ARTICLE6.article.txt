# CULVER'S CLEVER CARTOON.
## A 						Stanford Man Makes a Great Hit With a Political Drawing. 
### 
K. K. Culver, '99, who has been
the cartoonist on the of the
boa Angeles Herald for the past
three months, lias recently drawn
a political cartoon which is at
tracting a great deal of attention
and will be used by the Republi
can National Committee during the
campaign in all of the newspaper
material sent out by the commit
tee from now until election day, as
well as by 5,000 newspapers.
This clever cartoon represents
Uncle Sam, his face spread with a
broad and knowing grin, holding
up a long sheet of paper, about
half of which is covered with the
following figures: U. S. Census Re
port â€”1880, 50,155,183; 1890, 62,-
622,250; 1900, 71,000,000. Un
derneath are written the words:
"Jt sort o' looks as if I'd have to
expand."
This drawing since it was first
published in the Sunday Herald,
September 9th, has been selected
from thousands of cartoons which
have been and are constantly pour
ing in at headquarters, as the only
one wholly adapted to'the needs of
the literary bureau in its news
paper service. In the Herald, Sep
tember 26th, an editorial entitled
"The Cartoon of the Campaign,"
characterized Culver's drawing as
"the signal success achieved by a
staff artist, conveying an inval
uable lesson of the campaign," and
in regard to the committee's accept
ance of the cartoon, "a distinction
of which the Herald and its artist
may properly feel proud."
"Dick" Culver has had consider
able experience in newspaper
work. For several months he was
engaged on the San Francisco Call,
and during the past year his draw
ings and cartoons have appeared
frequently in Life, Judge, and Puck.
