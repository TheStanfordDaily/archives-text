# ON THE GRIDIRON.
## Freshmen Out of Their Slump and Varsity Gradually Improving. 
### 
The muddy Held last night made
the football practice a trifle slower
than usual, but nevertheless both
the Freshman and Varfity line-ups
were interesting football. The
Freshmen were given signal prac
tice and a little preliminary coach
ing by I'rofessor Lewers and u Doc"
Murphy, and were lined up for
twenty minutes. They played
snappy ball and seem to be recov
ering from their slump of last
week. Their next game is sched
uled for Saturday afternoon on the
campus, when they play the Mount
Tamalpais team. Following is last
night's Freshman line-up:
FRESHMAN. SECOND.
Clark 1 e r Scoville
Lunt.. . 1 t r Wooley
McFadden 1 g r Merrill
Gregory c Burton
Frederickson .. r g 1 Shields
Maples r t 1 Dickson
Patterson r e I Lemmon
Bansbach q Beebe
Taylor r h 1 Davis
Stanford 1 hr Anthony
McGilvary 112 Grant
The Varsity line-up which fol
lowed showed a great many changes
in positions and a little raggedness
resulted from the shifting about.
Fisher and Seele}' for the first
eleven did some excellent work, in
spite of the Hlippery field, and for
the second, Erb, Parker, and Sy
monds carried off the honors, Sy
monds showing up particularly at
tackling and general quickness of
his work. The general trouble with
the men of the second, with a few
notable exceptions, is that they
seem to take it for granted that the
Varsity squad can outplay them,
which results in half-hearted play
ing in the line. On the first team
there is, as yet, an unevenness in
the interference, due to the fact that
the backs, Fisher and Slaker, are
too fast for the rest. This is a
fault that can be corrected readily
when the coach turns his attention
to drilling the backs alone in the
finer points. Hill's work is marked
by a seeming inability to realize
that a straight line marks the
shortest distance between two
points. His great fault, as exem
plified in the Reliance game, is
that of making long runs across
the field at a danger of losing
ground by being forced back. On
the whole the men showed great
improvement in dodging on run
ning the ball in from kicks. A
lack of aggressiveness in the line
men, particularly as noted in the
second team, results in slowness of
play and no attempts to break
through to get the man with the
ball behind the line.
VARSITY. SECOND.
Allen 1 e r Symonds
Traeger 1 t r Lowenthal

In last night's practice the Var
sity succeeded in scoring two touch
downs against the second in the
twenty minutes of play.
The game scheduled for Satur
day, October 6th, between the
Varsity and Santa Clara College
has been declared off as the latter
team has cancelled its dates and
the Varsity will be unable to meet
them this season unless some new
arrangements are made. Thursday
afternoon, October 11th, the Var
sity meets the San Jose Normal in
San Jose.
