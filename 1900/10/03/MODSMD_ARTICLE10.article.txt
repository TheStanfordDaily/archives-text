# San Jose's Great Fair.
## 
### 
At the Sati Jose Agricultural So
ciety's meeting next week it is safe
to assume that among the main
events of interest for Stanford peo
ple will be the football game sche
duled for Thursday, the 11th, which
is registered as Stanford day. That
a large attendance from this sec
tion will be in evidence on that
date goes without saying. Next in
interest to the game between the
Varsity and the San Jose Normal
will be Children's day on Friday,
the 12th, when it is arranged to
have 20,000 school children take
part in the parade. Polo, bull
fights, a barbecue, balloon ascen
sions, and other attractions without
limit will delight all attendants.
Apply to Secretary Main for par
ticulars.
