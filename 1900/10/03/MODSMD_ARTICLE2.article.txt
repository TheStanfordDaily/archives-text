The directors of the Women's
Athletic Association met at the
Roble gymnasium Monday after
noon for the purpose of tilling a
vacancy on the board caused by
the absence of Miss Christina Rose,

Miss May Kimble was elected to
the position without opposition.

The appointment of committee's

The appointment of a committee
on basket-ball was postponed until
the next meeting of the directors,
which will be called b}' the presi
dent, Miss Maud March, some
time at the end of this month.
From statements grounded on
knowledge there are brilliant pros
pects for an excellent basket-ball
team this year, some very excel
lent material having come to Stan
ford from other colleges in the
East. The plan of organizing
teams among the girls of the
various halls and sorority houses
is meeting with enthusiastic ap
proval and furthermore it is
thought that these teams when or
ganized will enter the field for con
tests among themselves and thus a
livelier interest in athletics be
awakened among the women of
the University. It is to be noticed
also that all women students who
have paid the student body fee are
members of the association and
eligible to all its privileges.
