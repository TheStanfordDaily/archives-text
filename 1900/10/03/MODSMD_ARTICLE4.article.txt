# THE 						ORIENTAL QUESTION.
## President Jordan Discusses the Question of China's Dismemberment 
### 
The announcement that Dr. Jor
dan was going to speak last night
on the Chinese question attracted a
large crowd to the Assembly Hall,
as it was the tirst chance of the
year for the students to hear I*resi
dent Jordan. He announced that
contrary to his usual custom he
would omit the annual talk to the
Freshmen that has always been a
feature of the opening of the college
year, and instead prefaced the lec
ture with a little advice to the new
students.
Dr. Jordan has never seen China;
he has simply looked over the fence
from her neighbor's garden. Japan
ese scholars and newspapers are
his source of information concern
ing her.
"China is very large, very old,
very obstinate. Her mines are val
uable; they are of great commercial
interest to other nations. Her four
hundred million people are as va
rious as the races of Europe. In
language she is no more united
than they, though more uniformity
of tongues exists in the southern
part. The people of Canton cannot
he understood at Pekin; Chinese
from various sections of the coun
try are foreigners to each other
and are treated as such. This is
true only of the spoken tongues;
the written language is the same
throughout and creates a bond of
union among the more highly edu
cated.
"As to Chinese characteristics,
they seem very contradictory to us.
A Chinese has a complete lack of
nerve; he is not sensitive as the
European is. He can sleep in the
most uncomfortable positions and
amid the most deafening noises
without being disturbed. A Chi
nese gentleman cannot, understand
the desire for privacy exhibited by
the European. He is not ashamed
of what lie does; all his actions are
open. Dishonesty and honor min
gle strangely in his make-up. He
never breaks his pledge no matter
what the temptation. His sense of
honor is very strong, yet dishones
ty and bribery mark official life.
He is wily yet wise, courageous yet
cowardly."
As to the late difficulties in Chi
na and its possible remedy, Dr.
Jordan said that the scholar class
had sided with the Boxers. Japan
had been lirst to act and had made
the best record, her sole purpose
being to rescue the people in Tien
Tsin and Peking. America had
done well, and British, Russians,
and Germans had fought bravely,
though he can find no possible ex
cuse for the looting of Tien Tsin
after its capture.
As to the cause of all the trouble
Dr. Jordan mentioned as tirst and
least important the presence of for
eign missionaries who had not all
maintained the most devout lives
in their missionary careers. They
had disturbed old ideas and,
though many of them had done
good work, others had enriched
themselves and made themselves
objects of hatred. There is nothing
to be said against our ministers. It

is our business agents who dis
graced us in China.
