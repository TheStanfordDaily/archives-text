We would suggest that the foot
ball management arrange for its
series of class games at once, pro
vided it has not already done so.
The class games should take place
early in the season and be out of
the way before the more serious
work of the season has begun. The
schedule for these games should be
run off within the next two weeks,
as after that time they will inter
fere with the regular Varsity and
Freshman games. A number of
men have signed for football and
have come out for practice with the
sole intent of playing on their class
teams, and there is no reason why
these men should not be given their
chance to play at once. Let the
managers of the class teams confer
with the manager and arrange for
the games shortly. The class games
have always excited much interest
and afforded considerable amuse
ment, as well as affording the
classes a chance to show their latent
enthusiasm by a liberal display of
class hats and canes, as well as
giving the Freshmen a chance to
use their new yell. Let us have
the class games at once.
