The Chess Club is an organiza
tion deserving the enthusiastic sup
port of the student body, and now
that it has been revived again this
year there should be an increaced
interest taken in the game of chess.
Until last year it had always been
the custom to hold an intercollegi
ate chess tournament with Berke
ley, and the Chess Club was organ
ized to unite the chess players of
the University and keep up inter
est in the game. However, Stan
ford has always been the loser in
these tournaments, and last year
the contest went by default, due to
the lack of interest here at Stan
ford and the inability to get a team
together. This year the Chess
Club proposes to arouse renewed

interest, and is attempting to at
tract those who play chess by ar
ranging a series of tournaments to
decide upon a team. It would seem
that one of the causes of our losing
in chess is due to the total apathy
of the student body in regard to the
contest. If we are going to contin
ue chess as an intercollegiate con
test, the Btudent body must take
some action in recognition of those
who play chess, or it will of neces
sity fail through lack of interest.
The Chess Club is doing what it
can to keep chess prominent, and
the student body should do its
share.
