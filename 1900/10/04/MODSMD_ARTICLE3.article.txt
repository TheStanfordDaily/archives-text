A glance over the summaries in
this issue show several significant
facts. The whole number of new
students is exactly fifty less than
last year, which is also true of the
number of Freshmen. The num
ber of graduates, advanced stu
dents, and specials remains about
the same as last year. In regard
to major students, the department
of English still leads, with Law
second. The department which
shows the greatest increase, how
ever, is the department of Geology,
which has increased frbm 13 in '98
to 39 in 1900. The falling off in
new students can be traced to the
more stringent entrance require
ments that have gone into effect
this year.
