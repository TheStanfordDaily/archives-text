# THE 						WEEK'S FOOTBALL.
## A 						Review of the Freshmen and Varsity Squads.â€”Freshmen vs. Mt. Tamalpais Tomorrow. 
### 
The week's work in football lias
been slightly interfered with on ac
count of the rain, but nevertheless
some good work has been done on
both Freshman and Varsity squads.
The practice Wednesday evening
was on the baseball held, the grid
iron being too muddy for play,
while last night there was no foot
ball at all, as even the diamond
was too wet for practice.
The Freshmen are pulling out of
their slump, and are beginning to
play a fast and snappy game.
Stanford at right half is showing
up very well. He is a hard player,
and uses his head well. Lunt at
tackle is doing excellent work, and
the fierceness and dash that he puts
into his game are worthy of an
older player. He gets into every
play and rarely misses a tackle.
Of the other backs, McGilvray i6
putting up a good game and is a
fast, hard player. The Freshmen
have a game scheduled for tomor
row afternoon, when they meet the
Mount Tamalpais team on the
campus. The latter team has the
reputation of being better than
either of the teams which have yet
met the Freshmen, and the game
promises to furnish some excellent
football. The band will be on the
bleachers at the game tomorrow for
the first time this season. Follow
ing is the line-up: Center, Burton;
left guard, McFadden; right guard,
Kennedy; left tackle, Lunt; right
tackle, Frederickson; left end,
Clark; right end, Patterson; quar
ter, Bansbach; left half, Taylor;
right half, Stanford; fullback, Mc-
Gilvray.
The Varsity, while it has not
been lining-up for long at a time,
is nevertheless improving. Signal
practice and team work are re
ceiving a great deal of attention,
and in this respect the next game
will see a marked improvement
over that displayed in the game
with Reliance.
"Chet" Murphy has had a squad
of the most promising kickers un
der bis charge for a week or more,
coaching them in punting and en
deavoring to develop a man who
can kick in Varsity form.
The next Varsity game is sched
uled for Thursday afternoon in
San Jose, where they meet the
team from the State Normal
School.
