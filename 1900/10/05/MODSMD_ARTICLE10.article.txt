An erroneous report seems to
have become prevalent that the
proposed amendment to the consti
tution of the Associated Students is
aimed directly at the women of the
University. This is untrue. The
amendment is aimed at those stu
dents who take pride in saying
that they have never paid their
student body assessment. If cer
tain of student women have been
lax in paying the required assess
ment, then the amendment is for
them as well. There is no doubt
that the proposed amendment is a
good thing, especially in the pres
ent state of student body finances,
and will go a long way toward in
creasing the available funds at a
time when ready money is most
needed. There may be a few stu
dents who do not consider that the
securing of their rights as mem
bers of the student body is worth
the payment of one dollar per year,
but those students are of necessity
few and lacking in college spirit.
