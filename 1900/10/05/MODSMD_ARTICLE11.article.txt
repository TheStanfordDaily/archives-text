Complaint is made by the officers
of the Constitutional Amendment
Club that the student body does
not show the proper spirit of will
ingness to assist the club in its
efforts to pass the amendment. No
tices have appeared in this paper
asking students from various parts
of the State to come forward and
give the club the benefit of their
knowledge of local conditions. A
few have responded in a way that
promises well for success, but the
majority of those called for have
made no response whatever. This
is not the right spirit. The passage
of this amendment is imperative,
if the University is to be secured in
the possession of its property.
Gratitude to the founders for their
magnificent gift, as well as true
college loyalty, demands that every
Stanford student or alumnus should
work from now until election with

might and main to secure that de
sired end. It will not do to lull
ourselves into a fancied feeling of
security. Reports from various
parts of the State indicate that the
amendment will fail unless good
hard work is done for its passage.
The club cannot do the work alone
and it cannot afford the time re
quired to drum up assistance. A
student who does not give the as
sistance asked for by the club,
when it is within his power to do
so, is unworthy of the benefits
which have been conferred upon
him by the generosity of Senator
and Mrs. Stanford.
