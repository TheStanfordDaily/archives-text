# The 						Third "Chaparral."
## 
### 
The third issue of the Chaparral
appeared Wednesday, its regularity
to date being in pleasing contrast
with the irregularity of last year.
Coining twice a month, it always
appears on the Wednesdays nearest
the first and fifteenth, the next is
sue being due on the seventeenth.
The current number marks an im
provement, particularly in the
matter of verse. The drawings are
up to the standard and a new
name is represented in the art
work, that of J. K. Bonnell. His
work is of the decorative order and
will add variety to the paper. Cul
ver, '99, whose political cartoons
now are achieving such great suc
cess, is a regular contributor and
this issue presents two of his in
imitable animal drawings. Draw
ings by Bowman and Bristow
Adams complete the art work, R.
E. Renaud, '03, not being repre
sented â€”though with the number
and variety of the drawings that
appear the loss is not distinctly
felt. The first editorial ably sus
tains the Chaparral's reputation
as containing the .best that Stan
ford has known for some time, and
the various sketches and jokes are
truly good fun.
