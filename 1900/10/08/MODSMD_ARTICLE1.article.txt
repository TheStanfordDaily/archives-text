# FRESHMEN VICTORIOUS
## Mount Tamalpais Defeated 16-0. Freshmen List Sent In. Class Schedule. 
### 
Saturday's game between the
Freshmen and the Mount Tamal
pais Military Academy, whileshow
ing a score in our favor, was not as
good a game aB was expected. The
Freshmen did all their scoring in
the first half, making three touch
downs and one goal, the first touch
down being made from the kick-off
within live minutes from the start.
The first half was a series of long
runs and bucks for the Freshmen
for their successive touchdowns,
while Tamalpais played a stubborn
game but seemed powerless to stop
the fierce rushes of the Stanford
backs.
The second half was a complete
surprise to the bleachers, who were
expecting a 80-0 score, and it evi
dently was such to the Freshmen
themselves, for they were utterly
unable to repeat their performance
of the first part of the game. The
short intermission seemed to give
the military academy team a
chance to get up their nerve and
this time their stubbornness was of
some avail for they not only pre
vented the' Freshmen from scoring
but gave a good account of them
selves when the ball was in their
possession. The Freshmen, on the
other hand, seemed to have the
idea that the game was theirs al
ready and failed to put their
former dash into their play.
The best work for the Freshmen,
both on offensive and defensive,
was done by McGilvray at fullback
and by Lunt at tackle, who put
up his usual strong and heady
game. Stanford also ditl well with
the ball. For the academy Ellin
wood gave a good account of him
self with his strong, fast bucks, and
Gutierrez, the little quarter, called
forth applause time and again for
his good work in backing up his
team. Following is the line-up:
