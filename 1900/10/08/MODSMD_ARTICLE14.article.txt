The proposed amendment to the
constitution of the Associated Stu
dents to change the Sequoia from
a weekly magazine to one appear
ing bi-weekly will very likely pass
without much opposition. Such a
move was attempted several years
ago, but was voted down. How
ever, the trend of sentiment here of
late has been in favor of making
the issues of our literary paper less
frequent in the hope of increasing
its efficiency. There can be no
doubt that the paper has sadly de
teriorated and is hardly a fit repre
sentative of Stanford's literary abil
ity. If, as those who favor the
movement declare, it will give us a
better magazine, let us at least give
it a trial and watch for the result.
It is true that Stanford and Berke
ley are the only two colleges of any
size that attempt a weekly literary
paper, all other institutions issuing
magazines monthly or bi-weekly.
This gives the editor time to issue
a number that is gotten up without
the attendant haste and conse
quent looseness so characteristic of
the college weekly.
