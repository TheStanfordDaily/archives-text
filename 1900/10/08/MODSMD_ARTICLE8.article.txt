## Reverend George Eldredge of San Francisco Preaches the Regular Sunday Sermon. 
### 
The regular Sunday sermon was
preached in the chapel yesterday
morning by the Rev. Geo. G. El
dredge of San Francisco. His text
was taken from the fifth chapter of
Matthew, the sixth verse, "Blessed
are they which do hunger and
thirst after righteousness, for they
shall be filled." He said:
"The law to be brought from
this is that every one who hungers
and thirsts shall be tilled. We live
as though this law were not true.
The greatest and best of things in
life we are apt to shun and slur
over for things of small signifi
cance. This hungering and thirst
ing is one of the great things. God
has so constructed things that
everything comes to the man who
really desires, nothing comes to
him who desires nothing.
"Christ understood this sense of
hungering and thirsting in a
desert for forty days and forty
nights without food. When He
speaks of hungering and thirsting
He would have us hunger after
righteousness as the man who for
long days has marched without
food, hungers for bread. The limit
of his desire is the degree with
which he shall be filled. The
reason why so many are empty is
because so many never really de
sire to be tilled.
"The reason our lives amount to
so little and accomplish so little is
because we are so pusillanimous.
God's promises are not to the man
who merely likes God and shuns
evil, but to him who loves God and
hates evil. To him who is on tire
with zeal the promise is made.
He said, "Ask and ye shall be
filled, seek and ye shall find, knock
and it shall be opened unto you."
Christ said in so many places
that to him who really desires it
shall be given.
"Every law is like a sharp
knife —taken by the handle it
proves a blessing; by the point, a
curse. 'Cursed is that man who
hungers and thirsts after idleness
and ease, for he shall be filled with
the results of these things.' This is
not an arbitrary thing but a nat
ural result of such hungering and
thirsting. We sometimes doubt
this law, but it works as completely
for good as for evil. It is not only
true that he who sows tares shall
reap tares, but he who sows wheat
shall reap wheat.
"Blessed is that student who
hungers and thirsts after knowl
edge, for he shall be filled; but most
blessed is the man who desires good
ness. The highest ambition is to
be good. Paul, in speaking of the
mutability of things, said, 'but
here remaineth these three, faith,
hope, and charity.'
"What is righteousness but God
likeness, and he who thirsts after
righteousness shall come into glory
by the spirit of God."
