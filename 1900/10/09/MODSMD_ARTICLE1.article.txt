## Last Night's Practice. Harvard Sends a Request for a Game with Our Varsity. 
### 
The Varsity practice last night
was given up entirely to punting
and signal practice. The Fresh
men lined up for a few minutes'
brisk play and managed to demon
strate the fact to the bleachers
that they have a great deal of prac
tice ahead of them before they de
velop into intercollegiate form.
They are being taught a great deal
of football, however, and if they
can be brought to the point where
they can use their knowledge they
should be able to round into fair
shape within the next three weeks.
Manager Oildersleeve received a
letter this morning from the man
ager and captain of the Harvard
University team, containing a chal
lenge for a game with the Stanford
team on November 17th at Cam
bridge, Massachusetts. It will, of
course, be impossible for the team
to go East at that time on account
of the proximity of the Thanksgiv
ing day game, but the manage
ment hopes to be able to arrange
another game with the crimson.
Harvard's courtesy will be acknowl
edged by the extending of an invi
tation to their team to visit the
Coast on liberal terms. If suitable
arrangements cannot be made on
this proposition, Harvard will be
asked to play in the East on a date
after Thanksgiving, probably dur
ing the Christmas vacation, as at
that time the men could leave the
University most conveniently and
the faculty would probably look
on the scheme with more favor.
The arrangement of a Harvard-
Stanford game will depend largely
on the outcome of the California-
Stanford game. Never before in
the history of Coast football has
one of the Big Four sent an invita
tion for a game to one of the West
ern colleges, and the management
is of course highly pleased with the
courtesy that Harvard has shown
us. It is highly probable that
either California or Stanford, or
perhaps both, will play one of the
Big Four teams this season. Man
ager Gildersleeve, while East dur
ing the summer, made arrange
ments with Princeton for a game,
provided we win from Berkeley,
and this communication from Har
vard makes a game with one of the
big teams almost certain.
