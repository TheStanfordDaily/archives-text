It appears that the athletic
agreement between the University
of California and Stanford is not. to
be taken seriously by our friends
across the bay. One section of this
agreement expressly states that a
list of eligible candidates shall be
submitted by each university at
least three weeks before the contest
t
takes place. Last Saturday the
time expired for the submission of
names for the Freshman game.
The Stanford management has for
warded its list of names according
to agreement, but so far nothing
has been heard from Berkeley.
According to the very terms of the
athletic agreement, it is now null
and void, broken by either the care
lessness or deliberate intention of
the University of California. Of
what avail is such an agreement if
it is to be broken on the very first
occasion? As the matter stands
now the - management can submit
as many more names as tliey wish,
and make up the Freshman eleven
as may seem fit. It has always
been complained that in previous
agreements between Stanford and
Berkeley, Stanford has in some way
received the worst of it. Last year
Stanford lost two men from its
Freshman team who through an
oversight were omitted from the
list, and were deprived of their
right to play on seemingly tech
nical grounds. As the matter
now stands Stanford is bound by
no agreement, and the arrange
ments for the Freshman game are
at a standstill. Our management
may either call the game off or sub
mit the names of all those persons
who were prohibited from playing
by the defunct agreement.
