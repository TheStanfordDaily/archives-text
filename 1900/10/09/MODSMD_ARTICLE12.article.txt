To the Editor:
It* has been rumored of late that
the amendment to the constitution
restricting the franchise to thosse
paying their annual dues is intend-

Ed to prevent the women students
from voting, that ought not to
have the right to vote as they do
not contribute toward the support
of athletics. Such is not the case,
however, for in going over the stubs
of my receipts today I found that
out of a total of S ( JI assessments
collected, 171 of these were collect
ed from women students. It seems
to me that this ought to prove con
clusively that the women of the
University do contribute toward
the support of the student body,
and that they will not altogether
be prohibited from voting should
the amendment pass.
I am, sir, Yours very respectfully,
Henry H. Taylor.
