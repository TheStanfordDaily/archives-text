# Two New Paintings for the Museum.
## 
### 
Mrs. Stanford has recently
bought two well-known paintings
representing two phases of pioneer
life, "Crossing the Plains" and
"Saturday Night in the Mines."
Though the price is not known, it
is supposed to have been $5000.
The pictures, which were owned by
J. O. Coleman, have been for a
number of years on the walls op
posite the staircases of the capitol,
where they have been admired by
connoisseurs in art from all parts
of the United States.
Both paintings, which are the
work of Richard Nahl, the celebrat
ed painter, arrived at the museum
last Friday. They will be opened,
mounted, and hung in the art gal
lery sometime this week.
