Balance on hand 801 51
$1,242 48
Despite this balance there is
$1,275 from last season which must
yet be paid. This debt is divided
as follows: $500 due the Bank of
Palo Alto on December Ist, with
six per cent, interest; $375 due the
Senior Class on December Ist, and
miscellaneous bills from last season
amounting to •f4OO. Besides this,
bills have been incurred to date
this semester amounting to $1,500,
and salaries for the semester
amounting to $2,500. All these
bills must necessarily be paid be
fore the end 'of this semester and
after the Thanksgiving game. Our
current or running expenses have

thus far been met by the collection
of about (300 student body assess
ments (nearly '200 more than were
collected up to this time last year)
and tbe sale of about 200 season
tickets, as well as such receipts us
we have received from games
played, cash balance from last sea
son being only about $65.
The Glee Club is indebted to the
student body to the extent ot
about $454, but the major part of
this will be cleared before Thanks
giving, as arrangements have been
completed with W. M. Parkin for a
big vaudeville and concert in the
Assembly Hall the evening of the
first Saturday in November.
