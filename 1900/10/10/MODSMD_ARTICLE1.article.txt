## Varsity Does Good Work at Practice.—Varsity vs. San Jose Normal Tomorrow. 
### 
A large crowd was out last night
at football practice, and it was re
warded by seeing one of the best
practices of the season. The two
Freshman elevens lined up for a
short time and turned their oppor
tunity to good account by playing
some fast smashing football.
The Varsity was then lined up
against the second eleven, and both
teams played good hard ball. The
addition of Coach Yost behind the
second's line towards the close of
the practice materially strength
ened that team's play and enabled
them to score one touchdown
against the Varsity in return for
the two made by the latter earlier
in the game. The work of Yost
gave the first team an opportunity
to get a little defensive practice,
which is particularly valuable and
exactly what the team needs.
For the Varsity, Seeley, Slaker,
and Fisher did some very good
work with the ball, while Nourse,
Wardall, and Roberts did some ex
cellent defensive work 011 the sec
ond. Tom McFadden is playing
in his old position on the Varsity
and is rapidly rounding into his
old-time form. Geissler showed up
well at halfback on the Varsity.
The teams lined up as follows:
