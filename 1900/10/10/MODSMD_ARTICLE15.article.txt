The Optimist, that clever and
exceedingly attractive little maga
zine of criticism, review, and in
spiration, published at Boone,
lowa, is affording a medium for
young authors who have bright
ideas and know how to felicitously
express them. It has many well
known names among its contribu
tors, but the fact that it omits all
titles to distinction and guages all
matter admitted to its pages solely
on the score of merit, is a source of
encouragement and inspiration to
many writers familiar with the
methods of the older, wealthier,
and much more widely known
magazines from which they are de
barred by an idolatrous reverence
for "reputation." This is one of
the reasons The Optimist has be
come instantly popular —because
names are subordinated to quality
and literary essence.
