Galveston hurricane, and from

scribing the disaster are taken:
"Our house being the strongest in
the vicinity, my father invited
some of the neighbors in when it
became evident that the storm was
to be severe. There were ten in the
house, live besides our family. As
the water rose, they were driven to
the second story and from there to
the balcony, where they stood on
the railing, clinging to the pillars.
An unusually high wave wrenched
Josephine from my father's arms,
but he succeeded in getting her
again, and after this they all man
aged to climb to the roof. A cot
tage from across the street sailed

into our house and demolished it.
The roof was carried off by the wa
ter, with all the family except Lil
lian and Henry, who it was found
were gone forever. Their bodies
were found next day, but before
they could he buried the military
authorities ordered them taken out
to sea with others. The folks were
carried on the roof for six blocks
and then rescued, having to climb
over a great pile of debris to get
out. There is nothing left of or
about our two houses except an
iron hitching-post. My father's
loss in property was about $12,000.
We have rooms at present, but
shall probably rebuild on another
lot. lam working for the electric
company, and hope to return to
Stanford next September."
