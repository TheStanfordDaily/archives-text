# NEW ATHLETIC RULES.
## Many Restrictions Placed on Athletics by a Conference of College Professors. 
### 
The sub-committee, appointed at
a conference of the faculty commit
tee on athletics of the principal
American universities about two
years ago to investigate the matter
of intercollegiate competition in
all its phases, recently made its re
port. The new rules are most ex
haustive, and calculated to develop
sports at colleges on strictly ama
teur lines. The committee which
has framed the regulations is as
follows:
Professor Ira N. Hollis, Harvard;
Professor George S. Patterson, Uni
versity of Pennsylvania; Professor
Henry B. Fine, Princeton; Profes
sor Wilfred H. Munro, Brown;
President Benjamin 1. Wheeler,
University of California; Professor
James F. Kemp, Columbia; and
Professor Louis M. Dennis, Cornell.
Considering the standing of the
members of the committee and the
time they have taken to draw up
the report, there is little doubt the
conditions will be accepted. The
new regulations will in a large
measure relieve the Intercollegiate
American Amateur Athletic As
sociation of the trouble of dealing
with violations of rules, as the plan
is to have a responsible committee
appointed for regulating the con
trol of athletics, on which the fac
ulty is represented.
It is proposed to place many re
strictions on students which are not
covered by the present intercol
legiate rules. Under the new con
ditions the man will not only have
to pass entrance examinations,
but will have to satisfy the ath
letic committee that he intends to
remain at the University through
out the year and' take a full year's
work. The class of students who
indulge in ''summer nine" or other
semi-professional ventures, are al
so dealt with in a manner that will
mean the extinction of the college
man as a part of these luxuries.
Permission of the athletic com
mittee will also have to beobtained
before a student can represent a
college in more than one branch of
sport. Another fur-reaching rule
is that no university team shall
take part in any public contest on
any other than college grounds,
while a direct blow is aimed at col
lege athletes who have been in the
habit of competing at games held
under the auspices of athletic clubs
by a provision that no match
games, races, or exhibitions ar
ranged by any athletic organiza
tion shall take effect until it has
been approved by the athletic com
mittee. liules as to the training
table and expenses are made par
ticularly stringent, and a man will
Ibe debarred from university teams
;if he owes money for his share of
'the training-table expenses of a
previous term.
[ The committee believes that the
large sums of money taken in at
i many of the football games form a
constant temptation to extrava
| gance and to the illicit use of
; money, and recommends that gate
j money be reduced to a minimum
by agreement of all universities.
