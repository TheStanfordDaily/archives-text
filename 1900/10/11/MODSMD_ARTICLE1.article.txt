# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Interesting Competition for Varsity Positions. -Saturday's Game. 
### 
Football practice is becoming
more and more interesting as the
season advances, and the number of
people on the bleachers every even
ing is a fair indication of the spirit
of the student body. The yelling
is improving and when the songs
are published some enthusiastic
rooting may be expected.
The Varsity's line-up last night
showed the gradual improvement
that has been noticed of late in
speed and handling the ball. The
fumblew which were so noticeable in
the Reliance game still continue,
although they do not occur as fre
quently as formerly.
There is a competition for places
going on which is a delight to the
coach and captain, and which
speaks well for the future. This is
particularly noticeable among the
halfbacks, where a four-cornered
fight between Fisher, Geissler, Hill,
and Smith is making things ex
ceedingly interesting. There are
also several fast and heady men
out after the end positions. Of
these McFadden is counted to do
the best work, but amongst others
there is the closest kind of a fight.
Following is last night's line-up:
VARSITY. SECOND.

The Reliance-Stanford game in
San Francisco next Saturday
should draw a good crowd. Reli
ance will undoubtedly be in better
form than formerly as they have
had the experience of a game with
California since meeting Stanford,
and our own team will have the
advantage of two weeks' coaching.
