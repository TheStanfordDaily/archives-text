One of the principal features of
the football practice yesterday was
the distribution on the bleachers of
a song, "Sons of Stanford," by H.
D. Walter. This song was written
for the prize competition, and was
labeled, "Rejected Me." Walter
submitted several football songs in
a contest where it was understood
that all manuscripts should be
available for the song-book, whether
prize-winners or not. When he
found that his songs were not suc
cessful he refused to have any of
them published, but the committee
which had charge of the award pro
poses to stand on its rights and use
at least one of the Walter songs.
Mr. Walter is dissatisfied with the
judgment of the committee, and
having the courage of his convic
tions that his song is of superior
merit, takes this method of putting
his belief to.the test, using the gen
eral public as his jury. A consen
sus of opinion on the campus last
night seemed to point that Walter's
action is unsportsmanlike, as he
placed his verses before a commit
tee whose personnel he knew and
011 whose judgment he was tacitly
understood to place reliance. The
action he has taken has been con
demned as discourteous to the
judges and to the successful con
testant.
