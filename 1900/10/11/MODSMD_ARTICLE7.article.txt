# The
						Stanford University Constitutional Amendment.
## 
### 
The general idea as to the pur
poses of the amendment is that it
is to relieve the University from
taxation, when as a matter of fact
it does not exempt the University
from any taxation whatever, but
leaves all such matters to the leg
islature. Its real purpose is to
correct certain vital defects in the
founding grant; to secure the Uni
versity in the possession of what it
now has; to confer upon the Trus
tees the corporate powers necessary
to manage the trust; and to enable
them to receive, in the future, the
money which any one may desire
to give to the University. These
matters are vital to the existence
and future of the University. The
taxation feature is only permissive,
is carefully guarded, and may be
withdrawn at any time.
I. Defects in the Original Grant.—
When the University was founded
it was necessary to have some au
thority from the legislature to do
so. As the Constitution of the
State prohibits any special legisla
tion, it was necessary that a general
act be passed, under which avy in
stitution might he founded and en
dowed. This general act was, un
fortunately, loosely drawn. Items
which did not seem objectionable
in 1885 would now work to defeat
the very objects of the foundation
of the University. The chief de
fects in the original act and grant
are:
(1) Provision was made only for
the founding of such institutions.
(2) The act authorized only
written foundation grants, made
within the lifetime of the founder.
(3) Gifts and bequests were not
authorized, so that the University
can receive nothing by will.
(4) The University can receive
only property which is situated
within the State of California.
(5) Mrs. Stanford is unable to
make a confirmatory conveyance of
the property to the Board of Trus
tees.
(6) The Trustees do not have
the corporate powers necessary to
carry out the provisions of the
trust.
(7)While prohibiting the Trus
tees from ever converting the en
dowment into real estate and pro
viding that it must always be kept
in the form of good securities
(legally known as "personal prop
erty"), the act does not provide for
the exemption of these securities
from taxation. The result is that
the endowment must be kept in
United States or other non-taxable
bonds, because the net income from

these is larger than that from tux
able bonds. The University money
is thus driven out of the State, the
State gains absolutely nothing in
taxes, and the University loses
thousands of dollars in income
each year and can do a correspond
ingly smaller work for the State.
(8) The original grant makes
the University, to all intents and
purposes, a State institution by
providing that the Trustees must
annually make a report to the
Governor giving a full record of
their proceedings, and an itemized
statement of all sources of income
and of all expenditures. Many
universities are not required
to do this. The University offers
free tuition to all of the people of
the State, can never receive a cent
of money from the State, and is
compelled to pay the State a tax
upon the buildings, libraries, and
apparatus used in providing its
sons and daughters with a free edu
cation. This the University feels
to be unjust. Only two other
States in the Union tax private in
stitutions, and tliey are small
llocky Mountain States having no
private institutions of any rank,
and hence the question has never
a risen.
(9) In addition to the defects
pointed out above, there is much
doubt as to the constitutionality of
the original act itself.
(10) None of these defects can
be corrected by statute and made
applicable to Stanford University,
as any special legislation would be
unconstitutional.
//. What the Amendment Would
Do. —To remedy these defects and
to insure the future of the institu
tion a constitutional amendment
has been passed by the legislature
and proposed to the people for rati
fication. It embodies four pro
visions. I will state these in the
order of their importance to the
University.
(1) The first provision confirms
the trusts already provided for in
the founding grant and permits
Mrs. Stanford as residuary legatee
to make a confirmatory convey
ance of all the property to the Board
of Trustees. It, removes all doubt
as to the constitutionality of the
grant and all fears as to long and
uncertain legal contests by incor
porating into the constitution of
the State the statement that all of
the grants and gifts are "permitted,
approved, and confirmed."
(2) The second provision per
mits the University to receive prop
erty in addition to that covered by
the original grants, and by any
form of conveyance, either during
the lifetime or after the death of the
donor. Lt removes the restriction
as to its location in California, and
permits the Trustees to receive prop
erty situated anywhere in the
world. The desirability of this
provision may be inferred from the
fact that two men have already ex
pressed their desire to leave their
wealth by will to the University,
and the property of both is not
within the borders of the State.
This provision also permits the leg
islature to give to the Trustees suf
ficient corporate power to manage
the trust.
