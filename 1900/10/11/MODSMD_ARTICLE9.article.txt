We publish today an article by
Professor Cubberley on the Stanford
Constitutional Amendment. It
discusses the question in a manner
different from the other documents
on the subject, and will therefore
be read with interest by all con
cerned in the University's welfare.
Every copy of the Daily I j alo
Alto containing this article should
be mailed to someone at home with
a request that he give it to someone
else when he has read it.
