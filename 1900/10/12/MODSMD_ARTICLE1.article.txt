# STANFORD WINS.
## Varsity Defeats State Normal School Team 35-0.â€”Tomorrow's Game. 
### 
The eleven from the State Nor
mal School at San Jose was defeat
ed yesterday at the Cyclers' Park
in that city by the Varsity by a
score of 35-0. While the score was
one-sided, yet the Normals put up
a fair game and their fight was cer
tainly a gritty one. The Stanford
men all played good individual
games and at times the team work
was very good. The chief fault to
be noticed was slowness in lining
up, while the play itself was some
what ragged on account of the
careless manner in which the team
went at its work. After a few
touchdowns the men took things
too easily, feeling that the game
was already won and that it would
be useless to pile up a score. The
result was that they did not make
the most of an excellent opportu
nity to practice team work.
Of the players, Geissler was con
spicuous for his dashing work with
the ball, while his defense was of a
high order. He has a neat straight
arm which he used to a good ad
vantage yesterday. Smith showed
up well also on the offensive, and
Slaker and Seeley were up to their
standard
Normal opened the game by
kicking off to Smith, who ran in
several yards. Smith and Geissler
alternated in taking the pigskin
between ends and tackles for good
gains. Slaker's punt was carried
in six yards by Meese. but the
Normals could not make their dis
tance and Stanford again took the
ball. Slaker went through for
three yards and Raitt skirted the
end on a double pass for a touch
down. Goal was kicked, making
the score 6-0.
Normal again kicked to Smith,
who was downed without gain.
Stanford punted but Normal could
not keep the ball and the Cardinal
began a steady advance down the
Held for a touchdown, which was
made by Geissler. Raitt kicked
the goal. Score 12-0.
On the third kick-off, the ball
was returned some distance. Stan
ford punted and Traeger secured
the ball and made a touchdown.
Raitt kicked the goal. The ball
was run in some distance on the
next kick-off, and the Varsity be
gan another of its marches across
the field, and with a series of guard
and tackle-back formations made
its fourth touchdown. Raitt failed
to kick the goal. The half ended
with a score of 23-0 in favor of the
Cardinal.
The second half was not so one
sided as was the first, although a
number of new men went into the
Varsity. The San Jose team took
a brace towards the close of the
half and only two touchdowns were
made.
Stanford kicked off to Heston,
who ran the ball in ten yards. The
Varsity took the ball on downs
and in a few fast plays worked
down the field, when Hill carried
the ball over for a touchdown.
Luck kicked the goal. Score 29-0.
Here the Normals braced and did
some good work on their own ac

count. Heston, Meese, and Birch
made some good gains, but they
were unable to keep the ball. Hill
got the pigskin on a fumble and
made the last touchdown of the
game. Time was called with the
ball in Stanford's possession on
the Normals ten-yard line. The
line-up was as follows:

grounds in the city. This will be
the only Varsity game in San

a good crowd should be on hand
from Stanford. The athletic club

ter condition than they have been
before, and if the Varsity is in as
good condition as is expected the
game will be an interesting one.
