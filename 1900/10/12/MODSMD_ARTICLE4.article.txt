# ALUMNI IN THE ORIENT.
## Men and Women Graduates of Stanford See Fighting in China this Last Summer. 
### 
In connection with his lecture
on China, Dr. Jordan last week
gave the following information con
cerning Stanford students in the
Orient:
Homer Lea,ex-'OO, whose projects
received attention in the San Fran
cisco papers during the summer, is
in a secret society, which is at
tempting to restore the Emperor.
He is in command of certain forces
hut what the nature of his work
will be is not definitely known, as
it is hard to learn much of anything
concerning Chinese secret societies
and their doings.
Van Norman McGee, C. E., '98,
is professor of geology in the Im
perial University at Tien Tsin.
Ed. R. Lyman, Chemistry, '96, is
superintendent of the polytechnic
school in Shanghai.
Noah F. Drake, Geology, '94, is
professor of mining engineering
in the Imperial University at Tien
Tsin. During the fight there the
building was entirely destroyed,
but "Drake and his fossils" escaped
un harmed.
li. C. Hoover, Geology, '95, was
at the battle of Tien Tsin. Mrs.
Hoover, formerly Miss Lou Henry,
Geology, '98, remained with him
during the fight. Both stayed in
Tien Tsin until the city was re
lieved, when they went to Taku.
Neither was out of China during
the season of real lighting. Hoover
is the director of the mining engi
neers employed by the Chinese
Mining and Engineering Company
of London, which is working some
valuable mines for the Chinese
government, about Tien Tsin and
farther into the interior. Each of
the Stanford engineers engaged had
his company of Chinese troops.
George B. Wilson, Geology, '96,
brought his one hundred
Chinese to Nagasaki, after
having seen fighting in Tien Tsin.
J. H. Means, A. M., Geology,' 92,
was the first to come away from
Mongolia, where he was in the gov
ernment employ, exploring mines.
The Boxer movement became real
to him when a shot was fired into
his office. He packed up and
started for Nagasaki, where he is
now. His train was the last to
leave Mongolia, as he was followed
by mobs who tore up the railroad
behind him.
James Francis Abbott, '99, who
has been in Otsu in an English
school, was teaching at a biological
station at Misiki during the sum
mer. He will be a student in the
Imperial University this year.
1). Brainerd Spooner, '99, is at
Tokio, where he has been tutoring
the son of the minister at Siatn.
