Tomorrow's game with the Re
liance in the city should draw a
large crowd, as in all probability it
will be a better game than that of
two weeks ago. Both teams have
been doing some hard work, and
are in better form. Reliance's
game last Saturday was a great sur
prise to Berkeley, and judging
from the progress Reliance had
made since her game the week pre
vious, they can be expected to put
up a much better game. The re
sult of tomorrow's game should
furnish some slight means of judg
ing the relative condition of the
two University teams at this stage
of the season.
