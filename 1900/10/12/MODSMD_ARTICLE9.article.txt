The University faculty has al
ways been chary of granting holi
days to the students, and there can
be no doubt that Stanford has less
holidays than other institutions.
However, it would seem that the
faculty should make an exception
this year and grant a holiday on
election day. Election day, while
a legal holiday in this State, has
never been regarded as such here,
and some of the professors have
even been known to hold examina
tions on that day. This year with
the necessity for passing the Stan
ford Amendment, there is much
that students can do in favor of the
measure. Jf the University wishes
to have a large number of students
out doing active work, it should
make some concession that would
make it more of an object for stu
dents to work. It would seem
advisable for the faculty to
grant the students not only
one holiday, but to make hoidays
of both Monday and Tues
day, November sth and 6th. This
will give the students a chance to
do more work and go into more
distant parts of the State, by leav
ing the University on Friday and

spending that time until Tuesday
in active canvassing for the amend
ment. The two days before the
election will prove to be a time
when much valuable work can be
done. It would seem that the Uni
versity would be serving its best in
terests by making November sth
and 6th holidays.
