Stanford Defeats Reliance in a
Closely Contested Game.
Score, 6-0.

The second of the series of Stan
ford-lieliance games played last
Saturday resulted in a victory for
the Varsity with a score of 6-0.
The club men were clearly out
played from start to finish, and at
no time was our goal in serious
danger. The score should have
been larger, but the Varsity played
in hard luck. After working the
ball down to within ten yards of
scoring, they would lose it on a
fumble or off-side play and Ro
dolph would kick out of danger.
Reliance kicked off to Fisher.
Stanford in twenty plays carried
the bit.ll to the ten-yard line with
out losing possession of it. Here
Reliance made a stand and forced
Geissler back for a loss Rodolph
punted to the center of the field,
and Stanford again worked back to
the ten-yard line. On a fumble by
Geissler, Reliance took the ball,
and with two penalties for off-side
plays and two runs by Rodolph
around Allen's end, carried it to
Stanford's twenty-yard line.
Stanford took the ball and with
runs by Fisher, Slaker, and Raitt
carried it to the clubmen's twenty
five-yard line, when time was
called.
In the second half Hill took
Teissier's place at left half. Trae
ger kicked off to the fifteen-yard
line and secured the ball on Dins
more's fumble. Raitt made sixteen
yards around Thierkauf and Slaker
made the remaining yard for a
touchdown. Raitt kicked an easy
goal.
Reliance kicked off and in (ifteen
plays Stanford carried the ball
seventy yards and lost it on off
side play. Stanford again carried
the ball to the clubmen's five-yard
line and again to their ten-yard
line, each time losing it on penal
ties. The half ended with the ball
in Stanford's possession in the
middle of the field.
The best work for Stanford was
done by Fisher, Slaker, and Raitt,
while for Reliance, Rodolph and
Hamilton were the stars. Fisher's
running with the ball was a sur
prise—only once did he fail to gain
his distance. Slaker upheld his
reputation as a line plunger and
frequently made five yards at a
time. Raitt managed his team
well at times, but used poor judg
ment in handling Rodolph's punts.
