The meeting of the Associated
Students tomorrow afternoon is an
important one, for it means much
to the student body. Two propo
sitions which materially change
the constition of the Associated
Students are up for consideration,
and the result of the meeting will
show the attitude of the student
body toward them. The purpose
of the amendment of Article V,
which refers to elections, has been
explained in these columns. It is
believed that its effect will be to
purity student body politics and
incidentally place a premium upon
college spirit. Those who value
the privilege of voting will be
quite ready to pay the annual as
sessment of one dollar. The other
amendment is intended to make
the Sequoia a bi-weekly instead of
a weekly journal. This is but the
culmination of a feeling which has
been growing for some time, that
its high literary standard can be
maintained only by lengthening
the interval of time between each
issue.
There can be no doubt but
that the general trend of opinion is
in favor of these measures, and it
is almost certain that they will
pass at the meeting tomorrow.
They are a step in the right direc
tion and will prove of benefit to
the student body.
