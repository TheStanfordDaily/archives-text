## Regular Sunday Sermon Preached by Rev. George W. Stone of San Francisco. 
### 
The Sunday sermon was preached
in the chapel by the Kev. George
\V. Stone of San Francisco, field
secretary of the American Unitarian
Association. His subject, "Altru
ism,'' was based on Matthew 10:24:
" The disciple is not above his mas
ter, nor the servant above his lord."
He said :
"Our ecclesiasticism must bow
before all great truths; it must bow
to modern knowledge, or the mind
will be developing more rapidly
than the conscience. Altruism has
long been in the world, but men
have been ignorant of it. The re
sults of evolution steal upon the
world noiselessly, and are in our
midst long before we know it. The
wolf eats the lamb, not because he
knows the flesh is good for the up
building of his body, but because
he is hungry.
"Jf there is one principle of hu
manity taught by Christianity it is
the principle of human brother
hood. Some you will hear say,
' Men are not created free and
equal.' This is meant to draw a
caste distinction. The truest and
only test of superiority is charac
ter. No man who is superior will
fail to help his brother of infe
rior character. Responsibility rests
where real superiority is found. So
we come by a process of reasoning
to the principles of Altruism. The
individual is the means,government
the method, and society the end.
All government, especially a gov
ernment like ours, is prohibitory.
Our laws grant privileges, but fix
the bounds by which they are lim
ited. We say by this system, to
the unlearned, be wise ; to the poor,
be rich ; to the bad, be good.
" For one, 1 believe that the peo
ple of this government are coming,
slowly, to this attitude of society to
the individual. Until this is done,
the social progress will not be up
ward. Moth and dust will corrupt
and thieves break in and steal.
We need not wait for laws. We
have enough to begin with already.
Human intuitions in the end are
more powerful than human reason;
God in the soul, or love—or call it
what you will—never waits for the
slow, sluggish process of reason.
There is no record of a race so ig
norant that it did not recognize a
power outside of itself to which it
must defer.
"The time will come when a man
who talked of the purification of
politics will not be called a dema
gogue, he who preaches reform will
not be accused of having an axe to
grind. It cannot be done in a
year or may be in a generation, but
when every man who believes in
honesty and in truth is upright in
his beliefs, then it will he done.
In the struggle between righteous
ness and selfishness, the remedy
is to be found in altruism. The
universe waits to be called upon
for assistance. Mankind is work
ing out its destiny. "As we sow,
so shall we reap" is true of society,
as well as of the church. Let us
not say, "Let some one other than
myself fight this battle."

" 'Noblesse oblige' may well be
your motto. The world lias never
known such liberty sib you now
enjoy. Only the timid fear new
truths. Do your own thinking.
Don't depend on the past. Utilize
your science, your art, all the pow
ers your culture gives you to learn
the lessons the Universe gives to
us. The glory of tlie University
is that it encourages free thinking.
Truth knows no master. The Uni
versity is and ought to be dedicat
ed to the search for truth. We
must be freed from the burden of
ecclesiasticism. Jesus is our wit
ness for the spirit of altruism. 'He
who finds his life shall lose it, but
be who loses his life for my sake,'
for the sake of the truths He came
to teach, 'shall find it.' "
