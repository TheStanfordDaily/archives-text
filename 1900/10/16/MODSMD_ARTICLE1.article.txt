# NEITHER SIDE SCORES.
## Freshmen and Sophomores Play a 0-0 Game. 
### 
A large crowd witnessed the
Sophomore-Freshman game on the
campus yesterday afternoon, and
from a football standpoint it was
not disappointed. The game was
the fiercest and most closely con
tested of any seen on the campus
this season. The fact that the
Sophwmores had not been playing
as a team this season, that some of
their best men are debarred, being
Varsity men, and that the Fresh
men have had a number of games,
was taken as indicative of a Fresh
man victory.
From the kick-off, both teams
played hard ball and many men
were hurt but none seriously. The
ball was kept moving between the
goal lines and once or twice a score
was almost made, but the teams
were able to hold at critical mo
ments and the 0-0 score was the
result.
At the end of the first half
the Sophomores had the pigskin on
the Freshmen's two-yard line, and
Roberts was smashing through for
short gains at every play when the
call of time saved the Freshmen
from being scored against. Again
in the second half, the superior
training of the '04 men told on
their opponents and the ball was
steadily advancing through Sopho
more territory when the call of
time stopped the game.
Much class spirit was manifest
during the game, the rival factions
being organized into rooting sec
tions, and the yelling was the most
enthusiastic that has been heard
here this year.
The tie between the Freshman
and Sophmores will not be played
off until after the intercollegiate
Freshman game on October 27th.
The Sophomores, however, will play
the winner of this afternoon's game
on next Thursday. The Freshmen
will in turn play the winner of
Thursday's game after they have
met Berkeley's team. This action
has been taken on account of the
fierceness of the class games, and
the management has deemed it ad
visable to run no risks of having a
crippled Freshman team.
Following is the line-up:
