It is a sad commentary on the
ability of a class when they are
forced to go outside their numbers
for material for a peculiarly class
ceremonial, hut this seems to have
been the case with 1902. When
the Junior Class planned their
Plug Ugly, it was commonly sup
posed that there would he someone
in the class who would be able to
provide the necessary plot for the
exercises. But it seems that it was
not to be. No member of 1902
came forward with an idea for a
ceremony that was worth consider
ing, and the committee have been
forced to take.an under-classman's
production for presentation. If
the ceremonial was to be an elabor
ate affair like a class farce then
the committee would have been
justified in inviting the whole
student body to compete in order
that the production might be repre
sentative of Stanford's ability; but
in a ceremony like the Plug Ugly
has been heretofore, there is no
reason why plans of the ceremony
should be in open competition, be
cause such an exhibition as is
given is more in the nature of an
impromptu affair and should fall
within the range of the most ordi
nary ability. If the class intend
to make the Plug Ugly on a par
with the annual class farces then
they are justified in their action.
However, if they do they take
away much of the pleasure of the
ceremony to the outsider, for prev
ious ceremonials have been enjoy
able because of their seemingly un
conventional and impromptu na
ture. A more determined effort
should have been made by the
class to secure a plan from one of
its members, as it looks like a wo
ful lack of ability or class pride in
the Juniors.
