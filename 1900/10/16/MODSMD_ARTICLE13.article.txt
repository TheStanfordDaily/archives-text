# The
						Next " Chaparral."
## 
### 
The fourth issue of the Chaparral
will appear tomorrow, mid from the
management it is understood that
it will he the best yet. The edi
torials will probably not he up to
the best that have been published,
but there are more short jokes and
of a much higher order than in any
previous issue. The art work is
above the standard, and marks the
initial appearance of W. C. Fran
cis, '08, whose work was so success
ful in last year's Quad, in the
pages of the Chaparral. He is rep
resented by two excellent drawings,
one a full-page. In the exchanges
that have come so far, the Harvard
Lampoon, the Cornell Widow, the
Michigan Wrinkle, and the Wiscon
sin Sphinx, there have been fre
quent credited jokes from Stanford's
funny paper; and so far none of
them have come up to our own
paper either in material or general
appearance.
