# Overall Protested.

The management has submitted
to Dr. Richardson, chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Athletics,
evidence proving that Orval Over
all, California's big football, base
ball, and track man, of whom so
much has been heard from across
the bay, is a professional athlete.
The athletic authorities have been
at work for about two weeks gath
ering the evidence which is likely
to deprive Berkeley of one of her
most promising men, and the re
sult is that a. communication will
be sent to the faculty athletic com
mittee of the University of Califor
nia, calling the matter to their at
tention.
The affidavits submitted are
made by professional baseball
players who have played in the
same games with Overall, where
gate-money was taken. Additional
affidavits are in evidence from per
sons who witnessed the contests
and were familiar with their na
ture. There can be no doubt but
that the accusations will hold, as a
clearer case could not be made out
against a man than is the one
which the management has in re
gard to Overall.
The Berkeley management de
clares that the standing of their
big athlete cannot be questioned,
and express surprise that Stanford
has been looking up his record.
His loss will probably be a severe
one to California, as he is one of
their biggest men, weighing 210
pounds and being a recognized
athlete in all three branches. Me
has been trying for guard on the
football team.
