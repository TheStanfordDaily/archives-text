# DR. ROSS HONORED.
## Elected a Member of the International Sociological Institute of Paris. 
### 
Dr. E. A. Ross, head of the Eco
nomics and Sociology department
of the University, has been the re
cipient of a dist'nguished honor.
He has just received notice from
Paris that the ''Institute Inter
nationale de Sociologie" had
elected him an associate member
at their annual congress. As there
are not more than five or six in
the United States who belong to
the institute, and not more than
two teachers of Sociology, this can
be looked upon in the light of a
marked distinction. Professor
Boss was much surprised, as he
considers his contributions to Soci
ology as yet in the form of articles
and he had not supposed they had
attracted the notice of an institute
that elects only those who have
made copious and able contribu
tions to the science of Sociology.
The honor was entirely unex
pected, and coming from the source
that it does is to be highly ap
preciated. The institute has been
established eight years and the
membership is elective and limit
ed. The institute publishes a
magazine and publishes its annual
proceedings, both of which are of
great value and interest to sociolo
gical students the world over.
