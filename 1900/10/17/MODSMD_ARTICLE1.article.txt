# JUNIORS VICTORIOUS.
## 1902 Takes the Second of the Inter Class Championship Series. Saturday's Game. 
### 
The second of the series of class
games was won yesterday afternoon
by the Juniors by a score of 5-0.
The score is hardly an indication
of the comparative strength of the
two teams, as the playing was
nearly all done in Senior territory,
and at one time the ball was within
two inches of a touchdown for the
Juniors, when the Seniors held and
punted the ball out of danger. The
game was fast and furious for two
untrained teams, the intense class
rivalry that existed making the
play more tierce than it otherwise
would have been, and both teams
indulged freely in slugging.
As far as fuotball went the Jun
iors had much the better of the ar
gument, and kept the ball in their
possession most of the time. The
Junior backs put up the best indi
vidual games, Cawden and Frisselle
making some long end runs. Boren
was good for his distance through
the line nearly every time the ball
was given him. Wardall for the
Seniors played a hard game, but
his teammates failed to back him
up.
The second half drew to a close
without a score, although the ball
was rapidly approaching the '01
goal. Both teams agreed, however,
to play till a score was made to
avoid a tie, and as a result the
time was extended about fifteen
minutes. Slowly the Juniors
worked the pigskin down the field
to within one yard of the goal,
when Friselle was shot across the
line for a touchdown. Boren failed
to kick the goal. Score, 5-0. The
teams lined up as follows:
SENIORS. JUNIORS.
Symonds 1 e r,.J. McFadden

According to the arrangements
which the management has made,
the next class game will be played
tomorrow afternoon between the
Juniors and Sophomores. As both
teams will have the experience of
a game each to its credit, the con
test will probably be better football
than was seen in either of the
other games. The teams will line
up as follows:
JUNIORS. SOPHOMORES.
Campbell 1 e r Knight
Cone 1 t r Lowentha 1
Younger 1 g r Jacobs
Gage c Brooke
Rice r g I. . . . Thompson

The Varsity meets the team from
the San Jose Normal School again
next Saturday on the campus.

The Normals have been working
hard since their recent defeat and
claim that Saturday's score will
not be so one-sided as it was in
the last game. At any rate the
game should be a good one and
will present a good opportunity to
get a line on the Varsity's im
provement in the last two weeks.
