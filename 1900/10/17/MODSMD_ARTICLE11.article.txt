A certain Junior living at
Menlo Park, who belongs to one
of the campus fraternities, has
been wearing a sombrero about the
University. If he does not desist
immediately the Daily Pai.o Alto
intends to publish his name with
the name of his fraternity. The
whole student body is aroused
about this matter, and if the of
fending individual does not take
our advice and discontinue wear
ing the offending hat, he will find
himself in more trouble than he
expects.
