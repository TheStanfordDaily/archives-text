We were looking over the rolls
of two University political clubs a
few days ago and found that al
most every member of either or
ganization was a resident of En
cina Hall. Students from Palo
Alto ought to take a ' more active
interest in these clubs than they
do. The organizations are Uni
versity affairs and every student
should belong to the one which
supports the party he believes in.
They could and should be made
two of the strongest University po
litical clubs in the country. We
have neither enough members nor
enough enthusiasm in either.
