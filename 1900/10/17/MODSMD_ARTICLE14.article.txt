To the Editor of the Daily Palo
Alto: •
The proposition to require the
payment of the annual assessment
in order to vote at a student body
election may he neither as correct
in theory nor as satisfactory in
practice as its supporters claim.
About six hundred assessments
have already been collected this
year and more will in all likeli
hood come in. The vote cast at the
last election was 850, and so the
amendment cannot possibly help
in the collection of more than
about two hundred assessments,
l'robably these persons would stay
away from the polls rather than
pay it. The plan has been tried at
the University of California and
has been far from satisfactory. The
students there have not been able
to collect as large a percentage of
assessments this year as we have,
and when the plan was first adopt
ed the vote at a student body elec
tion was often less than four hun
dred. One of the principal advo
cates of the proposition said a few
days ago that with a restricted bal
lot it would be much easier for a
"push" to run the student body.
A study of the conditions at Berke
ley three years ago when this plan
was first adopted would easily con
vince anyone of the truth of the
above statement. What we want
is to interest everybody in student
body affairs, not to takeaway what
little interest some members of it
have. A Student.
