# DEMOCRACY AND EDUCATION.
## Professor B. E. Howard Points Out the Popular Fallacies Concerning Democracy. 
### 
Following is a summary of Pro
fessor Burt Estes Howard's lecture
on "Democracy and Education"
delivered last evening in the chapel:
Because democracy is the high
est ideal of government, the Ameri
can people delude themselves into
believing it must be continuous re
gardless of their shameful negli
gence in civic duties. The very
form of republic they consider a
talisman against civic evil, whereas
the soul of government lies in the
intelligence and morality of its cit
izens. While democracy is the
highest form of government, it is
most sensitive to the influencing
character of its people, and unless
they will by their lives manifest
the manifest destiny of the nation,
the highest civic possibilities of the
democracy will not be realized.
Democracy, says Professor Howard,
is not the best form of government
alwnys; it is only such for the best
people.
Democracy is a guarantee of
privileges; but while it gives more
than any other form of government,
it demands in return from its citi
zens a large political and moral
responsibility. There are no rights
without corresponding duties. Men
of intelligence seem more anxious
to escape than to perform duties.
The greatest danger to democracy
lies in the apathy of good and able
men toward politics. There is a
great demand for a body of citizens
who will give to the nation their
highest thinking, their holiest liv
ing, and all that is best.
Turning to education, Professor
Howard said it did not put a man
into possession of facts, but in pos
session of his faculties. It means
the evolution of personal forces.
The man with the college diploma
is not necessarily an educated man ;
his sheepskin merely shows that
he is a man who has had a chance
to be educated. When book-learn
ing is transmuted into personal
force it becomes education, and un
der no form of government does
education mean so much to man
and state as under a democracy.
Our modern training tends too
much toward the development of
the commercial capacity. W'e seem
to have harbored the brilliant idea
that the highest function of govern
ment is that of protecting us in
property. But a nation grows
great only in degree as her citizens
grow righteous. Wealth is not a
measure of her greatness. Democ
racy is more than an opportunity
to get rich. There is room for more
patriotism, good honest patriotism.
Not the spirit that revels in
party success, but the love for the
principles for which "Old Glory"
stands. There is need for higher
ideals in politics now as never be
fore. The cause of corrupt politics
is not the growth of plutocracy but
the growth of political imbecility.
All governments get all their pow
ers from the people they govern;
and the government is such as they
actively want. If educated men
and men of business will attend to
their civic duties and not prefer the

gain of wealth, the highest princi
ple of government might he more
nearly realized. What the college
of today needs is higher ideals so
that its students may go forth us
better citizens, ready to work for
their country's highest good.
