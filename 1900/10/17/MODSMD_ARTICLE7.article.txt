# Jack Crawford's Lecture.
## 
### 
Ihe entertainment by Captain
.Jack Crawford announced for next
Friday night will take place in the
chapel on Saturday evening in
stead. The high esteem in which
he is held as an entertainer is
evinced by the following:
"Before the Boston V. M. C. A.,
at its regular weekly entertainment
last night, Capt. 'Jack' Crawford,
the 'poet scout,' delivered one of
his absorbingly interesting talks on
life on the Western plains. He ap
peared in the same costume which
lie wore when he was chief of Ihe
United Slates iirmy scouts, and in
the course of his lecture he illus
trated his rapidity and dexterity in
the ute of his six-shooter. He
showed himself to be a natural en
tertainer, and as apt at that as he is
at Indian fighting, for there was
never a dull moment through the
evening, humor, pathos, and vivid
description being mingled in a way
which kept the audience thrilling
all through his talk. In addition to
bis power as a story-teller, he is
an accomplished humorist, and a
mimic of a high order. He began
by telling of his early life, which
was fn'l of the bitterness of pov
erty, and went on to give some
thrilling tales of his service as a
common soldier through the civil
war. His power of graphic de
ception appeared at its best in his
history of a battle with two thous
and of Sitting Bull's warriors." â€”
