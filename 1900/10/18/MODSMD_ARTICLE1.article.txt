# FOOTBALL.
## The 						Week's Practice Devoted Chiefly to Signal Work and Kicking. 
### 
The week's work in football has
been a trifle irregular on account
of the class games. The second
eleven men have all been practic
ing on the class teams, and in con
sequence the Varsity has had no
one to line up against. The men
have been put through fast signal
practice most of the time, and a
marked improvement in team work
will probably be seen in tomor
row's game.
Hill and Geissler have been do
ing some good punting and have
devoted much time to their kicking
during the week. They are both
good men in this respect and are
about even in their work. Their
punts are frequently for fifty yards
and over.
Cooper and McFadden are both
giving a good account of them
selves at the end positions and
their competitors will have to play
some extraordinary football to beat
either of them out for the place.
De Forest has been playing his
usual consistent and steady game,
but is temporarily out on account
of a bad arm, and will not go into
the game tomorrow for that reason.
Raitt is doing good work at quar
ter. He has been practicing place
kicking most of the week and has
been showing up to a good advan
tage.
The game tomorrow with the
San Jose Normal School eleven
will, of course, be another Stanford
victory, but the score should not
be as one-sided as it was the last
time, as the San .lose team will be
strengthened by the addition of sev
eral new men and they have been
practicing in earnest ever since
their defeat by the Varsity. They
claim that their game tomorrow
will be much better than it was
two weeks ago, and if reports be
true their claims are not wholly
without foundation.
It is also quite possible that the
Normals should score against the
Varsity, as a repetition of some of
the long end runs that were made
might result in a touchdown if they
should occur in the right place.
The game will furnish an excellent
opportunity of getting a line on
the Varsity's improvement during
the week, as it will be the only
time that the Varsity has lined up
since the last game with Reliance.
The game will be called at 8 p.m.
and will not be postponed on ac
count of rain. The teams will line
up as follows:
STANFORD. NORMAL.
