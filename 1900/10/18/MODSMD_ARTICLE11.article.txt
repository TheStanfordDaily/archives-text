As the Faculty has been
gracious enough to grant the re
quest of the students for a holiday
on election day, there need be no
reason why everyone who can pos
sibly should not take advantage of
the opportunity offered and devote
the holiday to good hard work for
the amendment. The recess from
Friday, November 2d, until the
day after election offers a splendid
chance for those who live in the
nearby portions of the State. The
country for a radius of two hun
dred miles ought to be thoroughly
worked over in that time. No one
should wait to be asked if he can
go, but should start out. The wel
fare of the University should be so

dear to every student that there
should be no need of urging.
Every voter should go home to
vote anyway, and then devote the
rest of his time to work in favor of
the amendment.
