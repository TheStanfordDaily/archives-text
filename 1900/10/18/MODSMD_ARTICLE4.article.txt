# CAPTAIN JACK'S MONOLOGUE.
## Tomorrow Night's Entertainment in the Chapel Promises to Be Interesting and Well Attended. 
### 
Although tickets have not been
pi\t on sale in advance for Captain
.Jack Crawford's entertainment, the
amount of interest that has already
been aroused points to a large au
dience in the chapel tomorrow
night.
The Captain is a soldier, an ora
tor, and a writer of prose and verse
of a high order, and has been said
by many to be without a rival as a
thrilling entertainer. One of the
best things that is connected with
"Captain Jack's" monologue is
that he is a part of all that he por
trays, and his remarkable memory
and inimitable wit enable him to
portray the most picturesque scenes
and characters in many of the
most wonderful parts of the history
of our country. He is a connecting
link between the scenes of the past
and the life of the present, and
should be heard by all who have
an interest in getting history at
first-hand.
At present Captain Crawford
is appearing at different points
in the State, and has been
persuaded to appear on the
campus by those who heard his
Palo Alto entertainment last Mon
day night, in order to give a
larger circle a chance to hear him.
He will leave shortly for the East,
where he has many ties among his
comrades in arms of the Civil war,
and of the Indian troubles that later
made the name of Custer immortal.
Captain Jack comes from a race of
fighters, and he himself is a veteran
of the Civil war, a son of a veteran,
as he fought, beside bis father in
the Civil war, and the father of
a veteran of the Spanish war.
He appears here under the
auspices of the Stanford Press
Club, being a brother of the pen
himself. One of his most stirring
adventures was a wild ride with
despatches of the New York Herald,
at the time of the Sitting Hull
war. The story of this ride from
Captain Jack is almost as thrilling
as the ride itself, and he will in
corporate it in bis program tomor
row night as a special treat on ac
count of his sponsors for this en
tertainment at the University.
