# VARSITY WINS.
## Defeats Normal School in a Listless Game, 24-0.â€”Freshman Game Tomorrow. 
### 
Saturday's game between the
Varsity and the eleven from the
San Jose Normal School was in
many respects the poorest exhibi
tion of football that we have seen
this season. The fact that the
team which had defeated Reliance
in two hard-fought games should
go to pieces and play like a lot of
freshmen against a team which
heretofore has played only *'prep"
elevens, and which the Varsity it
self has defeated by a big score, in
dicates a weak spot somewhere.
The Varsity went into the game
expecting a sure-thing victory, and
when it found that it was up
against a harder proposition than
it had looked for, the team went to
pieces, and could not get together
again until a few minutes' rest and
the introduction of some new men
gave the players a chance to get
control of their nerves. The score
in the second half showed conclus
ively that the team can play ball
when it starts right, and this makes
the poor showing in the first half
all the more inexcusable. The
men tried hard to put up the best
possible game, and the fact that
they did not succeed was largely
due to over-confidence at the start,
which resulted in the team's going
to pieces.
Stanford opened the game by
kicking off to the Normal, who
immediately began a line-smashing
advance that made things look
dubious for the cardinal. The
Normal backs plowed through the
Varsity line almost at will, and
big Heston found the right side par
ticularly easy. One of his bucks
gave him an open field with the
exception of Raitt, who downed
him after he had gained twenty
five yards. The Stanford line was
weak and did not give the backs a
chance to get started fairly, and the
backs themselves were slow.
The San Jose team on the other
hand was full of fight and set a hot
pace for the listless Varsity to keep
up with. Heston played the best
game for the visitors, both on the
offensive and defensive. He got
into every play, and it was largely
due to his work that the Normals
were able to keep the Varsity from
scoring in the first half.
When the second half opened,
Stanford putin four new men, Al
len and Luck at the ends and
Geissler and Smith at the halfback
positions. In this half the whole
aspect of the Varsity was changed.
The new men seemed to instil a
fighting spirit into their team
mates, and the others got together
in a way that was refreshing. Raitt
played a dashing game and ran
his team well in this half. Smith,
Geissler, and Slaker alternated in
advancing the ball for big gains,
Smith's bucking and good head
work being particularly noticeable.
Slaker also played a good game,
one of his runs from the kickoff
returning the ball to the middle of
the field. Four touchdowns were
made in this half and Raitt kicked
all of the goals, making the score
24 to 0.

The last Freshman game before
the intercollegiate contest will be
played tomorrow afternoon at
three o'clock. As this is the last
preliminary game it should be
well attended and doubtless will
be. Palo Alto High managed to
play the Freshmen a tie game
earlier in the season and tomor
row's game will furnish a line on
what improvements have been made
in the youngsters' play.
California defeated Reliance, Sat
urday, on the Berkeley campus by
a score of 5-0, made on a fluke
touchdown. Four times the blue
and gold were within striking dis
tance of the Reliance goal but the
clubmen held and punted out of
danger. Smith was the star of
the game, one of his runs with
Pringle's interference netting al
most fifty yards. Great improve
ment was noticeable in the Cali
fornia team, and the Berkeley peo
ple are highly elated over their
prospects.
