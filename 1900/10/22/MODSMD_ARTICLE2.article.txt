Editor Daily Palo Alto:
At a joint meeting of the Faculty
Atliletic Committees of the two
Universities held last Saturday,
there was some discussion as to
whether the committees should at
tempt to distinguish, in the case
of protested men, between those
who were professionals knowingly
and intentionally, and those who
had but their amateur standing
carelessly and through a lack of
knowledge of the rules.
It was the unanimous opinion of
those present that the letter of the
rule should be strictly enforced
and protested men who are in the
opinion of the committee technic
ally professionals will be barred
from intercollegiate contests.
The committees will, however,
recognize the rulings of the
A. A. U. in this regard, and a man
who has once been barred may if
he desires lay his case before the
proper officials of the A. A. U. and,
if they decide that his amateur
standing has not been sacrificed,
he will again be eligible for inter
collegiate contests.
There were two main reasons
that influenced the committees in
reaching their decisions:
First, Strict rulings as to ama
teur standing at the two Universi
ties will give a healthy stimulus
to amateur athletics throughout
the State.
Second, It would be very diffi
cult for the committee to distin
guish justly between intentional
professionals and accidental pro
fessionals.
