## "Personal Creeds" the Subject of Professor Burt Estes Howard's Sermon Yesterday. 
### 
The regular Sunday sermon was
preached in the Chapel by Profes
sor Burt Estes Howard. His sub
ject was "Personal Creeds." He
said:
"A religion without a creed is as
impossible as a circle without a
center. A man without a principle
is a moral imbecile. There seems
to he a notion that the holding of a
creed is a moral disease, something
to he gotten rid of.
" You cannot make a whole, sane
man by removing the backbone
and substituting something infe
rior. There must be a backbone
with a brain at the upper end. A
creed is a. man's backbone of mor
als. It is his sense of moral be
liefs which determines his conduct.
I refer to personal creeds rather
than ecclesiastical creeds. It is
wrong to make man's personal
creed coincide with an ecclesiastical
creed, to make a man say more
than he lives or believes. A man's
creeds are his convictions. The
mere opinion of men is of small
moment. The personal creed of a
man is more important than the
printed creed of his church. Creeds
are an attempt to articulate in
form what the church has dogmat
ically thought. They have gath
ered much that is worthless and
much that is good. The fault is
not with the creed; it is with those
who insist that we shall eat all, re
gardless of our stomachs.
"Ecclesiastical creeds do not afford
any idea of character, they afford
no pledge of character; they are
physical or metaphysical, not ethi
cal; they dwell on the Trinity or
the nature of the penalty Christ
paid and its atonement, or the col
lision between the human will and
the Divine. Jf any person declines
assent to any or all of the professed
creeds and offers adherence to
Jesus' creed in the Sermon on the
Mount, no dogmatic church would
admit him as a minister to their
pulpit. Can you imagine Christ
interposing tests of creeds?
"To make a fixed dogmatic sys
tem a test of Christianity is a seri
ous error. It can have no other
effect than to make men intel
lectually dishonest. It is absurd,
this importing of a ready-made
creed as a test of religion. There
is no more sense in it than in im
posing the same size clothes for all
men. If David can fight well
enough with slings, why must, we
burden him with Saul's armor?
iVlan should be free to take what
is needful without being compelled
to take all. Creeds must be sub
ordinated to this end, to make men
and not religion. There must be
an inevitable creed or there is no
manhood.
"To believe in God and man and
our own selves, and faith in the
ultimate reign of righteousness and
then live up to it, is what makes
our lives mean something. The
spirit that leaps into the thick of
the fight against evil and injustice
in the world, resolved to die if need
be, knowing th;it he is faithful to a
great cause, has not lost its worth."
