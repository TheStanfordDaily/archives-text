# University Band.

### 
Manager Kramer of (he Univer
sity band was informed today that
the uniforms would be on the
campus tomorrow. Twenty-five
uniforms were ordered, which con
sist of a red blouse trimmed in
black, on the collar of which are
the letters, U. I>. The cap is red,
with a Stanford k \S" above a short
visor. The trousers are to be duck.
There are already thirty-five
members in the band, so a try-out
will be necessary to bring the num
ber down to the twenty-five. Man
ager Fraser thinks that the differ
ence in the quality of the band
thereby will more than make up
for the difference in number. The
successful twenty-five will go to the
Freshman game and act as the reg
ular band from that time on. The
band has shown much enthusiasm
lately, especially at practices. They
have received much new music,
which they will play about twice a
week on the bleachers as soon as
they have .practiced sufficiently.
