The active interest taken by the
students of the University of Cali
fornia in the Stanford amendment
as shown by their attitude at Dr.
Jordan's recent address at Berkeley
and their earnest offers of assist
ance that have come to us from
different members of the Berkeley
student body, is sure to be appreci
ated by the student body here. In
this movement for Stanford's wel
fare we need the support and active
co-operation of all the people of the
State, and especially of the Univer
sity of California. The State Uni
versity, from its very position as
an official part of the State organi
zation, can by its attitude do much
for or against the proposition.
Therefore the fact that, for the mo
ment at least, whatever there is of
petty jealousy or rivalry is laid
aside and the two great universities
stand together at a time of great
moment to one of them is a cause
for great satisfaction. That Cal
ifornia's attitude means much to
Stanford there can he little doubt,
and there should be some effort
made to show her appreciation.
