# STUDENTS TAKE ACTION.
## The 						Four Classes Hold Meetings and Petition the Faculty to Rescind Its Action. 
### 
The action of the Faculty Com
mittee 011 Student Affairs in expel
ling certain of the upperclass-men
for participating in the so-called
Freshman-Sophomore "rush" has
aroused the whole student body.
Many students feel that the action
of the committee was in some re
spects unjust.
This afternoon tiie four classes
met in several rooms about the
quadrangle, and in every instance
adopted resolutions lending to
wards a formal understanding be
tween the students and faculty dis
countenancing rushes,and begging
the faculty committee in the light
of this action to reconsider their
expulsion of upper-classmen for
taking part in the affair. The
resolutions are all alike in senti
ment, if not in words. The one
adopted by the Junior class is as
follows:
Whereas, owing to a recent exhi
bition of class rivalry and spirit
between the Sophomores and
Freshmen of the University, some
prominent upper-classmen have
been visited with the severest of
college punishment, and
Whereas, there seems to be a gen
eral feeling that the attitude of the
faculty towards rushing has not
been fully understood and appreci
ated by the students, be it
Resolved, That we, the Junior
Class, deprecate in the highest de
gree any breach of friendly rela
tions between the faculty and the
student body; and express the hope
that hereafter there shall be a per
fect unity of opinion established in
regard to rushing and hazing
which shall forever banish them
from the University; and we fur
ther sincerely hope that in consid
eration of the above your committee
shall think best to reconsider the
action which you have taken, a
move which we believe and trust
will be for the best interests of the
IJ ni versity.
