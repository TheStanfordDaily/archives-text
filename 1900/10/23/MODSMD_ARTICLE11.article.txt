The action of the University of
California in protesting M. E. J)e
Witt is no doubt but a retaliatory
measure after Stanford's protest of
Overall. However, the action of
the Berkeley management is with
out effect, for the terms of the ath
letic agreement made last spring
expressly states that"'the manager
objecting must make his objection
in writing within one week after
receiving the names." The names
of Stanford's players have been in
the hands of the Berkeley manage
ment already over two weeks,
therefore there can be no reason
why l)e Witt should not play next
Saturday, if the management here
stands firmly on its rights and ad
heres to the strict letter of the
agreement. This they should and
must do. There should be no rep
etition of the submissive action of
last year. A determined stand on
the matter is necessary, if Stan
ford's point is to be carried, and
our faculty committee should see
that this stand is taken.
