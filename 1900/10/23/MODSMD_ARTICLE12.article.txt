## 
### 
Dane Coolidge, '98, who has been
away on a three weeks' collecting
trip in eastern Kern county, has
turned to the University. His ob
ject was the securing of several
varieties of rodents of the squirrel
family for the New York Zoological
Society.
On account of the early cold
weather, he was hindered by the
animals being in a dormant condi
tion, but his efforts were neverthe
less fairly successful, fifteen live
squirrels having just been shipped
to \V. T. Hornaday, president of
the New York Society.
During the next few weeks Cool
idge will make the University. his
headquarters, with a view to col
lecting in the northern counties
later in the fall.
