# Captain Crawford's Lecture.
## 
### 
A combination of circumstances,
including a Democratic rally in
Mayfield, a faculty "at home," sev
en! dances, and a Christian Asso
ciation social in Palo Alto, worked
against a large attendance at the
entertainment given by Captain
Crawford in the chapel last Satur
day. Those who did go were more
than repaid, however, by the won
derful monologue which they heard.
After several verses and anec
dotes. which showed "Captain
Jack" to be a finished raconteur,
he came to the feature of the even
ing, an account of his ride with
dispatches for the New York Her
ald. In prefacing this account
with the story of the Indian fight
that was told of in the dispatches,
he irave a vivid picture of a mar
velous encounter, thrilling in the
extreme. Just as everything hap
pened, so was it told, for as "Cap
tain Jack" said, "1 haven't told

this story for several years, and if
I get off the trail 1 get lost."
The audience was spell-bound
and breathless at the escapades of
the great ride from near the Little
Big Horn to Fort Laramie, and
listened eagerly as to a wonderful
romance, which had the truth in it
that is always stranger than fiction.
They lost sight of the entertainer,
and followed through all his vicis
situdes at the hands of Indians and
white enemies, the lone scout who
was proceeding in the face of what
seemed certain death. When the
story of the safe delivery of the dis
patches came, the audience broke
into applause not only for the
speaker, hut for the bravery of the
rider.
For two hours Captain Crawford
held his audience in rapt attention,
closing with his famous representa
tion of the killing of two men in
two seconds, by the notorious Wild
Bill.
