The following self-explanatory
letter has been received from
Charles K. Field, '95. It might he
stated that the verse alluded to is
in reality the work of H. I). Wal
ter, '01.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In reading through the new
song-hook 1 find that I am the
author of ".Just One Mile." 1 sup
pose my admiration for the concen
trated merit of this quatrain,
joined to the nature of the rightful
owner, have given me this unde
served honor. On several occa
sions I have had to deny this au
thorship, regretting that honesty
rather than modesty necessitated
the denial. Will you kindly make
this correction to the college and
do justice to the "mute inglorious
Milton." The triumph is not
mine. Sincerely,
Charles K. Field.
