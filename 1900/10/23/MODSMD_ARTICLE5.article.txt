# CALIFORNIA PROTESTS.
## M.E. De Witt, Freshman Halfback, Accused of Professionalism. 
### 
Since the action of the Stanford
| Committee in protesting Orval Ov
erall, the star athlete upon whom
the California people have been
counting for so much, the athletic
authorities across the hay have
been coasting about for a Stanford
man whose standing as an amateur
might be questioned. As a result
of their labors they have collected
evidence to show that M. E. De
Witt, one of the most promising
candidates for halfback on the
Freshman team, is a professional.
The documents were sent to the
Stanford Faculty Committee yes
terday afternoon, and state in sub
stance that De Witt is guilty of
participating in a "hose race" be
tween two rival fire departments
where the winning team, of which
De Witt was a member, received
$100 as a cash prize. Furthermore,
the affidavit of a member of the
opposing team is produced, which
states that he himself was a profes
sional athlete at the time of the
contest and took part in the race
against De Witt. It is alleged that
De Witt participated in similar
contests at other times, all in Visa
lia, the same place in which Over
all did his professional work.
What action the Stanford commit
tee will take is as yet unknown.
The student body is justly
aroused over the fact that the Berk
eley committee, after having sug
gested the clause in the intercolleg
iate agreement providing for arbi
tration of protests, should be the
first to attempt to evade their own
arrangements when they are likely
to suffer if they remain bound by
them. Colonel Edwards of the
Berkeley committee first proposed
that all jurisdiction be taken from
the Amateur Athletic Union and
Pacific Athletic Association, and
now when there is a chance to have
Overall's amateur standing restored
by referring to the A. A. IT., Mr.
Edwards is the man who moves to
overthrow the agreement. As it
stands now, as stated in last night's
Palo Alto, Overall may regain his
amateur standing if the A. A. U.
officials decide in his favor, and if
this is done in time, his playing in
future contests will not be barred.
Football practice last night was
given over to signal practice and
developing team work. An enthu
siastic crowd was on the bleachers,
and the presence of the Glee Club
livened up the rooting appreciably
The Southern Pacific offers a
rate to the city on next Saturday,
the day of the Freshman game, of
one dollar, round trip, good return
ing on any train Saturday. Any
desiring to return later than Sat
urday will have to pay the regu
lar one-dollar-and-twenty -five-cent
rate*
