# Sophomore Canes.
## 
### 
The Sophomore canes that were
ordered last year and were returned
as not being up to the sample sub
mitted, have arrived from the East
and will be on sale at the Univer
sity Drugstore Thursday or Friday
morning at the latest.
It appears that last year the

class of 1903 ordered fifty-seven
canes, and of that number
thirty-one were returned as
unsatisfactory. As it was at the
end of the college year the new
canes could not be obtained until
after the University had closed.
But after much delay, H. M. Slem
ons, who has been in charge of the
matter, has finally succeeded in se
curing canes that will be satis
factory. All those who have or
dered canes should get them at once.
