# ANOTHER TIE.
## Palo Alto High School Plays the Freshmen a Standstill. Score 6-6. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon, in the last
preliminary game before their in
tercollegiate contest, the Freshman
eleven disappointed its supporters
by allowing the Palo Alto high
school team to wipe up the grid
iron with them, and they were
only saved from a 6-0 defeat by
what is claimed by Palo Alto to
be an unjust decision of Umpire
Parkin. As it was, the 6-6 score
was not an indication of the rela
tive strength of the two teams as
the high school hail the best of the
argument from the start, with one
or two brief exceptions when the
Freshmen worked down within
striking distance of their oppon
ent's goal.
The chief fault of the Freshmen
is that they had almost no sem
blance of defensive work except
in two or three individual in
stances. When the ball was in
their possession they were fairly
good at advancing it. On the de
fensive, however, they lacked the
ability to smash into the play be
fore it.was well started and could
not bold their line together when
a hard buck struck it. On nearly
every buck of the Palo Alto backs,
the Freshman line failed to stop
the man with the ball and almost
all the good tackling was done by
the backs.
For the Freshmen, Lunt, though
lame, played his usual strong and,
at times, brilliant game. Kenne
dy's play was also excellent, while
Lemmon and Whit lock played well,
both on the offensive and defensive.
For Palo Alto, )). Tarpey at right
tackle and G. Tarpey at right half
played good ball. Wylie at the
other half came up to his company
and made Palo Alto's touchdown
by a pretty buck and a run through
an open field.
The game was a succession of
rushes from one end of the held to
the other, neither side being able to
stop the other's rushes until its
goal was in imminent danger; then
it would hold and the ball would
go in the other direction as rapidly
as it had come. Within a few
minutes of the close of the half, the
ball was on the Freshman thirtv
live-yard line when Wylie found a
hole in the Cardinal line and went
through like a shot. Before the
Freshmen knew what had hap
pened he was sprinting towards
the goal line, with no one ahead of
him The goal was kicked, making
the score 6-0 in Palo Alto's favor.
This first score of the season against
a Stanford team seemed to give the
Cardinal team a new lease of life.
They went at the Nigh School line
like fiends and in a short time had
their opponents' goal in danger.
Here it was that the incidents oc
curred which Palo Alto claimed
deprived them of a victory. The
Freshmen were given the ball and
ten yards on account of offside
play and holding in the line, and
quickly made a touchdown. Pat
terson kicked the goal, making the
score 6-6. The game was contin
ued some time in the attempt to
play off the tie, but was stopped on

account of darkness, with no fur
ther score.

The statement in the morning
papers to the effect that the Fresh
men were given an unfair advan
tage in the game through a decision
of Umpire \V. M. Parker, has been
the subject of much discussion both
in Palo Alto and on the campus.
So far as can he ascertained the
charge of unfairness on the part of
the umpire is unsubstantiated.
When seen this afternoon in regard
to the matter, Mr. Parkin made
the following explanation:
"It is charged that a mistake was
made in giving the Freshmen the
ball as a penalty for an offside
play. The ball was not given to
them under any such circum
stances, Palo Alto forfeiting the
ball for holding in the line by
Tarpey at tackleâ€”the proper pen
alty. Jn the succeeding play there
was an offside by the same man
and the penalty of ten yards was
inflicted. Not only Tarpey but
others on the High School team
had been repeatedly warned for
holding and playing offside."
The next gridiron contest of in
terest to Stanford people is the
Varsity-Alumni game, Friday af
ternoon. Varsity players of former
years, who have made places for
themselves in Stanford football
history, will be in the game stud
every one should take advantage
of this opportunity of seeing the
"old men" play whose names are
so familiar to every football enthu
siast. The band and Glee Club
will be out, the band in new uni
forms. The rooters will be divided
into two sections, the Seniors and
Sophomores to yell for the Alumni
and the Juniors and Freshmen to
support the Varsity.
The Freshman game next Satur
day is the first intercollegiate con
test of the year, and it is probable
that the University will be well
represented on the bleachers. Ev
ery one who can do so should go to
the game prepared to give his share
of support to the team. The idea
that we are sure to be beaten, which
a few people seem to entertain, is
utterly without foundation, as the
Freshmen have the spirit and de
termination and will undoubtedly
make things interesting for the
Mine and Gold.
