# DeWitt Not Eligible.
## 
### 
The Faculty Committee has de
cided that DeWitt is not eligible to
play in the Freshman football
game next. Saturday. A member
of the committee said there was no
doubt but that DeWitt took part
in the "hose race" for a, cash prize,
and, since it must literally be
called an athletic contest, this
would make him a professional.
It seems that the football mana
ger had the list of eligibles re
turned to him after it was sent to

Berkeley so that lie could insert
another name. The protest against
DeVVitt was sent in within one
week after the corrected list was
received at Berkeley and so it will
be impossible to play him next
Saturday.
