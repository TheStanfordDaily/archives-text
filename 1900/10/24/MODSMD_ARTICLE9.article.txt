It seems that the song practice
that started out bo auspiciously
and was hailed as the beginning of
anew and delightful college cus
tom is destined to fail. Of course
a great deal of the first enthusiasm
at the beginning has dwindled
away, for no one cares to sit out of
doors these cool evenings and sing
songs out of pure delight of estab
lishing a new custom. However,
the truth remains that the idea
was not very enthusiastically re
ceived, and il, seems doomed to fall
through. Perhaps, and it is to be
hoped that it will be, the custom
may be revived and made perma
nent when the warm days of spring
are here. However, there is cause
for comfort in the fact that the stu
dents, especially in Encina, are
learning the college songs and are
singing better than for some years
past. There is no reason why the
custom of holding nightly song
practice should not be adopted in
other places besides Encina. There
can be nothing more delightful
than good singing by a body of
students, and singing has always
been a feature of the big football
games between the Eastern univer
sities. Not much interest has ever
been taken in singing here, how
ever, and the attempts to start sing
ing at football games have been
generally fiat failures, due mainly
to the fact that the students do not
know the songs they try to sing.
However, if the practices keep up,
there is no doubt that Stanford
will soon be able to render a few of
its songs in a creditable manner.
When that time comes there will
perhaps be more desire to establish
the custom of singing on Encina
steps.
