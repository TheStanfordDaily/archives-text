## Varsity and Second Eleven Line Up.—Alumni vs. Varsity.—Freshman Game Saturday. 
### 
Last night saw the first line-up
of the Varsity for several days, and
the play, though a trifle ragged at
times, was fast and snappy. The
Varsity was able to advance the
ball almost al will and made sev
eral touchdowns. The second did
not hold together, and long runs
through an open field werecommon.
Geissler did some very good work
behind the line and Mill's punting
was of a high order. Hill keeps
his head very well in punting and
with the development that should
come with practice he will be a
strong kicker. Lee is putting up a
belter game at center than before,
but there is still room for improve
ment in the snap-back position.
For the second, Wardall played a.
tierce game, but his eagerness led
him offside at almost every play.
The presence of Professor Lewers in
the line on the second materially
strengthened the team. Last
night's line-up was as follows:
McFadden 1 « r Nourse
Traeger 1 t r... . Hauverman
Emerson 1 g r Lewers
Lee c Gregory
Seeley r g 1 Thompson
Nutter r t 1 Bent ley
Cooper r el Knight
Raitt, q Crawford
Geissler 1 hr Campbell
Smith r h 1 Wardall
