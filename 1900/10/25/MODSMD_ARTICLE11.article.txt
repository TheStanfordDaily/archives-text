Tomorrow night will be the oc
casion of a big jolly-up at Encina
Hall, followed by a bonfire on the
old football field. All University
men should be present, and every
one should do his part toward
making it the most enthusiastic
rally ever held at Stanford. This
is the first one we have had here
this yenr, and probably the only
one until just before the Thanks
giving day game. We are on the
verge of an intercollegiate contest,
and every one should be ready to
show his support to the Freshman
team. It has been training faith
fully and will do all in its power
to bring back a victory. But no
team can be expected to win by
itself, least of all one whose mem
bers have been amongst us less
than two months. What is needed
is a stimulant such as the united
efforts of every man in the Univer
sity alone can give, and this m.ust
be given to our baby team tomor
row evening.
