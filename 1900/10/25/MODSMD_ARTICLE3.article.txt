# Freshman Intercollegiate Game.
## 
### 
Saturday is (lie day of the first
intercollegiate contest of the yearj
and a l>ig crowd should be in the j
city to help support the Freshmen ;
in their initial game with the Blue'
and Gold. The youngsters are!
trying hard to get into shape, and
are having team work drilled into
them at the hands of Coach Yost.
They should put up a snappy, fast
game, and should give a good ac

count of themselves. They know
how to play a hard game if neces
sary, and have plenty of nerve in
emergencies. The outcome of the
game is of course doubtful, but it
must be conceded that our chances
are not so slim as they are consid
ered to lÂ»e by many. If Berkeley
wins, she will have to play hard,
fiist football from start to finish.
