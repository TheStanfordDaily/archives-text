# SATURDAY'S VAUDEVILLE
## Arrangements Are Progressing Very Favorably. â€”Tickets on Sale Tomorrow. 
### 
The preliminary arrangements
I for the combined Berkeley and I
| Stanford entertainment on .Satur
day evening after the Freshman
game are progressing most favora
bly. A great deal of interest is
being taken in it in the city be
cause of its unique character. The
Berkeley alumni and students have
seized the opportunity to show
that, whatever slight difference
there may occasionally lie between j
the two colleges, they are heart and !
soul with us in the movement for j
the passage of the amendment, j
They have contributed their best
talent, and also intend to strongly
support us through the box office
as well.
This show is directly for our ben
efit, and we must not be second to
Berkeley in our support of it. The
student body has not done all that
it should in i lie work for the pass
age of the amendment. There is
now an opportunity to help the
Club defray some of the expenses
which it has incurred already and
also to give it a chance to do some
effective work between now and
election. Without this money the
Club will be much crippled in its
work. It lias not called upon the
students at all until this time for
financial support. Now through
the loyalty of a few of the students
here and of the San Francisco
alumni of both colleges, the Club
is able to offer a show which is
worth all that is charged, and more
too. It is confidently expected
that every student who has the
true interests of the University at
heart will come forward and buy
tickets, whether he can go to the
show or not. The Club has hith
erto worked under the greatest dif
ficulties, and feels that it is now
asking very little of the students in
proportion to what is at stake.
Aside from the financial aspect
of the case, a large and enthusias
tic- audience Saturday night will
help the cause of the amendment
in San Francisco very much, while
a small crowd will hurt us, since it
is thoroughly advertised in the city
that the show is for the benefit of
the amendment.
Tickets are to be placed on sale
tomorrow morning from 8:15 toi
12:15 at the corner of the Law'
building, and also at the Alumni
game in the afternoon. The great
er part of the seats are on sale at
Sherman & Clay's in the city, but
when the tickets sent down here
are exhausted, coupons entitling
the holders to reserved seats on
application to Sherman A: Clay on
Saturday, or to the box office on
the evening of the show, will be
sold here.
