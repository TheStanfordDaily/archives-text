# FRESHMAN GAME.
## 1904 Meets Berkeley's Freshmen in San Francisco Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
What will be the outcome of the
Intercollegiate Freshman game to
morrow afternoon is one of the
most uncertain questions that ever
vexed Stanford football circles.
We have a fast, light team, full of
the spirit of determination that has
often won games. Team work has
been drilled into them till it should
be an instinct. There are three or
four fierce players who will proba
bly give a good account of them
selves in advancing the ball, and
every man in the team knows his
place in the interference. The
doubtful part of the work is the
defense. What the line can do
towards blocking tiie rushes of the
Berkeley backs is an absolutely
unknown quantity. There are
some heavy men in the center trio
who should be able to take care of
their part of the work, while Ken
nedy and Hall both have the
strength and aggressiveness that
are necessary for tackles. The
ends are a trifle slow, but get into
the play in good shape. The backs
are all heady players and full of
fight. On the whole, the Freshmen
ought to be able to put up a good
defense, but a new team is always
uncertain in this respect, and this
year's light one is 110 exception.
The men are all in good condi
tion as far as health goes. Clark
and Lunt are the only ones who.
are suffering*"from injuries. They
both have bad ankles, and this
may interfere with their work to
some extent. Lunt is one of the
best all-round men on the team,
and Di) the defense will play at
halfback, while a man with good
ankles will play the end. Lunt is
sure to be valuable behind the line
on account of his superb defensive
work.
Coach Yost will not say that he
expects the Freshmen to win, be
cause California's weight is going
to be greatly in her favor. The
youngsters are gritty and game,
however, and will tight for the last
inch. The defensive work, he says,
has improved in the last three days,
and ihey will play a cool and
heady game unless, all indications
are false.
