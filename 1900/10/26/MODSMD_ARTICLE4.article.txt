# JUNIOR PLUG UGLY
## Will Be Given on the Oval Next Monday Night.â€”Outline of the Plot. 
### 
The Junior Class will give its
Plug Ugly next Monday evening at
7:30, before the bleachers in the
oval. The skit is written by F. B.
Wagner and embodies entirely new
ideas. It represents the class as
the tribe of Naw Teetoo, and is so
arranged that every man can get
in the action. The play opens
with six old chiefs seated before a
camp-fire. They recite lines which
give the audience the cue to the
plot; the tribe is absent hunting a
hoodoo that has oppressed their
clan. As the old chiefs scout
about the camp-fire, two runners
enter with news that the braves are
coming back with spoils and sev
eral hoodoos, besides a "pale-face."
Then in the distance is heard the
class yell and soon the tribe ap
pears 011 the scene.
"Pale-face" is now questioned
about the hoodoos, and explains
the first one as a peculiar, pedantic
pedal propellor. In the mix-up
that follows, "pale-face" is con
demned to die, but is saved by
Pocahontas. The second hoodoo is
a perpendicular, polyangular, pest
iferous unpopular poplar post from
the Palo Alto path, and the third a
hounding bulb of brown, a popular
pastime for pugnacious people.
During an aboriginal football game
"pale-face" tries to escape, but is
caught, tortured, and burned alive.
But fire does not phase him, and
he promises to reveal the cause of
evil to the tribe if they will release
hini- This is done and he tells the
braves that they need a distinctive
mark of Juniordom. Then he ded
icates the Junior Plug with appro
priate ceremonies.
The Plug Ugly is replete with
joshes, yells, and chorus work.
The scenic effects will be above the
average. As it is held in the oval,
and the class will lie at considera
ble expense in addition to cos
tumes, an admission fee of ten
cents will be charged at the gate.
