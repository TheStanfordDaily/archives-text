# Sunday Morning Chapel.
## 
### 
The address to be given on Sun
day morning by Mr. Henry Wein
stock of Sacramento should be of
unusual interest. It is an estimate
and appreciation by one who has
come to the study of Jesus from a
point of view quite foreign to that
of the ordinary Christian. Mr.
NVeinstock was brought up in strict
Jewish circles embittered by centu
ries of persecution against every
thing connected with the name of
Jesus. Mr. YVeinstock is a Jew,
and to him Jesus is primarily a
Jewish prophet and teacher, but
the appeal which the character
and personality of Jesus make to
the open-minded truth-seeking Jew
is the same as that which has in
spired the noblest type of Christi
anity.
Mr. NVeinstock will be the guest
of President Jordan during his
stay at the University.
