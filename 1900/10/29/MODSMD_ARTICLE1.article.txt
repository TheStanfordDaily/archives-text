Possibly the greatest football
surprise that ever came Stanford's
way was the defeat of (he Califor
nia freshman football team by our
own youngsters last Saturday
afternoon. The score of 5-0 in our
favor, when a bigger score was ex
pected the other way, tells the story
of a season's hard work on the part
of coaches and men. Team work,
systematic and accurate, with elev
en men in every play, on the part
of Stanford, and individual work
which, no matter how brilliant,
could not stand unsupported, on
the part of Berkeley, explains how
the cardinal jerseys forced their
slow but sure way across the Cali
fornia goal. Berkeley was confident
of a victory, for they claim that
this year's aggregation was the best
freshman team that ever repre
sented them, while Stanford was
hoping against hope that we might
at least prevent more than one
touchdown against us. The result
could be seen in the relative num
bers from the two colleges who
watched the game. California's
rooters outnumbered, and of course
made more noise on that account.
Their yelling was more systematic,
however, than our own. One good
yell leader for the entire section
gives more satisfactory results than
does the attempt of individuals to
lead portions of the crowd regard
less of what the regular leader is
attempting. Such work disorgan
izes the section and interferes with
the systematic work that would
otherwise be done. Our band,
while no better trained than was
the Berkeley organization, was bet
ter balanced as to parts, and the
red uniforms were a striking con
trast to the military blue of the
Berkeleyans.
At three o'clock the game was
called, California having the kick
off. Stovve kicked to Kennedy,
who ran in eight yards before he
was downed by Savage. Bansbach
tried a buck on Berkeley's right
tackle, but lost the ball on a fum
ble on California's thirty-yard line.
Berkeley tried to advance twice for
short gains, but fumbled and lost
the ball to Patterson. Lunt went
over Savage for three yards, and
went through Ramsaur for five
more. Lunt and Stanford in suc
cession failed to make more than
two yards, and Patterson punted
thirty yards to Fautz, who was
downed in his tracks. Fautz
kicked in return for thirty-two
yards to Bansbach. On a delayed
pass. Bansbach made five yards
and Lunt tore off three more over
Savage. In seven succeeding plays
the Cardinal advanced thirty-four
yards, when Berkeley took the ball

on downs on her own twenty-five
yard line.
At this juncture the tide seemed
to be turning in favor of the Blue
and Gold, for Fautz went around
Patterson for twenty-five yards.
Then Sherman went over Hall for
ten, and Berkeley went wild.
Fautz went through center for
seven yards, but fumbled, and like
a flash Bansbach was oil the ball.
Lemmon and Kennedy made it
first down in two tries, Kennedy
was good for five more, and Bans
bach annexed four on a delayed
pass. Stanford's hopes went up.
Fast and furious team work was
beginning to tell. Kennedy, Lem
mon, Frederickson, and Lunt went
over and through the Berkeley line
and landed the bail on the thirty
yard line. Two bucks over Savage
and one over Phillips netted seven
yards. Two more plays, and Lem
mon placed the pigskin within
twelve yards of the goal. Lemmon
was tried again, but was forced
back for a loss of three yards by
Hector. Bansbach made it first
down on a delayed pass, seven
yards from the line. Kennedy was
given the ball and on a magnificent
buck went over Ramsaur for a
touchdown. Patterson failed to
kick the goal. Score. 5-0.
Phillips kicked off thirty-seven
yards. Stanford tried the right
side of Berkeley's line repeatedly
for gains, rushing the ball to the
forty-five-yard line, when time was
called with the ball in Stanford's
possession.
McFadden kicked off at the be
ginning of the second half to Row
land, who was downed on the
twenty-five-yard line by Young
and McFadden. Sherman was
sent at Lunt, but Lunt forced him
back two yards. Fautz went
through center for ten yards and
was downed by Lunt. Whipple
tried Patterson's end, but Stanford
tackled him behind the line for a
loss of three yards. Berkeley here
made some fast plays, netting fif
teen yards. Lunt was injured at
this point and forced to give place
to Moore. Fautz went through
center for six and Sherman skirted
Moore for five when Frederickson
downed him. The joy of the Berke
ley grandstand at this big gain
was short-lived, for Umpire Hall
gave the ball to Stanford fifteen
yards back, for holding by Row
land. From this time 011 every
thing went Stanford's way. Berke
ley held three times but could not
smash the Cardinal line. Sherman
made a twenty-five-yard run past
Moore, but the ball soon went to
Stanford on downs, and again the
red jerseys began to smash the
Berkeley line, till it in turn took
the ball on downs. Clark was
forced to retire with an injured
knee after a gritty game, and
"Stew" Taylor took his place. Tay
lor went into (lie game with com
mendable eagerness and his hard,
low bucking was used to good

advantage. Berkeley tried to pen
etrate the Stanford line, but was
forced to kick. An exchange of
puntß and a fumble by Rowland
gave the ball to Stanford in the
middle of the field. Stanford was
forced to kick. Rowland tried a
delayed pass but fumbled and
McFadden fell on the ball on the
frrty-five-yard line. Lemmon went
through for a ten-yard gain. Time
was called with the ball in Stan
ford's "possession on Berkeley's
thirty-yard line.
Immediately the Stanford root
ers thronged on to the gridiron and
headed by the band marched
around the field carrying Coach
Yost and Captain Bansbach on
their shoulders. A procession was
immediately formed outside the
gale and with the team in an ex
press wagon and the band at the
head marched down town, where a
' jolly-up" was held in the court
of the Palace Motel.
It is difficult to mention indi
viduals of the team who played
the best games. McFadden at cen
ter was everywhere at the right
time and played an excellent de
fensive game, after tackling behind
the line, and generally putting two
or three of the Berkeley line men
out of the waj' at once. Bansbach
at quarter was remarkably cool
and ran his team like a veteran.
To his generalship is due no small
amount of credit for the victory.
Kennedy's bucks were always for
good gains and his defensive work
was of a high order. Stanford
played a great game at half, his
defense being particularly bril
liant. He also did splendid ser
vice in running with the ball.
These four were perhaps the most
noticeable, but every man in the
team played good ball and no one
was far ahead of the rest. This in
a manner accounted for the team
work of the Stanford men.
Great credit is due the coaches
for their work with the Freshmen.
There was not a star in the squad
at the beginning of the season, and
the clock-like precision with which
the plays were executed shows
where consistent training has done
its work. Every man knew his
place and not a play was made
that did not find ten men helping
the runner along.
In Sherman, Whipple, and
Stowe, Berkeley had three men who
last year were rated as the best at
their positions in the Academic
League. They showed Saturday
that their reputations were not un
earned, but without support they
could not be expected to accom
plish much.

center for six and Sherman skirted
Moore for five when Frederickson
downed him. The joy of the Berke
ley grandstand at this big gain
was short-lived, for Umpire Hall
gave the ball to Stanford fifteen
yards back, for holding by Row
land. From this time 011 every
thing went Stanford's way. Berke
ley held three times but could not
smash the Cardinal line. Sherman
made a twenty-five-yard run past
Moore, but the ball soon went to
Stanford on downs, and again the
red jerseys began to smash the
Berkeley line, till it in turn took
the ball on downs. Clark was
forced to retire with an injured
knee after a gritty game, and
"Stew" Taylor took his place. Tay
lor went into (lie game with com
mendable eagerness and his hard,
low bucking was used to good

advantage. Berkeley tried to pen
etrate the Stanford line, but was
forced to kick. An exchange of
puntß and a fumble by Rowland
gave the ball to Stanford in the
middle of the field. Stanford was
forced to kick. Rowland tried a
delayed pass but fumbled and
McFadden fell on the ball on the
frrty-five-yard line. Lemmon went
through for a ten-yard gain. Time
was called with the ball in Stan
ford's "possession on Berkeley's
thirty-yard line.
Immediately the Stanford root
ers thronged on to the gridiron and
headed by the band marched
around the field carrying Coach
Yost and Captain Bansbach on
their shoulders. A procession was
immediately formed outside the
gale and with the team in an ex
press wagon and the band at the
head marched down town, where a
' jolly-up" was held in the court
of the Palace Motel.
It is difficult to mention indi
viduals of the team who played
the best games. McFadden at cen
ter was everywhere at the right
time and played an excellent de
fensive game, after tackling behind
the line, and generally putting two
or three of the Berkeley line men
out of the waj' at once. Bansbach
at quarter was remarkably cool
and ran his team like a veteran.
To his generalship is due no small
amount of credit for the victory.
Kennedy's bucks were always for
good gains and his defensive work
was of a high order. Stanford
played a great game at half, his
defense being particularly bril
liant. He also did splendid ser
vice in running with the ball.
These four were perhaps the most
noticeable, but every man in the
team played good ball and no one
was far ahead of the rest. This in
a manner accounted for the team
work of the Stanford men.
Great credit is due the coaches
for their work with the Freshmen.
There was not a star in the squad
at the beginning of the season, and
the clock-like precision with which
the plays were executed shows
where consistent training has done
its work. Every man knew his
place and not a play was made
that did not find ten men helping
the runner along.
In Sherman, Whipple, and
Stowe, Berkeley had three men who
last year were rated as the best at
their positions in the Academic
League. They showed Saturday
that their reputations were not un
earned, but without support they
could not be expected to accom

Possibly the greatest football
surprise that ever came Stanford's
way was the defeat of (he Califor
nia freshman football team by our
own youngsters last Saturday
afternoon. The score of 5-0 in our
favor, when a bigger score was ex
pected the other way, tells the story
of a season's hard work on the part
of coaches and men. Team work,
systematic and accurate, with elev
en men in every play, on the part
of Stanford, and individual work
which, no matter how brilliant,
could not stand unsupported, on
the part of Berkeley, explains how
the cardinal jerseys forced their
slow but sure way across the Cali
fornia goal. Berkeley was confident
of a victory, for they claim that
this year's aggregation was the best
freshman team that ever repre
sented them, while Stanford was
hoping against hope that we might
at least prevent more than one
touchdown against us. The result
could be seen in the relative num
bers from the two colleges who
watched the game. California's
rooters outnumbered, and of course
made more noise on that account.
Their yelling was more systematic,
however, than our own. One good
yell leader for the entire section
gives more satisfactory results than
does the attempt of individuals to
lead portions of the crowd regard
less of what the regular leader is
attempting. Such work disorgan
izes the section and interferes with
the systematic work that would
otherwise be done. Our band,
while no better trained than was
the Berkeley organization, was bet
ter balanced as to parts, and the
red uniforms were a striking con
trast to the military blue of the
Berkeleyans.
At three o'clock the game was
called, California having the kick
off. Stovve kicked to Kennedy,
who ran in eight yards before he
was downed by Savage. Bansbach
tried a buck on Berkeley's right
tackle, but lost the ball on a fum
ble on California's thirty-yard line.
Berkeley tried to advance twice for
short gains, but fumbled and lost
the ball to Patterson. Lunt went
over Savage for three yards, and
went through Ramsaur for five
more. Lunt and Stanford in suc
cession failed to make more than
two yards, and Patterson punted
thirty yards to Fautz, who was
downed in his tracks. Fautz
kicked in return for thirty-two
yards to Bansbach. On a delayed
pass. Bansbach made five yards
and Lunt tore off three more over
Savage. In seven succeeding plays
the Cardinal advanced thirty-four
yards, when Berkeley took the ball

on downs on her own twenty-five
yard line.
At this juncture the tide seemed
to be turning in favor of the Blue
and Gold, for Fautz went around
Patterson for twenty-five yards.
Then Sherman went over Hall for
ten, and Berkeley went wild.
Fautz went through center for
seven yards, but fumbled, and like
a flash Bansbach was oil the ball.
Lemmon and Kennedy made it
first down in two tries, Kennedy
was good for five more, and Bans
bach annexed four on a delayed
pass. Stanford's hopes went up.
Fast and furious team work was
beginning to tell. Kennedy, Lem
mon, Frederickson, and Lunt went
over and through the Berkeley line
and landed the bail on the thirty
yard line. Two bucks over Savage
and one over Phillips netted seven
yards. Two more plays, and Lem
mon placed the pigskin within
twelve yards of the goal. Lemmon
was tried again, but was forced
back for a loss of three yards by
Hector. Bansbach made it first
down on a delayed pass, seven
yards from the line. Kennedy was
given the ball and on a magnificent
buck went over Ramsaur for a
touchdown. Patterson failed to
kick the goal. Score. 5-0.
Phillips kicked off thirty-seven
yards. Stanford tried the right
side of Berkeley's line repeatedly
for gains, rushing the ball to the
forty-five-yard line, when time was
called with the ball in Stanford's
possession.
McFadden kicked off at the be
ginning of the second half to Row
land, who was downed on the
twenty-five-yard line by Young
and McFadden. Sherman was
sent at Lunt, but Lunt forced him
back two yards. Fautz went
through center for ten yards and
was downed by Lunt. Whipple
tried Patterson's end, but Stanford
tackled him behind the line for a
loss of three yards. Berkeley here
made some fast plays, netting fif
teen yards. Lunt was injured at
this point and forced to give place
to Moore. Fautz went through
center for six and Sherman skirted
Moore for five when Frederickson
downed him. The joy of the Berke

was short-lived, for Umpire Hall
