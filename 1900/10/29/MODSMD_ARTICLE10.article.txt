An Appeal to the Student Body.
The Freshmen have earned our
respect by their magnificent exhibi
tion of the unconquerable "Stan
ford spirit." Saturday's victory,
in the face of tremendous odds, was
the result of sheer grit and determi
nation.
After such a victory we may
learn a lesson from Berkeley with
good grace. The enthusiasm of
Stanford, from the first appearance
of the red shirts to the close of the
game, proved that the spirit was
willing, but our loose, ragged yell
ing was weak. The superiority of
the support which the IJ. C. players
received from the bleachers was
painfully evident. We need not
emulate the feverish mania for
rallies which is raging across the
bay —such efforts to rekindle a
smouldering flame are as unneces
sary as they would be out of place
in our atmosphere —but it is "up
to us" to get ready for a consist
ent, effective participation in
Thanksgiving's victory.
To this end I appeal to each
member of the student body to do
two things: First, "to get in on
the interference" on the bleachers.
No yell leader on earth can main
tain his enthusiasm in the face of
indifference. Secondly (and this
applies to the girls), to learn the
words of "Rush the Ball Along,"
page 22; the prize song, "After the
Game," page 6; and"For Dear Old
Stanford," page 32. The after
noons on which the Glee Club will
be on the bleachers will be an
nounced in tomorrow's paper.
