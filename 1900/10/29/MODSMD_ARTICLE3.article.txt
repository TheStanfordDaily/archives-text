# Amendment Club Literature.
## 
### 
The Amendment Cluh has had
printed 9000 postal cards calling
attention to the proposed amend
ment and asking the support of
the voter in its behalf. These are
to be signed by the students and
addressed to voters throughout
the State. Postal cards are now
ready and can be obtained at the
Registrar's office or room 5 quad.
Students are requested to call for
them at once, as the time is rapidly
growing less. It is requested that
the students simply sign and ad
dress the cards and leave them
either at the Registrar's office or
room 5, instead of mailing them,
as the Amendment. Club wishes to
keep track of them.
