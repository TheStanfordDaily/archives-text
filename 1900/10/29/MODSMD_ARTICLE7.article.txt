Last Saturday's game and the
great victory that came with it,
while a great surprise to everybody,
shows what team work can do even
against a heavier team containing
players presumably better. The
game was a clean cut victory for
Stanford and shows indisputably
what our coach can do. Saturday's
victory is due to Coach Yost. The
fact that he was able to take eleven
raw and average players and put
them into shape so that they were
able to play with the precision and
clockwork witnessed Saturday
• peaks volumes for his ability. The
Freshmen played like veterans and
we are proud of their showing.
They played a fierce, consistent
game, one of the prettiest Fresh
man games that Stanford has ever
witnessed.
