We wish most emphatically to
second the appeal of the student
body president which appears else
where in this issue. If there is any
thing that should be drilled into
students at this time, it is the need
of an immediate and decided brace
in the way in which the team is
supported. The brunt of the strug
gle is borne by the players them
selves, and all that the rest of the
college can do is to uphold their
part on the bleachers. Berkeley
has the advantage over us in num
bers, but if every Stanford man
and woman would work from this
time on, the difference between the
support of two elevens at the
Thanksgiving game would be less
apparent this year than heretofore.
