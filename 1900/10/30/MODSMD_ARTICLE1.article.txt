# SOPHOMORES VICTORIOUS
## The 						Third Game of the Inter-class Series Goes to 1903 by a Score of 6-0. 
### 
The third of the series of class
football games between the Juniors j
and Sophomores was won by the
latter team yesterday afternoon by '
a score of (5 to 0. No score was
made in the first half, but the ball
was in the possession of the Juniors
most of the time. The Sophomores
were clearly outplayed in the first
part of the game and could make
no gains at all through the line or
around the ends. They were able
tn keep the Juniors from scoring
only by punting whenever they!
could get the ball. Boren at full-!
back for the Juniors played a star j
game, his tierce bucking nettingl
many yards for his team. No sup- j
port was given him by his team- !
mates, however, and his work was j
therefore not as effective as it oth
erwise would have been. Cowden
and Frisselle both played good in
dividual games. The second half
started very much like the first
one, with the Juniors on the offen
sive and playing a hard aggressive
game. The strain of the previous
half, however, had been too much
for them and their fierce bucks and
rushes began to lose much of their
vigor. The Sophomores rallied as
their opponents became less ag
gressive, and began to play fast
ball themselves. Parker, Luck,
and Roberts smashed through for
gains repeatedly and the pigskin
was gradually worked toward the
Juniors' goal. At last the upper
classmen got. the ball on downs
and attempted to punt out of dan
ger. Boren's kick was blocked and
a Sophomore fell on the ballon
the fifteen-yard line. A few fierce
rushes by tlie Sophomore backs
and Parker was sent over Gage for
a touchdown. Parker kicked the
goal. Score, Sophomores 6, Jun
iors 0.
