That the Stanford Amendment
is meeting with favor throughout
the State, is evident from the fav
orable reports that are being re
ceived by the Amendment Club.
The action of such influential or
ganizations as the Native Sons and
Foresters in giving their unquali
fied support and indorsement to
the proposed amendment is very
gratifying to the friends of Stan
ford. Such action cannot help but
be beneficial and bear good results.
It shows that throughout the State
interest is being taken in the
amendment, and that is what is
needed. Heretofore such proposi
tions have suffered because of the
apathy of the people at large in
regard to them. However, we can
feel assured in view of the general
interest in the amendment and the
active work carried on by the
Amendment Club that the passage
of the amendment is undoubtedly
assured. The agitation has served
to bring Stanford prominently be
fore the people of the State, and
the result cannot help but be bene
ficial to the institution.
