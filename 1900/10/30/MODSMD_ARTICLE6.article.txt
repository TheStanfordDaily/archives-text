# JUNIOR PLUG INITIATION.
## The 						Class of 1902 Formally Inaugurates the Wearing- of the Class Symbol. 
### 
Last night the Junior Class, fol
lowing the precedents established
by (he classes of 1900 and 1901,
held their Junior Plug celebration
and formally inaugurated the
wearing of the class symbol. 'l'he
ceremony took place on the foot
ball oval, and was witnessed by
over fourteen hundred people.
The rooters congregated on the
south end of the bleachers, and
made things lively during the pro
gress of the show.
The dedication this year took
the form of a skit written by F.
B. Wagner, '08, who in an entirely
new way worked out an ingenious
idea to good advantage. The Class
of 1902 was represented as the In
dian tribe of Naw Teetoo. The
skit opened with the chiefs of ihe
tribe in consultation before the
camp-fire, while the tribe is sup
posed to Lie out foraging for the
hoodoo which has followed it for
the past two years. The class yell
in the distance was the signal for
the entrance of the tribe, who
bring back the hoodoos, among
them a "pale-face." "Pale-face"
explains the hoodoos- —the "pecu
liar, pedantic pedal propellor," the
"perpendicular, polyangular pest
iferous unpopular poplar post from
the Palo Alto path," and the
"bounding bulb of brown," and in
the excitement which follows the
"pale-face" attempts but
is captured and sentenced to be
burned. He is saved, however, on
promising to discover to the tribe a
happy symbol which shall dissi
pate for all time the unlucky spirit
which has possessed the tribe, and
bring happiness and fortune for
ever after. Then with all the cere
mony peculiar to the significance
of the great event, the Junior Plug
is brought from the depths of bags
and blankets and duly initiated as
the symbol of the tribe of Naw
Teetoo.
The ceremony, taken as a whole,
was one of the most successful of its
kind ever given. The local hits
were bright and clever, and the
songs, interspersed at intervals,
were good. The ceremony, given
as it always is, at night, by the
light, of bonfires, lends itself to pic
turesque effects, and in last night's
show this was out to the
best advantage.
The following Juniors took the
principal parts: F. 11. Boren, \V.
A. Smith, F. F. Bradley, L. 11.
Boseberry, G. B. Lawrence, Frank
Karr, B. 1). Friselle, C. A. Whit
more, M. C. iMcCormick, Percy
McDowell, 11. A. Hamilton, G. G.
Gage, C. W. Hell, and C. I). Scott.
