is in jeopardy owing to the insuffi
ciency of the State Constitution un
der which the University was
founded, be it
''Resolved, That we in support
of the cause of education, and in
accordance with the principles of
our organization and in further
ance of the great work begun by
one of our pioneers, recommend the
adoption of the proposed Stanford
University constitutional amend
ment, which remedies and confirms
the endowment grants and secures
the vast endowment for the public
good forever."
