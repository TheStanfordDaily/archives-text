# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Second Team Plays Good Ball and Almost Scores on the Varsity. 
### 
Last night's football practice,
while an interesting one from the
point of view of the bleachers, was
food for serious thought 011 the part
of many who have been watching
the season's work closely. The
Varsity and second eleven lined up
against each other, and, though
the Varsity scored two touchdowns
during the practice, its work was
at times exceedingly ragged. The
great trouble was with the line
men, who could not stop Parker's
fierce bucks at all effectively. The
center trio on the second opened
up great holes in the Varsity's line
and Parker was shot through for
big gains at every trial. One of
his bucks took him clear of the
line, and, with an open field, he
sprinted towards the goal for
about thirty yards till Cooper over
took and downed him. Gregory's
work at center on the second was
largely responsible for the good
work of the backs, and it is to be
regretted that he is not eligible for
Varsity honors. Parker is also
putting up a good game and should
make a strong bucking back.
After Parker's long run he was
sent at the Varsity line repeatedly,
working the ball down to within
about a foot and a half from the
goal, when the second lost the ball.
That the second eleven should come
so near to scoring on the Varsity is
indeed strange and is indicative of
the fact that there are other foot
ball players in college than those
whose presence on the first team
during the season has created the
idea that they are the only possible
candidates for Varsity positions.
There are several men on the sec
ond whose work has been superior
to that of some of the first team
men, and, if they continue to im
prove, thev should be worthy of
some attention. Among these
might be mentioned Nourse, who
played in Varsity form in the
Alumni game, and who is easily
the fastest man on the field; and
Wardall, who puts up a smashing,
fearless game and is a hard man
to handle.
Fisher, whose shoulder was so
seriously injured in the Alumni
game, will probably not be on the
Held for some time. Geissler was
badly hurt in last night's practice
and will be out of the game for two
or three weeks. The absence of
these two men will throw a great
ileal of work on to the shoulders of
Hill and Smith. Slaker has been
doing very little heavy work of late
on account of a bad side.

The next scheduled game is with
the Reliance team next Saturday

on the campus. It will undoubt
edly be a hard fought game and
the Varsity is not in the best of
shape just at present to put up a
stiff fight.
Coach Yost is having a dummy,
which is to be used for tackling by
the players, fixed up on the foot
ball field. It will be ready for use
tomorrow afternoon.
The Freshman-Sophomore foot
ball game has been postponed to
Monday, November 12th, on ac
count of Tuesday being election
