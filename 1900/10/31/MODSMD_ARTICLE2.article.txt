imaginary journey.

and incidentally mentioning the
hydraulic mining in that neigh

Shasta and Castle Crags, running
south to Berkeley, Oakland, and
San Francisco. Then south by
ocean to Monterey, and Los Ange
les with side trips to the cities
nearby, and taking in the Yosemite
for the grandest of California
sights.
Her talk was chiefly descriptive
of the scenery, but occasionally in
terspersed by remarks on the in
dustry, history, or geography of
the regions she touched.
