# The 						New "Sequoia."
## 
### 
The first fortnightly number of
the Sequoia, out yesterday, is much
improved in general appearance
and is more than double its former
size. Good paper, wider margins,
and a light cover make it much
more attractive in appearance,
while the increased space permits
longer articles, as well as variety
of material. "The Adventures of
an Amateur Gentleman," is a
longer story than has often ap
peared heretofore; it is capitally
done and worthy of the place it oc
cupies. Miss Kalloch's ''Shall the
Chinese Go?" is decidedly bright.
"The Letter from Tien Tsin" is by
Van Norman McGee, '98, now
professor of electrical engineering
in the Imperial University.
"Dream Castle" and the sonnet
"In Absence" are something more
than college verse, and lovers of
poetry will recognize this. The
verse proper is well done, the
Rondeau, "Her Letter Came," be
ing especially light in touch.
A graduate department has been
added and the usual depart
ments have been improved. The
next number will appear next
week, and the magazine will come
out thereafter on the second and
fourth Wednesdays of the month.
