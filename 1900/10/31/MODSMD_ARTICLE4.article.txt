# ADDITIONS TO THE LIBRARY.
## The 						University Receives a Complete Set of the British State Papers. 
### 
The kindly interest of Mrs. Stan
ford in the Department of History
in Stanford University has just
given a most important addition
to its material for original research.
This consists of a set of the "Brit
ish Parliamentary Papers," popu
larly known as "Blue Books," for
the period 1805-1879 inclusive,
comprising 3,400 folio volumes.
This is believed to be the third
largest collection of these docu
ments to be brought to the United
States. Harvard has a fine set,
quite complete since about 1830,
and the University of Pennsylva
nia has secured a similar set. The
Stanford collection was procured of
Messrs. P. S. King & .Son of Lon
don, who have been engaged in
getting it together for many years.
This is the same house which pro
vided Pennsylvania and Harvard
with their sets. The teachers and
students at Stanford feel much
elated over their good fortune, for
now, with the Hausard's Debates
and the British Historical Manu
scripts collection already in the
Seminary room, it will be possible
to plan a large amount of research
work in English history. These
Parliamentary Papers are conven
iently arranged in subdivisions,
thus making their use an easy
matter, and in this respect offering
an agreeable contrast to the bewil
dering and unscientific way in
which our own government publi
cations are often printed and classi
fied. The numerous and extremely
valuable reports of special commis
sions connected with economic, sta
tistical, educational, historical, and
many other topics make this col
lection of great value to the State
of California. The divisions of the
set for each year, entitled "Bills
Public," contain all the bills of a
public nature introduced at each
session of Parliament, those not
passed as well as those enacted into
laws.
The acquirement of these docu
ments at this time has a still deeper
significance. It marks the begin
ning of an effort on the part of the
founder to build up a splendid li
brary of sets of serial publications
and collections and proceedings of
learned societies. It is reported
that already similarly important
purchases are under way in other
departments. Last year the His
tory department secured a complete
set of the German Monuments, and
Professor Howard hopes that means
will be found to secure the entire
"Rolls Series" and the "Calender
of State Papers" series, as well as
the Parliamentary Papers issued
since 1879.
