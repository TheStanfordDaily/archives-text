It seems that the Freshman De
bating Society has met with con
siderable success. A great deal Of
interest has been manifested by
many members of the class, and
the first enthusiasm at the begin
ning has by no means diminished.
The meetings have been fairly well
attended, and a few of the debat
ers have shown a good deal of abil
ity. This activity on the part of
the Freshmen is very commend
able and deserving of notice. How
ever, there ought to be more good
debaters in the Freshman Class
than have as yet appeared, and
there certainly are a few women of
the Class of 1904 who should take
an active interest in debating. The
indifference of the co-eds has been
very marked, for they seldom visit
the meetings of the society. This
deplorable lack of interest on the
part of the feminine members of
1904 is unprecedented, as our rec
ords will plainly show that the
women of the University have al
ways taken an active part in de
bating and have made as good de
baters as the men; for on several
occasions where Stanford has won,
a co-ed has been a member of the
team. There is no reason, there
fore, why the meetings of this soci
ety should not be better attended
by the women of the Freshman
Class.
