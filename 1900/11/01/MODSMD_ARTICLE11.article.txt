Tomorrow night, on the occasion
of the Carnot preliminary debate,
the chapel should he packed. Our
debaters need the entire support of
the student body. We should be
as much interested in the debating
contests as we are in other depart
ments of student activity, for a vic
tory in debating means much to
the University. If our debaters
are to realize that their efforts are
appreciated, they should be shown
that they are supported by being
greeted by a large audience. No
debater can feel like doing his best
before empty seats. Everybody
that possibly can should turn out
to the preliminaries Friday and
Saturday nights.
Since the cold weather has come
on, the windows and doors of many
of the class rooms have been closed
during the hours of recitations,
and instead of having a free circu
lation of pure air, the rooms are
hot and stuffy. When fifty or
more people sit one hour in one of
the rooms of the engineering build
ings with no fresh air except what
manages to ooze in through the
keyhole, and when these same fifty
people file out at the end of the
hour, leaving the windows still
closed, the vileness of the air is per
ceptible even in the hallways of
the buildings. In the rooms on
the quadrangle, well planned as
they are for ventilation, the air is
often heavy and oppressive. A
little co-operation among the men
and women of the University can
remedy all this, and give classes, at
the beginning of the hour at least,
a semblance of fresh air. Jf each
student, especially those in the en
gineering buildings, will do his
part, and see that on leaving a
class room at the end of the hour
the windows are all raised, and the
next class see that they stay raised,
regardless of draughts, until the
second bell rings, the condition of
affairs, in regard to the purity of
the air in the class rooms, will be
materially improved.
