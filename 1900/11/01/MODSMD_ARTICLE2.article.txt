Last night's football practice was
given over entirely to signal work.
The team was put through some
rapid formations and did some
clever team work. ICrb was tried
out at halfback and showed up
fairly well, lie is a fast man and
has a good football head. With
practice he should develop into a

strong end runner. Allen has also
shifted to the halfback position
from end, and has very good form.
He is heavy and fast and uses his
head well.
The game Saturday with Reli
ance promises to be a good one.
Reliance has played Berkeley and
Nevada since our last game with
them, and should be able to put up
a better front than ever before.
The Varsity is not in very good
shape for a hard game, but should
at least be able to score against the
club men. This is the last game
with Reliance, and will offer a good
opportunity of getting a line on the
Varsity's improvement.
The Olee Club will be on the
bleachers Wednesday and Friday
afternoons to lead the singing.
Everyone should bring song-books
on those days.
