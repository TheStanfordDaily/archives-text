# AMENDMENT CLUB'S APPEAL.
## Call Issued for Students to Work at the Polls Election Day. 
### 
To the Student Body:
The amendment campaign in
San Francisco is being carried out
along the following lines:
1. Editorials and miscellaneous
matter published in the news
papers.
2. Hand-cards containing a brief
statement of the purposes of the
amendment, distributed at the po
litical meetings of both parties, five
and six meetings being held
nightly.
3. Placards posted throughout
the city,â€” in business houses, bar
ber shops, factories, and resorts.
4. Pamphlets sent to fraternal,
social, and labor organizations;
the amendment endorsed in every
instance.
5. Shops and factories canvassed;
speeches made and literature dis
tributed.
The work is showing good re
sults. At the same time it is con
ceded that thousands of voters are
not reached by these methods, and
cannot be reached by the limited
resources of men and means at the
disposal of the alumni in this city.
Probably a majority of San Fran
cisco's seventy thousand voters will
go to the polls next Tuesday un
informed on the merits of the
Stanford University amendment.
Most of these votes can, undoubt
edly, be won at the precinct voting
places on election day if an effort
be made in that behalf.
Nine-tenths of the people to whom
the primary object of the amend
ment is explained will vote for it.
For this purpose a small hand-card
has been printed, stating the pur
poses of the amendment in three
terse paragraphs. The distribu
tion of these cards at the polls on
election day will, it is confidently
believed, give the amendment a
large vote in San Francisco and
may prove the deciding factor in
its adoption by the State.
Three to four hundred men are
necessary to carry out the plan.
The alumni of this city enlist the
co-operation of the student bod)'
in its execution, and issue this call
for a volunteer force of three hun
dred and fifty men to come to San
Francisco next Tuesday morning
and work for the amendment at
the polls.
Enlistment may be made by
leaving names with Professor Lew
ers or at the Registrar's office as
early as possible. A meeting will
be held in the chapel next Monday
night, when final directions will be
given for the work.
The railroad will make the
usual special rate.
Although this enlistment is put
upon the basis of a volunteer ser
vice on the part of the student
body, the campaign committee
hope to have sufficient funds re
maining on hand to reimburse the
individual outlay for transporta
tion.
