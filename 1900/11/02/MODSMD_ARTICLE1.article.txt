# SERIOUS ACCIDENT.
## W.A. Whitlock, '04, Has a Leg Broken at Football Practice. Tomorrow's Game. 
### 
What gave promise of being an
excellent football practice last
night was shortened by a serious
accident which befell one of the
players, W. A. Whitlock, within a
few minutes of the first line-up.
Whitlock was playing left end on
tbe second eleven and had run
down tbe field under a punt. Raitt
was running tbe ball in anddodged
Whitlock, who turned to follow
him. Nourse, who was playing
right end on tbe second, also turned
to follow Raitt, and as he did so
Whit lock's left leg in full swing
struck Nourse's shin guard. Both
men were running at full speed
and the force of the blow was such
as to break both bones of Whit
lock's leg about six inches above
the ankle. Nourse was protected
by a shin guard and was not hurt.
The injured man was taken to
his room in Encina, and his father,
who is a surgeon, was telegraphed
for. On his arrival this morning
he set the broken bone, with the
assistance of J)rs. Wilbur and
Murphy. Whitlock was removed
to his home in Berkeley this after
noon.
The injury is much regretted by
everyone, as tbe victim of the ac
cident was a popular student and
a Varsity possibility at end, where
he lias been doing excellent work.
He was not eligible to the Fresh
man team and only received his
full standing today, so that he
would have been a prominent can
didate for tbe Varsity if bis
unfortunate accident had not oc
curred. Tbe manner in which
Whitlock was hurt was a very pe
culiar one, and such as would
rarely occur under similar circum
stances.
The practice while it lasted last
night was a good one. Boren at
fullback on tbe second did some
(ierce line bucking and will make
a strong bid for sub-fullback. He
is a hard player and has the ad
vantage of the experience of an in
tercollegiate game. Practice was
called off when Whitlock was hurt.
Following is the line-up:
