Editor Daily Palo Alto :
From the showing made at the
Freshman game, it seems pain
fully evident that some plan must
be adopted at once if tbe Stanford
students are to be more than a
laughing stock at the intercollegiate
games. The time is well within
the memory of the older students
when it was an admitted statement
that one hundred Stanford men
could out-yell twice their number
of Berkeley rooters. The " Stan
ford bark" was a noted yell that
outclassed California's cadenced
slogan. But the best of the Car
dinal's friends could not make such
a claim now. Four years ago the
small contingent of Stanford men
present at Saturday's game could
have carried tRe crowd off their
feet instead of being greeted with
chilly silence, while Berkeley won
round after round of applause;
The team on the field is not en
couraged by faint or ineffective
yelling ; its spirit is dampened
rather.
The most common plaint of crit
icism among those who remember
'90 and '97 is tbe degeneration in
the manner of giving the Varsity
yell, and as this is the most impor
tant point, so it is the place where
reform should begin. The " Stan
ford bark " gained its ear-splitting
and efliective qualities from its
short, sharp, and quick divisions,
not from mere speed of utterance.
The yell as it sounds best should
clearly indicate each of the sylla
bles as it is written, " Rah-Rali-
Rah !" and at the end instead of
a mere indeterminate jumble of
sound, "Stanford" should be
clearly pronounced. Not as was
tried unsuccessfully last year, with
a long accent on the last syllable —
" Stan-ford !"; but with the em
phasis on the first syllable, and
slowly enough to make tbe last
plainly heard. As the yell is
given now, it resembles " Ra-ah,
Ra-ah, Ra-ah, Sta-an !" and any
one present at Saturday's game
will testify to the utter inadequacy
of the yell given that way. This
degeneration has been largely due
to the carelessness, not to say in
efficiency, of the yell leaders dur
ing the past three years. If we
are to make a creditable showing
at Thanksgiving, an immediate
change is necessary ; and there
should be some actual effort at
making the yell effective at the
football practice.
Another point at which we can
well improve is in the matter of
singing—not long songs of five or
six verses, but short chants with
the assistance of the band.
With the failure of the "dusty
blow, blow" yell Saturday, tbe
present tendency toward parodies
should meet its end, and the efforts
of the many capable men in tbe
University can be bent toward
something catchy and original.
