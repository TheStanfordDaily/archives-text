The appeal that appeared in last !
night's paper from the San Fran
cisco Amendment Club for students
to work at the polls on election j
day in the city should find an ear
nest response from every student.
The occasion is a momentous one,
and if by the work of the students
from here the city is carried for the
amendment, that will go far to
ward assuring the successful pas
sage of the amendment. No one
who possibly can should neglect to
go to the city next Tuesday and
putin the whole time that the;
polls are open in good hard work |
for Stanford. If three hundred and j
fifty men go up from here, there 1
can be but one result, and that is
success. Those who do volunteer
can feel that they are given an op-1
portunity that falls to few of repay
ing by actual service a small por- j
tion of the debt they owe their J
Alma Mater. The University needs j
the help of its students, and every- j
one should put aside all other du- ;
ties and respond at once.
