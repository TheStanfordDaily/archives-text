# THE
						AMENDMENT CARRIED.
## It Is Estimated That the Measure Will Pass By About 40,000 Majority. 
### 
From the few reports that have
heen received at the University as
yet, there can he no doubt that the
amendment has passed. All the
reports received have heen of the
most encouraging nature and show
that the amendment passed by
large majorities in each of the dis
tricts heard from. Whatever oppo
sition that the amendment met so
far has been slight, and without
doubt when the completed returns
are received the amendment will
have passed by a very satisfactory
majority.
The vote in the southern part of
the State is largely in favor, while
in the northern part it is close. All
of the returns have not yet heen
received, but those precincts that
have been reported indicate such
an overwhelming majority that it
is safe to predict a complete victory
for the amendment. San Fran
cisco carried by the large majority
of 10,232 and Alameda shows a
similar majority of 10,000, Los
Angeles carried by over 5,000, and
the vote in other parts of the State,
that have been heard from, show a
good majority. Thus:
Pomona and Olaremont are 715
for and 212 against.
Watsonvilie —for, 386; against,
13ft.
Redwood —for, 373; against, 31.
Belmont —for, 81; against, 5.
San Joaquin county shows a
majority of 699 with one small
precinct to hear from.
Sacramento county is 228 in
favor, with two small precincts not
yet reported. The vote in Eureka
is close.
From these results it is estimated
that the amendment will carry
by about, 40,000 majority.
The amendment with all that it
means has finally passed, and the
future prosperity of the University
is assured. The faculty, the alum
ni, and the student body have
worked and fought for the amend
ment through the campaign and,
as a result of their united efforts,
the amendment is easily carried.
This should be a cause for mutual
congratulations, as the work of
every one has been praiseworthy.
Hut the active interest that has
heen taken by the student body is
especially deserving of notice.
Their efforts to promote the inter
ests of the amendment have been
of inestimable importance, and the
manner in which they turned out
on election day to canvass voters is
highly commendable. The major
ity in San Francisco and Alameda
is largely due to their efforts.
Too much credit cannot be given
to those who have had charge of
the campaign for the amendment
and have conducted it so success
fully. The alumni in the city de
serve great praise for their untiring
efforts and the skillful way in
which San Francisco was carried
for the amendment. Professor
Lowers as vice-president of the

Amendment Club has heen un
ceasing in his efforts and
has practically directed the whole
campaign, besides making numer
ous speeches in behalfofthe measure
in the various towns in this vicin
ity. Professors Cubberley and
Duniway did much to make vot
ers acquainted with the amend
ment through the medium of the
teachers' institutes, especially in
portions of the State where the
measure was not clearly under
stood and where opposition to it
was feared.
