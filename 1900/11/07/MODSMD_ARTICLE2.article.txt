# Father Hunting-ton Speaks.
## 
### 
Father Huntington, who has
been lecturing in San Francisco
lately, delivered a short,earnest ad
dress this afternoon in the chapel.
Father Huntington is a member of
the monastic order of the Holy
Cross, an organization of six men,
members of the Episcopal Church,
who are devoting their lives to
slum work in the large cities of the
United States. The headquarters
of the order are now in Maryland,
but are to be transferred within a
a short time to New York state.
Father Huntington's address
was in the main a plea to the stu
dents to live up to the very best
that is. in them. A man, he said,
must be dominated either by good
or bad, must be tending either
towards goodness or badness.
Goodness implies a will, seeking
the moral uplift not of the man
himself, hut of the whole world.
The world is today, he said, nearer
heaven than it was yerterday, as a
result of the good deeds that have
been done during the day. These
good wills, working together, re
sult in perfect unity, goodness.
Evil wills do not work in harmony,
and the result is confusion and
strife. This good will is really,
at the very bottom of things, God
working in our inmost selves. The
speaker concluded by making a
strong appeal that men would give
their wills over to the good, not the
evil will, and so make their lives
more nearly divine.
