## Reliance Beaten 44 to 0.—Football Lists Exchanged.—Saturday's Game. 
### 
One of the largest football scores
ever made on the Stanford campus
was piled up last Saturday after
noon when the Varsity, with some
of its best men out of the play, de
feated Reliance by a score of 44 to
0. The game was an exciting one,
full of star plays and long runs.
The feature of the day, however,
and the one that called forth the
most deserved applause was Tr;ie
ger's beautiful field goals. Two
held goals in one game, and one of
these from the forty-yard line in
the last half-minute of play, is
something never before seen in Pa
cific Coast football.
The outcome of the game was a
great surprise to every one, owing
to the alleged slump in which the
Varsity has been, and a close game
with a possibility of a Reliance
score was expected. The Varsity,
however, played in excellent form,
both on the defensive and offensive,
while a portion of the score may
have been due to the ragged work
of the club men, yet our own team
work was by far the largest factor
in the result. There were eleven
men in every play, and the inter
ference was superb. Several fresh
men went into the game in the sec
ond half, and ''Babe" Burnett was
forced to retire with an injured
k nee.
The teams lined up as follows:

Next Saturday Stanford plays
its first game with the Oregon State
University. The game will be
played on the campus and a big
crowd should be on the bleachers.
The Oregon team, is an entirely
unknown quantity to Stanford
people, but under the coaching of
Kaarsberg, Berkeley's famous full
back, they have undoubtedly de
veloped a strong team. Last year
they were able to hold California
down to a 12 to 0 score, and last
Saturday were defeated by the
Multnomah Athletic Club by a
score of sto 0. Multnomah has a
strong team and last Christmas
succeeded in defeating the Stan
ford team by a score of 11 to 6.
One of the largest football scores
ever made on the Stanford campus
was piled up last Saturday after
noon when the Varsity, with some
of its best men out of the play, de
feated Reliance by a score of 44 to
0. The game was an exciting one,
full of star plays and long runs.
The feature of the day, however,
and the one that called forth the
most deserved applause was Tr;ie
ger's beautiful field goals. Two
held goals in one game, and one of
these from the forty-yard line in
the last half-minute of play, is
something never before seen in Pa
cific Coast football.
The outcome of the game was a
great surprise to every one, owing
to the alleged slump in which the
Varsity has been, and a close game
with a possibility of a Reliance
score was expected. The Varsity,
however, played in excellent form,
both on the defensive and offensive,
while a portion of the score may
have been due to the ragged work
of the club men, yet our own team
work was by far the largest factor
in the result. There were eleven
men in every play, and the inter
ference was superb. Several fresh
men went into the game in the sec
ond half, and ''Babe" Burnett was
forced to retire with an injured
k nee.
