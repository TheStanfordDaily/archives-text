# Carnot Preliminaries.
## 
### 
Out of the sixteen speakers who
competed in the preliminaries Fri
day and Saturday evenings, nix
men have been selected, who, with
English, '01, and Marrack, '01,
will take part in the final contest
for places on the Carnot team.
They are: Rice, '02, Morris, '01,
Wagner, '03, Cameron, '03, Card,
'01, and Merritt, '01. The work of
the contestants was good on the
whole, but the attendance was
woefully small. The judges were
Professors Miller, Whittier, and
li. E. Howard.
