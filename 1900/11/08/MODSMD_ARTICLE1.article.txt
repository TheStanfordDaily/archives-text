# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Varsity and Second Line Up.—Work With the Tackling Bag.—Stanford vs. Oregon. 
### 
In spite of the muddy field last
night there was a good football
practice. Some of the most prom
ising Varsity candidates were not
out, hut there was plenty of good
hard football. There was no regu
lar game, but the teams alternated
in possession of the ball, and ham
mered each other's line in turn.
Bansbach at quarter on the Var
sity and Stanford at right halfback
on the second were out for the first
time since the Freshman game,
and both played good ball. Nara
more at left half on the second also
showed up well. R. Mc Fad den,
who played so well in the Fresh
man game, is being tried out at
center on the Varsity, and is play
ing ball like a veteran. He will
probably make things interesting
for Lee in the contest for the snap
back position. Crawford is playing
a good game at quarter on the sec
ond, runs bis team with excellent
judgment, and is a hard player.
The teams lined up as follows:

The men have been given some
exercise this week with the tack
ling dummy which has been rigged
up at the east end of the field, and
general improvement in tackling
should be the result. However,
there iias been so little practice of
this nature that of course there are
as yet no noticeable effects of their
work with the dummy.
The Stanford-Oregon game next
Saturday will without doubt be
well attended. A great deal of in
terest is being taken by the student
body in this first appearance of the
northern college team on our cam
pus. That there will he a good
game of football is evident, as the
Oregon men are well trained and
have a strong team.
