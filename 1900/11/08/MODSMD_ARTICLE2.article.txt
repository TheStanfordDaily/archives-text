Editor I )aily I 'a i.o A i/ro :
The ''Stanford spirit" and the
Stanford yell are taken so seriously
now that 1 wish to correct what
seen) to me misconceptions regard
ing them. Last year the men in
the yelling section who refused to
give the yell as it was called off by
three official and two volunteer
yell-leaders were called "muckers"
to their faces. In the columns of
the Seqvnia it was stated that a
man who would not go out on to
the bleachers and give the yell was
a "mucker." It seems a generally
accepted axiom at the University
now that any student who does not
yell at the dictate of the yell
leader is deficient in "Stanford
spirit" and disloyal to his Alma

Milter. Furthermore, the iuno
cent freshmen are told that in the
"good old days" everybody yelled
all the time, and from this phenom
enon arose the "'Stanford spirit"!
Now, as I remember '94 and'9B,
we yelled then spontaneously, often
without a leader, always for some
cause. We had two yells, the
original Stanford yell and the spon
taneous Western war-whoop. If
we had yell-leaders they were on
the bleachers, saw the game, and
rtirely called for an organized yell
except when the team was about to
score or in desperate straits. Last
year the yell-leaders had their
backs to the game, one of the five
was always at work, and if men
refused to chime in on "That's the
way! Fine!!" when IJ. ,C. made
ten yards around the end they
were called hard names. All of
this strenuous endeavor was
prompted by the belief that the
team could not win unless the stu
dents yelled—as in the "good old
days."
in the old days the yelling
helped the team. Today 1 doubt
if there is- a man on the Varsity
who fully approves of organized
yelling. J have talked with many
players, old and new, and all of
them have agreed that in a Thanks
giving game they never hear the
rooters except when their shouts
drown the signals. There is one
yell which helps, and that is the
spontaneous yell of joy and encour
agement which a runner feels when
he is Hying down the field—and
another, the "Good boy, Bill,"
which should be given afterwards
to the man who runs interference
for him. This brings me to my
point, which is that it is what the
football man feels, not what he
hears, which makes him play ball.
And this may come from a tense
silence or the flutter of a white
handkerchief.
1 maintain that a man may ut
terly disregard yell-leaders and
still be a loyal Stanford student.
1 maintain that the women of the
University, though excluded from
the yelling section, may do as
much for victory as the men. If
there is a "Stanford spirit," surely
it is not held in monopoly by those
men who can make the most noise.
If there was a special virtue in the
old yell it was that the men yelled
because they wanted to — not from
a sense of duty; they yelled be
cause they were glad or undaunt
ed —not because a yell-leader
waved his cane. What we need
now, 1 think, is not more "stunts,"
more "catchy originalities," but
the old yell and a leader who
knows when to shut up. The old
yell is not "Kali, rah, rah," given
with three exhales, but "Rah, rah,
rah," given sonorous in one breath.
It was rolled out as a proud war
cry, not as a hurried yelp. It
sounded loud bccause the boys
yelled in tune; not in ragged dis
cords. And it never died out when
the team lost ground. CI had.
