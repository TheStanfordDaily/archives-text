# SPECIMENS FOR ZOOLOGY.
## A
						Valuable Collection of Minnows Has Been Received by the University. 
### 
Aii important collection of fishes
has lately been received by the
Zoology idepartment from France.
The collection consists of several
hundred specimens of minnows,
representing many different species
of that fish. They were collected
by Dr. E. Moreau in different parts
of France, including the immedi
ate vicinity of Paris, the Pyrenees
mountains, the Toulouse country,
and around the cities of Nice and
Dijon. The collection was sent to
Dr. Jordan by the Natural History
Museum of Paris. These speci
mens are especially valuable to
the Zoology department in com
paring the species from Europe
with the native fishes. Minnows
are found only in the fresh water
streams of the Northern Hem
isphere, and are plentiful only in
Europe, North America, and Japan.
They were first discovered in Eu
rope, and the different species were
described and named by the scien
tists of the old world. Now that
such a complete collection is at the
disposal of the students here, the
work of classification will be great
ly lessened. '
A comparison of the specimens
received and the native fishes
shows a strong resemblance be
tween the two. Many of the
species are the same, although
there are not as many local varie
ties as are found in Europe.
