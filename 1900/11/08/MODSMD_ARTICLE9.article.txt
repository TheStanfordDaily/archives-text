Too much praise can not be
given to the band for their earnest
efforts and splendid results this
year. They have made enough
money by playing at political
meetings to pay for their uniforms,
which are far above the standard.
Their playing at the Freshman
football game in San Francisco
cost the student body nothing, and
yet what would our yelling have
amounted to without their help?
Jt seems to us that more enthusi
asm and more spirit must have
been infused into our team by them
rendering different rousing college
tunes than all the cheering we
were able to do. The band now
contains twenty-five pieces, and
the manager intends to increase
this number to thirty, if he can
secure enough money to pay for
the additional five uniforms. If
lie does not obtain it by other
means the student body ought to
gladly supply it and any other fi
nances it may need, as it h;is done
more and cost us less than any
other band we have ever had. We
move a vote of thanks be given to
manager, leader, and members of
the band.
