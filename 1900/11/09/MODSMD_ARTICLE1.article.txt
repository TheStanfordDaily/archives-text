# FOOTBALL.
## Last Night's Practice.â€”Oregonians Arrive for Their Game Tomorrow. 
### 
Football practice last night con
sisted of the usual line-up between
the Varsity and second eleven, and
both teams played good ball.
For the Varsity, Allen played a
good game. He runs well with
the ball and gets into the interfer
ence in good shape. Hill is im
proving in his speed, and Smith
plays his usually fast offensive
game, though he might improve
his defense. Naramore, \\ ardall,
and Nourse played well for the
second. Harper, at tackle on the
second, is a good man and does
some clever work.
The teams lined up as follows:
VARSITY. SECOND.
McFadden 1 e r Nourse
Traeger 1 t r Harper
Emerson 1 g r Barnhisel
Lee c Gregory
r g 1 Thompson
Nutter r t 1 Woolley
Luck r e 1. .Wardall
Raitt q Crawford
Smith 1 h r Naramore
Allen r h 1 Knight
Hill f Parker
The University of Oregon team
arrived on the campus today at
noon, and is quartered at Encina.
They are a trifle light for a foot
ball team, but should be able to
make up in speed and team work
what they lack in weight. They
have been under the coaching of
Kaarsberg, California's famous full
back, for three months, and it is
more than likely that their game
will be a surprise to Stanford peo
ple. Their team is even better
than it was last year when they
succeeded in holding California's
team down to 12 to 0. Their de
fense is not what it was last year,
but it can advance the ball to a
much better advantage. Eleven
regular men and two substitutes
form the party which Manager L.
L. Goodrich has brought down to
play the California universities.
The line-up is as follows:
STANFORD. OREGON.
T. McFadden. .1 e r Bush
Traeger 1 t r Thurston
DeForest 1 g r Waddell
Lee ) iiT

C. N. McArthur, Varsity track
manager, accompanies the team as
assistant manager, and hopes to
arrange track meets with Califor
nia. and Stanford for next spring.
The game will be called prompt
ly at 2 o'clock.
