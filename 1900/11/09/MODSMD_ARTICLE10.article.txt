Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The writer of the editorial in
last night's issue was slightly mis
informed. The facts are that the
Executive Committee voted one
hundred and twenty-five dollars
t,o the Hand for uniforms, and the
balance necessary of about one
hundred dollars was made up by
playing at political meetings. This
is more than twice the sum ever
before given the band. As to cost
ing nothing for its playing at the
Freshman game, it might be well
to state that this was due to the
student body having obtained free
transportation for the Band from
Mr. H. ft. Judah, assistant general
passenger agent of the railroad.
Henry H. Taylor.
