### 
Orval Overall, the Berkeley
athlete, was reinstated into the
amateur ranks last evening by the
Pacific Athletic Association. The
committee who gave Overall his
amateur standing are: John Bach
nmn and 11. P. Rothkoff of the
Olympic Club and H. A. Keller of
the Reliance Club. Overall will
be a valuable addition to Berke
ley, as he is a crack baseball
pitcher, weight man, and foot
ball player.
