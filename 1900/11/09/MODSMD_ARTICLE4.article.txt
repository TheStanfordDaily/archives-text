# Trip to King's Mountain House.
## 
### 
The Christian Associations of
the University have planned their
annual trip to King's Mountain
House for tomorrow. Buses will
leave the quad at 9 o'clock. The
round trip will be 50 cents. Indi
viduals are to provide their own
lunch. A large number have al
ready sent their names in to the
committee. If, however, there
should be some who want to go,
and have failed to send their names
in, they will be provided for if they
will report to the committee at the
quad at 8:30 instead of 9.
One of the delightful features of
Stanford life is the wholesome out
door recreations possible here. All
students who have time and have
never done so should certainly go
tomorrow and get a glimpse of the
ocean from the top of the moun
tain.
