The Glee Cluh concert an
nounced in my last report was nec
essarily postponed, and has now
been definitely arranged for the
evening of Friday, November 10th,
at 7:30 in the Assembly Hall. The
proceeds will go to defray the debt
of the clubs to the student bod}',
and will if well patronized give us
needed money at the light time.
As to the rooting sections on
Thanksgiving it might be stated
that it has been arranged with Cal
ifornia to have them opposite each
other this year. They will be good
seats not far from the center of the
field, and will be individually re
served. Names of those desiring to
go in the rooting section will be
taken next Thursday, Nov. 15th,
at the postoflice, any time during
the day. Those who do not get on
the list then will have to take
other seats. The price of rooting
section seats will be $1.50 each, and
those who are on the list can get
their seats at the regular gale,
those coming first in the line get
ting their choice of seats
With the exception of one dollar
and one dollar and a half general
admissions, all seats at the game
Thanksgiving will be individually
reserved, just as seats are reserved
in theaters. This gives about
fourteen thousand reserved seats,
the prices of which will range from
$1.50 to $2 50. The sale will com
mence at the box office of the ath
letic field Monday, Nov. 19th, at
2 p.m.
The reserving of so many seats
makes it necessary to employ a
good many students as ushers.
Ushers will get their railroad ticket
and admission to the game. No
students will he employed at the
gates or in the box-offices. 1 have
appointed C. A. Cantwell to ar
range all details and make out a
list of those whom he thinks most
(it to serve. About forty men are
needed, and application should be
made to C. A. Cantwell in Encina
next Tuesday, Nov. 13th, from 1:30
to 2:30 and Bto 9:30 p.m. Only
those who have paid their student
body assessments will be placed on
the list, and those who have made
application hitherto should re
apply. In addition it is well to
state"that the management reserves
the right to reject anyone whom it
does not in its judgment deem tit
to employ. Henry H. Taylor,
Treasurer.
