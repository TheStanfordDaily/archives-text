# STANFORD VICTORIOUS.
## Oregon Defeated, by the Varsity in a Fierce Game. Score, 34-0. 
### 
Stanford's game with the Oregon
team Saturday was something in
the nature of a surprise. Of course
it was a conceded victory for Stan
ford, but that the score would be as
big as 34 to 0 was more than the
most enthusiastic had expected.
The Oregonians were altogether too
light to withstand the tierce rushes
of the Cardinal, arid though they
put up a game fight, they could not
effectively smash, the Stanford in
terference. Their defensive game
was a good one, all things consid
ered.
Captain Zeigler at left end was
easily the star of the team. His
tackling was of a high order, and
though a light man he seldom
failed to bring down the runner
when his end was tried. Smith at
left half was the only effective
ground gainer that the Oregonians
could produce. The condition of
the visitors was undoubtedly su
perior to that of our own team, as
they were not injured as often and
took out less time than our own
men did.
For Stanford, Erb and Smith did
the most effective work in advanc
ing the ball. Smith made several
long runs, two of them being for
forty and thirty-five yards respec
tively. Erb's seventy-five yard
sprint past the entire Oregon team
for a touchdown, was, however, one
of the most brilliant runs ever seen
on a California gridiron. He went
through the line with good inter
ference, and with the aid of a well
directed straight-arm was able to
evade the scattered tacklers who
attempted to stop him. Hill
played a consistent bucking game
and could always be depended on
for bis distance. McFadden and
Cooper played good ends, McFad
den getting down the field and
tackling in his old-time form. Lee
was a surprise to everyone who has
been watching him this season.
The way he played his position
shows that he can be aggressive
and get into the play when he tries.
Raitt played an excellent game
and ran bis team with masterly
skill. Traeger tried a place kick
twice, but failed both times by nar
row margins. Referee Dave Brown,
however, admitted after the game
that one of them should have been
allowed, as it failed merely on a
technicality.
The Varsity men almost without
exception say that Oregon is the
strongest that they have played
against this season. Their lack of
weight was of course a serious han
dicap, but they had some of the
fine points of the game mastered in
a way that was surprising. This
is notably true of their tackling.
In another year Oregon should be
able to put out a much better team,
as her experience this year with
three varsities will do much for her
in the future.

The University of California de
feated the Reliance Athletic Club
team in San Francisco Saturday
l»y a score ol<l r*-0: The score was
made by a touchdown and a field
goal from the thirty-five-yard line
made by Buarter-back More. More
was the star of the day, as it was
he who dropped on the ball after
it had rolled across the goal line
on a fumble by Smith. Cali
fornia's play was ragged both on
defense and offense. Reliance
tackled the Blue and Gold backs
behind the line repeatedly and
played a strong game in every way,
a few minutes of the game being
played with only ten men in the
Athletic Club team.
California and Nevada play on
the California campus Wednesday
afternoon. A number of the Var
sity men will go over to watch the
game. Nevada will probably meet
Oregon on the Berkeley gridiron
Thursday, and will play here next
Saturday.
