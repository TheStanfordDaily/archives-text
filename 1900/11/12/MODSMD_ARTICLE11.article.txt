In another column of this issue
is presented a reply to the commu
nication by "Grad," published last
week. It is interesting to note the
entire difference between the two.
Today's communication presents
an entirely new view of organized
yelling, and one that has grown up
in the last few years. Every one
knows that in the earlier games
there was no attempt at yelling as
it is conducted today, except as the
occasion required. However, we
believe that "Grad" is right in his
contention that this plan of yelling
in unison all the time during the
game, and threatening every stu
dent with the risk of being called
"mucker" and other endearing ti
tles if he did not get in on the yell,
is without doubt a very poor policy.
If San Francisco expects the rival
aggregations of "rooters" to furnish
amusement, let it be given before
the game. That is the only time.
Just before the teams appear and
have lined up, or between the halves
of the game, then the "rooters" can
show their lung capacity and exer
cise their ingenuity in giving forth
fancy stunts. During the game
itself there is, it should seem, but
very little chance for organized
yelling. Yelling during the play
is and at best should be purely I
spontaneous, and all the efforts of
yell leaders to create enthusiasm or
help the team to win are of no
avail unless they possess that qual
ity.
