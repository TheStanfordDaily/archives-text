Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I see by last Thursday's Daily
I'alo Alto that our friend "The
Grad" is back again. We have
been amused by his talking ever
since we lost the game in '98, when
he began a reform movement of
taking affairs out of our hands and
placing them in his own. But we
wouldn't stand for that, and now,
at last, "Grad" comes out in print
to give counsel to us who know
nothing about any thing. This par
ticular "Grad" is a product of the
days of '94. Now, we all honor the
pioneers, but undergraduates in
sist upon one fact, that things have
been happening since '94. For the
benefit of "Grad" we will mention
just one of them.
He objects to being called a
"mucker" when he doesn't yell;
says that in his day there was no
organized yelling; that men yelled
as they pleased, and that he in
tends to yell as he pleases.
Well, since his day there has
been a marked evolution in college
yelling. Whether we like it or not,
and most of us like it, the San
Francisco public has come to re
gard the rooters as giving a show
on Thanksgiving day, before the
line-up. Berkeley is always ready
with her "stunts.'' it's a case of
playing to the gallery, and unless
we want to be laughed at we must
have a few "stunts" of our own up
our sleeve. We must do the spec
tacular, and unless "Grad" gets in
the interference we will be under
the painful necessity of branding
him with all others who fail to
"leave their womenkind behind,"
as a "mucker."
We know, as well as "Grad,"
that the team doesn't need organ
ized yelling, any more than they
need a uniformed band.
If "Grad" would quit telling the
yell leader to "shut up"; if he
would crawl into the rooting sec
tion and modestly do what he is
told, even if it be but "the flutter
ing of a white handkerchief," he
would earn the esteem and respect
of many an Undekgrad.
