# Thanksgiving Bleachers.
## 
### 
Treasurer Taylor is in San Fran
cisco making arrangements for the
construction of the bleachers at
Folsom street grounds for the
Thanksgiving game. The seating
capacity will be 8,000. The slope
of the bleachers will not be as great
as last year, and they will lie con
structed to allow room for the spec
tator's feet, thus enabling one to
watch the game without the usual
bodily discomfort. There will be
individual seats and each one will
be numbered so that the bleachers
may be reserved to the purchasers
of tickets.
