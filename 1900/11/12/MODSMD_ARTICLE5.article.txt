## "Life, a Gift from Above," the Subject of Sunday Morning's Sermon. 
### 
The regular Sunday sermon was|
preached ly the llev. George C. \
Adams of the First Congregational
Church of San Francisco. His
subject, taken from John X, 10, "J
am come that they might have life
and that they might have it more
abundantly," was entitled ' Life, a
Gift from Above." He said:
"The fishermen,. tax gatherers,
and sinners, whom Jesus gathered
about him, by their confessions,
turned the world upside down.
We are h.ertv today because of it.
Jesus gave the truths he had to
convey in 'such a wise manner
that when his face was gone forever
from their midst his disciples were
giants. Giants to carry out his
will After they had lost their
leader, they were persecuted, every
indignity was heaped upon them;
at night they were putin prison,
in the morning they were released,
and at noon they were preaching
again.
"Take His statement. First,
'1 come.' Jesus is not coming to
earth again and again. He is not
continually coming. It has been
proved that he stood by' Gallilee
and that he influenced men. The
question is not, whether or not he
came, but just what his relation to
the Father was. No one doubts
the historical fact of Christ's com
ing. There was never a time in
the history of the world when the
name of Jesus commanded so much
respect as now. Crowds of work
iiigmen will cheer at the mention
of his name. Why then repeat it
'Jesus came'? Men do not get
down to the beginnings of things.
Workingmen cheer at the name of
Jesus because he was a carpenter.
If anyone hud preached unselfish
ness to them, the same men would
have hissed. Men need to know
Jesus as one who came to save
them 112 ruin t heir si us.
'If you study the New Testa
ment carefully you will say Jesus
Christ died a voluntary death.
He could have saved himself at
any time. The older we grow the
less we believe that the majority
are always right, and the older we
grow the less we believe that Na
poleon was i when he said that
God is on the side of the strongest
battalion. It depends on your
definition of strongest. There are
unseen forces enough at work.
Jesus Christ might have escaped.
He would not. 'If it be possible,
let this cup pass from me; but nev
ertheless, your will, not mine, be
done.'
"History shows that every race
which has come to the front has
started with some moral influence
and has gone forward just so far as
it has followed this moral impulse.
No nation ever died but by suicide.
"The world needs something
more than science, than wise meth
ods; something more even than
morality. It needs inspiration.
"The impulse from without
makes a nation what it is. Civili
zation is brought forward by im
pulses from without. But when it
I comes to anything else a spiritual

impulse in needed. The strength
of the Anglo-Saxon nice is the
strength of its Christianity. Car
lyle says there are three typical
names in England's literature.
They are Knox, M illun, and Sliak
spere. All England yet rings with
John Knox's sermons. Milton is
the grand independent of those
days. Shakspere is saturated with
the Bible. These men are types of
those who made the literature we
call English.
"A literature that has Christ he
hind it has immortal power. There
is no possibility of achieving what
we hope for, with Christ left out.
Some one has said, in reading Mus
ic in, take a pencil and underscore
all that is based on the Hi hie. As
a result nearly every page will be
underscored. That is the type of
our English literature.
''Abundance! All the abundance
of our life is from Him. The civil
ization of today, with all its faults,
with all its virtues, is as good as it
is because tif Jesus Christ of Naz
areth."
