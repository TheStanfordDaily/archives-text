# FOOTBALL AFFAIRS.
## Injured Men Recovering.â€”Rooting Section Arrangements Made. 
### 
Football practice last niglit was
given over entirely to signal work
aiill punting, there being no regu
lar line-up. Burnett's injury to
his knee is about well, and Smith,
who was hurt in the Oregon game,
will not be out of the practice at
all. Traeger received a severe
muscle bruise in the Oregon game
as a result of a hard tackle by
Captain Zeigler, and is walking
with a cane for a few days.
Geisslor's shoulder is again in good
shape and he will be in the prac
tice from now on. Fisher's
shoulder is doing very well, but it
will undoubtedly keep him out of
the game for the season. Slaker's
broken rib is improving and he
may be expected to be in shape in
a few days. The other men are all
in good shape.
Arrangements have been perfect
ed in regard to the rooting sections
at the game, Stanford securing the
position which the Berkeley section
iiad last year, and which is the
most desirable location on the
grounds. Berkeley will probably
occupy the seats which last year
formed the Cardinal section.
According to the plan outlined
by Treasurer Taylor, names of
those desiring seats in the rooting
section will be taken Thursday,
November 15th, at the postoffice on
the campus all day. As usual,
seats will be sold only to male
Stanford students, ex-students, and
alumni. Those desiring to sit to
gether can give in names through
one man, and they will then be
grouped by the person taking the
names. Any group of tickets can
then be obtained by any one per
son on the following Monday at 2
p.m. at the regular sale, which will
take place at the box office on the
athletic field. The best rooting
seetion seats will be given to those
groups whose representatives are
first in line at the sale. When any
one person gets seats for a whole
group, he will of course have to
give the names of those for whom
he is getting the tickets, so that the
names can be checked off on the
list to be made Thursday, thus pre
venting any person from getting
more than one ticket.
Next Saturday's game with the
University of Nevada is the Varsi
ty's last game before Thanksgiving,
and will undoubtedly be an inter
esting one. The Nevada team
plays Berkeley tomorrow and Ore
gon Thursday. So this game with
Stanford will be a good opportu
nity to compare our own team with
that of California.
