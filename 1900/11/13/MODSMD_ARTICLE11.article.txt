The bleachers have vented a
dissentient voice lately at several
football games with regard to the
keeping of certain players in the
game who appeared to them to he
Unfit to play because of physical
injuries. During the game with
Oregon and also in the last game
with Reliance such requests were
noisily uttered. This action on
the part of the bleachers, it seems,
is wholly unjustifiable and un
called for, and should be con
demned as mere sentiment. There
are a coach, a trainer, and a j
football captain on the field, who |
look after the interest and welfare
of every individual man, and are
vastly better able to judge of his
physical condition than people who
sit in the yelling sections. Surely
these men, whose every thought
and act are directed towards the
betterment of the team, will run no
unnecessary risk. It is well to
note that these sentiments were
voiced by a large minority and
that the consensus of opinion was
opposed to the action. It is hoped
that in the future the bleachers
will be more careful not to trespass
beyond their active sphere, which
is one of encouragement and not
one of dictation.
