# Back from Alaska.

### 
\V. H. Osgood, '99, and Edmund
Heller, '01, who lmve been absent
on an Alaskan trip in behalf of the
United States Biological Survey,
have just returned to the Univer
sity, Heller to continue his studies
and Osgood to proceed to Washing
ton to take up his work at the
Smithsonian Institute after a few
days stay in this vicinity.
The two men left Seattle on May
20th, stopping at Fort K u pert.

Vancouver Island, for two weeks
and then spending a month ex
ploring several islands in the
Queen Charlotte group. As this
locality was abounding in animal
life and had hitherto been an un
known quantity to naturalists, it
is highly probable that the reports
from Washington, whither the
specimens have been sent, will re
veal several interesting and valua
ble discoveries. In every case the
places visited were thoroughly ex
plored clear up to the snow-line,
which in the Queen Charlottes had
an altitude of 4,000 feet.
The party proceeded steadily
northward, hugging the shore close
ly, and stopping off at various
points. At Fort -Uranzell a stay
of a week was made. The vicinity
is inhabited by Indians, who fish
along the shore and are ignorant
of the interior. The land was
heavily timbered, and the scient
ists had great difficulty in beating
iheir way up to the snow-line, with
a compass their only preventative
against getting lost in the under
brush. In Cook's Inlet, where the
tides rise almost as high as in the
Bay of Fundy, the vegetation is
more sparse, and the snow-line
very low. A black bear and a
moose was the Inlet's contribution
to the collection of mammals, and
after leaving there the expedition
threaded the innumerable islands
which fringe the Alaskan Coast,
until their farthest point, Unalaska
of the Aleutian Islands, was
reached.
On October 27th the run for
home commenced, Seattle being
reached November 2d. In all,
about one thousand specimens of
mammals and plants were obtained
and shipped to Washington, mak
ing this one of the most successful
trips that Stanford men have as
yet been engaged in.
