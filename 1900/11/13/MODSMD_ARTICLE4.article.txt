### 
L. M. Hoskins, professor of Ap
plied Mathematics in the Univer
sity, has recently published a text
hook on Theoretical Mechanics.
The book contains the fundamental
principles of mechanics, enforced
by a number of illustrations and
numerical examples. As to its
scope, the book has been designed
to meet the needs of students of
engineering in American univer
sities and technical colleges. It is
divided into three parts, which em
brace respectively Statics, Motion
of a Particle, and Motions of Sys
tems of Particles and of Rigid
bodies. Professor lloskin's book,
which was published at the Uni
versity, is not only a valuable text
book in connection with his course
in Theoretical Mechanics, but is a
considerable addition to the field
of engineering and applied mathe
matics.
