# AMENDMENT RALLY.
## The 						Passage of the Stanford Measure Fittingly Celebrated Last Night. 
### 
Last night the successful passage
of the Stanford Amendment was
celebrated in a manner correspond
ing to the nature of the event. The
rally held last night was one of
the largest and most successful
ever held on the campus, in fact
the largest seen here since the fa
mous outburst when the future of
the University was made possible
by the winning of the suit.
Last night's affair was carefully
worked up and carried out with
great enthusiasm. Nearly every
student was present, besides many
visitors from the near-by towns.
The rally opened by the prelimi
nary gathering and "jolly-up" in
Encina club-room, where the en
thusiastic rooters gathered and,
headed by the band, marched out
to the football field. Here an im
mense bonfire of empty barrels had
been constructed, and as the pro
cession marched around the cinder
track the effect as witnessed by the
large crowd on the bleachers was
very pleasing.
The rally proper was opened by
President Alarrack, who called the
crowd to oider and, acting as mas
ter of ceremonies, introduced the
speakers of the evening.
Professor C. R. Lewers was the
first speaker. He spoke in high
praise of the loyal efforts of faculty,
alumni, and .students of the Uni
versity in behalf of the amend
ment.
George E. Crothers, '95, of San
Francisco, president of the Amend
ment Club, was the next speaker.
He told of the early planning and
work done by friends of the Uni
versity in order to have the amend
ment passed through the legisla
ture. He paid a high tribute to
the many friends and organizations
whose unselfish efforts were respon
sible for the success of the measure.
John F. Sheehan, '95, told of
many amusing experiences which
he and J. S. Briscoe, ex'OO, encoun
tered while working for the amend
ment on the water front and south
of Market districts in San Fran
cisco.
The last speaker of the evening
was Professor Burt Estes Howard,
who spoke of the deep feeling of
patriotism and pride that the grad
uate feels for his alma mater. He
called upon the students to make
the most of the brilliant opportu
nity afforded them. His speech
was very enthusiastically received.
Dr. Jordan was to have been the
principal speaker of the evening,
but owing to a previous engage
ment in San Francisco was unable
to be present.
