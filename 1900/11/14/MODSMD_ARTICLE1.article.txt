# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Varsity and Second Have Spirited Contest.—Last Preliminary Game. 
### 
Practice last night was a brisk
and hard one, and though several
of the most promising Varsity men
were not in the game, the second
was unable to hold the first team
down more than a few times. Some
Sood playing was done on both
teams. Allen on the Varsity made
a beautiful run around the end, hut
got ahead of his interference, and
in slowing up to get behind it, was
downed. Erb also made some
good runs and bucks. He is
showing up very well for a
light man, his speed and head
work standing him in good stead.
His defensive work is also of a high
order. Traeger, Smith, and l)e
Forest were unable to line 11 p on
account of their injuries. Hill and
Cooper were both injured in last
night's practice, and Slaker and
Luck were putin their places.
McFadden was tried at center on
the Varsity and played good ball.
Lee is developing more fighting
spirit and made a good showing
last night at left guard.
On the second, Boren and Parker
did some good bucking and de
fensive work. Barnhisel plays a
steady, consistent game and gets
into the play in earnest. Follow
ing is last night's line-up:

The Varsity squad went to Ber
keley today to witness the Cali
fornia-Nevada game on the Berke
ley . gridiron.
The last preliminary game of
the season, next Saturday, between
Stanford and Nevada promises to
be a most interesting one. Not
only is it the last game, but Berke
ley having played them three days
before, we will be given an excel
lent opportunity to size up our
Thanksgiving prospects. The
Band will be out and the affair will
be made into the nature of a rally.
Lveryone who can possibly attend
the game should do so and encour
