Editor Daily Palo Alto :
Dear Sir: —Permit me to correct
n statement in last evening's issue.]
No doubt misled by an item which
appeared in certain San Francisco
papers, the Daily Palo Alto stat-,
ed that 1 have accepted a call to!
the pastorate of the Unitarian
Church in San Jose. This is an i
error. The Unitarian Church in
San Jose is at present without aj
stated minister. On invitation, I
have consented to speak in the pul
pit of that church on Sunday even-j
ings until a settled minister may,
be secured. No formal relationship!
has been established between the
church and myself, nor will be.
My work is in the University first
and last, not in the pulpit.
Yours most truly, 112
Burt Estes Howard.
