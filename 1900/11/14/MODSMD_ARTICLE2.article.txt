# "Stunts in a Studio."
## 
### 
The first rehearsal by the Glee
Club of "A Twenty-Minute HJx
posure," or "Stunts in a Studio"in
dicates that the tailpiece of next
Friday's concert will lift a success.
The farce will conclude the even
ing's program. The idea is a
novel one and very simple.
The Berkeley (Jlee Club arrive
at a photographer's studio to have
their annual picture taken. At
the request of the photographer's
fascinating lady-assistant, they

sing and play. As she is a loyal
Stanfordite, they attempt to per
suade her to go to Berkeley, but in
vain.
After half a dozen futile at
tempts to secure a proper pose, the
photographer finally takes the
picture by flashlight, with a re
markable result.
The chief novelty of the farce is
in a couple of "Broken Verses,"
called a "Syllabic Syncopation,"
which are recited by the entire
"Berkeley" Glee Club, but not in
chorus.
Further details have not yet
been furnished. The cast of char
acters will be given in tomorrow's
Daily Palo Alto.
Seats for the concert will be on
sale tomorrow at Palace Phar
macy in Palo Alto and University
Drugstore on the campus. Price
for reserved seats, 50 and 25 cents.
