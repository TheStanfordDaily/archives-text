# DR. EDWARD A. ROSS RESIGNS.
## The 						Head of the Department of Economics Loaves the University at the Demand of Mrs. Stanford. 
### 
Dr. Ed wit rd A. Ross, head of the
Department of Economics and So
ciology, and one of the most able
men in the faculty, has tendered
his resignation, which was accepted
yesterday by Dr. Jordan. The an
nouncement in the morning papers
came as a great surprise to the stu
dents, for Dr. lloss has always been
very popular and his worth as a
scientist and a teacher has been
recognized everywhere. He is
without itn equal in his line of so
cial science and theoretical sociol
ogy.
Dr. Ross's resignation comes as
the result of statements which he
has made at various times, which
have brought upon him the con
demnation of powerful influences
in San Francisco. These influences
were brought to bear upon Mrs.
Stanford, and she insisted that he
sever bis connection with the Uni
versity.
Dr. Ross made a statement in
which he told of the events leading
up to his resignation yesterday. A
resume of the statement is as fol
lows: Dr. Ross delivered an ad
dress last May in San Francisco,
in which be tried to show that ow
ing to its high birth-rate the Orient
is the land of ''cheap men," and
that the coolie, though he cannot
outdo the American, can underlive
him. lie argued that the high
standard of living in America will
be imperiled if Orientals are al
lowed in this country before they
have raised their standard of liv
ing, and that as the Pacific is the
natural frontier of the East 'and
West, California might easily ex
perience the same famines as India
and China if it had the same kind
of men. This scientific coordinat
ing of the birth-rate with the inten
sity of the struggle for existence
was a new note in discussion of
Oriental immigration, and made a
great impression. Dr. Jordan
heard from .Mrs. Stanford just after
this address, and she announced
herself as greatly displeased with
Dr. Ross, and refused to reappoint
him. Through the earnest efforts
of Dr. Jordan, however, Mrs. Stan
ford was prevailed upon to give her
consent to retaining Dr. Ross at
the head of his department, and he
was reappointed June 2d for the
year 1900-01. The outlook was
such, however, that he presented
his resignation to Dr. Jordan, but
this was not acted upon at once, as
both Dr. Jordan and S. F. Leib,
president <>112 the Board of Trustees,
were doing everything in their
power to prevail upon Mrs. Stan
ford to alter her decision. This
proved unavailing, and on Novem
ber 12th, Dr. Jordan accepted the
resignation. In accepting the res
ignation, Dr. Jordan said that he
had hoped circumstances would
arise which would lead Dr. Ross to
a reconsideration, but as such was
not the case, lie accepted the resig
nation with great reluctance.
In April last year Dr. Ross lec
tured in Oakland on "The Twenti
eth Century City" and dealt with
questions of city government and

city health. The address was gen
eral in character and took no stand
on local questions, but the lecture
was objected to. On two other oc
casions objections were made to his
utterances. Concluding bis state
ment Dr. Ross said*
"It is plain, therefore, that this
is no place for me. I cannot with
self-respect decline to speak on top
ics to which I have given years of
investigation. It is my duty as an
economist to impart, on occasion,
to sober people, and in a scientific
spirit, my conclusions on subjects
with which I am expert, and if I
speak I cannot but take positions
which are justified by statistics of
the Old World, such as the muni
cipal ownership of water works or
the monopoly profits of street car
companies; or by standard eco
nomic science, such as the relation
of the standard of life to the density
of population.
"1 have long been aware that my
every appearance in public drew
upon me the hostile attention of
certain powerful persons and in
terests in San Francisco, and they
redoubled their efforts to be rid of
me. Bui L had no choice but to go
straight ahead. The scientist's bus
iness is to know some things clear
to the bottom, and if he hides what
he knows he loses his virtue.
"I am sorry to go, for I have put
too much of my life into this Uni
versity not to love it. My chief re
gret in leaving is that 1 must break
the ties that bind me to my col
leagues of seven years and must
part from my great chief, Dr.
Jordan."
Dr. Ross has no plans as to his
future work. He will not leave the
University until the end of this
semester.

In April last year Dr. Ross lec
tured in Oakland on "The Twenti
eth Century City" and dealt with
questions of city government and

city health. The address was gen
eral in character and took no stand
on local questions, but the lecture
was objected to. On two other oc
casions objections were made to his
utterances. Concluding bis state
ment Dr. Ross said*
"It is plain, therefore, that this
is no place for me. I cannot with
self-respect decline to speak on top
ics to which I have given years of
investigation. It is my duty as an
economist to impart, on occasion,
to sober people, and in a scientific
spirit, my conclusions on subjects
with which I am expert, and if I
speak I cannot but take positions
which are justified by statistics of
the Old World, such as the muni
cipal ownership of water works or
the monopoly profits of street car
companies; or by standard eco
nomic science, such as the relation
of the standard of life to the density
of population.
"1 have long been aware that my
every appearance in public drew
upon me the hostile attention of
certain powerful persons and in
terests in San Francisco, and they
redoubled their efforts to be rid of
me. Bui L had no choice but to go
straight ahead. The scientist's bus
iness is to know some things clear
to the bottom, and if he hides what
he knows he loses his virtue.
"I am sorry to go, for I have put
too much of my life into this Uni
versity not to love it. My chief re
gret in leaving is that 1 must break
the ties that bind me to my col
leagues of seven years and must
part from my great chief, Dr.
Jordan."
Dr. Ross has no plans as to his
future work. He will not leave the
University until the end of this
semester.
