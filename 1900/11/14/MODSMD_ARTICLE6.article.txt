# Last Night's Lecture.
## 
### 
Those who heard Dr. Jordan at
the Assembly Hall last night came
away feeling that they knew some
thing about Japan and had in a
measure really seen the country.
While he did not call his talk a
lecture, his explanations to the pic
tures were frought with such in
formation and humor as ieft his
audience in a state of keen enjoy
ment and intense realization of
conditions existing in the islands
across the Pacific.
Dr. Jordan did not make any
introductory remarks but simply
showed the series of pictures and
made a running fire of comment
and explanation on each of them.
The views shown comprise a
complete gallery of Japanese
scenery, the people, and their
manner of living. These views
were the property of George
Kinzie of San Francisco, through
whose courtesy the University en
joyed the finest group of pictures
ever exhibited here.
