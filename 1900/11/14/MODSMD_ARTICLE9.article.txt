Announcement is made today of i
a series of prizes offered by the edi-1
torial board of the 1902 Annual for j
the most meritorious poems and ;
short stories submitted to it in
competition. This prize competi-j
tion has been a regular feature of
the Quad for years, and to capture
the prize poem or prize story in the
Annual is to be regarded as quite
an undergraduate honor. There
should be a much larger number of
students than usual to try for these
prizes. Heretofore the great trou
ble has been that the competition
has been limited to a very few,
who are regular contributors and
members of the staff of the college
publications. There should be
more students who are willing to
try for these prizes, as their aim,
aside from securing first-class con
tributors, is to endeavor to interest
those members of the student body
who have ability but, through lack
of time or other causes, do not care
to try unless the object is sufficient.
Complaint has been frequently
made, and perhaps justly, that the
amounts offered in all the prize
contests are not sufficient to en
courage a student to spend time in
trying for them. This may be so,
but there can be no doubt that in
most cases the amounts offered do
not represent value enough, but
they represent all that those offer
ing the prize can afford to pay. It
is hardly a question of value re
reived, but of helping the college to
make the best showing.
