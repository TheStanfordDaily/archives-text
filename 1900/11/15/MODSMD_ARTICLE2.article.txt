# Football Affairs.

### 
The Varsity squad went to
Berkeley yesterday to witness the
game between California and Ne
vada, and in consequence there
was no football practice last night.
The game at Berkeley was a most
one-sided affair, Berkeley winning
easily by a score of 32 to 0. The
Nevada team played a plucky up
hill game and contested every inch
of territory. A comparison of the
gains and the number of plays

made will show the inequality of
the two teams. California executed
108 plays, netting in all 708 yards,
while Nevada was able to make
but 80 yards in '62 plays. Nevada
had the advantage in kicking,
Moore being out of the game. Ne
vada plays Oregon this afternoon
on the Berkeley gridiron, and Sat
urday meets our Varsity here. The
Berkeley line-up was practically
what it will be in the Thanksgiv
ing game.
The game with Nevada will be
the last preliminary game and
every Stanford student should be
on the bleachers to encourage the
team in its last game. What our
team can do against the Nevada
men will be a strong indication of
what we may expect of them
Thanksgiving.
The sale of seats for the game
will take place next Monday at 2
p.m. at the box office of the foot
ball field. The rooting section
seats, for which names were taken
today, will be on sale at this time,
as will all the other Stanford seats.
