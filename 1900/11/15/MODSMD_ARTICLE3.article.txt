# The 						San Jose Scale in Japan.
## 
### 
Mr. Kuwana, assistant ii! Ento
mology, has written a preliminary
report of his summer's work in
Japan on the scale-insects. This
is the iirst systematic investigation
of the Japanese scales, and is im
portant not only to Japan but to
this country because of the con
stant importation, on cuttings and
nursery stock,[of these distinctive
insect pests. Mr. Kuwana ex
plored all of the islands composing
the Japanese empire, and brought
back with him thousands of speci
mens. His special attention was
given to the notorious San Jose
scale now recognized as the most
dangerous fruit pest in thecountry.
It has long been suspected that
(his pest is a native of Japan. If
ho, it is reasonable to expect to
find also in Japan its special pre
daceous and parasitic enemies. If
these enemies can be found and es
tablished in this country, the most
important step in fighting the
pest here will have been taken.
Mr. Kuwana found the San Jose
scale on all the main islands of
Japan, excepting one, attacking
pear, plum, apple, peach, quince,
and other trees. With the excep
tion of a few places the scale is no
where so abundant as to endanger
the orchards. In many places this
immunity is due to the scale's in
sect enemies, of which Mr. Ku
wana found four species, one
a chalcid parasite and three
predaceous lady-bird beetles. The
scale has been known in Japan
under the name Ki-Abura for more
than thirty years. It occurs in
many orchards of native trees, at
considerable distances from any im
ported trees Altogether the evidence
collected by Mr. Kuwana points
strongly to the probability that
the scale is a native of Japan, being
imported to this country without
its parasites and finding here a cli
matic and general environment
very favorable to its successful life.
Although first recognized in
this country as a pest in Califor
nia, it now does much greater in
jury in the Eastern States than on
the Pacific Coast.
