The concert to be given tomor
row evening by the Glee and Man
dolin Clubs of the University
should have a large attendance.
This is their first appearance this
year, and they have been practic
ing faithfully for it since the first
of the semester. The girls' musical
clubs will take part in the program
and it is not often that the students
have an opportunity of hearing
them on our campus. The farce is
said to be very comical, and every
one that attends may expect a
first-class time. The clubs are now
considerably in debt to the student
body, and the proceeds will go
toward paying it off. If the enter
tainment is well attended, much
needed funds will be supplied to
the treasurer. It must be remem
bered that this year started with a
large debt against the student
body, and this has crippled us in a
number of ways during the present
football season. We are in need of
more football suits, but are unable
to purchase them. If the debt
against the musical clubs is cleared
away, it will be a step in the right
direction toward getting the stu
dent body out of debt, and putting
us once more on a solid financial
basis.
