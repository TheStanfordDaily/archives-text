# STANFORD NIGHT.
## Columbia Theatre Is Secured for a Show on Thanksgiving Night. 
### 
A telegram was received this
afternoon from Treasurer Taylor
announcing that he has been suc
cessful in securing the Columbia
Theatre in San Francisco on
Thanksgiving night.
This is the result of long negoti
ations of Stanford students with the
San Francisco theatrical managers.
An attempt was made to secure the
Tivoli earlier in the season, but the
University of California had al
ready secured that theatre for their
show. Some effort was made here
by Sword and Sandals to secure
one of the smaller theatres and put
on a strictly. Stanford show with
the entire performance given by
the students, hut this fell through
also on account of the large amount
of time necessary to prepare a good
performance.
The show to be given on Thanks-*
giving night will be Alice Nielsen's
company in the comic opera, "The
Singing Girl," which opens at the
Columbia November 26th. This
company is one of the best comic
operas now on the road and in
cludes some of the best players in
the country. So the show will be
the best in the cil}' on that night.
The stage will be decorated for the
occasion, and as is customary Stan
ford "stunts" will be introduced
into the play, so that it will be
strictly a Stanford night at the
Columbia on that evening.
The students have received the
whole of the house for the perform
ance. Seats will be sold down here
next Thursday. No doubt a sec
tion will be reserved for the rooters
at the show, so that they can he
together and ''jolly up." Prices
have been fixed at one dollar and
one dollar and a half. According
to the tine performance that is
guaranteed the sale of seats here lit
Stanford should he very large.
