Tomorrow's game, provided the
weather is favorable, should prove
a very interesting exhibition, and
as it is the last Varsity game be
fore Thanksgiving should be well
attended, as it will be the last good
opportunity to turn out in force

from the results of the gome last
Wednesday between California and
Nevada, which resulted in a 82-0
score, the game should be even an
easier one than that with Oregon
last Saturday. Still, for all that,
Nevada has several players who
are exceptionally good, and the
whole team puts up a gritty fight
ing game, one that is welS worth
seeing.
