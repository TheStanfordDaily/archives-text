Judging from the advance orders
already received at the Bookstore,
the sale of "rooters'" caps will not
be very large, and consequently
there will be very few worn at the
game. If the caps are to be adopt
ed and worn as the official insignia
of the Stanford "rooters," they
should be generally worn if they
are to produce the desired effect.
In order to make the best showing
they should be worn by every one
in the rooting section, so that from
the bleachers the section will pre
sent a solid block of cardinal.
However, this year the section seats
will be individually and there will
be no chance to group together
those wearing caps. If the caps
are not going to be a success, either
let us abandon the idea altogether
or attempt to adopt something that
will not only be distinctive of Stan
ford but generally worn as well.
