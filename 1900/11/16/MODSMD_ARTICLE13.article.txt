In "Penelope's Irish Experi
ences," by Kate Douglas Wiggin,
the readers of the Atlantic Monthly
have the third and alas! the final
group of the delightful Penelope
papers. This charming heroine
has always insisted upon reviewing
the scenery and customs and peo
ple of Great Britain through her
own honest and sparkling Ameri
can eyes, and her adventures on
Irish turf are as revelatory of the
American temperament as they
are true to the soil of Ireland.
Mrs. Wiggin knows her Ireland
too well to forget a touch of Celtic
romance, and a pretty love story
develops in connection with our
old friend Salemina. The five di
visions of the book are represented
by Leinster, Munster, Ulster, Con
naught, and Royal Meath. Mrs.
Wiggin has never done a more
clever and delicious story than the
"Irish Experiences," which will
appear in the Atlantic as a six
part serial, beginning in Novem
ber, 1900.
