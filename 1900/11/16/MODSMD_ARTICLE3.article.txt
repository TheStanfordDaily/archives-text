Dr. J. H. Kellogg, surgeon-in
chief of the liattle Creek, Mich.,
Sanitarium, lectured on college
athletics before a large audience in
the chapel Ibis afternoon. The
lecture was entertaining and in
structive. He said:
''The people of today are con
fronted with the question, how to
make a better type of men. The
average man today is not equal to
the strong robust man of 100 years
ago. Everybody should take ex
ercise, for he needs it as much as
he needs food.

"A great majority of the people,
and especially students, have curv
ature of the spine, caused by an
unhygienic mode of sitting and
studying. In examining eighty
four girls at an Eastern college, 1
found that eighty-one had curva
ture of the spine. The human
body is a temple and should be
made strong and healthy. We
should cultivate health so that in
twenty years from now we will not
be affected by the ravages of time.
As we get health fr«m our environ
ment, we must l»e careful in choos
ing our surroundings.
"One should not sit in the same
posture for a long period of time
when he is studying. It is found
to be a great benefit to walk
around, in this„way not only rest
ing the mind, but also stirring up
the latent blood.
"The men of George Washing
ton's time possessed more vigor and
muscle than do the men of the
twentieth century. Washington
without spikes made a world record
that has defied modern athletes un
til last year. Everyone should be
interested in getting strong and
vigorous. The training and exer
cise of muscles goes hand in hand
with training the brain. When
the muscles get lax the brain is al
so brought into a similar condition.
"The food that we eat should he
nourishing. We cannot hope to
get the strength of the ox by eat
ing ox steaks. Meat does not give
so much nourishment as is com
monly supposed. Meat would not
have any flavor if the blood was
washed out of it."
