# Freshman Glee.
## 
### 
The committee of arrangements
in charge of the Freshman Glee
held a meeting yesterday afternoon
in Iloble Hall. Encina club-room
has been secured for the dance,
which will be given on December
7th. Judging from the large num
ber who have signified their inten
tion of attending, the dance prom
ises to be very successful. It is
very likely that Yanke's orchestra
will lie obtained for the occasion.
Tickets will be put on sale in a few
days at the Bookstore.
