## Tomorrow's Game. — Raitt Heard From.—Secret Practice Next Week. 
### 
Saturday afternoon is the last
football game of the season, when
the Varsity plays Nevada on the
campus. I'racticaHy the whole
Varsity squad will go into the
game, giving every man a chance.
An easy victory is of course ex
pected, but the game will be an
interesting one from the point of
view of comparative scores. The
game will be called promptly at
two o'clock. The regular tifty
certt admission will be charged.
The teams will line up as follows:
STANFORD. NEVADA.

A telegram was received by Man
ager (jildersleevd today from Chas.
B. Raitt, who went home a few
days ago on account of the illness
of his father, stating that his fath
er died yesterday, and that he is
uncertain as to whether or not he
will come back to col lege this semes
ter. Hopes are entertained by the
management that Raitt may be
able to return, as without his pres
ence on the team there will be a
vacancy diflicult to fill. Raitt has
been playing a star game, and his
loss so late in the season would be
almost irreparable. Erb, who has
been playing a star game at half
back, may be moved to quarter,
lie is the most experienced availa
ble candidate, and is excellent at
backing up the line. Bansbach,
the plucky Freshman quarter-back
and captain, is Erb's only compet
itor, and with the exception of
experience, in which Erb has the
advantage, they are about even.
Beginning Monday, the football
practice will be secret, with the ex
ception of Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The team will not leave the cam
pus until the morning of the big
game, and the secret practice here
takes the place of the trip to the
bills or Del Monte. Only the Var
sity squad and the second team
will be allowed inside the gates ex
cept on the public days.
