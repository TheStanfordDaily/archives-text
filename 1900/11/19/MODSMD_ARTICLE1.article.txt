## Nevada Crosses Stanford's Goal for the First Time This Season. 
### 
The game with Nevada last Sat
urday afternoon, which everyone
predicted would be any easy vic
tory for Stanford, proved the great
est surprise that has come to Stan
ford for many years. After Berke
ley overwhelmed the Nevada team
by 32 to 0, we had a right to ex
pect a victory, inasmuch as our
own team has been playing in bet
ter form than has California's.
Instead of the walkover that we
should have had, however, we have
to face the fact that a team drawn
from 112 male students, and which
our Freshman team could ordi
narily have at least prevented from
scoring, has beaten us, the (irst
time that our goal has been crossed
this season by an outside eleven.
That we could have beaten them
under ordinary circumstances,
cannot be denied, and this makes
our defeat all the harder to bear.
Of course the field was muddy
and the ball was hard to handle,
but this was as fair for one team
as for the other. The secret of Ne
vada's success lies in the fact that
our team was overconfident and
careless. The fumbles that oc
curred were so numerous that it
seemed to the bleachers that the
ball was dropped as often as it was
passed successfully. Fast work
was out of the question, and the
team showed that a few speedy
backs cannot play the game alone,
especially when they cannot uti
lize their speed. The line men
failed to put the proper amount of
aggressiveness into their play and
seemed absolutely unable to hold
on the Nevada bucks. The game
is a much-needed lesson to us, as it
shows that there are some features
of our play which simply must be
improved if we beat Berkeley, and
that our chances for Thanksgiving
are not as sure as a great many
are inclined to think.
The mud was horrible. After
every down the players came up
plastered from head to foot, to have
the slush scraped from their faces.
Their feet were so clogged with
mud (hat fast work was impossible,
and if a man was able to get a
good start he was almost sure to
lose bis feet before he had gone
any distance.
The ball was in Stanford terri
tory nearly a.l the time and the
Cardinal never got within striking
distance of the Nevada goal. The
score was made in the first half of
the game when Geissler dropped
Keddie's kick on the two-yard line
and a blue jersey fell on the ball.
It took only two bucks for a touch
down, and Keddie kicked the goal,
making the score (5 to 0 in favor of
the visitors. The rest of the game
was simply a series of short rushes,
with three attempts at field goal
by Keddie, all of which failed.
Nevada played remarkably well,
but the Varsity was raggedness
itself.
For Stanford, Slaker played the
best game. lie tackled and bucked
in bis regular Varsity form.
Hill was not himself at nil. Allen
played a good game and on several
occasions got a good start which

with helj) might h;ive amounted to
something. But there was no help
to he had. The line failed to get
into the interference or to hold, so
nothing could he expected of the
hacks. Seeley was not up to form,
his defense being particularly
weak.
For Nevada, C. Smith, the giant
guard, was the star of the line, and
he clearly outclassed Nutter and
Emerson. Keddie played a good
game, his kicks playing no small
part in the sagebrush victory.
Mitchell and Sunderland were gen
erally good for gains. The best
part of Nevada's work, however,
was her superb defense and team
work.
It is generally conceded that
had Raitt been in the game the re
sult would have been different.
The team missed him behind the
line, and his way of receiving
punts and passing the ball would
have possibly saved the day. This
together with the unusual condi
tions are ascribed as two great fac
tors in Nevada's victory. It is
only just to add, however, that the
sagebrush boys outplayed us from
start to finish, and earned their
score.

Oregon defeated California Sat
urdsiy by a score of 2 to 0, made
on a safety. There is some conso
lation for Stanford in the fact that
the team which we defeated 34 to 0
at least prevented California from
scoring. It slightly mitigates the
chagrin which we would otherwise
feel for having allowed Berkeley's
32 to 0 victims make a touchdown
against us.
The game with Nevada last Sat
urday afternoon, which everyone
predicted would be any easy vic
tory for Stanford, proved the great
est surprise that has come to Stan
ford for many years. After Berke
ley overwhelmed the Nevada team
by 32 to 0, we had a right to ex
pect a victory, inasmuch as our
own team has been playing in bet
ter form than has California's.
Instead of the walkover that we
should have had, however, we have
to face the fact that a team drawn
from 112 male students, and which
our Freshman team could ordi
narily have at least prevented from
scoring, has beaten us, the (irst
time that our goal has been crossed
this season by an outside eleven.
That we could have beaten them
under ordinary circumstances,
cannot be denied, and this makes
our defeat all the harder to bear.
Of course the field was muddy
and the ball was hard to handle,
but this was as fair for one team
as for the other. The secret of Ne
vada's success lies in the fact that
our team was overconfident and
careless. The fumbles that oc
curred were so numerous that it
seemed to the bleachers that the
ball was dropped as often as it was
passed successfully. Fast work
was out of the question, and the
team showed that a few speedy
backs cannot play the game alone,
especially when they cannot uti
lize their speed. The line men
failed to put the proper amount of
aggressiveness into their play and
seemed absolutely unable to hold
on the Nevada bucks. The game
is a much-needed lesson to us, as it
shows that there are some features
of our play which simply must be
improved if we beat Berkeley, and
that our chances for Thanksgiving
are not as sure as a great many
are inclined to think.
The mud was horrible. After
every down the players came up
plastered from head to foot, to have
the slush scraped from their faces.
Their feet were so clogged with
mud (hat fast work was impossible,
and if a man was able to get a
good start he was almost sure to
lose bis feet before he had gone
any distance.
The ball was in Stanford terri
tory nearly a.l the time and the
Cardinal never got within striking
distance of the Nevada goal. The
score was made in the first half of
the game when Geissler dropped
Keddie's kick on the two-yard line
and a blue jersey fell on the ball.
It took only two bucks for a touch
down, and Keddie kicked the goal,
making the score (5 to 0 in favor of
the visitors. The rest of the game
was simply a series of short rushes,
with three attempts at field goal
by Keddie, all of which failed.
Nevada played remarkably well,
but the Varsity was raggedness
itself.
For Stanford, Slaker played the
best game. lie tackled and bucked
in bis regular Varsity form.
Hill was not himself at nil. Allen
played a good game and on several
occasions got a good start which

with helj) might h;ive amounted to
something. But there was no help
to he had. The line failed to get
into the interference or to hold, so
nothing could he expected of the
hacks. Seeley was not up to form,
his defense being particularly
weak.
For Nevada, C. Smith, the giant
guard, was the star of the line, and
he clearly outclassed Nutter and
Emerson. Keddie played a good
game, his kicks playing no small
part in the sagebrush victory.
Mitchell and Sunderland were gen
erally good for gains. The best
part of Nevada's work, however,
was her superb defense and team
work.
It is generally conceded that
had Raitt been in the game the re
sult would have been different.
The team missed him behind the
line, and his way of receiving
punts and passing the ball would
have possibly saved the day. This
together with the unusual condi
tions are ascribed as two great fac
tors in Nevada's victory. It is
only just to add, however, that the
sagebrush boys outplayed us from
start to finish, and earned their
score.
