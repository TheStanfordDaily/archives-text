Editor Daily I'alo Alto:
I wish to take exception to Fri
day's editorial regarding rooters'
caps upon two grounds: First, the
fact that the seats in the rooting
section will he individually re
served will not interfere with the
general effect. The men in the
rooting section will he sitting just
as close together as last year and,
if everyone in the rooting section is
wearing cardinal, the mass of color
will he more striking than ever.
Second, the Executive Committee,
which is chosen to settle just such
questions, has appealed to every
student to turn up at the game
with a cap, so that the suggestion
to adopt some other mark of dis
tinction is inappropriate. Those
who noticed the caps worn at Sat
urday's game will agree that no
more effective insignia could he
found. The success of this plan
depends only upon the loyalty of
the student hody.
