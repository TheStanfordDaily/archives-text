# SUNDAY SERMON.
## "Love Is the Fulfilling of the Law" Was the Subject of Rev. Haskell's Discourse. 
### 
Rev. N. A. Haskell, formerly
pastor of the First Unitarian
Church of San Jose, preached the
sermon in the chapel Sunday.
His text was: "Love is the fulfill
ing of the law." He said:
"A new thought of evolution of
man and of human destiny is tak
ing possession of the minds of men
in this modern iige. This new
thought must express itself in
higher ways of living. The new
ethics is the outcome of this new
thought of life. The end and aim
of the ethics of that era in human
progress, now nearing its close, is
personal salvation. In the teach
ings of the Christian churches it
found expression in the doctrine
of rewards and punishments to he
meted out in a life after death.
In philosophy it expressed itself
in the ethics of hedonism and utili
tarianism. The new ethics rises
above purely personal interests. Jt
regards die individual man as an
expression of the Universal Life.
He is an incarnation of the race
soul. The higher ethics requires
him to live the life of the soul, se
renely above the thought of its per
sonal outcome.
"Schiller defines three relations
of man with himself. The first is
the denial of the sense nature. This
is asceticism. The second is the
subjection of the moral and reason
able nature to the sensuous. This
is the sensual. The third is the
relation wherein harmony is estab
lished between the impulsions of
the one and the laws of the other.
This is the ideal. When this har
mony is gained, then a man can
trust himself. He is no longer at
war with himself. His instincts
lead him in the path of duty. He
can trust himself to them. For
then love fulfills the law. But the
instinctive life cannot be gained
until the sensuous and the moral
natures are in accord. Duty will
surrender her throne only to one
whose authority is higher than her
own. She worships the highest,
and the Divinity supreme in the
family of the gods is Love.
"The beautiful soul must first of
all be in accord with itself. It will
deny no part of the nature its
rightful expression. It will enter
into the full enjoyment of the outer
life of the sense's, it will be con
scious of the beauty of the world
and of life and will rejoice in it;
but all this that touches it upon
the sensuous side of its being it
will hold in adjustment to the in
ner moral and spiritual life. It
will live upon the whole range of
its being.
"The man who is possessed of
this noble soul will not make hap
piness of self or even of others the
regulative principle of his conduct.
Neither will he descend to the ma
terial levels of utility. The ideals
of this man will be within his own
soul. He will live the soul-life,
and enter upon the highest ranges
of thought and feeling and follow
its ideals at whatever cost or sacri
fice, for the reason that he cannot,
if true to himself, do otherwise."
