Last Saturday's defeat was a
bitter disappointment to Stanford,
which is but slightly alleviated
when we think that California also
suffered a similar defeat. The de
feat was all the more hitter, in that
it was bo entirely unexpected. Not
one of the rooters Saturday hut
confidently expected an easy vic
tory and ii large score. It v.*as
humiliating in the extreme to see
our team hen ten and outplayed by
a second-rate team that has en
joyed none of the privileges in the
way of treatment and coaching
that our team has experienced.
But then there are extenuating cir
cumstances that might lie weighed,
the condition of the field and the
fact that, the team was seriously
weakened by the lons of several of
its strongest playeis. Still this
does not explain away the fact that
our men used poor judgment all
through the game, with but few ex
ceptions. The team put up a hard
fight all the way through, but did
not seem to be able to accomplish
anything. It showed most con
clusively Stanford's weak point, —
on defense. Still the fact remains
that with the rest of the team back
•in their old positions, with the
added confidence <>112 strengthened
team and superior coaching, Stan
ford's chances are of the brightest
for the final game.
