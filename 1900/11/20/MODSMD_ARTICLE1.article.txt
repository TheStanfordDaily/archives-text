## Secret Practice to Be Held for the Rest of the Football Season. 
### 
Lust night Couch Yost began se
cret practice, which will last from
now until Thanksgiving. Owing
to ihe condition of the athletic
field, the teams practiced on the
lield between Roble and Lagunita,
where practices will he held until
the weather permits the gridiron
to he used again.
Practice last night was confined
to putting the Varsity through de
fensive work in order to strengthen
it on its weak side.
Secret practice will continue
from now until Thanksgiving, al
though in all probability there will
he one more public practice in or
der to make a "jolly-up" occasion,
sometime this week.
During the practice last night,
Lee at center injured his knee, but
not seriously, and Caglieri was put
in his place.
The injured men are recovering
rapidly. Do Forest, who has been
•out of the game on account of a
sore arm which threatened to de
velop into blood poisoning, is now
nearly well, and will soon occupy
his old position. Burnett's injured
knee still keeps him out of the
scrimmage, but with ii few days
rest his 'eg will soon be well again.
Raitt will in all probability re
turn to college in time for the
Thanksgiving game. No definite
news has been received from him
as yet, but Coach Yost confidently
expects to have him back in time.
There has been talk of doing
away with the annual football ral
ly this year that has always been
the great feature of the close of the
season. This is due to the fact
that the team will stay at the Uni
versity this year instead of going
away for secret practice as has
been the custom for many years
past.
Instead of the rally it has been
proposed to hold a meeting of the
rooters for the purpose of practic
ing songs and yells. The rally has
been such a feature of the football
season that it is very likely that
the practice will be kept up.
