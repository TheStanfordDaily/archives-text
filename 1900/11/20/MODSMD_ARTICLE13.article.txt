The action of the more conserva
tive members of the faculty last
night in discussing the Dr. Ross
episode is one that should he fol
lowed hy the student hody. It
would seem that this whole affair
had gone far enough, and it was
expected that last week had closed
the matter, hut it does not seem to
down. Through the earnest efforts
of the San Francisco journals in
their eagerness to dish up a deli
cious sensation, and also the eager
ness of those who should he the
University's warmest supporters, in
order to secure a little notoriety
and self-advertisement, it has been
carried 100 far. Now that the cooler
element has come to the rescue, per
haps the rest will realize their posi
tion and what they owe to the Uni
versity of which they are members,
and what is due to the loyalty and
self-devotion of its founders. The
student hody as a whole should
realize the position in which we
are placed and endeavor to rally to
the support of the President of the
University, and not he so free in
their criticism of his action. Our
President should he supported and
aided, not criticised and ahused,
when his action is and always has
been for the best interests of the
University.
The students, the alumni, and
friends of the University seem to
forget what Mrs. Stanford lias done
for the University and the people
generally. Is her unselfish devo
tion to this institution in its time
of need to be forgotten in the first
moments of our displeasure? As yet
we have heard only one side of the
story. We know nothing of Mrs.
Stanford's real reasons for her ac
tion. It is time that we should
come to our senses and to the aid
of our Aima Mater, and by a de
cent conservatism bring the affair
out with as much credit as possible.
