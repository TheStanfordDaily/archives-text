## 
### 
There was no picture taken of
the football team that could be fin
ished before late this week, and as
the Chaparral will present among
its supplements a half-tone from
the photograph, it will be imposs
ible to issue the paper tomorrow as
was first intended. The paper will
contain other half-tone supple
ments, and will have rubricated
initials and special matter for
Thanksgiving. Among other at
tractions will l>e the "Rubaiyat of
Over-Confidence," and a football
story on an entirely new line of
plot, by Larrey Bowman, '01.
