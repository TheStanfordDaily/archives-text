# Sale of Seats.
## 
### 
On account of the rain the s:ile
of seats for Thanksgiving, out
side of those reserved for rooters,
whs small. The sale was held in
the worst place on the campus from
the standpoint of the purchasers,
and for two hours they were
obliged to stand in the mud and
rain waiting their turn in the line.

Only a few women braved the
weather for the sake of first choice
of seats, though enough men
showed up to take all the rooting
section seats and a smattering of
other reservations. If every man
in the rooting section provides him
self with a rooter's cap that section
of the grandstand will look like a
flame. Constant inquiries have
been made today for seats., but ow
ing to the absence of Treasurer
Taylor it is impossible to announce
tonight when the sale will be re
sumed.
Tickets for the game went on
Bale at Berkeley at 1:30 p.m. yes
terday and at 6 o'clock 150 per
sons had been able to buy tickets
the sales amounting to $1753,
Students were admitted one at a
time into the Armory where the
tickets were sold, and at the en
trance preference was given stu
dents who had paid their student
body assessments. This restriction
caused unfavorable comment, es
pecially from the alutani, many of
whom had purchased season tick
ets, just, as they expressed it, to
help the management out.
