Mrs. Judith Ellen Foster of
Washington, 1). 0., spoke to the
students in the chapel this after
noon on the Red Cross work. She
said:
"The lied Cross has come to
mean an aid and a blessing to
charity. Jt does just a little more
toward protecting and caring for
unfortunates than the government
pledges itself to do. There is war
everywhere at the present time and
has been for ages, but it is only as
recent as our late civil war that any
organized effort was made to miti
gate the evils of war. An effort
was then made in the United States
and at about the same time a
movement was started in Europe.
"In Switzerland a good man
lived who had visited the many
battle-fields of Europe, and was
moved by the evils connected with
them. He called a conference in
Geneva in 1863 to consider meth
ods of lessening the evils of war.
At this conference were present
representatives from eight different
nations of Europe who prevailed
upon their respective governments
to adopt in 1804 a treaty in which
they pledged themselves to regard
as neutral all persons engaged in
Red Cross work and to protect
their stores wherever found.

''Clara Barton, who was in Eu
rope at the time of the Geneva
Conference, delegated herself as a
committee of one to place the mat
ter before the United States govern
ment and in 1882 succeeded in
getting this nation to ratify the
treaty. The United States was
backward in this matter, being the
fortieth nation to accept the terms;
once she took it up she asked that
the work of the society be enlarged
to not only include the mitigation
of the evils of war but also all dis
asters of a national character.
This provision has been incorpor
ated in the international agree
ment."
