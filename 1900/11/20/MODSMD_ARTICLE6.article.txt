# Statues for Quadrangle.
## 
### 
A group statue representing
Senator and Mrs. Stanford, with
Leland Stanford, Jr., was received
from Italy recently and has just
been putin place on the granite
pedestal in the quadrangle. The
figures are of bronze, and modelled
in heroic size. The Senator stands
erect at the right of the group,
while Mrs. Stanford assumes a
half-kneeling posture at the left.
Between and supported by the
arms of his parents is the son who
holds in his hands a half-opened
scroll. The statues face the arch
and the main entrance. They
were sent direct by Mrs. Stanford,
who is now in Venice, Italy.
