# Alumni Meeting.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Alumni
Association which will he held in
the city this evening it is likely
that the conservative element will
prevail, and that nothing of a rad
ical nature will result from the call
for a meeting. A poll of the most
prominent alumni, made in San
Francisco today by a representa
tive of the Daily Palo Alto,showed
that there was a clear feeling
against taking any part in the con
troversy, and for allowing the
whole discussion to die down. If
any definite resolution comes from
the meeting tonight, it will take
the form of discountenance of any
action that has so far been taken
by any alumnus on either side,
and decrying the action of any one
who has sought or may seek to
mix the alumni as a body in the
affair. The meeting may take a
different trend, but at present it
looks as if the views set forth above
will prevail.
