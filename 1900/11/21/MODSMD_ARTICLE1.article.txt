# WET WEATHER FOOTBALL.
## Varsity Practice of Next Few Days Likely to Be of Value in Case of a Rainy Thanksgiving. 
### 
Every coach who comes here
from the lOast has to lit his meth
ods to California conditions, and a
large amount of the success of this
year's team will depend on how
far Coach Yost will meet the new
conditions that come with a wet
day and a sloppy field. So far we
have built up a good, quick, offen
sive style of play, efficacious on a
hard field, but on a soft, muddy
and slippery ground that quickness
on the offensive is lost, and the
men do not seem to get into the
play at all. This was shown by
the inability of the line to hold,
and of the backs to get started, in
the Nevada game. Various reasons
are still being given for the loss of
that game, among others the fear
of the management against losing
money by playing on the baseball
grounds where we would have had
a better chance at winning, and
the other that De Forest, who being
an Oregonian, and therefore know
ing how to play in the mud, was
out of the game with a bad arm.
After today, however, De Forest
will be back at his old position and
will materially stiffen the left side
of the line.. So much is this ques
tion of a soft or hard field taken
into consideration as affecting
Stanford's chances that bettors in
the city are* holding off 011 their
wagers until they know the condi
tion of the field on. Thanksgiving
day.
Hut Yost is working his men in
these iast few days so that they
will be able to cope with any con
ditions that confront them, and all
of his past records go to show that
most of his success comes from the
secret practice of the last few weeks,
and if we are to have a rainy day
on the twenty-ninth the present
rains have come very opportunely
to familiarize coach and men with
the difficulties of mud and water.
Another thing that brings joy to
the hearts of the Stanford rooters
is the announcement contained in
a telegram to Manager Gildersleeve
that Railt will positively return to
the University next Friday or Sat
urday, and that he will be in the
last days of practice before the big
g;i me.
Following is last night's line-up:
VARSITY. SECOND.

The practice last night was in 1
the field beyond the University
Drugstore, where the ground has
been putin fair condition and goal
posts erected. The second team 1
played on the offensive throughout 1
the practice, and the Varsity played
a strong game in defense. Hill got.|
the ball on a fumble, however, and 1

made a touchdown for the Varsity.
Only once did the Varsity weaken,
when near the end of the practice
Wardall broke through the line
and scored a touchdown for the
second. Nourse, who is just out
again from a severe ease of tonsil
itis, played a good game for the
second at left half, and got a badly
sprained wrist.
Hereafter all practices will be se
cret, and there will be signal prac
tice at night in the gym. After
today there are likely to be two
practices daily.
