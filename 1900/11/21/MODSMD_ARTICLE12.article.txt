The action of the alumni at
their meeting in San Francisco can
have but one result, if they per
sist, in their demand for a thorough
investigation they only tend to re
vive and prolong an episode that
has already received enough pub
licity and notoriety, indeed far too
much for the best interests of the
University which thev as alumni
are supposed above all things to
protect. There can be no doubt
that there is nothing to be gained
by any such action on the part of
the alumni, as it is very doubtful
that any new light can be thrown
on the matter, which has already
been so thoroughly threshed out by
the newspapers. The best interests
of the University should demand
that the alumni should stand with
their University and its authori
ties, not against it.. What do the
alumni expect to gain by their ac
tion? Out of respect to Mrs. .Stan
ford and her wishes they could do
far more good by acquiescing to
her action and that of Dr. Jordan
by letting any plans for an inves
tigation drop, and give the Uni
versity authorities a chance to set
tle their own affairs as best they
may.
