# Thanksgiving Game Seats.

### 
Football seats for the Thanks
giving game are going with a rush.
Yesterday was the first day of the
city sale And there was a steady
demand at Clabrough-Golcher's
and at Skinner's on Market street.
Long lines of buyers under um
brellas besiege! the local offices
from early in the morning. The
campus sale on Monday was unus
ually large. Over two thousand
tickets have been sold on our own
campus, which is the largest sale
ever made here at Stanford. Seats
will be on sale at the Bookstore for
several days, and those who have
ordered tickets can get them here
where they have been laid aside for
them. Eight more days tickets
will be on sale at the two San
Francisco stores, at the University
Club, and on the Berkeley campus.
The prospects are that the entire
supply will be bought up before
the match.
This year there are accommoda
tions for 17,250 spectators. There
are individually reserved seats for
15,288 people, unreserved seats for
about 1,500, and standing room for
about 500. If the accommodations
should be completely occupied at
the prevailing prices the total pro
ceeds of the great gridiron battle
would be about $83,000.
The east side of the field has a
mammoth uncovered grandstand
thirty-four tiers high and seating
8,180 people.
The rooting section tickets have
all been sold, and a great many
more have applied for seats in this
section than there were tickets.
The old covered baseball grand
stand at the south end of the
grounds, accommodating 1,100 peo
ple, is not individually reserved,
but seats are $1.50. The little open
bleachers near the southeast corner,
holding about 400 people, and an
inclined floor close to the south
end of the field for about 500 stand
ing spectators will hold the general
admission at $1 each.
There will be no side-line boxes
this year and very few men on the
side lines, so that the thousands in
the rising tiers of seats will have a
line, unobstructed view at all times.
Tickets will be 011 sale tomorrow
at the Bookstore for the Columbia
Theatre Thanksgiving night. Price
one dollar and one dollar and a
half.
The sale of seats today at the
Bookstore, while not as large as
Monday's, was still large, about
$1,000 worth of tickets having been
sold.
