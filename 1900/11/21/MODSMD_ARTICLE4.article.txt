# ALUMNI TAKE ACTION.
## The 						Graduates Hold a Stormy Meeting and Demand an Investigation. 
### 
Over sixty graduates of Stan
ford University held a meeting
last night in the Assembly Hall
of the Young Men's Christian As
sociation building in San Fran
cisco and unanimously adopted the
following resolutions:
Resolved, That we, the Stanford
alumni in San Francisco, are not
in possession of the whole facts on
both sides of the Ross incident, and
suspend judgment pending a full
and immediate investigation of
the facts by a committee elected to
interview Dr. Jordan, Dr. Ross,
and other parties concerned.
Resolved, That we, as Stanford
alumni residing in San Francisco,
declare publicly that we knew
nothing of the Ross incident prior
to the recent election, and that we
believe President Jordan's state
ment that Mrs. Stanford's final
action was not known to him un
til after election day.
Resolved, That we proclaim pub
licly that the Stanford alumni in
San Francisco have taken no ac
tion whatever in the Ross incident
and disclaim any responsibility for
any published statements purport
ing to represent our views.
After adopting these resolutions,
everyone present voted for five
men to wait upon Dr. Jordan and
Dr. Ross personally, and get at
the complete facts. Those elected
to the committee were: A. H. Suz
zallo, '99, Archie Pice, '95, Charles
M. Fickert, '98, Walter M. Rose,
'5)5, and Charles K. Field, '95.
As soon n.s the facts are known,
in confidence or otherwise, this
committee will make its report to
the San Francisco Alumni Associ
ation.
