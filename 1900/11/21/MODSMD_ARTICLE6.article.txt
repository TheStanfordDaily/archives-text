### 
The date of the Pacific Coast
Students' Conference has been
changed from the summer vaca
tion, at which time it inevitably
conflicted with the commencement
of either Berkeley or Stanford, to
the winter vacation. It will as
usual occur at Pacific Grove, be
ginning December 28th and closing
January 6th.
This students' conference is one
of four held under tiie direction of
the International Committee of
the Young .Men's Christian Associ
ation. It is convened for ten days,
the mornings being given up to
four sessions, while the afternoons
are devoted entirely to field sports,
baseball, tramps, and drives. Last
summer the Stanford delegation
won the baseball series and was
second to Berkeley by only one
half a point in the field-day.
Last May there were seventy
five men in attendance, represent

ing twenty institutions from the
states of Washington, Idaho. Ore
gon, Nevada, and California.
One of the pleasing and very
helpful features of the conference
is the platform sessions of the
morning. The students will he
addressed this year by Mr. John
R. Molt, Dr. E. R. Dill© of Oak
land, Rev. H. C. Min ton of San
Anselmo, Rev. FredrricU W. Clamp
ett of San Francisco, Mr. Jlenry J.
McCoy of San Francisco, and
others.
The conference offers an excel
lent opportunity for the men who
are too far from home to return
to spend a jolly and profitable out
ing away from the University and
at a nominal expense.
