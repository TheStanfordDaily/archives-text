# Rooters' Meeting.
## 
### 
Cards are being sent out to all
those who h.ive purchased rooters'
tickets, < i a I ling them to a meeting
to be held in the chapel Friday
evening. This meeting is called
for the purpose of practicing the
songs and yells. At this meeting
the advisability of perfecting a per
manent organization of the rooters
into some sort of a rooters' club
that will be a permanent feature of
the student organization and will
have charge of the yelling will be
discussed.
Through some misunderstanding
this meeting for Friday has been
confounded with the regular an
nual football rally which marks
the close of the season, and which
is always looked .forward to with
expectancy. Jt has been rumored
that the rooters' meeting was to
take the place of the rally. How
ever, it is now announced that the
grand rally will take place next
Tuesday evening.
