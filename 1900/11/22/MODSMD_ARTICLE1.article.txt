# SECRET PRACTICE.
## Team Work Being Perfected and Substitutes Being Developed. 
### 
The Varsity is keeping up its
work in the mud to an excellent
advantage these days. Team work
is being perfected as much as pos
sible and every man in the squad
is beginning to know his place in
the interference by instinct. Coach
Yost proposes to have twenty-two
men, any eleven of which can go
into the Thanksgiving game with
out interrupting the clock-like
team work which the coach is de
veloping.
Raitt's absence during the week
has in reality been of benefit to the
team as a whole, as it has brought
out candidates for sub-quarter, and
the team has become accustomed to
working with another man in the
snap-back position. Bansbach has
been doing some very good work
anil this week's experience will be
invaluable to him if, in case of
emergency, he should be called in
to the game. Raitt will be back
tomorrow in time to be in the last
few days of practice.
Burnett is still very lame, but
will probably be able to go into
the game. If he should be com
pelled to retire, Tom McFadden
will probably be moved up to the
tackle position, while either Erb,
Geissler, or Luck will go in at Mc-
Fadden's place at end. These men
are being worked at the position,
and the change if made will not
interfere with team work. McFad
den should be able to put up a
strong play at tackle, as he has
both weight and quickness and is
anjexperienced and aggressive man.
Stanford is being tried at Cooper's
end, and is playing good ball.
Joe de Forest is running signals,
and is in good physical condition
with the exception of his arm, and
that will be all right by next
Thursday. He may be expected to
put up his usual steady and con
sistent game. Lee is again in good
shape after a wrenched knee. See
ley has not had a serious accident
during the season, and is playing a
good offensive game. He is doing
better defensive work than former
ly, but there is still room for im
provement in this branch of his
work.
Following is last night's line-up:

Berkeley played San Jose Nor
mal today on the California cam
pus. Stanford twice defeated the
Normal, 35-0 and 24-0 respective
ly, and the report from the Berke
ley game is eagerly awaited.

The sale of tickets for both the
Thanksgiving game and the theatre
on Thanksgiving evening is going
on briskly. All the theatre tickets
that are on sale here but twenty
five are already sold and the
chances are that they will soon be
gone. The total sale of football
tickets to date amounts to $2800
as against a total sale of <11800 on
the campus last year. There are
a few good seats left but in a few
days those remaining unsold vvi'l
be transferred to the city so it will
be well for those intending to at
tend the game to get their tickets
at once.
