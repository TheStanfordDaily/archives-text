Tiie Yah News and the Pennsyl
vanian have been having quite a
discussion about their respective
university bands. The contro
versy grew out of an editorial which
appeared in the Vole News in the is
sue of October 3d, and which said:
"A band in a university is a unique
feature of which Harvard and Vale
alone can boast." The writer also
spoke of its "maiden efforts last
year." One would judge from the
editorial that the Yale band is only
one year old, and that the Harvard
band is not more than a year or
two older. The Pennsylvanian had
this to say in reply to the NewB:
"We wish to refute the broad asser
tion that carries such an amount
of exclusiveness by saying that a
band has been in existence at Penn
sylvania since 1897, or for three
years."
The above will sound very amus
ing to the students of our two Cali
fornia universities, as both of these
colleges have for years had first
class bands which have always ac
companied their respective teams
to San Francisco on Thanksgiving
for the intercollegiate football
game. The Stanford band was
formed in 1892 and has had a suc
cessful existence of eight years. It
includes twenty-five pieces and the
University may well feel proud of
it. There are universities outside
of the big four.
