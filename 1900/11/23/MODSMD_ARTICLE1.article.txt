# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Second Unable to Penetrate Varsity's Defense.—First Team Improving. 
### 
A small crowd was out at foot
ball practice last night to watch
the Varsity and second line up.
That the Varsity is improving in
the last two weeks cannot be de
nied. Last night the ball was
given to the second for any num
ber of downs consecutively, and
try as they would they could not
penetrate the Varsity's line for any
distance. The forwards on the
first team are learning to get to
gether in a way that is decidedly
encouraging. They presented a
solid front to the lierce bucks of
the second's backs, and only a few
times were the latter able to make
any impression at all.
When the conditions were re
versed and the ball given to the
Varsity, their offensive work was
on a par with their defensive. The
backs made .their distance repeat
edly, and finally Erb broke through
and made a long run for a touch
down. The second team is not an
aggregation of ''scrub" players,
but of men who know the game
and can play it, and it is no little
thing for the Varsity to show up
well against them. Gregory and
Harper are two very valuable men
and would make a strong addition
to any squad. Barnhisel and
Thompson at the guard positions
are also a good pair and get under
the play in good shape.
Following is last night's line-up:

Slaker was out last night, but
did not take part in the line-up.
He went into the signal practice in
good form, however. De Forest's
arm is about well now, and he
went into the line-up last night.
His long rest, seems to have been a
good thing for him, as he went into
the play with a dash that was sur
prising even for l)e Forest. Stan
ford, the gritty Freshman halfback,
has been doing some very high
class work at end, and smashes
into the interference like a veteran.
Tom McFadden seems perfectly at
home in Burnett's position, where
he has been working as a possible
substitute, and is also playing his
end in good form. Cooper's work
is up to his usual standard. He
plays a steady game and can al
ways be depended upon. Lee is
slightly handicapped in his center
work by his bad knee, but will un
doubtedly be in good shape by
next Thursday. If he should be
forced to retire from the game, Mc-
Fadden will make a good substi
tute. He plays the snap-back

position in good style, and is one
of the most aggressive line men on
the lield.
The announced return of Haiti
has caused much rejoicing among
the student body. The presence of
the plucky little quarter behind
the line will instil confidence into
the team, and his generalship will
mean a great deal in the game next
Thursday, lie will be in the prac
tice next week.
The San Jose Normal School
football team, which Stanford
easily defeated early in the season
by scores of 35-0 and 24-0, was
able yesterday to hold the Uni
versity of California down to a
5-0 score. The first half ended
with no score owing to a mistake
of the timekeeper's with the ball a
foot from Normal's goal and fifteen
seconds yet to play. One touch
down was made in the second half,
so the score should in reality have
been about 10-0.
Normal's strength was a sur
prise to California. The school
l)oys were able to hold on downs
repeatedly and played a plucky
uphill game against their heavier
opponents.
The game was played on a
muddy field and was consequently
not an exhibition of fast football.
The rooters, however, were expect
ing two or three touchdowns, and
the game was something in the
nature of a disappointment to
them, although Coach Yost ex
pressed himself as well satisfied
with the result.
