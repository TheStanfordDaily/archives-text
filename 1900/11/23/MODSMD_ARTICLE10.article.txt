A state of affairs which is to be
commented favorably upon is the
amicable feeling which exists at
the present time between the sec
ond team, the Varsity, the coach,
and the management. There are
often incidents which arise during
the training season which cause
strained relations between the two
teams, or between the second team
and the coach and management.
This season has been no exception,
and for the last two weeks there
have been petty bickerings between
the members of the two teams,
which have led to rough playing
on the gridiron. The members of
the second team have also felt that
they were not receiving proper
treatment at the hands of the
coach and management because of
misunderstanding the attitude of
the coach, and because they be
lieved that the management did
not intend to repay them in any
way for their hard work in prepar
ing the Varsity for the final strug
gle with Berkeley. These disagree
ments have been adjusted to the
satisfaction of all concerned, and
in a manner which angurs well for
a Cardinal victory if united effort
counts for anything.
