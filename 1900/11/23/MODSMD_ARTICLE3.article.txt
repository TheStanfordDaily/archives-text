# Psychological Tests.
## 
### 
The members of the seminary in
Child Study under the direction of
Professor Starbuek are pursuing
a series of interesting investiga
tions along the line of educational
psychology. These tests are being
performed on students and es
pecially members of the football
squad.
For some time past the seminary
has been working over and tabu
lating results from tests made on
'2400 school children in San Jose
and Santa Clara. These experi
ments were in the nature of psycho
physical tests, in simple reaction
time, judgment time, association
time, discrimation of weights, tones,
and colors, physical skill, endur
ance, and other tests of that na
ture. The primary object in these
tests has been to determine the
lines of development from child
hood to maturity; the periods of
decelerated or retarded growth; and
the parallelism or lack of it in the
rate of growth of the different
functions.
In order to find some basis of
comparison for these results from
children, the seminar}* is carrying
on an elaborate series of the same
experiments on adults. First-hand

j observations are being made rather
| than rely on the results of labora
tory experimentation. The re
| suits of these experiments will fur
nish statistics that will be valu
able as furnishing a comparison
| with those taken from child obser
| vation.
About a dozen different prob
lems are being worked out by the
seminary. One of these is the re
lation between physical and men
tal skill. The football squad has
been selected as probably the best
reagents for this particular ques
tion. The tests were also wanted
by Coach Yost in helping to esti
mate the strong and weak points
in the different players.
