# FOOTBALL.
## Varsity at Signal Work.â€”Raitt's Return Encourages the Coaches. 
### 
The football squad is hard at it
in these last, few days before the
big game, gathering up the loose
ends of the season's work and put
ting on the final touches before the
great contest. Twice a day now
the Varsity is running signals,
with generally a little scrimmage
work in the afternoon against the
second eleven. The morning prac
tice consists of a brisk walk back
into the hills where the men can
have things to themselves, and go
through their formations with no
one to interrupt and nothing to
take their minds from the import
ant details of their work. Even
Saturday there were two practices,
the Varsity being out for team
practice, but there was no line-up,
as not enough second team men
were on the field.
A number of alumni have been
on the campus during the last few
days, assisting the regular coaches.
Among them are Downing, '95,
Code, '96, Frankenheimer, '96,
Plate, ex-'99, and Phil Wilson, ex
'ol. They are giving individual
attention to the men and helping
in the general finishing-off of the
team.
Friday evening's practice was
one of the best of the season. The
Varsity and second lined up and
played hard, fast ball for about
three-quarters of an hour. The
Varsity was put on the defensive
and the second was given the ball.
The second found it a trifle diffi
cult at first to penetrate the Var
sity's defense, and hammered and
hammered at the line either in
vain or for short gains only.
Later, however, thev began in
creasing the length of their bucks
and finally made a touchdown.
Following is the line-up:
VAHSITY. SECOND.

"Stub" Raitt's return to college
has gladdened t he hearts of coaches
and students remarkably. If the
weather continues, with a fast field
and Raitt behind the line, the
Cardinal's chances are extremely
bright for next Thursday. Raitt
was on the train which was
wrecked near Antioch Sunday,
and luckily escaped without in
jury.
Billy Erb's play at halfback is
improving every day. There is no
question about bis ability on (be
defense, as he is easily the best
halfback on the field at this branch
of the game, backing up his line
much after the manner of Forrest
Fisher. His tackling is of a high
order, and he rarely fails to bring
down bis man. Smith's offensive
play is particularly brilliant, but'

his defense is far below what it
should be.
Jf Burnett Bhould be compelled
to retire, and Tom McFadden
should take his place, it looks
very much as though Stanford, who
played a brilliant game at half
back on the Freshman team, will
go in at McFadden's end. The
Freshman is playing a strong
game, remarkably so for a man of
his experience. He will be sure to
give a good account of himself if be
gets into the game. The form
that McFadden is showing in his
play of Burnett's tackle position
is sufficient proof that Coach Yost
will make no mistake in putting
him there.
Joe de Forest is as full of fight
as he ever was and is playing a
dashing game since his enforced
rest. His head work is particu
larly good, and he never fails to do
what is expected of him. ilis play
is not spectacular but be is al
ways in the right place at the right
time.
Over at Berkeley the football
men are working like beavers de
veloping team work. Pringle is
again with his team and Overall at
guard brings two strong men into
their line, and the hopes of the
Blue and Gold are accordingly ris
ing. Practice will end Tuesday
and the remaining time will be
given to resting the men and re
hearsing signals. All of the Berke
ley players are in good condition
except Smith, who is a trifle stale.
