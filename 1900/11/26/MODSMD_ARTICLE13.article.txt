# Yale Defeats Harvard.
## 
### 
Yale defeated Harvard Saturday
by a crushing score of '28-0, the
first triumph of Blue over Crimson
since the memorable game of 1&)4,
which severed the athletic rela
tions of the universities for two
years. From showing made in
previous games, Harvard men
were rather expecting defeat, but
not with so great a score as this.
Yale was superb both in offense
and defense. Her eleven was in
perfect condition, and with the ex
ception of one man, stayed in the
game to the end, while Harvard
played twenty men, and was bat
tered to a standstill at that. The
nearest that Harvard got to a
touchdown was the twenty-yard
line. The game winds up the sea
son so far as these two universities
are concerned. Yale is the ac
knowledged Eastern champion.
Other games:
Washington and Jefferson, 5;
Carlisle Indians, 0.
Brown, 8; Syracuse, 5.
Wisconsin, 28; Illinois, 0.
