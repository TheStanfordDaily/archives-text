### 
The Thanksgiving number of the
Sequoia, which appears tomorrow,
is an athletic number, containing
articles by Coach Yost, Professor
Lewers, Dr. Angel 1, and others.
The frontispiece, drawn by Fran
cis, '03, illustrates the football bal
lad which relates an incident that
many football men will recognize.
''The First Stanford Sweater" tells
a true story that dates back to the
pioneer days. "For Alma Mater"
is the football story proper. The
concluding part of "A Political
Conquest" is the second story.
Other good material goes to make
the magazine by all odds the best
of the year. It is "Stanford" from
one red cover to the othe*.
