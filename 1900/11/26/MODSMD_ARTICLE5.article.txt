# THANKSGIVING SERMON.
## Special Service at the Chapel Yesterday Morning-.—Sermon by Dr. Elliott. 
### 
According to the annual custom
the service in the chapel yesterday
morning was in the nature of a
Thanksgiving service, and was
more elaborate than usual. Besides
the regular music by the choir,
there were solos by Mrs. Smith
and Dr. Little, who also gave a
duet. Professor Murray read Whit
tier's poem, "Eternal Goodness."
The sermon was by Dr. Elliott,
who took for his subject "Like as a
father." He said: "Life is our
adventure into the unknown. It
is the supreme test, and no travel
er's tales which reach us can dull
the keen edge of our own experi
ences or discoveries. On this voy
aging we can go but a little way
before meeting with contradictions.
In this encounter with the world
of experience we are not mere mist
passengers. It is a real encounter;
and how we take it, how we react
upon it, how we direct it is of vast
importance. If a blind fate were
driving us toward a predetermined
end, we might have some curiosity
about the end, but the voyaging
itself would be uninteresting. But
if there is any port at all, we shall
arrive there by virtue of our own
effort and striving in a world fun
damentally good, and with a vision
of that 'one far-off divine event, to
which the whole creation moves.'
"Some of the most terrible con
ceptions of God are found in the
Bible. Those which reflect merely
a rudimentary stage of civilization
in which cunning and cruelty sug
gest no inconsistency we need not
dwell upon. Even in them the
spiritual genius of the Hebrew
people is not wholly wanting. God
is the defender of his chosen peo
ple. For these there is deliverance
and exaltation yet through the dis
cipline of trial and striving.
"From the despair of this dread
ful prison house the Hebrew mind
could not climb to one unassaila
ble height. God might be angry or
jealous or unpropitiated and so evil
passions and sorrow for a time hold
sway. But the vindicator would
appear. Restoration was merely
delayed. The chosen people would
yet be exalted. Modern pessimism
has sunk into a deeper despair.
There is no vindicator. Nature
has her genial moods and her lova- 1
ble aspects. But she is the stern
and unbending law of sequence.
The reality outside man does not
regard man,—-it is utterly indiffer
ent to him. Nothing interferes
with nature, for there is nothing to
interfere with immutable law.
"In Jesus the feeling of the Fath
erhood of God had a new and mar
velous blossoming. What Jesus
apprehended amounted to a discov
ery of God, a revelation. He was
no mere observer. He saw the
sad contrasts. He felt some of the
bitterness. In the quiet years at
the carpenter's bench, in the lonely
days in the desert, he had bis
doubts and struggles. No trace of
them appears when he stands out
the great teacher of mankind.
"It is the world of song that we
are trying to put into our thanks

giving. Shall we do it for our
country by picking out her tri
imphs and not remembering her
defeats? for ourselves l>y dwelling
on the pleasure and forgetting the
pain? How can we tell triumph
from defeat? Hhall we then rise to
the heroic attitude and offer
thanksgiving for all that has be
fallen us, the evil and the good, the
joy and the sorrow? No, let us be
thankful that joy remains. Not
that there is an alternation of joy
and sorrow, but that joy is perma
nent. After pain there cometh
joy, not in alternation but as the
unsuppressable reality."
