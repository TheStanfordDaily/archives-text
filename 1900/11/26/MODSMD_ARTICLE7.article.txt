# Rooters' Rally.
## 
### 
Last Friday night a rally was
held in the chapel for those who
will occupy rooters' seats at the
game. It was more in the nature
of a song practice and "jolly-up."
Speeches were made by President
Marrack and Veil Leader McCor
mack and it was decided to organ
ize a permanent, rooters, club to
have charge of the yelling. An
other rally will be held tonight.
