NINETY
NINE
people out of a hundred
are looking for a Tooth
Brush that will not shed
its bristles; but they're
hard to find. We've got
a Tooth Brush that we
will guarantee for three
months. If bristles come
out in that time, we'll
replace it with a new
one. Only 25 cents
each. $5 wouldn't buy
a better one.
