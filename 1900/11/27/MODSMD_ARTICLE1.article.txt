# LAST LINE-UP.
## Second Eleven Scores Against the Varsity.—Coach Yost on the Game. 
### 
Last night's football practice
was the last scrimmage work of the
year, and from now on the time
will be spent in running signals
and doing secret work. The line
up was an interesting one last
night and demonstrated efficiently
the fact that our Varsity will not
have a wallc-over in the intercolle
giate game. The second was full
of light and went into the game to
show the first team a few things
about football. The way they
bucked and rushed the Varsity
down the field would indicate that
the "scrubs" did not altogether fail
in their purpose.
The Varsity kicked off to the
second who immediately began a
rapid advance, hammering the
first team's line for the required
distance at every trial. A touch
down was made by the second
without losing the ball, direct from
the kick-off. The Varsity was then
given a chance to redeem itself,
and the second was given the ball
011 the first team's ten-yard line,
while the first team was instructed
to hold. It required only two
bucks to send Parker over for a
touchdown. The ball was then
given to the Varsity to work
up its offensive play, but even
their advancing the ball was
not equal to what their oppo
nents had done earlier in the game.
Twice the second held them on
downs, and it is very probable that
no score would have been to the
credit of the first team if it had
not been for a place-kick by
Traeger from the thirty-five-yard
line, one of the prettiest of the
season.
The Varsity's defense was par
ticularly ragged. Boren, Parker,
and Naramore tore through the
line at will and the Varsity for
wards seemed powerless to stop
their rushes. Gregory, Barnhisel,
and Thompson opened great holes
in the center of the line and played
havoc, with their opponents' de
fense. On the offense, the Varsity
was a trifle stronger.
This state of affairs may he due
to several causes, among them be
ing a strong second team and the
fact that the Varsity was careless
and disposed to take things easily,
it, would be unfair to the first team
to say that they would be careless
in a big contest, but unless they
show vastly superior form in
Thursday's game, the result will
not be a happy one for the Cardi
nal.
The line-up was as follows:
VARSITY. • SECOND.

Coach Yost, when asked today to
express an opinion on the outcome

of the game, stated that any abso
lute prediction would he impossi
ble. "If the team plays football,
hard, fast, and steady, from start
to finish," he said, "we ought to
win. We can win if there are
eleven men in every play and if
each man plays with every ounce
of strength and spirit there is in
him. There will he a hard field,
every hit as fast as the one the
team has played 011 this season,
and altogether the outlook is par
ticularly hopeful."
