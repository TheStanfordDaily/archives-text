Tiie work of the second team is
over for the year, and following
precedent, the Daily Palo Alto
has a few words to say about those
men who have played on it through
the season. Yet it is not the prece
dent which prompts this paper to
praise these men. It is rather a
deep appreciation of their efforts
and a desire to have them know
as a more or less official statement
that the University is with them
in every sense. Perhaps in no
other year has the second eleven
heen so consistently kept down, in no
other year have men on the second
played on doggedly with more of a
foregone conclusion that the \ ar
sity honors were not to he theirs.
We are not making carping criti
cisms on the eve of a victory, hut
we can largely sum up our ideas
on the subject by saying without
equivocation that we would have
no fear of the outcome if the sec
ond team, which has been playing
the Varsity to a standstill, could
go up against the Blue and Gold.
There are men on that team, and
it is not necessary to specify them
to the ordinarily interested and in
telligent. rooter, on whom depend
ence could be placed to play their
position as well as the Varsity
man who has been chosen, and it is
for the sake of giving these men
due meed of praise that this is
written. They have played on
undiscouraged and unembittered
while their friends have told them
that thev should be <>n the team;
that they were better than the man
they were against, and other
things. In the main, the playing
of the men themselves should have
proved that some of the comments,
at least, (were true. But without
bitterness and without revolt these
men have worked on, and at the
end of the season they turn in
their suits, pocket their lonely
"cotnp," and see the other man get

the glory. We are not detracting
from the glory of the big team â€”
there will be many others to at
test to that. We wish only to
humbly extend our gratitude and
praise for the second.
