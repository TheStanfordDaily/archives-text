Herbert C. Hoover, '95, of Tien
Tain, China, who lias been in Lon
don and in other parts of Europe,
lias returned to New York. The
New York Times for November 19th
contains an interview with him on
the crisis in China. He predicts a
great uprising in China and is of
the opinion that the allies will lind
more to contend with than they
ever dreamed of.
In regard to American interests
in China, Hoover said:
"1 had charge of the coal mines
at Chi-Li in the province of Tien
Tsin. These mines are as large
and as valuable as all of the coal
mines of Pennsylvania. They
were transferred by the Chinese
government to American and Eng
lish capitalists. Although the
Americans owned three-quarters of
the mines, they decided to proceed
under the British flag, so that their
property might be protected prop
erly. It is very humiliating for an
American to know that, although
the United States controls 45 per
cent, of the trade of Northern Chi
na, there is not a soldier there to
protect it. Our whole policy has
been to pat a rattlesnake on the
head. Diplomacy with an Asiatic
is of no use. If you are going to
do business with him. you must
begin your talk with a gun in
your hand, and let him know that
you will use it."
