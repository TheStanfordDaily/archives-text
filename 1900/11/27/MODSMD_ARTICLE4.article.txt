# PRAISE FROM YALE.
## "Old Eli" Sends Congratulations to a Stanford Publication. 
### 
Any student activity which
comes in contact with a like one in
another university is in the nature
of an intercollegiate contest. Much
of the care taken in the editing of
the Stanford publications, for in
stance, is due to a desire on the
part of the editors to see that their
papers compare favorably with
those of any college. So far the
Chaparral has been the equal if not
the superior of the papers of its
class in the country, and among
other words of praise that have
come to it is the following greeting
from the Yale Record.
Dear Chappie:
I have just finished looking
through your first three numbers of
this year, and want to send word
across the continent that for hu
mour and artistic excellence they
are the best thing that have "come
out of the West," in the opinion of
the lii-cord board. Your enthusi
asm over your work is apparent
and genuine. Fraternally yours,
F. R. Haight, Manager.
The Thanksgiving Chaparral,
out tomorrow, is not only up to the
regular standard of the paper, but
far above the best that has as yet
been produced. An advance copy
shows the cover design printed in
two colors throughout, in the small
picture as well as the cover proper.
It is printed on white, and makes a
striking design. Inside there are
red initials and red ornamental de
signs, the Varsity "S" being used
with good effect. The first-page
verse is the "Rubaiyat of Over-
Confidence," there is a full-page
drawing by Renaud, and a new
style football story by Larrey Bow
man. In the editorial columns
will lie found two football com
ments and a. prediction, also a
trenchant review of a recent up
heaval in academic circles. "Gar
rulous Ague" has written an ex
purgated song, and the "Knockers'
Klub" tells why we cannot win.
There are three halftone supple
men t,H on extra heavy plate paper,
of the manager, the captain, and
the team. The Chaparral is the
only publication to present a pic
ture of this year's team. On ac
count of the great extra expense of
the issue, single copies will be sold
for twenty-five cents.
