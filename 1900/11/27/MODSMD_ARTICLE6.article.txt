# Second Rooters' Rally.
## 
### 
The second rooters' rally took
place in the chapel last evening.
There was a good attendance, and
the singing and rooting was even
more spirited than at the meeting
last Friday. Several new yells
were tried with good effect.
Yell Leader McCormick called
the meeting to order, and Phil
Oilman led the singing, which was
supported as before by the Band.
The popular songs and yells were
rehearsed, find the committee ap
pointed to arrange organization of
a permanent rooters' club reported.
J. E. Wilson, '01, read the con
stitution, which was enthusiastic
ally adopted. It called for a
secretary, yell leader, and execu
tive committee of five. J. E. Wil
son, '01, was elected secretary; M.
F. McCoi i) ick, '02, yell leader, and
Frank L>> .en, '02, Phil Oilman, '01,
Frank Karr, '02, Chris Bradley,
'01, and C. M. Wardall, '01, on the
executive committee.
The club admits any male stu
dent, and at rallies and student
body affairs members are expected
to take seats on the ground floor of
the Assembly Hall. The move
ment is towards organized and
effective rooting. The club will
appoint linemen for the parade in
San Francisco next Thursday, in
order that the entire line may yell
the same yell and sing the same
song at the same time, and not
have the head of the procession
yelling while the end is singing.
It is becoming apparent, by the
appearance on the quad of men
with rooters' caps, what a fine effect
can be had if every man in the
rooters' section will wear them. As
it is, only about one-third of the
men having seats in the section
have caps. Those who are too late
to get them at the Bookstore can
obtain some in Palo Alto. Every
man should have a cap to make
the device entirely effective.
