The student body can justly feel
tomorrow when the Varsity meets
California's eleven that there will
be eleven men representing the
Cardinal, every one of whom, with
the possible exception of "Babe"
Burnett, is in the pink of condition
and will put up the fight of his
life. Captain Burnett summed up
the situation exactly this afternoon
when he said:
"Jt is impossible to make any
absolute statement about the out
come of the game, but if we do not
win, it will be our own fault. The
men are in the best possible condi
tion, thanks to Dr. Murphy and
"Billy" McLeod. We have had the
best possible coaching from Coach
Yost, who has taught us a vast
amount of football, more even than
we realize. The management has
been all that could be desired, and
Gildersleeve has not left a thing
undone that could help the team
in any way. The support of the
student body has been genuine and
warm. All that remains to be
done, therefore, is for the team to
win the game.
"Although I cannot say any
thing definite as to the result, 1 can
speak for the whole team in this:
We are going to play football for
all that there is in us, and we are
going to play to win if such a thing
is possible. Even if we should
lose, the game will he altogether
different from that of last year, and
Berkeley will have a hard time
putting us under. There never
was a Stanford team that was a
"quitter," and this year's Varsity
has as much spirit as any that
ever has represented us. The hoys
are grit and determination clear
through, and that sort of thing has
won games in the past. While
we are determined and full of spirit,
we are not over-confident. We
know that if we win, we will do it
by the hardest kind of a fight and
by playing the best game there is
in us, and it will not be by a large
score.
"The field is said to he in the
best of shape and as fast as we
could wish for. If it should hap
pen to rain, Berkeley will be as
much affected by the mud as we
will, though of course we want a
dry field if possible. We play bet
ter, comparatively, on hard ground,
however, and naturally wish for
good weather. On the whole, then,
we have as good a lighting chance
to win as we could wish for. It
will be no walk-over, but straight,
hard football, from start to finish,
and if we have our share of good
luck, the finish should not be un
favorable to us."
