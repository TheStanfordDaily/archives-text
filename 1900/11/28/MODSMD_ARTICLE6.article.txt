Tomorrow is the day of the big
game, and everyone is confident of
a victory. This confidence is
based on facts and is natural to
everyone who has watched the de
velopment and progress of the
team. The events of the year have
pointed to a Stanford victory.
The Freshman game was the first
indication and by it we learned
that we have one of the best
coaches we ever had. Yost has
imparted the true football spirit to
his men, and if they play with the
same dash and vim that has char
acterized his coaching, victory is
certain. The management have
done everything possible for the
team, and the student body have
shown that they are behind the
Varsity to a man. The game will
not be a walk-over and no one
should be over-confident. The
team needs the support of every
Stanford man from the beginning
of the game to the blowing of the
last whistle. The spirit of every
"rooter" should be given up to the
winning of the game. The true
Stanford spirit is ''do or die" and
it is this spirit that will give us a
victory.
