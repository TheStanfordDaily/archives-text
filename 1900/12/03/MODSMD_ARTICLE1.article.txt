# STANFORD DEFEATS CALIFORNIA.
## Cardinal Wins From the Blue and Gold by a Score of 5 to 0. 
### 
A place-kick by Traeger, six
minutes before call of time, gave to
the Stanford adherents their cause
for rejoicing on Thanksgiving af
ternoon, after one of the closest
and, at times, most discouraging
games ever played by the two rival
universities. Traeger came to the
rescue of his team-mates and saved
the day for the Cardinal after two
unsuccessful attempts at a goal
from the lield. The steady brace
which the Stanford men showed in
the last fifteen minutes of play,
and which made it possible for
Traeger to score, turned to victory
a tie game which would have been
a victory for the Blue and Gold.
It was this brace which put new
hope in the Stanford end of the
grandstand and made the Cardinal
supporters feel that they were
bound to win.
With perfect football weather
and the field in fairly good condi
tion, it seemed from the beginning
to be Stanford's day, but when the
husky team in Blue and Gold came
upon the field the wise ones began
to look doubt fill.
A cheer went up from the Stan
ford section when Captain Burnett
won the toss and chose the north
goal. More kicked off to Erb, but
the ball was brought back to center
for off-sides. More again kicked to
Erb, who ran the ball in ten yards.
Slaker made two, and then Stan
ford was given ten yards for oft
side play by Clay. In the next
down Clay was ruled off for slug
ging Seeley, a fid Stowe, the Fresh
man guard, took his place. Stan
ford fumbled and California got
the ball.
After repeated fierce line-bucking
California carried the ball to the
twenty-five-yard line, where Mote
made a try for a drip-kick. The
ball fell far short of the goal. Hill
punted fifty-five yards to Gammon.
Smith, Duden, and Gammon car
ried the ball back in short, quick
plunges to the twenty-yard line,
where Stanford for the first time
held on downs. Hill punted
thirty-two yards. California again
worked back to the five-yard line,
but lost on downs. Hill punted
forty yards, More returned thirty
five, N and Raitt fell on the ball on
bis own ten-yard line. Here Raitt,
attempted a. fake kick, but Erb
fumbled and Wotnble fell on the
ball. With but two yards to go
and last down, More attempted a
drop instead of trying to force the
ball over. The ball went wide of
the posts and Hill kicked fifty-five
yards out of danger. More re
turned forty-two yards and Raitt
ran the ball in thirteen, when time
was called for the first half.
During the intermission Cali
fornia was jubilant The light
had been all their own during the
first half and the game seemed al

ready won". Changes were looked
for in the Stanford line-up, but
when the teams came on the Held
it was found that the same men
remained in each team.
Traeger opened the half with a
kick to Pringle, who made thir
teen yards before being downed.
More was forced to kick and sent
the ball forty-two yards into Stan
ford territory. California's ball
on off-side. Stanford held on
downs, Slaker made ten yards
through center, and Hill kicked
fort)' yards. More returned sixty
six yards, the ball going over
Raitt's head and rolling to
the ten-yard line, where he fell
on it.
With a poor pass from Lee, H 1
made a difficult punt of twenty
yards from behind the goal line.
California begun to plunge through
the line, but the gains were short.
Smith took Erb's place at right
half and Ralph MeFadden took
Lee's place at center. The ball
was then on Stanford's fifteen
yard line and More attempted
another drop kick, Tom McFad
den, with the aid of Smith, came
in from the end and blocked the
try. Smith, l)e Forest, and the
two McFaddene were all after the
ball and either would have fallen
011 it. Smith outstripped the bunch
and got the ball near the center of
the Held.
Bansbach here took the place of
Raitt, who was forced to retire on
account of a collision with Gam
mon which made him unconscious.
Here was where Stanford began its
old-time brace in the second half.
Slaker, l)e Forest, Seeley, and
Smith all made good gains of three
and four yards each. Hill kicked
forty yards and More returned
thirty-five. Slaker and Seeley each
made their gains until the ball
rested on the forty-yard line.
Traeger here tried his first place
kick, but it was a poor pass and
the ball fell six yards short.
More punted twenty-two yards
out of bounds. Slaker, Hill, and
Smith carried the ball back to the
twenty-yard line, where Traeger
made a second attempt at a place
kick, but Overall broke through
Hill and blocked the ball.
More kicked thirty yards and
again the ball went out of bounds.
At this time, for the first during
the whole game, all the men 011 the
Stanford eleven got together, and
with short, quick line plunges, and
an end run by Smith of five yards,
the longest of the game, the ball
was soon carried to California's
thirty-yard line. Then Traeger
made his third attempt, and this
time the ball sailed fairly between
tlie posts. The pass from McFad
den was clean and Bansbach held
the ball squarely. All three de
serve credit for the cool and eare

fill manner in which he performed
his part.
With but six minutes left to
play, More kicked off to Cooper,
who made a pretty run in of
twenty yards—the longest run
made during the game. Hill
punted thirty yards. More at
tempted a fake, but was downed
by Tom MeFadden for a loss of
ten yards. More then punted
twenty yards. Ilill returned
thirty. California then attempted
another fake around Cooper's
end, but Worn hie was forced back
for a loss. With the ball in touch
on California's fifty-yard line, time
was called for the end of the game.
A summary of the plays shows
that Stanford had the ball eighty
two times and California had it
one hundred times. Stanford
gained one hundred and forty-nine
yards to one hundred and eighty
four by California, and four hun
dred and fifty-four yards on kicks
to four hundred and seventeen
yards by California, making a total
of yards gained in runs and kicks
by each team of six hundred and
one. Stanford was forced back
eight yards and California twenty
nine. Each team fumbled once.
Stanford was penalized four times,
losing thirty yards. California
was penalized three times, losing
thirty yards. Stanford held 011
downs three times and lost to Cali
fornia twice. The total number of
yards gained throughout the game
was Stanford six hundred and
fifty-seven, California six hundred
and seven.
It would be hard to pick any
men as stars. Tom MeFadden at
left end played the best game at
end, with Cooper a close second.
Womble was not up to his stand
ard and did very little work
worthy of mention. His general
ship was very poor and the score
might have been different if the
team had been handled better.
Raitt's work was not up to ex
pectations as he was hurt early in
the game and was unable to use
his head.
The surprise of the day was the
excellent work of Captain Burnett.
Though he was forced back for
gains early in the game, his knee
soon began to strengthen and then
he put up his usual strong game
both in defense and offense. Cali
fornia tried him repeatedly in the
second half, but each time they
were forced back for loss. Slaker,
too, played under difficulties. In
the second scrimmage his shoulder
was so badly hurt that he could
not use his arm, but he played
throughout the game and carried
the ball and tackled with one arm.
He was always good for two or
three yards at a time and would
have made better gains if he had
had the use of both arms.
Hill's kicking was better than
More's, each kicking fourteen
times, and Hill gaining four
hundred and fifty-four yards to
More's four hundred and seven
teen. Probably the most fortunate
play for Stanford was Hill's punt
from behind the goal line, which

prevented a safely and a score of
2-0 against us.
The umpiring of Ralph Iloag
hmd was the best ever seen in any
intercollegiate practice on this
Coast, and his strict enforcement
of the rules of the game was ap
preciated by all.
With this, the last of the Coast
games, the various teams would
stand ns follows: Stanford, Cali
fornia, Oregon, Reliance, Nevada,
and San Jose Normal. Stanford
has won seven out of eight games
played and has scored one hun
dred and forty-five points to its
opponents, six. California comes
next with five games out of eight,
and fifty-tliiee points to seven for
its opponents. Oregon played
three games, lost one, won one, and
tied the third. Reliance tied Cali
fornia and defeated Nevada. Ne
vada defeated Stanford and tied
San Jose Normal. The latter
team litis lo~i till the games with
the colh , . xcept that with Ne
vada, hu; the strong work put up
by this team shows that they will
be a factor in Coast athletics.
Of the ten years of intercollegi
ate football on the Coast this is
the eighth in which Stanford has
held the cliampionship.
