The lecture by Dr. John Fryer
of the University of California an
nounced for Tuesday evening, De
cember 4th, is postponed until
Thursday evening, December 6th.
Dr. Fryer's subject will be "The
Chinese Problem," a subject which
his long residence in China and
his connection with the educational
system of the empire give him a
peculiar preparation to discuss.
He knows China and the Chinese
problem as probably no other man
does.
