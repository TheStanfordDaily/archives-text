Last Thursday's game, vvitli its
victory, gives back the champion
ship to Stanford, and the chances
are now that it is likely to stay
there for another season. The
Thanksgiving game was a well
earned victory, and a hard fought
one. From the standpoint of the
spectator it was one of the most
thrilling and closely fought con
tests ever witnessed on a Coast
gridiron, and best of all the Varsity
triumphed. Although perhaps
things looked dubious for the first
few minutes, yet the team and the
student body knew that Stanford
was going to win, and there was a
general feeling of confidence among
every Stanford supporter that a
victory could not be denied to the
Cardinal, and they were not disap
pointed. The team was in the
best of condition, and ready to
fight to the last yard. Stanford
had the best team that could be
found, and she is proud of them
and of their showing. To Coach
Yost belongs largely the result. In
him we must feel that Stanford
had one of the best coiiches that
ever came out of the East to devel
op a team. He has lent all his
energy and ability to the building
up of the best team possible, and
whatever he did was for the best
interests of the team. His contag
ious enthusiasm has united both
team and student body as they
have not been in years. Some rec
ognition should also be made to
the management, for we feel that
the present football manager has
spent much conscientious effort in
behalf of the team. The football
squad has received every attention,
and in fact football affairs have
been managed in a careful, syste
matic way. It would not he too
much to say that if future manag
ers would carry on the office under
the methods adopted this year the
results will prove of great benefit.
