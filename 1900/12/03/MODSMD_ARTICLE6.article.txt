### 
The Debating Committee met
this afternoon and completed ar
rangements for the Carnot finals
which are to take place on Decem
ber 15th. The debaters have been
grouped into two squads, both
dealing with the same question:
"Resolved, That the French ad
ministrative law is incompatible
with the spirit of a Democratic
Republic." Those on the first de
bate are: Affirmative, J. F. Eng
lish, '01, E. M. Card, '01; negative,
C. M. Marrack, '01, E. W. Rice,
'02. On the second debate are:
Affirmative, A. N. Merritt, '01, W.
A. Morris, '01; negative, F. B.
Wagner, '03, J. W. Cameron, '03.
Each speaker will have fifteen
minutes divided between two
speeches. No notes are to be used
in the debates and there is to be
no team work. Professors Duni
way, Newcomer, and B. E. Howard
have been selected to act as judges.
The announcement of the ques
tion for the Carnot Debate at this
time comes as a surprise and is ex
plained by the Faculty Committee
as a movement toward a change in
the nature of this debate. This
year it is to be more nearly on the
lines of the Intercollegiate Debate,
while next year it is planned to
make it a purely extemporaneous
affair. After that it is hoped that
some system will have finally been
settled upon which will prove less
objectionable than the system un
der which the Carnot Debate has
been conducted in the past.
