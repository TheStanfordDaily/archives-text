# CALIFORNIA AND STANFORD.
## The 						Athletic History of the Two Universities Compiled by Alumni on Sale Tomorrow. 
### 
Tomorrow there will be on sale
a book on the athletic history of
Stanford and University of Cali
fornia since the time of first inter
collegiate contests. It is written
by Jack F. Sheehan, Stanford, '95,
and Louis Honig, California, ?( .)5,
and is called "The Games of Cali
fornia and Stanford." The book
is on rough paper, legible print,
and bound in gray cloth, with a
cardinal and blue and gold title
design. It contains half-tone
prints of the most famous football,
baseball, and track teams of both
colleges, besides several individual
plates of old-time college heroes.
This is a book that has been
promised for some time, and for a
while at least this athletic history
will be studied with more rapt at
tention than generally compli
ments a chronicler of Greece or
Rome or the middle ages. It is as
full of statistics as a weather bu
reau report, but not nearly so dry
as the latter have been the last few
seasons. The years separating the
present from the first Coast inter
collegiate contests have become too
many to longer allow us to hand
down lore of pioneer days by word
of mouth, and these young men
have got together this information
and placed it in a convenient, per
manent form, where the new stu
dents of both colleges may learn
their a,b,c's, and puff out with the
past glories of their respective uni
versities while awaiting the mak
ing of new ones.
Besides complete scores and sta
tistics, names of athletes, mana
gers, captains, and coaches, a short,
concise, and fair description accom
panies the narration of every con-,
test. This, more than anything
else, takes away the musty odor of
the past and puts life into the
book. The compilers have also in
serted a description of the Carlisle-
California football game and an
account of the longer tours of
tennis of either college. It is a
book throughout calculated to
in a ke for a livelier interest and
harmonious feeling between the
institutions represented.
The book will be on sale on the
quad tomorrow. Those who sub
scribed for copies in advance can
obtain them then. When the first
announcement was made the price
was fixed at one dollar per copy,
but later the compilers decided to
sell it at seventy-five cents per copy.
All those who have subscribed nt
the one dollar rate will only have
to pay the regular price, seventy
five cents.
The edition is limited to five
hundred copies and only two hun
dred of those will be sold at Stan
ford. Already the most of them
have been subscribed for, so that
judging from the advance orders,
all of the books will be disposed of
at tomorrow's sale.
Each purchaser of a copy of the
book will on the firsl of next May
be furnished without extra charge
an addenda containing an ac
count of last Thursday's football
game, and of the results of the

track, field, and baseball contests
between Stanford and California
that will take place next April. It
is the intention of the publishers to
make the book an annual affair,
and each year the book will be is
sued and kept up to date.
