The University Band this year
has made a fine showing. In fact
Stanford has had one of the best
bands in its history. As regards
members and equipment, it will
take rank with any college band.
Its present position is clue in large
measure to the energy and ability
of its leader and manager. Here
tofore the University Band, as an
organization, has always ceased
after Thanksgiving, and in fact
one was organized only for the pur
pose of playing at the Thanksgiv
ing game. However, seeing that
this year's organization has shown
so much ability, it might seem like
a wise plan to endeavor, if possible,
to perfect the organization of a per
manent University Band. There
is surely need for a band the sec
ond semester as well as the first.
On former occasions whenever ral
lies were held, students have been
forced to dispense with the services
of a band or put up with the vol
unteer performance of a band (Mini
posed of a cornet and bass drum.
A good concert band, such as the
present one could soon become if
under the direction of a profession
al leader for a short time, would
soon come to be a regular feature
of our University life. All that is i
necessary is for the student body
to give the members of the Band
some encouragement, and there can
be no doubt that the project can be
carried out successfully.
