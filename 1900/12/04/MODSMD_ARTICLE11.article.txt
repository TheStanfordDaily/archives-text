# College Finances.
## 
### 
According to recent educational
reports there are about 400 colleges
in the United States. The value of
the grounds, buildings, and appa
ratus of these colleges amounts to
$159,000,000 in interest-bearing
funds, from which they derive their
yearly support. There are more
than twenty colleges in the coun
try that have each income-produc
ing property of more than $1,000,-
000. Harvard has more than
$10,000,000 and Yale has about
$5,000,000. Chicago has $8,000,-
000, Cornell $6,000,000, and Johns
Hopkins $3,000,000. Columbia
has a yearly income of $425,000.
Among the other colleges that pos
sess interest-hearing funds of at
least $1,000,000 are Brown, West
ern Reserve, Princeton, Tulane,
YVesleyan, Amherst, and Rochester.
The wealthy universities of Califor
nia, of Michigan, of Wisconsin, and
of Minnesota have each a yearly
income, secured by state legisla
ture, considerably more than the
income of $1,000,000.
Four-fifths of the productive
funds of colleges are invested in
bonds and mortgages. A few col
leges have large amounts invested
in stocks, and a few, such as Har
vard and Columbia, have invested
largely in real estate.
In regard to the expenditure of
these incomes different plans pre
vail at different institutions. In
the University of Michigan two
thirds of the income goes to
instruction and one-third lo ad
ministration. in the University of
California four-fifths goes to in
struction and one-fifth to adminis
tration.
The salary of the better paid
American professors is about
$2,000 and of other professors
$1,500. Two or three colleges pay
a very few of their professors as
much as $6,000. The present ten
dency is toward an increase in the
salaries of professors and a de
crease for instructors.
