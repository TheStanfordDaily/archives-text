# Freshman Glee.

### 
Arrangements for the Freshman
Glee, which will take place next
Friday evening, have been com
pleted. It will be held in Encina
Hall, and the club room will be
tastefully decorated for the oc
casion. Yanke's orchestra of San
Francisco, composed of five pieces,
will furnish the music. The pro
gram will consist of twenty dances,
four extras, and a class grab, if
time permits. There will be no
refreshments, excepting punch,
served.
Tickets have been for the
past few days and are still on sale
at the Bookstore and at Hall's
drugstore, Palo Alto. Programs
may be obtained at either of these
places next Friday. Quite a large
number of students have signified
their intention of attending the
glee, and it should be one of the
most successful social events ever
given at Stanford University.
