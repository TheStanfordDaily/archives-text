# CAMPUS IMPROVEMENTS.
## New House for Sigma Chi.—Other Buildings Under Course of Construction. 
### 
The improvements which have
been under way on and about the
campus during the last year are
many and varied. Few universi
ties will have as complete an equip
ment as Stan fond will have at the
completion of the founders' plans.
These advantages represent an
enormous sum of money when the
cost is to he counted. The build
ing contracts which have been filed
at the office of the County Recorder
show that the total sum runs into
the hundreds of thousands. Be
sides these improvements and
plans, of Mrs. Stanford which are
commensurate with the dignity
and greatness of Stanford Univer
sity, many private contracts have
been let for buildings which will
be an addition to the artistic beauty
of the campus. Notable among
these contracts is*one made by the
local members of the Sigma Chi
fraternity. This contract is for a
chapter house, which will be lo
cated on Lasuen Avenue, between
the Delta Gamma and Kappa
Kappa Gamma lodges. Jt will
add considerably to the beauty
and variety of the architectural
structures on "fraternity row."
The house will be two and a half
stories in height, massive in its
style of architecture, and beautiful
both in its exterior and interior
finish. The ground floor is planned
with a view .toward entertaining.
The large reception hall, living
room, library, and dining room
may be thrown open into one
large room. Back of the library,
which is; on the right of the en
trance, is a smoking and chapter
room.
There are accommodations for
eighteen men on the second and
third floors. The house was to
have been built early in the fall
but the lease of the ground had to
be sent to Europe as Mrs. Stan
ford's signature was necessary.
Thorpe and Lentz of San Fran
cisco are the architects, while R.
C. Andrus of San Jose is the con
tractor. The bare building, as the
papers show, costs $t)028.
But this bv no means represents
the improvements which are to be
made. According to the contracts
filed yesterday, the buildings now
under course of completion will be
finished as soon as possible and
new buildings started. A contract
was let by Mrs. Stanford to Dyer
Brothers for the steel work, cast
iron, and other metal in the audi
torium floor, galleries, and tran
sept and balcony of the Memorial
Chapel, which will cost $5 ( ,»7.5.
This is according to the plan of
Clinton Day, resident architect. In
addition, a contract, was let for the
framing, timbering, carpenter-work,
and the like, of the Memorial
Chapel, to E. A. Hettinger of Palo
Alto, at the price of $34,950. The
plans are also hy Clinton Day.
The contract for the stone work
was let some time ago. The plans
of this building show that it will
be a beautiful structure, and indeed
its appearance in the course of con
struction shows that it will be a

wonderful addition to the campus.
It is on the name magnificent
scale as that mapped out hy the
founders of the University and
presents a picture symmetrical
and of marvelous harmony and
beauty.
