The foothill I season is over and
from the nature of tilings we are
forced to look ahead and anticipate
a victory in all the other intercol
legiate contests for the year. This
is not an impossibility if every
Stanford man will do his part.
Our chances for the intercollegiate
debate are good. In baseball the
outlook is a bright one, for with
the possible exception of the bat
ter}' ever} 7 position is well contest
ed. The possibility of an excep
tionally good showing in track
athletics has never been better, and
if every man trains hard and con
sistently Berkeley will he surprised
on the field-day. The track should
be putin shape at once su that
those who can may begin training.
The department of the gymnasium
lias been very lenient towards out
door athletics, and has allowed all
candidates of baseball and track to
substitute outdoor for indoor exer
cise whenever practicable. We have
an excellent opportunity to make
this a Stanford year, and everyone
should be encouraged to do his
best.
