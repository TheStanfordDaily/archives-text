At the recent convention of the
National League of College Repub
lican Clubs held last month in
Philadelphia, R. P. Cross, '01,
was elected one of the three vice
presidents of the association and
will be at the head of Pacific Coast
district. The honor, coming as it
does to a western man, is no slight
one and is a fitting recognition of
Mr. Cross's services during the re
cent campaign. His election to
the office was a complete surprise
to Mr. Cross, and is therefore more
highly appreciated.
