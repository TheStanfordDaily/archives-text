# Important Change.
## 
### 
The important movement to
wards establishing a definite sys
tem of uniform college entrance ex
aminations has at last begun to
take definite shape. At a meeting
of representatives of the more im
portant colleges and preparatory
schools of the Middle States, held
in Trenton, New Jersey, last spring,
a committee was appointed to con
sider the question of uniform en
trance examinations and to report.
This report has been adopted and
has just been made public. Fif
teen of the colleges of the Middle
States, among them Cornell, have
accepted the report and will put it
into effect next June.
Sometime in June the commis
sion in charge will hold entrance
examinations simultaneously in
about twenty of the principal cities
of the East. The questions asked
will be the same in every case and
the examinations will admit to any
college which has signed the agree
ment. It will cover all the studies
which are required by the colleges
for entrance, and the colleges will
make their requirements identical,
as they have already done in the
case of English.
The advantages of the change
are two. It will enable applicants
to take examinations near home
instead of coming to the college;
and it will facilitate the prepara
tory school work. The colleges of
New England may adopt the ar
rangement also.
