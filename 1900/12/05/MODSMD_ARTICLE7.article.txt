# STANFORD AMENDMENT.
## Complete Returns Show That the Measure Passed by Nearly 70,000 Majority. 
### 
The election returns on the Stan
ford amendment have been very
slow in coming in and not until the
official returns had been sent in at
Sacramento and canvassed by the
Secretary of State could the exact
figures be known. As it is, how
ever, there are two counties yet to
be heard from definitely, Inyo and
Lake counties. No returns have
been received as yet from Inyo
county, and all that could be
known from Lake was that the
amendment was defeated by forty
two votes, the total for and
against not having been received
by Professor Lewers, who has been
collecting the figures ever since
election.
The total vote for the amend
ment as given out by the Secretary
of State is, for the amendment,
137,607, against, 67,737, making
the majority 69,870, which is much
more than was expected at first.
