# NEW QUARTERS.
## The 						Local Branch of the Y.M.C.A. Secures Rooms in the Training House. 
### 
An agreement was entered into
this afternoon by Treasurer Taylor
and Lloyd E. Harter for the Chris
tian Associations, whereby the
Christian Associations have re
ceived the lower front three rooms
ot the training house for a general
headquarters and office.
This has been pending for some
time, as the Christian Associations
have for a long time felt that some
central location was needed for the
Associations, something that would
correspond to the . M. C. A.
buildings in cities and other col
leges. This demand has finally
been met by the securing of the
training house, and the Associa
tions feel that next semester they
will be in a position to do much
more strenuous work here at Stan
ford than heretofore.
The plan of the Associations is
to fit up the rooms at once and
move into them this semester so as
to have everything in readiness for
the opening of the new year.
The rooms secured are the main
hall and the two rooms to the right
and left respectively. The room
on the left, used this semestsr by
the football manager, will be fitted
up as an oflice and will be used as
such by the Y. M. C. A., the Stu
dents' Guild, and possibly the
Sequoia. The Students' Employ
ment Bureau, which has been con
ducted under the management of
the Y. M. C. A., will also have its
office there.
The main hall will be used as a
reception room, and will be fitted
up with rugs, couches, and easy
chairs, making it a cheerful and
inviting place for students to rest
in or meet their friends in.
The parlor will be used as an
auditorium. It is the intention of
the V. M. C. A. to hold here their
regular Tuesday evening meetings
and also the Sunday morning Bi
ble classes. The organ will be in
this room and also the beginnings
of a small library which the Y. M.
C. A. is collecting. It is intended
that these rooms should be public
and open to every student. To
that end the V. M. C. A. will offer
these rooms as a convenient and
comfortable meeting place for all
student body committees or class
committees of any sort. It is de
sired as far as possible to make this
headquarters a. center of student
life at Stanford,and the Y. M.C. A.
will spare no means to attain this
end.
The headquarters will be opened
al once, as the furnishings have been
secured. A house warming and
reception will be given sometime
this month, announcement of which
will be made later.
This movement of the Y. M.C. A.
is in line with the work the Associ
ation has been carrying on for
sometime. For the the past year
the Y. M.C. A. has , conducted a
free reading room in the Camp.
This room has been supplied with
magazines and periodicals and has
been a great success, as well as
filling a long-felt want. This
movement of securing a head

quarters is another step in the
same direction of widening the
sphere of activity of the Associ
ation and is to be watched with
interest.
