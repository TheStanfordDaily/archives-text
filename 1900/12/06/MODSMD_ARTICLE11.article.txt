It seems to lis that a few words
of praise should he given to Coach
Yost, to whom we owe our two
great football victories this year,
lie took hold of our Freshman
squad, which was composed of :t
very mediocre lot of players, and
made a team out of them that was
easily able to defeat Berkeley's ag
gregation of stars. Before the
game every one thought that our
eleven did not have a single chance
of winning, hut the magnificent
team work which Yost had instilled
into it brought a victory to us. He
then proceeded to inspire his en
thusiasm into the Varsity squad,
with like results. We should re
member that the team we defeated
on Thanksgiving day was com
posed largely of veterans who had
played on the teams which had
defeated us by big scores during
the two previous years. Success
has crowned every eleven that he
has coached, and ours were no ex
ceptions. Mr. Yost has been very
conscientious throughout the sea
son, and perfectly fair with every
one. Stanford has never had a
coach who stands higher in its es
timation, or whom it has had more
confidence in.
