# New Book on "Forgery."
## 
### 
Professor Daniel T. Ames has
prepared a valuable work on the
subject of "Forgery." Professor
Ames, who is considered the best
of handwriting in America,
has embodied his experience of
over thirty years in the study of
questioned handwriting in this
work. Professor Ames is of espec
ial interest to Californians at this
time, having come from New York
to testify as an expert in the cele
brated Fair will case and the Hot
kin trial in San Francisco.
The work is literally exhaustive.
More than fifty of the most cele
brated cases, arising on either side
of the Atlantic, and with many of
which the author was connected,
are scientifically analyzed.
One chapter is devoted to the
proposition that experts should be
chosen by the court and not by the
litigants, thus making him a sort
of quasi jury, and something more
than a professional witness. More
than seventy pages are devoted to
illustrations of spurious paper in
all its conceivable forms.
Ths book is valuable both to law
students and practicing attorneys,
and should be a part of every li
brary.
