### 
The Athletic Committee met last
evening with a full attendance. It
was decided to give sweaters with
the German "S" to the following
men: Gregory, Barnhisel, Thomp
son, Harper, Hauverman, Nourse,
YVardall, Pollard, Naramore, Wool
ley, Maples, Bentley, Luck, Emer
son, Nutter, Geissler, Allen, Stan
ford, Butterfield, Crawford, Sprague,
Knight, and Whitlock.
A discussion was raised concern
ing the Varsity cap. During the
present football season many stu
dents purchased the regulation
Varsity cap to wear at the Thanks
giving game and they are still
wearing them on the campus. To
prevent a further infringement of
this rule it vvns decided to change
the style of the cap and to place
an emblem on each one. Football
Manager Gildersleeve was author
ized to procure samples of caps to
be passed upon at the next meeting
of the committee.
