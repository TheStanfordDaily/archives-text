# FOOTBALL MEETING
## R. S. Fisher, '02, Elected Captain for Next Season.â€”Game With Columbia on Christmas Day. 
### 
Ever since the Thanksgiving
game interest has been rife not
only among football men but
among the students generally as to
who the squad would elect for its
next season's captain. The ex
citement was more intense as it
developed that several of the Var
sity were candidates for the po
sition, and it looked to the outsider
like a very pretty fight.. As the
time for the meeting drew near,
however, the fight had narrowed
down to two men who were voted
for at the meeting held in Encina
parlor last night.
The contestants were Ralph S.
Fisher, halfback on the Varsity,
and Frank L. Slaker, fullback.
Fisher was the successful candi
date and was elected by a vote of
thirteen to eight.
Ralph Stephen Fisher, the new
captain,is a member of the Class of
1902 and registers from The Dalles,

Oregon. While his football record
at Stanford is not a long one, it is
a good one. Fisher did not at
tempt to play football until his
sophomore year, making the half
hack position without difficulty.
This season Fisher started out
brilliantly and was doing star
work at halfback when a dislocated
shoulder in the Alumni game Laid
him off for the season.
He is a brother of Forrest S.
Fisher, '99, who was captain of tho
"J8 Varsity and made a brilliant
record as a Varsity player.
Previous to the election it was
decided that in future only those
who have played in tin; Stanford-
California game will be entitled to
a vote for captain.
The matter of a game during the
Christmas vacation was discussed
and it, was finally decided that ne
gotiations should be made if pos
sible looking toward a game with
Columbia in San Francisco on
Christmas day and also one in
Los Angeles on New Year's.
There was some talk of a trip
south for the team and have them
plav the ! os Angeles Athletic Club
on New Year's day, but the major
ity of tin 1 football men are in favor
of the game with Columbia. It
appears that Columbia is anxious

to come to the Coast and it is very
likely that satisfactory arrange
ments can be made.


RALPH S. FISHER, OS.
