# THE 						CHINESE PROBLEM.
## Prof. Fryer of U. C. Delivers a Timely and Able Address on the Oriental Question. 
### 
The postponed lecture on "The
Chinese Problem" delivered hy
Dr. Joli 11 Fryer of the department
of Oriental languages and litera
ture in the University of Califor
nia, was worthy of a much larger
audience than was present in the
chapel last night. Besides being
one of the few profound scholars in
his line of study, Professor Fryer
lias the advantage of having been
for years connected with the educa
tional system of the Empire, and
of understanding, as well as any
white man can understand, the
Chinese people, their character, and
ideals. The hour's talk was a
trenchant and clarifying review of
China's condition, past and pres
ent, and especially of the conditions
attendant on the recent upheaval.
The lecturer began with a sketch
of the dangers which now confront
the Empire, the only escape from
which must be by diplomacy.
"China," he said, "is the unhappi
est of nations. She is beset by re
bellion from within and attacks
from abroad. Her people have but
one thing in common, —an inveter
ate hatred of foreigners. That is
the cause of all the trouble, and if
we consider the indignities to which
the nation has been subjected by
the so-called Christian countries,
who would enforce their religion
and commerce at the bayonet's
point, we must admit that this hat
red is not groundless. For three
hundred years the struggle has
gone on, every year becoming more
and more bitter, until we see the
culmination in the recent terrible
outbreak.
" 'China for Chinese,' say the Or
ientals. 'China for Christ,' say
the missionaries, while the Western
invaders cry, "China for the Great
Powers. 1 And brute force is the
only means used. Reasoning has
never been attempted with the
Chinese. The method has been
one of compulsion from beginning
to end. Missionaries, the precur
sors of the gunboats, have been fol
lowed by merchants, selling the
destructive opium. As a natural
sequence, war has followed war,
and modern warfare is where the
Chinese are weakest. We impose
upon them. It is in this spirit that
the Ilible and opium have gone
hand in hand all over China. It
was the English opium-fields of
India that started the destructive
trade which has assumed such
enormous proportions.
"There are three great obstacles
to the Empire's progress. The
first of these is the vicious incubus
of officials. Full of impossible
theories, avaricious, and constantly
becoming more corrupt, they are
China's greatest foe. Another hin
drance is the chronic state of rebel
lion which threatens the country.
At the present time three separate
troubles are going on, one of which
is a Southern reform movement
which we are liable to hear from
soon.
"Hut the most alarming obstacle
and the hardest problem to solve,
is the increasing use of opium,

which threatens utter ruin if
heroic measures are not adopted.
.Seven or eight out of ten
of city population, and four or
five out of ten of country popula
tion are destroying themselves
with the drug. The Chinese army
is enslaved by it, and even the Im
perial Palace is reeking with its
fumes. This scourge must be re
moved before any other steps can
be taken, but this habit and that
of foot-binding require a strong
government for removal. Educa
tion in Western methods is the on
ly means by which the evil may be
alleviated or wiped out.
"What the next move will be no
one can tell. The problem is too
complex. But of one thing rest
assured. The spirit of reform is
very much alive in the Orient, and
its ultimate triumph is certain.
The whole Empire is writhing un
der its burdens Let the great
powers coiilent themselves with the
strategic points they now occupy,
and com-iilt r it their first duty to
study iiiul *olve the more import
ant fealure> of the 'Chinese Prob
