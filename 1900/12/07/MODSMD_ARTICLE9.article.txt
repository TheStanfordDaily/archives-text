With the election of the football
captain and manager for next year
it can he safely said that prepara
tions are already under way for
another season, which, judging
from the prospects already in sight,
gives promise of heing as successful
as the one just past. We can feel
that football is in the hands of
capable men who will do all in
their power to bring about a suc
cess for Stanford. The dominant
idea should be now that the cham
pionship has been brought hack, to
retain it for another year. Now,
too, if the Columbia game is made
a go, we have a contest on hand
that means much for Stanford. It
would he another of those much
sought after means of affording a
comparison between Eastern and
Western football. And a very good
comparison it would be. Colum
bia's record this year in football
has been a strong one, and if the
Varsity goes up against the Eastern
team on Christmas we can lie as
sured of a hard game. It means
that our team, if they intend to
put up a hard game, must start in
training at once and do some good
work for the next three weeks. If
they do this and go into the game
like they did in the second half of
the game last Thanksgiving, Stan
ford can be assured that her Var
sity will make a very good account
of itself.
