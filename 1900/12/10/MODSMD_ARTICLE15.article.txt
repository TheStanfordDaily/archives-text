### 
—Oberlin lias erected a bulletin
board for the purpose of keeping
the score in sight as well as the
number of downs and number of
yards to be gained.
—W. P. Bates has been elected
captain of the Brown University
football team for next year. He
has been playing fullback on the
eleven for the past three years.
—The athletic board of Am
herst lias voted to assume financial
responsibility for the Amherst in
ter,scholastic meet. The board re
ports a balance in the treasury of
$2,773.84.
—Yale University has organized
a university council, consisting of
representatives of the various de
dartments, for the discussion of
various matters of interest to the
institution.
—At Wesleyan the same system
in selecting men for the mandolin
Club is used as in picking the foot
ball team. Candidates are al
lowed to accompany the club on
its minor trips, and an opportunity
is given them to show their ability.
—Yale will give free tuition to
live Filipinos of exceptional fitness
and high character. They will be
selected by Judge Taft, Yale'7B,
who is head of the Philippine com
mission. This action by the Yale
corporation is the first taken, so
far, but other colleges and univer
sities may co-operate, as the govern
ment is becoming interested in the
matter. American colleges have
before this done good work in this
line. Many of the students sent
over by the Japanese government
have become leaders in Modern
Japan. Harvard's free tuition of
Cubans this summer is also bound
to result in good.
