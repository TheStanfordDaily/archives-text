## The 						Regular Sunday Morning Sermon Given by Professor Burt Estes Howard. 
### 
The regular Sunday sermon was
given in the chapel yesterday
morning by Professor Burt Estes
Howard. His subject, based on
Ist Corinthians iii., 21, was"For
all things are yours." lie said:
"With most thinkers intensity of
conviction is gained at the expense
of breadth of conception. Positive
ness is often the companion of big
otry. It is possible for a man to
be possessed of one idea so thor
oughly that every other idea is ex
cluded. It is not easy to develop
strong personality without at the
same time developing strong preju
dices. A large liberalism with a
good many people is synonymous
with the dissipation of moral and
mental intensity. So then leaders
of thought in themselves are not
bad and creeds in themselves are
not bad. Both may become bad
through a perverted use of them.
When the church insists on using
its confessions and creeds merely
as deeply planted hitching-posts to
which it ties up human thought,
then this thing becomes bad, for it
interferes with the free develop
ment of the soul. The goal to
which humanity is moving must
he a 'Hying goal,' that is, that the
true ideal of human perfection
must be one that is never overtak
en, that the limitless possibilities
of the human spirit demand a pat
tern that is constantly tlying ahead
of the best achievement of men.
Nothing is truer than that the real
ization of one's ideals tends to stag
nation.
"This is not a day for dogma.
When a religious idea has become
a dogma it is because the idea has
spent its force, it is no longer a liv
ing thought. The boasted infalli
bility of each dogma has in turn
yielded to the stress of life's de
mands. The very fact that God
lives and has the power to make
himself known, and that men live
and have the power to interpret
growing revelation, makes it for
ever impossible for any set of men
or for any ag3 to arrogate to them
selves the custodianship of a fixed
deposit of truth.
"It is as the race finds new truth,
adjusts the old facts of life to it,
and modifies its philosophy to fit
the new facts, that the race pro
gresses, that man unfolds. Man is
to be granted the unqualified free
dom of inquiry and appropriation.
Freest room is to be given to inqui
ry as the only principle of progress,
the only secret of security. It is
claimed that such freedom of in
quiry will be utterly antagonistic
toward authority. Why so? It
does not produce any such irrever
ance toward authority in other
realms of reason, it is claimed
that freedom of inquiry puts an
end to belief. Why so? In the
realm of physical science, freedom
of inquiry is the fundamental post
ulate for any certainty of belief.
"Man will never he sure of his
great faiths until he is left abso
lutely free to challenge them. Free
dom of thought is not the end of
thought, but only a means thereto.

The end of thought is conviction,
knowledge, faith.
"We must bear in mind always
that everything in this world of
ours gets its value from its moral
efficiency. Churches, Bibles, creeds,
all derive their right to exist only
because of their moral effect on the
individual and on society. These
things are given for the sake of
man and are never to take prece
dence of the man or to thrust
themselves in the way of his ex
pansion.
"No man has the exclusive mes
sage for all time or even for his
own time. Nor has any sect or
church the right to point to its
creed or confession and say: 'This
and this alone contains the system
of truth that God is trying to teach
the world.' Wherever any man
anywhere or in any age has caught
a glimpse <>112 God or lias heard die
voice of the Divine speaking a
word to the world, his message is
the heritage of the race, it be
longs lo all men. In other words,
the Christian has a right to any
and all truth that comes into the
world. 'Ail things are youi*
whethei l'aul or Apollos or Ce
phas.'"
