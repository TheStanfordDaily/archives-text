# SECOND ELEVEN TO GO SOUTH.
## The 						Faculty Committee Allows the Team to Take a Trip During Christmas Vacation. 
### 
This afternoon the Faculty Ath
letic Committee at their meeting
decided to grant the request of the
second eleven and permit them to
take a trip during the Christmas
vacation.
The question of a trip for the
second eleven has been the subject
of much discussion among the foot
ball squad for some time, and every
one has felt that something should
be done for the scrubs this season
on account of their hard and bril
liant work with the Varsity. Now
all objections are removed and
their trip is assured.
At first the second eleven were
desirous of a trip north to play
Multnomah at Portland and then
on to Seattle and play the Seattle
Athletic Club. However, as the
faculty have prohibited the Varsi
ty from taking their proposed trip
to Los Angeles for Christmas, the
second eleven have decided to go
south to Los Angeles.
Phil Wilson, ex-'Ol, of Los An
geles, Varsity tackle on the '98
team, has been making arrange
ments looking forward to a game
between Stanford and the Los An
geles Athletic Club on Christmas
day, and the second eleven will
play their first game there on that
day.
Arrangements are being made
with San Bernardino for a game in
that town, but nothing satisfactory
lias been concluded, as the Stan
ford management wish a guarantee
and the San Bernardino promoters
have as yet only offered a percent
age, so that nothing has been de
cided on definitely, although there
in no doubt that a game will be
played there. The percentage of
fered is considered sufficiently
large, as a game in San Bernardino
would be sure to draw a big crowd.
The second eleven will play sev
eral other teams, in all probability,
but no definite schedule has been
decided on, as it had been consid
ered advisable to await the decision
of the Faculty Committee before
taking any action in the matter.
Manager Gildersleeve is away in
the city today and nothing defi
nite can be announced as to the
trip until his return, but very
likely about fifteen of the most
prominent seoond eleven men will
be taken on the trip, and they will
leave the University directly after
the close of the semester.
The team will not do much hard
training from now on but will en
deavor as far as possible to keep
in condition for the games. The
one with the Los Angeles Athletic
Club will, no doubt, be the most
difficult, as the (dub's eleven is re
ported to be a rather strong team.
Judging from appearances, the
trip should be a big success, as
Stanford has not sent any athletic
representatives into the southern
part of the State since the Varsity
played the Chicago eleven in Los
Angeles in 1S!)4.
The second eleven has not been
on any trip in several years, the
last one being that of the second
eleven of '98, who were defeated .by

the University of Nevada at Reno
in that year.
The second team is the strong
est Stanford has seen in years and
there is a general feeling of confi
dence that whoever they play they
will give a good account of them
selves.
