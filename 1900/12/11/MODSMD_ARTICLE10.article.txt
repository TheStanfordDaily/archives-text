The Carnot finals take place in
the chapel next Saturday evening.
The student body should turn out
in mass and give our debaters an !
enthusiastic reception. They are
as anxious to be college heroes as |
are our football players, and should
receive even more encouragement.
The many nights they spend pre
paring for debates are not more
than half appreciated. The foot
ball player does his practicing in
the open and receives the encour
agement and support of everyone.
Even if he never makes the Var
sity, his efforts are known and
praised. Jt, is different with the
debater. If he makes the finals he
is in a certain sense a hero, but if
he fails very few students know
that he even tried. Next Saturday
night lot us make a change in this
state of affairs. Instead of the
usual few dozen students that are
in the habit of attending these
events, let us have the chapel
packed with students as would he
the case if it was to be a football
rally. Let us show not only those
who make the team, but also those
who try for it, that they have the
whole student body behind them.
Our debaters cannot be expected to.
do their best it they have to talk to
vacant seats.
