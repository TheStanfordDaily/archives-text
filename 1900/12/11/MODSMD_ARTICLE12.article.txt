# "Quad" Literary Contests.
## 
### 
The prize contest for story and
verse in the li) 02 Annual has been
arranged to extend over vacation
and until January 15, 1901, in
order that students ma)' have the
holidays in which to prepare copy.
Extending the date of closing the
contest this late into the second
semester makes it impossible for
the board to reopen bids, and
hence the editors desire to call
filial attention of those who expect
to compete, to this fact. A prize
of $10 is offered for the best story
of college life, of not over 2,500
words; $10 for the beet poem, and
.$5 for best piece of humorous col
lege verse. A committee consisting
of two members of the faculty and
one student, not on the Annual
board, will decide upon the merits
of the manuscript submitted. The
board retains the right to refuse to
award a prize in case all contribu
tions are judged unworthy the
honor. It also reserves the right
to use any copy submitted in the
contest. All students are earnestly
requested to compete, not only for
the honor of the thing, but to aid
the Quad editors in publishing a
worthy hook.
