The finances of the Thanksgiv
ing game belong more properly to
my December report, as it is im
possible to settle affairs in time to
have them entered in November.
Still, there are certain items in
connection with the finances of the
game which do not really belong in

the published monthly report, and
these J now give here.
The total receipts on Thanksgiv
ing day were $25,195, an increase
oveY hist year's of $4';500, the sales
at the gate alone being two thous
and dollars more. Here at Stan
ford the sales were one thousand
dollars in excess of last year's,
whereas at Berkeley the sales were
over a thousand dollars less than
formerly.
Of this $25,195, the two colleges
netted $20,143.50, or $10,071.75
apiece, the mutual expense being
$5051.50, made up as follows:
I). R.McNeill, construction
of large grandstand.. .$2472 00
Gate-keepers 40 00
Ticket sellers 31 75

Total $5051 50
In addition to the net receipts
from the game, we got $250 from
the souvenir program, the right to
publish which was sold outright
for $500. Stanford's net receipts,
therefore, from the game and sou
venir are $10,321.75, or over $2,000
more than last year; and this is
not a cent too much, as the Train
ing House fund by the amendment
passed last May must receive all
student body assessments collected
(amounting to $630 this semester)
and five per cent of the gross re
ceipts, or about $716.50 (the gross
receipts thus far having been
$14,388), making a total of $1349.50
to be paid into the Training House
fund before the end of this semes
ter, as required by the constitu
tion. The old debts, amounting to
$1275, are being paid off as rapidly
as possible, as well as this year's
bills. After these expenditures
have been made there will be none
too big a surplus at the end of the
year to carry us through next
semester, and I need not point out
the necessity for economy in all
lines of student, body activities in
the next few months, if we are
going to have a surplus at the end
of the year, so as to start the foot
ball season of 1901 on a sound fi
nancial basis. Besides, if there is
a surplus next May, half of it goes
into the Training House fund; the
first fruits of the policy outlined
by the Training House Corporation
last May being now first realized.

The finances of the Thanksgiv
ing game belong more properly to
my December report, as it is im
possible to settle affairs in time to
have them entered in November.
Still, there are certain items in
connection with the finances of the
game which do not really belong in

the published monthly report, and
these J now give here.
The total receipts on Thanksgiv
ing day were $25,195, an increase
oveY hist year's of $4';500, the sales
at the gate alone being two thous
and dollars more. Here at Stan
ford the sales were one thousand
dollars in excess of last year's,
whereas at Berkeley the sales were
over a thousand dollars less than
formerly.
Of this $25,195, the two colleges
netted $20,143.50, or $10,071.75
apiece, the mutual expense being
$5051.50, made up as follows:
I). R.McNeill, construction
of large grandstand.. .$2472 00

Total $5051 50
In addition to the net receipts
from the game, we got $250 from
the souvenir program, the right to
publish which was sold outright
for $500. Stanford's net receipts,
therefore, from the game and sou
venir are $10,321.75, or over $2,000
more than last year; and this is
not a cent too much, as the Train
ing House fund by the amendment
passed last May must receive all
student body assessments collected
(amounting to $630 this semester)
and five per cent of the gross re
ceipts, or about $716.50 (the gross
receipts thus far having been
$14,388), making a total of $1349.50
to be paid into the Training House
fund before the end of this semes
ter, as required by the constitu
tion. The old debts, amounting to
$1275, are being paid off as rapidly
as possible, as well as this year's
bills. After these expenditures
have been made there will be none
too big a surplus at the end of the
year to carry us through next
semester, and I need not point out
the necessity for economy in all
lines of student, body activities in
the next few months, if we are
going to have a surplus at the end
of the year, so as to start the foot
ball season of 1901 on a sound fi
nancial basis. Besides, if there is
a surplus next May, half of it goes
into the Training House fund; the
first fruits of the policy outlined
by the Training House Corporation
last May being now first realized.
