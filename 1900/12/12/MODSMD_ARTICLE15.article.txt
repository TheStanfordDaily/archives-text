With this number the Daily
Palo Alto discontinues publica
tion for the present semester, unci
the editor takes the opportunity of
thanking the members of the staff
and all those who have by their ef
forts aided in the publication of
this paper. Whatever success the
Daily Palo Alto has achieved has
been due to the honest, persevering
efforts of the staff in its behalf.
Their work is in great measure a
labor of love, and too often goes un
appreciated. Former editors have
felt that the University should rec
ognize the work of the staff on the
daily paper, and have tried to have
the staff receive some University
credit in return for the training
they leceive, but as yet it has been
in vain. Still, there can he no
doubt that no one who has worked
on this paper feels that his time
has been wasted, and that the
training given has proven most
valuable. Perhaps in no line of
student activity can the student
reap more real benefit in direct
proportion than in work on the
student publications, and yet very
few realize this, here at Stanford
especially. Our publications, while
very good, yet when compared with
those of other colleges have an un
definable something lacking. There
is a weakness which perhaps is due
to the lack of interest taken in
them by students generally. The
papers struggle along with a sub
scription list so small as to dis
courage am editor and to prevent
him from laying any plans for per
manent improvement and building
up of a good, strong paper. Still,
this paper has a brilliant future
before it, and I he earl}' editors who
laid the present foundations can
feel that their labor has not. been
in vain and that some day all thai
t hey have hoped for and dreamed
of will be realized.
