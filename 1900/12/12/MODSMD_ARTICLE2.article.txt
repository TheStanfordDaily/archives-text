# Intercollegiate Handball.

### 
A communication has been re
ceived from the manager of the
Berkeley Handball Association
looking towards the arrangement,
of iin intercollegiate handball con
test. The Berkeley people are very
desirous of such an arrangement
and Stanford would certainly be
able to put out a strong team.
Handball has become quite pop
ular at .Stanford since it has been
made part of the regulargym work,
and there are some good players in
the University. While no action
has been taken on the communica
tion, steps may be taken later to
arrange for a match.
