### 
The concert in the Assembly
Hall last evening under the di
rection of 11. B. Piismore did not
draw the crowd that has been cus
tomary to attend these popular
mutual evenings. However, this
may he accounted for by the near
ness to the end of the semester,
and the approaching examinations.
Mr. Pasmore is well known at
Stanford, having been organizer
and leader here of the Stanford
Choral Society several years iigo,
and litis always been interested in
promoting Stanford's musical ten
dencies.
The playing of the I'asmore

children is truly charming, es
pecially in the concerted playing.
The most pleasing number of the
evening* was the Haydn trio,
which the children played with
musicianly understanding.
Miss George and Miss Geery also
pleased the audience with their
clear, beautiful tone productions
and the exquisite taste of their
singing.
The evening was most enjoyable
throughout, the only fault being
the length of the program, which
was added to ,by tbe enforced re
sponses to persistent encores.
