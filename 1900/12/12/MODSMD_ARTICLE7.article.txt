# ADDITION TO LIBRARY.
## Complete Set of English Reports Purchased for the Law Department 
### 
Yesterday the University law
library received a valuable ad
dition of some 3,500 volumes.
These were purchased from Minne
apolis parties by Mrs. Stanford at
a cost of about $10,000, some of
the volumes being worth lifty
dollars apiece. This latest ad
dition is a complete set of English
reports from the year 1290 down
to the present time and also a
complete set of Australian and
Canadian reports. Harvard and
Columbia are the only law schools
which possess a more complete set
of these reports.
The law library has grown very
much in the last few years. From two
rooms in Enema Hall, containing
a few volumes, it has developed
until it now occupies the old li
brary building, and is being rap
idly incieased. Within a few years
the Stanford law library will be
one of the very best in the country
and commensurate with the great
ness of the University.
This is the third notable ad
dition within the past few years.
The library was greatly increased
by the gifts of the extensive pri
vate libraries of the late Justice
Field and the late Judge Francis
E. Spencer of San Jose.
The University Library proper
will soon receive complete files of
all the important magazines in the
world. Harper's has already been
purchased, and others will soon
follow.
