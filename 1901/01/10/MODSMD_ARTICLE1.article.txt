# JOHN R. MOTT
## Will Address the Men of the University in the Assembly Hall Tomorrow Evening. 
### 
Mr. John R. Mott, Secretary of
the World's Student Christian Fed
eration, will address the men of
the University in the Assembly
Ilall tomorrow night at 7:30. Stan
ford is very fortunate in being able
to secure Mott's presence at this
time, as he travels much in foreign
lands, working among the different
colleges and universities. He will
speak at only eight American uni
versities besides Stanford during
the present year.
Mr. Mott graduated at Cornell
University in the class of '88at the
age of 23. While there he special
ized in the department of history
and political science, and also in
the department of philosophy. He
was offered a fellowship in each of
these faculties, and was elected a
member of Phi Beta Kappa. He
was largely instrumental in procur
ing for his university during his
undergraduate work one of the finest
college Association buildings in
America.
Upon graduation, the Interna
tional Committee of
Men's Christian Association chose
him to supervise its work among
the universities of North America.
In the capacity of College Secretary
of the International Committee he
has visited practically all the insti
tutions of higher learning through
out the United States and Canada,
many of them several times. It
was during one of his early tours
that he organized the Young Men's
Christian Association at Stanford.
In response to invitations Mr.
Mott has made seven European
tours, visiting universities of all
countries, save Spain and Portu
gal. At the larger universities
of Great Britain —Cambridge, Ox
ford and Edinburgh, Mr. Mott is
looked upon much as the students
of Yale and Harvard looked upon
Henry Drummond after his visit in
1887. During a two years' tour
among the student centers of Eu
rope, Asia, Africa, and Australia
the World's Student Christian Fed
eration was formed chiefly through
his initiative. The objects of the
Federation are: to unite students'
Christian movements throughout
the world; to collect information
regarding the religions of the stu
dents of all lands; to deepen the
spiritual life of students and enlist
students in the work of extending
the kingdom of Christ. The ser
vice of the Federation has been to
make the various student move
ments acquainted with each other,
and also with the vast extent, the
needs, and the possibilities of the
student world. It has organized
seven great national student move
ments where they did not exist,
and established practical means of
communication between the differ
ent movements of all the world, and
by placing the leaders in correspon
dence with each other, by means of
biennial world conferences, the last
of which was held last August in
Versailles —twenty-three countries
being represented.

As an author lie has cultivated
a held of unusual interest and im
portance. Already over twenty
books and magazines have been
written bearing chiellj' upon stu
dent life and student opportunities.
A number of these have been trans
lated into the leading languages of
Europe and Asia. His latest book,
which appeared last September,
entitled ''The Evangelization of the
World in this Generation," is gen
erally conceded to be the most, com
prehensive, live, and reliable book
upon this subject that has appear
ed during the decade. It has pro
voked intense discussion among
scholars and leaders of different
religions. The interest, both in Mr.
Mott's speeches and bis writings is
greatly enhanced by the constant
appeal to facts based upon statis
tics carefully gathered from a
world-wide observation and exper
ience.
Mr. Mott is an impressive
speaker. His style is serious and
somewhat argumentative, but
lighted by profuse and vivid illus
trations drawn almost entirely
from his own experience and ob
servation, and by his warmth and
power of personality.
Mr. Mott stands for the deepen
ing of character. Goodness is not
a thing we accumulate quantita
tively; it is the flavor and perfume
of a good life. A good life is an
active, robust, manly life. There
is no place so favorable for the de
velopment of these qualities as the
university. There is no place
which tries clniracter so severely,
or where shipwreck is more appall
ing. Mr. Mott understands college
men. He knows the diMiculties
and the possibilities in student life.
More than this, he has devoted his
life to a world-wide union of college
men for the most, inspiring crusade
in a thousand years. Whatever
such a crusade may accomplish di
rectly, it must react prodigiously
upon college life everywhere. Stan
ford will be a better University in
every sense of the term if it catches
the spirit of this great movement
and enters into the deepening life
which it promotes. And herein is
the chief significance of Mr. Mott's
visit at, this time. Let everybody
hear him.
MR. MOTT AT YALE.
The visit of John 11. Mott to
Yule, from March 4 to (>, 1900,
resulted in a spiritual awakening
among the students of the universi
ty unparalleled since the visit of
Henry Drummond in 1887. In
deed it is an open question whether
there has ever been a series of ad
dresses more heartily approved by
all classes of men, and more thor
ough going in its results, than this
series of addresses in Dwight Hall.
—Association Record ( Yale).
WHAT DR. JORDAN SAYS.
Dr. Jordan has this to say re
garding Mr. Mott and his work:
"1 have known Mr. Mott for

many years. I consider him a
man of scholarly attainments, of
wide and thorough experience
among university men, thus being
qualified to wisely direct the
thoughts of young men iu the dis
cussion of the great themes of life.
I recommend Mr. Mott's spirit and
method of work as practical and
reasonable."
