# Letter from Dr. Fetter.

Writing to one of the intercolle
giate debaters from Atglen, Pa.,
Professor Frank A. Fetter of the
Economics department takes the
opportunity to drop a good word
for Dr. Curran, who has been ap
pointed to take the place of Dr.
Aid rich as assistant professor of
Economics. He writes: "It is a
most difficult task to take up dis
organized classes, and it would be
quite unjust to judge of his ability
by bis work this semester. There
is no question, however, of his ex
cellent preparation, nor of his nat
ural capacity, earnestness, honesty,
and genial nature. The Univer
sity is most fortunate in securing,
by a happy chance, so capable a
teacher for the present emergency."
He also offers the following ad
vice to the Car not debaters: "I
would advise giving about eleven
minutes to the first speech. It is a
mistake to make the rebuttal too
long. Make the first speech as full
of argument as possible, forcible,
suggestive. But put time —just as
much —on studying the possibili
ties of the four-minute rejoiners.
Make them hot and snappy. Re
member that the kind of quickness
the judges want in rebuttal is
quickness in wit, not quickness in
witticisms. Avoid the temptation
to be personal, sarcastic, or to
crack a joke on your opponent.
Hut if the humor comes in the sit
uation or the absurdity you ex
pose —then it goes admirably.
When practicing with your col
leagues work out al 1 thecombination
of rebuttal you can. We have
learned the lesson, I hope, that
against an agile opponent, a merely
sturdy, solid summing up of the
argument is of no avail. He 'gets
the jump' on you, as the football
men now say. Of course, they
may have no agile speaker —there
were no signs last year that one
would be left over —and then we
can win without a brilliant rebut
tal. Hut it is always safest. I feel
that on this point I have been less
fully assisted than I should. We
always got stalled in preparation
just before corning to the rebuttal."
