# New Student Body Officers.
## 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
student body held its regular week
ly meeting last night. Those pres
ent were M arrack, '01, Cant well,
'01, Morris, '01, Sobey, '01, Gilman,
'01, Raitt, '03. The inroads made
by the Faculty Committee upon
different managers were discussed.
It is quite evident that changes
must be made in the student body
constitution, as the piesent state of
affairs cannot continue much long
er. Various plans for the future
were discussed, but nothing defi
nite will be decided upon until the
faculty is consulted. It has a plan
of its own and in all probability
the students will be forced to adopt
it.
The resignation of 11. H. Taylor
as treasurer was accepted, and res
olutions were adopted thanking
him for his faithful performance of
the duties of his office. The resig
nation takes effect January 17th.
John T. Nourse was elected to suc
ceed him as treasurer. A. B. Lem
mon, '01, was elected business
manager of the Daily Palo Alto;
P. K. Gilman, '01, track manager,
and Frank Lieb, '03, tennis man
ager. The election of a football
manager was postponed, as there is
considerable talk of having a grad
uate manager next year to look af
ter all branches of athletics.
John T. Nourse, the newly elect
ed treasurer, is a member of the
Class of 1900. He has had consid
erable experience in managing stu
dent body finances, which will be
very useful to him in his newly
elected office. He was president of
Jiiuphronia Debating Society dur
ing bis junior year, editor-in-chief
of the Palo Alto during the first
semester of his senior year, and
treasurer of his class during the
second semester. Last term he
was president of the Republican
Club, and be is now president of
