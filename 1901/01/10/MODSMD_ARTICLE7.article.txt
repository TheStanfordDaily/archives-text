The visit of John U. Molt, who
comes on the invitation of the
President as the guest of the Uni
versity, brings to the students of
Stanford a rare opportunity. Mr.
Mott wields, beyond doubt, a wider
influence in the student world to
day than any other one man. His
intellectual power, his strength of
character as a man, his executive
ability manifested in his consum
mate administration of the World's
Christian Student Federation, and
his practical good sense have put
him in a position of leadership in
the college world. It is generally
known among us that he was asked
nine years ago to accept a profes
sorship at Stanford; he has re
ceived similar offers from his own
institution, and he has been sought
for even the presidency of one of
the largest universities of the East.
These overtures and many others
he has felt he must decline for (he
sake of his larger work; for Mr.
Moll's university comprises 65,000
students —men who acknowledge
him ns their leader and head—in
l,f)00 institutions of higher learn
ing in this and other lands. He
has met with and addressed the
students of every great university
in the world, and everywhere be
has been accorded an unusual
hearing by all classes and condi
tions of men of the most varying
social position and the most diver
gent religious views. At Brown
last year eleven-twelfths of the
university heard his addresses. At
Stanford nine years ago practically
the whole University turned out to
hear him. Let all the men of the
University unile in giving a wor
th}' greeting tomorrow evening in
Assembly Hall to this man whom
Stanford has before delighted to
honor.
