# Second Eleven vs. Multnomah.
## 
### 
The second eleven played a tie
game with the Multnomah Athlet
ic Club of Portland on Christmas
day. The game was slow and un
interesting on account of the bad
weather and the muddy condition
of the field. Rain fell all through
the day, and when the teams lined
up a covering of an inch or more of
water was spread over the six inch
es of mud, and as the Stanford
players were unused to a muddy
field, they were unable to run up a
score on the "web-footers."
Before the game Multnomah was
confident of winning, having de
feated last year's Varsity on the
same kind of a lield, but the play
ing of the second was a surprise to
them as well as to the few support
ers of the Cardinal who were out to
wit ness the game.
Multnomah kicked off to Wool
ley. The second took the ball and
carried it back to the ten-yard line,
but were unable to force it over.
Boren, Naramore, and Parker all
advanced the ball whenever called
on, the favorite play being a
straight buck over tackle. Rusk
and Pratt did not do the work
which was expected of them, and
instead of being the strongest, they
were found to be the weakest points
in the Multnomah line.
The Stanford men worked well
together as far as the mud would
permit; Gregory was the only weak
point in the line. He was the only
one of the squad who had failed to
keep training rules, and so was in
no condition for a hard game.
The first half ended with the
ball on Multnomah's twenty-yard
line in Stanford's possession. The
second was merely a repetition of
the first. The club-men at no time
during the entire game had posses
sion of the ball on Stanford's side
of center. The second advanced
repeatedly and seldom lost on
downs, but the offside penalties
were too heavy and prevented a
score in this half.
The men of both teams suffered
severely on account of the cold and
rain. Every time a down was
made they were soaked through
with the cold water and, though
the play was hard and fierce at
times, they were unable to keep
warm. Parker and Slausberry
were both compelled to leave the
jrame in this half on account of
chills, and Wardall gave way to
Maples with a. sprained knee.
The teams lined up as follows:
