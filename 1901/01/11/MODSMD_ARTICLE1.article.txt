This report has been brought
down to this date in order to make
known the exact state of affairs ai
ihe time of my turning over the of
fice to Mr. Nourse, he taking pos
session today. 1 believe it is self
explanatory except as to a few de
tails. The items of the Thanks
giving game were given in my .No
vember report though the proceeds
were not entered till this month.
At the end of the semester all hill*
were paid off for the season, and
also last year's debt of $1275. This
semester, in accordance with Un
constitutional amendment passed
last May, I have paid into the
training house fund $1818.18. This
amendment, it will he remembered,
required all student body assess
ments to be paid in and five per
cent of the gross receipts outside of
assessments The treasurer is re
quired to settle with the fund at
the end of each semester. Last se
mester we collected $631 of assess
ments and our gross receipts other
wise were $ 13,748.67, made up each
month as follows:
September $ 643.48
October 2059.89
November .... 674.05
December 10366.25
Total .., $13,743.67
Five per cent. ( >f this gave us
$687.18 for ihe fund, together with
the $631 collected in assessments,
making a total of $1318.18. This
I have sent to Dr. Angell, the
j treasurer, and its being a trust
fund insures its safety till we are
able to build the training house.
The semester as a whole should
be judged from a financial stand
point only by my balance left for

the new treasurer, as some things
were allowed to run over. Taken
this way it makes, 1 think, a
favorable showing. About $1300
even of debt has been paid and
about the same amount taken out
for the training house fund. This
makes $2600 of expenditures for
the semester, which did not have to
oe paid the first semester of last
year. Despite this our balance at
the end of the semester (January
11) $868.61, over a hundred dollars
more than in December 1899. And
now the appointment of Mr.
Nourse insures the careful manage
ment and skill necessary to leave a
surplus next, May.
The inroads made by the faculty
into our managers' ranks suggest
to me that some change is needed
to the constitution of our Associ
ated Students. It can show but
one thing, and that is that the
time required is too great to per
mit of sufficient study by an un
dergraduate. Stiil we do not at
least ought not, want a graduate
manager system such as ttiey have
at California. There they have
only one man for every department
of athletics and to look after the
finances as well. This gives him
so much to do that in my mind he
can do but little thoroughly. I
suggest that we keep the system we
now have in its essential features,
only giving the treasurer more to
do, having an understanding with
the faculty that he shall not be re
quired to carry University work.
One of the faculty members has
suggested, 1 believe, that we have a
graduate manager who shall be
paid, and some graduate as a treas
urer who shall not be paid and who
shall be a faculty member. 'This
we should not consider for a mo
ment, for we ought never have a
faculty member as a student-body
officer —even though that faculty
member be an alumnus. What we
need to fill such positions are men
independent of the faculty and not
hampered by rulings made known
on occasion; else will we never get
able men to hold our most import
ant positions.
I suggest that we elect our man
agers as at present, only that their
duties be restricted to local man
agement, giving the treasurer (to
be a graduate, as at present) the
making out < 112 schedules and the
buying of all supplies. 'This is
what takes most of the time of
managers now, and if transferred
to the treasurer, he not to be a stu
dent, would so divide the work as
to give undergraduate managers
time for University work, and the
treasurer just about enough work
to keep him comfortably busy.
Besides, it would make one man
entirely responsible for the fi
nances.

Ex-Treasurer.

One of the faculty members has
suggested, 1 believe, that we have a
graduate manager who shall be
paid, and some graduate as a treas
urer who shall not be paid and who
shall be a faculty member. 'This
we should not consider for a mo

faculty member as a student-body
officer —even though that faculty
member be an alumnus. What we
need to fill such positions are men
independent of the faculty and not
hampered by rulings made known
on occasion; else will we never get
able men to hold our most import
ant positions.
I suggest that we elect our man
agers as at present, only that their
duties be restricted to local man
agement, giving the treasurer (to
be a graduate, as at present) the
making out < 112 schedules and the
buying of all supplies. 'This is
what takes most of the time of
managers now, and if transferred
to the treasurer, he not to be a stu

to give undergraduate managers
time for University work, and the
treasurer just about enough work
to keep him comfortably busy.

This report has been brought
down to this date in order to make
known the exact state of affairs ai
ihe time of my turning over the of

session today. 1 believe it is self
explanatory except as to a few de
tails. The items of the Thanks
giving game were given in my .No
vember report though the proceeds
were not entered till this month.
At the end of the semester all hill*
were paid off for the season, and
also last year's debt of $1275. This
semester, in accordance with Un
constitutional amendment passed
last May, I have paid into the
training house fund $1818.18. This
amendment, it will he remembered,
required all student body assess
ments to be paid in and five per
cent of the gross receipts outside of
assessments The treasurer is re
quired to settle with the fund at
the end of each semester. Last se
mester we collected $631 of assess
ments and our gross receipts other
wise were $ 13,748.67, made up each
month as follows:

This report has been brought
down to this date in order to make
known the exact state of affairs ai
ihe time of my turning over the of
fice to Mr. Nourse, he taking pos
session today. 1 believe it is self
explanatory except as to a few de
tails. The items of the Thanks
giving game were given in my .No
vember report though the proceeds
were not entered till this month.
At the end of the semester all hill*
were paid off for the season, and
also last year's debt of $1275. This
semester, in accordance with Un
constitutional amendment passed
last May, I have paid into the
training house fund $1818.18. This
amendment, it will he remembered,
required all student body assess
ments to be paid in and five per
cent of the gross receipts outside of
assessments The treasurer is re
quired to settle with the fund at
the end of each semester. Last se
mester we collected $631 of assess
ments and our gross receipts other
wise were $ 13,748.67, made up each
month as follows:
September $ 643.48
October 2059.89
November .... 674.05
December 10366.25
Total .., $13,743.67
Five per cent. ( >f this gave us
$687.18 for ihe fund, together with
the $631 collected in assessments,
making a total of $1318.18. This
I have sent to Dr. Angell, the
j treasurer, and its being a trust
fund insures its safety till we are
able to build the training house.
The semester as a whole should
be judged from a financial stand
point only by my balance left for

the new treasurer, as some things
were allowed to run over. Taken
this way it makes, 1 think, a
favorable showing. About $1300
even of debt has been paid and
about the same amount taken out
for the training house fund. This
makes $2600 of expenditures for
the semester, which did not have to
oe paid the first semester of last
year. Despite this our balance at
the end of the semester (January
11) $868.61, over a hundred dollars
more than in December 1899. And
now the appointment of Mr.
Nourse insures the careful manage
ment and skill necessary to leave a
surplus next, May.
The inroads made by the faculty
into our managers' ranks suggest
to me that some change is needed
to the constitution of our Associ
ated Students. It can show but
one thing, and that is that the
time required is too great to per
mit of sufficient study by an un
dergraduate. Stiil we do not at
least ought not, want a graduate
manager system such as ttiey have
at California. There they have
only one man for every department
of athletics and to look after the
finances as well. This gives him
so much to do that in my mind he
can do but little thoroughly. I
suggest that we keep the system we
now have in its essential features,
only giving the treasurer more to
do, having an understanding with
the faculty that he shall not be re
quired to carry University work.
One of the faculty members has
suggested, 1 believe, that we have a
graduate manager who shall be
paid, and some graduate as a treas
urer who shall not be paid and who
shall be a faculty member. 'This
we should not consider for a mo
ment, for we ought never have a
faculty member as a student-body
officer —even though that faculty
member be an alumnus. What we
need to fill such positions are men
independent of the faculty and not
hampered by rulings made known
on occasion; else will we never get
able men to hold our most import
ant positions.
I suggest that we elect our man
agers as at present, only that their
duties be restricted to local man
agement, giving the treasurer (to
be a graduate, as at present) the
making out < 112 schedules and the
buying of all supplies. 'This is
what takes most of the time of
managers now, and if transferred
to the treasurer, he not to be a stu
dent, would so divide the work as
to give undergraduate managers
time for University work, and the
treasurer just about enough work
to keep him comfortably busy.
Besides, it would make one man
entirely responsible for the fi
nances.
