# Y.M.C.A. Meeting.

### 
A well attended Y. M. C. A.
meeting last night led by Morris
'01, was addressed by E. T. Colton,
Secretary of the Coast Division.
Mr. Colton, who will assist Mr.
Mott in his work here, isa graduate
of the University of Chicago. He
said in part:
"Mr. Mott is a constant quantity.
Ife will do the same work here that
he did at Harvard and Yale, Cor
nell, Brown, Oxford, Cambridge,
and Edinburgh. Whether the
work is a success or not depends
upon whether or not we support
him well. There is prejudice in
many minds because of the weak
lives of some Christians. Let us by
our example cause no one to stum
ble. Men judge the claims of Jesus
Christ by our lives. One need not,
however, be anxious concerning the
final result of all our work. God
settles everything right in the end.
Let us go out and be friends of
men."
