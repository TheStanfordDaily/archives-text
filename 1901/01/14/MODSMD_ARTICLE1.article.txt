# MR. MOTT'S MEETINGS.
## Large Audiences Turn Out To Hear His Addresses.â€”Last One To Be Given Tonight. 
### 
John R. Mott's first address to
Stanford men in the Assembly Hall
last Friday night was attended by
about seven hundred men,composed
of the faculty and students of the
University. After two hymns, a
solo by Dr. Little, and a short
prayer by the Rev. E. T. Colton,
Mr. Mott began his address on the
subject, "The Battle-ground of Stu
dent Life." He said in part:
"Students are more tempted than
any other class of men, a fact which
is partly due to the sedentary lives
they lead. That is the reason why
i believe in athletics more and
more every year.
"The temptations to which stu
dents are subject, I shall divide into
five classes: the temptation to im
purity, to intemperance, to intel
lectual pride, to hypocrisy, and to
dishonesty.
"The temptation to impurity is
one of the greatest evils that besets
a man. The wages of the sin of
impurity is death to a man's body,
to his mind, to his highest success
in life, to his self-respect, to his
reputation, to his spiritual sense,
and to his soul.
"The man who yields to temp
tation in any of its forms is like a
man in a quicksand. He is lost,
struggle as he may, unless he can
grasp a rock, even though it be but
with his little finger. That rock
which is within the reach of the
least of us, is our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ."
After his address, Mr. Molt went
to the chapel and there talked more
personally with a large part of his
audience, which accompanied him.
He was kept busy interviewing men
until after midnight in the Presi
dent's office.
