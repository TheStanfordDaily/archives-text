Tins visit of John 11. Mott to the
University has fulfilled the expec
tations of the most sanguine. Me
has been welcomed and well re
ceived by the student body, and
his addresses have been attended
by all c.lasses irrespective of their
position in the social or intellectual
scale. His remarks have been ap
plicable to all, and perhaps no
series of addresses has ever been
more heartily approved. When
not occupied with these public ad
dresses, Mr. Mott has furnished op
portunities for personal interviews
in which special questions might
be asked and discussed. He has
had private interviews with over
one hundred men who have taken
a serious and sincere interest in
matters of religion and morality.
These men have had an excellent
opportunity for instruction and en
lighten mont. Mr. Mott presents
his ideas in a simple and a scien
tific manner. He appeals to the
reason and the intellect, but not to
the imagination. His style is
largely argumentative, and his in
tense sincerity and earnestness and
power of personality in conjunction
with (he strong argument and
vivid illustrations he presents,
carry a great deal of conviction.
Many students have been con
vinced by Mr. Mott's arguments,

and undoubtedly all who have
heard him have been influenced to
a greater or less degree for the
good. Stanford has needed such a
spiritual awakening as Mr. Mott
has produced, one which is unpar
alled since his first visit in 1891.
Moreover, the men of the Univer
sity have at this time been brought
into direct touch with the great
Student Federation movement of
the world. The University has
caught the spirit of this movement
for a world-wide union of college
men, which will react upon college
life here as it has reacted upon col
lege life everywhere, and a deeper,
a broader, and a better life should
result here as it has resulted every
where this reaction has begun.
Stanford will be influenced for a
long time to come by this visit of a
man who is the acknowledged chief
of over 65,000 students.
