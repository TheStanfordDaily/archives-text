The student body of the Uni
versity of California has removed a
debt of $5400 which has stood
against it for over two years and
will begin this season with a bal
ance to its credit. The total re
ceipts from the Thanksgiving day
game, which is the one great
money-making item of the foot
ball season, were about $26,000.
The expenses of the game were
$0000, leaving $10,000 for each of
the universities. This exceeded
the receipts of the preceding sea
son by $2000, the proceeds of that
year being $8000, which was soon
swallowed up by the expenses, and
furthermore, added $2000 more to
a debt of $3400. This season, with
only $2000 more of proceeds, Mana
ger Hutchinson has succeeded in
paying all expenses and has
enough left to pay the $5100 debt
and leave about $800 to start this
semester.
