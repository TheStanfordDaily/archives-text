# Talk to the Women.
## 
### 
Mr.Mottspo.ke to the women of the
University, Saturday afternoon at
3 o'clock in the chapel. His sub
ject was "Bible Study." He spoke
of the actual results obtained from
a systematic, daily devotional
study of the Bible. He challenged
any student to spend the first half
hour of every day for one month in
devotionable Bible study, and re
port at the end whether they had
missed the time, or had it inter
fered with their w,ork in any way.
Although hundreds of students had
taken the challenge, he said, their
reports were always of one nature,
namely: that they did not miss the
time, but found on the contrary
that their work was easier.
As a result of Mr. Mott's talk,
about thirty girls have registered
in the Y. W. C. A. for Hil>le study,
six classes being formed. The next
meeting of the V. W. C. A., tomor
row, Jan. 15th, will be in room 23
at 4:30. It will be devoted to this
subject. Miss Florence Hopper,
temporary chairman of Bible
Study Committees, will have charge
of the meeting.
