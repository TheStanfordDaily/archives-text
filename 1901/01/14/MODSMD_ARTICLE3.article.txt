# Mott's Saturday Evening Meeting.
## 
### 
The Saturday evening meeting
was opened by Marrack, '01, who,
iiftev prayer by Professor Milier,

j gave place to Mott. The speaker
I said in part:
"The spirit of earnestness is very
noticeable in this University. Last
night men kept calling on me
away into the watches of the night.
1 shall confine my remarks tonight
to four classes of students. There
are, in the first place, in every uni
versity, men whose lives are con
trolled by a greater power than
their own. Their bodies are their
slaves and not their masters. Then
there are the battling men, who are
honestly trying to get the victory :
over their sin. Then there are the
drifting men, who have fought
and lost. And finally there arei
the beaten men —those who have)
fought and lost —those who are go
ing to pieces. Their bodies are
shattered by physical excesses and j
by the excesses of the mind. They
may seem to be careless <»112 their j
condition, but they are troubled in
wardly.
"llow can the last three classes!
get into the first class? How can
men who are going to pieces be
made whole again? There are!
various saviors—some say heredity;
but that has done its work al
ready. You and 1 are, however,
making it harder or easier for
those to do good who come after us.
"There is another savior—en
vironment; and the present age is
coming to believe more and more
in this. But environment, although
it is powerful, cannot do all. Men
need not so much environment as
the power which will make environ
ment.
"The next power is that of the
human will. It is blasphemous
for men to ask God to do what they
can do themselves. But the human
will is not able to form a perfect
character. God must energize your
will to make you determine to do
right, and then to follow up the
resolve.
"Then there is the real Savior.
These others are absolutely inad
equate. The only true help is in
Jesus Christ. He will break any
man's bond and set him free.
"Conscientious and able men are
coining more and more to believe
in Christ as Lord. There is no one
reason which is influencing stu
dents. One of the many is a care
ful study of His character. Schol
ars have approached Him with
open mind. Other men have taken
the teachings of Jesus Christ and
tested them in the laboratory of
their minds. They have found
that this Man spoke with an
unique authority, and have accept
ed him.
"Others, including myself, have
been forced to believe in Him lie
cause of a careful study of the facts
of the Resurrection. If these are
untrue, history is untrue. Not a
few have believed in Him because
of the death lie died. Place your
life beside that of Christ and you
will be convinced of your guilt.
And no man has ever yielded to
the power of Christ and complied
with the conditions He imposes,
without becoming victorious and
free."
