A larger fuidieneethan the chapel
has cont;tined for some time turned

out yesterday morning to hear Mr.
John R. Mutt. His talk was given
by special request, and was the lirst
during Jus visit which the public at
large has been permitted to hear.
The chapel address took on the
nature of a review Â«>f tlie conditions
<>112 student Christian work, as seen
by Mr. Mott in his recent trip a
arouikl the world. According to the
facts stated, lie has every reason to
be optimistic. Since the beginning
of the student movement at Prince
ton in 1N77, the number of societies
: in this country, Y. M. C. A. and V.
\V. C, A., has increased from 40 to
1050. "Last year," said the speaker,
i "fourteen thousand men were
banded together in voluntary Bible
classes. It is one of the hopeful
signs of the times that .thinking
j men are realizing the importance
jof the sacred writings. 'Never
j since the day of Pentecost,' says an
j eminent college president, 'has such
a rising of young men and women
' been seen.'"
Conditions across the Atlantic,
j according to Mr. Mott, are not so
gratifying. The English univer
sities, despite their crust of conser
vatism, are being penetrated by the
new movement. At Cambridge there
are thirty Bible classes conducted
by the British Christian Union.
It is a striking fact that a large
proportion of these students are con
nected with thescience departments,
"a confirmation," said the speaker,
"ol the fact that if a man employs
rightly the scientific method, and
| is honest with the evidence, Christ
I who is the Truth incarnate will ap
peal to the student seeking sincere
| ly the truth."
Briefly touching upon the work
in Germany where the univer
sities are being slowly weaned from
agnosticism, and in the other
European countries, Mr. Mott
passed on to an outline of progress
in the East.
"India," said he, "has 100,000
students in live great universities.
These men hold the key to the way
India is going to take. As they
and their successors go, so must
go Burma and Bengal and Ceylon.
The progress made in India can be
judged fron the fact that the Uni
versity of Calcutta has from 600 to
700 men attending voluntary Bible
classes, although not 50 of them
are Christians. The plan is to lay
upon the Indians the responsibility
of leading out their own people."
Mr. Mott was impressed by
China and Japan more than other
Eastern countries, especially by
China.
"The Chinese," he said, "are
marked by industry, tenacity,
j physical and intellectual vigor, in
dependence, and conservatism. It
| is the official China that Western
| ers hear about, that went down be
fore the chariot wheels of Japan.
The hope of the nation is in the
new colleges where modern meth
ods are exemplified. The import
ant question is that of leadership
is it to be Christian or agnostic?
Student societies that would put to
shame many of our own are being
formed, the men giving themselves
jto the work with practical intens
! ity. Not one of them has fore-
I sworn his faith even when suffer
-1 ing martyrdom."
