Mr. Mott delivered his third ad
dress to the men of the University
in the chapel Sunday evening. His
subject was, "Shall the Student
Disbelieve or Overcome?" He
said: "Temptations are not sins.
Ihe greatest virtue comes from re
sisting temptation. But yielding
is sin. Everyone is tempted, the
strongest men more severely than
others, Temptations are solitary
and persistent. They cannot be
discouraged; they will come back
time and again. But they are
vincible and can be conquered.
Ihe secret of success lies in resist
ing promptly and earnestly. He
watchful. Christ said: 'Watch
and pray lest ye walk into tempta
tion.' "
