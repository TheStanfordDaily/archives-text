# BASEBALL OUTLOOK.
## Our Hopes Depend Upon the Development of New Material. 
### 
The loss of Strohn, Lougheed,
Hampson, and probably Lanagan
leaves the baseball squad of 1901
in a weakened and almost a crip
pled condition. The gaps made by
the absence of these men from the
diamond can be filled, if at all,
only by the discovery of new ma
terial and by great improvement
in the old. The place left vacant
by Strohn is particularly hard to
fill. Strohn ranks as one of the
best all-around ball players that
ever attended Stanford, being able
to (ill any position on "the team
and do it' well, if Lanagan does
not return to the University hie
loss will be keenly felt, as there
seems to be a lack of pitchers who
can develop into Varsity form.
Lanagan has not as yet decided
definitely whether he will return
or not, but he seems to intimate
that he will not.
Although only live of last year's
team will be back, the positions
will not go begging. The competi
tion for places on the team will be
very keen, there being from two to
six men trying for each place.
The greatest number of candi
dates are trying for the battery po
sitions, and if competition counts
for anything, there will" be some
good work in the box and behind
the bat. Cowden, Knight, Brown,
Slaker, and Thorn have signified
their intentions of entering the con
test for catcher.
Cowden at present seems to be
the strongest candidate for back
stop honors, as he has had more
experience than the others. If for
any reason, however, Cowden
should not make the place behind
the bat, he will be used in the field,
where he played last season.
Brown will also make a strong bid
for one of the infield positions, if
his catching does not come up
to form. Little can be said of Sin
ker as he has not played baseball
since he left preparatory school.
He, however, has the requisites of a
good player and may prove to be a
dark horse. Knight, though lack
ing in experience, is expected to
give a good account of himself with
the mit.
The most difficult task which
confronts the coach is to get a man
who can till the box satisfactorily.
Pomtng, who has quite a reputa
tion as an amateur pitcher, is men
tioned as the strongest man for the
place. He has not, however, as
yet entered the University, but
he has almost made up his mind
to come to Stanford. Pomtag
conies from Salinas where he has
been prominent in baseball circles.
Bennett, who has showed such good
form in the class games during
the last three years, will al
so be a strong candidate.
With practice he should pitch Var
sity brill. Lowenthal, Moore, Stud
ley, and Taylor will also try their
arms at handing out the packages.
Paul Parker, who has perhaps the
strongest arm on the diamond,
woifld also he a strong possibility,
but he wishes to save himself for
the shot-put. lie will try for some

position where he will not hnve to
exert his arm very much.
James Bentley is perhaps in the
lead of those trying for the initial
bag, although he does not move
about with the grace of a finished
ball player, yet lie is a sure fielder
and a good sticker and it is these
qualities which help to win games.
Mitchell, the other candidate for
first base has had considerable ex
perience at Columbia, and may
prove a surprise.
At second base the contest will
he between Brown, Ball, and Mis
ner. Brown has a year's Varsity
experience to his credit, while Min
ner conies highly recommended
from Denver. Ball was a strong
man on the second team last sea
son. Edwards will in all proba
bility play shortstop, but he will
have a close rival in Paul Parker.
Third base will be well guarded.
Connors, the star third baseman
for the last four years on the Santa
Clara team, will doubtless be seen
on the third corner. Connors plays
good, fast ball, and would be a valu
able acquisition to any amateur
team on the Coast. Me knows the
game thoroughly, and is accurate
in fielding, and has a very fast arm.
The only other possibility for third
base would be Chester Murphy, but
on account of his University work
be will not be able to give much of
bis time to baseball. He will prob
ably be used, however, in the Berk
eley games, as bis hitting and field
ing will be of great help to the team.
Murphy covers plenty of ground
and is always towards the top of
the list in the batting averages.
The statement which appeared in
the papers to the affect that Mur
phy was a candidate for baseball
captain is without 112 mndation.
The pressure of University work
makes it impossible for him to ful
fill the duties falling on the captain.
In the outfield (here will be one
open position, Murphy and Sy
monds of last year's team filling the
other two. Synionds is a very fast
man, and can always be depended
upon to gather in all that conies
bis direction. The other field will
probably go to either Lowenthal or
Pollard, although it is yet unknown
bow many men will try for the
place. Lowenthal is a sure fielder
and knows the game well, but he
has not come up to the standard
in stick work. With a little im
provement in bis batting he would
be a strong man. Pollard has
shown good form in fielding and
will be a strong candidate.
From present indications the
team will be strong in the. infield
and outfie'd, while the battery will
be weak. This is exactly opposite
to the condition existing the last
few years, when we had very
strong batteries but erratic fielders.
We have also a, poor aggregation
of batters in comparison with our
teams of previous years. Hitting
will be a very determining factor
in the selection of the team.
Should Lanagan resign the cap
taincy of the team, Harry Edwards
will in all probability be his suc
cessor. Edwards has had two
years' Varsity experience and is
entirely conversant with the needs
of the team. He is now baseball
manager, but will likely resign the

managership if elected to the cap
taincy, as it would be very difficult
for him to perform the iduties of
both. As yet no candidate has
come out to succeed Edwards as
manager.
Swindells, who has been making
such rapid progress toward the top
notch of professional ball players,
lias re-entered the University after
his recent illness. He will assist
in the coaching and will play in
the second team. He will be of es
pecial value to the catchers.
