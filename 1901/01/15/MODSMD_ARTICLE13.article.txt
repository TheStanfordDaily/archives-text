# "James Wobberts, Freshman."

### 
The farce of Richard Walton
Tully of the University of Califor
nia, called " Jamas Wobberts,
Freshman," has met with a varied
success in its presentation in north
ern and southern California. It
has been received very favorably in
most of the places where it has been
played. Some have said that it
was an exceptionally well written
farce, and yet a Los Angeles paper
strongly discredits this opinion.
The company expects to present
the play before a Stanford audience
in the near future and we will then
have a chance to form our own
opinions as to the merits of the
farce.
