The total registration in gym
nasium work is not yet known,
but it promises to be larger than
that of last semester. Over 130
students have registered for the
five to six class and there is a
large waiting list, but owing to the
fact that there is a limited number
of spots on the floor, a few will be
compelled to substitute some other
hour or possibly drop the course
altogether. Because there is such
a large class at the five to six hour
Mr. Storey has made it a rule that
that hour cannot be substituted in
making up cuts.
