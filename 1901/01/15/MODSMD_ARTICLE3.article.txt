Palo Alto called on Dr. Howard
and asked for an interview. • The
professor refused to talk, but gave
a brief statement.
Dr. Howard said: "1 do not
think it wise to make any com
ment on the correspondence al
ready published. The letters are
self-explanatory A further dis
cussion of the matter, on my part,
is likely to do more harm than
good. 1 have made my protest
against a policy of which 1 disap
prove; and must decline to enter
further into the matter."
Dr. Howard leaves three History
courses: eight, the Constitutional
and Political History of the United
States; nine, the history of the
English constitution; and eleven,
the French Revolution. It is re
ported that course eight will be
given by Professor Spencer, nine
by Professor Duniway, while
course eleven will be dropped.
