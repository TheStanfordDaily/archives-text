Dr. N. F. Drake, A. 8., '94, A. M.,
'95, from the Imperial Tientsin
University, writes that "the Ger
man soldiers are quartered in our
university buildings and they have
made a perfect wreck of my chem
ical and assay laboratories and sup
plies. We civilians have found the
military in genenal to be arrogant
and often unjust in their dealings
with innocent Chinese and foreign
civilians."
The London Times lately pub
lished an abstract of the report of
Dr. Drake upon the anthracite coal
fields of China. This was repub
lished by Science in this country.
