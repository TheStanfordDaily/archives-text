# MOTT'S LAST ADDRESS.
## He Exhorts the Students of the University to Come to Christ. 
### 
John 11. Mott delivered his final
address in the chapel last night to
the students (if the University.
His audience filled the chapel al
most to overflowing, and listened
with close attention to Mr. Mott's
earnest and impassioned words.
He said:
"You ought to come to Christ,
and come at once. If you wait
until you have conquered all your
doubts, you will never come.
Work out from your scepticism, if
you are sceptics, by believing first
in Jesus Christ.
"Agnosticism is due to either
superficial, inconclusive, or dishon
est thinking. Von should begin by
believing a few things, and those
with deep convictions. Doubt is
but a transitional state, and from
it you must work into the truth.
"Many students are indifferent
to temptation and many are play
ing with temptation. You cannot
afford to do either. The scientific
method, that is the scriptural one,
is the only way of dealing with it.
Yielding to temptation is sin, and
if will find a man out. lie may
not be found out, but it will find
him out and that is the point. If
a man does not conquer temptation
it will conquer him.
"Let us be men and women of
reality in our prayer life. Many
people are sceptical of the value of
prayer. That is because they d'<
not know how to pray. Again,
we must not show an unwilling
spirit in prayer. Is the truth of
God having light of way in our
daily life? Is prayer more of a
reality to us now than formerly?
It should become increasingly a
fact rather than a form in our
lives.
"Is my life a challenge or a truce?
is what we should all ask ourselves.
Let us above all be men and
women of reality in expanding the
kingdom of Christ in the world. Is
there not a summons to every man
and woman in this country to do
his best in the battle of our Lord?
Why shouldn't you and I tight sin
in all its forms? It never has done
the world any good.
"How may we develop the life of
reality? Let us realize the sinful
ness of a life of hypocrisy, and
fight, as Christ fought, with sin
cerity and earnestness of purpose.
Time is necessary to accomplish
anything in this world, and so is
energy and thought. If we should
all think more and say less, it
would be a good thing. As Emer
son says: 'What you are speaks, so
Ido not know what you are say
ing.'
"A fourth help to students is a
devout, attentive study of the
Scriptures, because they show us
men as they are. They are a
searchlight which reveals the mo
tives and intentions of the heart.
Let a man keep in touch with the
life of Jesus Christ, for he was the
truth. We need Christ, for it was
Hewhosaid: 'If any man thirst
let him come unto me and drink.'
Let us glorify Christ by taking
Him as the king of our lives."
