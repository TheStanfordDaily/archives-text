Abone we print the preliminary
make-up of the staff of the Daily
Palo Alto for this semester.
Changes will be made in it from
time to time as occasion arises. We
intend to work under the theory
that a better paper can be pub
lished by a small and earnest staff
than a large one not deeply inter
ested in the welfare of its publica
tion, and therefore intend having
only workers on the staff. This
may keep it from becoming very
large, but a member of it will be
able to feel that it counts for some
thing U> have his name there. The
success of the paper, therefore, will
depend on the size of the staff, as
everyone of them will have to be
workers.
