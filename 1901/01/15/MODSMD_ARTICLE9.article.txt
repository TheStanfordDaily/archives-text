The musicians of the University
have for some time past shown a
lack of interest in the University
orchestra, which for several weeks
has stopped rehearsing altogether.
A meeting for the purpose of reor
ganization will be held next Wed
nesday evening in the chapel. An
effort will be made this semester to
interest the members in a higher
class of music than heretofore, and
thus secure more intelligent prac
ticing and attain a higher standard
for the orchestra than has yet been
reached.
