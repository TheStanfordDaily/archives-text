# THE
						"CHAPARRAL'S" ANSWER.
## The
						Humorous Paper Appears This Morning with Comments on Dr. Elliott's Article. The Entire Edition Sold. 
### 
The entire edition of the Chapar
ral, containing the answers to O. L.
Elliott's article on "How Can Alma
Mater Wean Her Babies?" was sold
out before the first hour was over
this morning. An additional hun
dred was placed on sale at the be
ginning of the second hour, but all
of them went inside of twenty min
utes. An extra edition has been
ordered and will be on sale on the
quad tomorrow morning, and at
the Bookstore. Orders should be
left with Mr. Hyde, or at room 74
Encina. The articles which caused
so milch comment are not extreme
ly revolutionary in tone, nor do
they touch on any point not al
ready brought out by the Sequoia's
article.
The issue starts with a clever
adaptation or parody of Shak
spere's "Seven Ages of Man," from
which Dr. Elliott took his much
quoted text, "the infant, mewling
and puking." Following this, the
main editorial on "a new dispensa
tion" takes up the cudgel for the
alumni, and says some pertinent
things regarding their treatment by
the University. The best thing in
the paper is the humorous parody
of the Dooley papers, "Mr. Dooley
on a Recent Outburst." Then
comes a long article answering Dr.
Elliott's charges in detail. It is
not altogether convincing, but it
presents the students' side quite
forcibly. "An Infant's Confession"
completes the matter devoted to
Dr. Elliott, and the usual number
of drawings and jokes till up the
best issue that has yet been gotten
out.
