### 
L'rofessor O. P. Jenkins, head of
the Physiology department, has re
turned and resumed his work in
the University, after a six months'
leave of absence. Dr. Jenkins has
spent his vacation in visiting the
different universities of physiology
throughout the United States and
all of the most noted universities
of England, Germany, and France.
A larger part of his time, however,
has heen spent among the schools
of physiology and medicine here at
home. Among the most noted of
these are John Hopkins, Columbia,
Chicago, Philadelphia, and Har
vard. He has made a thorough in
vestigation at all these places of
the methods of instruction and
the facilities for study that each of
fers. While in England, Professor
Jenkins visited the old universities
of Oxford and Cambridge, and
spent some time in London, where
there are a number of excellent
medical schools. From England
he went to Germany and while at
Leipsic, saw Dr. Wood of the Hy
giene department and Professor
Show of the History department,
both of whom are doing special
work in the University at Leipsic.
He traveled considerably through
out Germany, visiting all of its
large and many of the smaller uni
versities, besides many places of
interest to tourists. Most of his
time while in France was spent in
and about Paris, and while there
he visited the famous university of
Sorbonne. Dr. Jenkins has had an
excellent opportunity during this
tour of all the great physiological
universities of the world to note
what is essential and best in a uni
versity course preparatory to the
study of mecicine, and his investi
gations will no doubt influence the
tone and character of the under
graduate work in the Physiology
department to a large degree, al
though this department is already
one of the strongest of the Univer
sity.
