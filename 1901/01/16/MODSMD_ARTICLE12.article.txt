# "A TRIP THROUGH CANADA."
## Professor Fairclough Delivers a Very Interesting Lecture in the Chapel. 
### 
Professor H. It. Fairclough de
livered tiie regular Tuesday night
lecture in the chapel last evening
to a large and appreciative audi
ence. The address was very in
teresting and called forth much
applause at its close.
The lecturer took his audience
on a trip ironi Victoria to Halifax
by way of the Canadian Pacific
Railway, the Great Lakes, and the
St. Lawrence. To this was pre
fixed a short account of the Ca
nadian Confederation and its rela
tions to the Empire, of which it
forms a part. The tic binding
Canada to England, though very
strong from a, sentimental, is very
weak from a government point of
view. Not one cent does Canada
pay in tribute to the mother coun
try, not one cent does she give to
support the army and navy of the
Empire. Like the United States,
Canada is a democracy. Notwith
standing all superficial and purely
local and transient differences, the
two people stand for essentially
the same principles of civilization.
Under either flag you find a gov
ernment by the people and for the
people. You find the same love of
constitutional freedom, the same
liberty of thought and speech, the
same equality for all in the eye
of the law, the same social and
economic problems, the same in
dustrial and intellectual character
istics, the same generous encour
agement of popular education, the
same opportunities afforded to
honest ability of rising from the
ranks.
Commercially, Canada is every
year becoming more important.
Her volume of foreign trade is now
sixty per cent, higher than it was
four years ago, averaging more
than one million dollars a day.
She is one of the best customers of
the United States, ranking close
to France in this respect. The
single state of Pennsylvania has a
larger trade with Canada than the
whole of the United States has
with tin- whole of South America.
Canada was once said to be a
country of length without breadth,
but recent history has shown that
this is not true. Thousands of
people are now living in the Yu
kon, fifteen hundred miles north of
the most southern part of Canada.
At Moose Factory, on .James Bay,
oats and barley, potatoes, peas,
beans, and tomatoes thrive, while
small fruits, such as strawberries,
raspberries, and gooseberries grow
in profusion. The climate here is
less severe than farther south, and
the tempera ture never falls as low as
in Minnesota, Dakota, or Montana.
Canada has now had one-third
of a century of national life. In
that short time her population has
doubled and now she enters upon
the twentieth century with the
brightest, prospects.
The views of the Fraser River
canyon, of the Selkirks and Rocky
Mountains were unusually fine,
and very good, too, were the views
of the Thousand Islands, Montreal,
Quebec, and the Saguenay.
