Although the baseball outlook
at present is not as bright as it
might be, yet there is no cause for
despair, but on the contrary the
realization oft he task before us
should give us an incentive to work
harder. Every man who has had
any baseball experience should
come out, as the first requisite nec
essary for the selection of a victori
ous team is a large number of can
didates from whom to choose.
Even if a man can do no better
than play on the second nine, he
should remember that by so doing
he assists the Varsity both by giv
ing it practice and by making the
men who compose it play harder
ball to hold their positions. Las-t
year over-confidence and loose
playing lost us the series. It rests
with the players this year to re
place these two faults with consist
ency and a determination to win.
A large number of spectators at the
practices, providing no "knocking"
is done, will greatly benefit the
baseball squad, as something must
be done to make the men do their
best in practice, because the inev
itable result of loose practice is
loose playing in the game. No
provision has as yet been made for
the accommodation of the spectators
at the practices on the diamond,
but it is hoped that the manage
ment will soon make some arrange
ment by which bleachers can be
obtained.
