The present trouble affords us an
excellent opportunity not to lose
our heads. Although we deeply
regret Dr. Howard's resignation, 1
do not believe that the question of
free speech is involved in this in
stance. Dr. Howard's utterances
in reference to the dismissal of
Prof. Ross in accordance with Mrs.
Stanford's wishes, while natural,
were impulsive and untimely. At
a crisis which demanded the most
sturdy loyalty, they reflected upon
the integrity of the University
authorities.
My faith in the executive
strength of Dr. Jordan is again
vindicated; without consulting Mrs.
Stanford and yet against his own
personal feeling—as the delay in
dicated—he has followed the only
logical course open to him unless a
retraction were forthcoming. As a
business proposition it would be
absurd for President Jordan to re
tain a professor who has placed
himself on record as bitterly op
posed to the policy of the Univer
sity. If the success of the Univer
sity is to continue the machinery
must run smoothly. Dr. Jordan
has acted on his realization of this
fact. Cecil M. Marrack, '01.
