Practice on the diamond began
in earnest this afternoon. Al
though there was no line-up the
men were kept busy throwing the
ball around and loosening up their
arms. Besides the old men there
was a considerable amount of new
material, but more are needed to
make the practices successful.
At Berkeley the prospects for a
fast team are very good. Berkeley
is very strong this year in the bat
tery positions with Smith behind
the bat and Overall and Nourse at

the slab. Several of the other
members of last year's team have
returned.
The Firemen's Fund team has
been reorganized and will play a
series of games with Stanford and
Berkeley. The personnel of the
team will he the same as that of
last season with the exception of
catcher. Swindells will catch,
while Hammond, who caught hist
season, will he shifted to short
stop. Krug and Moskimon will al
ternate as pitchers. Ffom present
indications it would seem that
both Varsities will have to play
very good ball if they hope to win
against the Firemen.
A .series of games will also be
played with Santa Clara. Santa
Clara has lost a number of her best
men, but she will have, undoubt
edly, a strong team. Kelley and
Graham, who have composed the
battery for Santa Clara for many
years, have entered the professional
ranks.
