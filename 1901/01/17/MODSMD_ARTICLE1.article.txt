# DR. BRANNER SPEAKS.
## He Gives a Statement Clearly Defining the Position of the College Authorities. 
### 
Acting-President Branner gave
the following statement to the
Daily Palo Alto this afternoon:
It vyould appear from many of
the statements heard and seen of
late that the position of this Uni
versity with reference to the con
duct, privileges, and opinions of
members of its faculty is totally
different from that of any other in
stitution in this country. I recog
nize the fact that every one con
nected with or interested in the in
stitution is entitled to know what
principles govern its management.
Permit me to clear away the fog
that seems to have gathered round
the subject and to so state the Uni
versity's position that 1 trust there
can be no possible misunderstand
ing it.
The question at issue in the case
of Professor Howard is simply this:
Are the professors in this institu
tion at liberty to arraign the Uni
versity management in the pres
ence of their classes?
If such a liberty is looked upon as
academic freedom, then I beg to say,
once for all, that such freedom (if
siLch is the word) is not, and will not
be tolerated in this institution so long
as it is under its present manage
ment.
There is nothing new about this
position; it is no new policy; but it
has been assumed from the outset
that every one recognized the utter
impossibility of University exist
ence under any other conditions.
There are here, as there are else
where, proper channels through
which all disagreements can be ad
justed without overstepping the
bounds of official courtesy and pro
priety. When affairs which concern
the faculty or the students either
directly or indirectly, either indi
vidually or collectively, require, or
seem to require, modification of any
kind, it is the duty and the pleas
ure of the President to hear and
consider every complaint and every
suggestion, and every one acquaint
ed with him knows that no man is
more accessible than President
Jordan. J. C. Branner,
Acting President.
