We will publish tomorrow an ar
ticle on track prospects. The outlook
is bright this year for success, but
new men are needed in some of the
events. Dr. Murphy makes an
earnest appeal for men to come
out for the hurdles, distances, and
hammer throw. There are men in
the I!Diversity who have natural
ability for the hurdles who have
not signified their intention of com
ing out, as they have had no ex
perience. This year we have no
veterans in this event, and so must
depend upon new material. Every
man who will take up this branch
of work will not only receive care
ful attention in training, but will
have the gratitude of the Univer
sity. Dr. Murphy is able to de
velop any men with ability for dis
tance running if they will put
themselves under his care. Stan
ford has always been strong in this
department, but she cannot allow
herself to be deceived, as Berkeley
has developed some good men. All
the big men in college who can
should enter the lists for the ham
mer throw. Berkeley has beaten
us in this event every year, and
chiefly because of our lack of inter
est in the game.
