# Tax Exemption Opposed.
## 
### 
An unfortunate outcome of the
present University trouble is the
probable opposition which the Stan
ford tax exemption bill will meet
when it presently comes before the
Assembly. Men who under other
circumstances would freely have
given it their support, are openly
debating the question whether their
vote should be cast the other way
in view of existing conditions. At
present it seems likely that the Uni
versity property proper will he ex
empted without much discussion,
but that the proposed freeing of the
other holdings will meet with sharp
resistance.
