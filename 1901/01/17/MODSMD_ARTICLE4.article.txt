# Proposed Amendment.
## 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
student body held a meeting last
evening. All members were pres
ent. A committee of three, com
posed of Cantwell, Raitt, and
Sobey, was appointed to confer in
regard to the proposed amendment
providing for a change to a gradu
ate manager of athletics. It is
proposed to follow ex-Treasurer
Taylor's, suggestions in regard to
the changes and it is thought the
faculty will concur. Probably the
duties and powers of the treasurer
will be greatly enlarged, but at the
same time he will have under him
a manager for each different ath
letic team. By this arrangement
a great deal of work will be lifted
from the shoulders of the man
agers; they will be enabled to carry
on their studies more satisfactorily
and at the same time give suffi
cient attention to their teams.
Captain Fisher was appointed
acting manager of the football
team to await the action of the
student body in regard to the pro
posed amendment. The meeting
then adjourned.
