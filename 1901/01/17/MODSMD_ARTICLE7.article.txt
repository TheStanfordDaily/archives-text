# AN OPEN LETTER.
## Professor Duniway Sets Forth His Position.—Individual Standards Govern Faculty Action. 
### 
To the students of Stanford Univer
sity:
The present extraordinary con-]
dition of the History department
seems to require some public .state
ment. However unwilling a pro
fessor should he to discuss personal
academic relations in the newspa
pers, it may he useful to depart
from the rule of silence in such an
emergency. Several considerations
deserve categorical notice.
First, The rights of academic
freedom are fundamental in any
university. No self-respecting
man will consent to have this free
dom limited as the price of contin
uance in his university position.
Despite recent events it is still pos
sible for a professor to continue
his connection with Stanford Uni
versity and retain his freedom un
abridged. Cordial assurance is
given that the authorities will fol
low an enlightened policy. On all
proper occasions, and in every
proper manner, the faculty of this
University from the President to
the humblest member, must and
will voice their opinions.
Second, The men who have re
cently resigned from this faculty
are worthy of all honor for devo
tion to convictions of duty. Hut
the difficult and complicated prob
lems at issue present questions for
every individual to solve for him
self. There are many right solu
tions —perhaps as many as there
are individuals to determine them.
The men who remain at their posts
and continue their labors for the
University may be able to serve
the great cause of learning and
freedom just as truly as those who
have chosen to make the strongest
public protest of which they are
capable.
Third, Continuance in official
relations with the University does
not necessarily imply endorsement
of measures of the administration.
Many of the faculty (just how
many, is unknown) believe that
the dismissal of Dr. Ross was an
act of injustice to him and of ser
ious detriment to the best interests
of the University. Many believe,
too, that the forced resignation of
Dr. Howard was another grievous
error. Yet those of us who hold
and express these opinions, and
who still are willing to do our
work, do not feel stultified on that
account. We are using our legiti
mate freedom.
Fourth, There can not be two
opinions as to the great loss suf
fered by the University through
the resignation of Dr. Howard. His
scholarship is most thorough. His
executive capacity has been a pos
itive force, not only in depart
mental matters, but also'in Uni
versity affairs at large. His devo
tion to the interests of his students
has been most unselfish. His en
thusiasm and moral power have
been a tower of strength. His down
right honesty, his warm generosity,
his high sense of honor, are wholly
admirable. His colleagues revere
him as an inspiring leader. His
I students are his disciples and lov

jing friendß. His work, and his
ideals, will live in Stanford Uni
versity long after his departure.
All will yet be well with this Uni
versity, and with the department
;he served so devotedly, if those of
Jus who remain can be true to his
j high purposes.
j Finally, The work of the His
| tory department is not to he aban
doned. Its students, its perserver
| ing members of its faculty, new in
| structors who may come to serve
here,--nil should unite in common
j loyalty for its best interests.
C. A. Duniway.
