# TRACK PROSPECTS.
## A
						List of Those Who Will Train for the Various Events, and the Records of the New Men. 
### 
The outlook for track athletics
this semester is brighter here at
Stanford than it has been since the
opening of the season of' 97. True,
Berkeley has a strong team of well
seasoned men and the trials this
year will surely result in the low
ering of at least four intercollegiate
records, and there is a strong prob
ability that even more of the old
time marks will fall.
Stanford has lost by graduation
only two point winners, Boyd and
Hopper, from last year's team.
As Berkeley loses Hoffman in the
pole-vault and as we gain strong
men in the broad jump, we will
not materially miss the presence
of these two men.
In the sprints we have an array
of good material. Captain Stew
art will train for these events, and
should he reach the form that he
had during last season he will
easily defeat any of his competitors
unless they show improvement.
McCaughern, the winner of last
year's hundred, needs no words of
introduction, more than the mere
mention of his brilliant perform
ance of last year. Harter, a point
winner in last year's hundred, will
â€¢easily eclipse his previous trials, as
he is probably the strongest man
in the sprints, and the most con
sistent trainer on the track. Of
the new men Hamilton, Lamb,
Dunn, and Bubb are the most
promising, and each one has
proved himself worthy of notice by
work done in academic field-days.
For the 440, we have such men
as Smith, Hawley, and Strout of
last year's team, and Dunn,
Lyons, and Kennedy of the Fresh
man Class. Dunn is a Southern
California winner, Lyons had some
experience at Boone's Academy,
while Kennedy has run for two
years in the Santa Clara county
meets. Chadbourne, ot the teams
of '99 and '00, may take up this
event, and should he do so would
prove a stubborn contestant.
Hamilton, '02, Strout, and Chad
bourne need no introduction to
Stanford men as good distance
winners. Of the men who trained
last year but who did not make
the team Ellen wood and Nik irk
are to be especially noted. Nikirk
has good form and with another
season's work will prove a factor.
Ellen wood is a natural distance
man. He did not take up distance
work until late last spring, but in
the short time he trained showed
such improvement as to warrant
the assertion that he will be with
the leaders this year. McLaugh
lin, Adams, and Baker are all fast
enough to be counted in the run
ning, and if Talbot trains faithfully
he may well expect a place in the
quarter or the half. Holman of
Ukiah is the best of the new men
and should do well as he has had
considerable experience in the
A. A. L.
Zschokke and Jones, '02, of the
1900 team will both train for the
walk. These men are hard work
ers, and with Lousley of the '98

team again on the track, this event
will be well cared for. Jones, '04,
will enter this event and from
reports he should make a credit
able showing.
We are weak in the hurdles.
With St rout not trying these we
haveonly Naramore of the old men.
lie showed good form on the hurdles
last year and this season ho will
try the high sticks. Mills,
'01, although he has never tried for
the track team, is a strong man in
this event and should he come out
this year he will be a hard man to
down. Bowman has good form on
the high hurdles and plenty of
speed. A little endurance would
make him a point winner. Copp,
'03, should try this branch of ath
letics, as he has a natural ability
seldom seen. Taylor, a freshman
from Santa Rosa, has had some ex
perience in hurdling and may take
it up here. Nourse, '03, will train
for the hurdles, and though he has
no experience he has good natural
ability. Reed, '03, a creditable
high jumper and sprinter, will try
the hurdles for the tirst time this
year. He should make a strong
man.
We are particularly strong in the
jumps and pole vault. Henley, the
crack Ukiah athlete, will enter all
three of these events. He should
break the records in the two jumps.
In the pole vault Beach, Dole, and
Denton are consistent performers
and will easily make the team.
Beach should win the event this
year if he has fair success in train
ing. In the high jump Dole will
probably be a point winner, judg
ing from his performance at Tan
foran. Bennett, Beach, Palmer, and
Copp of the old men will be out
again. Of the new men who will
train, Preston, Taylor, and Reed are
credited with good records. Nara
more, L3'ons, Symonds, lleed, and
Preston are good men in the broad
jump.
In the weights we have better ma
terial probably than ever before.
Parker,the point winner in the shot
put last year,promises improvement
in form, and lie will be assisted by
Traeger and Brooke. Hyde, a new
man, is a good performer in this
event and will make the old men
hustle to beat him out. Brooke will
throw the hammer, as will Hyde,
Traeger, and McFadden.
