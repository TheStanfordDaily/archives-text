Thk reports which have appeared
in the Han Francisco papers to the
effect that the editors of the Chap
arral are in danger of expulsion,
are, we hope, without foundation.
When the articles which were pub
lished in the last issue of the
Chaparral are stripped of their
comic element, they express as
nearly as any statement could, the
feeling of the whole student body
in regard to Dr. Elliott's Sequoia
article. If a member of the faculty
is justified in publishing his opin
ion of the student body in such
strong terms as employed in the
above mentioned article, we can
see no reason why the student
body is not justified in self-defense
to reply.
