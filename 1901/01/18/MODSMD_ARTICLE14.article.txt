It has been often demonstrated
that a debater, if lie is to stand
any chance of making the team,
must get into harness the moment
he enters college. We want, there
fore, to call the attention of such
new students as are, or would like
to be, interested in such matters,
to the advisability of their joining
the Freshman Debating Society.
One of the features of the new de

bating system is that no first-year
students are allowed in the three
older societies, but to lill the needs
of such students this Freshman or
ganization was started. It is strong
and enthusiastic, but must have
greater support. Membership is
open to both men and women, and
meetings are held on Friday even
ing., unless otherwise announced.
