# NEW WATER SUPPLY.
## A
						Much-Needed Improvement Will Soon Be Made for the University Campus. 
### 
A new water plant is being ar
ranged which will, no doubt, be a
vast improvement over the old
supply from Sears ville. Four
wells will be sunk in the corner of
the arboretum nearest May field.
A sheet-iron structure has lately
been erected there and one well of
the four has already been sunk.
An eight-inch pipe will be used.
The water, which is pumped from
a vein thirty or forty feet below the
surface, is bright and pure. It
will be forced by steam pumps in
to a great reservoir.located on the
knoll back of G. B. Cooksey's resi
dence. The elevation of this hill
is at least one hundred and fifty
feet above that of the University.
The reservoir will be circular in
form and at least one hundred feet
in diameter. Its capacity will be
several millions of gallons and the
water supply from it alone will be
sufficient for University use for
two or three days.
The change has been greatly
needed ever since the University
came into being. The water from
Searsville lake comes directly from
the surface of the earth and is
filled with refuse and earthy mat
ter. Physicians have long de
clared its use to be responsible for
much of the sickness on the cam
pus. The boring and other work
on the wells is being done by
Crichton of San Jose.
