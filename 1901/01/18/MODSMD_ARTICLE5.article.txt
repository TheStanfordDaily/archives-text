# Dr. Jordan's Reception.
## 
### 
At least two-thirds of the student
body was at the depot at 6:08 to
wait upon Dr. Jordan. The "llyer"
was late and the crowd dispersed,
gathering again at 7:00, in equally
large numbers. When Dr. Jordan
arrived nearly an hour later, his
reception was warm and enthusias
tic.
