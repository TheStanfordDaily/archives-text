Petitions containing the following
resolutions were drawn up this
morning and circulated among the
students. About three hundred
signatures were obtained.
To Dr. George Elliott Howard:
Fearing that the action of the
Associated Students in affirming
their faith in President Jordan may
be misunderstood by you, we, as of
those who supported such action,
wish to offer you an explanation.
You will readily realize that we
have been confronted by an ex
tremely delicate situation. On the
one hand, we have had to consider
our duty to the University, and on
the other the rights, convictions,
and unquestioned sincerity of those
members of the faculty concerned,
and the debt we owe them for what
they have given us of themselves
during our association with them.
In reaching our final decision, sim
ply to declare the confidence we
feel in Dr. Jordan, it has seemed
best to us to leave out of considera
tion altogether the merits of the
controversies which have arisen.
We have followed what appeared
the only course fairly open to us as
students and beneficiaries.
We cannot express our regret at
losing you from our faculty. Your
influence has been felt not only by
those of us who have known you
personally, but it has permeated
the whole being of the University.
Upon students the effect of contact

I with you has been that of the idea 1
teacher. The place you h;ive occu
pied iu the lite of the University
cannot he refilled.
