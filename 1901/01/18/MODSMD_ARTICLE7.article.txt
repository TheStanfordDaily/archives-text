A circular containing the follow
ing resolution was started today by
some hot-heads in the History sem
inary:
To Dr. George E. Howard:
We, the undersigned students of
Stanford University, unqualifiedly
indorse the position you have
maintained with regard to the
questions of deep importance which
have recently arisen in this Univer
sity. We sincerely deplore the
forces which have resulted in your
resignation, and we further take
this opportunity of expressing to
you our admiration for the digni
fied attitude which you, and those
of the faculty who have resigned
with you, have maintained through
out the present crisis.
The promoters of the circular
were able to secure only a few
names and so it was soon dropped.
