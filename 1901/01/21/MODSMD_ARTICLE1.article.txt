# DEBATING CHALLENGE
## Nebraska Makes Overtures for an Annual Contest.—Decision Tomorrow. 
### 
A letter has been received from
the University of Nebraska con
taining a challenge to an annual
joint debate between that institu
tion and Stanford. In response to
this communication, Chairman
English has called a meeting of the
debating committee for tomorrow
afternoon. Faculty advisors will
be called in, and the matter will
be settled one way or the other at
this meeting. The letter, which is
self-explanatory, is as follows:
Secretary of Debating Association,
Leland Stanford:
Dear Sir: —The debating associ
ation of Nebraska desires to know
if it is not possible to have a debate
between Stanford and Nebraska
this year. We realize that this is
some distance to travel to hold a
debate, yet that ought not to be
such a difficulty as it might first
seem. We have three debates this
year: with Kansas, Missouri, and
Colorado. It will be almost im
possible for us to have any more
debates here this year. If you can
entertain a Nebraska team at Stan
ford this year, next year Stanford
University can send her debaters
to Lincoln, all expenses to be paid
by Nebraska University. We be
lieve that a debate between Stan
ford and Nebraska Universities
will raise the standard of debating
in the West, and be the big event
in the,two universities in the years
to follow.
We have arranged for a debate
with Minnesota next year, and will
try to get an Eastern debate, and
would like to arrange to have an
annual debate with your people.
If these arrangements are made
they must be made at once, as we
will have to drop one of our de
hates for next year.
Please let us know at once if
such an alliance can be made.
Yours very truly,
B. R. Gordon, Secretary.
