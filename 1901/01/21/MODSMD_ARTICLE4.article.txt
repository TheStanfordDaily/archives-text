## "The World's Missions" Was the Subject of Sunday Morning’s Sermon. 
### 
Mr. CJeorge W. Leavitt in the
chapel yesterday morning spoke on
"The World's Missions," the propa
gation of Christianity, and the
prospects of the complete conver
sion of the world.
"Christian men, individual and
as nations, according to Gladstone,
have no right to enter into commer
cial relations with men and na
tions outside of Christendom unless
they carry with them Christianity
and all its influences. If they do
enter into such relations without
thought of Christianizing, sooner or
later Christianity must be intro
duced by necessity. The Kast In
dia Company of England and its
development will copiously illus
trate. In Japan, after two years
of intercourse with foreign nations,
the introduction of Christianity be
came a necessity and naturally fol
lowed the opening of the harbors to
the world's commerce. And this
propagation of Christianity finds a
justification in the Lord's express
command: 'Go ye into the world
and preach the gospel to every liv
ing creature.'
"Furthermore, for reasons of self
preservation must Christianity be
spread, and for the altruistic mo
tive that induces man to bring to
others the opportunity of enjoying
the benefits he himself has derived.
The love of God, self, and fellow
man, —this is the three-fold justifi
cation for the spread of Christ's
doctrines.
"Although it may seem a prac
tical impossibility, the evangeliza
tion of the world in this genera
tion may be brought about. At
least we will in this generation
give to each man, woman, and
child an opportunity to embrace
Christianity or renounce it. The
real work following the foundation
which has been laid these nineteen
centuries is still to be done. But
to whom and through whom shall
Christ's message go? To the men,
women, and children living now,
and through the Christian men and
women of this generation, because
living people can be reached only
by the living. The examples of
Christ, Paul, and the early Chris
tians, the achievements of the pres
ent church all indicate the possi
bility of marvelous growth of con
version. The work in Manchuria
and Japan has demonstrated this
fact.
"The resources of the Christian
church, both in numbers and
wealth, are sufficient to support all
undertakings necessary. Literal
translations of the Bible in four
hundred tongues make it possible
to reach 1,200,000,000 people. The
young peoples' societies of the
churches and the Sunday school
scholars in Christian lands are
yearly contributing great sums for
foreign missions.
"The student organizations in
this and other lands comprise over
two thousand young men and
women ready to take up the work
of missions.
"Secular interests in the un
christianized lands are aiding the

missionary work, consciously or
unconsciously. Illustrations may
be seen in the opening of Africa
and the Klondike region, and the
taking of the Philippines. Against
all these factors favorable to com
plete christianization of the world
in this generation is the slow pace
of the Christian church in com
parison to that of the Buddhist
and Mormon. There are needed
young men and women to go to
foreign fields and the frontiers to
invest their lives for Christianity;
and a large number of young peo
ple who will stay at home to in
vest their money and resources for
the kingdom of God. A Christian
man or woman is not an owner of
this world's goods, but simply a
trustee. Why should a different
standard of life be asked from
foreign missionaries than from
Christians who stay at home?"
