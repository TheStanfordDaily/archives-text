Tun Debuting Executive Com
mittee has an important question
to settle at its meeting tomorrow
afternoon. Our treatment of Nebras
ka's challenge will affect not merely
our own interests; the entire field
of western debating is involved.
At first thought it may seem wholly
advisable to take up the gauntlet
which Nebraska has thrown at our
feet and to immediately prepare for
the reception of our friends from
beyond the Rockies. But intercol
legiate debates are not matters of
inclination alone. The rights of
the men who will represent us
must be considered. Only those
who have been through the mill of
such a contest as this know how
onerous and exacting are the labors
involved in preparation. Can we
afford to burden our debaters any
further? Js it not best to let two
intercollegiate debates attest our
interest in-forensics for this semes
ter, and leave the consideration of
other arrangements until next
year? These are questions which
can best be settled by the debaters
themselves. Hut it does not ap
pear to us that the matter of fi
nances which has been mentioned
as a possible obstacle is pertinent.
If the debate itself is feasible there
can be little trouble in getting to
gether the dollars necessary to
bring the Nebraskans to the Coast.
