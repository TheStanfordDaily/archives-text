Tiik changes made in the inter
collegiate athletic agreement about
a year ago in as far as it pertains
to football are very distasteful to
the students of both Berkeley and
Stanford Universities. It will be
remembered that it was decided to
have no more Eastern coaches and
to play the intercollegiate games
two weeks before Thanksgiving on
the university campus â€”at Berke
ley next season, and at Stanford
during alternate years thereafter.
Our friends at the University of

California claim that they will not
be able to handle the crowd that
will attend the game this fall and
surely we will not be able to do
any better a year hence. Besides,
both universities will have need of
the proceeds of two or three more
Thanksgiving games. Berkeley
will not be entirely out of debt at
the end of this year, and we will
have need of all the money we can
raise to carry out our plans of hav
ing a training-house and a perma
nent athletic field. We will be the
ones that will suffer from having
graduate coaches. Several gradu
ates from the University of Cali
fornia have been so situated since
graduation that they have been
able to make quite a study of foot
ball, while our alumni have taken
up professions since leaving college
and have spent little of their time
thinking of this game. Ransoine
has been playing with the best
men in the East and is as compe
tent as any man in the country to
coach a team. Kaarsberg and
Hopper coached the elevens of the
Universities of Oregon and Nevada
during the past season. It seems
to us that we have made changes
which we are not able to carry out
at the present time. In a few
years when we have a permanent
athletic field and a larger alumni,
we will be prepared to carry them
into effect, but it would be foolish
to do so now.
