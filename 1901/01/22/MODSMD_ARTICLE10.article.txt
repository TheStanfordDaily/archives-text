# New Ergograph for the Gymnasium.
## 
### 
A new form of ergograph has
been placed temporarily in the h!l>-
oratory of the Encina gymnasium.
This instrument is the property of
Dr. Warren P. Lam bard, professor
of physiology in the University of
Michigan, and was patterned after
the machine devised and used by
Mr. Storey in his experimental
work there last spring and summer.
Dr. Lombard has very generously
loaned this ergograph to Mr. Storey
so that he may be able to carry on
the investigations begun last spring.
This new form of ergograph gives
every promise of being more useful
in experimental work than any of
the older forms now in use. Unless
some serious defects are found, Dr.
Lombard will describe and exhibit
the machine before the Interna
tional Congress of Phrenologists to
be held in France next fall.
An ergograph is a machine with
which experimental work on volun
tary muscular contraction may be
carried on. With it the various in
fluences that affect the powerof vol
untary muscular contraction, mus
cular and nervous fatigue, velocity
of movement, and so on, may be
studied. The advantages of this
new machine are found in the fact
that it works but one muscle, which
is a small one, and which easily
permits the use of electrical stimu
lation.
It is hoped that this new oppor
tunity for experimental work in the
gymnasium laboratory may add to
the old lines of work carried on
there and finally give a greater
knowledge concerning the physio
logical processes that are going on
in the gymnasium every day.
