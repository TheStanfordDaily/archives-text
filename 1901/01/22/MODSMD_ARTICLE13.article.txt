Next Thursday evening will be
given at Assembly Hall the farce
"James Wobberts, Freshman."
The play is written by a Berkeley
man, and the cast is composed al
most entirely of Berkeley students.
The author, Richard Walton Tully,
University of California, '01, is
well and favorably known to Stan
ford people. He has just won the
annual Scott prize offered to Ber
keley students for the best short
story. The company has been tour
ing the State and closes its trip with
the performance here. Wherever
"James Wobberts, Freshman" has
been presented, it has received
flattering notices from public and
press, and we hope that its recep
tion here will be cordial. Each
university should be willing to aid
the other in such praiseworthy
student enterprises.
