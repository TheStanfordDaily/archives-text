A certain class of students in
the University seem to he tilled
with u desire to destroy property.
For some time it has heen the cus
tom for persons visiting the mu
seum to carry away various articles
as souvenirs. To do this it has
heen necessary to deface the statu
ary, and to cut figures from the
inlaid work. Even the teeth have
heen stolen from the skeleton of
"Electioneer." in many instances
the curds used to label the differ
ent pieces have heen stolen, an ir
reparable injury, as at present
there is no other record of the col
lections. The thefts have gone so
far as to almost ruin two of the
expensive Japanese screens, and to
mar some of the finest pieces of
sculpture beyond repair. Visitors
to the museum have from time to
time marked the statues with draw
ings, but these have always been re
moved without material damage.
One day during the last month a
student, as it has bee!) discovered,

defaced (several marble pieces with
an indelible pencil in such a way
that the marks cannot be removed
without injury to the marble. The
authorities state that unless all
such practices are stopped immedi
ately, students will be prohibited
from visiting the museum except
ing on one day in the week, and
then only when accompanied by
some one in charge.
