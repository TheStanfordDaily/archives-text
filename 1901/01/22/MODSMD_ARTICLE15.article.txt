We have considerately refrained
until necessity compels from re
minding the Juniors that a dis
tressingly large number of Quad
assessments remain unpaid. In
previous years a continuous com
plaint has come from the different
managers of laxity in this regard,
and that the Class of 1902 should
have stood off this admonition so
long is a cause for congratulation.
Material for the annual is now
nearly ready for the printer, and
it is absolutely essential that the
manager should have more funds
at his disposal before entering upon
the work of publication. More
over, the plan this year is to in
sert in the book individual por
traits of the entire class, and, as
only the photographs of those
whose dues are paid will be repre
sented, the need of immediate at
tention to this matter is apparent.
As announced in another column,
an opportunity will be given all
delinquents to pay the assess
ments tomorrow.
