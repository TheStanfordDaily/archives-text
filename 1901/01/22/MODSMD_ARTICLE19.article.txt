# A
						Unique Shoe Parlor.
## 
### 
Mr. Felts has opened the most
unique and beautiful little store in
the United States. It is a shoe
parlor arranged according to the
latest designs for the sale of ladies'
shoes exclusively. The furniture
is tasteful and artistic, and in
stead of looking like the ordinary
shoe store it has the appearance of
a private parlor in some home of
taste and refinement. The little
parlor is situated at 926 Market
street, directly opposite the Em
porium, in San Francisco. Mr.
Felts carries a complete stock
of ladies' shoes ranging in price
from $3.50 to $12 a pair.
