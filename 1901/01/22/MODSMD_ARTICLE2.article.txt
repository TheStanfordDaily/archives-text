# The 						Nebraskan Challenge.
## 
### 
The Debating Committee recent
ly received a challenge from the
University of Nebraska for an in

tercollegiate debate this semester.
The committee met this afternoon
to discuss the practicability of such
a debate, but nothing definite was
decided. It was the sentiment of the
meeting to accept the challenge if
the necessary arrangements can be
made. The main difficulty to be
met is a financial one. Stanford
will have to stand all the expenses
for this debate, as it will be held
on our campus. It was calculated
that the total expenses would
amount to four hundred and fifty
or five bundled dollars. About
two hundred dollars of this should
be received aH admission fees, and
there would also be a reduction of
about fifty per cent on the trans
portation expenses. This would
leave about two hundred dollars
either to be raised by subscription
or to be paid by the student body.
Further, our team has two debates
this semester, and it is expecting
too much of them to ask them to
prepare for a third. It was de
cided that our team would insist
upon having the same subject and
the same side of the subject as they
will have in the intercollegiate
debate with Berkeley. If Nebraska
will consent to.this agreement, our
team will probably accept the chal
lenge. And next year the debate
can be held in the fall, so that the
three debates will not come in the
same semester. A letter will be
sent to Nebraska stating the above
conditions and the committees will
meet again in a week to decide
definitely about the matter.
