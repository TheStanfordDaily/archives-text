The Carnot Debate will take
place Friday night, February Bth,
in the Assembly Hall. The ques
tion is: "Resolved, That French
administration law is compatible
with the spirit of a democratic re
public." The debaters for Stanford
are Marrack, Morris, and English,
who represented 1901 in the first
interclass debate two years ago.
The sides and positions will be
known forty-eight hours before the
debate. Professor Lathrop is in
Berkeley today conferring with Pro
fessors Gay ley and Bacon of the
University of California concern

The debate promises to be a close
one this year. The Stanford men
are working hard and earnestly
and will put up a good argument.
The men to represent the Uni
versity of California were chosen
last night. They are W. B. Gree
ley, L. 10. Martin, and J. 11. Stein

the same as will be used at the
