# The
						Queen's Death.

The death of Queen Victoria oc
curred today. The following tele
gram was received in Palo Alto
fifty minutes after the Queen's
death:
"Gowks, Isle of Wight, Janu
ary 22. â€”Queen Victoria died this
evening at 6:45 o'clock, in the
presence of the members of the
royal family."
Thus ends the longest and in
many respects the most important
reign of the English monarchs.
The dead Queen was born in 1819
and ascended the throne on the
death of King William IV, June
20, 1837.
The Privy Council will in all
probability meet tomorrow and de
clare the Prince of Wales King of
England.
