# TOMORROW NIGHT'S FARCE.
## List of Characters and Brief Synopsis of the Play. 
### 
"James Wobberts, Freshman,"
which is to he presented tomorow
evening at the Assembly Hall, has
a distinctively collegiate setting for
its plot; and more than that it, has
characters drawn entirely from our
two local universities. The story
is unique and interesting.
Tom Harrington, captain of the
Berkeley football team, has, with
his chum Reginald Black, been en
joying life one fine evening in San
Francisco. They return to Berke
ley next morning to Mrs. Wiggins'
boarding house, and learn that
Tom's father is going to visit Berke
ley that very day to see how well
his boy has been doing. Just after
they have found this out, the father
and his daughter arrive. Tom's
work in college has been such that
lie has no friendly professors and
in his distress he and Regie bluff a
freshman, ''James Wobberts" into
playing the part of a professor.
They introduce him as Professor
James, that professor who has
lately resigned from Stanford and
been elected to the head of the
mathematics department at Berke
ley. Professor James unexpectedly
arrives and the boys are compelled
to persuade this very nervous indi
vidual that Tom is a member of the
faculty who has been delegated
to initiate Professor James into
the faculty secret society. His ex
perience is truly thrilling as he
rides the goat. Besides this main
plot there are several good sub
plots, introducing the miner from
the hills who "asks for whiskey
and gets a widder," the "Jap,''
Marian Davenant, and Ruth
Thornton.
In an interview today Manager
Thomas said: "That this farce is
clever cannot be doubted, for al
ready it has been contracted for
professionally, and within thirty
days will tour for the East with
a professional cast. The Univer
sity of California never expects to
see another junior farce one-half
as clever, and I do not expect to
see a professional cast that can
better interpret 'James Wobberts'
than can the present."
