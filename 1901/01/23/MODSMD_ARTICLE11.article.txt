### 
The Christian Association recep
tion to Freshmen, to he held next
Friday evening in Encina club
room, promises to he the most en
joyable ever given by that body.
The program, which, it is hoped,
will not interfere in the least with
the social part of the affair, will he
short but enjoyable. It will con
sist in part of selections by the
Mandolin and Glee Clubs, and a
few choice selections by the Re
Lagunita trio. An original feature
of the evening will be a tragedy in
silhouette, a warning to "queeners."
The victims who will participate in
this have not yet been selected. Re
freshments will be served.
