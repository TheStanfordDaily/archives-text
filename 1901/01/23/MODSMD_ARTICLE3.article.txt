# Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
The recent rain has interfered
considerably with the work on the
diamond, but a fairly large number
of men were out to practice last
night. Brown, Cowden, Symonds,
and Edwards of last year's team
are showing good form. Knight is
showing up very well and puts
more dash and spirit into his play
than any one on the held. Traeger
and Mitchell made their first ap
pearance at practice and promise
to make a hard fight for first base.
Misner is perhaps leading the new
men, but it is yet too early to judge
the new material. Palmtag was an
interested spectator at the last
practice and expects to be out in
his suit very soon.
The Executive Committee will
elect a manager this evening to fill
the vacancy created by the resig
nation of Edwards. L. Ferrari,'ol,
and Eugene Warren, '01, are out
for the position.
