It is a notable fact that the men
who have been chosen to represent
us in the Carnot debate this year
are the same three who, two years
ago, composed the Sophomore
Class team. This of course does
not go to show that interclass de
baters invariably make the inter
collegiate teams, but it does prove
that the men who take an interest
in debating in the early years of
their college life are the ones up
on whom, when they become up
per-classmen, the*UDiversity must
largely depend for her Varsity ma
terial. The Freshman, therefore,
who has any talent whatever in
this line, should not hesitate to
put himself forward and, by getting
all the practice possible out of
class debates, strengthen both him
self and his University for the
years to come.
