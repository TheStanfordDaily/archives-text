Testimonial to Dr. George Elliott
Howard.
In view of your departure, we,
students in the Historical Semi
nar}', desire to express our appre
ciation of your services to us as a
teacher and leader.
We recognize your profound
scholarship and your great execu
tive ability: an ability emphasized
by the thorough and complete or
ganization of the History depart
ment, by the ease and strength
with which you have directed its
affairs, and by the frequent de
mands made upon you for counsel
and advice in the general manage
ment of the University.
The manner in which you have
carried forward your work, and the
inspiration which you have given
to your students, mark you as a
great teacher. The increasing suc
cess of your students as teachers of
history makes plain that they
have sot at the feet of a master;
and their regard for you is ex
celled only by their devotion to the
truth into which you have led
them.
We admire the spirit which has
led you, for the sake of your stu
dents and the University, to make
many sacrifices. We thank you
for the generosity which has given
us the unrestricted use of your li
brary. We are touched by your
devotion to our welfare made evi
dent by keeping up your work
faithfully to the last, in circum
stances which rob labor of its zest.
Our abiding faith in you has
been begotten by your high charac
ter, by the unselfish interest in us
which you have always shown, and
by your absolute devotion to the
truth.
You have proved that a teacher
may hold close personal relations
with his students without any loss
of his dignity and with a great
gain of their love.
We deplore the loss which the
University has sustained; but we
know that your resignation cannot
break the ties which bind you to
your students.
[Signed by Seminary students.]

We deplore the unfortunate cir
cumstances which have led you to
leave us.
YVe honor you for the nobility
of character which has made you
give up your position for what you

We believe that the sacrifice you
have made will help to protect that
liberty of thought and freedom of
speech which are so dear to every

We part from you feeling our
great loss, and wish it might not
have been so.
