The intercollegiate committee of
California and Stanford will meet
in joint session at the Palace hotel
in San Francisco next Saturday
afternoon at one o'clock to confer
011 the existing athletic agreement
between the two colleges. The
committee appointed by Cali
fornia consists of Graduate
Manager Reno, Ralph S. Fisher,
Everett J. Brown. Stanford
is to be represented by F. L.
Berry, '99, 1). E. Brown, '97, and
C. A. Cantwell, '01. Amendments
to the present instrument are ex
pected from both committees.
California will probably ask that
rowing be added to the list of in
tercollegiate sports and that the
definition of an amateur bechanged
to conform to the latest rules. The
committee will also propose to
strike out that clause in the agree
ment which prescribes that after
1900 all intercollegiate contests
shall be held on the col lege grounds.
Stanford desires to have the
mile walk discarded as an event in
the track meets, but, out of court
esy to Walsh, captain of the Uni
versity of California's team, the
amendment will not be proposed.
