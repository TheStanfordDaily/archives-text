This year we are confronted with
the problem of building up a base
ball team of almost entirely new
material. With the Class of 1900
a number of men entered who iiave
borne the brunt of our baseball
games up to the present year.
These men have left us and we
have few veterans to depend upon.
A change is needed in the baseball
policy. No inducement is given to
the men who are not good enough
to make the Varsity. They play
throughout the season, and the
student body does not furnish even
shoes or jerseys. As a consequence
of this system some good men re
fuse to remain on the Held unless
confident of making the team. At
the end of the year, usually only
enough players are out to make up
the second team, and these men
play in a listless manner, for they
realize that the}' will receive no
reward. If :i sweater was given to
second team men, or if they were
even furnished with suitable uni
forms, the competition would lie
come keener and material would
be developed upon which we could
depend to win games in the years
to come.
