THio cross-country run in a feat
ure of college athletics which Stan
ford has hitherto unduly neglected,
but which, now that it is intro
duced, should receive our heartiest
approbation. For some years the
Eastern universities have allotted
to cross-country running a promi
nent place in their athletics, while
the English attribute their superi
ority in the distance events to the
training derived from this practice.
We in the West have allowed a city
athletic club to get ahead of us in
introducing the sport, but it now
behooves us to get into it with the
same determination that we do
into any of the track events. Sev
eral men have already gone into

training fur the Olympic Club con
test, but by no means enough.
It is preposterous to think that
among eight hundred men there
are but a bore half dozen who are
able to do distance running.
