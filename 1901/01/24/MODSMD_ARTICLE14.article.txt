Tiie Juniors have one more
chance to choose a president after
the deadlock of yesterday. That
this much-to-be-desired event will
take place if every third-year stu
dent avails himself of his privileges
there can be no question. The re
cent election did not indicate that
the class is'possessed of any super
fluity of pride in their own or
ganization, for out of a possible
one hundred and ninety but one
hundred and eleven ballots, or not
sixty per cent, were cast. It re
quires no extraordinary effort to
get out to the polling place, and a
single person absent may, in view
of the close vote, mean the ex
pense of another election.
