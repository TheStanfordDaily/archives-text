Affairs on the diamond are pro
gressing very satisfactorily, but
there has as yet been no line-up.
The men are, however, showing im
provement both in fielding and
throwing. At the last practice the
clever work of Ball was a treat to
the spectators. He picked up
everything that came his way in a
neatstyle and threw across the dia
mond very accurately. If he keeps
up to his present form he will be
seen on the Varsity. Brown and
Symonds are also showing their
old time form.
A new diamond has been laid
out in the oval and the manage
ment intends to have the games

played there. The new diamond is
not as fast as the old one, nor is it
as satisfactory on account of the
nearness of the right and left field
fences. Some sort of a fence rule
will have to be made, as it would
be unfair to allow home runs on
such short hits.
