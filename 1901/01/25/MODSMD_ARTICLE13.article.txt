The success of "James Wobberts,
Freshman" reminds us that we
have a duty of our own to perform
this semester in the way of pre
senting a creditable farce or two.
Student theatricals reflect a very
desirable phase of college life, in
which heretofore Stanford has not
been found wanting, and it is to
be hoped that this year will keep
up our reputation. However, a
poor farce is worse than none at
all, and the classes that intend do
ing anything in this line cannot
begin too early to work it up. The
writing of a successful play re
quires lime and its preparation
still more. For this reason an
early start will do much toward
securing a piece that is worthy of
the University and that may be a
fair criterion of the talent we have
among us.
