Pkrhaps it would be well to
notify our readers of the existence
of a dangerous post in the path be
tween Palo Alto and the Univer

sity. A number of the students
have learned of itu whereabouts to
the great satisfaction of local cyc
leries. The post in question was
recently cut off so that only about
a foot projects above the path, but
this one foot has caused more
trouble, more sore heads and
broken wheels, than all the other
obstructions taken together. The
enterprising person who removed
the top of this post will gain the
good will of the student body and
no doubt the silent gratitude of
many members of the faculty by
removing the offending stump.
