Affairs at the stock farm this
year are in an exceedingly prosper
ous condition. Not only is the
general class of colts much better
than it has been for several years,
but there are some that promise to
be record breakers. The manage
ment is now busily engaged in
training forty-eight head of the
most promising ones, and prepar
ing them for the Eastern market.
About the last of April these will
be shipped to Cleveland, Ohio, and
there sold. In previous years the
average price for horses turned out
from the Palo Alto farm has run
from $500 to $1,000, and the man
agement expects a high average for
this year's output.
Among the most promising year
lings are Mendolita, Serpolita, and
Mendoela. Mendolita is a full
sister to Idolita, who was the biggest
money winner in the United States
in the season of I<S ( JB, and who was
sold in two-year-old form to Senator
Jones of New Hampshire for $4,900.
She has already gone an eighth of a
mile in seventeen seconds, and will
undoubtedly be a fast horse.
Serpolita is a half-sister of Ser
pol, 2:10. Sally Benton, their dam,
has produced four horses having a
record of less than 2:20. Serpolita
has not been tried for a record, but
she has excellent form, and is
thought to be as fast as Mendolita.
Mendoela has likewise not been
driven with the object of a record
in view, but the trainers do not
hesitate to place her in the same
class with the other two fillies.
These three colts have already
been entered in a number of East
ern races, the stakes of which ag
gregate over $(5200. Some of these
races will be trotted this fall in
two-year-old form, and others will
be delayed till next season and
trotted in three-vear-old form.
