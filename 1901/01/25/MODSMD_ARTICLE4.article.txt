# LAST NIGHT'S FARCE.
## The Berkeley Play Proved a Great Success and Brought Forth Much Applause.
### 
A fair-sized audience witnessed
the production last nightof "James
Wobberts, Freshman." The crowd
went in a spirit of curiosity ming
led largely with the feeling that at
best the play would be only an
average amateur performance. Be
fore the end of the first act this ap
prehension had entirely disap
peared. "James Wobberts," in
rapidity of change, in clean, spon
taneous humor, absurd situations,
and audacious originality is the
equal of any thing now on Califor
nia boards. The steady applause
which followed its lines were sin
cere and had been honestly earned.
The cast was excellent, Schwartz
as football captain, Butler as Dave
nant, and R. W. Tully as James
Wobberts, being especially strong.
Miss Miguel and Miss Johnson
were charming in their roles as
Marian Davenan and Dulcie
Harrington. Mrs. Ewing as the
love-sick landlady, and Miss Vail
as RuthThornton, did very credit
able work. Gordenker as Nugata
furnished much amusement and
was consistent throughout.
On the whole the play is bright,
sparkling, and deserving of all the
praise it has received. It is sup
ported by an excellent company,
Argyle Tully and Marks and the
whole of the feminine portion of
the cast being professional. Stan
ford people have Berkeley to thank
for one of the pleasantest evenings
they have ever spent.
