# Professor Hoskins Injured.
## 
### 
Professor L. M. Hoskins of the
Mathematics department received
a very severe shock of electricity
yesterday evening while bathing.
In turning on the electric light he

touched tlie brass connections of
the incandescent globe, forming a
circuit with the pipes and bathtub.
The entire current of 104 volts
passed through his body for several
seconds, and probably would have
ended seriously had not Professor
Hoskins, becoming unconscious,
fallen over, thus breaking the cir
cuit. The current was strong
enough to blister the palm of his
hand and to render him faint and
weak for some time after receiving
the shock, though he regained con
sciousness the instant the circuit
was broken. Dr. Gordon was
called in during the evening. Pro
fessor lioskins did not meet his
classes today as he felt somewhat
weakened by the shock. Otherwise
he is not as seriously injured as at
first reported.
