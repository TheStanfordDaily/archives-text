# Practice on the Diamond.
## 
### 
The cold weather prevented any
brilliant work on the ball Held last
night, but several of the men
Bhowed good form. In the out
field Lowenthal did some very
good work, and in the infield Mis
ner, Brown, and Edwards played
fine ball, Pollard is showing im
provement in fielding and hitting
and promises to make a valuable
man. Parker, Bennett, and Stud
ley were tried in the box during
batting practice and they did as
well as could" be expected at this
early season. Palmtag left for his
home in Salinas yesterday and it
is very doubtful whether he will
return to college. In that case we
will have to depend on an inex
perienced man to fill the box and
the team will be greatly weakened.
"Bill" Traeger, who is trying for
first base, should practice pitching
as he has the speed to make an
effective twirler.
The first baseball game of the
season will be played on the
campus against Fireman's Fund
team on Saturday, February 2d.
The team will have to putin a
week of good conscientious work
if they hope to make a respectable
showing against the strong team
which the Firemen will undoubted
ly have.
