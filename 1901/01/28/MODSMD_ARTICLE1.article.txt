## First and Second Teams Line Up for Their First Practice Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
The first and second nines lined
up for practice for the first time
this season Saturday afternoon, and
the results were on the whole en
couraging. The second had a
slight advantage over the first at
the end of the play, which was due
perhaps to the fact that they hit
better. The batting of the Varsity
was very weak, when we consider
that the pitchers have not as yet
developed into form. The fielding
of the Varsity, however, was good
a nil at times brilliant.
Misner at second was the star of
the day and handled everything
within his territory in a masterly
stvle. Brown was also in excellent
form. His three-bagger when the
bases were full was the feature of
the game. Connors made his first
appearance on the diamond and
more than fulfilled the highest ex
pectations. Lowenthal played a
good Held and batted well. Ihe
second played good ball, but the
work of Loose in left field and Ball
on second attracted particular no
tice.
Palmer, Ballagh, Studley, Ben
nett, and Tritehie were tried in the
box, and all did good work. As
yet there seems to be no choice be
tween them. Behind the bat Cow
den, Traeger, Gundrum, Knight,
and Horn were given a trial. The
surprise of the day was the catch
ing of Traeger. lie threw to second
and blocked men at the plate like a
national leaguer. Gowden handled
the ball well, but his throwing was
not up to form, although good
throwing can scarcely be expected
so early in the season. Knight
showed his usual aggressiveness.
The line-up was as follows:
first. second.
