Work on the track is going on
splendidly. At present Manager
Oilman has four horses and twelve
men at work, and he says that the
track will be ready for use next
Thursday morning. The curbing
on the track is being repaired, and
the fence straightened up and
braced. New high-jump and pole
vault take-off has been put up and
the center of the track has been
smoothed off for baseball, while
wire netting has been put on the
fence to keep balls from going out
of the field. A considerable amount
of sand and clay has been put on
the track, which will make it much
springier than last year.
