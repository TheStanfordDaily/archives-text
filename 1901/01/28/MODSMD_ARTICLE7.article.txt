# SUNDAY SERMON.
## Rev. A.H. Briggs Delivers a Clear, Practical Address on "Things Unseen." 
### 
The liev. Arthur H. Briggs
preached a short but impressive
sermon before a large audience in
the chapel yesterday morning.
His text was taken from Hebrews
(11-27), "By faith lie foorsook
not fearing the wrath of the
king: for he endured, as seeing
him who is invisible." He said in
part:
"These state the fact and secret
of Christian endurance. So long
as the things not seen are less real
than the tilings seen, God will havs
no real influence in our lives.
When we feel what we cannot
touch, when we realize the invisible
we cannot help but endure.
"In the life of Moses there were
continually two powers at work,
the Seen and the Unseen. Natural
conditions were all against Moses;
to the materialistic Egyptian Moses
must have always seemed to have
missed the main chance of his life,
he seemed constantly to crush all
crowns of opportunity, and if there
were no recompense for his choice
of the spiritual glory over that of
the world, then were his choice
folly indeed. To accept the throne
of Egypt would have meant to re
nounce the traditions of his ances
tors, to leave the Hebrew in his
state of bondage; though natural
affection clashed with conscience,
he chose rather affliction with the
Hebrew than the material glory
attending the throne of Egypt.
"Into the lives of most of us
conies likewise the time when we
must choose between the glories of
this world and those of the unseen;
and the test of the world can be
met only by such as can grasp the
realization of the powers unseen.
Worldly things are small compared
to invisible realms to him who has
seen or felt the beyond. In the
struggle of every-day life the cur
rents of inclination and habits can
be overcome only by stronger coun
ter-currents, and Jesus offers a
stronger motive than any other
power of earth can, for the choice
of the Unseen in preference to the
Seen.
"Why, when on the plains of Sa
maria in the face of danger does
Elisha remain calm while his ser
vant trembles in fear? The ser
vant sees only the visible; but
Elisha is calm because he sees the
Invisible.
"Why, when the crowd presses
and danger threatens, does Peter
stand ready to draw his sword,
while Jesus calmly says,"Put up
thy sword. My time is not today"?
If Peter had seen as Jesus saw,
how serenely calm and divinely
strong would Peter have been!
"Why will Paul, when dragged
for the fifth time to the whipping
post, when in chains and out at
sea he is about to die of exhaustion,
and when finaPy he is stoned and
scourged, why, when the measure
of human trial and torture is about
complete, will he still in those calm
tones and earnest eyes insist that
"None of these things move me."
These light afflictions which are
but for a moment work out a far

greater glory than can come from
aught on earth.
"In vain do we say,' Paul, show
us the Invisible, let us know the
Invisible.' Experience alone can
reveal it to you. The sight may at
first be dim, but increased clearness
follows upon each sight, and in the
end each must work out the prob
lem of life and realize the Invisible
according as God reveals it to each
of us individually."
