# THE 						ROSS AFFAIR
## Not a Violation of Academic Freedom of Speech, Says the Alumni Report. 
### 
The committee appointed by the
San Francisco alumni to interview
the parties concerned in the Ross
affair and obtain, if possible, the
confidential facts in the matter,
made its report at a meeting of the
alumni last Saturday night. The
men of the committee have seen
every one they believed could give
information in the matter, mem
bers of the University and outsid
ers, about twelve in all, and have
received the confidence of both sides
of the case, gathering a mass of
testimony on which they have been
at work for over two months. The
committee confined itself strictly
to the principle involved in Mrs.
Stanford's action and her motives
have been carefully analyzed.
Its decision is given additional
weight by the admitted fact that
when the committee was appointed
a majority of its members Relieved
that the right of free speech had
been restricted in the University.
The report is as follows:
Your committee elected at the
meeting of the association held
November 20, 1900, to ascertain
the confidential and other reasons
for Dr. Ross's enforced resignation
begs leave to report:
That inasmuch as those inter
viewed, on both sides, have stipu
lated that the detailed information
received should be treated as con
fidential, your committee is able to
report only the ultimate facts.
These are as follows:
First —Mrs. Stanford shared in
the opinion general in University
circles in. 1896 that Dr. Ross's
pamphlet entitled "An Honest Dol
lar," illustrated bv political car
toons, signed by him as ''Professor
of Economics in the Leland Stan
ford Jr. University," and pub
lished and circulated by one of the
political parties during the cam
paign of that year, was undigni
fied in its form and manner of
treatment, and that it was unwise
in the point of the time and man
ner of its publication, because
jeopardizing the University's right
to a reputation for political non
partisanship. This incident, to
gether with Dr. Ross's general con
duct throughout that campaign,
was deemed by Mrs. Stanford a
symptom of unfitness for the re
sponsible position of head >112 the
Economics department of the Uni
versity.
Second —The justness of the crit
icism then expressed must be
deemed to be conceded by Dr.
Ross, since it has been admitted
l»v him to your committee that
he would not again pursue the
same course under similar circum
stances.
Third —Your committee is un
able to find that Mrs. Stanford's
objection arose because Dr. Ross's
opinion digered from her own,
since it is in evidence that she had
at that time no opinion upon
either side of the particular finan
cial theories then in issue, and since
she has not abandoned her objec
tion to bis conduct in the campaign
of 1896, although his views upon

the silver question thereafter rad
ically elm nged.
Fourth—That from December,
1891], when Dr. Ross's chair was
changed from economics to social
science, until the time of his dis
missal his position in the Univer
sity was probational.
Fifth That the want of confi
dence engendered hy the incidents
of 18%, was never removed from
Mrs. Stanford's mind, but was ac
centuated by other incidents im
pairing her faith in his good taste
and discretion. Among these your
committee has found: The use of
slang in his public and class-room
lectures, brought to her attention
by friends present, and by lam
poons in the college annuals," and
reports that his class-room lectures
contained references derogatory to
her deceased husband.
Sixth—Your committee has been
unable to find any evidence that
Mrs. Stanford ever took exceptions
to Dr. Ross's economic teachings.
Seventh —That her ultimate de
mand for bis resignation was not
due to opinions expressed* in his
speeches on "Coolie Immigration"
and the " Twentieth (Jenlury City,"
but was because she deemed that
her original estimate bad proven
correct, and that he was redisplay
ing, after three years of trial, those
qualities found objectionable in
the instance of her original action.
In passing upon the question
whether Mrs. Stanford's action in
volved any abridgment of the right
of free speech, your committee has
considered very carefully the pub
lished statement of Dr. Ross, and
the proofs upon which it is founded.
In deliberating upon these, how
ever, your committee has been un
able to escape the force of the fol
lowing facts:
First —Dr. Ross was not in the
position of one able to remain in
the University who chose to resign,
but of one who, willing to remain,
was forced to resign. His state
ment, therefore, necessarily at
tempted to tell Mrs. Stanford's
reasons for forcing him out and not
his own for going; hence it cannot
have the probative force of his own
reasons for his own acts.
Second — Dr. Ross's statement ig
nores the criticism arising from his
conduct during the campaign of
1896, notwithstanding that he knew
at the time of publishing his state
ment that it was one of the opera
tive reasons for his dismissal.
Third —The established fact that
Dr. Ross desired to remain at Stan
ford, notwithstanding Mrs. Stan
ford's criticism, is inconsistent with
the theory that he really regarded
those criticisms as involving any
abridgment of his right of free
speech.
Fourth —The admission of Dr.
Ross to your committee that he
would not regard a. University rule
against the participation in poli
tics by a University professor of
economics during the progress of a
political campaign as impairing
the proper right of academic free
dom disposes of his contention that
the criticism of his conduct in 1896
is capable of that construction.
From the foregoing facts and
upon the testimony as a whole
your committee concludes that the

action of Mrs. Stanford in asking
the dismissal of Dr. Ross involved
no infringement of the right of
free speech.

toons, signed by him as ''Professor
of Economics in the Leland Stan
ford Jr. University," and pub
lished and circulated by one of the
political parties during the cam
paign of that year, was undigni
fied in its form and manner of
treatment, and that it was unwise
in the point of the time and man
ner of its publication, because
jeopardizing the University's right
to a reputation for political non
partisanship. This incident, to
gether with Dr. Ross's general con
duct throughout that campaign,
was deemed by Mrs. Stanford a
symptom of unfitness for the re
sponsible position of head >112 the
Economics department of the Uni
versity.
Second —The justness of the crit
icism then expressed must be
deemed to be conceded by Dr.
Ross, since it has been admitted
l»v him to your committee that
he would not again pursue the
same course under similar circum
stances.
Third —Your committee is un
able to find that Mrs. Stanford's
objection arose because Dr. Ross's
opinion digered from her own,
since it is in evidence that she had
at that time no opinion upon
either side of the particular finan
cial theories then in issue, and since
she has not abandoned her objec
tion to bis conduct in the campaign
of 1896, although his views upon

the silver question thereafter rad
ically elm nged.
Fourth—That from December,
1891], when Dr. Ross's chair was
changed from economics to social
science, until the time of his dis
missal his position in the Univer
sity was probational.
Fifth That the want of confi
dence engendered hy the incidents
of 18%, was never removed from
Mrs. Stanford's mind, but was ac
centuated by other incidents im
pairing her faith in his good taste
and discretion. Among these your
committee has found: The use of
slang in his public and class-room
lectures, brought to her attention
by friends present, and by lam
poons in the college annuals," and
reports that his class-room lectures
contained references derogatory to
her deceased husband.
Sixth—Your committee has been
unable to find any evidence that
Mrs. Stanford ever took exceptions
to Dr. Ross's economic teachings.
Seventh —That her ultimate de
mand for bis resignation was not
due to opinions expressed* in his
speeches on "Coolie Immigration"
and the " Twentieth (Jenlury City,"
but was because she deemed that
her original estimate bad proven
correct, and that he was redisplay
ing, after three years of trial, those
qualities found objectionable in
the instance of her original action.
In passing upon the question
whether Mrs. Stanford's action in
volved any abridgment of the right
of free speech, your committee has
considered very carefully the pub
lished statement of Dr. Ross, and
the proofs upon which it is founded.
In deliberating upon these, how
ever, your committee has been un
able to escape the force of the fol
lowing facts:
First —Dr. Ross was not in the
position of one able to remain in
the University who chose to resign,
but of one who, willing to remain,
was forced to resign. His state
ment, therefore, necessarily at
tempted to tell Mrs. Stanford's
reasons for forcing him out and not
his own for going; hence it cannot
have the probative force of his own
reasons for his own acts.
Second — Dr. Ross's statement ig
nores the criticism arising from his
conduct during the campaign of
1896, notwithstanding that he knew
at the time of publishing his state
ment that it was one of the opera
tive reasons for his dismissal.
Third —The established fact that
Dr. Ross desired to remain at Stan
ford, notwithstanding Mrs. Stan
ford's criticism, is inconsistent with
the theory that he really regarded
those criticisms as involving any
abridgment of his right of free
speech.
Fourth —The admission of Dr.
Ross to your committee that he
would not regard a. University rule
against the participation in poli
tics by a University professor of
economics during the progress of a
political campaign as impairing
the proper right of academic free
dom disposes of his contention that
the criticism of his conduct in 1896
is capable of that construction.
From the foregoing facts and
upon the testimony as a whole
your committee concludes that the

action of Mrs. Stanford in asking
the dismissal of Dr. Ross involved
no infringement of the right of
free speech.
The committee appointed by the
San Francisco alumni to interview
the parties concerned in the Ross
affair and obtain, if possible, the
confidential facts in the matter,
made its report at a meeting of the
alumni last Saturday night. The
men of the committee have seen
every one they believed could give
information in the matter, mem
bers of the University and outsid
ers, about twelve in all, and have
received the confidence of both sides
of the case, gathering a mass of
testimony on which they have been
at work for over two months. The
committee confined itself strictly
to the principle involved in Mrs.
Stanford's action and her motives
have been carefully analyzed.
Its decision is given additional
weight by the admitted fact that
when the committee was appointed
a majority of its members Relieved
that the right of free speech had
been restricted in the University.
The report is as follows:
Your committee elected at the
meeting of the association held
November 20, 1900, to ascertain
the confidential and other reasons
for Dr. Ross's enforced resignation
begs leave to report:
That inasmuch as those inter
viewed, on both sides, have stipu
lated that the detailed information
received should be treated as con
fidential, your committee is able to
report only the ultimate facts.
These are as follows:
First —Mrs. Stanford shared in
the opinion general in University
circles in. 1896 that Dr. Ross's
pamphlet entitled "An Honest Dol
lar," illustrated bv political car
toons, signed by him as ''Professor
of Economics in the Leland Stan
ford Jr. University," and pub
lished and circulated by one of the
political parties during the cam
paign of that year, was undigni
fied in its form and manner of
treatment, and that it was unwise
in the point of the time and man
ner of its publication, because
jeopardizing the University's right
to a reputation for political non
partisanship. This incident, to
