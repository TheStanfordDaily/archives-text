The decision of the San Fran
cisco alumni that in the removal of
Dr. Ross the academic right of free
speech has not been restricted by
the University management may
reasonably be taken as an oppor
tunity to consider that the discus
sion of this afiair is at an end and
that the University has regained
whatever measure of confidence
may have been shaken by a mis
understanding of the case. The
question as to whether liberty of
speech was violated has been from
first to last the one question in
which the students, the alumni,
and the public generally have been
concerned. The personal differ
ences arising from the event itself
have not concerned us further than
as a matter of friendship for the
parties involved. In every case
the retiring professors have had
the respect and confidence of their
students and friends, whose sincere
regret follows them from the Uni
versity. The merits of each case
were not for us to weigh or decide.
But in the principle declared to be
involved in the reason for Dr.
Ross's removal, we had an interest
and a right to be considered, and
now that a committee of represen
tative graduates of the University
have received the confidential facts
on both sides, with the proofs oral
and documentary, and have de
cided after careful deliberation that
the principle involved has not been
violated, their decision will con
firm the confidence of the majority
of us and set at rest whatever hon
est doubts may have arisen through
this unfortunate affair.
