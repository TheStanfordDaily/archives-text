The meaning and importance of
the proposed laws relating to Stan
ford University does not seem to be
generally appreciated by the stud
ents and friends of the institution.
One of the bills introduced in the
present Legislature is intended to

confer upon the trustees of the Un
iversity the right to exercise their
powers as trustees in the manner
and form of corporate boards of di
rectors. The bill does not convert
the board of trustees into a corpor
ation. Its only purpose is to per
mit the trustees to perform their
functions more conveniently. At
present a majority of the board
must sign all official documents.
The bill is designed to permit them
to meet as a board and authorize
their officers to carry out their
wishes. The other bill provides for
a very limited exemption from tax
ation. The constitutional amend
ment authorizes the exemption of
all the University property from all
taxation, excepting ranches (other
than the Palo Alto farm), and other
business real estate, which the
amendment does not permit the leg
islature to exempt from local taxes.
The whole real estate exemption
authorized was, at the time
the amendment passed the legis
lature, less than twelve thous
and dollars, and is today but a few
thousand dollars more than that
amount. The bill introduced pro
vides for an even narrower exemp
tion than that authorized. The
proposed exemption is confined to
the University buildings and such
bonds as the institution may now
or hereafter hold. To the exemp
tion of the buildings the represent
atives from Santa Clara county
have assented, and there should be
no objection from other eounties,
which lose practically nothing
thereby. The exemption of such
bonds as the University may hold
is merely nominal, since the Uni
versity cannot profitably hold tax
able bonds unless so exempted. By
the removal of the present restric
tion upon the investment of the
University funds the State will lose
nothing, but enable the University
to greatly increase the capacity of
the institution by investing in
bonds producing a larger income.
The bill also provides for free tui
tion to residents of California.
