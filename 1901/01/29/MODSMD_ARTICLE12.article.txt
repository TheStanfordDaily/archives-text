# Athletics at Berkeley.
## 
### 
Walter Christie, Princeton's
famous trainer, has been secured
by the University of California to
train all of her athletic teams for
two years, at a salary of $1,200 per
year. He will arrive in about two
weeks and will immediately take
charge of the baseball and track
teams. His coming will probably
obviate the necessity for a baseball
coach, as he understands the na
tional game thoroughly.
Christie's qualifications as a
trainer are of the highest order.
He is a professional athlete who
has done the 100 yards in nine and
three-fifths seconds. He has been
two years at Princeton as head
trainer in charge of all the track,
baseball, and football teams. Dur
ing the past football season he ac
companied Garrett Cochran to
Annapolis, and under him as
coach trained the Naval Academy
football eleven. He is considered
to be unsurpassed in his work, and
among all the trainers the Califor
nia track team had the opportun
ity of observing in the East last
spring, Christie was admired the
most.
The first Varsity baseball game
will take place on the Berkeley
campus on February 9th with the
Fireman's Fund team of San Fran
cisco. Games will be played with
the same team on February 23d,
March 2d, 16th, and 23d. The
management will also secure games
with the professional nines around
the bay. Later on a trip to Reno
will be taken to play the team of
the University of Nevada.
Captain Hunter called the base
ball candidates together yesterday
afternoon. Thirty-six men signed
for practice. The only players of
last year's Varsity who have re
turned to college are Captain
Hunter, Catcher Smith, Right
Fielder Hamlin, and Third Base
man Braley. Of the new men, the
most promising is Orval Overall,
the giant Visalia twirler, who is
expected to do the pitching for the
team.
