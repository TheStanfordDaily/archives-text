# Baseball Practice.

### 
There was no line-upyesterday on
the diamond and the practice was
rather unsatisfactory. The men
show a great weakness at the bat.
With only straight pitching sever
al of the promising Varsity men
swung as many as three times
without touching the ball. The
difficulty seems to be that they try
to hit the ball too hard and fail to
make connections at all. Unless
the men make some effort to im
prove their stick work, we cannot
hope to make a respectable show
ing in the game next Saturday.
Parker, Palmer, and Yerrington
were doing the twirling and showed
fair form. Yerrington has a good"
style of delivery and works hard.
He is among the strongest candi
dates for pitcher.
Manager Warren has announced
the schedule for the class games
which will be played next week.
The first game will be between the
Juniors arid Seniors on Monday
afternoon, February 4th. The
Sophomores and Freshmen play on
the following Wednesday. The
winners of these will play the final
game on Friday afternoon, Febru
ary Bth.
