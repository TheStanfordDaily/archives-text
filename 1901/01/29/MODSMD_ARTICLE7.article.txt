President Jordan discussed the
"Greatest Scientific Discovery of
the Nineteenth Century" before the
Unitarian Clul> in Kan Francisco
last evening. He spoke of the dis
covery of extinct animals hy
Cuvier, the discoveries of Lyell in
Geology, the discovery that all
forces are one in different form, the
discovery of the • utility of democ
racy; and to each he gave a high
place. "Hut (hegreatest discovery,"
lie said, "was evolution." The idea
did not belong to the nineteenth
century, being very much older,
but the century had discovered its
application; more important was
the coincident discovery of how to
apply the human mind to research.
"It used to be held that some
church, some God, was in waiting
to tell us the truth of things," he
said, "but we have found that
truth does not come by revelation
but bv patient searching."
