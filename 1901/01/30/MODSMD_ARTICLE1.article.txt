# TUESDAY EVENING LECTURE.
## Chew's Address on "The Trouble in China as Viewed by a Chinaman." 
### 
Yesterday evening at 7:30 p.m.
Ng l'oon Chew lectured in the
chapel on "The Trouble in China
as Viewed by a Chinaman." He is
the Chinese consul at San Fran
cisco, as well as the editor of the
"Chung Sat Cat P 0," the Chinese
daily paper, and so very well quali
fied to speak on such a subject as
this one. His English was re
markably good, and his address
delivered clearly and forcibly,
though with a strong Chinese ac
cent, which, on the whole, was
rather pleasing. He said:
"To hold fast to what is good is
our principle in China. \\ e shun
change like an evil, and regard our
civilization as the greatest benefit
the past could bestow. We are es
sentially conservative, and long
with wistful eyes for the good old
days of the great past. Here in
America everyone is crazy for a
change, whether it be for good or
for evil. We, on the other hand,
are what you Americans might call
old fogies.
"Though there are many virtues
in our Chinese race, in self-conceit
we are ahead of all the world.
Nevertheless, we have some reason
to be proud of ourselves. We are
the only people who have preserved
our civilization over two thousand
years, and throughout all that
time China has been the protector
of other Asiatic nations. 1 am as
proud of my country, in spite of
all her faults and weaknesses, as
you are of yours.
"In the Chinese system of educa
tion, the mind is developed at the
expense of the body. 1 he Chinese
are taught that China is the center
of the world, and true to their
teaching, they regard the rest of the
world as barbarians. They are not
versed in the art of destruction be
cause they are taught that war is
barbarous and brutal. In this re
spect, some of the European na
tions might learn a valuable lesson
from China.
"A great menace to Chinese civ
ilization is the spirit of drastic re
form inculcated by our last em
peror, a spirit the empress dowager
destroyed by imprisoning the em
peror and murdering many of his
followers.
"The whole history of foreigners
in China has been a story of bull
dozing and extortion on the one
hand, and of cruelty and treachery
on the other. Opium is a great
curse to China, for it deadens the
senses and blights the ambitions.
Whiskey makes a man brutal, but
opium takes away his sensibility.
After a man has taken whiskey, he
kicks his wife, but after he has
taken opium his wife kicks him.
Perhaps that is why Americans
drink whiskey. The Opium War
in 1839, which grew out of an at
tempt made by England to force us
to buy opium, will be forever a blot
upon the European nations.
"Our last fifty years have been
the history of many injuries suf
fered at the hands of the foreigners.
A small casus belli, such as the
breaking of a few English heads,

has Ween the pretext for seizures of
territory and the establishment, of
provinces and spheres of influence.
What right has England to con
trol Hongkong, or Russia and (Ger
many to steal our possessions?
The United States in the only na
tion in which we have confidence,
because it is the only one that does
not occupy any Chinese territory.
When it comes to treaties, China
always keeps tier word, but on the
other side, look at the way the
European nations treat us. On
the whole, friends, the Chinese suf
fer more at the hands of the for
eigners, than foreigners at the
hands of the Chinese.
"in the matter of missionaries
we must careful ly distinguish be
tween the Protestant missionaries
and the Roman Catholic missionar
ies. We hate the Protestant mis
sionaries only as the subjects of
nations that we hate, and not be
cause they are missionaries. But
with the Roman Catholic ones the
case is different. They interfere
seriously with the administration
of justice, by establishing courts of
their own and thus forming an im
perium in imperii >, which is very
galling to the Chinese. Still even
this could be put up with, if it were
not for the fact that by proselyting
the Roman Catholic missionaries
act as a cat's paw for the extortion
of territory, instead of simply
trying to reform the heathen and
prevent them from going to purga
tory.
"Could there be anything more
outrageous and heartless than this
tale of the partition of China?
What will come of it? Ido not be
lieve that China will ever be par
titioned. Ido believe that she has
a great future in store for her. Her
people are full of vitality and
strength, and in time she will take
her place among the great, nations
of the world."

tempt made by England to force us
to buy opium, will be forever a blot
upon the European nations.
"Our last fifty years have been
the history of many injuries suf
fered at the hands of the foreigners.
A small casus belli, such as the
breaking of a few English heads,

has Ween the pretext for seizures of
territory and the establishment, of
provinces and spheres of influence.
What right has England to con
trol Hongkong, or Russia and (Ger
many to steal our possessions?
The United States in the only na
tion in which we have confidence,
because it is the only one that does
not occupy any Chinese territory.
When it comes to treaties, China
always keeps tier word, but on the
other side, look at the way the
European nations treat us. On
the whole, friends, the Chinese suf
fer more at the hands of the for
eigners, than foreigners at the
hands of the Chinese.
"in the matter of missionaries
we must careful ly distinguish be
tween the Protestant missionaries
and the Roman Catholic missionar
ies. We hate the Protestant mis
sionaries only as the subjects of
nations that we hate, and not be
cause they are missionaries. But
with the Roman Catholic ones the
case is different. They interfere
seriously with the administration
of justice, by establishing courts of
their own and thus forming an im
perium in imperii >, which is very
galling to the Chinese. Still even
this could be put up with, if it were
not for the fact that by proselyting
the Roman Catholic missionaries
act as a cat's paw for the extortion
of territory, instead of simply
trying to reform the heathen and
prevent them from going to purga
tory.
"Could there be anything more
outrageous and heartless than this
tale of the partition of China?
What will come of it? Ido not be
lieve that China will ever be par
titioned. Ido believe that she has
a great future in store for her. Her
people are full of vitality and
strength, and in time she will take
her place among the great, nations
of the world."
