' Jamks YVobberts, Freshman,"
the University of California farce,
should l>e greeted l>y a much larger
house next Friday evening than
the one of last Thursday. Many
people had the idea at that time
that it was a very amateurish play,
but all those who attended it were
most agreeably surprised. Of all
the farces that have been played at
Stanford, not one has received such
universal commendation as has
followed the appearance of this
one. The audience was kept laugh
ing from the start to the end of the
play. The neat way in which the
writer gets Tom Harrington out of
the last of his predicaments is a
triumph worthy of a professional
playwright. This is a college play
written especially for college stud
ents, and anyone living here who
attends it will say with us when it
is over that he or she never enjoyed
a farce more.
