The manager of the 1902 Annual
sent circulars to all delinquent jun
iors today, reminding them that
their assessments remain unpaid.
An unusually large per cent, of dues
has already been collected, a fact
which reflects great credit on both
class and management, but not so
many that the success of the book
is entirely assured. Hut little
time now remains to get the copy
into the publisher's hands, and it
is highly desirable that the remain
ing dues be in at once. It is not
simply a question of whether one's
photograph shall appear with those
of his classmates; the whole mat
ter of pride in his organization is
involved. So far from being a bur
den, a requirement like this should
be reckoned among the pleasantest
duties of a student. In this par
ticular case, there is no adequate
reason for forcing on two-thirds of
the members the responsibility de
signed for all.
