The reorganization of the Choral
Society of the University should
meet with the hearty approval and
active co-operation of University
people. The membership of the
Glee Club is necessarily limited,
and only a small proportion of
students reap any material benefit
from it. A choral society is open
to all, irrespective of training or
natural ability. It is an organ
ization with the express purpose of
furnishing the practice and exper
ience necessary to develop good
singers. There is plenty of mater
ial in the University to warrant the
existence of a large chorus which
will take the place of a musical
department. In fact such a society
is badly needed to furnish much of
the vocal music at University
entertainments, and is especially
needed during commencement
week. There should be at least
two hundred students to take ad
vantage of this opportunity of a
personal gain which will eventually
reflect to the credit and honor of
their Alma Mater.
