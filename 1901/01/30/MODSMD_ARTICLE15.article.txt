# Tennis Outlook.
## 
### 
Oar outlook in tennis seems very
bright at* present. Hard, snappy
practice goes on at the courts every
afternoon, with honors about even
ly divided between Misner, Roth,
Adams, and Weihe. The latter
two do not seem to be up to their
best form. Leib and Baker are
showing up well, and will make a
hard fight for places on the tenm.
The courts are in very poor con
dition. Large cracks extend in all
directions and prevent many good
plays. It is hoped that improve
ments will be made in the near fut
ure.
Berkeley's best players peem to
be Hunt and Selby. McGavin puts
up a strong steady game, but will
in all probability be unable to win
out against the two men named
above.
Our chances for winning the
doubles this year seem very good,
but the singles will require a hard
fight.
