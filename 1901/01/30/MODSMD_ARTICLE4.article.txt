The men 011 the diamond showed
a little improvement in the line-up
yesterday, ImL the work is still far
from what it ought to be. The
balling wan fair, hut ihe fielding
was erratic and careless. The men
on the infield seem to be unable to
handle thrown balls and costly
errors result. Although their were
over ten attempts at base stealing,
noi a put-out resulted.
Traeger and Horn were the op
posing backstops, while Studley
and Tritch tilled the other end of
the batteries. Traeger tore oft a
hit each time he faced the plate,
and his catching showed improve
ment. He was also of great value
to the team in keeping the men
''jollied up." Horn's experience
probably puts him in the lead for
catcher, but his baiting is not up
to the standard. The pitchers
worked very well. Tritch has
plenty of speed and good curves,
but his control is poor. Studley
was very effective. Cowden was
changed from catcher to first base,
and Hall was placed in the out
field. Cowden plays a good first,
base, and Ball is a valuable man
wherever he is placed. Both
changes will improve the team.
Young made some good plays at
second base, and l'almer did some
good hitting and fielding.
The line was as follows:
VAKS1TY SECOND
Horn c Traeger
Studley p Tritch
Cowden 1 b Bentley
Crawford 2 b Young
Edwards s s Bowers
Brown 3 b Luck
Ball If Lowenthai
Symonds c f L oose
Palmer r f Lamb
The members of the Sophomore
baseball squad at a meeting yester
day afternoon elected R. B. Ball
captain by a unanimous vote. Ball
comes here from the Santa Ana
High School, where he was captain
of the baseball team. He has also
played at Pomona His strong po
sition is second base, and his in
field work is especially strong. He
is also one of the strongest batters
of the team. Among the other
Sophomore players are to be noticed
Horn, Moore, Misner, Studley,
Knight, Lowenthai, Traeger, Con
ner, Luck, Pollard, Gundrum, and
Lamb.
The Freshman squad is weak,
there being only seven men out for
practice. These are Ballagh,
Bowers, Tritch, Van Dine, Luce,
Lockwood, and S. Taylor. As the
Freshman-Sophomore game will
be played a week from yesterday,it is
necessary that more Freshmen turn
out immediately.
The 1902 men who played on
their class team last year met on
the diamond this afternoon and
elected 1). V. Cowden captain of
the class team for this year. Cow
den is a Law major, registered
from San Jose, and is also a mem
ber of -Delta Upsilon fraternity.
He has always taken great interest
in baseball, and played second

sity.
