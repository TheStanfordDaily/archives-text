# "JAS. WOBBERTS, FRESHMAN."
## The 						Berkeley Farce Will be Played in the Assembly Hall Again Friday Evening. 
### 
"J amen W'obberts, Freshman,"
the fnice presented at the Assem
bly Hall last Thursday night by
the students from Berkeley, is dated
for a second performance on next
Friday night.
All those who attended the lirsl
performance of Mr. Tully's play
were unanimous that it was the
best thing ever been on ihe campus
and close up in rank to any pro
fessional production, it was a
success from first rise of the cur
tain to the last tableau at the first
performance. The house was in
roars of laughter all the tune.
Judging from the success that
"James \\ obherts" made at iho
first appearanee, the management
have consented to those who
did not see the play another oppor
tunity on Friday night.
The show from Berkeley should
receive a better welcome on its
second appearanee. This perform
ance on the campus on Friday
night will be the last one for the
play as a college production.
Early in February Manager
Th omas and Richard Tully will
take the play East to complete ar
rangements for its production in
New York next fall at the Herald
Square Theater on Broadway. The
rights have been purchased by a
well known Eastern manager and
will be given a good run.
Seats for Friday night will be on
sale at the University postoffice
Thursday morning at nine o'clock,
and at the postoffice in Palo Alto
at ten thirty. The prices will be
reduced, reserved seats will be
fifty and thirty-five cents, general
admission Iwentv-five. The same
cast that appeared before will be
seen again.
