Most of the students were look
ing forward to Dr. Elliott's rejoin
der to the Chaparral's criticism of
his article in the Sequoia with a
great deal of interest. They ex
pected an exciting answer, but
found that his communication to
the editor of the Chaparral was
neither exciting, nor was it an an
swer. It is very cleverly written,
but the substance of it is not in di
rect reference to either M the two
former articles. Indeed, Dr. Elliott
seems to evade any concrete review
of the subject, contenting himself
witw calling attention to the "aw
ful solemnity" of the ChaparraVs
answers to what he intended whol
ly as a huge joke, which he is now
at the "task of explaining." He
had no idea his remarks would be

taken seriously by "any very large
number, either of undergraduates
or alumni." In view of this lat
est appearance of Dr. Elliott, we
would suggest that hereafter he
label his so-called humorous pro
ductions "This is meant to be fun
ny,"—else we commoners with a
less finely developed sense of the
ludicrous may take them seriously
and be skeptical as to his explana
tions that appear later.
