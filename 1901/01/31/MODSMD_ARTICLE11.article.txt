The following self-explanatory
letter has been received by the
president of the Associated Students
from the [(resident of the chess
club at the University of California:
Mr. CIiCIL MARRACK,
Dear Sir: —Perhaps you may re
call the fact that in the years 1897-
98-99 intercollegiate chess matches
took place between the University
of California and Stanford. Last
year (1900), however, no match or
tournament came off, —due to the
fact that the chess organization of
Stanford had so lost its cohesive
ness as to become indifferent to
such a contest. Recalling, how
ever, an editorial which appeared
in the Sequoia at the beginning of
last semester to the effect that Stan
ford should endeavor to foster rath
er than give up the second of the
intellectual contests between the
two universities, it occurs to me
that for this year it might be desir
able to both colleges to hold a tour
nament similar to those of former
years, and thus maintain what at
one time seemed to be a regular an
nual intellectual contest at chess —
similar to those prevailing among
the intercollegiate league in the
East, consisting of Harvard, Yale,
Columbia, and Princeton.
Now, on behalf of theChessClub
of the 'University of California,
permit me to ask your assistance in
this matter. By making this com
munication known to those at
Stanford who are interested in the
subject, you will greatly oblige.
Hoping to hear from you on the
matter, I am,
Very truly yours,
Wesley V. Hohfeld.
