# Bill Passes Assembly.

### 
Assembly bill 191, conferring
full corporate powers and privi
leges on the trustees of Stanford
University, was passed Tuesday
without a dissenting vote. This is
the first legislative action on the
amendment passed by the people
last November. The purposes of
the bill is to permit the trustees to
perform their functions more con

board is now necessary to sign all
official documents, and the bill
will enable them to meet as a
board and transact business
through their officers.
