# Baseball Line-Up.
## 
### 
The playing on the diamond yes
terday was the best seen here this
season. Edwards was at his best
and gave a fine exhibition of how
his position should be played. He
covered plenty of ground, made
many good pick-ups, and threw
fast and accurate. Misner and
Brown were also in fine form and
covered their bags in good style.
Cowden is playing good ball on
first base and is easily the strong
est man for the position at present.
Symonds, Ball, and Lowenthal are
playing the best game in the out
field. Horn and Traeger are in
the lead for catcher and there
seems to be little choice between
them. The pitchers are showing
considerable improvement. Par
ker and Bennett show the best form
but the other candidates are not
far behind them.
Hereafter the baseball squad
will be divided into two sections,
one of which will be under the di
rection of Dr. Murphy, while the
other will be under Swindells, '01.
By this division both diamonds
will be used and a much greater
number of candidates can practice
at the same time. This new sys
tem will give the new men a much
better chance to develop than was
possible under the old.
