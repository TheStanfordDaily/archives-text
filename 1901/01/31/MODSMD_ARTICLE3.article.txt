### 
University lovers of music are
to be given a treat on February 13,
when Mdlle. Antonia Dolores ap
pears in Assembly Hall. As a re
sult of artistic temperament com
bined with study, training, and ex
perience, Mlie. Dolores is one of the
most popular sopranos now on the
concert stage. She appeared in
San Francisco last January, ami of
her art the Examiner had this to
say at that time: "There seems
little to offer that has not yet been
often said in its praise. She is de
cidedly the best music lesson that
vocal devotees of this town have
enjoyed for a. long time, if, indeed,
an example is as potent as precept.
She gets so near to perfection in
everything she does, that it must
be a. very wise critic, or a very
captious one, who is not thoroughly
satisfied. There is so much hearti
ness, health, sincerity, and elo
quence in her splendid singing that
she is a model for all who try to
sing."
