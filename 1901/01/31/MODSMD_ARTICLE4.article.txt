# THIS AFTERNOONâ€™S LECTURE.
## Dr. Albion W. Small Delivers a Very Interesting Address in the Chapel. 
### 
Dr. Albion W. Small, professor of
sociology in the University of Chi
cago, lectured to a large audience
in the chapel at 1:30 this afternoon,
Dr. Jordan presiding. The ad
dress was very interesting and very
well received. Dr. Small said in
part:
"A country can not go very far
wrong which can produce so many
investigators as are found in our
student gatherings. Students are
to be congratulated not so much
for what they learn in class rooms
and laboratories, as for the prepar
ation they receive for social life.
The students of this institution are
to be especially congratulated for
being situated in the West. The
East is provincial. But it is,possi
ble for you to realize that it takes
the whole number of States to make
the Union. You are also to be con
gratulated for appearing at this op
portune time. It once seemed to
me that the boundless West we
read of was a myth. The phrase
that there is no chance for the
young man today is a lie. There
is the same chance today for men
who can make two blades of grass
grow where one grew before that
there was thirty years ago. The
man who can do anything better or
cheaper than it was done before
need take no thought of the future.
It is no more presumptuous for a
man to make plans for being a pro
fessor than it is for him to prepare
for the carpenter's trade.
"There are only two conditions to
be satisfied in order to achieve suc
cess. One is to learn from those who
are competent to pass intelligent
judgment on the qualities of one's
mind-and the second is careful prep
aration. It is the primary function
of the college to enable a man to
find himself; of the university to
prepare him for that end. There
is sufficient preparation available
in our country to place one at the
head of any of the academic pro
fessions. It is a common mistake
for men and women to leave college
before the completion of their
course, and to accept positions be
cause they are a little better pre
pared than the average man. If a
man finds out what the average
a hi ity is, and prepares several
years beyond that, he is sure of
success. The pursuit of good citi
zenship is the true vocation of the
college man, as he is able to bring
sanity and balance to all questions.
There is a vocation in America for
the crank; as a martyr to this or
the other cause he enables us to see
things in their proper light. There
are truths pointed out by the bit
terest socialists, but when com
pared with properly proportioned
truth which a correct perspective
supplies, they sink into nothing
ness. While there is this vocation
for the crank, university men
should not be the element to fur
nish cranks.
"We are all dealing with prob
lems. We have to lead a life of
problems. Any way of doing the
world's business, or any one doing

it, is a problem, if it is possible to
ask of him or it, 'Is it possible to do
the work better than it is being
done?' It is not right to hush agi
tation over any social problem,
neither is it right for one to take
them up in the spirit of an advo
cate rather than in that of a judge.
Our great trouble is that
we want to deal with most
problems before they may be
said properly to have arrived.
The trust question may be one of
these. If we should deal with it in
a judicial-minded manner, we
might find it to be a part of the ad
vance of civilization. Future gen
erations will meet problems and
make advances of which we know
little, and the one thing that I
might desire to live for is to see
what advance the future genera
tions attain."
