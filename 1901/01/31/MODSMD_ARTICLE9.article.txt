The interest of the student body
will be centered for the next few
days on debating. Tomorrow and
Saturday evenings the intercolleg
iate preliminaries are to be held in
the chapel, and next week the
Berkeley team will come down to
compete for the Carnot medal. It
is needless to dwell on the impor
tance of attending the last event;
the Assembly Hall will be jammed
anyway. But we would like to
made a plea for a good attendance
at these preliminaries. It is from
the ranks of these humble contes
tants that winners of future debates
are going to come, and encourag
ment plays as great a part in the
making of a varsity debater as in
a varsity athlete. But in the rows
of empty seats which have usually
greeted the speakers in the try-outs
there is only discouragement. In
many cases it is a sympathetic aud
ience that brings out a speaker's
powers. We can not all be inter
collegiate debaters, but we can help
in making them. It is our duty
and should be our pleasure to get
out to the chapel tomorrow and
Saturday evenings.
