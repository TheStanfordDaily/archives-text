At this time, when the begin
ning of spring athletics and debat
ing are absorbing so much of onr
attention, we should not forget that
Stanford has interests much more
important for her welfare than in
tercollegiate contests, and that
there is an excellent opportunity
now offered us of demonstrating
again that Stanford spirit is not
confined to the winning of games.
The results of the last election led
us to believe that the battle was
practically won in regard to the
amendment, but reports from the
Legislature, however, indicate that
we are in danger of being deprived
of some of the fruits of our victory.
Tax exemption is not meeting with
the favor at Sacramento that it
found among the people, and judg
ing from appearances, this part of
the amendment will notcarry with
out another contest. Influence
with individual legislators, there
fore, will count for a great deal,
and every Stanford man or woman
should be willing to take a little
trouble to do what he or she can.
