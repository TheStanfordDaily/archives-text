Tomorrow afternoon the student
body will have an opportunity to
show their appreciation of the con
scientious work which has been
done on the diamond. The base
ball outlook was at the beginning
of the season, to say the least,
gloomy, but by the incessant labors
of Dr. Murphy and Captain Ed
wards an entirely different aspect
has been given to baseball affairs.
The vacancies made bv the gradu
ation of five members of last year's
team have been quite successfully
filled, and we now have a team
upon whom 'we can depend to make
a creditable showing. Jt is true
that we cannot predict victory
against the strong team which the
Firemen will have, although victory
is by no means impossible, but we
can guarantee that those who go to
the game tomorrow will see some

good baseball. A large attendance
at the game tomorrow will show
the baseball men that their work is
appreciated and will encourage
them to put forth their best efforts.
Whatever the result of tomorrow's
game shall be, there will be 110 rea
son for discouragement or unfair
criticism. Let us remember that
the team is made up largely of new
men and that they will improve as
the season advances.
