Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The social functions of Stanford
students are as a rule most success
ful. Anyone acquainted with the
attention to detail required to
make large dancing parties pass
off smoothly can have nothing but
praise for the executive ability and
energy displayed by those who
have these parties in charge.
There seems to be, however, un
certainty in the minds of some in
regard to the proper attitude to
ward the ladies asked to act ns
patronesses. These ladies are the
hostesses of the occasion, and eti
quette requires that those present
should, at some time during the
evening, pay their respects to them.
Those unacquainted with the re
ceiving party should ask a friend
or a member of the committee to
present them.
The fact that a party is large or
in a public place does not excuse
the omission of the courtesies ob
served at smaller functions in pri
vate houses.
The ladies who are asked to re
ceive the company should, of
course, be the lirst arrivals, and
the number should not be so large
as to make the process of receiving
either tedious or complicated.
It might be well to suggest that
the young ladies who attend these
social functions should go in par
ties accompanied by chaperons.
This is especially desirable here at
Stanford, where the young ladies
are away from home surroundings
and practically unacquainted with
the young men.
The good intentions of siudents
can always be depended upon, and
these suggestions are, J am sure,
all that are needed to correct slight
defects in otherwise very successful
entertainments.
Patroness.
