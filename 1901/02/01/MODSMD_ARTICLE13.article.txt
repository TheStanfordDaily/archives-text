# Exemption Bill Passes Senate.
## 
### 
The Cutter bill, exempting the
buildings and bonds of Stanford
University from taxation, was
passed by the Senate yesterday by
a vote of '23 to 1. There was a pro
longed discussion both for and
against the amendment, but Rowell
was the only one who strenuously
opposed the bill, and his was the
one negative vote.
