The first and second nine played
some good baseball in the line-up
yesterday. The work of the Var
sity infield, consisting of Covvden,
Misner, Edwards, and Brown, com
pared favorably with our infield
work at the end of last season. If
these men play as well in the game
Saturday as they have been play
ing in practice, the Firemen will

get very few bases on errors. The
outfielders are showing improve
ment, but they don't cover enough
ground. Behind the bat, Traeger
has been making wonderful pro
gress, and if he develops at the
present rate he will no doubt catch
the Berkeley games. Parker, Pal
mer, Bennett, and Studlev are do
ing good work in the box, and all
will be given a trial in the game
tomorrow.
The line-up last night was as
follows:
VARSITY. SECOND.
Traeger c , G rider

Gowden 1 b McFadden
Misner 2 b Mitchell
Brown r 112 Pollard

The Varsity will cross bats to
morrow with the Firemen's Fund
team for the first game of the sea
son. The Firemen have a particu
larly strong team, many of the
players being prominent in pro
fessional baseball circles. Van
lialtren, who has been playing in
the national league for a number
of years, will play center field.
Moskimon, who will do the twirl
ing, and Hammond, who will
play short stop, have both
played with Oakland during the
