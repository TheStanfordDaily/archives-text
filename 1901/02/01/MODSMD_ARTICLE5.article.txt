# HOAGLAND ENTHUSIASTIC.
## A 						Disciple of Pacific Coast Football Bestows Compliments on Players, Coaches, and Students. 
### 
"The possibilities of football on
the Pacific Coast," is the title of an
article by the gridiron authority,
E. G. Westlake, now going the
rounds of the Eastern press. The
information on which the article
was based was gleaned from con
versations with Ralph Hoagland,
Princeton, '95, whose efficient um
piring was a feature of the last
Thanksgiving game. A few ex
tracts will indicate the tone of the
comments.
"Mr. Hoagland is a disciple of
the football game as it is played
across the divide. College men
throughout the East and Middle
West who have learned a great
deal about gridiron sport in 'the
other land' by the time the enthus
iastic Princeton man gets through
singing the praises of players,
coaches, and students at the Pacific
Coast universities.
"Nowhere, except in the East
where the 'Big Four' plan their
climax games, are such crowds at
tracted by football contests as are
seen at San Francisco. The novel
ty of seeing women in white duck
costumes and fluffy silks, without
wraps, and men wearing spring
suits at u game of football is rather
more than an Eastern varsity foot
ball man expects. . . . The
East and Middle West have no
monopoly on organized cheering
and rooting. California and Stan
ford have developed some of the
greatest rooters ever seen outside of
the big Eastern fields. The songs
of the multitude are a feature that
provokes merriment even among
the men who are accustomed to
'Old Nassaw,' 'Fair Harvard,' or
'Here's to Good Old Vale.' Califor
nian cheering is devoid of harsh
criticism of opponents. It is meant,
as it should be, entirely to encour
age the members of the teams of
the respective sides to greater
efforts.
" \i have been asked many times
since my return whether or not the
men who play football at these uni
versities are sufficiently advanced
in the game to make elevens in
Eastern varsities', continued Mr.
Hoagland. 'I should answer in
the affirmative, and would name as
examples of of Far Western brawn
and intelligence,Traeger and Seeley,
linemen of Stanford, and liaitt,
quarterback of the same team;
Pringle (captain), Smith, and
Gammon of the California eleven.
These players would have little
trouble in making any of the var
sity elevens I have seen play in
1900. In Smith, California has as
good a ground-gaining back as
there is wearing a moleskin today.
Then there is Frank Slaker, whose
work on the University of Chicago
championship eleven of 1899 is still
the talk of the football world. He
is playing his old position for Stan
ford, and continually gives the'col
lege men exhibitions of great line
bucking.'
"Time and time again enthus
iasts have tried to get the football
authorities on the Coast to play
post-season games, but the trainers

have maintained that it would he
a physical impossibility to keep
men in condition there any more
than they could he kept 'onlage'
at Yale or Wisconsin. lowa's elev
en resumed training the other day
on the report that the Hawkeyes
were to go to San Francisco and
Los Angeles to play post-season
games, hut while the men were
frisking about in the chilly air, the
students out on the slope were bask
ing in the sunshine and studying.
'"No university could better re
pay its men for the arduous work
of the gridiron season in the Mid
dle West,' continued Mr. Hoag
land, 'than to permit them to take
a trip to the Pacific ocean during
the holidays. The era of goodfel
lowship and thorough sportsman
ship that has spread over the slope
would be appreciated by tfie boys,
and the minds of the students
would be broadened by what they
saw. It is too bad from a sports
man's point of view than an eleven
made up of as good fellows as those
who wore the cardinal of Wiscon
sin and the old gold of lowa could
not have been sent West this
winter.'"
