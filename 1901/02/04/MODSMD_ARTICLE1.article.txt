# STANFORD VICTORIOUS.
## Varsity Defeats Firemen's Fund Team in a Hard Game of Baseball. 
### 
The handful of spectators who
defied the cold to see the baseball
game Saturday were more than re
paid for their trouble by being
treated to as fine an exhibition of
the national pastime as has ever
been seen on the campus. The
game was very stubbornly contes
ted from start to finish, the Varsity
turning defeat into victory by their
heavy stick work in the ninth in
ning, and pulling the game out of
the lire by the score of 10 to 9.
But the score only tells half the
tale. The spirit showed by the
men of fighting until the finish
when they were three runs behind
gives more reason to be hopeful
than does the number of runs, bits,
and pot-outs.
Captain Edwards perhaps de
serves the most credit for the sur
prisingly good showing made by
the team. The pace that he set in
hitting, base running, and fielding
made the rest of the team give the
best that they had in order to keep
up. Misner played a pretty game
at second, accepting his three
chances without an error. Con
nors, who has not been able to at
tend the practices, played as well
as could be expected, and gives
promise of becoming one of the
fastest men on the team when he
has reached his best form. Cow
den held the lirst bag down in
beautiful style and led the team in
hitting. He is one of the most re
liable men we have at the bat.
The out-field, consisting of Sy
monds, Ball, and Lowenthal,
played errorless ball. The long
throw in to the plate made by Ball
after catching a high fly, and
Symonds' catch up against the
fence were features of the game.
But the surprise of the day was
the wonderful work done by our
battery made up of new and inex
perienced men. Bennett and Par
ker showed Varsity form in pitch
ing. only ten scattered hits being
made from their delivery. Besides
this, each struck out three men.
Bennett had good control,while Par
ker was somewhat wild, but the
Firemen found it difficult to con
nect with his speed. With a little
more practice both these men will
make first-class twirlers. Horn,
who was still weak from his recent
illness, started the game behind
the bat and was very gritty, but
his strength gave out and Treager
was putin to finish the game.
Treager's work with the mask and
mit exceeded the highest expecta
tions of either the coach, the play
ers, or the spectators. His work
was far better than anything he
has done in practice, and placed
him easily in the lead of the candi
dates for backstop honors. He had
not been in the game more than a
few minutes when two of the Fire
men were retired by his fast arm,
and the only reason why more of
them were not put out was that
the high respect which they had
for his whip prevented them from
attempting to steal. He also han
dled Parker's speed with suc
cess.

For the Firemen, J. Hammond,
Webber, and Moskimon played the
best game. Moskimon pitched
steady ball and hit well. J. Ham
mond was a good backstop and
Webber piled up three hits to his
credit.

The handful of spectators who
defied the cold to see the baseball
game Saturday were more than re
paid for their trouble by being
treated to as fine an exhibition of
the national pastime as has ever
been seen on the campus. The
game was very stubbornly contes
ted from start to finish, the Varsity
turning defeat into victory by their
heavy stick work in the ninth in
ning, and pulling the game out of
the lire by the score of 10 to 9.
But the score only tells half the
tale. The spirit showed by the
men of fighting until the finish
when they were three runs behind
gives more reason to be hopeful
than does the number of runs, bits,
and pot-outs.
Captain Edwards perhaps de
serves the most credit for the sur
prisingly good showing made by
the team. The pace that he set in
hitting, base running, and fielding
made the rest of the team give the
best that they had in order to keep
up. Misner played a pretty game
at second, accepting his three
chances without an error. Con
nors, who has not been able to at
tend the practices, played as well
as could be expected, and gives
promise of becoming one of the
fastest men on the team when he
has reached his best form. Cow
den held the lirst bag down in
beautiful style and led the team in
hitting. He is one of the most re
liable men we have at the bat.
The out-field, consisting of Sy
monds, Ball, and Lowenthal,
played errorless ball. The long
throw in to the plate made by Ball
after catching a high fly, and
Symonds' catch up against the
fence were features of the game.
But the surprise of the day was
the wonderful work done by our
battery made up of new and inex
perienced men. Bennett and Par
ker showed Varsity form in pitch
ing. only ten scattered hits being
made from their delivery. Besides
this, each struck out three men.
Bennett had good control,while Par
ker was somewhat wild, but the
Firemen found it difficult to con
nect with his speed. With a little
more practice both these men will
make first-class twirlers. Horn,
who was still weak from his recent
illness, started the game behind
the bat and was very gritty, but
his strength gave out and Treager
was putin to finish the game.
Treager's work with the mask and
mit exceeded the highest expecta
tions of either the coach, the play
ers, or the spectators. His work
was far better than anything he
has done in practice, and placed
him easily in the lead of the candi
dates for backstop honors. He had
not been in the game more than a
few minutes when two of the Fire
men were retired by his fast arm,
and the only reason why more of
them were not put out was that
the high respect which they had
for his whip prevented them from
attempting to steal. He also han
dled Parker's speed with suc
cess.

For the Firemen, J. Hammond,
Webber, and Moskimon played the
best game. Moskimon pitched
steady ball and hit well. J. Ham
mond was a good backstop and
Webber piled up three hits to his
credit.
The detailed score was as fol
