# DR. JORDAN'S ADDRESS.
## The 						President Gives a Pleasant, Straightforward Talk on "Character-building." 
### 
An exceedingly kind and inform
al address was delivered Sunday
evening in the chapel by Dr. Jor
dan. It was honest and helpful
and was highly appreciated by
those who heard it. President
Jordan said in part:
"The topic I shall choose is as
old as knowledge, as old as col
leges; I shall call it 'Concerning
Certain Elements in Character
building.' This iv the greatest
work that the college does; it is all
the church is concerned with. But

they cannot go directly at it. The
college teaches by studies that
there is a vast deal of difference
between doing work well and do
ing it badly. Men are practically
the same in after life that they are
in college. Men to be good law
yers must be good lawyers when
they enter the bar. Men will be
the same in legislatures that they
are in college politics.
"It is true that some men change,
men who were bad becoming good;
and, of course, some men who have
ability become failures in after life.
It is of the change of character for
the better that I shall speak.
When some decided change takes
place it is due to one of two causes:
will power, or training in religious
affairs. It is hard to settle down
after a life of debauchment; the
roots of a man's wild oats sink in
to the spinal cord. But it can be
done, and if I were asked some
definite thing to do, I would say
that this can be accomplished by,
first, doing the best thing you can
see to do, and, second, by saying
'No,' by resistance. No man or
woman will amount to anything
who cannot say no. Any pretence
in anything you do not under
stand or believe is hurtful to char
acter. The education of the char
acter does not consist in learning.
The things that influence a man are
what he preaches to himself.
Every tendency in man is primar
ily good and the wrong in them is
in their perversion. There are cer
tain powers which are made strong
er by our use of them. Thase form
higher heredity. Hunting for
pleasure is simply the following of
the natural tendencies of the mind,
but going too far. We are too
lenient with ourselves. We should
look our weaknesses squarely in
the face; it will be a life and death
struggle with us to crush them.
The'sins which so easily beset us'
are the ones from which we should
be saved. Evil is in choosing the
second-best. Vice consists of short
cuts to happiness. The love of
getting money for nothing is the
root of all evil. Gambling is a
short-cut to wealth, as drink is a
short-cut to happiness.
"Doing things for a low motive
is ruinous to character. Some
men do unworthy things to catch
the cheap flattery of women. This
is mutual immorality. Many good
men are turned out of their courses
by the applause of the galleries.
This is the great temptation of col
lege men. They lose finally the good
old Puritan consciousness which
is the most precious thing in all
America today. Self-control is
the best thing a man can learn.
When you kill an enemy inside
you its power goes into you.
"One of the important things in
life is that little things prepare us
for the great things which follow.
Men must be able to "sacrifice the
present pleasure to the future good.
The habit of 'swiping' things forms
one of the elements of future em
bezzlements. Another of the temp
tations which easily beset us is the
habit of saying what is not strictly
true. Try never to get into such a
position as will make you to do
mean and sneaking things. Col
lege should teach men to go 'head

on,' to face dangers. The habit of
doing things because others do so
is a cause of much sin. The habit
of faithlessness between men and
women is a small and mean hy
pocrisy, as is also the shamming of
religious efforts. Virtue must he
natural or it becomes sham and
superficiality. Let us learn to say
No, and to do the best thing we can
when the time comes to act."
