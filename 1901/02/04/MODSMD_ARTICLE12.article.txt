# "OPPOSITE RELIGIOUS VIEWS."
## Rabbi Voorsanger Delivered an Interesting Address Sunday. 
### 
The Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger of
Temple Emanu-El addressed a large
audience in the chapel yesterday
morning. His sermon was drawn
from the thirteenth chapter of
Isaiah, in which the prophet fore
tells Babylon's destruction. He
was as usual interesting and elo
quent. Extracts from the sermon
are as follows:
"Judaism and Christianity de
rive their faith from divine revela
tion; but even a stupid must at
times descend from the high prem
ises which theology has established
and look upon facts from an evolu
tionary view. Religions grow, de
velop, and the development of this
revolution was something awful; it
was a marvel. Humanly speaking,
I cannot see how antiquity could
be overthrown. England is no
more powerful today than was
Egypt of old. There probably is
not yet such an industry as Egypt
had, and the super-excellent civili
zation of Babylon reached beyond
a time into which we cannot pene
trate.
"The moralist looks upon things
from an ideal point of view, as they
ought to be from the highest point
of excellence. He can not see the
necessity of evils. Who could
have thought that Rome could fall?
Yet with all the luxury of the
world in her lap even then in the
second century Christians and
Jews looked upon her glory with
horror. External power may de
velop while degeneracy goes on; it
is possible, but when civilization is
merely external it will topple over.
Roman civilization was merely ex
ternal, and because it had no
heart, it fell.
"Christianity is not merely an
ideal confession of the unity of
God as opposed to Paganism; it is
a confession that condemns all
views of old times. It is a religious
system, like Judaism, that com
mands every man to bold himself
under certain restraints, that es
tablish the unity and peace of so
ciety. The canker of antiquity
was immorality; it was external,
not internal, civilization. The
profits were to light the bonfires
that lit the world.
"Both Christianity and Judaism
are very unpopular religions. It
is natural that they should be, for
they would elevate the mob, de
nounce the politicians, and de
maud a clean life from every man
and woman. Paganism, however,
is very popular; it is beautiful, it
is easy. Up to the sixth century
it was a very popular religion; and
so long as it encourages the self
willed and vicious tendencies of
earth, so long it is popular.
" 'Thou shalt not,' â€”this is the
greatest revelation of Judaism and
Christianity; it is the message of
Isaiah and of Jesus; it is the mes
sage of the moralist of today.
"But Christianity has not much
of a chance after the tendency to
ward Roman civilization has
taken such a firm hold on the na
tions. Let us not be fools enough
to fall back upon the past. We
are heirs to a hundred civilizations.
Ancient nations were powerful, but
they fell. Let us rather by ex
ample show that Christianity is
the consecration of every life to
high ideals imbedded in the moral
schemes of the prophecies. 'Holy
shall ye be, for holy am 1, your
God."'
