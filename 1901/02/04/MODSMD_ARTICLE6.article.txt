# Y.W.C.A. Meeting.
## 
### 
The Young Women's Christian
Association held a very pleasant
meeting Friday evening at the res
idence of Dr. O. L. Elliott on Al
varado row. Owing to the inclem
ent weather there was not a very
large attendance and much of the
business was therefore postponed
until the next meeting. Eight new
members were received. Several
changes in the constitution were
discussed.
After the business meeting, re
freshments were served, games
played, and a very enjoyable even
ing spent.
