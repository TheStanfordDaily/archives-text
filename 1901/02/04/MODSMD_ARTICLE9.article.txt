Last semester by the conscien
tious work of our football men and
the encouragement given them by
the student body, we won both in
tercollegiate events. This semester
we have men who are working con
scientiously both on the diamond
and on the track, but the interest
of the student body seems to be
dead. No one except those who
are trying for the teams seems to
care whether we win or lose. Sat
urday, during a game full of bril
liant plays, the Stanford yell was
not given once by way of encourage
ment, and the team was not given
as much support as a second-rate
"prep" school usually gives to its
teams. There is either something
wrong or we must confess that
Stanford spirit is a thing of the
past. The main trouble seems to
be that every one thinks that some
one else is to blame and that his
individual support does not make
much difference. When a great
number begin to hold such views,
the result is knocking and indiffer
ence. It is to be hoped that every
body will realize the existing con
ditions and consent to perform
their duty by doing all in their
power to encourage those who
make it possible for us to celebrate
victory and look with pride on our
athletic history.
