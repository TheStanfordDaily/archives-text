We venture today to make a
sugggestion to the University au
thorities, which although probably
destined to remain on the faculty
shelves until the student millen
ium, we hope will receive some
show of consideration. Our con
tention is that every debater who
wins a place on an intercollegiate
team should receive University
credit therefor. This plan is not a
new one. It has been agitated un
officially from time to time, and
the reason for dwelling on it at
this juncture is that it is brought
sharply under our notice by the
approaching Carnot contest. The
Palo Alto has long maintained
that its staff should receive some
such recognition as this, and has
exploited the subject at various
times. But for the present we are
willing to waive personal claims
and bury our own interests under
those of the more deserving. The
services of a debater do not receive
their just recompense. Scholar
ships are not available, sweaters
are not considered entirely appro
priate, and pins, although better
than nothing at all, are mere baga
telles. The only reward that seems
wholly applicable is credit for col
lege work. Any man who has ap
peared in a Varsity debate will
testify —and the faculty members
who have aided him will corrobo
rate his statements —that more
solid grinding hours are put into
his preparation than into any
three-hour course in the catalogue.
And he will further assert that the
benefits derived have been fully as
great as those of any three-hour
course. We do not realize what an
enormous quantity of work these
men have to do before they appear
on the platform. We are willing
to accord them our momentary ap
plause when they win and condole
with them when they lose, but of
the hours of preparatory grinding

we give no more than a passing
thought. It is a little thing to ask.
Scholastic integrity is not involved.
In justice to our debaters and to
the University, this mutual and
long-delayed recognition of services
is due.
