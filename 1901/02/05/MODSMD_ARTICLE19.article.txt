Editor Daily Palo Alto:
We do not presume to criticise
those in authority, for there may
be, and no doubt are, circumstances
we know not of, which result in the
present condition of the walks
about the quad. Nor would we
insist that a knowledge of the facts,
whatever they are, would improve
the quality of the walking or de
crease the noisy bark of a cold.
But when, in order to reach En
cina Hall from the Library, as
happened this (Monday) evening,
we have to elevate our trousers
halfway to our knees, there is a
something in human nature that
seems to make a "kick" most op
portune.
Is it to increase our patriotism
by affording us an example of Ve
netian life that ponds five inches
deep (by actual measurement) are
tolerated on the highway to En
cina? Or is it to inculcate a feel
ing of our civic duty by a knowl
edge that next year we may by our
influence help dispose of such evils
elsewhere? if so, why subject the
girls in Roble to a condition with
which they can never cope? Or is
it, perhaps, to overwhelm us with
a feeling of our helplessness, in
that we may kick and "go hang"?
The spectacle of a man with two
loads of cinders for a walk one
hundred yards long, to which we
were forced to submit one day last
month, could only have been to
insult us. It was too farcical to be
earnest. It reminded us too much
of the old practical dodge of trying
to furnish some man a "job" to
have men serious.
In the absence of a knowledge of
whatever causes the seeming
apathy of "to whom it may con
cern," we would suggest that the
condition parallels that related of
the old Arkansas farmer. A trav
eler seeking shelter from the rain
in the farmer's rickety shanty
asked the old man why he did not
patch the holes in the roof through
which torrents of rain were pour
ing. "Well," was the answer,
"When it rains I can't, and when
it don't rain, I don't need to."
Stripped of its verbiage, this is a
"kick" against being forced to
wade through water to our shoe
tops in order to reach the hall.
The man and his two loads of cin
ders are evidence that the evil is
appreciated by whoever put him to
work. The present condition of
the walk is evidence that the job
was poorly done, and I think my
statement will be corroborated by
every Encina man. Senior.
