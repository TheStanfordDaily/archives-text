						Cloud-Burst.

### 
Last night at about ten o'clock a
severe cloud-burst occurred in the
hills back of the Cooksey house,
though it was not raining on the
campus at the time. A torrent of
water came pouring down the
gully beside the county road and
flooded a portion of Lasuen avenue
and several cellars to the depth of
three or four feet.
