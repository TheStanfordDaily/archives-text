We are often apt to underesti
mate the importance of interclass
contests, but it is very important
that the interest in these events
should he kept up. Interclass
games have a double object. First,
they are the only means which re
main for us to keep up the old class
spirit, which has tended to disap
pear since the rush has been abol
ished. Second, they often bring
out men who would not have taken
part in athletics at all unless the
chance of making a class team had
presented itself. This season we
shall see at least three men on the
Varsity baseball team who were in
duced to play baseball simply in
order to help their class teams. In
order to make the most of our op
portunities, therefore, all those who
think they have possibilities should
come out for the class teams, and
the classes themselves should take
an active interest in the games and
give us a demonstration of that
good, wholesome class rivalry
which was so prominent in '9b and
'97.
