The proposal from the Univer
sity of California for an intercol
legiate chess tournament would he
under ordinary circumstances a
very wise plan. But coming as it
does at this time, when our chess
players have heen disorganized for
two years and are badly out of
practice, the challenge should be
well considered before any final
action is taken in regard to its ac
ceptance. It is not a question of
whether we win or lose, as that is
not the chief aim of intercollegiate
contests. Hut it is a question of
preparation, which takes time, and
we do not feel like attempting lo
represent our University with a
team that is out of practice, when
there is not sufficient time to round
the players into shape. It is in

deed to be regretted that interest
in chess as an intercollegiate event
should have died out. But we con
sider it extremely inadvisable to
attempt to revive it here at Stan
ford when the effort costs so much
and is in danger of proving a fail
ure in the end.
