This year, owing to several causes,
the track has not been at the dis
posal of the men trying for the
track team, but now that it has
been repaired it is in better shape
than ever before. There are cer
tain events in which men are
needed, and needed badly. Par
ticularly is this true of the hurdles.
With only one man of last year's
team to try in these events, new
material is required. For certain
reasons this form of track work is
little practiced in preparatory
schools, and is usually not taken
up by-athletes until after entering
college. It is a game in which
practice counts for everything, ho
that any man with ordinary abil
ity may excel by adhering to a
system of strict training. Dr.
Murphy would like to have all the
new men who can appear upon
the track at once for preliminary
work. The same that has been
said concerning the hurdles applies
to the weights, are men in
the University who can, and who
should make an effort in this line
of sport.
