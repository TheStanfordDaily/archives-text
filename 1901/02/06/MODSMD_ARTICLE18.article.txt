# Monitors Appointed.
## 
### 
Six Encina men have been se
lected by the Faculty Committee
to act as guardians of law and or
der in the hall this semester.
They are J. A. Bentley, '01, R. L.
Brooke, '03, C. A. Cantwell, '01,
R. S. Fisher, '02, L. E. Harter, '01,
and Chester Naramore, '03. Form
erly it has been the custom to have
two student policemen on patrol
duty, but as the roll of tenants has
increased the duties of these men
have become too onerous and hon
orless to be rightly performed by
them, hence this innovation. Pro
fessor Greene, when interviewed
this afternoon, states that these
monitors would not, as report has
had it, entirely supplant the Fac
ulty Committee in their oflicial re
lations with Encina rooms.
