Work on the new water system
is progressing slowly. All four of
the wells have been already sunk
and a receiving tank seventeen feet

means of electric motors, and the
power for these will be furnished
by the Blue Lakes Power Company.

a few days, and good water will be
on the campus by the first of July.
The work is being done under the
direction of the president of the
