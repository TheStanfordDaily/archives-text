The baseball outlook at Berkeley
this year is a bright one, though
she has lost some of last year's
best material. Thirty-seven men
are trying for the team, of whom
Overall is the most conspicuous,
as he is trying for '"Pete" Kaars
berg's positiofi in the pitcher's box.
He has so far made a very good
showing, though he has a close
second in Nourse.
As catcher, California has Smith,
who has already made a reputation
for himself in that position. For
first base, the only man who has
appeared bo far is Braly, who is
practically sure of his position if
he can be spared from third, which
would in that case be left vacant.
King will probably play second
base and Captain Hunter
short stop. In the out-field, Ham
lin will play left, and McKeown is
the only man who is reasonably
sure of one of the other positions,
which are well contested by a
number of candidates.
California has her usual confi
dence in winning the Field-Day
this year. She claims to have
track material as good as if not
better than ever before, and thinks
an excellent team can be developed
from it.
Without doubt Berkeley will
have a good tennis team this year,
although her outlook in the double
events is not very encouraging.
Her most promising men are
Braley, '01, Selby, '00, Brown, '04,
Diebert, 7 04, and McGavin, '04. Of
these MacGavin has made the best
showing. R. G. Hunt will prob
ably not play this year on account
of his work on the Blue and Gold.
In a week California will begin her
interclass tournament of singles
and doubles.
