# READY FOR THE CARNOT.
## Preparation Completed for the Contest with California.—Positions Chosen.—Seating Arrangements 
### 
Tomorrow night in the Assembly
Hall will take place the seventh
annual debate of Stanford and Cal
ifornia for the medal of Baron de
Coubertin. During the seven years
that have lapsed since the event
was inaugurated Stanford has won
the decision but once, and that in
1895, when the first debate occured.
The winner at that time was R.
L.Sandwick,'9s. The Cardinal rep
resentatives have invariably given
a good account of themselves in the
intervening contests,and last season
the most equitable way of arriving
at a decision would have been by a
toss of the coin. This year we have
a trio of debaters any one of whom
is capable of capturing the coveted
prize. At Berkeley, where they are
confident that theirs is the best team
tin ned out by either college, every
effort has been put forth to add
one more medal to those Califor
nia already possesses.
The question to be debated, as
previously announced, is " liesol ved,
That French administrative law is
incompatible with the spirit of a
democratic republic." According
to the rules of the contest, each
speaker is allowed fifteen minutes,
to be divided as he thinks best,
provided that not more than
half the time be given to his last
speech.
The Stanford speakers are
all experienced debaters. Two of
them faced a Berkeley audience in
the Carnot last year, and the
other, while never having appear
ed on a Varsity team before, has
proved his mettle in class and col
lege debates.
John Frank English, who will
speak first on the negative, is a
senior and registers from San
Francisco, where he prepared for
college and won debating honors
at the Lowell high school. As a
sophomore he made his victorious
class team in the debate with the
Freshmen, his two colleagues at
that time being (he same as those
of this contest. He made last sea
son's Carnot, and also the finals of
the Intercollegiate. He is a Law
major and a member of Philolex
ian.
Cecil Mortimer Marrack, second
on the negative, is also a senior
and registers from San Francisco.
He prepared ;it St.i Matthew's. His
debating career at Stanford com
menced with his entering Eu
phronia Literary Society and ap
pearing on the Sophomore team in
the debate with '02. Last year he
made both the Carnot and Inter
collegiate, contributing much lo
our success in the latter event, and
making the decision in the former
a matter of perplexity to the
judges. He is an English major
William Alfred Morris, who is
the third debater on the affirma
tive, is a senior and a major in
History. His home is in Salem,
Oregon, where he prepared at Wil
lamette University. He was also a
member of the '02 team in the
Sophomore-Freshman debate, and
appeared in the finals of last year's

Intercollegiate. He has made won
derful progress in stage presence
and argument since his first ap
pearance. Like Marrack, he is a
member of Euphronia.
The second speaker on the affirm
ative will be Wiliiam B. Greeley, a
senior at Berkeley, who prepared
at the San .Jose High School, and
went to U. C. after spending a year
at Stanford. He was a member of
last year's Carnot team and is
president of the senate at Berkeley.
He is a member of the Delta Upsi
lon fraternity.
Leon E. Martin, third on the
negative, is now a junior at Berke
ley. He debated in the Berkeley
High School, and was president of
the 1902 debating society as a
freshman. He is a brother of W.
M. Martin, last year's Carnot
medalist.
J. H. Steinhart, leader of the af
firmative, is a senior at Berkeley,
and, like Martin, makes his initial
appearance in intercollegiate de
bating at this time. He is a grad
uate of Lowell High School, San
Francisco, where he was a promi
nent debater. Last semester he
occupied the speaker's chair in the
Students' Congress.
The alternate for Stanford is
Albert Newton Merritt of Del Bey,
111. He is a senior in Latin and
has taken his A. B. degree at Bat
tle Creek College. He made the
finals of last year's Intercollegiate.
Ralph S. Pierce,'ol, is Berkeley's
alternate. He has been prominent
in the Students' Congress.
Seating arrangements have been
made whereby it is intended that
the faculty, Stanford students, and
Berkeley delegation shall have sec
tions to themselves. The first ten
rows to the right of the center on
the main floor will be reserved for
the California contingent. Across
the aisle, on the left of the center,
ten rows will be set apart for fac
ulty members, and directly behind
the faculty will be the space de
voted to the Stanford rooters. One
section in the balcony, that to the
right of the middle section, will
also be reserved for Stanford peo
ple. No seats will be reserved after
7:30, except those in the Berkeley
section. The debate commences at
8 o'clock, doors open at 7. Dr.
Jordan will preside and M. C. De
carli, '01, will act as timekeeper.
It is an interesting and some
what annoying fact that the posi
tions of the debaters as drawn by
mistake yesterday were almost the
exact reverse of those drawn today.
To Marrack fell the first affirma
tive, unquestionably the most ad
vantageous position, as it gives him
the opening and closing speeches.
Morris's place was second affirma
tive, and English's third negative,
both of which are regarded as bet
ter positions than those thev now
hold.

lamette University. He was also a
member of the '02 team in the
Sophomore-Freshman debate, and
appeared in the finals of last year's

Intercollegiate. He has made won
derful progress in stage presence
and argument since his first ap
pearance. Like Marrack, he is a
member of Euphronia.
The second speaker on the affirm
ative will be Wiliiam B. Greeley, a
senior at Berkeley, who prepared
at the San .Jose High School, and
went to U. C. after spending a year
at Stanford. He was a member of
last year's Carnot team and is
president of the senate at Berkeley.
He is a member of the Delta Upsi
lon fraternity.
Leon E. Martin, third on the
negative, is now a junior at Berke
ley. He debated in the Berkeley
High School, and was president of
the 1902 debating society as a
freshman. He is a brother of W.
M. Martin, last year's Carnot
medalist.
J. H. Steinhart, leader of the af
firmative, is a senior at Berkeley,
and, like Martin, makes his initial
appearance in intercollegiate de
bating at this time. He is a grad
uate of Lowell High School, San
Francisco, where he was a promi
nent debater. Last semester he
occupied the speaker's chair in the
Students' Congress.

has taken his A. B. degree at Bat
tle Creek College. He made the
finals of last year's Intercollegiate.
Ralph S. Pierce,'ol, is Berkeley's

Seating arrangements have been
made whereby it is intended that
the faculty, Stanford students, and
Berkeley delegation shall have sec
tions to themselves. The first ten
rows to the right of the center on
the main floor will be reserved for
the California contingent. Across
the aisle, on the left of the center,
ten rows will be set apart for fac
ulty members, and directly behind
the faculty will be the space de
voted to the Stanford rooters. One
section in the balcony, that to the
right of the middle section, will
also be reserved for Stanford peo
ple. No seats will be reserved after
7:30, except those in the Berkeley
section. The debate commences at
8 o'clock, doors open at 7. Dr.
Jordan will preside and M. C. De
carli, '01, will act as timekeeper.
It is an interesting and some
what annoying fact that the posi
tions of the debaters as drawn by
mistake yesterday were almost the
exact reverse of those drawn today.
To Marrack fell the first affirma
tive, unquestionably the most ad
vantageous position, as it gives him
the opening and closing speeches.
Morris's place was second affirma
tive, and English's third negative,
both of which are regarded as bet
ter positions than those thev now
hold.
Tomorrow night in the Assembly
Hall will take place the seventh
annual debate of Stanford and Cal
ifornia for the medal of Baron de
Coubertin. During the seven years
that have lapsed since the event
was inaugurated Stanford has won
the decision but once, and that in
1895, when the first debate occured.
The winner at that time was R.
L.Sandwick,'9s. The Cardinal rep
resentatives have invariably given
a good account of themselves in the
intervening contests,and last season
the most equitable way of arriving
at a decision would have been by a
toss of the coin. This year we have
a trio of debaters any one of whom
is capable of capturing the coveted
prize. At Berkeley, where they are
confident that theirs is the best team
tin ned out by either college, every
effort has been put forth to add
one more medal to those Califor
nia already possesses.
The question to be debated, as
previously announced, is " liesol ved,
That French administrative law is
incompatible with the spirit of a
democratic republic." According
to the rules of the contest, each
speaker is allowed fifteen minutes,
to be divided as he thinks best,
provided that not more than
half the time be given to his last
speech.
The Stanford speakers are
all experienced debaters. Two of
them faced a Berkeley audience in
the Carnot last year, and the
other, while never having appear
ed on a Varsity team before, has
proved his mettle in class and col
lege debates.
John Frank English, who will
speak first on the negative, is a
senior and registers from San
Francisco, where he prepared for
college and won debating honors
at the Lowell high school. As a
sophomore he made his victorious

that time being (he same as those
of this contest. He made last sea
son's Carnot, and also the finals of
the Intercollegiate. He is a Law
major and a member of Philolex
ian.
Cecil Mortimer Marrack, second
on the negative, is also a senior
and registers from San Francisco.
He prepared ;it St.i Matthew's. His
debating career at Stanford com
menced with his entering Eu
phronia Literary Society and ap
pearing on the Sophomore team in
the debate with '02. Last year he
made both the Carnot and Inter
collegiate, contributing much lo
our success in the latter event, and
making the decision in the former
a matter of perplexity to the
judges. He is an English major

tive, is a senior and a major in
