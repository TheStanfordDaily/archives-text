Almost every college paper in
the United States has published
the following note: "Leland Stan
ford University is considering the
matter of opening the library on
Sunday." So many exchanges
printed it last semester that we
thought it would be given a rest
now. This delusion was dispelled,
however, by our seeing it in three
of the papers which came through
the mail this morning. We had
never heard the matter spoken of
here and, through curiosity, asked
Librarian Nash about it. He said
that this was news to him, as he
had not even heard the subject
mentioned. Inquiry at the Presi
dent's office brought forth a flat de
nial of its having ever been consid
ered. Another college note of the
same caliber that is going the
rounds is that the University of.
California is about to build a
$2,000,000 gymnasium. This one

was probably started by a type
setter making a mistake in the
number of ciphers, but how the
first one could have originated is
more than we can imagine.
