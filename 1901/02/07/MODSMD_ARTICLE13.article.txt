# Praise for "Chappie."

### 
Stanford's comic paper, the
Chaparral, has not only been
achieving success at home, but in
other colleges it lias made a name
and place for itself. Iu the ranks
of the professional papers, too, it
has held its own; witness the fact
that Life used one of the "Fables
for the Worldly Wise" in its ex
change column.
The Berkeley Occident has this to
say: "If everything else we received
from the hands of Stanford were
as acceptable as the Chaparral, we
would have nothing but terms of
endearment for our 'hated rival.'
The paper is bright, breezy, ai.d
brimful of fun. The jokes really
make you laugh, the editorials are
to the point and cleverly written,
and the art work is a revelation.
Keep it up Chappie, you are all
right."
The following letter from the
Pennsylvania Punch Bowl, the
humorous publication of University
of Pennsylvania, is self-explai a
tory:
Editor Chaparral:
Dear Sir â€”As honest admirers
of your excellent paper, which we
are free to state is the best of its
kind in the country, the Punch
Bowl would be happy to exchange
with your publication. This is not
flattery but sincere praise of what
we believe is, in every way, tlie
most artistic paper among the col
leges. H. T. Craven, Editor.
From these words from abroad,
and from the paper's success at
home, it can be seen that Stanford
has reason to be proud, and the
editors of the Chaparral much
cause for self-congratulation.
