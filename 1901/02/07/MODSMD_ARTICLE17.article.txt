# Electric Power for the Campus.
## 
### 
Some time ago the electric plant
at Redwood, owned by the Red
wood Peninsular Lighting Com
pany, was purchased by the Blue
Lakes Power Company. The
plant at Redwood is now in process
of alteration and will be made a
transforming station and the power
will be transmitted directly from
the big power-house at Blue Lakes.
The current, which is of high volt
age, will be transformed at Red
wood from a power of 40,000 volts
to 5000 and at the transforming
station in the edge of the arboretum
to 2000 volts. A storage battery is
being placed at San Jose and this
power will be available in emer
gencies for University lighting.
The Blue Lakes Power Com
pany's station is one of the largest
in the United States and the power
gen 3r a ted there supplies Stockton,
Bakersfield, San Jose, and Red
wood, while a large cable goes di
rectly to Oakland. The current,
which is carried on aluminum
wires, travels 180 miles before it is
returned to the central station.
