# The 						Stanford Gymnasium Club.
## 
### 
The members of the new Gym
nasium Club met yesterday even
ing in the Encina gymnasium. A
constitution was presented for con
sideration, and after a short discus
sion was adopted with but slight
variation. The object of this club,
as defined in the constitution, is to
promote physical development and
to attain excellence in gymnastic
exercises. No person is eligible to
membership who is not attending
the University, and who is not up
to the standard of excellence as es
tablished by the members of the

organization. As new members
must be elected by a unanimous
vote of all the members, this stan
dard will necessarily be a high one,
and to this extent the membership
is limited. The officers of the club
are two, a president and a secre
tary, who will lie elected at the
first meeting of every semester.
The president appoints four mem
bers to compose an athletic com
mittee with himself as chairman.
These men shall be selected with
especial reference to their abilities
in the various departments of box
ing, wrestling, tumbling, and gen
eral apparatus work; as they will
represent the heads of these de
partments and will provide a pro
gram for each meeting. The pres
ent membership of the club is nine
teen and several new men will
probably be taken in at the next
meeting.
