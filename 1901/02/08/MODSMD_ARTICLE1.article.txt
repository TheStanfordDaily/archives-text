# THE
						MEDAL OURS
## The
						Seventh Carnot Contest Ends in a Cardinal Victory. Morris the Winner. 
### 
Once more a Stanford debater
holds the medal of Sadi Carnot.
Before an audience that packed the
Assembly Hall and was lavish of
applause for every speaker, friend

or foe, William Alfred Morris of
Salem, Oregon, put forth an un
puncturable argument and an
overwhelming rebuttal that puts
him in the front rank of college de
haters.
The question, "Resolved, That
French administrative law is in
compatible with the spiritof a demo
cratic republic," was difficult of
conveyance in all its phases to an
audience not thoroughly familiar
with the politics of France, but the
speakers handled the subject skil
fully, and made the arguments a
matter of interest even to the unin
itiated.
The contingent of Berkeley root
ers came down two hundred strong
on an afternoon special, and the
badinage exchanged between them
and the Stanford section was lively
as of old. The Blue and Gold sup
porters were heavily out-numbered,
but they strove manfully and suc
ceeded in winning the applause, if
not the good will, of a partisan
audience.
The debate was opened by J. H.
Steinhart of California, the leader
of the affirmative. He outlined
the question fairly, but left many
loopholes in his argument which
English of Stanford, the next
speaker, readily took advantage of.
The two main points of the argu
ment were concerned with adminis
trative and with democratic law.
The first of these he viewed accord
ing as it lays the stress on the
individual. The administrative
law in France, he declared, fails to
bring local self-government, and is
inconsistant with democratic
ideals. It is not in control of the
people. Law is the reflection of the
administration itself, and the
courts do not protect the indi
vidual
The first of the Stanford trio to
appear was .1. K. English, who
opened the debate for the negative.
The strong arguments which Stein
hart had put forward he under
mined one by one, besides present
ing a strong side of his own. The

trend of the speech may be gleaned
from these extracts:
"The private citizen in any
country must be guaranteed pro
tection against the government.
That is, there must be some way
to control the government. There
are in general three ways in which
to do this —judicial, legislative,
and administrative, all of which
exist in all countries but in very
different degrees.
"We all know that within the
United States the citizens' rights
are guaranteed chiefly by the ju
diciary. We are not surprised,
then, to find comparatively little
legislative or administrative pro
tection accorded the individual
But are we justifiable in conclud
ing that the same should be true
in all governments? Turning to
France we find the citizens' rights
guaranteed chiefly by an adminis
trative and legislative control,

and hence should not be surprised
if there is a corresponding lack of
judicial influence.
"Now there must be a reason
why judicial control predominates
in the United States, administra
tive control in France. The
United States is an isolated coun
try, involved in few European com
plications. There is, therefore, no
very great need for administrative
efficiency. But with France it is
different, for she is surrounded by
active enemies and is necessarily
concerned with the affairs of all
Europe. Hence administrative
efficiency is of primary importance,
and, therefore, administrative con
trol of the government, rather than
judicial, predominates.
"French experience has shown
that the decisions of the admin
istrative courts have been more fa
vorable to private rights than
those of the ordinary courts. Ad
ministrative courts guarantee pri
vate rights better than do ordinary
courts, because it is easier, less ex
pensive, and less formal, for a pri
vate citizen to hold the govern
ment official to account in admin
istrative court, than in an ordi
nary court.

"To conclude, then, the very ex
istence of the French republic de
pends upon a nicely adjusted gov
ernmental mechanism, and that is
why administrative and legislative,
rather than judicial, control pre
dominates. We ask the gentleman
whether self preservation is'incom
patible with the spirit' of any form
of government? And we have seen
that private rights are protected
rather than violated as a result of
French administrative law."
Following English came W. B.
Greeley of U. C., second on the af
firmative. He was the only veter
an on our opponent's side, and his
speech was fully in keeping with
his record. He placed the greatest
stress on the absence of a strong
judiciary in France, which he said
is the root of the greatest political
evils. A strong judicial system is
the safeguard of the masses, and is
essential to a nation's life. With
out it there iH ceaseless menace, no
check on possible violent action,
and no assurance of ultimate
national success. The courts of
America are strong because the
government feels their power; of
France are weak because this in
fluence is lacking. •
Cecil M. Marrack, who followed
Greeley, was Stanford's second
speaker. He supported the nega
tive. Opening with some very
pertinent rebuttal, he proceeded
to erect a well-nigh impregnable
bulwark of argument, delivering
his speech with easy forcefulness.
"The spirit of a democratic re
public," he said, "demands that
the scales shall balance in favor of
the people —that they shall have
the ultimate authority.
"The gentlemen of the affirma
tive maintain that French admin
istrative law is incompatible with
that demand —that where French
administrative law exists the ul
timate authority is not with the
people but with the government.
Let me emphasize this affirmative
position. In attacking the French
system the gentlemen must carry
their argument to its logical con
clusion. It is not sufficient to lay
down certain theoretical ideals of
democracy to test the justice of ad
ministrative law and infer that be
cause administrative law bears the
ear-marks of human creation it is
therefore incompatible with the
spirit of a democratic republic.
We of the negative do not main
tain that administrative law is
theoretically and ideally perfect.
By its very nature even in America
administrative law grants to the
government certain rights over the
people, and yet the gentlemen
would not say that our adminis
trative law is incompatible with
the spirit of a democratic republic.
"By far the most important con
sideration in this debate is this:
That the power of the Chamber of
Deputies over the administration
secures the ultimate supremacy of
the popular will.
"This means that no matter what
is the tendency of the administra
tion, the people are in the last anal
ysis the rulers of France.

"In conclusion, honorable judges,
we must remember that the spirit
of a democratic republic demands
that the ultimate authority rest
with the people. We do not deny
that French administrative law is
imperfect, but we do most emphat
ically deny that it robs the people
of France of this ultimate authority.
The contention of the affirmative is
too large to be proved by theoreti
cal speculation or eloquent refer
ence to our own sacred institutions.

They must take into account the
governmental forms of France, and
they must not forget that the
French administration, and conse
quently French administrative law,
are subject to the will of the French
people."
Following Marrack came VV. A.
Morris of Stanford, who upheld the
third affirmative. His masterly re
butal of his collergue's points was
a feature of the contest, as well as
the finely balanced arguments he
put forth in his own behalf.
"The gentleman of the negative,"
he said, ''has just placed before us
a most glowing picture of French
administrative law. It is true, lie
admits, that it does not protect in
dividual liberty to the extent which
he could desire, but his fears are
all quieted when he finds that the
French ministry is responsible to
the French Chamber of Deputies
and he reasons that in consequence
of this everything must be thor
oughly democratic, and the rights
of the citizen must find the most
ample protection. We are not so
easily satisfied and should like to
have the gentlemen produce one
case. The question now under con
sideration is not whether French
administrative law must be in ac
cord with the spirit of democracy,
but is it in accord with that spirit?
"The gentleman who has just
spoken fails to recognize the fact
that where individual rights are
supreme we have democracy and
where governmental prerogative
is supreme we have despotism.
The first part of his speech he de
votes to emphasizing the individ
ual and the second part to empha
sizing the government. No man
can serve two masters, nor can any
nation serve two masters.
"It is administrative law which
decides cases involving the viola
tion of individual rights by govern
ment. Let us inquire in deal
ing with such cases whether it
is compatible or incompatible with
the spirit of a democratic republic.
