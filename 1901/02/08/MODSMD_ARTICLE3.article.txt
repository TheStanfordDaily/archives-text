another semester the new water
works for the University will he in
running order, there comes a feel

give expression to the satisfaction
it feels on account of the promised
improvement. It is to be hoped,
however, that the usual "unavoid
able delay," so common in campus
affairs, will not be present in this
instance to again disappoint us.
