livia. Mr. Simons has been in
South America for some time col
lecting fish and other animals for
the British Museum. Many of bis
captures have also found their way
to the Zoological department here.
He flays that last fall he hired a
Peruvian guide who robbed him

of his money and entire outfit at

Mhotgun and a mule. When the
scientist found his faithless servant
later, there was a light, ending
with Simons being thrown into
