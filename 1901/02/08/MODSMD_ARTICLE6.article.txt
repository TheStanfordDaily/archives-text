An invitation has been received
from the University of Pennsyl
vania to send a team East to take
part in its seventh annual inter
collegiate relay race meeting on
Saturday, April 27th. There will
be three races to determine the col
lege championship of America, and
they will be open to all the colleges
in the United States and Canada.
One race will be for a distance of a
mile, each man to run a quarter
mile. The second race will be a
four-mile race, each man to run a
mile. The third race will be a two
mile-race, each man to run a half
mile. The University of Pennsyl
vania will be found in all three,
with prospects that Harvard, Yale,
Georgetown, University of Chicago,
Michigan, and others will also
enter.
On account of the distance and
the consequent great expenss it
will probably be impossible for
Stanford to consider the invitation.
