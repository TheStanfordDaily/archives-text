# STANFORD WINS.
## Varsity Defeats Santa Clara in a Baseball Game Full of Errors. 
### 
With most of the men out of
form on account of lack of practice,
the Varsity succeeded in defeating
Santa Clara at their home grounds
Saturday afternoon in a baseball
game full of errors by a score of 9
to 5. The bad weather of the last
week prevented practice on the
diamond, and good fielding was
hardly to be expected. Stanford,
however, had a decided advantage
in batting, their hits being made at
critical times. Santa Clara was
weak both in fielding and batting,
and from present indications she
will not have a team that wiil com
pare favorably with her teams of
former years.
For Stanford, Cowden played,
perhaps, the best game. His arm
was strong and accurate, and his
batting was good. He is now lead
ing the team in hitting. Connors
was in good form, accepting his
seven chances without an error.
Traeger caught a fair game, but he
was unable to control his throwing.
Symonds, Ball, and Lowenthal
played errorless ball in the out
field. Ball and Lowenthal also
did some good work at the bat,
each tearing off two hits. Parker
and Palmer pitched good ball,
holding Santa Clara down to eight
hits.
Strube on second base and Karry
sit short-stop played the best game
for Santa Clara. Keefe pitched
first-class ball the first part of the
game but he was unable to keep up
his speed.
The detailed score is as follows;
