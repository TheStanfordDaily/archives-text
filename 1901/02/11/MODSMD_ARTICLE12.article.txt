The outcome of Friday evening's
debate, besides being tbe source of
endless gratification to a confident
student body and a well-nigh dis
couraged alumni, calls fortb two
pertinent conclusions. The first
of these is that our debating sys
tem, hitherto but an experiment so
far as individual contests are con
cerned, has proven its right to be con
sidered a success. Experience has
been somewhat bitter, but the way
now seems clear. Henceforward, v\e
may expect our debaters to assume
an offensive instead of a defensive
attitude. The second point is that
this seems destined to be a Stan
ford year. Last season we courte
ously split even with California,
although somewhat loath to do it.
But circumstances are different
this year. Starting out as well as
we have, it would be a pity to let
victories within grasping distance
slip away. The winner of the
medal, in the course of remarks be
fore his literary society the other
evening, voiced this sentiment: "If
1 were asked to give a Stanford
toast now, 1 should propose some
thing like this: 'Freshman game,
Thanksgiving game, Carnot, Inter
collegiate, baseball, tennis, and
track —may this be a Stanford
year.' " While unwilling to be ac
cused by our Berkeley friends of
lusting after everything in sight,
we heartily second this toast.
Everyone who can —and this means
every student, man or woman —
get into the fight., and help in mak
ing this season's record one of un
broken victory.
