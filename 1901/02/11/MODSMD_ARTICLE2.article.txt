# Sophomores Win from Freshmen.
## 
### 
The game beween Sophomores
and Freshmen was a very lop
sided exhibition oi ragged baseball.
Errors on both sides were very nu
merous and gootl plays were very
scarce. Even the men who have
been playing on the Varsity seemed
to go to pieced. The Freshmen
were unable to make the game
interesting, the Sophomores win
ning from start to finish.
The Sophomores easily out
classed the Freshmen, in the first
two innings of the game scoring
five runs, while the Freshmen were
unable to hit the ball and made er
rors at critical times. In the third
Luce went to first base on an error
and scored the first run for the
Freshmen on a wild throw by Tra
eger. in their half the Sopho
mores were retired with three men
on bases without a score.
The next two times at bat the
Sophs increased their lead by four
while the Freshmen were unable to
bring a man home. In the sev
enth the Freshmen took a brace and
scored two runs, but the Sophs in
turn added two to their end of the
score. The Sophomores went to
pieces in the eighth and the Fresh
men scored three times.
The rooters came down from the
grandstand and matters began to
look bad for the Sophs, but theii
lead was too great and the game
closed 11 to 6 in favor of the
Sophomores.
The pitchers worked well on
both sides but they were not given
any support. The game as a
whole was unsatisfactory even as a
class game.
