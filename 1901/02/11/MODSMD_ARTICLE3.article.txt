# Christian Association Notes.
## 
### 
The meeting last Sunday even
ing, led by Harter, was well at
tended and interesting. Rev.
Chas. H. Caton spoke briefly, tak
ing as his subject, "Love Thy
Neighbor as Thyself." Hull,
Thomas, and Miss Hammond also
spoke.
A large number of Christian
Association hand-books still re
main. The Association urges those
who have not yet, obtained a copy
of this little volume to apply at
the Registrar's office before the
supply is exhausted.
