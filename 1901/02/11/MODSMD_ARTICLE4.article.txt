## All Teams Training Hard for the Coast Championship Event. 
### 
The first trial run of the Olym
pic Club occurred yesterday in
Golden Gate Park, the men being
taken over a two-mile course. Six
men in three teams of two men
each were started two minutes
apart. The next trial will be run
next Sunday and the team will be
chosen Monday.
Teams from the Oakland High
School and the Academic League
are also hard sit work and may
surprise the older runners. It is
rumored that Berkeley has with
drawn from the contest, having no
runners yet in condition.
The Stanford team hsis been run
ning for some time and has done
good, steady work. Zschokke,
Chadbourne, and Hamilton are
practically sure of their places on
the team, while for the other two
positions the choice will lie be
tween Taylor, Lewis, Thomas, llol
man, El kins, and Sprague. The
first try-out will probably occur
Thursday afternoon in the arbor
etum. Captain Stewart will take
his men to the city Saturday and
get them acquainted with the
course.
Zschokke's work is to all who
have seen it the surprise of the
season. His endurance always
was great, his wind is remarkable,
and his long, swinging stride will,
it is believed, easily kill off all com
petitors. Captain Stewart is de
lighted with his ability.
Chadbourne has done good, ef
fective work since the first of the
year, and will doubtless help very
materially in bringing the Olympic
cup to Stanford.
\V. R. Hamilton, the winner of
the mile run at the last field-day,
is in good condition and, with his
remarkable stride and wonderful
finish, is picked for a sure winner.
