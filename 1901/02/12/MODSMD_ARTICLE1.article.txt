# JUNIORS VICTORIOUS.
## They Defeated the Seniors in an Exciting Baseball Game This Afternoon. 
### 
The game between the Juniors
and Seniors this afternoon was a
very interesting and exciting con
test, although the play was often
loose and ragged. The Seniors be
gun the scoring in the first inning,
bringing two men home. The
Juniors failed to score in the first,
but made up for it by scoring six
in the second. The Seniors were
unable to pull themselves together
in the third inning, and the Juniors
increased their lead by two, the
Seniors failing to score. Palmer
seemed to have the Seniors at his
mercy in the fourth and retired
them in one, two, three order. In
their half of the fourth the Juniors
unraveled Bennett's curves and
brought home another tally, mak
ing the score 9 to 3.
The next inning the Seniors be
gan to connect with the sphere, but
the side went out after one tally.
By some good playing on the part
of the Seniors, the Juniors were
prevented from scoring. Both
teams failed to score in the sixth.
The Seniors made an attempt to
rally in the seventh. With two
men out, Swindells passed to first
on balls and scored on Bentley's
hit, but no more runs scored, the
final score being 9 to 5.
The teams were very evenly
matched, and hut for the fireworks
in the second inning would have
been very close. Palmer did much
to win the game for the Juniors,
pitching a good, steady game. Ben
nett at times seemed to go to
pieces.
