We have in college certain ath
letes who have not been able to ex
cel in any of the four branches of
athletics which the University
fosters, yet who are nevertheless
skilled in their particular line of
sport. These are the men who
play handball. We suggest as an
incentive of work in this line a
series of interclass games, with
some suitable prize for the winners.
It is probably but the matter of a
short time until there will be inter
collegiate contests in handball, and
it behooves us to encourage the
sport now. If a sufficient interest
is aroused the student body may
be induced to erect a suitable court
for the use of players, at least when
the training-house is built if not
before.
