It has been the custom for some
of the departments in the Uni
versity to hold field-days between
themselves and also to participate
in inter-department baseball games.
This custom should be fostered t<>
the greatest degree, for men who
would compete in one of these
meets would not enter the regular
try-out. In this way many men
are discovered who otherwise would
never don a track suit. In the
field-day between the Engineers
and allied Geology and Chemistry
departments last year no less than
a dozen men competed who should
make the Varsity this year, and it
was observed at that time that
some of the men would be future
point-winners. The practice of
holding such tests should bespread
to other departments, and the
meets should be brought off earlier
in the year so that athletes show
ing promise may be induced to
train for spring games.
