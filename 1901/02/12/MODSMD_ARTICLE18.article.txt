# Tomorrow's "Sequoia."
## 
### 
The new Sequoia, out tomorrow,
will open with the first chapter of
an historical story of early Wash
ington by Mildred Stanford. Iwo
very short and very clever stories
are by H. M. Lewis and C. M.
Stone. The Desert Island discus
sion is carried on by Dr. Stillman.
An ingenious and interesting col
lection of "Oddities in Verse" by
"Leslie Harrison" will occupy sev
eral pages. The poem by a new
Stanford writer, W. J. Stack, is a
successful use of a difficult poetical
form. The portfolio is devoted to
college incidents. The graduate
department contains a poem by
Irving Outcalt. Miss Pollock's
"Spider and Fly" gives the obser
vations of the naturalist and is
gracefully told.
