Work on the University track is
most unsatisfactory just at present,
as the poor drainage will not allow

it to dry off. There is also much
difficulty in obtaining the necessary
cinders, though there is a prospect
of having some in a few days.
A meet with the University of
Washington will probably take
place on or about May 25th, in ad
dition to meets with Multnomah
and the University of Oregon about
the same time. Arrangements are
being made for a field-day between
the University of Nevada and the
Freshman team about the middle
of April or early in May, and Ne
vada is also desirous of a return
meet with the Varsity team here.
Ukiah has challenged the Sopho
more team, and the Oakland High
the Freshman team for a meet
about the end of March. Thus
there is every prospect for a series
of interesting track meets, though
the management is much worried
over a delay in the training facili
ties and is doing its best to hurry
things up.
