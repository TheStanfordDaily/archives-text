# Sophomore Cotillion.
## 
### 
The Sophomore committee met
Friday afternoon to complete ar
rangements for the cotillion. Ow
ing to the limited number of de
signs submitted for the program
cover the time at which the compe
tition ends was extended. The
committee will consider the designs
tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock.
It was decided to have the new
march, "Cardinal Forever," by E.
Li. Flint, '00, played by the orches
tra, and to serve coffee, cake, ice
cream, and punch for refreshments.
An effort was made to change the
date of the cotillion from Friday,
February 22d, to Thursday, Feb
ruary 2lBt. Owing to the impossi
bility of securing the services of
Yanke's orchestra for that evening,
the dance will be held on the 22d
as announced at first.
