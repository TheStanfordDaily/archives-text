The February number of the
Harvard Law Review contains an
interesting article on "Future In
terests in Personal Property" by
Professor Gray of the Harvard Law
School, who is generally conceded
to be the greatest authority on
property law in this country.
This article is of particular inter
est to all lawyers and students, as
it shows a marked modification of
the views expressed by Professor
Gray in his book on the "Rule
Against Perpetuities," published
some years ago. In a note to the
article in the Review, lie gives full
credit to Professor Abbott for this
change of view, as follows:
"A main motive in writing this
article has been the hope that it
may lead to a fuller examination of
the authorities than has yet been
had. The cases on future interests
in personalty are so badly digested
that one comes upon many of them
otdy by accident. My learned
friend, Professor Nathan Abbott of
the Law School in Stanford Uni
versity, has given much attention
to the subject and 1 am indebted
to him for kindly communicating
to me the result of his exhaustive
researches in the reports of several
of the States. Jt is much to be de
sired that Professor Abbott should
complete, classify, and publish his
collections."
