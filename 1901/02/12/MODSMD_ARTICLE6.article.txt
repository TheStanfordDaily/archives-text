# DOLORES' CONCERT.
## A 						Musical Treat Promised in the Assembly Hall Tomorrow Night. 
### 
Tomorrow's concert by Mdlle.
Antonia Dolores will be a musical
treat of the highest order. Of the
great lyrists of the day no one has
a more universal reputation than
Mdlle. Dolores. Those who heard
her sing several years ago as
Madame Antoinette Trebelli were
thoroughly charmed with her ex
quisite rendering of many beauti
ful solos. Critics have declared
her work equal to that of Melba or
Nordica. In fact the Musical
Courier of New York says: "Dolores
would become far superior and
much more famous than Melba, if
she adopted opera as her career."
Her voice is brilliant, marvel
ous in range, clear, and firm of
tone and she has a fine appreci
ation of values. Her career all
over the world has attested to her
wonderful art and she has scored
successes in England, France, Rus
sia, and other European centers,
is well and favorably known in
Australia, New Zealand, and South
Africa, though most of her tri
umphs have been gained in this
eouhtry.
Stanford is fortunate in having
an opportunity to hear so great an
artist, and especially to have the
opportunity at prices just one-half
of what she regularly charges. The
advance sale of tickets so far is
good, and proves that music-lovers
here are appreciative.
Mdlle. Dolores' accompanist, Mr.
Robert Clarence Newell, is already
well known to Stanford as director
of last Year's Varsity Glee Club.
