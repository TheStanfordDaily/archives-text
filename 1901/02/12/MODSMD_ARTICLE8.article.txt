# Junior Farce Contest.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Junior Farce
Committee yesterday afternoon it
was decided to offer a prize of
twenty dollars for the successful
farce for Junior day this year.
This prize is to be for the manu
script of the farce only, and has
nothing to do with the matter of
its staging and presentation, which
will he otherwise provided for hy
the committee.
The committee reserves the right
to reject all manuscripts should
none prove suitable. It is hoped,
however, that competitors will be
numerous, and little doubt is en
tained but that a good farce will
be forthcoming.
All manuscripts should be ready
to be submitted by the first of
March as it is important that suf
ficient time be allowed for staging
and rehearsing the play chosen.
The committee is anxious to see
the farce a decided success, and
looks for the hearty co-operation of
all who are interested in stage
tters at Stanford.
