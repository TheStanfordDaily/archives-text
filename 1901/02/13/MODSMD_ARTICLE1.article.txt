# TUESDAY NIGHT LECTURE.
## Prof. Ames Speaks on the Feature of Handwriting Relating to the Detection of Forgeries. 
### 
Professor Daniel L. Ames, expert
in handwriting, addressed a large
audience in the chapel last night.
He has had much experience in
detecting forgeries, and much of
his evidence has been of great im
portance in litigations. He spoke
mainly on that feature of hand
writing relating to the detection of
forgeries, and to assist his remarks
he had circulars with printed speci
mens of writing placed into the
hands of his hearers. By way of
introduction he said:
"1 speak of an unfamiliar phase
of penmanship, the scientific in
vestigation of handwriting, that
phase of it invoked in litigation,
what is termed forgery.
"Some consider that there is very
little in thisscientific investigation,
that no decided conclusions may
be reached.
"What is handwriting? It is
the ability to write by careful imi
tation, and includes both study and
practice. Writing by school chil
dren, or a learner is impersonal, in
the degree of its conscious imita
tion. The changes that come into
the hand after the ability to write
has been gained constitute indi
viduality; until writing becomes
thoughtless and habitual it is im
personal.
"The instant a pupil enters up
hand unconsciously, and each
change until the handwriting is
firmlv established as an adult
hand constitutes his personality.
He cannot depart from it.
"Many of the deviations from
the standard types are so small as
to be microscopic, and to this mic
roscopic deviation many a failure
is due. The force of habit which
lies in a set of muscles is strength
ened by writing, which no amount
of willing can overcome. No one
can know all the minute person
alities of his own hand, nor can he
understand the minute personalities
of the handwriting he would re
place. If he did know he could
not by simple will reproduce it,
nor could he entirely iay aside his
own hand. The work of an expert
is to approximate as nearly as pos
sible the peculiarities of the two
handwritings under comparison,
to determine how far the forger has
forgotten himself and injected his
own habit in the spurious writing."
Professor Ames ended his talk by
illustrating copiously from the
charts and explaining the points
which led to the discovery of forg
eries in many prominent litiga
tions, among which were the cases
of Cadet Whittaker at West Point
and the Craven-Fair will contest.
