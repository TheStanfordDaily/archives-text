The path of the editor of a daily
newspaper, even if lie edits only a
college daily, is not strewn with
roses. Everyone knows better
than he does how his paper ought
to he run. Since taking possession
of the sanctum of the Daii.y Pai.o
Alto six weeks ago, we have been
slowly learning how true this is.
One person says we print too many
quads, another too few; and thus
criticisms extend to every depart
ment of the paper. Just now the
Chaparral is up in arms against
the Christian Associations and
therefore calls us to task for pub
lishing news of their doings and
giving long reports of sermons and
speeches. "The Daily Palo Alto
is a student body enterprise and
should, in our estimation, repre
sent every part of it, and not con
fine itself to one phase. We have
selected our staff with this idea in
mind. A perusal of the names at
the head of this column will show
that the table contains representa
tives of every class of students
here. We hope, with such a staff,
to publish a paper in which every
person in this University can find
something to interest him or her.
If we fail in this, then, so far as
we are concerned, the paper is a
failure, if we succeed, we are sat
isfied and care not what anyone
else has to say about it. If the
paper were published simply for
the enjoyment of the editor of the
Chaparral and his clique we would
fill the first page with baseball and
the second with "knocks." But
since we do not cater to their tastes
alone, we try to publish also things
of interest to others of the student
body.
