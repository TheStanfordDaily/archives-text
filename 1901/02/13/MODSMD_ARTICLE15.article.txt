Mr. S. C. Simms, assistant cura
tor Field Columbian Museum,
spent yesterday at the University
and museum. He deplores the in
difference shown by the majority
of the students of Stanford in rela
tion to the museum, compared with
the Eastern universities, where each
student makes it a special point
during the summer vacation to ob
tain some object of interest for the
local museum. If this practice was
followed here, it. would not be long
before the museum would bave one
of the finest ethnological depart
ments on the Coast.
Carl Philbrook has moved from
Encina to the museum, thus mak
ing three instead of two staying in
