# Carnot Judge Pleased.

### 
President Jordan received the
following lettsr yesterday from one
of the gentlemen who acted as
judge of the Carnot debate:
My dear Sir: —In the semi-confus
ion attending the awarding of the
Carnot medal on last Friday night,
I fear that 1 omitted to adequately
express to you my appreciation of
your personal courtesy and of the
other provisions that were made
for me. 1 desire to do so now, and
to extend my thanks to you
and those others who looked after
me, and especially for the oppor
tunity that made me one of the
judges of the debate. The experi
ence was one that I shall always
look back to with great satisfac
tion. The young men, I thought,
handled a difficult subject, under
the limitations of time imposed
upon them, with much ability.
All of the judges, 1 think, were
greatly impressed with the absence
of anything approaching oratorical
ranting on the part of any of the
speakers, and with the closeness
with which they stuck to the sub
ject. This quality of mind spoke
volumes for their training, and
retfects great credit on themselves
as well as their instructors. My
previous general impression of the
utility of such contests was greatly
enhanced by listening to the
speakers. Lt is certainly a great
advance in oratorical discussion
over anything I was familiar with
while in college.
Again thanking you for your
kindness, I beg to remain,
Yours very truly,
Carter P. Pomeroy.
