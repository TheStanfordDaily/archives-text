# Challenge from Washington.
## 
### 
A challenge to a debate between
a team composed of Stanford men
and one formed of debaters from
the University of Washington will
probably be received in a few days
by the Debating Committee here.
It is rumored that the University
of Washington will pay all Ihe ex
penses of our team. The scheme
lias as yet met with little opposi
tion and will probably be success
fully carried out.
