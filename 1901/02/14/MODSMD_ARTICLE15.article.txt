# Encina At Home.
## 
### 
Final preparations for the En
cina dance were made at a meeting
of the directors last night. Vari
ous duties were assigned to the
members of the reception and dec
oration committees, and it was de
cided to have live pieces of Yanke's
orchestra furnish the music.
This "at home" promises to be
the most successful one given this
year. Light refreshments will be
served, and the room will be artis
tically decorated with red lights
and evergreens.
