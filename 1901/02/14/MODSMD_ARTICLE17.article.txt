—A comparison of the roll of
cities now with that at the time of
our first census, in 1790, discloses
Home strange mutations of fortune.
Jn 1790 the fourth city in the
United States was Charleston,
South Carolina, now the sixty
eighth. The seventh was Salem,
Massachusetts, now the one hun
dred and tenth. There were only
six cities of over 8000 inhabitants;
not even a village west of the Al
leghanies had a place on the census
roll, and even in the East there
was no Jersey City, Newark, or
Washington. — Saturday Evening
