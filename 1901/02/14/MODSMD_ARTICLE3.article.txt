# Cross-Country Try-Out.
## 
### 
Candidates for the cross-country
team have been instructed to he at
the training house at 2:30 p.m. to
morrow. The run will take place
on the track at the stock farm at
3 p.m. Mr. Frank Covey, the
manager of the farm, has kindly
had the track put into the best
possible condition, and has pro
vided dressing and rubbing rooms.
The men will probably be sent off
in bunches of three and each man's
time taken. The five runners who
make the best time will constitute
the team. Just how many men

will run tomorrow is not definitely
known, but it is rumored that sev
eral more beside those heretofore
mentioned will compete for places.
Among these might be named
Hawley, Bristow Adams, and
Nangle, who, it is reported, have
been training faithfully but quietly
for some time. After the team has
been selected each man will be
measured* for his jersey. A sample
arrived Tuesday and, judging by
this, the trophy will be worth the
struggle. The jersey is light,close
ly woven and full-bodied, with full
length sleeves and a buttoned col
lar. On the right side is a Ger
man S with the letters C 0 below
it. The garment is of the college
cardinal, and the letters are white.
Captain Stewart will probably take
the team to the city Saturday to
look over the course, which extend*
through Golden Gate Park from
the beach to Baker street. While
in the city Manager Oilman will
order spiked shoes for the track
team. The try-out tomorrow will
be made in tennis shoes.
