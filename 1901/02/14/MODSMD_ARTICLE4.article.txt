### 
Stanford athletes have been
asked to compete in the college
sports at the Pan-American Expo
sition to he held in Buffalo. It is
intended to make this part of the
fair one of its chief features, 'l'he
commiteee in charge has already
sent circulars to the leading Amer
ican colleges for the purpose of
drawing to the exposition as large
and as good an athletic representa
tion as possible. A stadium with
a seating capacity of 12,000 will he
built, and promises to be one of the
chief architectural creations of the
exposition.
As to the nature of the athletic
events planned, it may he said that
amateur sports of all kinds will be
encouraged as representing the
most desirable of athletic competi
tions, and the members of the com
mittee on sports, being college
graduates, particularly wish to
make a spectal feature of college
sports. In the management of in
tercollegiate events, it is the desire
of the committee that the various
college associations be invited to
undertake as far as possible the ar
rangement of the necessary details
connected therewith.
Although amateur sports will
comprise a large part of the pro
gramme, it is proposed to have
such a number of professional
events as will allow visitors.an op
portunity to witness the athletic
skill of the best professionals.
it is proposed to arrange a num
ber of college baseball and football
games, and it is especially desired
by the committee that the Eastern
intercollegiate (i. A. A. A.) track
meeting he held in Buffalo this
year.
The committee on sports hope
that the exposition may have a
full college representation. It is
proposed to hold many other sports
in the stadium, the A. A. U. cham
pionship, lawn tennis, la crosse,
cycling, Association football, water
sports, and trap and target shoot
ing.
All communications should be
sent to Jesse C Dann, Chairman,
