# MDLLE. ANTONIA DOLORES.
## The
						Famous Singer Was Greeted by a Small but Very Appreciative Audience Last Evening. 
### 
A lamentably small audience
greeted Mdile. Antonia Dolores last
night, hut it made up in apprecia
tion what it lacked in numbers. It
was unfortunate that a mid-week
date and a disagreeable night
should have militated against as
good a house as so great a singer
deserved.
When Mdlle. Dolores first ap
peared, it seemed impossible that
so great and much-heralded a
singer should be so unassuming.
This characteristic marked the
whole concert, an entire lack of af
fectation, po√üe, and the vocal gym
nastics one naturally associates
with the ordinary concert singer.
She sang as a bird sings, freely,
easily, and without effort, so much
so that one wondered how she
could reach her highest note with
never a sign that they were any
different from any others.
It is impossible to distinguish be
tween the various numbers for ex
cellence, but if one # could distin
guish, the"Ave Alaria"from Mascag
ni's Cavalleria Rusticana seemed
quite the best, though it is hard to
compare its dramatic power with
the lilting sweetness of many of her
little French chausonettes. liiget's
"Tarantelle" and Lee's ''Away,
Away" particularly brought out
Mdlle. Dolores' marvelous flexibil
ity of tone.
After the last number on the
program, in response to repeated
encores by the still waiting audi
ence, she sang her famous "Laugh
ing Song," thus bringing out to the
full the wide range of her reper
toire, from its airy sweetness to the
depth of pathos found in the "Ave
Maria."
Mr. Newell's accompaniments
were always thoroughly sympathet
ic, and his own numbers on the
program were extremely well ren
dered. His characteristics are
skill in interpretation and a phe
nomenal accuracy of touch, both
of these being brought out particu
larly in two spinning songs by
Pachulski and Mendelssohn.
