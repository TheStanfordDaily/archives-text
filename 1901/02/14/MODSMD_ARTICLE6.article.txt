### 
I)r. Goebel of the German de
partment has received a letter from
the manager of J. J. Archibalds
asking if he could arrange a lecture
before Stanford students. Mr. Ar
chibalds is the eminent war corres
pondent of the Boer war and is now
lecturing throughout the country.
The University authorities have
no power to bring him here,
as there is no lecture bu
reau; and if an opportunity is
given to hear him it must come
from some student organization.
There is probably no greater au
thority today on the Boer war than
Archibalds, and it is hoped that
some arrangement can be made to
bring him here.
