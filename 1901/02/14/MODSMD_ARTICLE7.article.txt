# Freshman Class Meeting.
## 
### 
The Class of 1904 met in the
chapel at 1:15 this afternoon to
consider the matter of paying for
the Fresh man sweaters. In calling
the meeting to order President

\\ ood stated that the sweaters had
been ordered without the consent
of the class, and that Manager Gil
dersleeve had congratulated Roehr,
the president at that time, 011 the
fact that the student body had
paid the bill.
The question was thrown open
for discussion, and a heated de
bate followed. Lock wood opposed
the matter on the ground that the
custom of the classes' settling for
sweaters won in intercollegiate con
tests was not a good one. But
realizing the unpleasant conse
quences attending a refusal, he
moved that the bill be paid under
protest. Noland seconded the mo
tion. McFadden held that Gilder
sleeve as manager of (he Freshman
team had authority to order sweat
ers, but as manager of the Varsity
team had no authority to pay for
them, lie moved to strike out the
protesting provision in the first
motion. The amendment was sec
onded by Chandler, but was lost on
the first ballot; the orginal motion
was then carried with few dissent
ing votes.
In reply to AthleticMa-nager
Henley's enquiry as to bis author
ity, Mac Donald offered an amend
ment. to the constitution to the ef
fect that no bill over $10 should
be paid by the treasurer without
the consent of the executive com
mittee, and that this committee
should report to the class at the
end of each semester. The amend
ment was carried.
