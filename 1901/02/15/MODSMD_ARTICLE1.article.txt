# BILLS BECOME LAW.
## Stanford Measures Receive Governor's Signature.â€”Fees May be Abolished. 
### 
A telegram wan received by I'res
ident Jordan this afternoon read
ing thus: "Governor has ap
proved the two Stanford hills," and
signed hy J. 11. Nourse.
Thus was the legislative battle
begun two years ago in the Assem
bly, re-fought before the voters of
California last fall, and finally de
cided by Governor Gage's signature
after a handsome majority had
been given by both houses. The
text of the tax-exemption bill is as
fol lows:
"Section 1. The University
buildings of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, situated in the
county of Santa Clara, State of
California, used for university
purposes, and all bonds held, or
thai may be held by the trustees of
such University in trust for the
benefit of such University, shall be
exempt from taxation, provided
that all these properties, real or
personal, held in trust for the ben
efit of such University, shall be
subject to State, county, and mu
nicipal taxation; and provided
further, that while this act is in
force no fees shall be charged resi
dents of this State for tuition at
such University, hut such tuition
sha 11 be entirely free.
"Section 2. This act shall take
effect m; its passage."
The companion bill, which
grants to the trustees corporate
powers and privileges, reads as
follows:
"Section 1. The trustees of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
are given the right* to exercise cor
porate powers and privileges, and
to that end they may organize and
act as a board of trustees, elect such
officers of such board as they may
deem to be necessary, adopt by
laws, and as such board and through
the officers thereof they may trans
act such business and perform
such acts and exercise such powers
as they in writing may provide
may be transacted, performed, and
exercised by such board. Such
board may adopt a. seal which
shall read' 'Seal of the L. S. J. U.,'
and such seal when attached to
any document or writing shall be
prima facie evidence that such doc
ument or writing was made by and
under due authority from such
trustees. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to alter the tenure or limit
the power or obligation of such
trustees."
Section 2. Same as Section 2
above.
Both bills were introduced by
Senator Cutter.
The essence of the tax-exemption
act is that the buildings of the
University proper and the personal
securities held in shape of bonds
will not be subject to taxation
hereafter The property held in
trust, such as the stock farm, vine
yards, and Stanford residence, are
not exempt.
A feature that particularly con
cerns the students is that under
the terms of the act registration
and other fees are likely to be done
away with.
