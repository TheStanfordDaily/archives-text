Tomorrow the Varsity baseball
team plays its first game in San
Francisco, and judging from the
conscientious work which our men
have been doing on the diamond
we can rest assured that they will
make a creditable showing. We
cannot hope to have a great num
ber of students present, but all
those who have an opportunity
should attend the game and give
our team all the support possible.
The season has opened auspicious
ly with two victories to our credit
and it depends upon the interest
taken by the student body whether
or not this winning pace shall be
kept up.
