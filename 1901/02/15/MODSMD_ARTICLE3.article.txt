A number of students who are
interested in literature met at Miss
Pearson's last night for the purpose
of forming an organization that
would tend to bring the literary el
ement of the University together,
much as the science students are
in the Geology and Zoology clubs.
It was unanimously decided that
such a club was desirable, but there
was considerable difference of opin
ion as to what its aims and limita
tions should be. Mr. Seward of the
English department gave an out
line of a club of similiar purpose
that is in existence at Columbia.
A committee of five was selected to
adopt a provisional plan of organi
zation consisting of the following:
Misses Heywood and Webster, and
