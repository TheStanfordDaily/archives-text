## Practice Resumed Last Night.—Varsity Plays Fireman's Fund Tomorrow. 
### 
Baseball practice was resumed
yesterday after a lay-off of about
a week, and the men seemed none
the worse for it. The most en
couraging feature of the practice
was the improvement which the
Varsity showed in hitting. They
seemed able to get hits whenever
they wanted them. The first fail
ball which has gone out of the
oval this season was hit by Lowen
tlial over the right-field fence.
Symond, Brown, Edwards, and
Traeger also did good work with
the stick. Brown and Conner
were as fast as usual and made
some good pick-ups. Young
played a good second base and
Triteh made some good throws
from deep center field. Cowden
is holding down first base in good
style and promises to make first
base the strongest position on the
team. Traeger's arm was in good
form, and he threw well to the
biigs. Parker shows considerable
improvement in pitching. His
speed has not diminished and lie
seems to have gained control. The
second nine found it very difficult
to connect with his curves, and he
gave very few leaves on balls.
Studley was also quite effective.
As a whole the practice was very
satisfactory considering the fact
that there has been little work on
the diamond during the last week.
