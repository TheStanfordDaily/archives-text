# Tomorrow's Game.
## 
### 
The Varsity will meat the Fire
man's Fund team for the second
time in San Francisco tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30 in Recreation
Park, corner Eight and Harrison
streets. The Varsity has improved
considerably since the last game,
and as the Firemen will have
strengthened their team, a good
game will undoubtedly be played.
Van Haltren, the fast fielder from
the National League, will play
center field, and Krug, one of the
heaviest batters in the California
League, will play shortstop. The
Stanford team will be under
the disadvantage of playing on a
strange diamond. Our battery,
which was very weak the first
game, has improved at both ends
and should make a good showing.
