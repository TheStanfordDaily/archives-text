# STANFORD DEFEATED.
## Varsity Puts Up a Poor Exhibition of Baseball Against the Firemen. 
### 
Before a small number of specta
tors whose aggregate admission fees
would hardly pay for the balls
which were lost, the Varsity was
overwhelmingly defeated Saturday
by a score of 12 to 1. The Fire
man's Fund team played such ac
curate ball that even had the Stan
ford aggregation played their best
game it would have been impossible
for them to have won, but this by
no means accounts for- the great
discrepancy in the score. Stanford
played a poor game, putting about
as much spirit in its play as a lab
orer working for the government
by the day puts into his work. At
the most critical times the Varsity
seemed to lie most listless. Cap
tain Edwards tried to rally his
team, but the good example he set
was not followed.
The only run which Stanford
made was brought home in the
fifth. Parker walked to first, base,
and Edwards, who followed him,
made it easy traveling to the plate
by tearing out a clean three-base
hit. Several times after this Stan
ford's chances of scoring were
bright, but the team could not pull
together sufficiently to take advan
tage of their opportunities.
The Fireman's Fund team played
horse with Stanford in the fourth
inning, scoring eight runs and
hitting the ball at their pleasure.
Bennett had to be replaced by
Parker, and even this change did
not stop the slaughter until three
men had scored. With the excep
tion of this inning both Parker and
Bennett pitched fairly good ball.
Parker showed more of an effort to
get into every play than any man
on the team.
The Firemen began their scoring
in the first inning, bringing in a
tally on an error followed by a hit.
In the third three safe hits netted
the Firemen another run. Eight
runs in the fourth and one in the
seventh and eighth innings ended
the scoring on the part of the Fire
men.
