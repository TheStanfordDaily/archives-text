Some industrious persons have
kindly removed the posts on the
pedestrian path to Palo Alto.
They have thereby earned the si
lent gratitude of professors and stu
dents alike. The idea of placing
posts along the path was to keep
the busmen from driving on it.
But the number of broken bicycles
and the many bruises received by
riders and pedestrians have more
than offset any advantages they
may have had. It is to be hoped
that the authorities will not go to
the trouble of replacing them. We
feel certain that, if Mrs. Stanford
knew how much trouble the posts
have caused, and how dangerous
they are to life and property on
dark evenings, she would be glad
to have them removed from the
paths.
