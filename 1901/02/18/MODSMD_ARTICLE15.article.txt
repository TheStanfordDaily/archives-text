Our baseball team at present
has one fault, which has caused
much of the loose play of the last
week. The men neglect one im
portant department of the game,
namely, scientific coaching and the
"talk up" in general: Howeverun
satisfactory talking may be in
other sports, the fact still remains
that it is an essential part of base
ball, and first-class baseball is im
possible without it. Every mem
ber of the team should be ready to
use his voice as well as his muscle.
In base running, coaching is indis
pensable. A man on the side-line
can give a base runner advice and
encouragement otherwise impos
ible. Many mis-plays in the
last few games could have
been prevented by timely word
from some member of the team.
The only way that the team can
be held together is for men to en
courage and advise each other.
Every man should be in the game
when his side is at the bat as well
as when it is out. We should like

to see the team playing more as a
unit and not so much as merely
nine individuals each playing with
himself.
