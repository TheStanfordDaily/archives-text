# The 						Jaines Bill.
## 
### 
A measure of much significance
to studentß of law is now under
consideration in the California leg
islature. It was introduced by Mr.
.Jaines, of Los Angeles, and is known
as "The Jaines Bill." If carried as
amended, it will provide for a two
years' course previous to application
for admission to the bar, and the
course of study will be based upon
twenty-eight books, discussing four
teen topics. The examiners will
be given the discretion to enlarge
subjects of examination, or to sub
stitute books by other authorities
upon the same subjects. In place
of the old board of examiners
chosen from the Supreme Court,
a board is provided of three mem
bers, "one of whom shall be Dean
of the Hastings College of Law and
the other two shall be attorneys
and counselors of the Supreme
Court of this State —one of whom
shall be a resident of the Los Ange
les district and the other one a resi
dent of the Sacramento district."
That is to say, the choice»of exam
iners will be partly territorial, in
which the Dean of Hastings will
represent the State, and partly to
give law schools a voice in the ex
aminations. All examinations are
to be public and based upon writ
ten and oral questions, the exami
nations to be held annually in San
Francisco and Los Angeles. The
fee for examination is to be $15,
upon payment of which the appli
cant may have three trials. The
majority of the provisions of this
act go into force when the act is
passed, but the provisions relating
to the subjects for examination and
the methods of holding examina
tions go into effect .July Ist, 1901.
This bill is along the lines of an
act in force in New York, and it is
thought will be an improvement on
the system now in vogue.
