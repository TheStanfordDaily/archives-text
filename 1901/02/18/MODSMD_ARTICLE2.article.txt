Van Haltren was the tower of
strength on our opponents' learn.
His throwing from center field
made the Stanford men cautious
on the bags and every time he
came to bat he kept the fielders
busy handling the ball. Moski
nion and Krug were also in good
form both in pitching and fielding.
Krug's change of speed kept the
Stanford batsmen guessing con
tinually.
For Stanford, Parker, Edwards,
Lowenthal, and Brown played the
best ball. A catch by Lowenthal
and one by Brown were two re
deeming "features of Stanford's
ragged playing. Traeger was not
in his best form behind the bat,
but he will undoubtedly improve.
