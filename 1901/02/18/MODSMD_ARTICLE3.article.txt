# U.C. 24, Alumni 9.
## 
### 
In the first game between the
Intercollegiate Graduate team and
the California varsity played last
Saturday on the Berkeley diamond
the practiced college men succeeded
in running up a score of 24 against
their opponents' 9. For the first
five innings the match was even,
but Kaarsburg's arm finally gave
out and his team was unable to
cope with the outfield drives of the
undergraduates. The game was
full of errors on both sides. For
the college nine the old men made a
creditable showing. Overall, the
freshman twirler, had no control,
and was replaced by Rowland in
the fifth inning. The Stanford
men on the alumni team were
Swindells and Havens. The
score by innings:
California..6 50 2 1 70 3 *—24
Base hits 2 3 2 1 2 6 1 4 * —21
Alumni.. ..0 5 0 0 1 1 2 0 o—9
Base hits 0 2 0 0 2 1 1 1 I—B
