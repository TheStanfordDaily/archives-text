Owing to- the fitct that the rainy
weather of the past few clays has
prevented tennis practice, the pre
liminary trial tournament has
been postponed from February 23d
to March 2d. Names of contest
ants and entrance fees of twenty
live cents must be in ut 12 o'clock
February 2<Sth. The drawings will
be posted on the tennis court at
4:30, March Ist. In order to get
an idea of the relative merits of
the best players the drawings will
be arbitrary, and will be so ar
ranged as not to bring the six best
players together before the semi
finals.
As the entrance fee is only
twenty-live cents, which is partly
to pay the expense of balls, it is

hoped that all tennis players will
be out, as the Sole object of the
tournament is to give our players
some experience in playing under
tournament conditions. This is
especially important to our men,
as we have no real tournament
practice, while Berkeley students,
owing to her close vicinity to the
Californian courts, has had much
more experience in this line than
our players Brown, Selby, Me-
Gavin, and Diebert are playing in
fine form, and will furnish a Ber
keley team which will make the
intercollegiate contest very close.
