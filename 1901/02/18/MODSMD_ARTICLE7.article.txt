# The 						Encina Reception.
## 
### 
Encina Club gave a very success
ful reception and informal dance
last Friday night. The club room
was decorated with green branches
of the pepper and olive trees. The
floor had been waxed and polished
till it was in excellent condition.
The lights shaded with cardinal
produced a hazy effect, quite pleas
ing to the eye, and the whole room
was tinted with the college colors.
Everybody highly appreciated the
music. The selections were well
chosen, and encores were graciously
granted. Programs with a neat
monogram of the Club were distri
buted to all present. Dancing be
gan promptly at half-past eight
o'clock and lasted till a quarter of
twelve.
During the intermissions guests
visited the different rooms, about
fifty of which were thrown open.
In many of the rooms light refresh
ments were served.
A large number of guests were
present, including many of the
faculty with their wives. The
dance though informal rivaled
many of the class dances in its re
sults.
