It skems to us that more com
munications should he written for
insertion in Daily Palo Alto than
have been in the past. Many pro
fessors and students are brimful of
ideas on different University topics,
which they should he willing and
anxious to make public by having
them published. A college daily
should be, and is in many Eastern
universities, a connecting link be
tween faculty and students. In its
columns our superiors should lie
willing to give us advice, and the
students to tell the professors what
they consider to be grievances.
Such communications would cause
no hard feelings. They ought to
act as a cementing rather than a
repellant force. Another benetit
would lie that derived from allow
ing a track man to tell in what way
our track team can be bettered, a
debater to show where our debating
system can be strengthened, an
alumnus to give us the benefit of
his experience at college, and so on
with all who feel called upon to
criticise or help with suggestions
what is being done in college at the
present time. The name of the writ
erof every article must be known to
the editor, as he is responsible for it,
but it will not be made public by
him. Let the columns of the paper
be a forum where every man may
have his say, and Iwe respectfully
listened to.
