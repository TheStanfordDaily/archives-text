## The
						Rev. R.F. MacLaran Delivers Sunday Morning Address to Students. 
### 
The Rev. Li. F. MacLaren of San
Jose preached the sermon in the
chapel Sunday morning. He
.spoke with that lirmness and depth
which characterizes the man of
earnest conviction. What he said
might well he worth reflection and
the truth he uttered may well im
press itself deeper with each suc
ceeding thought upon it.Â®
The scripture lesson, containing
also the text for the sermon, was
the eighteenth chapter of Paul's
Epistle to the Romans, the central
thought being that of the eigh
teenth verse: "For 1 reckon that
the sufferings of this present time
are not worthy to he compared
with the glory which shall he re
vealed in us."
"This at first might seem to be
a sad theme, but the substance of
the gospel is not of suffering hut of
glory. Buffering is in each grand
heroic life; suffering is necessarily
associated with glory in this world;
no one can possibly attain glory
who is unwilling to suffer.
"Anyone who would keep out of
trouble, who would let prudence
regulate his life, will never reach
glory. Throughout the Held of
human history no monuments
have ever been reared to voluptu
aries, or to those who have kept
out of real dangerous conflicts;
they have been reared rather to
true and glorious heroes, men who
did what must be done for the good
of man and the glory of God.
"There is a marked contrast be
tween the Old Testament and the
New. The promises of God to the
old Hebrews were all of a temporal
nature. A marked advancement
characterizes the New Testament.
There never were any promises of
rest, quiet, peace, and protection
from all that might harm, in
Christ's admonitions. He says
distinctly that His disciple must
be willing to suffer danger, yea,
even death. A Christian disciple
must go on the principle that he
must suffer all that must be en
dured, and whosoever goes into the
struggle with this principle may
rest assured that God has been
absolutely true in his promise,
that 'the sufferings of this present
time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory which shall be re
vealed' in Him.
"Luther at Worms had received
the divine touch of revelation and
could not do otherwise than his
tory shows. The utterances of a
single man, prompted by divine
will, swayed the convention in
favor of the Declaration of Inde
pendence.
"On the human side these neces
sary things seem hard to do; but
wherever we find a Wendell I'hil
lipps we can trace back his elo
quence to some transformation in
bis nature which comes with the
divine touch of revelation.
"Glory comes to those who be
lieve in God; and many who have
not believed in God have in mo
ments of deepest conviction seen
Him face to face. The divine reve
lation comes to the heart. It is

then that we know tluit God is God,
Love, Omnipotence, Omniscience,
Omnipresence; it is then that He
becomes a conscious reality. The
Unseen God revealed makes
strength easy. He who feels safe
in God's embrace lias all that is
necessary to make him courageous.
"In the time of crises, the great
truths of God come out and are be
lieved by all people. On the hu
man side it may be a dangerous
undertaking to stand out for the
truth revealed, but God has or
dained certain lines of history, and
it is a fearful thing to stand up
against the inevitable.
"Blessed is he who does not count
the cost, but seeing what must he
done, does it; for the sufferings and
rewards for faithfulness in this life
are nothing as compared to the
glory that will come."
