# "QUAD" PRIZES ANNOUNCED.
## Decision in the 1902 "Quad" Contest Announced this Afternoon 
### 
The committee in charge of the
awarding of prizes for the best
poem, humorous verse, and story
for the '02 Quad made its decisions
public this afternoon. Ralph JO.
Remind, '03, was the successful
competitor in poetry, with a bal
lad, entitled "The Loveless." The
best humorous verse was submitted
by Miss Katherine Daly,'oo, Her
subject was"The Passing of the
Snaps."
There were about six stories en
tered, and the selection of the best
was by no means an easy task.
The prize was awarded to C. A.
Whitmore on "The Power of the
Press," though R. J. Sterrett's
"When the Overland Comes In"
was a close second. Sterrett's story
is a remarkably powerful and well
written piece, but does not deal
with college life and for that reason
wns not allowed the prize. "The
Power of the Press" is a college
story and is a very clever produc
tion. A sketch by Miss Anita
Perrin, '03, entitled "The Zeta Ep
silon At Home" received very high
mention. It is a bright little story
of college life.
