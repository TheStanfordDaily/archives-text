# Trip for Musical Clubs.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee this evening the ques
tion of an Easter trip for the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs will lie brought
up. Such a trip is being warmly
urged by many, and if sufficient as
surances of its being a financial suc
cess can be given, the Executive
Committee will no doubt give its
consent.
