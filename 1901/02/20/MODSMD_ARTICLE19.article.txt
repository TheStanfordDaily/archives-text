Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In response to your request for
communications on matters of im
portance to the welfare of the Uni
versity I wish to bring up a ques
tion which, although it has been
agitated for over two years, is as
yet far from a satisfactory settle
ment. 1 refer to the matter of the
University Inn. The Inn was
built to provide a substitute for
the dining-room of Encina Hall as
well as to make a convenient eat
ing place for transients and for
those students who might wish to
eat their noonday meal on the
campus in preference to going to
Palo Alto or elsewhere.
Now the idea of the Inn as a
substitute for the Encina dining
room has failed, for two reasons:
first, because, as I am informed,
the rent charged for the building
is so high that the Inn manage
ment, cannot supply a good quality

of food ut a reasonable price; sec
ond, because the management has
thus been compelled to so deterior
j ate the quality of the food in or
der to meet the demand for reason
able prices that more than half of
the two hundred students living at
Encina Hall eat either at board
ing-clubs or at boarding-houses on
the Row.
The remedy for this state of af
fairs is not hard to find. Let the
University management either re
duce the exorbitant rental charged
for the Inn, or let the student body
assume control of the Inn, and, un
der the guidance of a competent
chef, inaugurate a system of a co
operative boarding-club similar to
that which prevails at Harvard.
I am told by members of our
faculty who have spent the last
year at Harvard that the students'
co-operative boarding-house fur'
nishes good and wholesome food,
well cooked and well served, for fif
teen cents per meal, making a small
profit at that.
I have no doubt that if Mrs.
Stanford were interviewed by a
committee from the student body
she would see that the rental
of the Inn was placed at a reason
able figure, and that another year
would see Encina Hall filled to its
uttermost capacity, every man
there eating his three meals a day
with a relish that would bring bet
ter results in study than the pres
ent class of food furnished at the
Inn can possibly do.
Now this communication is not
written with a view to injure the
Inn in any way, for I suppose that
they do the best they can, consider
ing the rent charged, but there
certainly is a crying need for bet
ter eating facilities at the Univer
sity, and some agitation on the
subject might bring about a much
needed reform.
