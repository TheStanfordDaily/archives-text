# Debating- Question.
## 
### 
The question for the Intercolle
giate debate was received from
Berkeley late this afternoon. It
reads as follows: "Resolved, That
the extension of the Boer republics
is for the permanent interest of
civilization." Stanford now has
ten days to choose sides. The
choice has been left in the hands of
the Carnot team by the Debating
Committee.
