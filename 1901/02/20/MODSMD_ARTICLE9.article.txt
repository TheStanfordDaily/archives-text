# Friday's Game.
## 
### 
Arrangements have been com
pleted for the third annual holiday
game between the Fireman's Fund
team and the Varsity. Weather
permitting, the two nines will
meet on the University diamond
next Friday, Washington's Birth
day.
A special train will leave San
Francisco at 9:45 a.m., returning
after the game on the same day.
The management at the city end
are counting on an excursion party
of two hundred and fifty and have
made arrangements for that num
ber. The train will run directly to
the campus., stopping on the switch
near Encina.
Judging from the game of last
Saturday the Firemen may be ex
pected to play an errorless game.
A shake-up in the Varsity ranks is
anticipated, and for the Cardinal
the best game of the season will
probably result.
This holiday game has been very
popular in the last two years and
every effort will be made Friday to
keep up the interest. The museum
will probably be kept open during
the morning for the accommodation
of the visitors, many of whom will
see the University for the first
time.
