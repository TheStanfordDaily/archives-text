# PROPOSAL TO NEBRASKA
## Executive Committee Acts on Debating Challenge.â€”Glee Club Trip Left in Treasurer's Hands. 
### 
A full quota was present at the
meeting of the Executive Commit
tee of the Associated Students last
night. Frank Adams appeared be
fore the committee to ask the as
sociation to assume full responsi
bility of the proposed debate with
Nebraska, giving an estimate of
the expense involved and the pos
sible receipts. After a consider
able discussion it was resolved that
the Associated Students would as
sume responsibility to the extent
of one hundred and fifty dollars,
provided that Stanford be repre
sented by her Intercollegiate De
bating team; that Nebraska bear
the responsibility for a possible de
ficit of one hundred dollars, and
that the Intercollegiate Debating
Committee undertake to raise sev
enty-five dollars by popular sub
scription as they had proposed.
The committee next considered
the question of track shoes and au
thorized Manager Gilman to pur
chase spikes for all track candi
dates, keeping an account list of
the same and charging the men
full value with the understanding
that at the end of the season half
the price will be refunded to those
men having made proper use of the
spikes during the season.
The Women's Athletic Associ
ation was allowed to draw upon
the treasury to purchase two dozen
tennis balls, and for removing the
grass around the tennis courts.
The question of an Easter trip
of the Musical Clubs was left to the
judgment of Treasurer Nourse as
to its advisability.
A special meeting of the Execu
tive Committee was called at 1:15
today to allow an appeal from the
decision of the Executive Commit
tee upon the Nebraskan debate.
A very warm discussion ensued.
The committee, however, remained
firm in their opinion that the pro
posed debate would prove unsuc
cessful financially unless their
terms were com plied with.
