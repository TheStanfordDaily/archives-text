Saturday evening the teams are
to be picked which will represent
the Sophomores and Freshmen in
the annual class debate. In the
case of the first-year men the Uni
versity will have an opportunity to
judge of the results of one year's
trial of the new debating system.
Theretofore the Freshmen,havirjgno
literary organizations of their own,
have had to depend either on their
own individual efforts or on such
help as infrequent appearances on
the programs of the older societies
have given them. True, in the last
two contests the Sophomores have
been defeated, but that result is to
be attributed to their opponents' in
herent ability rather than to super
ior or equal training. But this sea
son the '04 men have had all their
hearts could desire. Unmolested
and in a society of their own they
have been fighting forensic battles
for six months, and doing the best
kind of work. For the Sopho
mores, comment is unnecessary.
Both classes are represented by able
debaters. And the contest for
places is sure to be worth the at
tention of all such as are sufiici
ently conscientious to lend en
couragement by their presence.
