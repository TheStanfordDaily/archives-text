Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The recent challenge from the
University of Nebraska has opened
the eyes of many Stanford students
to a great evil in our debating sys
tem. The object of our intercolleg
iate debates is to develop debating
talent in this University. Under
the present system at Stanford, the
same person may debate against
the same university eight times
during his college course, and the
debating honors during the entire
four years are distributed among
as few as six or seven.
This system is not conducive to
the best development of debating
talent. When the men who have
won places in the finals know that
there are three men ahead of them
and only three to be chosen, they

have little hope to win and conse
quently make little effort to do so.
The debaters secure their places
without the fierce competition they
might otherwise expect. Debating
honor ought to be accessible to all
possing a considerable degree of tal
ent. A large number of students,
who possess a great deal of talent,
never take part in debating at
Stanford simply because there is so
little hope of obtaining substantial
recognition. Stanford men do not
need cash prizes to urge them to
their best efforts, but want only the
opportunity of at some time repre
senting their University in some
intercollegiate contest.
Nebraska University, scarcely
larger than Stanford, has four in
tercollegiate debates each year and
now proposes to have live. A man
having once debated against a
university is ineligible again to go
against the same university.
About eighty take part each year
in the preliminaries, and we cannot
say that any one of their four
teams is materially out-classed by
the work of our team. If other
places were accessible at Stanford,
men would develop to fill them.
We are surprised beyond measure
at the surrender of the dignity of
Stanford University when it was
proposed to Nebraska that Stan
ford should be allowed to choose
both the subject and the side. If
it is too much work for our first
team to take part in the prelimi
naries and three' intercollegiate
debates in one year, why has it
never occurred to the minds of the
committee that there are more
than three debaters at Stanford?
It is highly improbable that Ne
braska would Bend her three best
men against Stanford, for that
would greatly weaken her chances
with Minnesota and Kansas, since
under their system a. man cannot
take part in two intercollegiate de
bates in one year.
We sincerely hope that the man
agement of intercollegiate debates
in the future will be entrusted to
those who do not take part in them,
and that if another proposal of the
kind is ever received from an East
ern university, there will be no
tacit admission of the imbecility of
Stanford. Debater.
