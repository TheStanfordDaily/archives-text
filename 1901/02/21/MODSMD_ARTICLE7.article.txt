# CROSS-COUNTRY TOMORROW.
## Stanford Runners Left Today to Prepare for Contest in Golden Gate Park. 
### 
Only three organizations will
enter teams for the run tomorrow,
those three being Oakland high
school, Olympic Club, and Stan
ford. So far Stanford is the fav
orite, as it is believed that, owing
to the constant training of her ath
letes, she can put forth a stronger
and better conditioned team. The
race will begin at the iiaker street
entrance of the Park at 11 o'clock
and will finish about 300 yards
from the start.
The teams will be as follows:
Stanford—Zschokke, Chad bourne,
Sprague, Taylor, Hamilton, and
Substitute Thomas. The Stan
ford men will wear their red jerseys.
Oakland High—Westdahl, La
Vallere, Lundy, lieffired, Clough,
and Substitute Sullivan. This
team will wear blue shirts.
Olympic —Smith, Stone, Garcia,
Killan, Taylor, and Lamont (sub
stitute). These men will be dis
tinguished by white running shirts
with the Olympic emblem on the
front.
Westdahl (Oakland), and Smith,
Stone, and Garcia of the Olympics
are looked upon as the most dan
erous men we shall meet. Every
Cardinal representative is worthy
of the confidence placed in him,
and one of the live will probably
succeed in lowering the Coast
record tomorrow. A persistent
rumor is to the effect that the run
will be made in less than twenty
four minutes. Only one Stanford
man has an official position, C. A.
Cantwell being clerk of the course.
