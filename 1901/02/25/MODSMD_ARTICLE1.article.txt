# OLYMPIC TROPHY OURS.
## Stanford Runners Made the Best Time, Winning the Cup Easily. 
### 
The cross-country run held Fri
day morning under the auspices of
the Olympic Club was easily won
by our group of five runners.
The start was made from the
Baker street entrance and the fin
ish was at a point near Central
avenue. The race was run in
groups composed of a runner from
each institution. The first group
started at 11:10 and the remaining
four at intervals of three minutes.
The teams in the order started were
as follows:
First group —Garcia, Olympic
Club; Zschokke, '01; Wesdohl,
Oakland High.
Second group —Chadbourne, '02;
Redfield, Oakland High; Killan,
Olympic Club.
Third group —Smith, '00, Olym
pic Club; Hamilton, '02; Clough,
Oakland High.
Fourth group —La Vallere, Oak
land High; Sprague, '04; Taylor,
Olympic Club.
Fifth group —Taylor,'o4; Lundy,
Oakland High; Stone, Olympic
Club.
The finishes were all very excit
ing, and the Stanford yell was
given several times. In spite of
the fact that the first group con
sisted of the supposed cracks it
made the slowest time, Garcia win
ning by a slight margin from
Zschokke ; time, 24 minutes, 37
seconds. The men were evidently
afraid of each other and did too
much jockeying instead of running
their individual race. Chadbourne
ran a beautiful race and finished
far ahead of his other two men.
The time was 23 minutes, 23 sec
onds, and he would probably have
won the time medal if he bail been
paced, as some of the other groups
were The finish of the third group
was the prettiest of all. Hamilton
was in the lead at the finish, but
Smith, '00, sprinted ahead at the
tape and won the race for Olym
pic Club by a mere foot. Sprague
surprised everybody in his race.
He finished in the exceptionally
fast time of 23 minutes, 1 2-5 sec
onds. The best time was made by
La Vallere of Oakland High
School, only two-fifths of a second
better than Sprague. Taylor won
his race by n margin of over four
yards. This gave us two firsts and
three seconds, with a gross time of
1 hour, 57 minutes, and 57 sec
onds. Oakland High School made
the gross time of 1 hour, 59 min
utes, 37 seconds; and Olympic Club
of 2 hours, 2 minutes, and 24 sec
onds.
