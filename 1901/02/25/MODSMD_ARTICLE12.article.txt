Necessity led the Sophomores to
introduce an innovation in their
class dance which other classes
could profitably adopt. It has
been a custom here to be extremely
fashionable and start social func
tions very late, and then hurry
them through and extend them
late into the morning hours in or
der to dance out the program. The
result has been that intermissions
have been cut short at the end
of the program where they
are most useful. Whatever reason
there may be for beginning dances
late in the evening elsewhere, we
think that the advantages which
would accrue from starting our
parties early would outweigh any
small inconveniences which the
change would cause. We can see
no solid reason why our dances
should not begin promptly at eight
instead of long after nine.
