The following suggestion seems
in order. There is at Stanford
considerable uncertainty us to just
what sort of thing the Varsity
sweater is; the I> S" itself is a vari
able initial, and the numerals of
class jerseys whatever they may
happen to he. It. is not desirable
that our athletes should have in
ferior equipment in any way.
Clothes do not make the track
man, or the football player, but
they have become so essential at
times that no one would go with
out them —in California, at any
rate. Now, if we use a uniform
wear, why not have the best?
Stanford Varsity sweaters are not
always tit to be compared with
those of other colleges. The "S"
on the last one, for a case in point
appeared to have been cut out of
canton flannel and put on by the
individual himself. Again, the
new cross-country jerseys are a
disappointment to anyone but a
worshipper of balanced ugliness.
Why are not these things regu
lated? We would suggest a defi
nite standard to be established,

a design of the various insignia to
he kept hy the student body. The
succeeding contractors who pro
vide our supplies have not always
cared for accuracy, or beauty. We
have seen some rather questionable
work presented and accepted.
Since a high price is paid for these
things, why not have the hest?
