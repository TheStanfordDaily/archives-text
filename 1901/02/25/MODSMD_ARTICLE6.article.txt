# INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE.
## Nebraska's Proposal Rejected. Washington Sends a Challenge to Our Team. 
### 
A plan arranging for the pro
posed debate between Nebraska
and Stanford was submitted last
Wednesday evening by the Inter
collegiate Debating Committee to
the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students. The plan
provided that Nebraska guarantee
$100 of the proposed expenditure
of $815, that the alumni contribute
$25, which was promised by Suz
zalo, that the debaters interested
raise $50 by popular subscription,
and that the remaining expense,
$140, be assumed by the student
body, to he raised by the price of
admission to the debate. The
Executive Committee, however,
would not agree to this unless our
Intercollegiate team should repre
sent us. The men on this team
feel they cannot spare the
time to consider a new question
and it would be necessary to use
the same as in the debate with
Berkeley and to give them the po
sitions that they had in that con
test. As this would be too much
to ask of Nebraska and no other
arrangement can be made, a tele
gram was sent to that university
last Friday calling the whole thing
off.
A letter was received yesterday
from Seattle, asking that a debate
be arranged between Stanford Uni
versity and the University of
Washington. It was also stated
that the northern team would be
in Oregon with the track team
sometime in May, and that, com
ing from Eugene, Oregon, to Stan
ford would considerably lessen the
expenses of the trip. The Wash
ington debaters promise that, if we
pay the expenses of their team this
year, they will bring our team to
Seattle next spring and pay all ex
penses. They desire the affirma
tive side of the question, "He
solved, That the permanent reten
tion of the Philippine Islands is
desirable." The expense of bring
ing the team from Seattle would
be about $125; from Eugene, it
would cost about $116. But this
could not be arranged until May
10th, entirely too late in the sea
son. The Debating Committee will
consider'the matter tomorrow.
The question for the Intercollegi
ate debate should read, "Resolved,
That the extinction of the Boer re
publics is for the permanent inter
est of civilization." J. W. Cam
eron, A. M. Free, H. C. Jones, H.
C. Lucas, W. C. Morrow, E. W.
Rice, and C. D. Scott have won
places in the finals by their show
ing in the semi-final contests Feb
ruary Ist and '2d. By virtue of
having made the Carnot team,
M arrack, Morris, English, and
Merrill are entitled to meet these
eight men in the finals without a
preliminary contest. The finals
occur Saturday evening, March
9 th.
