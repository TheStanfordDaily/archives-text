# JACK LONDON TO LECTURE.
## Author of "The Son of the Wolf" Will Entertain Stanford People Tuesday Evening. 
### 
Although but twenty-four years
old, Jack London of Oakland, who
lectures in tiie chapel tomorrow
evening, has come to the front dur
ing the past year and a half as
one of the strongest modern story
writers. Geo. Hamlin Fitch said
that he would rather be the author
of the "'Odyssey of the North," than
of anything elsw that has heen
written during the past ten years.
This is one of the stories in Mr.
London's hook, "The Son of the
Wolf," published by Houghton,
Mifflin & Co., which is having a
big sale. He has just written a
novel on northern life that is not
yet named. It will be published
by McClure.
All of Mr. London's stories thus
far deal with life in the Klondike,
where he went as a sailor before
the mast. He spent three years in
that region, making extensive
tramps and explorations until he
became thoroughly familiar with
it. During this time he saturated
himself with Kipling, two or three
of whose volumes he had taken
with him. Upon his return he be
gan writing, his style bearing a
strong resemblance to that of the
author of the Jungle Stories. His
tales were strong, and attention
was first attracted to his work by
their appearance in the Oveiland
Monthly. Walter Page, editor of
the Atlantic Monthly, upon seeing
them wrote to Mr. London for a
story. When he received it, he
asked for a book. Mr. London has
contributed to ail the minor publi
cations, including St. Nicholas,
Youths' Companion, Black Cat,
Frank Leslie's, McClure's, The Wave,
Ainslee's, Outing, and others. He
took a $200 prize recently in the
Cosmopolitan contest.
This remarkable young author
is entirely self-made. He was edu
cated in the Oakland high school
and attended Berkeley for about
one half year. He has been a
Socialist ever since he was twelve
years old, and was formerly known
in Oakland as the boy orator.
He is now the Socialist candidate
for mayor of that city. After his
return from the Klondike, Mr.
London married a young lady in
Oakland whom be had known for
some years, and he now has a little
daughter.
All his stories of northern life
have for a basis the strength and
energy of the Anglo-Saxon as con
trasted with the natives of the
region, or as it is shown in over
corning the obstacles of nature
which present themselves there.
