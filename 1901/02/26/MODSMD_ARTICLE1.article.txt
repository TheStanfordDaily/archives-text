# SOPHOMORES VICTORIOUS.
## They Win the Class Championship by Defeating1 the Juniors This Afternoon. 
### 
The most exciting class game
since the '01 Freshman team beat
'(JO was played by the Sophomores
and Juniors this afternoon, the
former winning by the close score
of Bto 7. The playing was loose
and careless on both sides for the
first few innings, but after that
both teams steadied down to a good
game. The Juniors never got in
the lead after the first innings, but
in the sixth they tied the score.
With only one more inning things
began to look interesting. The
rooters came down from the grand
stand to rattle the players and for
a while it seemed as though both
teams wouid go to pieces. Parker
pulled himself together in the first
of the seventh and retired '02 be
fore they could tally. The Juniors
went to pieces in the other half of
the seventh, allowing the Sophs
easily to score the winning run.
Pollard hit safe, went to second on
a wild throw, and scored on
Young's error in handling Parker's
hit to second. As the Juniors had
no other turn at the bat, the game
whs called with only one man out
and two on base. The pitching of
Parker and the hitting of Ueisler
were the features <>112 the game.
