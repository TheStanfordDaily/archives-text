## Famous Artists' Initial Appearance Before Stanford Audience Tomorrow Evening. 
### 
Stanford is a favored community
in the many opportunities which

artists, By the energy and public
spirit of various music-loving peo
ple, one of the rarest opportunites
to hear some delightful music will
be given to the public tomorrow
evening.
Mr. and Mrs. Georg Henschel,
who have been giving a series of
concerts in San Francisco, are art
ists of the highest order, and of
international reputation—present
ing delightful programs of lyric
songs and ballads in the American
and European cities where they
have sung. Mr. Henschel is one
of the foremost composers of the
day in the department of song
working, and also ranks with the
best concert pianists. Formerly a
conductor of the Boston (Symphony
Orchestra, his musical knowledge
and experience is of the widest
range. Mrs. Henschel is an Ameri
can, who as Miss Lilian Bailey de
lighted her first audiences in Cin
cinnati and Boston, where she was
a pupil of Mr. Henschel. She af
terward married her teacher, con
tinuing her study under his di
rection in London. Many of her
daintiest songs have been written
by Mr. Henschel especially for
her voice quality and compass.
This is one of unique sweetness,
delicacy, and finish —with a depth
of musical feeling and genuineness
of interpretation not often met
with among concert singers.
As a proof of Mr. and Mrs.
Henschel's true musical intelli
gence, their programs invariably
have printed upon them careful
translations of the German,
French, or Italian words of the
songs.
These famous musicians have
consented to give one of their
charming concerts on Wednesday
evening. February 27th, in the
Assembly Hall, at a price which
is one-fourth of their first San
Francisco prices — fifty cents.
Tickets on sale at the postoflice
and the Bookstore on the campus,
and at the drugstores in Palo Alto.
Every person in the community
who has any love for things beauti
ful or musical cannot afford to miss
the opportunity of hearing such
delightful artists.
The following ladies are inter
ested in this concert, and hope
that a large audience will hear the
Henschels: Mrs. Jordan, Mrs.
Branner, Mrs. Angell, Mrs. Smith,
Mrs. Starbuck, Mrs. Lathrop.
