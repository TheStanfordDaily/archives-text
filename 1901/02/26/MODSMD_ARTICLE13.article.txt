The ready response to our re
quest for communications would be
gratifying were it not embarrass
ing. Letters of heterogeneous de
scription and amazing length have
been coming in in floods, to an ex
tent that threatens to seriously en
croach on office space. While
grateful to all the writers, we would
suggest that these contributions be
made as short and concise as pos
sible. Exhaustive treatises are not
necessary when a few words would
bring out the point. Nearly three
columns of the paper would be
filled by some of the articles re
cently received, which is more than
half the available space in a single
issue. In a column there are five
hundred words, and we humbly
implore our correspondents to en
deavor to confine their efforts to
considerably less space than this.
And incidentally we would say
that communications written sim
ply for the purpose of indiscrimi
nate "knocking" will receive no
consideration whatever.
