Editor Daily Palo Alto:
in the Thursday issue of your
paper appeared a communication
regarding the Inn. It seems that
it naturally calls for some addi
tional first-hand information on
the matter. Allow me, therefore,
to make a few statements of facts,
which, incredible though they
seem, are nevertheless true.
Firstly, in regard to the rent
which the authorities charge
monthly for the use of an illy
equipped, poorly-arranged build
ing. According to the lease, it
must be paid in full for nine
months. If you will remember
that out of every week the Inn can
only do any business at all during
live days, some idea of the possi
bilities of the place can he formed
by a careful study of the Univer
sity calendar, showing that the
stagnant periods of the business
take up fully fifty days out of each
term, so that the Inn pays twice

IfiB much rent as it is worth, for
nine months, with only seven and
one-third months in which to
i\inke this rent. During the re
maining one and two-thirds
months the rent paid is simply a
gracious gift to the business-oilice.
As a matter of fact, one-half of
the Encina men patronize the Inn.
The remainder either eat in hoard
ing-clubs or patronize our rival,
Mr. Mock Chong. I do not wish
to blame these men. If they pre
fer to live in a hoarding-club, it is
their privilege. The more is the
pity that they are driven to it by
the authorities. All things being
equal, it is human nature to go
where one can get the most for his
money. Neither do I blame Mr.
Chong. He is here for what he
can get out of it, and 1 glory in his
gall and the energy with which he
lives up to his principle.
Hut I do blame the authorities
for charging a rental which it is
impossible to pay, and in the face of
that allow such competition to ex
ist. By so doing, they show their
sad lack of insight and their de
plorably poor business ability, not
to mention their utter lack of sym
pathy for the students of Stanford
University. For if they would
give a man half a chance, the Inn
would be a feature of the campus
to which one could point \yith
pride, Encina Hall would be full,
and the less wealthy student would
not be compelled to live on coffee
and sinkers.
Let me inform you, that the Inn
is now putting up all any man can
give for fifteen cents and come
out nearly even at the end of the
month. This I assert in view of
the f;ict that a large number of
employees on the buildings have
lately come to the Inn for their
meals, showing that the place is
competing even with the China
man.
A decent chef cannot be obtained
for a cent less than seventy-five
dollars, and he invariably requires
an assistant for not less than forty
dollars, not to speak of dishwater,
vegetable man, pot washer, etc.
With these expenses, the price of
meat gone up two and a half cents
in the last four months or so, it is
impossible to make the Inn a suc
cess under the circumstances. Vet
no one is more anxious to make
the Inn pay both ways, for him
who keeps it as well as for him
who patronizes it, than the present
ma nagement.
