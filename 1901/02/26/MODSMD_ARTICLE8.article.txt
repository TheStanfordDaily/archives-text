# SUNDAY SERMON.
## Professor A. O. Lovejoy Delivers an Address on "Being an Individual." 
### 
The service in the chapel Sun
day morning was an impressive
one, made so by the musical and
the poetical selections which came
into such close harmony with Pro
fessor Lovejoy's rather short but
thoroughly philosophic sermon.
Professor Lovejoy selected his text
from the seventh chapter of
Romans, dwelling distinctively on
the twenty-fourth verse: "0
wretched man that I am! who shall
deliver me from the body of this
death?" Among other things he
said:
"We are used to think that man's
power of thought is his chief dig
nity. Pascal says: 'Man knows
his littleness and therein lies his
greatness.' Man is distinguished
by self-consciousness thatsets man's
forces at war with each other and
which introduces the shadow of
doubt, the grief and sorrow of
reminiscences. This self-conscious
ness prevents him from being the
direct and single being which we
conceive the animals to be.
"The reason childhood is beauti
ful is that the child is but partly
emerged from his happy sponta
neity. He has not yet the con
sciousness of inner warfare, of the
conflict between goo<l and evil. It
is not because he comes from
heaven enueloped in a cloudy mist
of glory, but because he is nearer
the animal, that be is beautiful and
charming.
"The adult man is a hybrid of
animal and the divine; he is con
demned to be vexed by ideals he
can never reach, and to be grieved
by the evils of recollection.
"But a reasonable way of look
ing at the whole matter of life is
not one of complaint. We cannot
help the situation; we cannot go
back to childhood if we would.
"It would lie a sad thing if the
transition from childhood to man
hood were always a change for the
worse. The joys of adult life are
deeper than those of the child. It
is true that man stands out from
nature, that he is doomed to be
dissatisfied because he is not what
he wishes to be. But this dissatis
faction is not a thing to try to get
away from. The life of natural
impulses is not enough; the life
which is not united with the self
consciousness of the inner struggle
is not what it should be.
"Religion, no matter of what
form, is the highest part of man,
because it enables him to grapple
with this discord, to see that this
discord is not final. The most
complete devotion does not do away
with struggle, but it allows a man
to recognize the conflict, and hav
ing once found himself, allows him
to then work out his own salva
tion."
