# Papas Had to Shell Out $15,000.

A conservative estimate places
some figures on the Junior Hop
that furnish food for reflection.
It is not an exaggeration to say
that it cost on an average of $25 to
each young man to bring his lady
here, to furnish her with flowers,
cah fare, sleigh rides, Glee Club
concert, and general entertainment.
There were 215 young men pres
ent.
215 men at $25 each $4,375
There were an equal number of
young ladies, and it is a low figure
to say that the gowns worn by
them at last night's function would
average up to $50. Most of the
gowns worn were made especially
for jthe occasion and will not be
worn again. So that dressmakers
and drygoods men had a benefit to
the extent of over $10,000.
In other words a modest esti
mate would make it appear that
the "J" Hop of last night cost the
dear papas about $15,000. â€”Uni-
