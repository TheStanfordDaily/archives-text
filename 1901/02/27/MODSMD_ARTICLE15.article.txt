Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As the tide of communications to
the Palo Alto seems to be run
ning strong Hood just now, I should
very much like to say a few words
in behalf of the Orchestra before
the current slackens too much. The
Orchestra, as recently organized,
consists of a nucleus of good solid
players, who have enthusiasm for
the work in hand. The aim of the
organization is to play only high
class music, and that primarily for
the pleasure of playing, and with
no hope for sweaters or hours of
credit for the work and time given.
Considering the rapid progress that
is being made at present, it is not,
however, at all improbable that
before the close of the semester the
Orchestra will be in a position to
give a very creditable concert.
What is needed, however, is more
players. We have about eight vio
lins, where we should have four
teen or more. Cellos are also badly
needed, while the greatest need of
all is more brass instruments.
Either I have been inclined to

over-estimate the amount of real
musical ability in the University,
or a great many players are wait
ing for personal invitations to join
the organization. It should he
borne in mind that one does not by
any means need to be a soloist to
do effective work in the Orchestra.
In fact soloists are very often the
very worst material to work with,
since they are very difficult to con
trol. Like star football players,
they do not readily learn team
work.
I should like to make an appeal
to all who are interested in the
development of a successful orches
tra at the University, to attend the
rehearsal in the chapel on Thurs
day evening at 7:30, those having
instruments bringing them along.
If anyone having a fair under
standing of music and desiring to
work up some wind instrument
(horn, oboe, bassoon, etc.) will
make his wishes known, I will
gladly see what can be done to
ward making their fulfillment pos
sible. I would also add that from
one to four alto band horns could
be utilized, as it seems impossible
to get French-horn players. I
trust there will be a sufficient num
ber interested to make a success of
the Orchestra. There is noobjection
whatever to persons not connected
with the University becoming
members. In fact such people will
be heartily welcome.
