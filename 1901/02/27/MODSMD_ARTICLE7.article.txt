# JACK LONDON'S READING.
## Delights a Large Audience With His Powerful Tale, "The Odyssey of the North." 
### 
To have heard Jack London in
the chapel last night is to have
heard that author's initial reading
before a public audience, and to
have received a pleasure accorded
but seldom to most of us.
Mr. London read his "Odyssey
of the North," a weird story of
northern life, rich in pathos and
abounding in descriptions of na
ture, and human life, physical and
social. The language of the story
is in the main poetical and savors
in part of the mining camp and
the sailor's life; many of his fig
ures are drawn from sea-life in a
strangely new form which sur
prises and at once pleases. Some
of his sentences remind one of pas
sages in Scripture; some revel in
assonance, others in alliteration.
Thrown into the story are nu
merous references, some of them
historical, many relating to the
customs of the natives and miners
of the Yukon region. There are
criticisms on the world's untruth
fulness, and the fickleness of pub
lic opinion; yet these are brought
in so incidentally that the main
interest in the story never suffers.
Mr. London's range of imagination
comes out prominently in his de
scriptions of scenes and attitudes
of mind; the mythological episode
telling how "He of the Otter-skins"
came to lie is a most beautiful pro
duct of a vivid, sympathetic, and
thrilling imagination.
Mr. London had nothing of the
professional about him. He read
in a perfectly natural manner,
which though at first a surprise,
proved to carry well. His man
ner, though subdued and lacking
the fervor of an elocutionist, gained
favor as he proceeded in the read
ing.
