# VARSITY WINS.
## Santa Clara Loses a Stubbornly Contested Game. Score 7 to 2. 
### 
The game between the Varsity
and the Santa Clara College team
this afternoon was for the first
seven innings an extremely close
and exciting exhibition of baseball.
The only feature in which the game
was sorely lacking was in hitting.
Neither Santa Clara nor Stanford
seemed able to hit safe, and most of
our runs were scored on errors.
Stanford brought in her first
tally in the first inning. In the
second a pretty home run over the
right field fence by Strube gave
Santa Clara two runs, and placed
her in the lead, which she main
tained up to the seventh inning, no
more runs being made by either
side. The Varsity often had men
on third base, but weak batting
caused them to die there.
Santa Clara lost the game in the
seventh inning. Tritch, who had
replaced Parker in the box, went
to first on a fumble by Keefe,
and went down to second on
Edwards' pretty bunt. Misner's
safety advanced both men one peg.
Cowden hit to short-stop and the
catcher failed to touch Tritch at
the plate. The next play resulted
in a similar error, and Misrier and
Ed wards scored. Cowden came
home «n Brown's long drive to cen
ter. The Varsity again scored twice
in the eighth, but Santa Clara could
not tally after the second inning.
The Santa Clara players put up
a stubborn game to the very last,
but the delivery of Tritch and
Parker seemed to be too much for
them. Keefe pitched good bail,
but the support from the other end
of the battery was poor.
For Stanford, Edwards, Mistier,
and Cowden played the best game.
