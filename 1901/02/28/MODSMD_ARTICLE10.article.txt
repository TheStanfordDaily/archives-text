# Senior Assessments.
## 
### 
The Senior Week and Finance
committees met this afternoon and
decided to levy an assessment of
$2.50 upon the members of the
Senior Class. This is only half the
amount usually levied on the grad
uating class, but it was thought
that this would he sufficient, with
the surplus the class now lias on
hand, to give the finest Senior Week
ever held at Stanford. The various
committees were instructed to make
out and present to the Finance
Committee within two weeks a de
tailed statement of what their re
ceipts and expenditures will be
likely to be.
