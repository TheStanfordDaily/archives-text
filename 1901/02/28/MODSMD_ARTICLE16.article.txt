# Dr. Branner Speaks.

### 
At a dinner given last night in
Chicago by the University Club of
Chicago in honor of the Association
of American Universities, Dr. Bran
ner spoke upon the freedom of
speech in the university circles.
He is quoted in the Examiner of
this morning as saying:
"In the olden times when the
devil got in good society it was the
custom to sprinkle him with holy
water or confront him with the
cross. In a similar manner must
we deal with various questions these
days. The freedom of academic
speech means free speech at all
times and under all circumstances.
Furthermore, free speech can be
used for all purposes; to accomp
lish good and to bring evil results.
I Therefore, the question must be re
garded by both sides. It largely
depends how it is used and what
we make of it, before it can be
countenanced.
"It is a serious charge to say
that students in educational insti
tutions are harrowed as much by
their instructors as are the mobs
in the street. If that is true there
are men harrowing the young and
filling their minds with nonsense.
Should a college professor be al
lowed to teach free love, politics,
and what he believes? Are uni
versities conducted for the purpose
of education or the propaganda of
frankness? Some men give up
life positions for the sake of their
ideals and ideas. This should be
the course pursued by college pro
fessors who find their duties uncon
genial.
"If such unlimited freedom of
speech is permitted, what is to be
come of the college president? Is
he to sit idly by and be held ac
countable for every unbridled
tongue found in the faculty of his
university?
"Partisanship in colleges should
lie avoided by all means. How
ever, universities and colleges
should have a wider influence in
politics. Economic questions should
be impressed upon the students
from the time they enter the col
lege until they leave. But neither
the Republican party nor the Dem
ocratic party nor any other party
should be favored. There should
be no playing to the galleries. It
should be borne in mind that when
learned men enter politics they
usually make fools of themselves.
"The Leland Stanford Jr. Univer
sity believes in allowing its profes
sors freedom in the matter of instruc
tion and action. At the same time,
they must exercise such restraint
that they shall not infringe upon
the rights of others. This is but
fair to the students intrusted to us.
We shall not make our University
a tail - piece for any political party.
"Pulpit orators, canting critics,
ignorant sycophants, and self-con
stituted committees have referred
to us as something to be shunned
for our action regarding the gentle
man dismissed from the Leland
Stanford Jr. University. They have
turned loose the very vials of their
wrath. This has shown them up
in their true colors.
"Regarding this episode, 1 desire
to say that Mrs. Stanford did not
request the dismissal of the gentle
man. She simply said that he
was not a fit person to be a mem
ber of the faculty..
"The faculty concurred in her
opinion, and thus he severed his
connection with the Leland Stan
ford Jr. University."
