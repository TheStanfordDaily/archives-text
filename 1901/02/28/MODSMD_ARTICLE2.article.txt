Eighteen men have signified
their intention of entering the
tennis tournament of singles which

will be held on the Encina courts

A new scheme lias been hit upon
which will allow each man to com
pete twice, and so give every player
an opportunity to show his best
ability. Four groups of two each
have been arranged with reference
to the skill of the various players.
The losers of these groups will play
four men of about equal ability,
and the winners of the original
groups will meet the four best men
of this second series. This will
leave eight men to compete in the
finals, four men advanced in the
series, and four men picked from
the whole number as possibly su
perior. The position of the contes
tants will be posted at the courts,
and will lie published tomorrow.

ment play will begin at 9 a.m.

the (irst series of games should be
