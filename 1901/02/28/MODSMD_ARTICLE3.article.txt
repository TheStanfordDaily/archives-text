Captain Stewart had the squad
on the track last night breaking
in the new men. No hard work
was done, all the men starting off
the mark a few times, and running
enough to loosen up the muscles.
It is not the intention to work the
candidates hard for a few days;
but as yesterday, particular atten
tion will be given to the stride, so
that when the hard work begins no
time will be lost in correcting
minor faults. Some of the Fresh
men showed up well, getting off the
mark fast and finding their stride
quickly. Others will have to prac
tice considerably before they can
run easily. All the men on the
field showed an eagerness to learn,
and were quick to act upon any
suggestion of the trainer.
The track, though not complete,
is in good shape for this season of
the year. The covering of clay is
just yielding enough to give under
the runner, saving him from sore
muscles, and yet not too soft to
prevent good work. A little later
in the season a coating of cinders
will be added to the clay bed, thus
making it suitable for hard train
ing.
