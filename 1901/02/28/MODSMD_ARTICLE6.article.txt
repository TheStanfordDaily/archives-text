# FAVORS THE PROPOSITION.
## Debating Committee Desires to Accept Challenge for a Contest at Nebraska. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Intel-society Debating League this
afternoon expressed itself as favor
ing the enlargement of our field
for debating contests by accepting
the challenge from the University
of Nebraska. The final decision
rests with the student body, and
the matter will be presented at a
special meeting of the Executive
Committee called 'for tomorrow
evening, before an answer is sent to
Nebraska. The proposal is to send
a team there, with all expenses
[>aid by Nebraska, to meet one from
that institution.
President English called the
meeting to order at 1:30, stating
that it was called to consider the
advisability of accepting either the
challenge for debate from the Uni
versity of Washington, or the one
from Nebraska, or both. A mo
tion was made by Decarli that the
committee favor accepting the last
proposition received from Nebraska.
After considerable discussion, this
was|carried with one dissenting vote.
During the discussion Marrack
said that the challenge from Wash
ington had supplanted the need
for a debate with Nebraska, since
the idea of another contest is mere
ly to enlarge the field, and we owe
it to neighboring Coast institutions
to meet them first. Others thought
that more interest would be aroused
by meeting an Eastern university.
Decarli argued that funds needed
in the future could be raised by
admission charges to the debates.
Merritt thought that as soon as
the contests became established,
prize funds would be donated, as is
the case at Chicago University,
sufficient to meet all the expenses.
Adams said that it was a question
as to whether the present system,
which brings only three men to
the front each year, should be con
tinued, or whether the field should
be expanded. Scott advocated, in
case the debate is determined upon,
the selection of two teams, one to
meet Berkeley and the other Ne
braska, between which no distinc
tion should be made.
A motion made by McCormick
stating that if the Nebraska debate
is not arranged, the committee ex
press itself as favorable to meeting
Washington, but that if it is, the
challenge from the latter institu
tion be declined for this semester,
was carried. The committee also
decided, in either event, to support
the selection of two intercollegiate
teams.
