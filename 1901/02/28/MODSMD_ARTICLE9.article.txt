# THE 						HENSCHEL CONCERT.
## Appearance of Famous Singers Artistically and Financially a Gratifying- Success. 
### 
The Henschel recital in the As
sembly Hall last night was thor
oughly excellent, and the large at
tendance speaks well for Stanford's
appreciation of that, the best music.
Mr. and Mrs. Henschel came be
fore the audience with their duet
from " I Traci Amanti," in which
they at once won the entire confi
dence of the hearer. There was
mingled the passion of the stern
voice with the gaiety of the lighter,
while subsequent numbers of a hap
pily selected program assured the
audience of the excellence of each
voice.
Mrs. Henschel has a wonderful
clearness of tone and enunciation,
a wide range and charming sweet
ness of voice, which characterized
each selection and found its height
of expression in the lighter music
of the old English and Irish Folk
song.
Mr. Henschel's voice showed re
markable clearness in his initial
solo, "In Questa Tomba " in which
the softness of the Italian language
showed how much more exquisitely
it lends itself to musical purposes
than the harsher tones of the north
ern tongues.
"Saul's Dream" permitted the
betrayal of wonderful resonance
and passion; "Venath" showed deep
pathos and sympathy ;"DasWasser"
sparkled with merriment, while the
accompaniment was masterly in
technique.
Mr. and Mrs. Henschel are in
strong sympathy with each other;
Mr. Henschel's accompaniment was
most perfect in the Irish Folksong,
and the closing duet from "Don
I'asquale," voices and instrument
were in perfect harmony.
The concert was successful finan
cially as well as musically. Over
six hundred tickets were sold, and
notwithstanding the large expense
involved, the management cleared
between fifty and sixty dollars.
