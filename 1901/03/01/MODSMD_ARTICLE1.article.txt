# WILL DEBATE NEBRASKA..
## Executive Committee Decides That Stanford Accept Challenge and Send Team to Lincoln. 
### 
By the unanimous vote of the
Executive Comrtiittee this after
noon, Stanford debating was form
ally launched on its era of expan
sion. After a pro and con discus
sion of the challenge received from
the University of Nebraska, this
resolution was adopted:
"Resolved, That the Intercollegi
ate Debating Committee be author
ized to accept thechallenge for a de
bate to be held at Lincoln, Ne
braska, this semester, provided
that the return debate for next
year be held in the fall semester,
and provided that further arrange
ments for this debate shall in no
wise operate to the detriment of
the Intercollegiate debate with
California."
In accordance with this authori
zation, Frank Adams for the De
bating Committee immediately
wired as follows:
il B. R. Gordon, University of
Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska; â€”
Stanford will debate Lincoln this
semester and pay expenses of
bringing Nebraska team here next
year if debate held here fall se
mester. If this and suggested ar
rangements for question satisfac
tory, proceed immediately and wire
result. Suggest tentatively April
16th for this year." .
When first broached in the Ex
ecutive Committee meeting, the
proposition excited considerable
discussion. To the acceptance of
Nebraska's invitation there was no
opposition, the only question being
as to the time for which the con
test shall beset. The opinion was
prevalent that the new debate
must not be allowed to interfere in
any way with the regular debate
with California, and that in order
to avoid such a contingency we
must meet Nebraska in the fall
rather than in the spring after this
year. The manner of selecting the
team has been determined. At the
Intercollegiate finals to be held
Saturday, March 9th, two debating
teams will be chosen. One will
meet California on the affirmative
side of the question previously
chosen, the other will debate at
Nebraska, question and sides yet to
be arranged.
This new arrangement will ne
cessitate the breaking off of ne
gotiations with Washington for this
year at least. According to present
appearances, however, Stanford will
in the future be a contestant in
four intercollegiate debates.
