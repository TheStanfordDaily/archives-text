Chapel services are held at
eleven o'clock on Sunday mornings,
and not at 11:15 or 11:20, as a
large number of people seem to
think. For the past four or five
Sundays more than half the con
gregation has been anywhere from
five to twenty minutes late in com
ing to chapel. As a result the ser
vice has of necessity been delayed
several minutes until the people
got seated. At the chapel, if any
where, people ought to be prompt in
attendance. Tardiness causes de
lay and confusion in seating, and
gives visiting clergymen unfavor
able opinions of us.
