The Chaparral comes out this
week with the statement that it
"wouldn't dare" to say anything
against the Christian Associations,
and then devotes what might other
wise have been valuable space to
reviling these organizations in the
most bitter terms. "0 consistency,
thou art a jewel!" The Daily
Palo Alto agrees with the Chapar
ral that these associations should
be kept out of politics, but this is
no excuse for anyone making such
defamatory statements as our con
temporary is guilty of publishing.
Our Christian Associations have a
great work ahead of them here and
we wish them success in everything
but politics. They should receive
the support of everyone, and not
the vilification of even this clique,
composed of "knockers," scoffers,
and defeated politicians. This is
an editogal about nothing.
