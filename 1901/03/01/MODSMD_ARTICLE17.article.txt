# Baseball Rules Changed.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the National
League baseball magnates Wednes
day several changes of importance
were made in the code of baseball
rules. The object of the changes
is to make the game faster, and to
avoid the delay which skillful pro
fessionals often cause.
The substance of the changes is
as follows: The catcher shall
stand within ten feet of the plate
throughout the game. An inten
tional foul shall be counted a strike
unless the batter already has two
strikes. When the batter is hit by
a pitched ball he shall not take his
base, but he will be accredited with
a ball. The pitcher is not allowed
to hold the ball over twenty sec
onds, and if he throws to the bags,
one ball shall be counted against
him for each throw.
