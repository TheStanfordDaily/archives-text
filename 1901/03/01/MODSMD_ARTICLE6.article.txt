# Addresses Stanford Girls.

### 
Mrs. Kembricks, principal of
Vassar College, addressed a large
number of Stanford girls at Roble
yesterday afternoon. She spoke in
an informal manner of Vassar,
dwelling chiefly upon its features
distinctive from other educational
institutions.
"Unlike Stanford, Vassar has
traditions and with them has the
advantages and disadvantages of
conservatism. For some years we
have been troubled with the ques
tion whether we want to grow or
not. We have had a theory of
housing all our students under our
own roof, and though we have
from time to time built new dormi
tories, we are still confronted with
the same troubleâ€”more appli
cants than we can receive.
"There are a thousand people on
the campus, class feeling is strong,
but this does not preclude the for
mation of delightful friendships
outside of class circles. The Senior
Class is an important factor in col
lege government and society; it is
always under the scrutiny of the
faculty, however, and has never
been out of harmony with them.
"There are many social events,
chiefly at the end of the week; but
because we are so many, no one
thinks of going to all the social
functions. The coming of a Senior's
mother is made the occasion for
signal entertainment. The Senior
parlor is furnished by each succeed
ing class, the wood being limited
to mahogany, and each class hav
ing its own scheme.
"Vassar is distinctly athletic;
art and music come our way, and
many of our classes go to New
York to theatres and museums."
Her talk was followed by a re
ception, Mesdames Jordan, Still
man, Elliott, Branner, Howard,
Miss Denton, and Miss Ray, among
others, participating.
