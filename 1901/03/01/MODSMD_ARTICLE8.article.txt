### 
The Varsity will take a trip to
San Jose tomorrow in order to
meet the San Jose Normal team.
Not much is known of the Normal
players except that they played a
close game with Santa Clara.
The Stanford team should win,
but as the Normal players have
been working hard there may be
a surprise. There has been no
change on the Varsity, although
the playing of some of the men
on Thursday would justify it.
The Stanford team will be com
posed of the following men: Park
er, Tritch, pitchers; Ball, catcher;
Cowden, first base; Misner, second
base; Edwards, short-stop; Conner,
third base; Lowenthal, left field;
Symonds, right field; Brown,center
field.
