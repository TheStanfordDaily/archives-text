# JUNIOR FARCE WON.
## L.M. Bowman and Bristow Adams Awarded First Place in the Competition. 
### 
"Driven Back to Egypt, or the
Riddle of the Sphinxes" is the title
of the farce that will be presented
by the Class of '02 on the eve of
Junior Day. The farce is the
joint production of Larrey Bowman
and Bristow Adams, the most
prominent members of the Chapar
ral board, and differs somewhat
from recent college farces, in that
it depends for its success altogether
on a finely developed plot, clever
ness of dialogue, careful character
drawing, and humor of situations,
rather than on local "gags,"
"stunts," and songs. In this re
spect it is like ''James Wobberts,"
being a play from start to finish,
and one that would be enjoyed in
any theater as well as on the Stan
ford campus. It does not, how
ever, lack in local color and al
lusions.
The competition was this year
closer than there has been for any
farce at Stanford, there being five
contestants, all with excellent pro
ductions. The committee nar
rowed the contest down to three,
but were unable to come to a defi
nite decision. They referred the
plays to Miss Pearson of the Eng
lish department, and with her, de
cided on "Driven Back to Egypt"
as by far the best play, although
the others were so excellent in their
particular lines that the question
was largely as to what kind of the
atricals tiie Juniors wished to
stage. One presented bv Marrack,
'01, was lacking in plot, but was
the best in local hits and humor
based on recent events. The other
was an operetta by Miss Kidder and
Miss Daly, which depended for its
catchiness on its clever songs. It
is possible that the Junior Class
may later present the two plays
which were such close seconds, for
the benefit of the Annual. They
are both short and could be put on
in one night.
Bowman and Adams will pro
ceed with the staging of the farce
at once.
In "Driven Back to Egypt," the
collaboration has been so close that
it would be almost impossible to
separate the work of the two au
thors, still it can be said that the
main plot is all the work of
Bowman; the working out of the
main sub-plot, and much of the
character drawing, is by Adams.
Bowman has collaborated with \\ .
H. Irwin on the extravaganza
"Atalanta in Stanford." He wrote
some of the songs for the Senior
farce last year, among them being
the well-known "One, Two, Three,
Four."
Adams is tin* founder and editor
of the Chaparral. lie wrote the
clever "Berkeley Tales" snnir in
last year's Senior farce, and
helped in the staging of both Jun
ior and Senior farces last vear
