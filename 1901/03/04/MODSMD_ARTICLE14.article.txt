# A 						Letter from Manila.

An interesting letter from John
E. Springer, '00, Varsity debater
for two years, who left for Manila
in December, to J. H. McDougall
of Salinas, has been published in
the Salinas Index. Springer wrote
in part: "1 finally got away from
San Francisco on the transport
Meade, which left on the first of
December. 1 have got along
swimmingly. I had my choice of
a number of different jobs at once
â€”teaching, postoffice work, or
working in the government de
partments at stenography. All of
these jobs paid from $100 to $125
gold per month. I found that the
lawyers who are here are doing ex
ceptionally well, and that the field
is not over crowded. The leading
lawyer is clearing up something
like $30,000 gold per year, and none
of them are making less than
$3000. American courts have not
been introduced here yet, and
things are very unsettled, but the
lawyers claim that they will make
still more money as soon as Ameri
can courts are introduced. So I
have decided to keep clear of
government service, and work for a
private firm until 1 can save up a
little money and master Spanish,
and then branch into the law busi
ness. Accordingly 1 have gone to
work for $100, gold, for Castle
Brothers, Wolf & Son, the leading
importing and exporting firm in
the islands. 1 am stenographer
and assistant book-keeper. In the
meanwhile 1 am picking up valu
able knowledge of business con
ditions and methods in the islands.
For a civilian I have never seen a
nicer place to live, and just at
present I think there are few bet
ter places for young Americans. 1
am glad that 1 came."
