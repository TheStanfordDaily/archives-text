# HANDBALL PRELIMINARIES.
## First Series of Games Played Saturday. Contests Were Close and Exciting. 
### 
The preliminary contests in the
handball tournament of singles
which were held last Saturday in
the Encina gymnasium were very
close and exciting.
llaitt and Gundrum probably
put up the best game of the series.
Both are very good players and
some beautiful and difficult returns
were made by them. The contest
between Pollard and Knight was a
very hard one. The match of
Harkins and Sill was probably the
closest one of the whole series, and
a summary of points would give
Sill the games. Harkins, however,
won two games out of three. The
winners of the singles and the
scores of the various players are as
fol lows:
