# VARSITY WINS.
## San Jose Normal Defeated on Her Home Grounds by Stanford. Score, 20-8. 
### 
The Varsity took the first game
of the Normal School series on the
San Jose grounds last Saturday.
The game was disappointing
throughout, as the Stanford pitch
ers were found too easily by the
Normal men. Tritch began the
game for Stanford and allowed the
Normal men to make four runs in
the first two innings. He then
gave way to Palmer. Both pitch
ers seemed to have left their speed
at home.
The Normals were the first to
score, making two runs in the first
inning. In the second, Conner,
Brown, Symonds, and Tritch
crossed the plate. In the third,
Brown and Misner tallied. In the
fourth, Murphy made a long hit to
center, which resulted in a home
run; and in the fifth, Stanford
scored twice and Normal once.
The sixth was the first inning in
which neither team scored. In the
seventh, Stanford made three to
one. In the eighth there was no
score, and in the ninth Stanford
ran up seven to Normal's nothing.
The final score read 20-8.
The feature of the game was the
stick work and base running of
Murphy. Cowden, Symonds, and
Brown all played good ball for
Stanford, while Meese was the star
of the Normal team.
Martin, the Normal pitcher,
fanned eight Stanford men.
