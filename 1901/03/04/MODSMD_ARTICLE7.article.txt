## Class Contests Were the Order at the Enema Courts Last Saturday. Adams Wins by Default. 
### 
A close and interesting prelimi
nary tennis tournament was held on
the University courts last Satur
day. The play began at 9 a.m.
and ended about 4 p.m. with only
about an hour's stop for lunch.
All four courts were used, as they
were in good condition. The show
ing made by the contestants was
good for so early in the season.
Sixteen players took part in the
tournament, and the results were
as follows: Court I—Luce,'ol,1 —Luce,'01, de
feated Talbot, '02, by default, but
was in turn beaten by Baker, '03,
who lost to Roth, '03, after three
fast, close sets. Court 2 —Roseberry,
'02, won from Gregory, '99, and R.
C. Leib, '03, and was beaten by
Weihe, '03. Court 3 —Watson, '04,
defeated Fuller, '04, and was beaten
by Gage, '02, who lost to Adams,
'04, after two hard sets. Boyle, '04,
beat Thompson, '01, Holbrook,
'03, and F. A. Leib, '00, but was
defeated in the semi-finals by
Adams, '04. The other two men
who made the semi-finals were
Weihe, '03, and Roth, '03, but, as
they did not play their set, Adams
won by default.
The men who put up the best
games in the day's tournament
were Adams, Roth, Weihe, and
Boyle, the winners who played
on the semi-finals. The playing
of Boyle was a great surprise to
everyone, as he is a new man, who
made his first appearance in a Uni
versity tennis tournament last
Saturday. Gage and Baker also
played fast, strong games, and
were beaten by Adams and Roth
only after closely contested sets.
This tournament is not in any
sense a try-out, but is only a pre
liminary contest to furnish an op
portunity of sizing up the different
men. A tournament will be held,
as announced in another column,
next Saturday, March 9th, to de
termine the first place in the singles.
All entries must be in by 12 o'clock
Thursday. Drawings for places
will be held at 9:20 a.m., and the
