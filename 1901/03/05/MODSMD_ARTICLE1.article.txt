## Both Fields Used in Last Night's Practice.â€”Varsity to Play Santa Clara Wednesday. 
### 
The baseball men were divided
into two squads at yesterday after
noon's practice, the Varsity under
Dr. Murphy working on the oval,
while the second nine men under
Swindells, '01, played on the old
diamond. The practice of the
Varsity consisted in batting and
fielding, there being no line-up.
Two nines were picked from the
second team men and they played
several innings of fairly good ball.
Jn the last few days the baseball
team has been materially strength
ened by Chester Murphy's return
to the diamond. Chet is an ex
ceedingly fast fielder and base-run
ner and bis batting is first class.
With Murphy, Brown, and Sy
monds, we will have one of the
fastest outfields Stanford has ever
bad.
Tomorrow the Varsity will again
cross bats with Santa Clara, and a
lively and interesting game will
undoubtedly result. Although Stan
ford has defeated Santa Clara
twice this season, the games have
been closely contested and we can
always depend on our rivals from
Santa Clara to put up a stubborn
fight, although it be a losing one.
The teams will line up as follows:
STANFORD. SANTA CLAUA.
