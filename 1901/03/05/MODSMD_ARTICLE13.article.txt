Nothing lias yet been divulged
by them that govern as to the man
ner in which this paper's sugges
tion regarding the allowance of
University credit to intercollegiate
debaters was received. Aside from
being a response to an urgent
call for "copy," the aforesaid ar
ticle was written for a purpose.
In it the attention of the Univer
sity was called to these facts: that
the men who are doing more than
any other single individuals, in
or out of the student body, toward
making the name of Stanford
synonymous with brains, are re
ceiving but paltry recognition of
their work; and second, that there
is a golden opportunity for the
authorities to add one more item
to our debt of gratitude by initiat
ing this measure. The matter
takes on added interest in view of
the recent expansion of our debat
ing field, and the attendant per
plexing problem of how to produce
half a score of first-rank debaters
instead of three. The plan advo
cated would, we believe, do much
toward solving this question.
There are men in college today
who, if latent talent had been de
veloped, would long since have
won debater's pins. The conferring
of credit granted for equivalent
college work would serve two ends:
It would induce more contestants
to enter preliminaries, render com
petition keener, and so produce
more debaters of Varsity calibre;
and further, it would fittingly re
ward the men who burn midnight
oil that victory may be Stanford's.
Like other sagacious reformers, we
do not expect the light to shine in
dark places all in a moment, but if
keeping everlastingly at it is as
eflicacious a method as history
would persuade us to believe, there
is ever-increasing hope that our de
baters will eventually be accorded
justice.
