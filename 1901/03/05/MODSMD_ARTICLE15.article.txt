Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The contrast between the outdoor
air and that of the foul smelling
gymnasium dressing-rooms is best
appreciated when coming in from
a cross-country run. We need far
more space and more intelligent
ventilation in these rooms. They
can be ventilated so as to avoid
drafts and yet get rid of the sweaty
stench now so disagreeably appar
ent.
There would be far more bathing
done if the shower-room were better
equipped. Men are frequently
seen standing around getting
chilled while waiting their turn to
take a shower.
That the floor space in the main
exercising room is insufficient is
too generally conceded to need
further comment.
To get at the blunt truth, our
need of an enlarged or a new gym
nasium is a decided one. There is
no doubt iis to the moral influence
of a bright, up-to-date, attractive
building. We need it very badly
indeed. Could we not have a por
tion of our recent increase in reve
nue devoted to this end? We stu
dents fully appreciate theenormous
expense involved in present build
ing enterprises, but we feel our
need in this direction is open to
serious and favorable consideration.
