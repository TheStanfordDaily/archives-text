### 
A letter from A. R Show, pro
fessor of European History here
last year, and now taking semi
nary work in history at Leipsic,
Germany, has been received by Dr.
G E. Howard and was by him given
to the Department Seminary.
Professor Show speaks of German
methods of work entertainingly
and at length. He says that bis
work is "very profitable and in
tensely interesting," but that he
longs for Stanford again.
