## Rev. Eugene Benson Preached an Interesting Sermon Sunday Morning. 
### 
The Rev. Eugene Benson of Santa
Clara officiated at Episcopal services
in the chapel Sunday morning, lie
chose the text for his sermon from
II Cor. 7-10, "For Godly sorrow
worketh repentance to salvation
not to he repented of: but the sor
row of the world worketh death."
He said:
''There are two paths which lead
to the higher things of life; they
correspond to two great classes of
men. There are thousands of
homes that send out men and
women brought up to venerate old
age, respect womanhood, and re
gard infirmity with tenderness. In
contrast to these are the homes
where temperance in eating and
drinking are unknown, where there
is a double standard of morality
for the two sexes, where childhood
and weakness are not considered,
nor old age revered.
"When man turns his attention
to the higher things of life, he shows
bis early training. The man, used
to violent experiences, will find the
contrast between his old life and
the one to which he has turned so
powerful that he loses his balance.
The man whose life has been quiet
will experience no such violent re
vulsion. To him conscience is not
a fierce accuser, but merely a voice
of reproach. He simply directs
his footsteps along the paths 011
which they were originally started.
"This class of mild repenters is
comparatively small; most of us at
times do repent revulsively.
"The thought of lamentation calls
for comfort. 'Those that mourn
shall be comforted.' This is true
of all without exception. St. Paul
is 110 sentimentalist when be says
so, but he distinguishes between
sorrow which is only of the world
and sorrow which is Godly.
"Nature has set a check to our
excesses. In the reaction that fol
lows indulgence, the drunkard and
voluptuary repent, but their sor
rows are effervescent, and soon they
return to their tumultuous career.
"This is not a Godly sorrow, but
only one of the world. It means
death, for it causes the loss of self
respect. Other sorrows of the
world are the revelation to the
world of some trait of character we
have desired to conceal from pub
lic gaze, the sorrow of having failed
to obtain something on which we
have set our hearts, sorrow for
things of the world.
"Godly sorrow may be a rising
up of self-respect, a realization of
justice, a sense of responsibility,
truth, or wisdom; whatever it be, it
makes no difference so long as we
suffer it to work in us a Godly
sorrow."
