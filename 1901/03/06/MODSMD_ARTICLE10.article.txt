A fact to be commented favor
ably upon is that tbe men working
on the track under the guidance of
Dr. Murphy have good judgment
of pace. The trainer always times
the men while they are running,
and insists upon them knowing
their speed. Some new men are
trying for the quarter, and under
this system it is possible to learn
something of their vnlue as Var
sity material. Slaker, '02, is con
sidered the best candidate for this
distance of any of the new men
who have appeared. He not only
has speed and form but also
strength to hold to a hard pace.
Knight, '03, and Kennedy, '04, are
two likely candidates in this event;
and with Smith, '03, and Hawley,
'03, of last year's team and Birtch
of the '99 team, we bid fair to win
the quarter this year.
The only new man thus far to
try tbe walk is Lewis, '04. He is
inexperienced, hut should have a
long stride soon, which, coupled
with the endurance be is known to
possess, should make him a possible
point winner.
