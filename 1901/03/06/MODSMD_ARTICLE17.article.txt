We have been following the
course laid down at the beginning
of this semester in regard to hav
ing only workers on the staff of the
Daily Palo Alto. Changes in its
make-up have been made from
time to time. When we have had
new namen to add, it has given us
great pleasure to do so, and when
we have found it necessary to re
move members who think that
they ought to be retained on ac
count of work done during some
anterior time in the history of the
paper, we have done so with the
greatest reluctance. Invariably
such members have left with bit
ter words, accusing us of partiality
and personal animosity. We
would like to say here that the edi
tor has no ill feeling toward any
one, and has no cause to have any.
His whole purpose is to make the
Daily as great a success as pos
sible. Anyone who has been
dropped from the staff can very
easily regain his place by showing
an interest in the paper and a de
sire to help it along. But the edi
tor insists on his right to separate
the drones from the workers.
