# Change in the "Quad."
## 
### 
A change has been made in the
fraternity representation in this
year's Quad. It was at tirst the
intention to devote two pages of
matter to each fraternity, one page
to bear the national chapter roll

and the other the membership roll
at Stanford with a picture of the
chapter house. By a decision of
the editors the picture of the house
will be omitted, and an entire page
will be devoted to a picture of each
fraternity, thus following the plan
of the 1900 Annual.
The Junior Farce Committee has
decided to present Marrack's farce
for the benefit of the Quad. It will
probably he played about the mid
dle of April.
