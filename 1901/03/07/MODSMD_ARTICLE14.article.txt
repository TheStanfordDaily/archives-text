The members of the Alumni As
sociation of the Santa Liosa high
school are trying to establish a
scholarship. Their idea is to raise
a fund large enough so that the
interest from it will pay all ex
penses of some graduate from that
high school for a university course.
The principal will make the ap
pointment, and the successful stu
dent may choose either of the Cali
fornia universities. All present
indications seem to bode success for
the scheme. It would be an ex
cellent idea if all the high school
alumni associations of the State
would take up this plan, and, if
they do, university students and
graduates will have to take the
initiative in the movement. They
know better than others how valu
able a college education is and
how hard it is for students without
money to get along. Everyone of
them should enlist the sympathy
of his or her alumni association,
and with its co-operation make a
great success of the project.
