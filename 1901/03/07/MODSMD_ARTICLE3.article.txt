# Intercollegiate Finals.
## 
### 
Two teams will be chosen at the
final Intercollegiate debating try
out next Saturday evening. The
Executive Committee of the Inter
society Debating League at its last
meeting voted to make no distinc
tion between them, but inasmuch
as the student body Executive Com
mittee gave its consent for the Ne
braska debate only upon condi
tion that it should in no way im
pair our chances against Berkeley,
the judges will he instructed to
designate the best three debaters
for the California team, and the
next three for the Nebraska.
