The above report has been ar
ranged to show as far as possible
the expense of conducting each
branch of athletics. The football
accounts represent expenses in
curred last semester, all of which
have now been cleared up.
So far this semester, the greatest
loss has been in baseball. With a
present deficit of over a hundred
dollars and a hundred more in
bills yet to be paid, it will be seen
that this branch of athletics is very
expensive. One reason for the
poor showing in receipts is the bad
weather in the early part of the
season, which necessitated the post
ponement of games which would
have paid well. In order to put
baseball on a paying basis it will
be necessary to economize in every
way possible during the rest of the
season.
The track expenses can be easily
cleared with the receipts of the in
tercollegiate meet at Berkeley, as
these should be eight hundred dol
lars in excess of last year's re
ceipts on our own campus. The
preliminary meets have never paid
and everything depends upon the
final intercollegiate meet.
With a balance of but $1036.81
and bills amounting to over $300
yet to be paid, it will be seen that
it will be difficult to close the sea
son with a favorable balance. The
musical clubs have decided to take
a tour during the Easter vacation
and will give a return concert in
the Assembly Hall on April 13th,
the night of the second intercollegi
ate baseball game, in order to pay
off the debt of $319 which they owe
the student body. In addition to
this the popular farce, "Seven
Dobbers Down," will be given un
der the auspices of the Associated
Students on April 19th. With a
reasonable patronage from the stu
dent body these entertainments
should put the treasury in good
condition. John T. Noursk,
Treasurer.
