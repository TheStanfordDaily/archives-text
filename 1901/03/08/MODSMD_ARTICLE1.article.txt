# BASEBALL PROGRESS.
## Players Weak in Batting.â€”Game Tomorrow Between Varsity and Fireman's Fund. 
### 
The past week has found the
baseball men hard at work trying
to overcome some of their weak
nesses and brushing up on
the finer points of the game. The
one particular in which the team
as a whole is weak is in batting,
and most of the practice has been
devoted to the improvement of this
important part of the game. Our
failure to bunch hits in the prac
tice games is largely due to the
fact that only Cowden, Edwards,
and Murphy are batting in Var
sity form. The hitting of the rest
of the team is not only weak from
the standpoint of average, but is
very scattered.
The battery is still in a stage of
development. Barker, who has
made wonderful progress in tossing
the sphere and distanced all his
competitors, has yet much to learn
in determining beforehand the
course which the ball is going to
take. The use of curves and al
ternation of speed are acquire
ments which Barker has yet to
master before he faces the Berke
ley batsman. Behind the bat the
contest for Varsity backstop hon
ors is still close between Traeger
and Ball, and although the latter
is at present the first choice, a
change may come about in a few
days. Traeger can undoubtedly
snap the ball to bags better than
Ball, but when it comes to squeez
ing the sphere in the mit Ball has
a decided advantage. In blocking
men while sliding for home Traeg
er's build gives a great advantage.
The personnel of the outfield is
still a matter of some slight doubt.
Murphy's fast fielding, base run
ning, and hitting make him a cer
tainty for center-field, while the
contest for the other two gardens
will be between Symonds, Lowen
thal, and Brown. They are all
sure fielders, and the two that show
the best work with the stick will
make the places.
Tomorrow afternoon the Varsity
will play the Fireman's Fund
team, the third game of the series.
Each team has won one game, and
the contest tomorrow should draw
a large crowd to the oval. As Berk
eley played the Firemen last Satur
day, the game tomorrow gives us
an opportunity for a comparison
The Varsity are in their best form
and should make matters warm for
the visitors.
The line-up will be as follows:
STANFORD. FIREMAN'S FUND.

Cowden 1 b. . . Follansbee
Misner '2 b Collins
