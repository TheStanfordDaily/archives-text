Tomokrow evening Stanford will,
for the first time in its history,
choose two intercollegiate debating
teams at the same try-out. Not
withstanding the intention of the
Debating League to make no dis
tinction between the teams, the
Executive Committee's stipulation
that the Nebraska debate should
not be allowed to interfere with
our chances against California
makes such distinction necessary.
The Berkeley team will be com
posed of the three men who make
the best showing and the Nebraska
team will consist of the three next
in order.
One trio will meet our neighbor
and natural rival, the University
of California; the second will ven
ture into a new field in going to
Nebraska, one of the growing in
stitutions of the Middle West, a col
lege having a student body much
larger than our own, and having
given considerable more attention
to forensic contests.
Our acceptance of the Nebraska
challenge marks a new era in Stan
ford debating. It is a step beyond
the system which has brought
forward each year only three or
four first-rank men. It broadens
our field and brings us in contact
with universities east of the moun
tains. Already the stimulus is be
ing felt. In the finals tomorrow
evening there will be twelve con
testants, four of whom have made
previous teams as regular members
or as alternates, while the remain
ing eight enter directly from the
preliminaries. From these twelve
men, six will be chosen for the
teams and two for alternates. It
is safe to say that every man of the
twelve has a fighting chance for
one of these positions, and this fact
promises the most hotly contested
and best preliminary debates ever
held here.
With a student body the size of
ours, we should develop several

intercollegiate teams each year, j
In the University there are regis
tered 180 law students, and yet it:
will be noted that only one member
of the recent Carnot team was from
that department. With the adop
tion of our broader policy, we may
soon hope to meet not only Califor
nia and Nebraska, but Washing
ton, which has already challenged
us, and other institutions. And if
these debates are made regular
events, it is to be hoped that each |
Varsity team will be placed on an I
equal footing, in justice both to the
debaters and toother universities.
