# Freshmen Defeated.
## 
### 
The Belmont School defeated the
Freshman baseball team at Bel
mont yesterday afternoon hy a
score of 22 to 14. The work of
hoth teams was exceedingly ragged,
though Belmont surpassed the
Freshmen in hatting. The latter
were unable to connect with the
hall when hits were needed. An
other game will probably be played
i n the near future.
