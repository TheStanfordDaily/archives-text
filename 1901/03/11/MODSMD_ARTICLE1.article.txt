# TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
## Roth and Adams Win Semi-Finals. Best Player to Be Decided Upon Wednesday. 
### 
The tennis try-out last Saturday
morning to determine the best
.single player in college was not
finished, but would probably have
been won by Roth, who defeated
Adams in the first set of the finals
by a score of 6-2, and did not play
the remaining ones. The match
will be played off some time this
week, probably next \\ ednesday.
Another try-out will be held on
Saturday to secure the second best
single player for the meet with Ber
keley. The winner of the Roth-
Adams match will make the Var
sity team without having to play
in this tournament.
Most of the sets in Saturday's
try-out were close, lively, and well
worth seeing. Following are the
drawings and scores of the differ
ent matches: In the first court,
Hall, '03, beat Thompson, '01, 6-2,
6-3, but defaulted to Baker, '03,
who drew the bye. In the second
court, Adams defeated F. A. Leib,
'02, 6-2, 6-4, and R. C. Leib, '03,
6-1, 6-1, and then defeated Baker
in the semi-finals, 6-2, 7-5. In
the third court, R. C. Leib beat
Roseberry, '02, 6-2, 6-4, and was
then defeated by Adams. In the
fourth court, Roth, '03, defeated
Weihe, '03, by default, and Gage,
'03, by a score of 6-2, 7-5. In the
fifth court, Gage won from Boyle,
6-2, 6-4, but was defeated by Roth
iu the semi-finals. This left
Adams, '04, and Roth, 03, for the
finals. Roth won one set by a
score of 6-2. The players then
stopped for lunch and the match
was not finished.
The best sets last Saturday were
the semi-final ones between Adams
and Baker, Roth and Gage. Adams
and Roth played up to their usual
good form. Baker put up a good,
fast game, holding Adams down to
the close score of 7-5 in the second
set. The playing of Gage was a
surprise to everyone. His eye was
quick and his hand was sure and
fast, and he gave Roth all he could
do in another close set of 7-5. If
he stays with it he ought to make
an excellent player.
