# FOUNDER'S DAY EXERCISES.
## Charles F. Lummis Delivers a Noteworthy Address on Education. 
### 
Eight hundred students gathered ;
in Assembly Hall Friday evening!
to witness the exercises commem
orative of the University's founders.
President Jordan presided, and
after music by a well-trained
chorus, he introduced Charles F.
Lummis of Los Angeles as the
speaker, the subject being "Edu
cation." As usual in the case of
any topic the "Lion" grapples with,
every sentence was full of color
and pregnant with suggestiveness.
Education was treated not as an
abstract theme, nor merely from
the standpoint of the learned in
books, but from the vantage
ground of active experience. The
drift may be gleaned from these few
extracts:
"Education is liberty and cannot
exist without it. It is a drawing
forth, not of the emotions nor of
the memory, but of the ability to
see things in their true proportions,
and to make use of them as their
value justifies. The test of the
value of an education is not what
we learn in facts, but what we
know in terms of wise actions. It
is not what we eat, hut what we
are that counts. The university
can provide food, but it cannot di
gest it for you. The lumber pile
of facts should be so sorted that
you can easily find what you want.
Education can develop the mind,
but it cannot change the heart,
and what the individual needs is a
sincerity of purpose.
"No one is educated who is over
mastered by his environment. Man
must he bigger than anything that
can happen to him, for man is not
a happening. The law of gravita
tion is no curtailment of our liber
ties. Freedom—even academic
freedom —is to do only what be
comes a man. More than that no
one should ask for.
"To see things as they are in
their proper relations is in itself ail
education. No man commits a
crime who foresees the results of
his acts. The criminal sees only
himself.
"Every man who is educated
will work. He will see that hon
esty is more than not taking his
neighbor's goods. His duty to
make some return to the world will
be recognized."
In closing, Mr. Lummis attested
his regard for the University and
its founders in these words:
"When a man becomes weak and
decrepit through the ravages of
time we must pity him, but when
an institution lakes on the features
of age it is to be severely criticised.
I love Stanford University because
it is free and noble and not a time
server. VVe cannot permit its
ideals to become narrow, flabby,
and slothful. This college atmo
sphere, this aggregation of noble
buildings, stand as the monument
of two loving parents who gave all
that other children might reap
that education which their own son
was not permitted to eni'oy."
