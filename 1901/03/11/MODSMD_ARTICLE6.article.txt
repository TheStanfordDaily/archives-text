# SATURDAY'S GAME.
## Varsity Defeated by Fireman's Fund in a Poor Exhibition of Baseball. 
### 
The game Saturday between Fire
man's Fund and Stanford, was a
poor exhibition of ball playing for
this period of the season. The Fire
men played a loose game in the
field, but hit the ball hard. The
Varsity did not work well together,
and several of the runs which the
Firemen scored would not have
been made but for errors.
One of the notable features of the
game was the inability of our men
to hit the ball, Captain Edwards
getting three of the four hits made.
During the first few innings Krug
made no effort to pitch, but in spite
of that fact the men did not land
squarely on the hall. It seems
that Krug's reputation alone pulled
him through, for in regular practice
the Varsity has never failed to hit
such pitching.
Although Parker allowed fourteen
hits be showed good improvement,
fielding his position in perfect
shape, and striking out four men.
His control was also good, only
walking one man. Ball showed up
well as catcher, not allowing a
passed ball. Fol lowing is the score:
fireman's fund.
