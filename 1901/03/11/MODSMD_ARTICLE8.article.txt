# DEBATING TEAMS CHOSEN.
## Men Who Will Represent Stanford Against California and Nebraska. 
### 
As a result of the iinal try-out
held in the chapel Saturday night
eight men were chosen to represent
Stanford in the intercollegiate de
hates with the universities of Cali
fornia and Nebraska. The judges,
Professors Miller, Newcomer, and
Whittier, selected as the team to
meet Berkeley, William A. Morris,
'01, Cecil M. Marrack, '01, William
C.Morrow, '01; alternate, Edward
W. Rice, '02.
The four men to face Nebraska
in its debate with Stanford are J.
Frank English, '01, Edwin H.
Williams, '03, Albert N. Merritt,
'01; alternate, Herbert C.Jones,'o2.
The tone of the contests was on
the whole excellent, the struggle
for places being unusually fierce.
The Intercollegiate question was
debated.
The Debating Committee received
a letter from the Nebraskans Sat
urday acceding to our proposals.
They ask that the provisional date
be set for May 10th, which will lie
too close to the semester's end for
our convenience, and will there
fore have to be fixed at an earlier
time, probably May Ist. The
question is to be selected from a
list submitted by Stanford, and
sides will be chosen by lot.
