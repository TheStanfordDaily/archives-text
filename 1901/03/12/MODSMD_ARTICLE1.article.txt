# PRESIDENT MC KINLEY
## Will Visit the University May 14th and Will Probably Address the Students. 
### 
President McKinlev will visit
Stanford and will probably ad
dress the students in Assembly
Hall, May 14th. The announce
ment comes as an agreeable sur
prise, for although it was known
that the President during his Cali
fornia tour would speak at the
University of California and at
San Jose, his itinerary as previous
ly arranged had included no stop
off at Palo Alto. But that the
University will be honored by the
chief magistrate's presence is now
a certainty. On May 14th he will
greet the people of San Jose at a
Carnival of Roses held in his
honor, and will then proceed to
San Francisco, his only stop be
tween the two cities being at the
University. The governor of Ohio
and several other figures of nation
al prominence who are to witness
the launching of the battleship
Ohio on May 19th may accompany
him.
The University has been asked
to share in the celebration to be
held in San Jose, and President
Jordan in accordance with that
request has named a student com
mittee to confer with the Execu
tive Committee in San Jose. The
self-explanatory letter has been re
ceived by student body President
Marrack:
