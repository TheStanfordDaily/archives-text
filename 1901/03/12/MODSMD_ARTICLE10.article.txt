# Tomorrow's "Sequoia."
## 
### 
"The Geology in the Neighbor
hood of Stanford University," by
Ralph Arnold, '99, is the opening
article in the twenty-eight page
Sequoia which will be out tomor
row. A double-page illustrative
map accompanies the article.
"The Wooing of Francieca," the
story of the number, is one of the
prettiest love stories by a college
writer while the last chapter of
"Priest's Point," concludes an excel
lent historical story. "The Rain
bow Quest," Renaud's new poem, is
worthy of attention as an exquisite
lyric. The Desert Island discus
sion is carried on entertainingly
by Dr. Angell, who makes some
humorous criticism of the preced
ing papers of the series.
