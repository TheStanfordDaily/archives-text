The Choral Society is to be con
gratulated 011 the excellent showing
made at the Founder's Day Exer
cises last Friday evening. The
numbers rendered showed the re
sults of thorough and intelligent
training. The rather exceptional
spirit of life and spontaneity which
marks their singing is in decided
contrast to the customary mechani
cal interpretation so often noticed
in similar organizations, which in
dicates that the members find a
real enjoyment in their singing.
The society will be a prominent
feature at the Commencement Exer
cises in May, and all those having
vocal talent are invited to join with
them in making the part of the
Choral Society an unqualified suc
cess.
