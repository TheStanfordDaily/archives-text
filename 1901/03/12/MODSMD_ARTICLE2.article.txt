# Training Rules.
## 
### 
Dr. Murphy has drawn up a set
of training rules, which were
signed last night hy the members
of the haseball team. These rules
require those signing them to ab
stain from liquor and tobacco and
to keep early hours as well as to
be careful about eating. This is a
new departure at Stanford, as base
ball men have not heretofore been
subject to training rules, but Dr.
Murphy has seen the pood effects
of a rigorous course of training on
Eastern baseball teams and their
enforcement will be insisted on.
Similar rules will be signed by all
members of the track squad.
