The tournament of singles has
proved so successful that Mr.
Storey has decided to have the
gymnasium students compete in a
handball tournament of doubles.
This series of games will begin next
week and all handball players
should choose their partners at
once. This choice is confined to
class-mates: only members of the
same cbiss will be allowed to play
together. Thus any possible com
bination of crack players will he
prevented, and the tournament
will accordingly be more interesting
and much closer.
Several games in the semi-finals
of the handball tournament were
played today. Frisselle, '03, de
feated Martin, '03, after a very hard
and exciting match. Martin won
the first game by one point. Fris
selle, however, had the advantage
in the next two games, as the score
of 21-9,21-14 shows. Pollard,'o3,
and Copp, '03, who won from Den
ton by default, played a very close
match, Copp winning, 21-9, 16-21,
21-18. Cromwell, '04, will play
Harkins, '02, and Lousley, '01,
Marx, '01, tomorrow afternoon.
Dunn, '04, will play the
winner of the match between
Marx and Lousley. The better of
these two will then play Copp.
Frisselle will meet the winner of
the Harkins-Cromwell match. All
these contests will be played dur
ing the week, so that by Saturday
two men will be left to play the
final game.
