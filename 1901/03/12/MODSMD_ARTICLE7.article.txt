# "IMMORTALITY."
## Professor Bakewell of Berkeley Delivers a Thoughtful Sunday Morning Address. 
### 
Services in the chapel Sunday
were conducted by Rev. Charles M.
Bakewell of Berkeley. He read
several extracts from the writings
of Socrates as introductory to his
sermon on "Immortality." Ex
tracts from his sermon, the full
value of which appears with reflec
tion, are as follows:
"It is a mark of heroism to do
what lies before one. Of all re
ligious beliefs of mankind there is
none more universal than the be
lief in the life hereafter; it is this
belief that has called forth all the
subtlety of philosophers. As long
as the earth was thought to be the
center of the universe, it was not
strange to suppose that the uni
verse existed for man's satisfaction;
but when our world was found to
be but one of many solar systems,
beliefs changed.
"The belief in immortality of the
human soul is no longer necessary
for morality. Men now are not so
solicitous of the hereafter as once.
Existence is a duty if it last but
for a moment. To spend one's
self, to cast one's bread upon the
waters and not to expect it to re
turn buttered, to be good to the
poor for the duty's sake and not
because we expect a reward, seems
at times to be the better morality,
especially after some disappoint
ment, when we glory in the pros
pect of a larger, happier humanity
realizing what we as individuals
cannot attain.
"Reason offers an explanation of
immortality, and here we can fol
low the guidance of Socrates, the
first who clearly realized a rational
proof of immortality and because
lie came upon the heels of a skepti
cism as great as that of our own
day. His purpose was not to lay
down a doctrine, but to so stimu
late the mind that it cannot but
find the truth. He put complete
thought for partial thought. His
argument was this: that unless the
soul does not belong wholly to the
changing world of things, unless it
belongs to the world beyond change,
genuine knowledge is beyond our
scope; but we have knowledge, and
so the soul cannot be thought to be
the product of the changing world.
He was not a refined Epicurean,
but the apostle of greater progress
of virtue, wisdom, and power, who
wanted only the wages of going
on."
