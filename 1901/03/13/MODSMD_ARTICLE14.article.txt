Friday afternoon several very
important amendments to the con
stitution of the Associated Students
will be voted upon. One of these
takes most of the work from the
different managers and gives it to
the treasurer. Under the new ar
rangement, the treasurer will not
need to register as a student. Some
change of this kind was considered
necessary in view of the inroads
made by the faculty upon the man
agerial ranks last semester. The
new plan will not give us a grad
uate manager system like that of
the University of California, where
one man looks after every branch
of student activities. It only gives
the treasurer more to do and no
longer requires him to take Uni
versity work. The second amend
ment increases the salary of the
treasurer to one thousand dollars a
year, but allows no personal ex
penses other than railroad fares.
We publish a statement in another
column showing that this will
really diminish the expense of the
Associated Students about three
hundred dollars. It is a great temp
tation to treasurers and managers at
the present time to run up much
larger expense accounts than there
is any need of, and under the new
plan, when it will be their own loss,
they will probably be more econom
