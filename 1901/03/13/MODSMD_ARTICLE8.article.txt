# THE 						FISHES OF HAWAII.
## President Jordan and Dr. Jenkins to Supervise Investigations in a New Scientific Field. 
### 
President Jordan and I)r. 0. P.
Jenkins of ihe Physiology depart
ment have been appointed by the
United States Fish Commission
to the special commission which is
to investigate the fishes and fish
laws of the Hawaiian Islands. On
the board with them are B. F. Ever
mann of Washington, J). C., who
pursued graduate work here in '92
after receiving his degree from
Indiana University; Messrs. Golds
borough and Moore, two scientists
of Washington; and artist Hudson.
It is possible that several Stanford
students may accompany the ex
pedition, but nothing is yet as
sured as to the funds that will be
placed at the scientists' disposal.
Dr. Jordan will leave the Uni
versity in May, and during the
summer will have personal charge
of the work. He will return in the
fall and leave the investigations to
be completed under Dr. Evermann's
direction. During the winter the
Albatross will be pressed into ser
vice, and no pains will be spared
by the government to make the
commission's work complete. Little
is known of Hawaiian ichthyology,
and it is certain that the collections
of specimens secured, which are to
be ultimately classified in the Uni
versity laboratories, will be the
source of much valuable knowl
edge in the department of science.
