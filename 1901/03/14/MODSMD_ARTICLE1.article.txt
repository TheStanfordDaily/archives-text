# GEOLOGY SOCIETY.
## The 						Stanford Organization Takes the Initiative in Forming a National League. 
### 
The Geology Society of this Uni
versity has taken the initiative in
forming a national league, to be
known as the "Geological Society
of American Universities." A let
ter and constitution has been pre
pared and sent to the department
of geology or mining at the follow
ing universities and schools of
mines: University of Wisconsin;
Lehigh University; University of
Michigan (Ann Arbor); Univer
sity of Chicago; University of Min
nesota; Cornell University; Colum
bia University; Yale University;
Harvard University; University of
Pennsylvania; School of Mines,
Houghton, Michigan; University
of California; Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, and Johns
Hopkins UDiversity.
The letter, which gives all of the
aims and purposes of the new or
ganization, is printed below:
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Sir: —The members of the
Geological Society at Stanford Uni
versity, acting upon the suggestion
of Drs. Branner and J. P. Smith of
the Departmen, of Geology, have
been considering the possibility of
forming a general geological society
among the students of the various
American universities and schools
of mines having efficient depart
ments of geology or mining. The
members of the society believe thtt
the desirability of such an organi
zation can not be doubted, as it
would form a basis for an acquaint
anceship among students in geo
logy and mining which cannot but
be a benefit and a pleasure to them.
Acting on this belief, the society
has appointed us a committee for
drawing up a plan for such an or
ganization, to be submitted tenta
tively to the students of other uni
versities. The plan we have de
vised has been embodied in a gen
eral constitution providing for a
"Geological Society of American
Universities," and we have taken
the liberty of addressing you and
enclosing a copy of this "constitu
tion" in the hope that you would be
sufficiently interested in it to lay
the matter before such of your stu
dents* as would be eligible to the so
ciety. For the most part, the rea
sons for the various articles and
sections of this constitution will be
evident to those familiar with the
workings of such societies, and a
further explanation of them would
lie unnecessary. There are prob
ably some parts the reasons for
which will not be so evident, and a
brief explanation of some of them
will be set forth.
The name, "The Geological So
ciety of American Universities,"
was adopted after considerable dis
rtission as being the only one pre
sented which would serve to indi
cate the exact nature of the society
it was desired to form. For the
local branches, "section" was
thought to be a good designation,
jis it is also a word of geological
significance.
"Article 11. — Membership" is
probably the most important devi
ation from ordinary constitutions

that the committee lias made, and
to properly explain the reasons
for such innovations as it may
contain, it will he necessary to give
a short account of the present geo
logical society at Stanford and of
the one that preceded it. For
some years there had been a geo
logical society here, hut its work
was very inefficient, and about
three years ago it died out com
pletely. Practically all the stu
dents of the department were mem
bers of it, and but little interest
was taken in its meetings. A little
over a year ago, some of the stu
dents of the department, acting
upon the srggestion of Dr. Bran
ner, formed the present society,
which has been since then, and is
now, in a most flourishing condi
tion. The members derive consid
erable benefit from attendance at
the meetings, absentees are the ex
ception, and it is considered an
honor to be elected a member of it.
The society has aimed to take in
such men only as really strengthen
it, and to that end has made su
perior scholarship a requisite. All
nominations to active membership
are based on the nominee's record
as a student, and are made by the
head of the Department of Geology.
A three-fourths vote is then re
quired to elect. This has had the
effect of practically making it a
senior and graduate society,
though the membership is not so
limited, for it is intended to take
in men who enter the University
possessing geological or mining ex
perience and are considered other
wise eligible. The society has been
made a social as well as a techni
cal organization; the meetings be
ing held for the most part at the
rooms or homes of its members.
Some member is assigned
by the president to read a
paper or give a talk con
cerning some geological problem
be may have worked up; or to de
scribe a mine which he has visited
or in which he has worked. All
papers or talks must be based on
the speaker's own experience or
work.
The society ascribes its prosper
ity to these conditions of member
ship, and we have therefore
incorporated them in the general
constitution.
As it would probably be impos
sible for the society to begin to
hold annual meetings at once, pro
vision has been made for voting by
proxy, in order that the business
of the society may be transacted by
correspondence until such time as
it is thought best to hold conven
tions in the regular way.
The society at Stanford has in
dorsed the enclosed constitution
and has organized under it by
drawing up a local constitution
and by-laws, a cop}' of which is
also inclosed.
Should your students be suffi
ciently interested to correspond
with us in the matter, we would be
glad to have them do so.

"Article 11. — Membership" is
probably the most important devi
ation from ordinary constitutions

that the committee lias made, and
to properly explain the reasons
for such innovations as it may
contain, it will he necessary to give
a short account of the present geo
logical society at Stanford and of
the one that preceded it. For
some years there had been a geo
logical society here, hut its work
was very inefficient, and about
three years ago it died out com
pletely. Practically all the stu
dents of the department were mem
bers of it, and but little interest
was taken in its meetings. A little
over a year ago, some of the stu
dents of the department, acting
upon the srggestion of Dr. Bran
ner, formed the present society,
which has been since then, and is
now, in a most flourishing condi
tion. The members derive consid
erable benefit from attendance at
the meetings, absentees are the ex
ception, and it is considered an
honor to be elected a member of it.
The society has aimed to take in
such men only as really strengthen
it, and to that end has made su
perior scholarship a requisite. All
nominations to active membership
are based on the nominee's record
as a student, and are made by the
head of the Department of Geology.
A three-fourths vote is then re
quired to elect. This has had the
effect of practically making it a
senior and graduate society,
though the membership is not so
limited, for it is intended to take
in men who enter the University
possessing geological or mining ex
perience and are considered other
wise eligible. The society has been
made a social as well as a techni
cal organization; the meetings be
ing held for the most part at the
rooms or homes of its members.
Some member is assigned
by the president to read a
paper or give a talk con
cerning some geological problem
be may have worked up; or to de
scribe a mine which he has visited
or in which he has worked. All
papers or talks must be based on
the speaker's own experience or
work.
The society ascribes its prosper
ity to these conditions of member
ship, and we have therefore
incorporated them in the general
constitution.
As it would probably be impos
sible for the society to begin to
hold annual meetings at once, pro
vision has been made for voting by
proxy, in order that the business
of the society may be transacted by
correspondence until such time as
it is thought best to hold conven
tions in the regular way.
The society at Stanford has in
dorsed the enclosed constitution
and has organized under it by
drawing up a local constitution
and by-laws, a cop}' of which is
also inclosed.
Should your students be suffi
ciently interested to correspond
with us in the matter, we would be
glad to have them do so.

The Geology Society of this Uni
versity has taken the initiative in
forming a national league, to be
known as the "Geological Society
of American Universities." A let
ter and constitution has been pre
pared and sent to the department
of geology or mining at the follow
ing universities and schools of
mines: University of Wisconsin;
Lehigh University; University of
Michigan (Ann Arbor); Univer
sity of Chicago; University of Min
nesota; Cornell University; Colum
bia University; Yale University;
Harvard University; University of
Pennsylvania; School of Mines,
Houghton, Michigan; University
of California; Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, and Johns
Hopkins UDiversity.
The letter, which gives all of the
aims and purposes of the new or
ganization, is printed below:
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Sir: —The members of the
Geological Society at Stanford Uni
versity, acting upon the suggestion
of Drs. Branner and J. P. Smith of
the Departmen, of Geology, have
been considering the possibility of
forming a general geological society
among the students of the various
American universities and schools
of mines having efficient depart
ments of geology or mining. The
members of the society believe thtt
the desirability of such an organi
zation can not be doubted, as it
would form a basis for an acquaint
anceship among students in geo
logy and mining which cannot but
be a benefit and a pleasure to them.
Acting on this belief, the society
has appointed us a committee for
drawing up a plan for such an or
ganization, to be submitted tenta
tively to the students of other uni
versities. The plan we have de
vised has been embodied in a gen
eral constitution providing for a
"Geological Society of American
Universities," and we have taken
the liberty of addressing you and
enclosing a copy of this "constitu
tion" in the hope that you would be
sufficiently interested in it to lay
the matter before such of your stu
dents* as would be eligible to the so
ciety. For the most part, the rea
sons for the various articles and
sections of this constitution will be
evident to those familiar with the
workings of such societies, and a
further explanation of them would
lie unnecessary. There are prob
ably some parts the reasons for
which will not be so evident, and a
brief explanation of some of them
will be set forth.
The name, "The Geological So
ciety of American Universities,"
was adopted after considerable dis
rtission as being the only one pre
sented which would serve to indi
cate the exact nature of the society
it was desired to form. For the
local branches, "section" was
thought to be a good designation,
jis it is also a word of geological
significance.
"Article 11. — Membership" is
