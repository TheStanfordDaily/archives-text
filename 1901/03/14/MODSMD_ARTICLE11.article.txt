Rooting at the baseball game
yesterday, although far from being
spirited, was sufficiently improved
to be in pleasing contrast with that
of last Saturday. This may have
been due to the closeness of the
contest, but it reminds us that
with the baseball season on, and
the field-day and debates ap
proaching, the time is ripe for the
Rooters' Club to accomplish its
mission. We were given a forcible
lesson at the Carnot debate, by the
small crowd of Berkeley students
present, of the advantage in united
and organized cheering.
