There is a promising field for
the Geological Society of American
Universities, and if the letter sent
by the Stanford Geology Club to
leading institutions of the country
meets with the favor anticipated,
it will result in a national organi
zation of wide influence. The plan
is given in the letter, published
elsewhere in this issue. Encour
aged by its own success, and realiz
ing the value of federating similar
clubs in different universities, the
local club has acted upon the advice
of Dr. Branner and Dr. Smith, and
has taken the initiative in this
movement. It is fitting that the
idea should originate here, for at
no other place in the country is the
study of geological problems ac
companied by natural advantages
so favorable.
