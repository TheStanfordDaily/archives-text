Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In justice to those students de
siring to submit manuscripts in
the Senior Farce competition I wish
to protest, through your columns,
against the decision of the Farce
Committee to weigh the merits of
the farces themsveles.
The Senior Class president un
doubtedly showed great discretion
in placing on this committee men
whose talents in this direction we
all admit, but this very fact points
out the selection of faculty judges as
the only delicate course open to the
committee. The immediate effect of
the committee's recent action will
be to discourage competition, and
as one who might like to submit a
manuscript, 1 would urge the wis
dom of abiding by the original ex
press condition of the Finance Com
mittee, —that the relative merits of
the farces should lie decided by
members of the faculty. To en
courage open competition the
Farce Committee should act at
once. An Advocate of Justick.
