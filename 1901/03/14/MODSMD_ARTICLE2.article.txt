# YESTERDAY'S GAME.
## Varsity Wins in the Eleventh Inning.—Contest a Very Poor Exhibition of Baseball. 
### 
For three hours yesterday after
noon the Varsity and the team
from the State Normal School of
San Jose played tag with each
other in the oval. The game was
finally won by the Varsity after it
had become too dark for the play
ers to find the ball. In the elev
enth inning, with one gone, Sy
monds knocked a long drive
against the right-field fence for
three bags, and then rested on third
base until Martin threw the ball
against the backstop. While the
Normal catcher was making a
search for the lost sphere, Symonds
came home, scoring the winning
run of what was the poorest played
game that the Varsity has ever
been engaged in.
The home players went about
their work without any life what
ever, and with the exception of
Captain Edwards and one or two
others did not seem to care whether
the game was lost or not. Half the
time no coacher was on the line,
and when a man did go out he
would usually find a soft place to
lie down, and would amuse him
self throwing pebbles. The farce
which occurred after the center
fielder caught Symonds off second
base was entirely due to the care
lessness of the coacher, who should
have warned the runner. Follow
ing is the score:
