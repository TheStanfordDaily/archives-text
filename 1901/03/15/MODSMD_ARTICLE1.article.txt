# AMENDMENT CARRIED.
## Associated Students Increase the Powers and Duties of the Treasurer. 
### 
At a well-attended meeting of the
Associated Students this afternoon
I'resident Marrack, after the rend
ing of the minutes of the last meet
ing, explained his communication
in yesterday's Daily Palo Alto,
saying in response to inquiries by
Hyde, '01, that he had sent the
telegram to Governor Gage hastily,
because the bill would come before
the governor this morning, and
that he had done this only after
consulting each member of the Ex
ecutive Committee. Marrack then
asked that this action be ratified
by the student body. It was
moved by Nourse, '00, and seconded
Naramore, '08, that such action
be supported by the student body.
Hyde spoke condemning Marrack's
action, but the motion was carried.
The proposed amendments were
then brought forward, and Decarli,
'01, moved that the first of them
be adopted. J. T. Nourse moved to
amend these by striking out the
amendment to Section 6, and by
inserting in the amendment to Sec
lion 5 the words, ''The treasurer
shall be empowered to appoint such
assistants as he shall find neces
sary"; this motion being carried.
This motion will do away with the
managers of the different athletic
interests, giving the treasurer com
plete authority. The whole amend
ment was next carried unani
mously.
The amendment reads as it now
stands:
"Article 11, Section 1, of the con
stitution of the Associated Students
to be amended to read as follows:
' and a treasurer, who
shall be a graduate of and shall
have attended the University at
least three years.' Section 5 to be
stricken out and the following sub
stituted: 'The treasurer shall col
lect and have charge of the funds
of the Association, and shall, upon
recommendation of the president
or of the Executive Committee,
enter into all contracts, whether
for services or labor, in which the
Association is a party; and shall
have sole charge of the purchasing
of supplies and of the scheduling of
games. The treasurer shall secure
vouchers, in the form used by the
United States government, for all
expenditures, and shall procure a
detailed statement of all receipts,
certified to by himself, and, where
ever possible, by other parties con

a detailed report of all expendi
