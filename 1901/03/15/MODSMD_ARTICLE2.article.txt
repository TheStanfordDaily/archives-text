# Handball Notes.
## 
### 
Handball has become so popular
among the gymnasium students
that two courts have been inade
quate. Another court is being
placed in the side hall of the gym
nasium, and the kicking disk
which formerly occupied this space
has been forced out of use. A
hinged wall will cover the side
door where the court is in use.
This wall can be swung to the side
so that the side entrance will not
be entirely blocked.
The final set in the handball
tournament will be played by
Dunn and Frisselle, .Saturday after
noon at two o'clock.
