# BASEBALL NOTES.
## Work of the Past Week Very Disappointing.-Varsity vs. Alumni Tomorrow. 
### 
During the past week the base
ball squad has shown no improve
ment, but has gone from bad to
worse. If the degeneration of the
past two weeks continues, we shall
be unable tQ hold our own with
the neighboring "prep" schools.
Even the fielding of the team,
which has until recently been the
only redeeming feature, has of late
declined and become erratic. The
batting continues weak and the
men seem to have forgotten the
few fundamental points of the
game which they learned early in
the season. An air of absolute in
difference pervades the spirit of
the men on the team, and the work
they have been doing is entirely
in keeping with their spirit. To
find our team in such a condition
one month from the close of the
season is, to say the least, a most
lamentable fact, but it is one that
will not be remedied simply by
mentioning it. The blame firstly
lies with the players and secondly
with the student body. The men
have been given no encouragement
in practice, or even in games, and
the result has been, as could be ex
pected, careless and erratic play
ing. Even a shake-up in the per
sonnel of the team has given no
results.
It is only fair that we except
Captain Edwards from our criti
cisms. He. has worked hard and
consistently the whole season, and
bad we nine such men on the team
there would be no cause for com
plaint. Murphy and Cowden have
also been doing all that could be
expected of them.
The battery at present seems to
be in a very crippled condition
and will have to improve very
rapidly if it is to make even a fair
showing against Berkeley.
The loss of Conner, the clever
third baseman, coming as it does
at a time when the team is going
down hill, and when his services
were most sorely needed, has been
very serious. It is almost impos
sible to replace him.
Tomorrow the Varsity will meet
the Alumni team on the campus.
The game will undoubtedly be
close, and if the Varsity can get
out of their slump they should
win. It will be of great help to
the team to have a large, enthusi
astic attendance to give them some
encouragement.
The teams line up as follows:
VARSITY. ALUMNI.
Parker p Kaarsburg
Ball c Swindells
Cowden lb Young
Mistier 2 b Baird
Brown 3 b McClaren
Edwards ss Fuller
Lowenthal If Morse
Murphy c 112 . . . Havens
Symonds r 112 Gazelinski
