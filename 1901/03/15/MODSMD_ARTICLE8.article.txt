Today's action of the Associated
Students in passing the constitu
tional amendments is deserving of
censure as well as praise. It has
long heen seen that for efficiency
and economy, the concentration of
authority in the bands of a grad
uate treasurer was imperative. This
needed reform was introduced, and
the treasurers-prospective were giv
en an outline of their future duties.
So far well and good, and commen
dation he to the meeting for its
unanimity of sentiment. Hut that
the railroading through of the last
clause of the second amendment
should have been allowed, is a
matter of surprise. Was it not
seen that the innocent-looking
words "the treasurer shall he em
powered to appoint such assist
ants as he shall find neces
sary," give to one man almost
despotic power? In the treasurer's
hands has been placed an unlim
ited amount of patronage, which
can be productive of no lasting
benefit. The clause was both un
wise and unnecessary. As prev
iously published the amendment
was perfectly satisfactory, and the
introduction of the new reading at
the last moment, with a plea that
the same plan was in vogue at
Berkeley as its only excuse, was an
action worthy of considerable re
flection.
