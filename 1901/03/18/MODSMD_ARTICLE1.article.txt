# ALUMNI DEFEATED.
## Varsity Shows Improvement and Wins a Close Game in the Tenth Inning. 
### 
Many long hits, an extra inning,
and a very close score made the
baseball" game Saturday a very in
teresting exhibition, at least from
the spectator's point of view. The
fielding on the whole was poor, the
Alumni being erratic throughout
the game, while the Varsity had
their customary bad innings.
The Alumni team was much
weaker than the Saturday before,
when they were beaten by Berke
ley. The good showing that they
made against the Varsity was
largely due to the excellent work
of Kaarsburg and Swindells. The
Varsity showed considerable im
provement over their last game,
i)ut seemed to go to pieces at times.
The hitting of the Varsity was the
best seen this season.
The umpiring, which in some of
the past games has been extremely
unsatisfactory, was well taken care
of by Prof. B. E. Howard. He of
ficiated in clean style, and it is to
lie regretted that the action of some
of the Alumni caused him to with
draw after the game was practi
cally over.
The best work on the Varsity
was done by Barker, Misner, Ed
wards, and Lowenthal, while Swin
dells, Kaarsburg, and Lanagun did
most of the work for the visitors.
Swindell's circus catch and Lana
gan's throws from short were the
features of the game.
The Varsity started the argu
ment in the second inning and
snatched a lead which the Alumni
never overcame. Misner went to
first on error, Ball got a safety,and
Brown lost the ball out in center
held, scoring three runs. Lowen
thal went to second on the left
tielder's error, and scored on Mur
phy's hit. Murphy, after stealing
two bases, scored on an error. The
Varsity maintained the lead easily
until the fifth inning, when Bar
ker's arm weakened, and the
Alumni piled up five runs. In the
eighth inning the Alumni tied the
score, and no score was made in the
ninth, Cowden scoring the winning
run on the tenth.
