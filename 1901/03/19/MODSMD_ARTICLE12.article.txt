To a candid observer there seems
an amazing lack of interest on the
part of our students in track and
baseball affairs. The bleachers
have not been filled this season,
and the yelling at the late game
with San Jose Normal was so un
expected as to occasion comment.
Even this late in the season there
are seldom more than forty men
out in the afternoons to watch
track-work and baseball. At Berke
ley conditions are in strong con
trast with those. A recent letter
112., i. j. - . |
from a Stanford man now at the
University of California says that
the track is crowded with athletes
every afternoon, that the bleachers
are well filled, and that the spec
tators take a lively interest in
every man out training, applaud
ing when he shows up well in the
trials. Why cannot such spirit be
manifested at Stanford? We want
to win and are willing to do nearly
anything to turn down our rival.
But one may well ask whether
Stanford students are adequately
supporting their athletes just now,
when the track men are most apt
to become discouraged and stale.
We do not always realize the sac
rifices these men make when they
put on their track-suits and strain
and swelter out in the hot sun.
They do not do this because they
like it, nor entirely because they
may win the Varsity "S" sweaters.
Many go in with little show for
even third place, but stay grimly
with it because they feel that it is
their duty to the college. And we
ask the student body to support
these men by filling the bleachers,
by applauding the men when they
do good work, by encouraging them
in private, when the runner or
jumper or man at the weights is
sick of the whole thing and wants
to quit. That is what puts heart
into a man and makes him a win
ner. If we expect victory on the
track or diamond this season, the
students would do well to begin to
accord our men proper encourage
ment.
