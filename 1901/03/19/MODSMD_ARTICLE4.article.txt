# New Reservoir Begun.
## 
### 
For several weeks work has been
progressing steadily on the ex
cavation for the new reservoir to be
constructed on the knoll back of .J.
B. Cooksey's residence. Several

teams and about twenty men are
now employed in hollowing out the
center of the hill. The tank, which
will be circular in form, is to be 120
feet in diameter at the top, tapering
off gradually to a width of IU-i at
the bottom. The walls, two feet in
thickness, will be constructed of
concrete, for which someof the stone,
after first being.crushed and ground
by machinery, will be used. The
size of the reservoir will allow a
margin of some twenty feet of stone
remaining outside the walls to
strengthen them. The tank itself
will hold a million gallons of water
and will probably be some eighteen
feet in depth, extending above the
top of the hill about two or three
feet, only enough to allow for ven
tilation. Patent systems of filter
ing and aeration will be used. The
entire system is contracted to be in
operation by the first of September.
