# CHAPEL SERVICES.
## "Worship," the Subject of a Helpful Sunday Morning Address by Professor Murray. 
### 
Dr. Murray began the sermon
portion of chapel services on Hun
day by reading selections from the
Acts of Apostles (17th chapter), the
first Book of Kings (Bth chapter),
and portions of the writings by the
prophets Isaiah and Malachi.
"These passages," he said, ''sum
up the Scripture teaching of wor
ship; they show how man has
sought to approach God.
"Man's religious life is the ex
pression of his consciousness and
works itself out in his conduct of
life in general. This religious sense
is by no means the same in all
men. It is easy for some to walk
in the ways of justice; their lives
are constant prayers. Some with
the same spirit of insight do not
walk in the light; though they know
the light, they do not live a life of
constant prayer. Perhaps the dif
ference is due to different degrees
of strength and their conception of
God.
"At times the poorest and weak
est turn to thoughts of God. In
the mountains, on the ocean, the
littleness of man's strength sug
gests itself.
"In life's crises we turn to God.
In seasons of sorrow and bereave
ment when life is blank, men pray
who never prayed before; when we
must act in a great emergency,
when one course only points to the
line of duty, when one action of
moral courage is required, in life's
crises when we learn how weak
men are, then the need of strength
is one of the chief causes that lead
to the source of strength, to God.
"The consciousness of God works
itself out in conduct. If a man
realizes his duty, God's holiness, he
cannot willingly walk counter to
the definite consciousness of duty.
"Men worship in different ways
and at different times, but the act
of worship must be very real and
in a very personal way. Some
may worship best in solitude, yet
the atmosphere of devotion makes
the desire for worship stronger.
'If any one would be alone let him
look at the stars.' Yet how near
God is when we stand almost before
tiie face of Infinity â€”and we cannot
look at Infinity without being near
God.
"Worship is the act 011 the part
of the individual expressing his re
lation to God; we leave behind am
bition, hopes, desires; humanly
speaking, we come before God. I
cannot worship for you, nor you
for me; the relations between God
and men are individual.
"Not being with God is not. the
right thing. The indisputable fact
remains that man cannot ilee from
God's presence. Man cannot pray
with unclean lips. Worship must
begin with a conscious endeavor of
the individual soul to come before
God with clean heart and lips, to
put away selfishness, that God in
his providence may direct our
course.
"When we are conscious of God's
presence we are uplifted and
strengthened; our weakness, our
complications fade away; the most

burning desires of our hearts fade
into insignificance and we become
reconciled to his will.
"We need to realize what our
duty is, to turn to our Father for
help, and the chance to see our
duty. I'he righteous life of the
devout man worships daily, is con
stantly strong because constantly
with God.
"It. is the privilege of ever}' man
to he pure in heart and 10 attain
to the knowledge of (Jod."
