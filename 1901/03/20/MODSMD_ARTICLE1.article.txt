# VARSITY WINS.
## Stanford Defeats Santa Clara in the Beat Played Game of the Season.—Score, 12-2. 
### 
By far the best game in which
the Varsity has participated this
season was played on the Santa
Clara grounds yesterday before a
very large number of spectators.
The work of our team was almost
perfect, only three costless errors
being made throughout the game.
Our batting was exceedingly strong,
fourteen safe hits, seven of which
were two-baggers, being accredited
to us. In taking advantage of all
the tine points of the game our
men also showed much improve
ment. There was not one "doppy"
play made throughout the game.
Santa Clara also played a good
game, and was only surpassed by
the Varsity in batting. The Santa
Clara batsmen tried in vain for
five innings to land a man on first
base, but Parker's delivery was too
much for them and they were re
tired in one, two, three order.
Parker's pitching was the feature of
the game and was easily the best
showing any of our pitchers has
made this season, lie only allowed
four scratch scattered hits in nine
innings of play, and was always
cool and steady. Ilis position was
lielded in good style and he did
not. walk a man. The rest of the
team also played good ball and
gave Parker excellent support.
The line-up of the Varsity was
somewhat altered, and if results
count for anything the change was
beneficial. Traeger was put on
first base, Cowden was removed to
center-field, and Murphy was
brought in to third base. The ob
ject of the change is to make a
place for Traeger, whose heavy
stick-work is much needed on the
team. Cowden's playing at first
has been exceedingly good, but he
has the advantage of being able to
play almost any position on the
team in first-class style. He
played the outfield yesterday as
well as if he had been there all
season.
It is difficult to single out any
one besides Parker whose work
should be placed ahead of that of
any either member of the team, but
the playing of diet Murphy and
Hall is worthy of special mention,
('bet's hitting was very strong and
he played a hard, fast game. Ball
caught a good game, hit well, and
handled Parker's speed without a.
passed ball.
For Santa Clara, Farry and Keefe
played the best game.
Stanford closed Santa Clara out
the first five innings, allowing no
man to reach first base. Stanford
started the scoring in the first by a
pretty steal to the plate by Ed
wards. In the second inning a
two-base hit, a single, a base on
balls, and an error netted the Var
sity three runs. No score was
made in the third and fourth in
nings, and in the fifth twotwo-bag
gers resulted in one tally. Stan
ford scored in every inning after
the fourth, two tallies coming in in
the seventh and three in the eighth.
Santa Clara scored one run in the
sixth inning and one in the sev
enth.

The work of our team was almost
perfect, only three costless errors
being made throughout the game.
Our batting was exceedingly strong,
fourteen safe hits, seven of which
were two-baggers, being accredited
to us. In taking advantage of all
the tine points of the game our
men also showed much improve
ment. There was not one "doppy"
play made throughout the game.
Santa Clara also played a good
game, and was only surpassed by
the Varsity in batting. The Santa
Clara batsmen tried in vain for
five innings to land a man on first
base, but Parker's delivery was too
much for them and they were re
tired in one, two, three order.
Parker's pitching was the feature of
the game and was easily the best
showing any of our pitchers has
made this season, lie only allowed
four scratch scattered hits in nine
innings of play, and was always
cool and steady. Ilis position was
lielded in good style and he did
not. walk a man. The rest of the
team also played good ball and
gave Parker excellent support.
The line-up of the Varsity was
somewhat altered, and if results
count for anything the change was
beneficial. Traeger was put on
first base, Cowden was removed to
center-field, and Murphy was
brought in to third base. The ob
ject of the change is to make a
place for Traeger, whose heavy
stick-work is much needed on the
team. Cowden's playing at first
has been exceedingly good, but he
has the advantage of being able to
play almost any position on the
team in first-class style. He
played the outfield yesterday as
well as if he had been there all
season.
It is difficult to single out any
one besides Parker whose work
should be placed ahead of that of
any either member of the team, but
the playing of diet Murphy and
Hall is worthy of special mention,
('bet's hitting was very strong and
he played a hard, fast game. Ball
caught a good game, hit well, and
handled Parker's speed without a.
passed ball.
For Santa Clara, Farry and Keefe
played the best game.
Stanford closed Santa Clara out
the first five innings, allowing no
man to reach first base. Stanford
started the scoring in the first by a
pretty steal to the plate by Ed
wards. In the second inning a
two-base hit, a single, a base on
balls, and an error netted the Var
sity three runs. No score was
made in the third and fourth in
nings, and in the fifth twotwo-bag
gers resulted in one tally. Stan
ford scored in every inning after
the fourth, two tallies coming in in
the seventh and three in the eighth.
Santa Clara scored one run in the
sixth inning and one in the sev
enth.
