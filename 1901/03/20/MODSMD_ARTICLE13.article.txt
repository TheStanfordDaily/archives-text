Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Last Thursday the following tele
grain was sent to Sacramento:
"Governor Henry T. Gaye, Sac
ramento: The Associated Students
of Stanford University respect
fully request your Excellency's
favorable consideration of the Red
wood Park Bill now awaiting your
approval.
Cecil M. Marback, Pres."
Though appearances may he to
the contrary, President Marrack el
even the president plus the Ex
ecutive Committee is not the As
sociated Students of Stanford Uni
versity. That body had taken no
action on the Redwood Park
Bill. Consequently the telegrum
was simply an attempt to influ
ence the governor by a false state
ment. That such an act should
have been subsequently endorsed
by the Associated Students is de
plorable.
The real nature of this act is not
altered by a lack of wrong intent,
nor by the worthy nature of the
bill; nor is the evil modified by
the puerility of the conception that
the governor would be influenced
by an expression of opinion by a
body of immature students who
have showed themselves willing to
vote their approval to almost any
proposition put before them, with
out giving it any thoughtful con
sideration.
It is such trifling with facts, and
such dependence on the future to
straighten out crooked work, which
leads in political and business life
to the production of conscienceless
lobbyists and defaulting bank of
ficials. It is the thoughtless, yet
venal, willingness of the people to
back up their leaders in such work
which introduces the greatest dan
ger into our political life.
It will be wrong beyond meas
ure if a series of presidential prece
dents for the promulgation of false
statements be set at Stanford Uni
versity. A university should be
marked by the greatest alertness of
conscience.
No habit of mind is of greater
value than that of analyzing ac
tions, and calling their elements
by their right names. A univer
sity man should be readily forgiven
for being overzealous, even to the
point of indiscretion, in defending
truth and justice. It should be
absolutely impossible for him to
allow great wrongs to go unre
buked.
If, while being trained here, in
stead of becoming morally sensi
tive, we are overcome by moral
apathy, we shall indeed be cursed.
If at this University men learn to
uphold others in actions which
they know to be wrong, because of
personal friendship or personal in
terest, or because of a fear of "los
ing their heads," or "affecting their
standing in the University"; or if
they learn to uphold a wrong
course of action because of the sup
posed interests of any organization
of which they are a part, this Uni
versity will become a most danger
ous enemy of the State and of hu
manity.
We, who are now a part of Stan
ford University, should do all in
our power to see that such moral
apathy and moral obtuseness, as
recent events have shown,shall not
be allowed to become the spirit of
this institution. James M. Hyde.
