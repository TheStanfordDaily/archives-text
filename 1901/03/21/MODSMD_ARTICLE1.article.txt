# WILL SPEAK HERE.
## President Hadley of Yale Will Address the Students Next Week. 
### 
Arrangements have been made
to have President Arthur Twing
Hadley of Vale University visit
Stanford either Monday or Tues
day of next week and address the
students in the chapel. The exact
day of his coming will not be
known until this evening, when
President Jordan will confer with
President Hadley in San Francis
co. The subject of his address will
be determined at that time.
The president of Yale University
comes to the Coast primarily to de
liver the Charter Day address at
the University of California 011
Saturday, when he will speak on
the subject, "Government by Pub
lic Opinion." President IJadley is
accompanied by his wife, and they
will visit several places of interest
before returning East. This even
ing the Yale Alumni Association of
San Francisco gives a banquet to
him at the Palace Hotel, at which
Dr. Jordan will probably respond
lo a toast.
Dr. Hadley is one of the
most prominent college presi
dents in the United States, and
holds the record of being the
youngest man who ever occupied
the executive chair at Yale Uni
versity, having been called to the
position but two years ago, whmi he
was forty-three years old. His ac
cession to the presidency marked
the beginning of a wide change in
the policy of Yale, for its long line
of distinguished presidents had
previously all been Congregational
ministers. Dr. Hadley had not
been trained for the ministry, but
he appeared to be so eminently the
successor to President Timothy
Dwight that the trustees very read
ily waived the religious precedent.
The distinguished young presi
dent is the son of Professor James
Hadley, who so long occupied the
chair of Greek at Yale and is the
author of Hadley's Greek Gram
mar and numerous other Greek
text-books. The son graduated
from Yale in 1876, and spent the
following three years in graduate
work in economics at Berlin and
New Haven, afterwards becoming a
tutor at his alma mater. After
three years in the latter position,
be resigned to devote himself en
tirely to literary work and econom
ic research. He has gained world
wide recognition from his works on
railroads, and is regarded as one of
the best authorities on railroads
and transportation. So valuable
was his book on railroads consid
ered, that Nicholas 11, Czar of
Russia, made a personal request to
have it translated into Russian in
order that it might serve as an
authority for the government en
gineers who were working 011 the
Siberian railroad project.
From 1885 to 1887 he was
Commissioner of Labor Statistics
for Connecticut, resigning this po
sition to accept the chair of politi
cal economy at Yale, which lie
held until the retirement of Presi
dent Timothy Dwight, whom he
was unanimously chosen to suc
ceed. His presidency has already

been marked by many important
changes, among which is the ex
tension of the elective system.
