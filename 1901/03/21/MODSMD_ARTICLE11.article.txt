Stanford students will luive an
opportunity next Saturday after
noon to see and hear America's
foremost authority on international
law, Hon. John W. Foster, who
speaks in the chapel at 1:45. In
addition to that of Mr. Foster, we
are promised a visit next week
from President Hadley of Yale, one
of the most prominent economists
in the country. Plans were formu
lated this afternoon for the recep
tion of President McKinley when
he visits the University in May.
So far distant are we from the nation
al capital that we can seldom listen
to men who play a prominent part
in national and international affairs.
Every student should therefore take
advantage of the privilege to hear
these distinguished men.
