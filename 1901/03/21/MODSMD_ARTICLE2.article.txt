# To Welcome President McKinley.
## 
### 
Mayor Martin and Mr. Green
inger, director-general of theCarni
val of Roses, came up from San
Jose today to confer with the stu
dent committee regarding Stanford
co-operation in the reception to be
tendered by the Garden City to
President McKinley in May. Stu
dent efforts in this direction will
be hampered by the necessity of
greeting the President on our own
campus the day following his San
Jose appearance, but the commit
tee expressed their willingness to
assist in any possible way. Plans
are not definitely arranged,
but it is probable that Stan
ford will be represented in the
grand procession by a float and by
the University band. A Glee Club
concert or a Varsity baseball game
may contribute to the festivities.
