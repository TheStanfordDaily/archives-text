# Letters from a Boer Enthusiast.

### 
A surprising and regrettable feat
ure of the approaching Intercolleg
iate debate is the attitude assumed
by a former Boer official, now resid
ing in San Francisco, toward the
action of the Cardinal team in se
lecting the pro-Knglish side of the
South African question. The name
of the gentleman is Mr. Van Bag
gen, and, evidently laboring under
the delusion that a conspiracy is
on foot to prejudice the popular
mind against his country's cause,
he expressed himelf thus in a let
ter to President Jordan.
"... It is sad to believe that
there can be one young American
in one of our great American uni
versities so ignorant or so poisoned
in mind as to defend this resolu
tion; and yet when I have heard
with my own ears how President
Wheeler called the civilization
"squatter civilization" in these Re
publics, comparing the Boers with
the Indians, etc; when I recollect
how Prof. L. Dyer maliciously lied
about my people before the stu
dents; when I recollect how last
year Professor Ross of Stanford, in
the anti-Japanese mass-meeting,
stated that California was the home
of the Anglo-Saxon race—while he
was probably the only one belong
ing lo that race in the meeting
then it seems to me lhat there is a
conspiracy among theße Anglo-
Saxon agitator-professors to put
the Californian universities on
record as justifying England before
the public and the coming genera
tion. They will probably have
Stanford on the affirmative and
make it win . . . . Believe
me, the Boers will win and England
is doomed, despite the assistance of
this Government and the insults of
the people to their institutions of
government, which were more Dem
ocratic, more Republican, purer,
and in advance of this country."
After receiving Dr. Jordan's re
ply giving the requested informa
tion as to place of debate and ad

mission, Mr. Van Baggen wrote
again, the following being an ex
tract from the letter:
"As Prof. Dr. Wheeler states
that the knowledge of facts concern
ing conditions in South Africa is
not as complete as might be de
sired, Mr. Cecil M. Marrack will
have an easy opportunity to put
the Stanford University on record
as being in favor of the worst kind
of anarchy —the destruction of Re
publican governments,"
The writer further urges that
the President use his influence to
prevent the question from being
discussed.
Marrack has written Mr. Van
Baggen assuring him that personal
beliefs were not considered in
choosing the sides, and that Stan
ford men have chosen the affirma
tive simply because they believe
their best chances with the judges
lie in that direction.
