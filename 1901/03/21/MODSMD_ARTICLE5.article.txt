# Position for Stanford Graduate.

### 
This morning's papers announce
the appointment of Rennie Wilbur
Doane by Fish Commissioner A.
L. Little of Washington as super
intendent of the scientific experi
mental yynrk authorised by the
legislature of that State, and which
was provided for by an appropri
ationof $10,000.
Mr. Doane graduated from Stan
ford in 1890, his major being En
tomology. While in college he was
an active member of the Zoology
Club, and was one of the best stu
dents and collectors in his depart
ment. After his graduation he re
ceived an appointment as assistant
professor of natural science in the
Washington Agricultural College.
He subsequently worked himself
up until he had charge of the en
tomology and biology departments.
He has from time to time written
scientific articles on new species of
insects, and has thus become
known as an eminent entomolo
gist. For the last two summers
he has been investigating the oys
ters of Puget Sound, and it
was doubtless this and other
work in economic biology which
gained for him this recent appoint
ment. He has resigned from the
college faculty and will devote his
entire attention to his new work,
which will begin on April Ist.
