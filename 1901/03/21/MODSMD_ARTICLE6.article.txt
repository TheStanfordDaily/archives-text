# Stock Farm Exhibit.
## 
### 
Mr. Covey, foreman of the Stock
Farm, is preparing an exhibit of
Stock Farm relics, awards, and
prizes to be placed in the museum.
It will occupy that part of the
Natural History room where the
skeleton of Electioneer now stands.
The skeleton of Arion, paintings
of several of the horses which
have made the Palo Alto farm
famous the world over, the high
wheeler sulky in which was made
the world's record for yearlings by
Bellbird, 2:26Â£, for two-year-olds
by Arion, 2:10$, for stallions by
Palo Alto, 2:083, and the world's
championship record by Sunol,
2:08-}, together with the skeleton
of Electioneer, all are now at the
museum. A number of awards
and prizes taken by Vina and
Gridley stock in county and State
fairs will arrive soon. These, with
a like collection from the Palo

Alto farm, with what is already in
the museum, and with the many
records made by Palo Alto horses,
will form an interesting and
unique exhibit, pointing to Leland
Stanford's history as a successful
stock fancier.
