# Doings at the Stock Farm.
## 
### 
Ihe Stock Farm will be a busy
place from this time until the first
of May, when the band of horses
now under training will be shipped
to the annual Blue Ribbon Sale at
Cleveland, Ohio, to be put up at
auction. Forty-eight horses, two-,
three-, and four-year-olds, all of
good blood and in first-class shape,
will be sent. The main object at
present is to develop speed, and the
animals are being worked on the
Stock Farm track daily during
the hours from 2:30 to 6. On
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Sat'
urdays, when the horses will be
put through their best paces, the
exhibitions will be especially good.
This shipment will be one of the
best ever sent East from the Palo
Alto farm.
