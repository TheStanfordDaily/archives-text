### 
The annual field-day between
the Freshman Class team and the
athletes from the Oakland High
School will take place on the
campus tomorrow morning at
10:30. The events will probably
be among the most hard fought of
the season. The Oakland High
School team will contain such men
as Westdahl, La Valliere, and
Lundy. while the Freshmen will
put up several men who have al
ready won honors, and many more
who will doubtless make the Var
sity this spring. All the men who
will enter the different events have
trained consistently for some time,
the Freshmen having had a squad
of twenty-five men out on the
track for nearly two months.
The events and the entries for
them by the Freshmen will be, as
nearly as can be ascertained, as
follows: 50 yard dash —Bubb,
Lamb; 100 yard dash —Hamilton,

440; Westdahl for the 880; Clough
and Westdahl for the mile run;
and Miranda for the pole-vault.
