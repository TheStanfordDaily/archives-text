We have been urged by parties
whose sense of decency has been
grossly violated to exert our influ
ence against the shocking misuse
by an unmentionable fraternity—
and a few others —of the opportun
ities offered by the proximity of
Lagunita to the campus. The au
thorities, driven to plain words in
self-defense, have issued an edict
which declares that unless the cos
tume prescribed by etiquette be
donned by would-be bathers, all
use of the lake's waters except by
boats and mud-hens will be pro
hibited. Native delicacy has hith
erto prevented us from speaking
our mind on this momentous ques
tion, but now that official sanction
has been granted, we feel free to
say that if these heinous practices
be not discontinued, it will be
come our painful pleasure to ferret
out the offenders and exert the
power of the press to uphold them
to popular scorn from Alta Vista
to San Jose.
