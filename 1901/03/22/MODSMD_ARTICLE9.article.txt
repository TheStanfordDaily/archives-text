# OUTER QUADRANGLE.
## Where the Various Departments Will Be Placed When the New Buildings Are Finished. 
### 
The new buildings of the outer
quadrangle are going up slowly,
but steadily. The Chapel and
the buildings to the west of the
Memorial Arch, as well as the
corner building next the Library
will probably be completed by the
first of January, 1902. The new
Chemistry building, together with
the Assay laboratory directly be
hind it, situated near the Museum,
will be finished by next Septem
ber, or the opening of the next
college year. The friese about the
Arch is progressing very slowly be
cause of the difficulty and nicety
of the work, but the contractors
hope to have it done by a year
from next June. Only the outline
of most of the figures on the arch,
as well as only the skeleton work
of most of the buildings, have as
yet been finished.
As for the uses to which the
different buildings of the outer
quad are to be put, assuming the
arch to face north, the northwest
corner building will be devoted to
the Department of Physics, and
the northeast corner to the Eco
nomics, History, and English de
partments. The buildings between
the Physics building and the Arch,
corresponding to the positions of
the Library and Assembly Hall,
will be occupied by the Depart
ments of Natural Science: Physi
ology, Entomology, Zoology, Bot
any, and Geology. An exhibit
room, corresponding in size and
position to the Library, will be
placed in this building.
These are the only departments
whose positions in the outer quad
are definitely determined upon, but
Psychology will probably occupy
the buildings behind the Physics,
and Engineering on the other side
of the quad behind the Economics,
History, and English building.
The Law department and Law
school will permanently occupy
the inner quadrangle, and the De
partments of Mathematics, Phil
osophy, and Languages will stay
where they are now, at least for
the present.
