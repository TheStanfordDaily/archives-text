# UNITED STATES CONSULS.
## Hon. J.W. Foster Enlightens Students About Our Agents in Foreign Countries. 
### 
The Hon. John Watson Foster,
Secretary of State under Harrison
and for many years active as min
ister to foreign countries or sta
tioned at various consular posts,
addressed a large Stanford audi
ence in the chapel Saturday after
noon. His subject was "The Con
sular Service of the United States."
Within the course of a little more
than an hour Mr. Foster outlined
briefly but clearly the historic de
velopment of the international con
sular service, giving special atten
tion to the American system. A
resume of his speech follows:
"The consular system arose out
of differences in religion and com
merce; it received its first great im
pulse for growth during the time of
the Crusades. The consul's powers
were originally judicial, but these
were restricted as his commercial
functions enlarged. The United
States when they became a nation
accepted the system at its stage of
development, which had reached an
international existence. Washing
ton before 1792 elected fifteen min
isters; Congress has been slow to
take measures, and left the consu
lar service in charge of the Depart
ment of State until 1856. Up to
that time the consuls were 'paid
only in fees.'
"The principal grades in the ser
vice are consuls-general, consuls,
commercial agents, vice and dep
uty consuls general, vice and
deputy consuls, and consular clerks.
Consuls-general and consuls are
appointed by the president and
confirmed by the Senate, consular
agents are nominated by consuls,
clerks are appointed by the Presi
dent and are limited in number to
thirteen. Merchant or commer
cial consuls receive a salary not
exceeding one thousand dollars per
annum. When a consul-general,
consul, or commercial agent is ap
pointed he must furnish bond equal
to his salary; this is due to the
sums of money that pass through
his hands.
"It, is the policy of the govern
ment not to appoint foreign citi
zens to consular posts nor natural
ized citizens to the country of
their nativity. Upon his arrival
at a port, a consul must report his
arrival to the minister of his coun
try there resident. His official
recognition depends upon an exe
quatur, a written instrument which
in the United States must be
signed by the President, in some
countries by the minister merely.
The United States seldom refuses
an exequatur; European nations do
sometimes. Withdrawal of exe
quatur operates as a dismissal of
the consul.
"A United States consul must
reside in the district to which he is
appointed. His duties are of u
commercial, not of a diplomatic
character, —but where he has pow
ers of a diplomatic nature he be
comes a charge <V affaires. Con
suls at ports must give certification
of all invoices of goods to be im
norted. of all merchandise for free
entrance, and concerning the re
turn of marketable goods. They
must certify as to genuineness of
trade-marks, grant landing certifi
cates, and seal cars and cargoes
which pass on the bonded system.
His duties in relation to American
merchant vessels are numerous.
He not only regulates the sailing
of vessels, but the cargoes of all
vessels hound for the United States.
He supplies captains with charts
issued by the navigation depart
ment, and adjusts all difficulties of
or between captain and crew.
"To American citizens in general
he is of importance. He must de
termine who are citizens, issue
passports, and secure general pro
tection. Though he has no author
ity to get an American citizen out
of jail or difficulty, his request is
usually granted as a mark of
courtesy. He keeps a register of
all American citizens residing per
manently in his district, may offi
ciate at marriages, and though it
is not his legal duty he is expected
to take a lead in matters attending
the burial of deceased citizens, and
must take legal charge of their ef
fects.
"Resides attending matters on
immigration and quarantine regu
lations, he makes monthly and an
nual reports on the condition of
foreign trade, facility for commu
nication, decline or development
of manufacturing centers, changes
in the economic conditions of com
munities —urban and rural —
changes in tariff and shipping reg
ulations, changes in legislation af
fecting industry and trade, on pub
lic and private undertakings in
which United States citizens may
he interested, and special reports
<xn the prices current of all pro
ducts and manufactured articles
likely to be exported to the United
States, and must report on the rates
of exchange. Consuls in most Ori
ental countries exercise certain
judicial authority on the principle
of extra-territoriality, whereby a
foreigner in an eastern country is
subject to the laws of his native
country.
"A consul is not entitled to the
immunities of ministers; but by
exemptions conceded by interna
tional treaties he is free from mili
tary service, arrest, or taxation
except on private business enter
prise.
"The consular service is the sub
ject of much criticism, and Congress
has been urged to legislate pre
paratory to reform. The best plan
would be to hold the service open
upon the competitive examination
system. The service of consulate
demands special preparation con
sisting of a general knowledge of
law and commercial affairs, still
there is no encouragement for
young men to take this special
preparation. Unless he has a
"pull" with his senator or congress
man he is not likely to secure ap
pointment, and the young men
who have devoted themselves to
study usually do not have the
"pull." As a rule, it is a respect
able service, but if reform in poli
tics is needed anywhere it is in o 1 r
relation with foreign affairs."
