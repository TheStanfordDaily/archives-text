# UNITED STATES CONSULS.
## Hon. J.W. Foster Enlightens Students About Our Agents in Foreign Countries. 
### 
The Hon. John Watson Foster,
Secretary of State under Harrison
and for many years active as min
ister to foreign countries or sta
tioned at various consular posts,
addressed a large Stanford audi
ence in the chapel Saturday after
noon. His subject was "The Con
sular Service of the United States."
Within the course of a little more
than an hour Mr. Foster outlined
briefly but clearly the historic de
velopment of the international con
sular service, giving special atten
tion to the American system. A
resume of his speech follows:
"The consular system arose out
of differences in religion and com
merce; it received its first great im
pulse for growth during the time of
the Crusades. The consul's powers
were originally judicial, but these
were restricted as his commercial
functions enlarged. The United
States when they became a nation
accepted the system at its stage of
development, which had reached an
international existence. Washing
ton before 1792 elected fifteen min
isters; Congress has been slow to
take measures, and left the consu
lar service in charge of the Depart
ment of State until 1856. Up to
that time the consuls were 'paid
only in fees.'
"The principal grades in the ser
vice are consuls-general, consuls,
commercial agents, vice and dep
uty consuls general, vice and
deputy consuls, and consular clerks.
Consuls-general and consuls are
appointed by the president and
confirmed by the Senate, consular
agents are nominated by consuls,
clerks are appointed by the Presi
dent and are limited in number to
thirteen. Merchant or commer
cial consuls receive a salary not
exceeding one thousand dollars per
annum. When a consul-general,
consul, or commercial agent is ap
pointed he must furnish bond equal
to his salary; this is due to the
sums of money that pass through
his hands.
"It, is the policy of the govern
ment not to appoint foreign citi
zens to consular posts nor natural
ized citizens to the country of
their nativity. Upon his arrival
at a port, a consul must report his
arrival to the minister of his coun
try there resident. His official
recognition depends upon an exe
quatur, a written instrument which
in the United States must be
signed by the President, in some
countries by the minister merely.
The United States seldom refuses
an exequatur; European nations do
sometimes. Withdrawal of exe
quatur operates as a dismissal of
the consul.
"A United States consul must
reside in the district to which he is
appointed. His duties are of u
commercial, not of a diplomatic
character, â€”but where he has pow
ers of a diplomatic nature he be
comes a charge <V affaires. Con
suls at ports must give certification

norted. of all merchandise for free
