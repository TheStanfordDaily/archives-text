# STANFORD 6, ALUMNI 2.
## Cardinal Defeats Old Timers in a Well-Played Game of Baseball. 
### 
Although the day was far from
being ideal for baseball, the Var
sity and Alumni gave a very good
and interesting exhibition of our
national pastime on the oval Sat
urday. The Alumni were some
what handicapped by lack of prac
tice, but with one or two exceptions
they put up a steady game. Kaars
burg pitched his usually good ball,
and the Varsity found it hard to
place the sphere in safe ground.
Goslinsky on first base and Morse
and Phelan in the outfield were
also grandstand performers for the
Alumni.
Bennett, the Varsity pitcher, de
serves much of the credit for win
ning the game. He had plenty of
speed, perfect control, and
was never once found want
ing at a critical moment. He
lasted the nine innings and his
arm never weakened. The Varsity
was in good form both in batting
and fielding, except that the men
who have been recently changed
about had not as yet become ac
customed to their new positions
and were almost entirely responsi
ble for the sum in our error col
umn.
Ball caught in line form and his
throwing to bases showed consid
erable improvement. He also
handled the stick with good effect,
getting two pretty base hits, one of
which flew over the fence. Traeger
011 first is making good progress
and his hitting continues strong.
The game was a pitchers' battle
from start to finish, in which Ben
nett gained a decided advantage
over Kaarsburg. He permitted
only eight scattered hits, fanned
six men, and gave one man a base
on balls, while Kaarsburg allowed
nine safe hits, struck out two men,
and walked two.
The detailed score was as follows:
