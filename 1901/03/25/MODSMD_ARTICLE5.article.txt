having won from Gage 6-3, 6-0;
Adams lost to Weihe by default.
This left Baker and Weihe to con
test in the finals; Weihe won 6-4,
6-2.
The matches between Misnerand
Baker, Adams and Lieb, and Weihe
and Baker were all hotly contested.
The final match between Weihe
and Baker was especially interest
ing, as both men played hard and
in excellent form.
Berkeley's double players will
probably be McGavin and Selby.
The doubles tournament for Stan
ford to be held after the spring va
cation will probably be much closer
than the singles have been.
