We wish to congratulate the
Freshman track team upon the
creditable showing made in the
field-day with the Oakland High
School. The team that represented
Oakland was no mean aggregate of
athletes, and the honor in having
defeated it is far from being small.
This meet shows that among the
members of the Freshman Class
are many able men of Varsity
caliber who will greatly strengthen
the track team. All the men who
have trained so consistently for
this class affair should begin to
train even more conscientiously,
now that it has been won. The
field-day with California is not far
distant, and a great deal more than
usual is expected from the Fresh
men in this intercollegiate event.
They more than fulfilled these ex
pectations Saturday, and it is pos
sible for them by a course of hard
training to help make this year's
track meet with Berkeley a de
cided victory for Stanford.
