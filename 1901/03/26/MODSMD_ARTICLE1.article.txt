# YALE'S PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS
## Arthur Twining Hadley Urges Need of Good Fellowship Among American Universities. 
### 
Arthur Twining Hadley, presi
dent of Yale University, visited
Stanford this afternoon as the
guest of Dr. Jordan, and addressed
the students in Assembly Hall on
"The University Trust." The en
tire student body turned out to
hear the distinguished visitor, who
spoke briefly but to the point. At
the close an informal reception was
tendered President Hadley by the
faculty and their wives. Extracts
from the address follow:
"I count it a great pleasure to
meet an audience in so delightful
and informal ii manner as this.
I have known, as every one has
known, of Stanford University, of
its buildings, its laboratories, and
its surroundings, but 1 confess that
the realization far exceeds my ex
pectations.
"There are many ideas of what
a university consists; some con
sider it merely a medium for scat
tering know'edge abroad, a place
where men are trained in miscel
laneous facts. Another opposite
conception is that the university is
a place for the training of special
ists in law, medicine, and philos
ophy. But if we allow ourselves to
consider it as a place solely for the
production of doctors of philosophy,
we make a mistake, for four-fifths
of those who come to a university
come for the purpose of becoming
strong and broad-minded citizens,
and not with any special object in
view.
"The public believes in what it
can see, and thus overvalues the
work of the technical expert; the
tendency of the university is to
cater to this taste and to turn out,
not ten doctors of philosophy of
the first rank, but rather fifty
doctors of the second rank.
How are we to correct this ten
dency? I believe it is by a divi
sion of labor in education.
"We educators must, to use an
unpopular term, form an educa
tional trust. We must broaden
our investigations and develop our
graduate students. At some uni
versities there is a theory that in
order to have a teacher stimulated
on any line, the best work in that
line must be done within five hun
dred yards of where he is teaching.
This is a narrow policy, which is
rapidly losing ground. There is
no reason why the best work done
at one university should not be a
source of inspiration to all other
universities. We should be proud
rather than fearful of our rivals.
"Five years ago different colleges
had their alumni associations
whose meetings were filled with
slightly veiled expressions of hos
tility towards rival institutions
standing nearest to them. Now
the American Collegiate Alumni
recognize and appreciate the help
of one university to another.
"There was a time when Ameri
can college athletics had too much
the character of a succession of
fights; contests in which no obliga
tions were recognized except those
imposed by the rules, no authority
save that of the umpire. Such a

system struck at the foundation of
American manhood in a most in
sidious manner. It is this kind of
training in sharp practice which
leads a man to buy votes and to
spread false market reports. A
new regime has arisen under
which, in athletic affairs, students
of rival colleges treat each other
as gentlemen, preferring rather
honorable defeat .than dishonorable
victory.
"Finally, let us understand that
in the work of our colleges the
greatest duty of the student is not
to get the most he can out of his
university, but to put what he can
into it. Let us understand that
each college is but a part of this
world of education, and he who
emphasizes his own university to
the exclusion of others fall short of
that broad mid liberal mindedness
which should characterize the true
educator."
