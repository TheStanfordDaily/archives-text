# "DRIVEN BACK TO EGYPT."
## Rehearsals of the Junior Farce Promise an Entertainment Unique in Stanford Theatricals. 
### 
Next Thursday evening the Jun
ior Class will present the prize
farce written by Larrey Bowman
and Bristow Adams, "Driven Back
to Egypt, or the Riddle of the
Sphinx."
The plot of this play, while in
timately connected with the Uni
versity, having its scenes laid in
the Museum, at a professor's home,
and on the quad, is still of such
broad and general interest that it
could be enjoyed at any place.
Mainly the complications center
around the following events: Harry
Allen, a jolly Junior, gets into a
scrape by painting the Sphinxes
at the gate a Nile green, in which
he is discovered by an uncle whom
he has never met. The uncle, if
pleased with him on a visit to the
college, will give Harry a generous
allowance and place in his will.
To escape from the uncle before
being recognized Harry decides to
leave college, but finds he cannot
make the proper connections, so he
decides to impersonate a mummy
who is to be brought back to life
by Professor Palmer, a Stanford
servant. Amidst some hair-raising
tableaux Allen is resuscitated as
Rameses of Egypt.
Most of the humorous situations
in the play come from the imper
sonation of Rameses by the stu
dent, who knows as much about
Egyptology as a cat does. He
makes love to the professor's
daughter, which comes natural to
him, but finally he comes to the
point where he can no longer keep
up the pace. He decides to die as
Ramesee. The cause of death and
manner of dying is the most re
markable ever presented on any
stage.
In the third act Allen, alias
Rameses, comes back to life. He
discovers that his uncle never saw
him, and wins his sweetheart, Miss
Palmer, in spite of the perfidy of
his chum. Everything ends satis
factorily, and Professor Palmer's
grief is only assuaged by the idea
that he can resuscitate another
mummy, and thus gain the wis
dom of Egypt in spite of Rameses'
death.
The characters are all well taken,
and several new figures will appear
before the footlights of the Univer
sity. Tomorrow's paper will con
tain further details, together with
a complete cast of characters.
