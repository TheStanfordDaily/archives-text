# "A Man's Religion."
## 
### 
Professor Howard based his ser
mon in the chapel Sunday on the
experiences of Micah, and found the
keynote to true religion in the
sixth chapter, eighth verse: "What
doth the Lord require of thee, but
to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy
God?"
"This young man," meaning
Micah, "had evidently formed the
rather dangerous habit of doing
his own thinking. He was only a
minor prophet, but he had gotten
hold of a major truth, and was
brave enough to tell it to his age.
For who are the prophets of earth

but the men whose minds and
spirits are awake, who can see a di
vine truth, men who spell God's
thoughts out of the commonplace
experiences of ijfe? They find
their prophecies in no strange way;
truth throbs its message to them
in the heart-beat of human life.
"Back of all the mere seeming
and the appearance of religion he
sought the reality of it. He dared
to strip away the husks of cere
mony and creed and assert the
worth of character above creed, the
value of righteous manhood above
religious manners.
"The same great truth runs
through the words of both these
preachers" (Micah and Isaiah).
"They both locate the root of true
religion in the kind of life a man
lives. The forms of opinions and
of ritual are of no moment com
pared with the development of
manhood.
"Micah 3ets man squarely in
front of a life. He does not pro
pose a set of formulated opinions
and say, 'Believe this,' but lie sets
up a type of character, a standard
of conduct, and says, 'Live that.'
"Man is asked to be something.
He makes of religion something
fibrous and real; declares that to
be religious is nothing other than
to be the highest type of man, that
religion was no mere adjunct of
life, it was life itself, a resolute fac
ing of the day's work.
"When man is meeting, so far as
he understands them, the demands
of social ethics, and when he is
true to the visions that his moral
and spiritual perceptions bring
him, that man is truly religious.
The truest and most rational defi
nition of religion is this: A type
of character and a standard of con
duct that make a man count for
most in himself as a man and in
his relations as a member of soci
ety. Thisincludes all. It requires
a man to be straight in his deal
ings, and sets him at work fulfil
ling his social claims. It means
that God expects a man to have
high ideals of life for himself and
for the world about him."
