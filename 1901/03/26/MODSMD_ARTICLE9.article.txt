Senior Class assessments must
be paid immediately so that the
Finance Committee will know how
much money to count on for Com
mencement Week. The amount
levied is very small, being only
one-half the usual size, and every
one is able to pay it. The class
has quite a sum in the bank now,
and if all the assessments are paid
will be in a condition to have the
finest graduating exercises in the
history of the University. It has
been proposed to leave whatever
money remains after the expenses
are paid to the Training-house
Corporation to be used in fitting
up some part of the athletic field
as a memorial to the class. Nine
ty-nine started this custom, and
classes that come after nineteen
hundred and one will probably
follow it. It remains for the mem
bers of the present graduating class
to decide whether they are going
to pay their assessments and imi
tate ninety-nine's example of leav
ing something to their University
or nineteen hundred's of leaving
nothing.
