# ON CINDER PATH.
## Entries for Friday's Inter-Class Field-Day.â€”Complete List of Track Men. 
### 
The track men are fast rounding
into shape and the field-day Fri
day will see some good perform
ances. The sprints will be the
most closely contested events of the
day. McCaughern, Stewart, and
Harter of last year's team will com
pete, and each one should run in
fast time. The other three con
testants will be Bubb, Lamb, and
Hamilton, the fast Freshman trio.
Every one of these men has a good
chance for first place in either race,
so that close finishes are assured.
In the hurdles, Naramore should
secure first place, but he will be
hard pressed in the high sticks by
Taylor and Mills. In the low hurdles
Dunn, Fay, and Beebe will make
the running close. Kuhn should
give a good account of himself in
both these events.
Smith, Hawley, Birtch, Holman,
Knight, Slaker, and Prentice will
run in the quarter. Smith should
win, with the chances evenly di
vided among the others for places.
The half and the mile will be
(taken by Chadbourne and Hamil
ton, with Sprague probably third
in the mile. Talbot, Hawley, and
Ellen wood are strong candidates
for a place in the half.
The walk will go to Zschokke,
with Lousley and Lewis in the
places.
Henley will probably win the
two jumps, but will be hard pressed
in the pole-vault by Dole, Beach,
and Foster. The broad jump will
bring out Preston, Symonds, Lyons,
and Naramore, while in the high
jump Dole, Preston, and Beach
will compete.
Brooke will win the hammer
throw, while the places will lie be
tween Traeger, Nichols, Hyde, and
McFadden.
Traeger should win the shot-put,
but Hyde, Brooke, and Clarke will
make the competition close.
