Treatises on punctuality ap
pear in almost every book to in
culcate good principles into the
young, and it is to be regretted
that such a subject should need to
be brought before a university pub
lic. But conditions require it. To
our knowledge no public exercises
have been held at Stanford this
year but have been interrupted by
the late entrance of from one to
forty people. Chapel services are
invariably disturbed, speakers like
Secretary Foster and President
Hadley have had their sentences
punctuated by slamming of doors
and tramp of the footsteps of those
whose time is evidently more valu
able than that of the speaker. Our
students are not the only offenders,
as members of the faculty ranks
will testify. Such practices are
more than mere annoyance; every
tardy entrance is a personal insult
to the man who is giving his best
to the University. Rules are out
of the question, but if a public sen
timent could be created against
so pernicious a custom, wonderful
results would accrue.
