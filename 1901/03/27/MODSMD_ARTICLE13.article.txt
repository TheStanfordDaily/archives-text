The figures in fielding do not
tell the whole story. A shortstop
with an average of .800 is consid
ered higher than an outfielder av
erage of 1.000. The same holds
true of third base.
In base running the record is as
follows: Murphy 10, Traeger 7,
Edwards 7, Symonds 6, Cowden 5,
Misner 5, Ball 1, and Brown 1.
