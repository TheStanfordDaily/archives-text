The farce contains a consecutive
plot with logically woven sub-plots
that help and do not hinder the

action. There is little or no de
pendence on "stunts" or songs to

terest.
In regard to treatment of various
elements in college life, particular
pains have heen taken to keep
from offending any persons, though
this has not resulted in making a.
colorless producth n. The faculty
suffers a little, hut there is alto
gether lacking reference to persons
or events that would not he strictly
in good taste.
