With only one week remaining
before the first game of the Inter
collegiate series, it is lamentable
that the interest of the student
body in our baseball team is far
from what it should be. Our hopes
for victory this season are by no
means dim. It is true that the
path of those upon whom rests the
burden of developing a team has
not been a smooth one, but thanks
to the unceasing efforts of coach
and captain, we have brought out
a team which will give a good ac
count of itself. Our hopes do not
rest upon one or two stars, but up
on the hardest playing of which
the team individually and collec
tively is capable. The baseball
men this season have worked hard
and conscientiously under disad
vantageous circumstances to bring
us victory, and whether they suc
ceed or not, it is the duty of every
member of the student body to
give them his encouragement and
support in recognition of their la
bors.
