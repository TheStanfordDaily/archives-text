# Track Team at Buffalo.
## 
### 
The colleges of the Middle West
are getting together a track team
to send to the Pan-Hellenic
games at Buffalo next summer.
Manager Brightman of the Univer
sity of Washington has written
Manager Oilman, urging the col
leges of the Pacific Slope to send a
team. Negotiations are in order,
and it is possible that Stanford
may contribute four or five men
(with the Universities of Washing
ton, Oregon, and California) to a
team that would give a good idea
of what track athletics are on this
Coast. All the large colleges of
the East will compete.
