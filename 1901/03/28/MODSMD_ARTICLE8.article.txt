# DEBATE POSTPONED.
## Contest With Nebraska Will Not Take Place This Semester.â€”Word Received Today. 
### 
The Nebraska debate will not
take place this semester. "M. F.
McCormick of tbe Intercollegiate
Debating Committee received a let
ter this morning announcing that
it is found to be impracticable to
hold the contest at Lincoln this
spring and suggesting a postpone
ment until next semester. The
Inter-Society Debating Committee
this afternoon voted to accept the
suggestion, leaving the time to be
fixed by negotiation next fall. The
following extracts from the letter,
which closes with an expression of
regret, set forth the reasons which
caused Nebraska to ask for the
change:
"After three hours' deliberation
last night, the debating associa
tion voted to postpone the debate
from May to next December. This
was done with regret. Owing to a
number of difficulties that we had
not foreseen early enough, it was
impossible to have this debate be
fore the first week in May at the
earliest. Then we found ourselves
in an inextricable position with
Missouri, with whom we have a
written agreement for a debate the
first week of May. That date can
not be changed. We thought then
of bringing you here late in May,
but that is precluded by your ina
bility to come at that time, and
also by the fact that we can not se
cure the Oliver theater during that
month. Moreover, it looked as if
we would have to send our second
rate men against Leland Stanford,
because our best men were al
ready assigned to other States,
or else were so crowded with work
that they were unavailable. You
see, Nebraska debates with Colo
rado, Missouri, and Kansas. This
takes away nine of our best men.
The association looks with disfavor
on the idea of putting up second
rate men for so important a de
bate."
The letter says that the students
are anxious for tbe contest, and
offers a further suggestion that the
question and preliminary matters
be arranged this spring. The De
bating Committee, however, de
cided that all arrangements, so far
as Stanford is concerned, should
be delayed until next fall. This
turn of affairs is a serious disap
pointment to Stanford, as our team
is already selected to debate in
May.
At the meeting the Inter-Society
Committee voted to admit as mem
bers delegates from tlie "Collegi
ate" Society of San Jose, composed
of Stanford students. C. D. Mc-
Comish, '03, was elected a member
of the Intercollegiate Debating
Committee iti place of Frank
Adams, who is absent from the
University.
