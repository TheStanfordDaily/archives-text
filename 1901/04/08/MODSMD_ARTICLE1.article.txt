# U.C. 9, STANFORD 6.
## Berkeley Wins the First Game of the Series in an Exciting but Erratic Contest. 
### 
Costly and inexcusable errors in
fielding turned what should have
been a Cardinal victory into defeat,
and gave our rivals the first game
of the Intercollegiate series by a
score of nine to six. Both teams
were somewhat afflicted with stage
fright, but Stanford, with fewer
Varsity veterans in her ranks and
with the bleachers against her, suf
fered much more than Berkeley.
The game was full of errors, but
many brilliant plays were made by
both teams.
The Stanford fielders spent the
first inning wearing off their ner
vousness, while Parker was mean
while endeavoring to swing his arm
in time with the Berkeley band, so
that when the first round was over
California had three runs to the
good. Stanford led by two runs in
the first half of the fifth, but er
ratic playing permitted Berkeley to
tie the score in their share of the
inning. After the fifth, California
scored three times, while Stanford
was unable to send a man home.
The plays which resulted in
scores were as follows: Hunter,
the first Berkeley batter, went to
first on Edward's fumble and stole
second. Smith was fielded out. on
first base by Edwards, and Hunter
scored on Bra ley's hit. Braley
stole second and came home on
Kennedy's two-bagger. Hamlin
flew out and Gardner hit, scoring
Kennedy. Krug followed with a
hit. but he and Gardner were left
on the bags by McKeown's out.
Score, 3 to 0.
In the second stage of the argu
ment, Ball was given free passage
to first, went to second on a passed
ball, and tallied on King's error in
handling Misner's drive to second
base. Misner stole second and
scored on Braley's error. Lowen
thal walked, went to second on
Barker's hit to third, but was
caught sleeping off second base and
thrown out, thereby retiring the
side. In Berkeley's half of the
second, Overall bit a long fly to
left-field and landed on first base
on Lowenthal's muff. He went to
second on a wild pitch and scored
on Hunter's two-bagger. After
this, neither side scored until the
fifth inning.
Brown opened the fifth inning
with a pretty base-hit, and after
stealing second, scored on Murphy's
safety. Murphy landed on third
before the ball stopped rolling, and
scored on Smith's error at the
plate. Edwards scored on Cow
den's hit. Ball went to first on
Overall's error, and Cowden moved
a notch on the same play. Misner
went to first on a balk, and Cow
den tallied. With Ball on third
and Misner on first, Lowenthal let
the third strike sail by and Stan
ford's scoring was over.
In the second half of the fifth,
Overall hit a long fly to
field. Symonds got his hands on
it, but was unable to squeeze it.
Overall and McKeown tallied on
Hunter's two-bagger. Score, 6 to 6.
Berkeley earned a run in the sixth,
and two errors by Murphy in the

eighth resulted in two more rune,
making the final score 9 to 6 in
Berkeley's favor.
The Stanford team was lament
ably weak in batting, only getting
six safeties. Parker at times
pitched good ball, but the Berke
ley rooters and players made him
a little nervous and he was afraid
to let out his speed Overall was
steady, only showing weakness in
the fifth, when he permitted Stan
ford to tally four runs. Both
pitchers were given extremely
ragged support.
The best work for Stanford was
done by Ball. He was always
cool and collected and was of great
help to Parker. Ball caught a per
fect game and made some of the
prettiest plays of the day. Brown
played fast ball, hitting twice out
of three times at bat, and backing
up throws in neat style. Misner
accepted six chances without an
error. Cowden fielded well and
used his stick to advantage.
Hunter, Gardner, and Overall
were the best performers for Berke
ley.
A hard catch by Edwards, and a
play executed by Ball and Misner
with a man on first and third, in
which the man attempting to come
home on Ball's throw to second
was flagged at the plate, were re
deeming features of a loose game.

pitchers were given extremely
ragged support.
The best work for Stanford was
done by Ball. He was always
cool and collected and was of great
help to Parker. Ball caught a per
fect game and made some of the
prettiest plays of the day. Brown
played fast ball, hitting twice out
of three times at bat, and backing
up throws in neat style. Misner
accepted six chances without an
error. Cowden fielded well and
used his stick to advantage.
Hunter, Gardner, and Overall
were the best performers for Berke
ley.
A hard catch by Edwards, and a
play executed by Ball and Misner
with a man on first and third, in
which the man attempting to come
home on Ball's throw to second
was flagged at the plate, were re
deeming features of a loose game.

Costly and inexcusable errors in
fielding turned what should have
been a Cardinal victory into defeat,
and gave our rivals the first game
of the Intercollegiate series by a
score of nine to six. Both teams
were somewhat afflicted with stage
fright, but Stanford, with fewer
Varsity veterans in her ranks and
with the bleachers against her, suf
fered much more than Berkeley.
The game was full of errors, but
many brilliant plays were made by
both teams.
The Stanford fielders spent the
first inning wearing off their ner
vousness, while Parker was mean
while endeavoring to swing his arm
in time with the Berkeley band, so
that when the first round was over
California had three runs to the
good. Stanford led by two runs in
the first half of the fifth, but er
ratic playing permitted Berkeley to
tie the score in their share of the
inning. After the fifth, California
scored three times, while Stanford
was unable to send a man home.
The plays which resulted in
scores were as follows: Hunter,
the first Berkeley batter, went to
first on Edward's fumble and stole
second. Smith was fielded out. on
first base by Edwards, and Hunter
scored on Bra ley's hit. Braley
stole second and came home on
Kennedy's two-bagger. Hamlin
flew out and Gardner hit, scoring
Kennedy. Krug followed with a
hit. but he and Gardner were left
on the bags by McKeown's out.
Score, 3 to 0.
In the second stage of the argu
ment, Ball was given free passage
to first, went to second on a passed
ball, and tallied on King's error in
handling Misner's drive to second
base. Misner stole second and
scored on Braley's error. Lowen
thal walked, went to second on
Barker's hit to third, but was
caught sleeping off second base and
thrown out, thereby retiring the
side. In Berkeley's half of the
second, Overall bit a long fly to
left-field and landed on first base
on Lowenthal's muff. He went to
second on a wild pitch and scored
on Hunter's two-bagger. After
this, neither side scored until the
fifth inning.
Brown opened the fifth inning
with a pretty base-hit, and after
stealing second, scored on Murphy's
safety. Murphy landed on third
before the ball stopped rolling, and
scored on Smith's error at the
plate. Edwards scored on Cow
den's hit. Ball went to first on
Overall's error, and Cowden moved
a notch on the same play. Misner
went to first on a balk, and Cow
den tallied. With Ball on third
and Misner on first, Lowenthal let
the third strike sail by and Stan
ford's scoring was over.
In the second half of the fifth,
Overall hit a long fly to
field. Symonds got his hands on
it, but was unable to squeeze it.
Overall and McKeown tallied on
Hunter's two-bagger. Score, 6 to 6.
Berkeley earned a run in the sixth,
and two errors by Murphy in the

eighth resulted in two more rune,
making the final score 9 to 6 in
Berkeley's favor.
The Stanford team was lament
ably weak in batting, only getting
six safeties. Parker at times
pitched good ball, but the Berke
ley rooters and players made him
a little nervous and he was afraid
to let out his speed Overall was
steady, only showing weakness in
the fifth, when he permitted Stan
ford to tally four runs. Both
pitchers were given extremely
ragged support.
