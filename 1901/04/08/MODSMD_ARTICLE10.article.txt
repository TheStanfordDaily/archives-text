It seems a pity that circum
stances should compel us to don
sword and helmet so soon after the
blessed Easter time, hut conditions
make it imperative that someone
should call attention to certain
facts regarding the observance of
training rules by Stanford athletes.
Considerable space would be occu
pied if we cared to publish the
names of those men who, within
three weeks of the intercollegiate
field-day, are consistently and wil
fully breaking the regulations which
they have agreed to observe. It is
in one sense an ugly subject to deal
with, that of admonishing univer
sity men that of their own voilit-ion
they are lessening our chances of
winning the up-hill fight against
Berkeley. For the first time in four
years there is a fighting chance to
win—by Herculean efforts, to be
sure, but to win. Across the bay
the athletes are working as if theirs
instead of ours was to be the pos
sible honor of overcoming crushing
odds, while some of our men, eager
enough in their jerseys, are seem
ingly apathetic out of them. It is
needless to enter into a discussion
of the value of training rules.
Every athlete knows what it means
to his chances to keep his body in
condition. And further, at every
other college in the country that
pretends to maintain a track team,
especially at California, infringe
ment of the trainer's requirements
is met by summary expulsion from
the squad. We leave it to the cap
tain and trainer of our team if it is
not high time such a stringent sys
tem was adopted at Stanford?
