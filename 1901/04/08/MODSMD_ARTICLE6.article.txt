# "Saved by a Knocker."

### 
Preparations for the presentation
of "Saved by a Knocker," by Cecil
Marrack, have been going on dur
ing vacation, and the members of
the cast are ready for the first re
hearsal, which will take place in
the Assembly Hall tomorrow after
noon at 4 o'clock.
This farce, it will > be remem
bered, was the one which ran such
a close second in the Junior compe
tition. The final selection of that
committee was prompted only by
the desire to depart from the cus
tom of presenting a play which
dealt almost wholly with local con
ditions, and the same committee
was appointed to arrange for the
presentation of "Saved by a
Knocker," which will be, in all

probability, the cleverest local take
off ever presented at Stanford. The
exciting events of the past year
have been skillfully worked into
the plot in a good natured but tell
ing way.
The almost risque feature of
some of the situations may be
guessed from the fact that most of
the characters will be recognized
as old friends. Axton Flunk, Uni
versity Registrar who knows
Shakspere; J. Ezra, Habberdowl;
George Washington Walker, an
ambitious resident of College Ter
race; J. Fritz Irish, debater; J<Â»e
Knocking, Palo Alto editor;
Chappie, Squawler, and Adder
claus, as well as several prominent
members of the fair sex, all take
part. Everyone may share the
pleasurable anticipation of seeing
or hearing himself knocked and
Chappie will be there to do it.
The farce will be presented in
the Assembly Hall, April 19th, the
evening before the field-day and
Intercollegiate debate. As the pro
ceeds will be in part for the benefit
of the Associated Students it is
planned to have athletes and de
baters occupy reserved seats, and
make this the occasion of the an
nual rally.
