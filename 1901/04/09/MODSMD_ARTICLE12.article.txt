If the student body was har
assed by any doubts as to what
constitutes encouragement for a
baseball team, it should have gone
over en masse to witness last Sat
urday's game at Berkeley. How
ever partisan the spectator, he must
admit the presence of a mutual
feeling of confidence between the
bleachers and players of our rivals.
Occasional lessons can be learned
even from Berkeleyans, and if hon
orable victory at any cost be our
watchword for the next contest, it
behooves every student to get into
harness at once. Let the band turn
out in force, even if the members
haven't time to practice. It is not
harmony of tone we want, but har
mony of spirit. If there is a dearth
of yell leaders, they can easily be
appointed by the student body
president. If we can't cheer in
unison, let every man cheer for
himself —but cheer! Stanford's year
of victory has gone too far to be
blasted at this juncture. On our
own campus, with numerically
stronger support, we have even
chances of downing California. Let
players and students do their part,
and not one of these chances need
be lost.
