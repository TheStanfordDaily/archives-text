Students, professors, and others
interested in the welfare of the
Daily Palo Alto do not pay enough
attention to our advertisements.
The business men, who put them
in, do not do so from charitable
purposes. They expect to receive
enough additional trade to pay for
them. If they do not, they are un
willing to pay good rates, and the
manager in order to make both ends
meet is forced to fill the sheet with
poorly paid ads instead of being
able to run only a few well paid
ones. It shows a very unhealthy
condition of affairs when objection
able ads could appear in the I)aily
for nearly three months before the
faculty discovered that they were
not nice. One of the laundry agents
a few days ago boasted that his firm
received most <>112 the business here
and did not use the advertising
space of any University publica
tion. If our subscribers would pat
ronize only those who use our col
umns, business men would be able

to see things differently, and some
one might he found who would be
willing to assume the onerous duties
of business managership of the
Daily Palo Alto.
