## 
### 
Manager McCormick of the 1902
Quad lias been in the city' during
the past week making final ar
rangements for the publication of
the annual. Everything is now
in the hands of the printer except
the illustrations for the "joshes"
and they will he in this week. The
actors of the Junior Farce were
photographed and a full page will
he given to the scenes and actors
of the play. The book will contain
twenty-five pages more than last
year's Quad, hut will not be as
bulky, there being fewer advertise
ments, and glazed paper being
used instead of soft, heavy paper.
It will have several new features
and more illustrations than ever
before.
Owing to the large amount of
line engravings and half-tones, the
work has been delayed somewhat,
and the book will not be put on
sale during the first week in May.
No orders for copies will he taken
previous to publication, but as
usual, the edition will be limited.
