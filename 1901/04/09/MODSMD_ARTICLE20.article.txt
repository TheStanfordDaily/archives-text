Oakd of Thanks. â€”Those who
staged the Junior Farce wish par
ticularly to thank Encina Club
and individual men in Encina, also
the Kappa Alpha Theta and Phi
Delta Theta fraternities, for the
loan of properties used on the
stage. Much credit for the success
of the performance is due also to
George McDougald, ex-'o'2. who
was originally cast for the part of
"Harry Allen" and "liameses,"
hut who was prevented by sickness
from taking part at the last mo
ment. His presence and enthu
siasm at the time when rehearsals
were particularly trying did much
toward the linal presentation of the
farce. Thanks are due. too, to all
who aided the production in vari
ous ways, too varied to he men
tioned separately.
