# STUDENTS AS OIL EXPERTS.
## Stanford Geologists Create a Furor Scientific Terms Roughly Handled by Halfmoon Paper. 
### 
The Peninsula Pennant, a weekly
newspaper published at Halfmoon
Bay, presented its readers in the
last issue with an amusing and in
some respects amazing account of
recent visits to the (Joust of certain
Stanford expeditions. Typographi
es 1 errors have been carefully re
produced in the reprint published
below. The first article, which is
about the geologizing trip taken by
the classes in Paleontology ami
Petrography under the direction
of Dr. J. P. Smith during the mid
semester vacation, is as follows:
"A party of students of the Geol
ogy department of Stanford Uni
versity, accompanied by Professors
Smith, Arnold, and Roberts, are
making a study of the geological
formations of the coast region from
Point San Pedro to Pescadero.
''The structural geology is under
the direction of Mr. Arnold. Dr.
J. A. Smith has the paleontoligical
branch of the work and general su
pervision of the culinary depart
ment. His coffee and bouillon are
unexcelled. Mr. Arnold also knows
something about 'flap-jacks,' Pro
fessor Roberts, head of the trans
portation department and, inci
dentally the exterminatior of stray
canines, having accompanied the
party chiefly for recuperation from
the arduous duties connected with
the University, has done no active
work. Professor Arnold has studied
minutely the fossils of the Pliocene
and Miocene formations, his inten
tion being to write an exhaustive
monograph on the farmas, princi
pally of the pecterns, mactras, and
the smaller undescribed gastero
poda.
"Dr. H. W. Furlong of Berkeley,
accompanied the party and added
much merriment at the camp-fire
by his songs and good stories. His
explorations added greatly to the
further knowledge of the local
geology.
"The party found good trout fish
ing in the neighboring brooks, the
catch of one day amounting to 200
fish. Dr. Smith drew the prize in
fishing, having caught more than
half of this number.
"Aside from the pleasure attend
ant upon the trip much good work
was done by the party.
"The granite which makes up
Point Montara was followed for
many miles inland and the contact
with the sandstone accurately map
ped. From Pilar Point to Pesca
dero the formations composing the
bluffs were closely followed and
data collected with a view to later
laboratory work.
"The amount of information col
lected will take many months of
close work and study to classify
and to make ready for a complete
report."
The second account gives several
students, who posed as oil experts
and who probably never saw any
crude protroleum in their lives,
some cheap notoriety. It reads as
follows:
"A party of prominent students
from Stanford University visited

our town the (irst «»f the week. The
personnel of the party wan as fol
lows: li. H. Bacon, '02; L. O.
Moore and W. W. Copp, '08; Nor
man Col Iyer and Jfi. W. Curtis, '04.
J he gentlemen were somewhat reti
cent about the real object of their
visit, l>ut it. is understood that they
are investigating the geological
strata of the surrounding country
for indications of oil. A represent
ative of the Pennant visited Mr.
Col Iyer at his rooms in the Occi
dental Hotel Tuesday. 'We are on
a pleasure trip,' said Mr. Collyer,
'hut at the same time we are acting
in the interests of certain local cap
italists, who helieve that this re
gion has a heavy oil-hearing strata
that can he profitably operated. Of
course we cannot say as yet what
the prospects are for oil wells in the
vicinity of Halfmoon Hay, hut. we
believe them to he very favoraMe.
I was much pleased and somewhat
surprised at the prosperous a ppear
ance of your city, and I expect to
see within a few years, at most, a
great increase in the sale of real
estate, a renewed impetus to trade,
and probably the much needed ex
tension of the railroad to Halfmoon
Bay. No, I am not at liberty to
say more at present about the oil
syndicate.' "
