# MAY COME TO STANFORD.
## Professor McLaughlin of the University of Michigan Offered Professorship in History. 
### 
Professor Andrew C. McLaughlin,
head of the department of Ameri
can history at the University of
Michigan, is considering an offer
made him by this University
which, if accepted, will add a strong
man to the University's corps of
History instructors.
Professor McLaughlin is an au
thority of note in the held of Amer
ican constitutional and political
history, and is the author of the
life of Lewis Cass in the "Ameri
can Statesmen" series.
in answer to a recent question as
to his rumored intention of leaving
Michigan, Professor McLaughlin
said, as quoted in the University of
Michigan Daily: "Yes. I have
received a very liberal and tempt
ing offer from Leland Stanford. At
present I am quite unprepared to
make any statement as to my in
tentions â€”in fact, the matter can
not be decided in a moment, and is
accordingly, just at this time, up
in the air. I will say that 1 should
regret very much to leave Ann
Arbor, for I have been connected
either as a student or a professor
here for over twenty-three years."
