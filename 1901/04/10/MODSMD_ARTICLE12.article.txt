What has become of the Hooters'
Club which wan organized at the
end of the football season last fall?
It was made a permanent organiza
tion at that time, and we hoped
that it would do much toward
arousing enthusiasm in baseball
and track this semester. It is as
important for us to be victorious in
spring athletics as it is in football,
and nowhere does cheering count
for more than in baseball. The
game last Saturday gives a good
idea of what rooting and the sym
pathy of spectators will do. The
Berkeley team's work was as rag
ged as ours, but at critical moments
they knew what their sympathizers
expected and managed to turn what
seemed inevitable defeat into vic
tory. Next Saturday the second
game of the series takes place on
our campus. Our Rooters' Club
should have held several meetings
on the bleachers during baseball
practice this season. If this had
been done, it would have been pre
pared to give plenty of organized
cheering at Saturday's game. We
hope that the officers of the club
will get the members together and
prepare for the intercollegiate con
tests which occur later.
