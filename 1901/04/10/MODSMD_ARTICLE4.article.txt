# Seton Thompson to Lecture.
## 
### 
Ernest Seton Thompson, the
well-known author of "Wild Ani

main J Have Known," and various
magazine articles about animals,
will deliver a lecture in the As
sembly Hall on Tuesday evening,
April 28d. He has lectured with
considerable success in the East
and has had large audiences every
where.
The same committee of ladies
and gentlemen, most of them mem
bers of the faculty, that brought
the Henschells to the University,
have undertaken the responsibility
of rather a large guarantee to Mr.
Seton Thompson. This experi
ment of bringing a few of the best
musicians and lecturers to the Uni
versity during the col lege year de
pends upon the interest and co
operation of the entire c nnnmiity,
and it is hoped that the committee
will receive sufficient support to
warrant the experiment. The
tickets for the lecture will be sold
at popular prices. '1 lie author of
"Wild Animals'' will also give an
illustrated matinee for children at
the Methodist Church in Palo Alto
on the afternoon of the 28d.
