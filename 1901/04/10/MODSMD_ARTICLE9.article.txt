# TRACK WORK.
## The
						Try-Out Tomorrow Will Do Much to Determine Who Shall Form the Varsity Team. 
### 
Tomorrow's try-out to lie held on
the oval will tend to show what
men Stanford will send to the Ber
keley track next week. Although
the keenest competition its expected
in the quarter, half, and mile i uiih,
it in probable that contests will be
held in other events. It is not,
perhaps, thoroughly understood
that no one will be allowed to take
part in the Intercollegiate field-day
who has not made an excellent
showing here. No men will be
put on the cinder-track simplv to
"till up."
Among the most interesting
events in the Intercollegiate held
day will be the 100-yard and 220-
yard dashes. The men for the
Stanford team will be chosen from
Stewart, Bubb, Lamb, McCaughern,
H. L. Hamilton, and Dunn. Smith,
Chadbourne, Dunn, Birtch, and
Hobnail will try for places in the
quarter mile, while in the dis
tances we have the cross-country
trio, Chadbourne, W. R. Hamilton,
and Sprague. These men have
run in excellent time, equalling
their record of the inter-class field
day with Utile apparent effort.
Ellenwood, Talbot, Hawley, and
Knight may also try for places in
the half, with Thomas, Nangle, and
Harkins possibilities in the mile.
Naramore, Kuhn, Taylor, and
North have been training constant
ly at the high hurdles, and in the
low sticks, Mills, Dunn, and Beebe
have good chances to win places
also. ~
Beach, Dole, Henley, or Foster
will win the pole-vault, and with
Preston the places in high jump.
Symonds, Lyon, or Henley will win
places in the broad jump, Brooke,
liilman, Nichols points in the hum
nier-throw, and with McFadden and
Hyde, we ought to get two places
in the shot-put. Zschbkke will
undoubtedly be the winner in the
mile walk, with Lewis a possible
third.
The Berkeley track in spile- of
being cramped is fast, the take-off
for the jump is good, and there
will doubtless be several records
broken when the Cardinal meets
the Blue and Gold next week.
