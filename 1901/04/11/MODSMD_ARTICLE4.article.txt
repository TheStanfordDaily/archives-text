### 
Prof. El wood Meat!, head of the
department of irrigation at the
University of California, and irri
gation expert for the United States
Department of Agriculture, ad
dressed a number of students in
room 2 this afternoon. His sub
ject, "Ownership of Water," is one
of vast importance to people of arid
districts or of those sections of coun
try needing irrigation.
Mr. Mead gave an historical ac
count of the growth of water-rights
from the time of ancient Rome un
til the present day.
"The value of water-rights de
pends on the priority of its claim.
The Code of Justinian makes water
common property; in Spain the
ownership of water-rights is coin
cident with land ownership. In
California rights are established by
suits at law and when acquired are
perpetual, and usually have no
connection with use or ownership
of land.
"In Colorado, all decrees giving
water-rights grant a continuous
supply; the right can be sold or
rented or dealt with as any per
sonal property. There ate no re
strictions on the owner as to place
of delivery or the amount of water
supplied, but the user is restricted
in time and for specific use, where
as, if by any accident the water
supply gives out, the user is still
under obligations for rental price,
nor can he (the user) move his sup
ply from place to place as needed.
"in Wyoming the owner of land
is entitled to enough water to
moisten the land sufficiently for
good crops."
The speaker is of the firm opinion
that ownership in water should be
coincident with ownership in land.
