# BASEBALL
## Men Hard at Work.—Second Intercollegiate Game to be Played on the Campus Saturday. 
### 
During the past week the base
ball squad has been conscientious
ly working to improve the form
which they displayed last Satur
day. In practice the team shows
up well, but what the men will do
in a game is open to speculation.
The great trouble with our nine
this year is that they have not had
enough practice in games. The
second team, if any really existed,
was disorganized in the middle of
the season, and the Varsity has
practiced alone. The result is that
we have developed practice players
who go to pieces in a game.
The team has undergone a few
changes since last Saturday. 'I lie
in-field will remain the same, but
the out-field will be shaken Up.
Brown, who played a star out
field against Berkeley, will be
shifted from right field to left,
where he will get more chances.
Symonds will remain in center,
while Bennett, who has shown
such good form in pitching, will
play right unless his services are
required at the slab. Bennett is a
fast, reliable man and always shows
up strong in a game. The change
will undoubtedly improve the
play.
Barker is still showing much im
provement, and the experience
which he gained from the last
game should make him quite effec
tive Saturday.
The teams will face each other
as follows:
