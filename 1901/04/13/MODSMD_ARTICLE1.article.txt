# STANFORD 15, CALIFORNIA 4.
## The 						Cardinal Nine Outplays the Blue and Gold in the Second Game of the Intercollegiate Series. 
### 
With all the formalities of an
intercollegiate contest, including
brass bands, organized rooters, and
Hying colors, Berkeley and Stan
ford struggled for nine innings on
the diamond in a game upon
which, so far as Stanford was con
cerned, depended the baseball
championship of 1901. Ihe
bleachers were crowded and their
yells of encouragement filled the air
whenever the bands were resting.
The game, from the standpoint
of a baseball critic, was not worth
t lie price of admission, as Berkeley
at no stage of the game figured in
the argument, putting up a poor
and ragged exhibition. Stanford
seemed determined to win, and no
efforts on the part of their oppo
nents could stop them from piling
up the score. California lost heart
after the first few innings and all
that she could do afterward was to
prevent the disgrace of a close-out.
For the five first innings no Berkeley
man finished his journey around
the bags, while in the meantime
Stanford had baited one pitcher
out of the box, and piled up thir
teen runs. Berkeley made her first
two runs in the sixth inning and
scored her last two in the eighth.
Stanford scored every round, with
the exception of the sixth and
seventh.
Parker was the man who was
more than anyone else responsible
for our victory. He was at all times
a puzzle to the Berkeley batsmen.
He took part in the most difficult
play of the game, and he watched
the bags and (ielded his position in
perfect style. He also helped to
win his own game by getting two
base hits. Only second to the work
of Parker was that of Ball and Sy
monds. Ball caught a pretty
game and was always steady and
sure. He ran out behind the
Berkeley bench and caught a high
fonl which seemed impossible. Sy
monds accepted eight difficult
chances, some of which were the
prettiest catches seen in the out
field this season. The rest of the
team played good ball, as is seen
from the small sum of errors.
Murphy, Edwards, and Cowden
were in their best form.
For Berkeley, Smith played a
hard, steady game, but his team
mates did not assist him. Nourse
was n failure in the box, and Over
all was far from effective. He did
not succeed in stopping the Stan
ford procession around the bags,
but tended to be wild and was bit
frequently.
Berkeley was first at bat, and the
first ball pitched rolled down to
third and diet Murphy made a
pretty assist to first, opening the
game auspiciously for Stanford.
Smith flew out to Svnionds Bralev
went to first on Misner's error,
Kennedy took a pass on four balls,
and Hamlin flew out to center, re
tiring the side.

Murphy stepped to the plate lirst
for Stanford and was robbed of a
hit bv the breaking of liis bat.
Edwards took four balls, and Cow
den advanced hi in a stage by a
pretty base hit, and both took an
other peg on Nourse's wild pitch.
Ed wards scored on Gardner's error,
and Cowden followed him home on
Hunter's error in Handling a thrown
ball. Symonds stole second and
went to third on Gardner's error.
Hnli was hit I»y a pitched bail,
stole second and went to third
on Beimel's sacrifice, on which
Symonds scored. Brown's out to
second retired the side. Score, 3 to
0 in Stanford's favor.
In the second stage of the argu
ment, Gardner started his journey
on Murphy's error, and King fol
lowed on Misner's muff, but both
died on the bags on three consecu
tive outs.
Misner opened the second half of
the second inning by going to the
three-quarter post on King's error.
Parker went to lirst on four bad
ones. Murphy, the batter, and the
two runners took a hag on balls,
Misner scoring. Murphy and Par
ker scored wn Edwards' hit and
Edwards went to second on Ham
lin's error in handling Cowden's
drive; but the side was retired be
fore he scored. Score, 6-0.
Berkeley failed to score in the
third, fourth, and fifth, while Stan
ford continued to pile up runs.
The Berkeley team seemed to go
completely to pieces. Overall re
placed the much-troubled Notirse
in the fourth inning, but the
slaughter continued.
Hamlin was the first Blue and
Gold player to cross the plate. He
went to lirst on a hit and to third
on plays to first, scoring on a passed
ball. MeKeown, who walked to
first, also tallied in this inning. In
the eighth Overall and MeKeown
crossed the plate, making the linal
score 15 to 4.
The features of the game were
the catches of Symonds in center
field, the put-outs by Parker on
lirst base assisted by Mistier after
the ball had been fumbled by Cow
den, and Ball's c;itcb of a high foul.
