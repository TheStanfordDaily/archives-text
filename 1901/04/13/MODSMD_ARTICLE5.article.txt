# FRESHMEN DOWN SOPHS
## 1904 Wins the Third Annual Inter-Class Debate.â€”Promise of Varsity Material. 
### 
The third annual Freshman-
Sophomore debate was held in the
chapel Friday evening. The sub
ject for debate was, "Resolved,
That the extinction of the Boer re
publics is for the best interests of
civilization." The Class of 1903
upheld the affirmative, while 1904
supported the negative. Prof. C.
A. Duniway presided.
The first speaker on the affirma
tive was F. Nangle, '03. Nangle
simply and forcefully outlined the
position of the affirmative as fol
lows: "We of the affirmative hold
that the condition of affairs exist
ing before the late Boer war was
an unnatural one. Two civiliza
tions, essentially different, were at
tempting to live side by side. On
one hand we find the Boers com
prising one third of the population
and paying but one-tenth of the
taxes controlling the government,
while on the other hand were the
English owning almost all of the
property and being unrepresented
in the government. The condi
tions for an Outlander's obtaining
the franchise were almost prohibi
tive, there was no freedom of the
press, Boer religion was simply
seventeenth century bigotry, and
in economic affairs conditions
could not be worse. From such
conditions as these it can easily be
seen that some change must take
place, and this change could only
be brought about by the extinction
of the Boer republics and the
setting up of Anglo-Saxon civiliza
tion."
O. C. Spencer, '04, followed for
the negative. Spencer showed that
the policy of England had been
one of aggression, that the Boers
had done their best to avert war,
conceding all the demands of Eng
land. but that nothing except ex
tinction of the Boers in South
Africa would suit her.
A. 1\ Harris, '03, followed for the
affirmative. Harris argued that
the fusion of the two races in South
Africa was necessary. While the
Boer republics existed there could
be no such fusion, on account of the
extortionate demands of the Boers
and the lack of British representa
tion in the government. He said
that the case of South Africa repre
sented the old rule of the survival
of the fittest, and that if the inter
ests of civilization were furthered
it was only just that the Boer re
publics should cease to exist.
Roehr, '04, now spoke for the
negative, lioehr answered the last
speaker, claiming that the English
did not embark in the war with
South Africa with the purpose of
advancing civilization, but in the
lust for political domination. He
said the fusion of the two peoples
could have been accomplished in a
more peaceful manner except for
the covetous ambition of Cecil
Rhodes and some of his fellow
schemers.
C. I). McComfsh was the third
speaker on the affirmative. He
said, "This was simply a contest
between seventeenth and twentieth
