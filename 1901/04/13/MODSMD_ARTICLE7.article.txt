The showing made by the first
year men in their debate with the
Sophomores last night was even
stronger than those expected who
were cognizant of the good work
that has been accomplished during
the year in the Freshman society.
The enthusiasm generated by inter
class rivalry was strongly apparent
both in the contestants and in their
supporters, and the event was
worthy of a much larger audience.
The debate was doubly significant
as giving the first decided indica
tion of the value of the new debat
ing system as it applies to inter
class debates. That the winning
team's native ability carried them
a long way toward victory cannot
be denied; but it was also patent
that each of the men has gained
immeasurably by his experience
in the society. The system inaug
urated this year of confining Fresh
man debaters to a society of their
own has evolved from the experi
mental stage, and must be termed
an unqualified success.
