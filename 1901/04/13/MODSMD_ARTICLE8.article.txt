# A 						Texas Letter.
## 
### 
The "Athletic department" re
cently received an interesting let
ter from a prominent lawyer of
Georgetown, Texan, who was evi
dently under the impression thai
our athletes are supported by the
University. The letter reads hh
follows:
"President Athletic Department:â€”
1 have been informed that the Ath
letic department of the Leland
Stanford Jr. University desires a
runner for that special department
If such is the case, I wish to recom
mend to you a young man living
in this place who is easily the fast
est amateur runner for 100 yards
and less, so far as the records show,
on earth to date. He has made
the 100 yards in 9$ seconds mini
hers of times, and could have ex
ceeded that had he been urged by
worthy competition. This
man has never gone into real
training for the purpose of real
or professional running, and has,
therefore, never been in proper
form for his greatest possible
speed. By proper training be can
reduce the record of 9 3-5 seconds
now held by 10. Donovan, the pro
fessional.
"He can also be placed in such

form as to reduce all records up to
and including the 220 yard dash.
As it now stands, this young man
holds the second best record in the
world, having made the same at
Dallas, San Antonia, and various
places, being recognized as the
fastest in the State.
"What do you offer for such a
man? Kindly let me hear from
you at once, and 1 shall not write
either Yale or Harvard in his he
half until your reply arrives."
A reply to the above communi
cation has been bent. It is to the
effect that Stanford offers no special
inducements to secure athletes, but
any young man qualified to enter
the University is given an oppor
tunity to gain a practical college
education.
