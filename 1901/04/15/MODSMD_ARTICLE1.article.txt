# DARTMOUTH'S PRESIDENT.
## Dr. William Jewell Tucker Delivers a Strong Address in the University Chapel. 
### 
The chapel was crowded to its
utmost capacity this afternoon to
hear Dr. William Jewell Tucker of
Dartmouth College. Dr. Tucker
said:
I understand it is the price you
are accustomed to [jay to hear vis
itors who come to look upon the
only satisfactory group ol build
ings in the West, that you take any
chance message they may bring.
So I offer only a few observations.
Every thinking man must have
noticed the remarkable educational
expansion of this country lately.
So it would be utterly impossible
for any German or English in
structor to understand the rapidity
and solidity of the growth of be
hind Stanford Jr. University. Let.
us try to understand this and to
understand the s pi lit within it.
I am impressed with the valuation
placed in East and West on learn
ing. It is true that great subjects
are never worn out, but their fer
tility and interest often dies. The}'
become conventionalized and lose
in value. That had happened
within the last generationâ€”nay,
within my own life. It has not
been until within the last ten years
that men and women went to edu
cational institutions for entirely
educational reasons, but because
these were social institutions. Once
there they ca me under t he infiuence
of certain competitions which made
them work,
Later there came a preponder
ance of athletics, which did much
to save the moral life of the uni
versities. Hut they came because
of the lack of the spirit of
learning. Within the last ten
years this spirit has revived, the
old subjects feeling the impulse as
well as the new ones. Another fac
tor is the incoming of new mind,
mind out of new environment,
ready to attack the problems oi
education. Much fruitful soil has
been overlooked in the masses of
foreign population here. 1 welcome
any man to Dartmouth, coming
from 1 care not where, who brings
a passion for investigation. Learn
ing should be pursued for its own
sake as well as for the benefits
which come from it.
Men who have left college and
men who have never been to col
lege have, during the past decade,
changed materially in their atti
tude toward truth. Formerly, and
largely through the influence of
the Civil War, men were of the af
firming type. 'The thinker did not
ask; he affirmed. Hut this gener
ation is of an inquiring, doubting
mind. We look at propositions
steadily which the men before us
would not have considered. Hence
there is a growing fellowship be
tween different professions and be
tween different departments of
thought. Science and religion are
no longer at war. Men understand
one another and see, eye to eye.
And, again, there is an adjust
ment of higher education to the
needs of the individual, fitting him
better for the needs of society. We
have yet to prove, however, that

we can, by our methods, produce
better men than those of the past.
Hut the college has come to he
nearer to the masses than it ever
was before, and our thoughts help
others, even if they do not agree
with us.
We of the East have traditions
which help us and traditions which
hamper us. You of Stanford are
building yours. You can teach us
much. It has been an inspiring
season for me to touch the life here,
swift and stimulating in its young
power.
