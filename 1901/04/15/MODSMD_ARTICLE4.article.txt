# South Sea Collection.
## 
### 
Dr. John D. Grissen of San Jose
brought a small but valuable col
lection of articles from the South
Sea Islands to the Museum Satur
day. The collection was donated
by a patient of Dr. Grissen, and
comes as a legacy, the donator de
siring that it be left in safe and
competent hands. The articles
were gotten in the years 1849 and
1850 on this Coast from sailors
who had brought them from the
Southern Archipelago. 'There are
about thirty pieces in thecollection,
among which are twelve pieces of
coral, representing nine different
species, fifteen shells, some large
and beautiful, a shark-hook made
from shell and bound with fibre, a
very large stingaree sword, and a
small polished cocoanut rattle.
These will be placed on exhibition
in the corridor of the Museum.
