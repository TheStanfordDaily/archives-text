# COMBINED CONCERT.
## Saturday's Entertainment by Berkeley and Stanford Musical Clubs Proved Very Successful. 
### 
The musical clubs of Stanford
and California appeared in a very
successful combined concert in As
sembly Hall Saturday evening.
'The audience, although somewhat
meagre on account of various other
attractions, which, by the way,
could and should have been post
poned on such an occasion, was
agreeably entertained.
Comparison of the ability of the
various clubs is a difficult as well
as a delicate task to attempt. None
of the organizations have done
much concert work this year, and
their showing was a little below
the usual standard. The best re
ceived club numbers were the
"Hold, Had Man," a catchy encore
of the U. C. Glee; ' Love's Old
Sweet Song," Stanford Glee; "Car
dinal Forever," Stanford Mandolin,
and "'The Fortune-teller Waltzes,"
U.C. Mandolin. "Ye Boston Tea
Party," of the U. C. Hanjo Club,
was enthusiastically encored.
The individual numbers were
varied and excellent. Schwartz's
monologues gained favor with repe
tition; Gilman,'ol, was at his best
in bis solo, ''The Bandolero";
Eichelroth, as prestidigitator, per
formed some of Herrman's most
amazing (ricks with adroitness
fully equal to that of the late ma
gician; while the initial appearance
of Hans Barkan, '04, proved him a
tasteful and sympathetic violinist.
