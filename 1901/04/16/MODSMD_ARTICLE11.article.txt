It is unfortunate that the in
tercollegiate athletic agreement
with Berkeley was not adopted with
the proviso originally included, â€”
that whenever a third baseball
game lias to he played during it
series, it should take place on the
campus of that university on which
the tield-day is not held. This
would he eminently fair. What
ever advantage the home nine
would have hy using its own dia
mond would be off-set in the field
contest when the men of the other
university use their own track.
Should it he decided to play the
third game at Berkeley, or even in
Oakland, this year, Stanford stu
dents will have just cause for com
plaint. Within one week after at
tending the field-day across the
hay, few will he able to afford the
time and expense required to go
from here for the game.
