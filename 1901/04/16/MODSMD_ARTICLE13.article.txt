# "Christian Missions in China."
## 
### 
The services at the chapel Sun
day morning were supplemented
by special Easter music. The Rev.
Geo. B. Smyth, 1). D., who delivered
the sermon, took occasion to en
lighten the congregation on the
Christian missionary situation in
China and to correct impressions
that may have been based on
erroneous newspaper statements.
Mr. Smyth has been a missionary
in Chir.a for seventeen years and
is well qualified to speak with
knowledge on this practical ques
tion of the day. In brief he said:
"The objections to missionary
work are that it is unnecessary
and an insult to the Chinese. But
Christian missionary work is done
in obedience to the positive com
mand and wish of Jesus; it is a
matter of personal loyality to the
Master, and it is utterly useless to
attempt doing away with the mis
sionary work so long as the feeling
of personal loyality exists in the
hearts of men.
"Men in Ihe Far East are con
scious of something wrong in
China the temples to Confucius
and Buddha are evidences that the
Chinese are conscious of their guilt
and wish to re establish friendly
relations with Cod. The Christian
church has a rich possession in the
knowledge of Cod. The great ob
ject of missionary work is to pro
claim the news of Cod. It presents
a Cod whose character is the high
est standard of virtue, it proclaims
a saviour Cod, and the possibility
of close personal relations of man
towards Cod.
"The charge of missionary work
being an insult to the Chinese is
not well founded, for the Chinese
centuries ago repudiated Confucian
ism because it did not proclaim the
possibility of establishing a per
sonal relation to Cod.
"The religion of China is the re
sult of great missionary endeavors
from the outside world. Chinese
owe much to Buddhism, some of
their finest chara teristics are due
to Buddhistic teaching, which en
tered China in response to a call
of Providence itself. But it has
spent its force.
"The charge that our missionar
ies are tactless is serious, if true.
If it is true, it means that the ma
jority of Christian men and women
are possessed of very little common
sense. A large majority of the
missionaries live scattered about in
the interior of China, far distant
from the protection of consuls or
gunboats and their success, their
very lives depend upon the consid
eration they show the natives. If
the charge is true, it means
that the fault lies with the
churches in the Christian
countries, that the men and women
sent are not intellectually sym
pathetic, and who cannot get into
close intellectual and moral fellow
ship with the natives.
"We forget the isolation in which
China has grown up. It has devel
oped out of its own genius and
light; they have been looked upon
as the teachers of (he world, and it
is not easy for them to surrender
their position.
"In regard to the recent upris
ings: If the uprisings were a pro
test against missionary work, the
outrages would have been con thud
to the sections where Christian
missions a re most numerous; where
as, the Boxer movement was strictly
confined to that region where for
eign aggressions were strongest."
