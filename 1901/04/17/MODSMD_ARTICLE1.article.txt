# SENIOR FARCE.
## Erb and Bradley's Clever Extravaganza to be Produced During Commencement Week. 
### 
William M. Erb, 01, and C. M.
Bradley, '01, were awarded the
fifty-dollar prize yesterday for an
elaborate extravaganza to he given
by the Senior Class during Com
mencement Week in May. Ihe
farce is a travesty on the old plays
dealing with royalty. The Uni
versity is turned into the kingdom
of Leeland with a king, queen, and
princess, knights, and other per
sonages of a royal household. Ihe
daughter of the Leeland, the prin
cess, has many suitors, among them
the repulsive king of Mi 1 pitas, a
rival royal house, to whom the
queen wishes the princess to he
married for social reasons. The
king of Leeland has offered, how
ever, to give her hand to the knight
who shall rid the realm of a dragon,
which is laying the country waste,
his ravings being due to a severe
pain in his stomach. The situa
tions in the play are startling and
humorous. A large chorus will be
used and the farce is full of catchy
songs. The play will be the most
elaborate given since the produc
tion of Will H. Irwin's extrava
ganza, "Atalanta in Stanford."
Both Bradley and Erb have
been identified with college literary
activities from the first. They
were the authors of the last year's
Junior farce, "Seven I Jobbers
Down."
