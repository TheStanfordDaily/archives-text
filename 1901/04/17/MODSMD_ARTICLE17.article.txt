Contributions for sending the
University hand to San Jose to aid
in the reception of President Mo-
Kin ley have not heen coming in as
fast as they should; in fact the hox
which has been placed on the quad
for donations has been ignored by
faculty and students alike. This
is hardly the proper attitude of an
educational center toward a na
tional executive. But one day of
grace is left in which all of those
who have not thoroughly inspected
the afore-mentioned box will have
an opportunity to do so, and at the
same time pay not more than
twenty-five cents for the privilege.
