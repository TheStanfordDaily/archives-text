# English Club Meets.

### 
By invitation of C. A. Whitmore,
the fortnightly meeting of the Eng
iihii Club Wiis held last evening at
the Chi Psi house. A full quota of
members and a few guests were
present. Following the business
session, at which the club decided
to take no present action in regard
to the proposed limitation of mem
bership, the company was enter
tained by Miss Adeline Knapp, of
Oakland, who is as charming a
story-teller as she is an authoress.
The club, although in its in
fancy, is in a flourishing condition,
ils rolls containing names of forty
members.
