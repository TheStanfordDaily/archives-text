Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The splendid allowing made by
the Freshman debaters in the re
cent inter-class debate exceeded the
highest expectations of those who a
year ago advocated and succeeded
in securing the establishment of aj
Freshman debating society. Ihe
Freshman representatives were un
questionably the three strongest de
baters of their class. In no pre
vious iliter-class debate has this
been true. This is one of the good
results brought about by a class
org a nidation.
The success, however, of this ex
periment suggests the advisability
of a further change. Wby not sub
stitute a. system of class societies
for our present system/ All the
advantages which may be urged in
favor of a Freshman society apply
with equal force in favor ofa Soph
omore, or Junior, or Senior organi
zation. The present luke-warm
loyalty of a debater to his society
would be very much stimulated by
bringing into it the element, of
class spirit. Under present condi
tions the work of our debating so
cieties is not as intense as it ought
to be. They have much to con
tend with in the way of securing
the attendance of members by rea
son of the various counter attrac
tions on ihe only night on which
they can conveniently meet. Jf in
terest wavers, the usefulness of the
society is impaired. The infusion
of the element of class spirit, by in
creasing the rivalry of our societies,
would do much to give a more vig
orous and healthful tone to our de
bating associations
One of the strongest criticisms
that can be urged against the pres
ent system is that it does not suc
ceed in inducing students to join
one of the societies early enough in
their college career. There are
many students who, because of not
having joined a society early
enough, fail to derive much of the
benefit that might have been gained
had they affiliated themselves
with one earlier in their col
lege course, as they would
have done under a system
of class societies. Under the latter
system every student of debating
aspirations or literary abilities
would feel himse'f called upon by
the promptings of class patriotism
to ally himself with bis class so
ciety. Every student in the Uni
versity would teel a personal inter
est, in one of the societies —an in
terest strong enough to induce a
very considerable number of each
class to join the class organization.
The fact that our societies now
bear so little relation to class ac
tivities is undoubtedly a principal
explanation of ihe general student
indifference to our debating associ
a t ions.
The Freshman society has now
an opportunity of inaugurating
the movement toward class socie
ties !>v making its organization
permanent, and thus continuing
the advantages which such organi
zation has given the class in the
direction of class activity. W bet her
the old societies should be dis
banded and reorganization effected
on the basis of a class division is
perhaps of doubtful expediency.
They would at any rate die out at
the end of two more years, while
the success of the class system
would be made certain by the per
petuation of the under-cla«s socie
ties.
