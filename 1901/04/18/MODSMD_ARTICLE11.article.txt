Today we publish an article on
our outlook in the Intercollegiate
Field-day next Saturday. From
it one would judge that we shall
probably make a very fair showing,
although chances of winning ap
pear to be against uh. The meet
will be held on the Berkeley cam
pus this year, and as many stu
dents as possible should attend it.
No one should become discouraged
at our past defeats in track con
tests and stay away from this on
account of them. Nothing shows
off college spirit to better advan
tage than when a university gives
its unanimous support to a team
which goes up against heavy odds.
Such enthusiasm will instil
strength into any team and make
it determined to do its best. Let
every one attend Saturday's inter
collegiate track meet and show that
there is plenty of college spirit left
at Stanford.
