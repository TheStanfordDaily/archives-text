Tickets are now on sale at the
University Bookstore and at the
drugstores in Palo Alto for Heton-
Thompson's lectures in the As
sembly Hall and in the Methodist
Church in Palo Alto. The Detroit
Union has this to say ahout the
brilliant lecturer:
"Always interesting, sometimes
fascinating, often thrilling, the lec
ture given by Ernest Seton-Thomp
son last night in the Light Guard
Armory, on 'Wild Animals I Have
Known' was far from the Held of
the ordinary lecturer. The im
mense audience listened with a
breathless attention to the speaker
as he took them with him from
his shanty door to the innermost
recesses of the forest, over trails
and into unexplored spots, and
finally away up into Manitoba,
where the lecture was brought to a
close by the killing of a magnifi
cent moose.
"With the use of the stereopti
con, almost every sentence uttered
by Mr. Seton-Thompson was ac
companied by a picture which so
fully illustrated the thought he was
presenting as to make the listener
forget he was not participating in
the actual incident. The pictures
are the result of this gifted man's
own pencil and brush and camera,
\vbiÂ« li are as much a part of his
hunting and traveling outfit as a
gun and a dog. With a remark
able gift for mimicry be gave the
pretty trills and songs of the birds,
the peculiar barks of the hunting
dogs, the cries of wild animals,
even to the challenge cry of the
stag of the mountains of Europe."
(Then followed a two-column no
tice of the lecture.)
