# SATURDAY TRACK MEET.
## Stanford's Showing Will Probably Be Better Than During the Past Three Years. 
### 
The training for this year's track
team its now over and the remain
ing time before the Field-day will
be spent by the men in resting.
The chances for a Stanford victory
are not great, but our team should
roll tip a larger score than we have
made in any of the three past
intercollegiate lield meets. Cali
fornia will put forth probably the
strongest team that she has ever
had, but even her collection of stars
cannot prevent Stanford from run
ning up a heavy score. In both of
the sprints, Stanford should win
two places, and should JMcCaugh
ern's leg be strong enough we may
win both of these events. Each of
our other runners in these events,
Lamb, Hamilton, and Bubb, can
cover the distances faster than any
of the Berkeley men with the ex
ception of Cadogan, and even that
runner will have to exert himself to
the utmost to win out.
Smith and Dunn should take
two places in the quarter mile, and
we have a good man to back up
these two in Holman.
The prettiest races in the meet
will be the half and the mile.
Service has run both of these in
record time and on Saturday will
attempt to win both events. Stan
ford has no one man who can beat
this runner in both races, but by
dividing our strength we may be
able to win in one. With Hamil
ton, Chadbourne, Sprague, Ellen
wood, Talbot, Hawley, and Nangle,
we have an excellent team which
will win a good aggregate of points.
The mile walk has been won by
Walsh for the last three years, but
he will meet his match in Zschokke,
who has worked hard and faithfully
and is in the best condition to
walk a hard race. Lewis will
tight it out with Allen and Delas
mutt for third place.
California has a slight advantage
in the hurdles, but our three men
Taylor, Naramore, and Kuhn are
running in good form and will give
a good account of themselves.
Plaw will win the hammer and
the shot, but Brooke will take
second place in the first event, and
in the shot we are well represented
by Hyde, Traeger, Brooke, and
Parker.
Stanford will win three places in
the polev-ault. Berkeley is weak
in this event while we are strong.
Our entries will be Dole, Beach,
Henley, and Foster.
Heniey will probably win the
broad and the high jumps. He is
in good condition and stands an
excellent chance of breaking the
records in both of these events.
We have a good opportunity of
getting places, besides winning
these contests. Dole, Preston, and
Beach are the equals of the Berke
ley athletes on the high jump, and
Preston, Symonds, and Lyons are
capable of making long jumps
when in competition.
