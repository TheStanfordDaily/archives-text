# TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
## Intercollegiate Matches Will Take Place at the California Club Courts Next Saturday. 
### 
On the California Club courts in
San Francisco next Saturday morn
ing, the singles of what promises to
he the most interesting Intercol
legiate Tennis tournament held for
some years will hegin promptly at
9 o'clock. Both contests are to lie
played at the same time, Weihe
meeting Selhy and Roth meeting
McGavin, and each will he decided
by three out of five. The singles
will probably consume from an
hour to an hour and a half, so that
people going from here Saturday
morning, leaving Palo Alto not
later than 8:30, may arrive in time
to see the doubles which follow im
mediately. The California players
will be well supported, and Mim
ager Leib urges as many Stanford
students as possible to he at the
games.
McGavin and Selhy will enter
both the singles and doi hies for
Berkeley. The match between
Weihe and Selhy will be even and
probably exciting. Selhy is a
senior at Berkeley and this is his
first year on the team, hut lie is
now doing far better work than
ever before. Weihe has defeated
Selhy in other tournaments, but he
is not in the best physical condi
tion and will have all he can do to
win his game. McGavin is a bril
liant player, but is at times erratic,
and this may give Roth, who has
an excellent tournament head, al
ways keeping his self-control, a
chance to win. If McGavin makes
a good start, however, Roth will
hardly be able to hold him down.
Stanford has an excellent show
of winning the doubles. Adams,
who plays with Weihe, will enter
fresh, while both Berkeley men
will be tired from having played in
the singles. Our players have been
in the city since Wednesday, prac
ticing on the courts.
