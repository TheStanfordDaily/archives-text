### 
The Hon. Whitelaw Ueid deliv
ered an entertaining address in the
Assembly Hall this afternoon. He
began with a reference to current
estimates of the world's progress in
the century ended four months ago.
The strides America has ma<ie in
this extraordinary century in sub
duing a continent, in spreading out
over the islands of the sea, in gain
ing and maintaining independence,
and in abolishing slavery, were not
its most important achievement.
That lay in building up from ocean
to ocean a gigantic system, free
practically to the poorest as well as
to the richest child of the Republic,
under which any man can learn
anything.
The lecturer referred to Stanford
University as perhaps the greatest
and certainly the most beneficent
monument of parental grief the
world had ever seen, and paid a
warm tribute to the Stanfords, and
to the University. He said in part:
"An acute English observer, Mr.
Bryce, remarks that German uni
versities are popular but not free;
English universities free but not
popular; and American universi
ties both popular and free. But
the popularity will lie harmful if it
degenerates into a vulgar catering
for numbers by throwing down the
bars of admission which time and
experience have sanctioned; and
the liberty will be disastrous if it
degenerates into license,â€”whether
for the students in their conduct
or for the professors in their teach
ing -
"The freedom for a stuuent which
absolves him from the obligations
of a gentleman is no better and no
worse than the freedom for a pro
fessor which absolves him from the
duties of a scholar and a patriot,
and converts his relations to his
country into railings against its
present and its past policy, rather
than the exercise of an influence
justly belonging to the highly edu
cated and highly placed upon his
country's future. It is a misfor
tune for the colleges, and no less
for the country, when the trusted
instructors are out of sympathy
with its history, with x its develop
ment, and with the men who made
the one and are guiding the other."
