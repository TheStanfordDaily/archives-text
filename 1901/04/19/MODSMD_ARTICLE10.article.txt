If ability and experience count
for anything, the Cardinal team
should capture the coveted debat
ing championship tomorrow even
ing. Hut conditions are not such
as to warrant over-confidence. The
question for discussion is as trouble
some a one as a University debater
ever had to deal with. A single
false Btep, a misstatement, may
mean defeat to an apparently in
vulnerable side. Our men have
put grinding hours on the question,
and seem to have every loophole
sedulously guarded. We hope for,
we expect victory, but the team has
our confidence, whatever the re
sult. And het us remember —what
is too prone to he forgotten in the
spectacular whirlwind of athletics —
that victory on the debating plat
form means far more to the present
and future of the University than
triumph out-of doors, which, in the
last analysis, is merely muscular.
