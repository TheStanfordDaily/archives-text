Tomorrow Stanford will face an
other important epoch of its his
tory, and it is hoped it will result
as favorably as the preceding events
of this year. We have an excellent
chance of taking more than half
of the honor sit stake. The debate
and tennis should be won by
Stanford teams, and the track of
fers a fighting possibility. The
goal we are striving for, a Cardi
nal year, is much nearer realiza
tion than at the beginning of the
football season. Therefore we
should be greatly encouraged to do
our utmost. By Herculean efforts
we may take all three contests.
Berkeley will have a great advan
tage in being nearer at home. Her
rooters and sympathizers have in
variably outnumbered our own in
all contests held at San Francisco,
and of course this advantage will
be more marked on her own cam
pus. Consequently it is incumbent
upon every Stanford student and
sympathizer to be present as far as
possible at all of tomorrow's events.
Proper encouragement, from the
side-lines if of absolnle necessity in
a doubtful or up-hill content. With
this encouragement our chances of
victory will be immeasurably
brightened.
