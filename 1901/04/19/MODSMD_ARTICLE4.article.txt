# DEBATERS READY.
## Detailed Arrangements for the Ninth Intercollegiate Contest.â€”Men and Their Records. 
### 
Tomorrow night in Metropolitan
Temple, San Francisco, Stanford
and Berkeley will meet for the
ninth time in intercollegiate de
bate. The Cardinal team, while
expecting to hear off the victory,
are not over-confident, and have
worked on the question until every
possible loophole in the affirma
tive argument seems to be closed.
They returned this afternoon from
a short rest at Kings Mountain,
and will attend the rally tonight,
leaving for the city in the morn
ing.
The question for discussion is to
be, "Resolved, That the extinction
of the Boer republics is for the per
manent interests of civilization."
California has the negative, Stan
ford the affirmalive.
Two of Stanford's debaters are
experienced men, while the third,
although facing Berkeley for the
first time, has the entire confidence
of the student body.
William Alfred Morris, leader of
the affirmative, is a senior in His
tory, and prepared for college in
Willamette University at his home
in Salem, Oregon. In his sopho
more year he was a member of hi*
victorious class team in the first
Sophomore-Freshman debate, and
this year won lasting fame by cap
turing the Carnot medal. He is a
member of Euphronia literary so
ciety.
William Carl Morrow, second
negative debater, is also a '01
man, a History major, and an Ore
gonial), his home being in Portland.
He was a member of the now de
funct belaud debating society, but
has never entered an intercollegiate
try-out until this year.
Cecil Mortimer Marrack, Stan
ford's third speaker, is a senior and
registers in English from San Fran
cisco. His experience outweighs
that of his colleagues, as it includes
places with Morris on the victorious
Sophomore team of '01, on the Car
not and Intercollegiateteams of last
year, and on this season's Carnot.
He is a member of Euphronia.
Our most formidable Blue and
Gold opponent is William B. Gree
ley, who prepared at the San Jose
High School and entered Berkeley
after a year's study at Stanford.
Jessie H. Steinluirl's intercollegi
ate debating career commenced with
bis appearance on this year's Car
not team.
Ralph S. Pierce, '01, was Berke
ley's alternate in the last Carnot
debate, ibis being his first appear
ance in a major contest.
The alternate for Stanford is Ed
ward W. Bice, '02, a class debater
and a member of Nestoria. For
Berkeley, Leon E. Martin, 02, a
recent Carnot contestant, occupies
the substitute's position.
Metropolitan Temple, where the
event is to occur, is easy of access,
being situated on Fifth street, a
few steps from Market and two
blocks above the Call building.
The debate commences promptly
at eight o'clock, ending in ample
time to allow those who wish to
catch the 11:45 train for Palo Alto.
