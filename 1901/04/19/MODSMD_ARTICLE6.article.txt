## Dr. G.A. Miller of Cornell Appointed Assistant Professor of Mathematics. 
### 
The Department of Mathematics
announces the appointment of Dr.
G. A. Miller of Cornell University
to be assistant professor of Mathe
matics. liis duties will begin next
September, and he will take up the
courses formerly taught by Profes
sor Little.
Dr. Miller will be a valuable ad
dition to the Mathematics depart
ment. He has an enviable record
in this field of science, and is
looked upon as one of the foremost
authorities on substitution groups.
He was born in Pennsylvania,
and entered Franklin and Marshal
College at the age of nineteen.
Later be attended Muklenbery Col
lege at Allentown, Pennsylvania,
from which institution he gradu
ated in 1886. Immediately alter
graduation he was appointed pro
fessor of mathematics in Eureka
College, Illinois. He remained
there for five years, doing much
special work during this period,
and in 1893 he accepted a position
at the University of Michigan. In
1595 Dr. Miller resigned his posi
tion at Michigan and went to Ger
many and France, where he spent
two years in special research work.
During his year in Germany, he
was a pupil of the great Norwegian
professor, Sophus Tie, and in
France worked under Professor
Jordan, both <>112 whom are the fore
most authorities on groups in the
world. On his return in 1898 he
accepted a position at Cornell Uni
versity, where, in addition to his
university duties, he has done a
great deal of special work.
Dr. Miller is one of the leading
mathematical writers in the United
States at tbe present time. His
articles are constantly appearing
in the American Mathematical
Journal. 'Many of his articles have
appeared in the English Quarterly
Journal of Mathematics, and quite
a few of them have been presented
to tbe French Academy by the two
foremost mathematicians of France,
Jordan and Picard, and have been
published in the Comtes Ren dim.
He also received from the Academy
of Science at Cracaw, Austria, a
gold medal for work in substitu
tion groups. Dr. Miller is a mem
ber of the American Mathematical
Society, the London Mathematical
Society, the Mathematical Society
of France, and that of Germany,
Altogether he is the author of six
ty-six published papers on mathe
matical subjects arid investigations.
