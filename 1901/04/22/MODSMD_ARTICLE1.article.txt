Cardinal Debaters, Racket-Wieldere,
and Track Athletes Succumb
to California.
What ought to have been a two
out-of-three victory for Stanford
resulted in complete defeat at the
hands of the University of Cali
fornia Saturday. The Field-day
score fell but a little below expec
tations, but a combination of cir
cumstances arising from an off
day on the tennis players' part and
an up-hill side of a knotty iquestion
for the debaters — circumstances
which were measurably determined
by the ability of the Blue and Gold
athletes and orators —made the
day one of unalloyed triumph to
the Berkeleyans.
The Debate.
The disasters for Stanford were
complete Saturday evening when,
at the close of the Intercollegiate
Debate in Metropolitan Temple,
Hon. J. M. Seawell announced that
the majority of judges had voted to
award the decision to the negative,
represented by California. The
vote was two to one.
Stanford had advocated the af-*
firmative of the question, "He
solved, That the extinction of the
Boer republics is for the perma
nent interests of civilization." Our
team had worked up a magnificent
case, but Morris and Marrack
scarcely fulfilled their capabilities
in presentation. The Berkeley men
had prepared strong arguments
and they far exceeded any previ
ous efforts in delivery and force.
Morrow made a strong, clear, and
forcible speech.
Professor Charles M. (tavley of
Berkeley presided over the debate,
while C. E. Grunskv, Samuel
Knight, and Hon. J. M. Seawell, all
of San Francisco, acted as judges.
YV. C. Morrow opened the argu
ment for the affirmative, explain
ing that the permanent interests of
civilization involve all future gen
erations. With the aid of a map
he pointed out that south of Zam
besi the physical divisions of South
Africa consist of three regions,—
the narrow coast strip bordering
the Indian ocean, the hill slopes
rising west of this, and finally the
largest extent, reaching almost to
the Atlantic. There are no great
natural boundaries, and socially
the race'interests are closely allied.
The problem of the black men, who
outnumber the whites ten to one,
will always be serious. This eco
nomic interdependence of the whites
will grow more necessary, but the
Boer republics, isolated as they
are, pursuing the policy of inhu
man treatment of the natives, cor
rupt in their officials, medieval and
oligarchical mi form, are incapable
of dealing with the broader ques
tions bound to arise. The Dutch
people possess possibilities too great
to be sacrificed upon the altar of
seventeenth century civilization.
J. H. Steinhardt followed for the
negative, giving a history of the
Boer migrations to escape English
rule and oppression. He claimed
that their civilization is better
suited to South African conditions,
and that it advances with its de
mands. The people are hardy, tlie

country is agricultural. Upon ag
riculture the permanent develop
ment of the region must be based,
for the mines are only temporary.
English civilization is too far ad
vanced to deal with these simple
problems. The native problem is
also one for which Boer methods
furnish the best solution. In con
tact with the Boer, the native re
tains his virility and vigor, while
with the English he is enervated.
And, as a matter of fact, the Orange
Free State, the most advanced Boer
republic, exceeds in progressive
ness Cape Colony.
W. A. Morris of Stanford, con
tinuing for the affirmative, admit
ted that the Boers sire fitted to
farm in South Africa, and suggest
ed that they go out of the govern
ing business, for which they are not
fitted. Unity is essential to secure
the greatest advancement, and con
flict was inevitable to secure this
unity, just as was the conflict of
our own Civil war. Boer civiliza
tion, government, and religion are
two hundred years behind the
times. Two dozen families rule
the Transvaal as an oligarchy.
After inviting Uitlanders to settle
and develop the country, the Boers
by a system of class legislation
levied against them nine-tenths of
the taxes. The speaker recited the
list of foreign grievances and peti
tions for redress, and the failure of
the Transvaal government to grant
the rights asked.
Ralph S. Pierce, for the negative,
maintained that the republics
should not be destroyed because
they contain elements valuable to
the civilization of the entire world,
and thai the numerical predomi
nance of the Boers in the country
will always work against advance- {
jilient under the yoke of British
rule. Bv her policy toward the re
publics, England has already
stirred up the Boers of Natal and
the Cape Colony, previously peace
ful subjects, who can now be gov
erned only by arbitrary force. This
hinders civilization. In the Trans
vaal itself, Kruger came within
two hundred voteß of being defeat
ed for president by a man who ad
vocated more liberal policies, but
the English aggression has made
him secure in his position and con
firmed the non-progressive attitude.
The solution of the problems is a
fusion of the two races, combining
the ruggedness and familiarity with
the country of the Boer, with the
enterprise, ingenuity, and capital
of the Englishman.
C. M. Marrack, for the affirma
tive, deplored the horrors of the war
and reviewed the points of his two
colleagues, the first being that uni
fication is necessary, and the second
that race conflict made this im
possible by peaceful means. Eng
land, in protecting her citizens,
was forced to act in self-defense,
and prior occupancy must yield to
social superiority. The Boers
struck the first blow on the Natal
border, and did so to uphold the
right, of ruling by an oligarchy.
But a handful of British troops was
in the country at the outbreak of
the war. The integrity of the em
pire and the insolence of the Boers
brought on the conflict, of which
the military struggle is but an in

cident. Extinction of the Repub
lics would lead to political uni
fication.
W. B. Greeley closed for the
negative, stating that the solution
of the problem is in the peaceable
fusion of these two races. The
policy of extinction weakens the
power of Great Britain at its most
vital point, retarding the advance
ment of the world. England's real
strength in moral, standing for
supremacy of law and political
justice; this was the policy of Pitt
and of Gladstone. Her weakness
is in short-sighted jingo policy,
supported by North and by Dis
raeli. This aggression against
South American republics weakens
Great Britain's best tendencies,
strengthens her worst, and thus de
prives civilization of her best con
tribution.
Morris, in his closing rebuttal for
the affirmative, said that fusion and
reconciliation of the races can fol
low the war just as did that of the
Dutch and English in New York
and the French and English in
Canada.
This is the fifth debate won by
California. Stanford has won
four. The Hearst cup, held by
Stanford since the last year, goes to
Berkeley for the second time.
Stanford has won one debate since
the cup whb offered, and it will be
come the permanent property of
the university gaining the first
three victories.
Intercollegiate Tennis.
California won all three matches
in the Tenth Annual Intercollegiate
Tennis Contest Saturday by straight
sets series. The playing of Selby
and McGavin was a surprise to the
spectators, who were generally in
clined to expect a Stanford victory.
In the singles events Selby defeated
Weihe 6-2, 6-3, 6-8 in a match
that was much closer than the score
indicates, and McGavin won from
Both by a Hcore of 6-1, 8-6, 6-3
after a fast and brilliant exhibition.
The form of the Berkeley players
was superior to that of the Stan
ford men, an I showed the benefit
of hard and consistent training.!
The Stanford men persistently
played the net, but the strong fore
and back-hand drives of their op
ponents were invincible.
Selby, who was supposed to be an
easy mark for Weihe, played an ex
ceptionally good game, being
steadier and in much better form.,
Weihe's net playing was good and
his hard smashes were often bril
liant. He made a very plucky
stand in the second set to no effect
McGavin and Both played the
same sort of a game that the pre
vious players did. but Roth's net
game was ineffectual against the
well-placed drives of McGavin, who
was undoubtedly the star player of
the day. He continually passed
Roth on the side-lines, making
many brilliant back-hand drives.
Roth made a good start in the
second set, when he pulled out from
5-2 to 6-5, but lost 8-6, being un
able to withstand the swifter drives
of McGavin.
Before the tournament the
doubles had been generally con
ceded to the Stanford team, as
Adams and Weihe were supposed

j to have developed exceptional team
work. McGavin and Selby, how
ever, assumed the lead from the
start and won by a score of 7-5,
6-3, 6-3. Adams smashed and
drove exceedingly well, and Weihe
played a good game at the net.
Both, however, failed to play their
balls deep enough to have the best
effect. In this event, as in the
singles, the Berkeley men showed
better form. McGavin scored the
most aces. After many long ral
lies the point was usually won
through his accurate placing of a
swift drive.
Stanford 32, Californa 85.
Stanford lost the Tenth Annual
Field-day with Berkeley last Satur
day by a score of 85 to 32, and was
outclassed in every event except
the walk and the pole-vault, it
was evident that our athletes were
in poor physical condition, as was
shown by the fact that the walk
was the only distance event that a
Stanford man finished in without
total physical collapse. Zschokke
and Lewis deserve great credit for
their performance in the mile walk,
and the former's time will remain
as the record. Two men who
showed up well for the Cardinal
were Brooke and Hyde. Both of
these have trained hard, and both
will be winners in coming years.
The other point winners for
Stanford were Hamilton, Smith,
Chadbourne, Taylor, Dole, Beach,
Henley, and Lyons.
Six intercollegiate records were
broken and one equalled. Cado
gan lowered the time in the hun
dred from 10 1-5 seconds to 10 sec
onds flat, and clipped 3-5 of a
second from the time in the two
hundred and twenty yard dash,
sprinting the distance in 22 3-5
seconds. Service lowered the mile
record to 4:37 4-5, Powell and
Coolly tied in the high jump at 5
feel 104 inches, and Flaw raised
the shot-put record to 42 feet
inches. Zschokke made the best
record-breaking performance of the
day, lowe'ring the intercollegiate
record in the walk to 7:09 4-5.
The second half of the two hun
dred and twenty yard hurdles was
marred by an unfortunateaccident.
Naramore of Stanford was making
a brilliant try for a place in the
final, when he caught his foot on
the next to the last stick and fell,
striking the curbing of the track,
and breaking the left forearm just
above the wrist.
