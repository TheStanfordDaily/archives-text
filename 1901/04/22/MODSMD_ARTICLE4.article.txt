# Band Meeting.
## 
### 
The first regular practice of the
University band for the McKinley
demonstration in San Jose was
held last week. From now on
there will probably be two meet
ings a week. All the old favorite
inarches are being practised, with
the addition of Flint's "Cardinal
Forever." Hurlbut, '02, has been
elected leader. There q,re many
in the University who play band
instruments but have not been to
practice as yet. It is hoped that
as many as possible will be out in
order that a good showing may be
made.
