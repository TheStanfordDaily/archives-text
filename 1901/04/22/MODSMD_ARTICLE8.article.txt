# Seton-Thompson Tomorrow Night.
## 
### 
Ernest Seton-Thompson, who
lectures in the Assembly Hall to
morrow evening, is a man of charm
ing personality and he lectures in
a conversational way that at once
attracts the interest and attention
of his listeners and puts them at
home with him. He talks about
his animals as if they were his per
sonal friends, and thus at once
makes his audience interested in
them. He is so enthusiastic and
so full of his subject that almost
before we know it we are follow
ing the adventures of his animals,
as set forth in his stereopticon pic
tures, with breathless attention.
Mr. Thompson's personal appear
ance is hardly that which one
would attribute to a man who has
exhibited his spirit of daring and
bravery in becoming acquainted
with the "wild animals he has
known." He is tall and thin, with
no suggestion of robustness or
hardihood. His eyes are very ex
pressive and disclose, in their con
tinual wide sweeps, the observing
trait of the man. He has a keen
sense of humor, and makes the
sportsman who kills merely for the
sensation enjoyed in killing, the
object of his biting and telling sa
tire. He wins his audience at the
outset by his confiding air, and
when they leave, he is sure to
count them his friends and admir
ers.
His lecture on the "Personality
of Wild Animals" in the Metho
dist Church, Palo Alto, at 3 p.m.
tomorrow afternoon describes "The
Great Bears," "Little Johnny,"
"Soho," and many other of the
children's favorites. His lecture
on "Wild Animals 1 Have
Known," in the Assembly Hall, at
tomorrow evening, will con
sist of various stories about the
birds and animals in his book,
finishing with the Moose Hunt.
Both lectures will be illustrated by
stereopticon views. Tickets are now
on sale at the University Book
store and tlje drugstores in Palo
Alto. Prices, 15 and 25 cents for
children, and 50 cents for adults
in the afternoon; admission 35
cents, reserved seats 50 cents, in
the evening.
