The plan of having the Daily
Palo Alto controlled by a stock
company has been discussed con
siderably during the past few days.
The idea is to have one hundred
shares and to sell them to different
students at live dollars apiece.
This will give a fair-sized working
capital. In all probability the
shares would be taken by persons
interested in the welfare of the
Daily, and the best men would be
chosen for editors and business
managers. It often happens that
the man who has spent two or
three years on the paper working
his way up from an assistant to
managing editor is easily defeated
for the office of editor-in-chief by
some more "popular" person who
has been on the paper only a few
months. Under the present sys
tem there is no incentive whatever
for anyone to prepare himself for
business managership, as during
recent years the office has been in
variably given to some popular ath
lete who needed it to pay his ex
penses, and the abilities of candi
dates have not been taken into
consideration. Such a policy as
this has been ruinous to the paper;
and if the Daily is to be a success,
business managers, as well as edi
tors, will have to think of the fu
ture instead of entirely the present.
If the paper were turned over to
one hundred students, they would,
it is reasonable to suppose, be in
terested in its future and would se
lect men for the offices according
to their ability and preparation
and not according to their popu
larity. We hope that the Execu
tive Committee tomorrow evening
will give this matter the fullest
consideration and will present an
amendment to the constitution
along these lines so that the views
of the student body may be ob
tained.
