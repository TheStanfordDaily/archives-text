At several addresses in the As
sembly Hall lately considerable
annoyance has been given the
speakers and audience because of

the disturbance of many late ar
rivals. This was especially marked
at the address of Whitelaw Reid.
Professors as well as students strag
gled in, scraping their feet and
talking, long after the time at
which the address was scheduled
to begin. At times the noise was
so intense that the attention of all
parts of the hall was attracted to
it, and the frowns directed towards
the disturbers could but have as
sured them that they were intrud
ing. Such interruptions must cer
tainly be very disagreeable to a
public speaker who above all else
desires the whole attention of his
hearers, and they are obviously as
odious to the audience. The nui
sance should not be tolerated. We
would suggest a simple and effect
ual remedy: that the doors be
closed when the address begins,
thus excluding all who cannot be
on time.
