# The
						Sports That Make the Man.

### 
Sir Thomas Upton, K. C. V. 0.,
has written especially for The Sat
urday Evening Post, of May 11th,
an article on The Sports that Make
the Man. He places yachting high
on the list, and gives some inter
esting anecdotes of his own career
as an amateur yachtsman.
Sir Thomas is hopeful, if not
confident, of "lifting" the America's
Cup next autumn. He says, how
ever, that if it were a certainty he
would not cross the water; for there
is no sporting interest in "sure
things."
This article will appear exclus
ively in The Saturday Evening
Post, of Philadelphia.
