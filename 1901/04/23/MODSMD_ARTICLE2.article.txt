# Hard Work on Diamond.
## 
### 
Since our almost unexpected vic
tory in the second intercollegiate
baseball game, our men have been
working hard to capture the series.
The second team has been again
called out, and a game between the
two nines is played every night.
The greatest attention is being
paid to hitting and base running,

as our hopes for victory next Sat
urday will depend largely upon
the ability of the nine to play the
"hit and run" game flwhich we
worked to such good advantage in
the last contest.
Jim Lanagan, '00, pitched for
the second eleven last Thursday
and gave the Varsity good practice
in batting against speedy curves.
Dr. Murphy has been loosening up
bis arm, and evens matters be
tween the Varsity and second by
pitching for the latter.
Parker continues in his best form
and will undoubtedly give a good
account of himself Saturday. His
control seems to be improving.
Ball can be depended upon to do
his share at his end of the battery.
The form of our fielders, both in
infield and outfield, gives good rea
son for hope of a Cardinal victory
Saturday.
The Varsity and second teams
are lining up as follows:
VARSITY. SECOND.
Ball ,c Horn
Parker p. . . . Dr. Murphy
Cowden lb Ballagh
Misner 21) Young
Ed wards ss Pollard
C. Murphy 3b Moore
Brown If Lowenthal
Symonds c 112 Tritch
