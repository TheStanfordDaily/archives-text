The farce entitled "(Saved by a
Knocker," written by C. M. Mar
rack, '01, and staged by W. M.
Erb, '01, wan presented before a
fairly large audience in Assembly
Hall Friday evening for the enrich
ment of the Quad and student body
coffers. The piece was lacking in
strongly-centered pint, and depend
ed for interest on take-offs of local
celebrities. Corbohier as "Chap
pie," the chronic knocker; Nangle
and Warren as University regis
trar and assistant; and ISnglish as
"(jeorge Washington Walker,"
elicited generous applause for their
clever work as human caricatures.
