# "The Science of Saintliness."

### 
In the services at the chapel on
Sunday morning, the Rev. Alfred
Bailey of Oakland, choosing for his
subject "The Science of Saintli
ness," delivered an impressive ser
mon on ideals and how through
them lives have been and may still
be led in saintliness.
"Our ideal should stand always
before us, â€”our hearts should reach
for it and at last we should die for
it. Gideon and Sampson were men
just like ourselves, not saints, but
with human passions and weak
nesses. They struggled as we may
struggle; they conquered as we may
conquer.
"Some ideal should take hold of
your life while in college and be
followed earnestly. It is possible
to be an honest lawyer, to he an
upright business man. It is better
to die from lack of bread than to
let your soul die.
"The painter paints bis ideal,
but however wonderful the result
may be, he feels it is only a blot
of what he saw. The musician's
soul feels some beautiful harmony,
while he can only curse his clumsi
ness of hand; lie only gives a hint
of his inner niusic.
"We must see, believe in our
ideal; believe in it when it does not
$hine upon us.
"TheChurch, Christianity, Christ,
stand for the ideal in every walk of
life. 'The gods within lis are
stretching out their hands to the
gods without us.' I am to take
I his ideal of Christ, no matter what
the men about me take; no matter
what I do, 1 am to be that ideal,
L am to die believing in it. J can
not separate myself from myself,
from my early surroundings; my
humble home, my early trials were
an altar stair to climb toward God,
if I had known it. Believe in thy
truest self. There is no failure ex

cept for the man who has lost his
ideal; there is 110 damnation except
when an ideal is shunned; the mo
ment that the longing for an ideal
starts, the soul lives.
"Mozart gave to the world the
Miserere hy going to the cathedral
where it wns played and letting the
music sink into his soul until he
could reproduce it. In the same
way let the Christ ideal sink into
the soul. 1 sit before the cross, not
to mourn because of the blood, but
to remember Christ's love, his loy
alty to truth, and to clasp it to my
soul."
