Don't depend too much on old-fashioned
medical methods. Don't believe every
thing you are told. Lots of people are be

an X-Ray picture taken of your internal
organs, bones, joints, etc. You will then
know the truth. Know exactly where and
what the trouble is. Then your chances
of being cured will be good. For a thor
oughly good, reliable picture, oall at the
Edison College of X-Ray Therapeutics

other diseases. Medical Eleotrology and
Radiology. X-Ray Therapeutist.
If you have a Tumor or Cancer, our X-Ray
