# THREE FOOTBALL COACHES.
## Spaulding, McMillan, and Cotton Will Have Charge of the Players. 
### 
Ever since the appointment of
Dr. Frank Simpson as the bead
coach of the Berkeley football
squad for next season, considerable
interest has been manifested in
the policy to be adopted at Palo
Alto. From the first the selection
of a head coach has been a serious
problem to the football authorities
at Stanford; but just before we go
to press it has been definitely an
nor need that they have settled it
to their own satisfaction and in a
way that they believe promises well
for the future of their football in
terests.
Three of the best of the old grid
iron heroes will return next Sep
tember and remain throughout the
season as coaches. These men
have been chosen not only because
of their prowess as players, but
even more because they have the
qualities which go to make a good
coach. All three of these men are
leaders, possessed of great personal
magnetism, endowed with the in
stinct of the football strategist, and
are thorough gentlemen.
Dr. Alfred Spalding, a graduate
of Stanford in 1896 and of the med
ical department of Columbia Uni
versity in 1900, will devote his at
tention to the ends and tackles.
He played end on the Varsity in
his college days, and has gone
down in the traditions of Stanford
as one of the fastest and cleverest
ends the Cardinal has ever had.
In New York be played the same
position with Columbia and had
the opportunity of keeping abreast
of the modern developments of the
game. He has had the advantage
of long coaching under the Yale
system and an intimate association
with such past masters of the foot
ball art as Walter Camp and San
ford.
George McMillan entered Stan
ford with the class of 1897, and
made the team his first year. He
will return to coach the line men
in all the tricks of the trade he
knew so well. He also had the
greater part of his training under
Yale coaches, such as "Pop'' Bliss
and Will Pringle. Added to this,
he has coached the Multnomah
team for the past two seasons, and
so has a practical knowledge of
what he has to do. As a player,
McMillan was of the whirlwind
order, and although light in weight
he was the best running and de
fensive guard Stanford ever had.
He has also played tackle and half
back for Reliance. Butte, Olympic,
Anaconda, and Multnomah,
Stewart Cotton, '98, will return
from Manila to coach the back-
Held His fame as a player is so
recent that it needs no recapitula
tion. If he can instill into the
present players something of the
spirit that marked his plav during
his last two years as fullback, he
will make Stanford's backs hard to
beat His playing was in the
main under the coaching of Walter
Camp, Cross, and Brooke, so he is
familiar with the systems both of
Yale and Pennsylvania.
Earlier in the year it was hoped

that Home of the older graduates
could he secured as head coach for
the season of 1901. The value of a
head coach for unifying differences
among the under-coaches, as a
court of last resort in question of
policy, etc., has been recognized.
Generally, however, the older men
fitted for such a position, men like
Whitehouse, Wilbur, and others,
have been at such a distance and
so confined by their business in
terests that they could not accept
the position. The position was
tendered to Prof. Jack E. Reynolds
of the Law department, but for
many reasons which must be ap
parent, he felt that circumstances
might arise from time to time that
would make the dual role of in
structor and coach a source of em
barrassment and place him in an
inconsistent position. Since the
difficulty of securing a head-coach
has become serious, and since the
necessity of having some one
to maintain a coherent system
throughout the season has become
so apparent, Professor Reynolds
has consented to act in the capac
ity of faculty-adviser to the coaches.
The lot has fallen to him because of
the fact that he is on the ground,
where he can give matters his per
sonal attention, and as a student
and a member of the faculty has
been interested in athletic affairs.
