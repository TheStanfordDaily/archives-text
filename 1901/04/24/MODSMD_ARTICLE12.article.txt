Now that the field-day is over it
might not be unwise to ask the
reason for our defeat. This much is
apparent to everyone: the wearers
of the Cardinal were inferior to
none in courage. They fought a
hard fight until they dropped, and,
if nerve alone could win the day,
victory would have been ours. But
there is another factor to be con
sidered. A few weeks' training
can never take the place of months
of hard, steady work. Nearly every
wearer of a Blue and Gold track
shirt stepped on the cinders in
splendid condition. The Berkeley
men began work early last fall and
kept conscientiously at it. So they
were confident and high spirited
when they got on the mark, and at
the end of a gruelling race they were
still fresh. No Stanford man fin
ished in any of the distances but
the walk who was not in a condi
tion of physical collapse. Our ath
letes simply were under-trained.
Next fall let every athlete get
out and work. Let him sign rules
to keep in light training. Then
let him keep them. No man who
will not deny himself for the sake
of his college has any right to be
on the team. Next spring the
meet will be held here; the Berkeley
men will have the worry of the trip,
will be annoyed by a strange track,
and will, if we work, be beaten.
Moreover, we shall probably have
by that time a trainer who can
give his entire attention to track
work. With these things in our
favor we should be able to make
the next intercollegiate field-day
the first one ever won by Stanford.
