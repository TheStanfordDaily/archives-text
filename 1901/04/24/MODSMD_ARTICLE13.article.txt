# The 						"Occident" on the Game.
## 
### 
The following interesting reflec
tion apropos of the recent inter
collegiate baseball game was clipped
from last Friday's U. C. Occident:

"Truly, last Saturday's game
was a balloon ascension for the
whole team. Hardly one man
kept his feet on the ground, and
consequently nearly every ball was
juggled about four times. Even
the scorer made errors, for he was
unable to take all the chances that
came his way. He credits us with
thirteen errors when there must
have been twenty-three at least.
Stanford made three errors and
seven hits, while we made eight
hits. Five Stanford men struck
out, while every California man
hit the ball somehow. It is thus
clear that it was only through our
miserable fielding that we lost Sat
urday's game.
"If a strange field has anything
to do with a team's playing, then
surely there is some explanation of
the demoralization of our men, for
a stranger field than that down at
Stanford is seldom seen. A dia
mond placed within a narrow
track, with right field entirely cut
off by a fence, thus bunching the
three out-fielders, must have a pe
culiar effect upon a team. It did.
Not that it is wholly to blame, but
it contributed to the general 'going
up-in-the-air.' It is certainly un
worthy of such an institution as
Stanford to ask her visitors to play
on such a field; and if she ever asks
again, the visitors should refuse."
