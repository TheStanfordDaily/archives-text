Within the last few months the
development of oil in the Sunset oil
district has progressed by leaps and
bounds until section 22, township
11 north, range 24 west, is sur
rounded by hundreds of tine wells,
some flowing. Also the above
ground is within one and a half
miles of the famous Jewett and
Blodgett wells and refinery, and
the railroads have contracted to
deliver oil from railroad to sea
board for thirty-two cents per bar
rel. The survey is completed and
the contract for grading has been
let, and graders are on the ground
rushing the work.
The Sunset being the best devel
oped and most productive of all
oil fields, the above section being
located in the center of the same,
and the Sunset-Vortex Oil Com
pany owning 240 acres in this sec
tion, makes the stock of the Sun
set-Vortex Company sure of ad
vancing in the near future to a
very high figure. The company
bought this land some time ago
at a very low figure, and has held
it, until now it has been proven that
if they put down a hole they are
sure to get a good well. They now
offer a limited amount of stock for
development of well number one at
the exceedingly low price of twenty
cents per share, stock absolutely
non-assessa hie.
This is a chance to get in on the
ground floor. For further informa
tion or stock, call or write to office.
