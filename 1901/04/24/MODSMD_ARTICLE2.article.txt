# Alumni Football Team.
## 
### 
A movement is on foot in San
Francisco for the formation of an
alumni football eleven to furnish
practice games for the university
teams next fall. The team is to be
formed of graduate players from
both Stanford and California, and
is to arrange a schedule of games
with both colleges. If the plan
succeeds the team will probably
play under the colors of the Olym
pic Club.
