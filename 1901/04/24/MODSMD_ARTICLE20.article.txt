# SETON-THOMPSON'S LECTURES.
## Large Audience Greeted the Famous Naturalist Yesterday Afternoon and Evening. 
### 
Ernest Seton-Thompson ad
dressed two large audiences yester
day. His first lecture was deliv
ered at the Methodist Church, Palo
Alto, yesterday afternoon. He
talked on the "Personality of Wild
Animals," telling stories about
Lobo, the grizzly bears, Little
Johnny, and many others of the
children's favorites. About two
hundred children listened in rapt
attention, and went away charmed
with the man who had lived all his
life among animals, and knew all
their little personal traits and pe
culiarities.
About six hundred people list
ened to Mr. Thompson's lecture in
the Assembly Hall last evening on
"Wild Animals 1 Have Known."
This lecture, as well as the one in
the afternoon, was illustrated by
stereopticon views, which added
greatly to its force and vividness.
Mr. Seton-Thompson's manner
on the platform is one of the great
est simplicity and ease. He lec
tured without notes and illustrated
all his stories by animal drawings
made by himself or his wife. He
said in part:
"My storie√ü are all true. I could
not invent them if I tried. In tell
ing or writing a story 1 take an
actual individual animal as a basis
and add to its life-history the ex
ploits of other animals, which have
been actually witnessed or inferred
from observation. Thus ray inci
dents are all true, though some of
my characters are fictitious."
He then proceeded to tell the
stories of "llaggyling" and "Molly
Cottontail," of "The Yaller Dog,"
and the "Pacing Mustang." He
also recounted stories of his dog
Hanger's abilities, and of experi
ences with many other pets. He
thrilled his audience with the ex
citing story of a red-deer hunt in
Switzerland, and finally wound up
with a moose hunt in Canada, in
which the moose was finally caught
by an imitation of the call of the
lovesick cow-moose. He also gave
several accurate imitations of the
calls and cries of the birds and
beasts, with whom he was so fa
miliar.
Everyone who heard Mr. Thomp
son was pleased with his attractive
personality and well-told, fasci
nating stories and pictures.
