# BASEBALL.
## Men Show Considerable Improvement. Ball returns to Practice. 
### 
If the form which onr baseball
team has shown in the spirited
practices'of the last two weeks, is a
criterion, the Cardinal will play a
good game Saturday and will com
pel the Blue and Gold team to put
forth its best game if it is to win.
The greatest improvement which
our team has made recently is in
playing together and putting life
into the game. The fielding con
tinues good, but the batting has
not come up to the standard.
The absence of Ball from the last
few practices has hampered the
team considerably, but he has now
almost entirely recovered from his
recent illness and it is expected
that he will be back in his old
form before Saturday. If Ball is
unable to don the mit, Horn, who
has been catching and throwing in
good style, will fill the position be
hind the plate. Ball's loss would,
however, be almost irreparable, as
he is one of the most consistent
players on the team and can al
ways be relied upon to do his share
in winning a game.
The result of the game Saturday
will depend to a considerable ex
tent upon the pitching of Parker.
If he can control his speed and
curves as well as in the last game,
Berkeley's end of the score will be
very small. In practice Parker is
showing up well. His arm is in
good shape and he fields his posi
tion perfectly. He has also been
hitting the ball squarely, and may
do some good work with the stick.
Murphy is becoming more and
more accustomed to his new posi
tion at the third corner and is
playing fast ball. His base run
ning is the best on the team, and
he will undoubtedly keep the arms
of the Berkeley players busy trying
to flag them on the bags.
Cowden is playing his usual fast
game at first base and is still bat
ting up to his mark.
Great things are expected of Sy
monds. With a perfect outfield,
he should repeat his performance
in the last game, when he took
seven chances without an error,
some of which would have been
hits even in a professional league
game. Symonds is one of the fast
est fielders that we have ever had,
and he is sure, as can be seen from
the fact that he has only missed
one ball this season. Symond's
base running also will doubtless be
a feature of the game Saturday.
Bennett will again be seen in
right field and will be alternate
pitcher. While he does not cover
as much ground as our other field
ers, he is sure, and easily the most
reliable man for the position. If
Bennett's services are required in
the box, Lowenthal will probably
take his place in the field.
The team will leave for San
Francisco on the 7:58 train tomor
row morning, and may practice at
Recreation Park after the league
game is over
The Berkeley-Stanford game will
be played at Recreation Park,
Eighth and Harrison streets, Sat
urday at 10:30 o'clock. An attempt

is being made to have the 9:44
train on that morning tstop at
Eighth street, and if successful the
game will not be called until after
this train arrives.
The line-up will be as follows:
STANFORD. BERKELEY.

Parker p Overall
Cowden lb Gardner
Misner 2b King
Murphy 3b Braley
