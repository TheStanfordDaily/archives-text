Not only will the game next
Saturday decide the baseball series
for this season, but it will deter
mine which university will have
more intercollegiate victories to its
credit for the academic year of
1900-1901. The student body re
lies upon our nine to win for us.
Every member of the team should
feel the individual responsibility
resting upon him. Stanford won
both the Freshman and Thanks
giving football games last semester
and the Carnot debate this semes
ter; California defeated us in the
tiiree events of last Saturday. If
our baseball men play the game,
individually and as a team, of
which they are capable, we
should be confident of the result.
Let the students lend their moral
support by attendance at the game
in Recreation Park, San Francisco,
Saturday morning.
