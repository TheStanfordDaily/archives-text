We receive from time to time
through the postoffice sundry news
items and communications without
the authors' names. Such news
as this is unreliable and cannot be
published, for the editor must know
who is responsible for everything
that appears in the paper. One of
the San Francisco dailies got itself
into troublesome three years ago by
publishing a poem sent to it. The
first letter of the lines made up a
vulgar expression which the editor
did not notice until after the issue
containing it was published.
Agents for the paper were kept
busy for some time buying up and
destroying copies of that issue.
Such an affair as this is not likely
to happen to the college daily, but
still it is a fact that every one con
siders it a great joke to get some
thing into a paper which should
not be there. We shall have to
ask every one who has anything
for the Daily Palo Alto to sign
his or her name, not for publica
tion, but so that we may know
who is responsible for it.
