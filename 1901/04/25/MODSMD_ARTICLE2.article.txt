# Football Meeting.
## 
### 
About thirty men responded last
evening to the call issued by Cap
tain Fisher for a meeting of all the
football men who were on the field
last year. The meeting primarily
was to announce to the men the
new system of graduate coaching
and to inform them of the choice of
coaches for the coming year. Pro
fessor Reynolds told the men of
the difficulty the football author
ities had met in endeavoring to se
lect a head coach, and how that
difficulty had been solved by the
selection of Spalding, McMillan,
and Cotton to act on an equal foot
ing, each to have charge of separate
groups of men.
