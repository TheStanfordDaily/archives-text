# OLD SYSTEM RETAINED.
## Inter-Society Debating League Expresses Disapproval of Class Organizations. 
### 
A meeting of the Inter-Society
Debating League was held last
night for the purpose of deciding
upon the advisability of changing
the present system of debating so
cieties to that of class organiza
tions. About forty persons were
present, representing the different
societies. President English of
Philolexian presided.
Under the proposed system, each
class as it enters would form a de
bating society, which would con
tinue throughout the four years.
This method is at present in vogue
at Harvard University. The suc
cess of the present Freshman so
ciety was advanced as an argument
for the change, but Freshman de
baters present held that their or
ganization has not been a success,
as but eight or ten out of thirty
live members have attended reg
ularly, and meetings have been
few. It was suggested that under
the class system men could be
called into regular society work
earlier and greater loyalty both to
society and class be engendered.
The general feeling of those pres
ent seemed to be against the
change. The present sympathy
between members would be broken
up and the advantage younger
members derive from upper-class
men would be destroyed. As for
the system at Harvard, it is no im
provement over the Stanford sys
tem. As the existing societies have
developed very good debaters, they
must be termed a success, with a
change unnecessary. A motion to
abandon the proposed change and
to continue the present system was
carried by a good majority.
It was also suggested that the
Freshman-Sophomore debate be
held the latter part of the first
semester instead of in April. This
would allow the Freshmen to enter
the other societies sooner and to
get regularly settled down to work,
since they are not allowed to join
the regular societies until after the
inter-class contest.
The election of officers of the
League was postponed until the next
meeting.
