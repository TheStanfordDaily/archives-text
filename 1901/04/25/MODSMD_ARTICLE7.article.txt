# Gymnasium Club.
## 
### 
The Gymnasium Club held a
preliminary rehearsal last night of
the program which will be followed
in the exhibition "at home" next
Wednesday night. The evening
will be devoted to class work and
individual exercises. The class
work will consist of mat work,
such as monkey rolls, cartwheels,
kangaroo walks, and tumbling,
and of pyramid building, both
knee and shoulder mounts. The
individual work will be upon the

several pieces of apparatus. Each
member of the club has been as
signed to that work for which he
is most suited through ability or
inclination, so that at each piece
of apparatus there will be three or
four men who are expected to per
form three tricks apiece upon it.
Although competition among the
members is not forbidden, it willN
not be general; so comparisons will
be few and unimportant. But the
variety of stunts will be much
larger, and should be as highly
appreciated as where the same
trick is done by several gymnasts.
Invitations will be given only to
those directly concerned with the
University.
