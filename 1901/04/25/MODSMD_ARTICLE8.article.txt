# Main Pipe Laid.
## 
### 
The eight-inch pipe line for the
new water works was completed up
to the tank yesterday. A smaller
surface pipe of two inches in diam
eter will be laid shortly, its object
being to convey water to mix the
cement used to line the reservoir.
There will be but one main line
laid, the water being pumped up to
the tank through this and all sup
ply-pipes being connected with it.
Thus the water will be used direct
from the pumps when they are
working and from the tank when
the engines are at rest. It was not
known at first whether or not this
plan of using a single pipe would
work, but experts have now agreed
that it is feasible. A fourteen-inch
sewer line extends from the lake to
the valley beyond, to be used in
cleaning the big tank. The set
tling tank at the pumping station
has been fully completed, and the
whole plant will soon be in work
ing order. James Creighton of the
Pacific Improvement Company of
San Francisco has charge of the
work.
