# FACULTY ON ROSS AFFAIR.
## Professors Prepare a Statement Upholding the Action of the University Authorities. 
### 
Applications to instructors at
Stanford University for some state
ment of the views of those who were
in a better position than outsiders
to judge of the resignation of Pro
fessor Koss have been so numerous
that it was thought fit to make a
brief statement in a form conven
ient to send to friends of the Uni
versity.
To this end the following was
prepared. It is unofficial and was
submitted, with full opportunity to
examine the evidence, to the pro
fessors and associate professors in
the University for signature.
Of the fifty-three having the rank
of professors or associate professors,
five have been absent on leave dur
ing the current year, and of the re
maining forty-eight now in the Uni
versity, thirty-seven have signed.
Of those whose names do not ap
pear, some are in substantial ac
cord, but for particular reasons do
not wish to sign. Others differ on
more or less essential points from
the statement as formulated.
To the Friends of Stanford Univer
sity :
The undersigned, members of the
University Council (professors and
associate professors) of the Leland
Stanford Junior University, in view
of the numerous publications fol
lowing upon the resignation of Pro
fessor Ross, which reflect on the Uni
versity and its founder, and on our
connection with it, deem it wise to
issue the following statement.
In doing this we do not impeach
the good faith of those who have
interested themselves in this mat
ter because of the question of Uni
versity policy involved, but we wish
to affirm our confidence in the Uni
versity, its Founder, and its Presi
dent. We have examined all
records, letters, and copies of letters
in the possession of the University
bearing upon this case, and are
greed:â€”
(1) That in the dismissal of Pro
fessor Ross no question of aca
demic freedom was involved;
(2) That in the dismissal of
Professor Ross, President Jordan
wan justified.
