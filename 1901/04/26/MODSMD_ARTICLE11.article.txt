### 
The challenge received by Track-
Captain Henley of the Freshman
Class several days ago from the
University of Nevada, asking for
a track meet on May 4th at Reno
with theathletesof theClass of 19U4,
is in a fair way to he accepted.
About a dozen men have already
signified their willingness to go,
while several who are temporarily
indisposed will doubtless be in con
dition by the first of May. Among
this number are Dunn, who is suf
fering from an abcess on his right
knee; Lamb, who is laid up with
the measles; Sprague, who has a
severe cold; and Henley, whose leg
was strained in the contest last
Saturday. The events will doubt
less be the same as those in the
field-day with Oakland High
School. The Freshman team will
probably include Bubb, Lamb, and
H. L. Hamilton for sprints, North,
Beebe, and Taylor to take the
hurdles, and Dunn, Patterson,
and Hoi man on the quarter
mile and half. Sprague, Thomas,
Lewis, and Van Norden will look
after the mile and two-mile runs.
Hyde, McFadden, and Nichols will
handle the weights, and Henley
and Preston will win points for
their class in the jumps.
