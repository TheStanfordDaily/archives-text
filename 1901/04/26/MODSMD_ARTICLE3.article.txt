# Mix-up on the Quad.
## 
### 
As the result of an article which
appears in this week's Chaparral,
the editor of that paper and the
newly elected president of the stu
dent body shared in quite a mix
up on the quad this morning. The
article that made the trouble was
a severe castigation of the president
elect, and he proceed to call the
editor to account while the latter
was vending his paper on the quad.
It looked for a minute as if there
would be an interesting fracas, but
several students parted the com
batants before they came to serious
blows.
