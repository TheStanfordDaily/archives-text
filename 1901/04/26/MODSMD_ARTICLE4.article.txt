# 1902 "QUAD."
## A 						Volume of Unique Features is the Forthcoming Junior Annual. 
### 
The Junior Annual is to be
placed on sale the morning of May
Bth. All the editorial work has
been completed, and the press-work
is being finished as quickly as pos
sible by the Stanley-Taylor Com
pany. The book is to present
many new features. The editors
have planned to make it an anni
versary number commemorating
the completion of the first ten years
of the University's life. To pre
sent something of the conditions
in 1891, and those of 1901, Dr.
Jordan has written an article, "The
Ideal of Stanfordâ€”Ten Years Af
ter"; Dr. Elliott briefly sketches
the history of the University in its
first decade, and Chas. E. Hodges
has written on "The Growth of the
Quadrangle." The latter article
is especially interesting, giving
briefly something of the immense
amount of work which has been
done here since October 1891, and
sketching for the first time St. Gau
dens' story of the march of civili
zation, now being worked out on
the frieze. A photograph of the
frieze, by A. O. Austin, adds a
great deal to the value of the ar
ticle.
The book will contain more
photographs than any other Stan
ford annual. The plan of having
individual pictures of the Juniors
has worked out most successfully,
and is far superior to that, of the
old-time group picture. There
are one hundred and sixty mem
bers whose pictures appear in this
book. These are arranged on ten
pages, giving an opportunity for
good-sized pictures. All the fra
ternities, with but one exception,
have group pictures, as in the 1900
Annual. In addition to the ath
letic teams, which always have a
place, there are individual photo
graphs of the 1900 tennis team, a
group picture of the athletic cap
tains of 1900-01, of the cross
country team, views of the field
day at Stanford last year, taken by
R. E. Warfield, '03, snap-shots of
the Faculty-Senior game by Miss
Schoenheit, '02, views of the Fresh
man game in San Francisco, and
of the Thanksgiving game. Be
side these there is a group picture
of the cast which presented the
French play last year, a full page
of scenes from the Junior farce,
"Driven Back to Egypt," and the
pictures of societies which always
appear.
The athletic review has been
written by Jack Reynolds; the de
bating review of the last year by
J. F. English; and "How the Stan
ford Amendment Was Won," by
Charles Lewers.
The literary department will be
especially strong this year. For
the first time since the '99 Annual,
when Bristow Adams won the
prize, has a poem been submitted
which was worthy of being award
ed this honor. Ralph E. Renaud's
double ballad, "The Loveless,"
won the prize this year, and is
given first place in the literary de
partment. Charles A. Whitmore's
story, "Through the Medium of the
Press," is a good college story, and
is well illustrated by Renavd. In
addition there is a clever little so
ciety sketch by Miss Perrin, and a
few poems by the best writers in
the University. The department
is not so long as in previous years,
the editor preferring to publish
only the strongest work submitted.
In the Josh department a great
many new ideas have been incor
porated.
The book is to be handsomely
bound in red cloth, with a cover
design of the quad by R. J. Sterrett.
