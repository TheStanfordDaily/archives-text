# CALIFORNIA 9, STANFORD 5.
## Final Game of Intercollegiate Series Goes to Berkeley in an Exciting and Well-Played Contest. 
### 
In a gale of cold wind which
stirred up a continuous cloud of
dust, the baseball teams of Stan
ford and Berkeley played nine in
nings of good, hard ball at Recre
ation Park Saturday in a game
which decided the championship
of 1901. The game was easily the
best of the series in almost every
respect, but was unfortunately
marred by a great deal of unsports
manlike conduct on the part of the
Berkeley base-runners. On at
least four occasions their action
was absolutely inexcusable and
savored of "muckerism" in its
worst form. Hunter ran his spikes
into Edward's thigh when the play
was not even close; McKeown
shouldered Cowden at first base
after he had been* fielded out by
over five feet; Ball was knocked
over at the plate without any ex
cuse; and Adams invariably tried
to block our base-runners as they
passed him while stealing second.
It would be wrong to say that
without this dirty work Berkeley
would not have won, but this by
no means excuses their actions.
Acts which professional ball play
ers consider "dirty" should not be
indulged in by college men.
With the exception of these un
pleasant incidents, the game was
exciting and interesting, and the
play was at times brilliant. The
work of Overall, who toed the slab
for U. C., was largely responsible
for Berkeley's victory, thirteen
Stanford batsmen taking three
innings in vain. If there is any
thing like luck in baseball, our op
ponents were laden with it. Nearly
every time our side was retired
there were from one to three em
bryo runs on the bags. In base
running and fielding our men were
at considerable advantage, but
these qualities were not suflioient
to equal the superiority in hitting
which California showed.
The best individual work of the
day was that of Chester Murphy
at third base. He played the fast
est ball that has been seen on the
third corner for several years in
intercollegiate baseball, and his
performance entitles him to be con
sidered one of the fastest third-base
men on the Coast. His base
running was also easily the best of
the game. He stole second and
third indiscriminately every time
he got on first base and was never
flagged once.
Ball caught a plucky game. In
the sixth inning his finger was
badly shattered, and although it
was constantly bleeding, he gamely
caught till the end. Symonds,
Brown, and Cowden did good work
in fielding. Cowden led the team
also in hitting, getting three safe
ties out of three times at bat, and
he covered first without an error.
The game opened well for Stan
ford by Murphy's walk and his
stealing second and third. The
bags were then filled by two more
passes, but three men fanned before
any score resulted.
Berkeley scored a run in the first
on Misner's failure to cover second

when Barker threw to catch the
runner off the base. In the second
Berkeley scored again on two hits
and a base on balls.
Neither side scored again until
the fifth inning. Murphy took
first by being hit with the ball,
stole second, and scored on Cow
den's hit, Symonds followed with a
hit, stole second, and both he and
Cowden scored on Ball's two bag
ger. Score 3-2 in favor of Stan
ford.
Each side scored one run in the
sixth, Murphy crossing the plate
for Stanford and Hunter for Berke
ley.
Then came the disastrous sev
enth inning in which Stanford lost
the game. Berkeley bunched her
hits in this inning, and aided by a
little bad playing on our part suc
ceeded in bringing five men home,
making the score 8 to 4 in their
favor.
Stanford tried hard to bring up
its end of the score during the re
mainder of the game, but was only
able to add one tally, while Ber
keley also added one, making the
final score 9-5.
For California, Overall and Smith
did most of the work, the other
fielders getting very few chances.
Smith as usual played a hard,
clean game, and was at no time
guilty of any of the yellow tactics
of his team-mates. The score:
