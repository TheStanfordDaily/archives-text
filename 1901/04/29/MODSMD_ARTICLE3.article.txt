# "TRUSTS."
## Professor Miller Delivered the First of His Series of Lectures This Afternoon. 
### 
The first of the series of lectures
on Trusts by Prof. A. C. Miller of
the University of Chicago was de
livered this afternoon in the chapel
before a fair-sized audience. Pro
fessor Miller speakes clearly, force
fully, and in a most convincing
manner. He said in part:
"The trust question is a debatable
question, with much to be said on
both sides. I will confine myself
to the economic issues of the
problem. Test the trust by the
advantages of organization, and
then consider the side of the public.
The trust touches the social life at
four points: the investor, the work
man, the consumer, and the com
petitor. As consumption is the
final end of all productions, the
consumer is the most important of
these. We must test the trust by
social efficiency: whether it is a
more economical form than any
other form we have had. Official
and private investigation is doing
much to clear up many difficult
points.
"Trusts are not peculiarly Amer
ican, although they originated here.
They are almost as marked in Ger
many as in the United States.
Probably this is because German
industrial development has been
similar to ours. The capitaliza
tion of the trusts in this country
has doubtless passed the ten bil
lion mark, but such combina
tions are usually over-capital
ized, and the actual assets are prob
ably 30% to 40% of the nominal
capital. The true causes of trusts
are the intolerable evil of unregu
lated and unscrupulous competi
tions, and the advantage of central
ization. The subordinate influ
ences are, first, accidental or artifi
cial; second, financial; third, indus
trial or natural. The chief artificial
influences are discrimination of
railroad rates and tariff legislation.
The first has been especially evil
in its effects; the latter has fostered
trusts of some kinds.
"Trusts are the dominant
industrial motive of the age.
They are a result of com
bination in business, and an at
tempt to get rid of competition.
The tendency of modern industry
is to diminish the number of com
petitors and to increase the fierce
ness of competition. Accordingly
combination is neccessary as compe
tition becomes fiercer and as the
prize, monopoly, grows nearer."
