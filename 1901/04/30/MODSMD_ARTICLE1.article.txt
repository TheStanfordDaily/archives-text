# PROFESSOR OF HISTORY.
## Dr. Max Farrand of Wesleyan Accepts a Chair at Stanford.—To Lecture Next Week. 
### 
The first Princeton graduate to
secure a place on the Stanford fac
ulty is Dr. Max Farrand, now pro
fessor in Wesleyan University of
Middleton, Connecticut, whose ap
pointment to a professorship in
History has just been announced
as the first step toward the reor
ganization of that department.
Professor Farrand will visit the
University on May 7th and will de
liver a course of three lectures on
the "Territorial Development of
the United States." The lectures
will be under the auspices of the
Department of History and will be
given in the chapel at an hour to
be announced later.
Dr. Farrand is a comparatively
young man, having received his
Princeton bachelor's degree in 1892
and his A. M.in 1893. During
1892-93 he held the Bodinot fellow
ship in history at his alma mater,
and the next year won a fellowship
in social science at the same insti
tution. In 1894 he went abroad
for study, spending a year each at
the Universities of Leipsig and
Heidelberg. Returning in 1896,
he was for two years instructor in
history at Wesleyan, being pro
moted to an associate professorship
in 1898. Since 1899 he has held
the Hedding professorship. He is
a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
As a contributor to historical lit
erature, Dr. Farrand has done
some substantial work. He has
written a treatise on the legisla
tion of Congress for the govern
ment of the organized territories of
the United States, 1786-1895, and
is the author of articles in the
American Historical Review as fol
lows: January, 1898, "The Taxa
tion of Tea, 1767-1773"; July, 1898,
"The Delaware Bill of Rights of
1776"; July, 1900, "The Judiciary
Act of 1801," and "Territory and
District." Henry Holt and Com
pany of New York have in press a
translation by Dr. Farrand of Jel
linek's "Declaration of the Rights
of Men and of Citizens."
The American Historical Review
of April, 1901, makes the following
announcement: "Professor Max
Farrand of Wesleyan University
has undertaken the preparation of
a work certain to be highly useful
to all students of our constitutional
history—a critical edition of all
the acts of the Philadelphia Con
vention of 1787, embracing both the
official journal and all the rnoffi
cial notes of debates, so arranged as
to permit ready reference at once to
all the records of any given day,
and properly supplied with schol
arly annotations."
