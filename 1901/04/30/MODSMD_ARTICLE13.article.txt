The announcement made today
that the second eleven football
players will be given a trip to
Salt Lake City next fall should
meet with universal approval. The
men who devote their energies to
the student body without receiving
anything in return and knowing
that they have scanty chances of
making the Varsity, will this year
be given due recognition for their
services.
