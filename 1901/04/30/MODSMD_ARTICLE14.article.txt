The Gymnasium Club promises
an interesting program tomorrow
evening at its entertainment. The
twenty or so active members of the
club have shown considerable in
terest in the progress and work of
the organization, which has opened
to them opportunities for advanced
training and skill in gymnastic
exercises otherwise impossible.
This chance of progress is a great
advantage to many men who are
hampered in learning new and
more difiicult tricks in the regular
Gymnasium work, in that they
must spend most of their time in
teaching what they already know
to others. The club, therefore,
should be n permanent organiza
tion, and act as a sort of graduate
school for enthusiastic gymnasts.
The advantages of the club for
better training will doubtless be
apparent at the exhibition tomor
row night, which is the outcome of
the work of the semester.
