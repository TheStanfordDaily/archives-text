# "THE VICTORY OF JOB."
## Rev. Edward L. Parsons Delivers the Sunday Morning Address in the Chapel. 
### 
"The righteous alsojshall hold on
hits way, and lie that hath clean
hands shall he stronger and
stronger." (Job xvii, 9.)
"This," said the Rev. Edward L.
Parsons, "if I were delivering a
formal sermon, would he my text
These are the finest words in Job;
finest from their meaning. They
speak about the victory of Job.
The entire book has a fascination
for men because of its problem of
sin and suffering, the practical so
lution of the problem, and Job's
victory over the world.
"What was the nature of that
victory? His friends in the time
of prosperity would ask: 'But
does Job fear God for naught? Is
there not in his service some de
sire for reward?' They are labor
ing with the traditional belief that
righteousness deserves prosperity,
that wherever there is suffering
there is evidence of evil. When
his property has been taken and
his body wracked by disease, Job
can not understand God's action,
for he knows that he has been
righteous and that he can not un
der any circumstances have de
served the fate which has come
upon him. He meets the personal
attacks of friends who have in
ferred his unrighteousness. It
would be presumptuous in the
light of traditional belief to ques
tion; he dares not ask God for the
explanation of the whole matter.
He feels himself powerless; even if
he should question, God would
make his very mouth condemn
him —still he feels he must ques
tion. He throws his defiance in
the face of God; he dares not give
up the problem that is working
itself out in his soul —he sees the
righteousness of questioning and
he questions God's justice.
"How can he present bis cause?
He finds that righteousness is
something beyond mere brute force.
He has no wealth, friends, health,
prosperity, nor even a well-bal
anced mind; in righteousness alone
he can appear before God.
"Righteousness has its answer in
the world about us. There is an
inevitable tendency that it shall go
on increasing in power and mean
ing, that in the end there shall be a
vindication of righteousness. Job
feels confident that his vindicator,
God, lives, that in righteousness a
man shall stand forever. He has
an inborn faith that righteousness
belongs to the reality of things.
" Fromt he thought that righteous
ness is greater than might he works
on to the belief that righteousness
works itself out in the world. Then
comes the revelation to him of
the inadequacy of the little
standards by which he judged
things. He begins to see the great
ness c.f nature. As the result of
the struggle with his soul conies
the vision of God, that righteous
ness was the one thing on which
be could build his life, that right
eousness belonged to the world of
real things. This then is the vic
tory of righteousness over all that
fortune can bring."
