# TRUSTS AS BENEFACTORS.
## They Mark Progress in Commercial Methods, Says Professor Miller. Third Lecture Tomorrow. 
### 
Professor Miller was greeted this
afternoon by a large audience
which listened closely to his con
vincing line of arguments and
facts. He said:
"Competition causes combina
tions, which strive for monopoly.
The strength of the trust lies in its
economy of industrial energy: first,
by doing away with competition;
second, by producing economically.
There is much talk about applying
business methods to city govern
ment. Tammany is doubtless bet
ter managed than most business, by
avoiding needless expenses. The
trust means first and foremost
the saving of needless expense and
the economy of productive power.
Trusts exploit inventions and take
advantage of new processes better
than small plants can. Eternal
vigilance is the price of monopoly.
"Trusts develop exports and are
benefited by internationalizing of
trade. Trade follows not the flag,
but the trust; which is more pow
erful than diplomacy. Of the Unit
ed States exports, eighty per cent,
are trust products. The recent
period of rapidly expanding ex
port trade has come at the same
time as our rapidly expanding for
eign trade.
"Large combinations remove con
ditions causing crises. Crises come
from lack of adjustment between
consumption and production. Com
petition causes the modern produc
tive system to be relatively plan
less, by a misdirection of efforts, by
a working apart instead of together.
The trust may not be a perfect
plan, but it is a marked advance
over the present system. It pro
ceeds with some reference to the
needs of the market.
"Large organizations develop the
ablest industrial leaders, entre
preneurs. They enable the best
men to use their abilities in large
enterprises instead of small, and to
concentrate the forces. All our
great captains of industry are the
product of the competitive system.
Will trusts develop men able to
keep the trusts in power?
"Trusts promise much good, and
society, therfore, will not renounce
them."
Tomorrow's lecture will be "The
case of the people against the
Trusts."
