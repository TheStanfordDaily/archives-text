# NEW UNIVERSITY REGISTER.
## Records Promotions in Faculty Ranks and Changes in Admission Requirements. 
### 
The University Register for 1900-
01 will be ready for distribution
about May Bth. There are the
usual variations incident to a new
printer, and the usual shifting and
readjustment of courses, but no
startling changes in comparison
with Registers of former years.
Comparing with the Register for
1899-1900, the following promo
tions are noted:
To be Associate Professors: As
sistant Professors Peirce, Stearns,
and Johnston.
To be Assistant Professor: In
structor Blichfeldt.
To be Instructors: Assistants
Maddock, Muckleston, and Snod
grass.
The new men (above the rank of
Assistant) are: Assistant Professors
Curran and Lapsley, and Instruc
tors Bartlett, Seward, Rettger, War
ren, and Neidig.
New appointments to take effect
September Ist, are: Assistant Pro
fessors Ramsey, E. P. Anderson,
and Rieber; Instructors Bassett and
Snedden.
The most significant changes are
noted under "Admission" Require
ments. Heretofore the University
has given three credits only
in • English, although the sub
ject presupposes four years' work
and although four credits are given
at California, Michigan, and some
other universities. Four credits
will be given hereafter at Stanford,
the extra credit being allotted to
English Composition; but this ex
tra credit will be given only to
those who offer fifteen credits for
entrance. In the Register for
1899-1900, general reference was
made to the possibility of obtain
ing entrance credit in Manual
Training and some other subjects
not included in the regular entrance
list. The subjects there had in
mind have now been formally
listed, and are as follows: Biology
(one credit), Physiography (one
credit), Mechanical Drawing (one
half credit), Wood-working (one
half credit), Forge-work (one-half
credit), Foundry-work (one-half
credit), Machine shop (one credit).
It will be noticed also that here
after Elementary Algebra will
count one and a half credits instead
of two credits as heretofore. The
other half credit has been trans
ferred to Advanced Algebra, which
is now divided into three parts,
each part counting one-half credit.
The first part is the usual Ad
vanced Algebra given in the schools
and corresponds to Advanced Al
gebra, part I, of the University of
California requirements. Parts II
and 111, now at present given in the
schools, correspond exactly to the
lij'st course in Algebra in the De
partment of Mathmatics.
At present entrance examinations
are offered in all subjects three
times during the year. Hereafter
in order to take entrance examina
tions in January and May (not
applying in May, 1901) applicants
must give formal notice ten days
in advance, and if not students of
the University must have their

applications endorsed by their
teachers. For the present, formal
examinations are not to be set in
tiie new subjects (numbered 23 and
29), but special arrangements may
be made for the third and fourth
examination days.
Some changes are noted under
Admission on Recommendation.
Candidates fulfilling all require
ments for admission in full stand
ing to Bryn Mawr, California
(Groups 1 or II), Chicago, Co
lumbia, Cornell (A. B. course),
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Michi
gan, Smith, Vassar, Wellesley, or
Yale, will be admitted to full un
dergraduate standing without fur
ther tests. Candidates may also
take the regular entrance examina
tions of any one of these institu
tions, and also those given by the
College Entrance Examination
Hoard of the Middle States and
Maryland, in place of the Stan
ford examinations. The most in
teresting experiment now being
tried in connection with the rela
tions of universities and secondary
schools is that of the College En
trance Examination Board of the
Middle States and Maryland. It
is hoped in time that all the lead
ing universities will be included,
and that all entrance examina
tions at the University may be
superseded by the examinations of
this central board, in which all the
universities shall co-operate.
In Chemistry, it will be noted
that although the requirements
have not been changed, hereafter
notebooks need not be formally
shown to the Department. In or
der to be admitted to advanced
courses in Chemistry, however, it
will be necessary to pass the regu
lar entrance examination at the
University.
Under Advanced Standing, Nor
mal schools are mentioned for the
first time. It is customary for uni
versities of the Middle West to ad
mit graduates of approved State
Normal Schools.to Junior standing.
This credit the Committee on Ad
vanced Standing has always felt to
be excessive and has heretofore felt
able to recognize such Normal
work only in special cases and on
the special recommendation of par
ticular departments. Now, how
ever, the following has been
adopted as a fair solution of the
question:
"Recom mended graduates of the
San Francisco State Normal School,
and of other approved State Nor
mal Schools where the normal
training has been preceded by a
full four years' high school course,
may be granted an advanced cred
it of not more than thirty hours."
To the general regulation regard
ing entrance conditions the follow
ing has been added (page 52):
"All supplementary tests necessary
to give final entrance credit in any
recommended subjects must be ful
filled within one year after matric
ulation."
Under "Degrees" it will be noted
that the requirements for ihe de
gree of Bachelor of Laws have been
so modified as to admit to candi
dacy, in exceptional cases, special
students and regular undergradu
ates not candidates for the degree
of Bachelor of Arts."

Under "Courses of Instruction"
there are the usual variations. In
Romanic Languages special and
marked emphasis is given to Span
ish, which hereafter may be made
a major subject equally with
French. Five undergraduate courses
in Spanish are announced. Eng
lish Philology has been separated
from English Literature and Rhet
oric and made into an independent
department. In Philosophy the
Rev. Charles R. Brown has out
lined a course in the Life and Lit
erature of the Earlier Hebrews, to
alternate with the Ethics of Christ.
Under Education is outlined a
new form of Teachers' Recommen
dation, known as "The Higher
Recommendation," and established
by joint agreement with the Uni
versity of California, "to encourage
graduates to make additional and
special preparation for the higher
positions in the profession of teach
ing." This Higher Recommenda
tion will be based partly on suc
cessful experience in teaching and
will be granted only to the holders
of advanced degrees who are es
pecially recommended by one or
more departments as qualified
to teach particular subjects in Nor
mal schools or in the larger high
schools. New legislation of great
importance was enacted by the
last legislature by which the State
of California takes a long step for
ward in the matter of the profes
sional training of teachers. To aid
in meeting these new demands
these graded recommendations
have been devised. A large num
ber of additional courses have been
outlined in the Department of Ed
ucation, only a portion of which,
however, are to be given next year.
The Register shows 1389 students,
a gain of .58 over the previous year.
Of these, 936 registered from Cal
ifornia and 453, or nearly one
third, from other States and coun
tries. By major subjects English,
Law, and History head the list with
200, 195, and 143 respectively.
Statistics for the second semester
show that 567 different students
took work in English, 471 in His
tory, 161 in Law, 535 in Hygiene,
409 in German, and 320 in Eco
nomics. English shows the largest
total registration in all classes
(816), History following next with
774. There are 136 names prop
erly belonging to the faculty list,
divided as follows: Professors, 34;
associate professors, 19; assistant
professors, 22; instructors, 26; assis
tants, 32.

ward in the matter of the profes
sional training of teachers. To aid
in meeting these new demands
these graded recommendations
have been devised. A large num
ber of additional courses have been
outlined in the Department of Ed
ucation, only a portion of which,
however, are to be given next year.
The Register shows 1389 students,
a gain of .58 over the previous year.
Of these, 936 registered from Cal
ifornia and 453, or nearly one
third, from other States and coun
tries. By major subjects English,
Law, and History head the list with
200, 195, and 143 respectively.
Statistics for the second semester
show that 567 different students
took work in English, 471 in His
tory, 161 in Law, 535 in Hygiene,
409 in German, and 320 in Eco
nomics. English shows the largest
total registration in all classes
(816), History following next with
774. There are 136 names prop
erly belonging to the faculty list,
divided as follows: Professors, 34;
associate professors, 19; assistant
professors, 22; instructors, 26; assis
tants, 32.
The University Register for 1900-
01 will be ready for distribution
about May Bth. There are the
usual variations incident to a new
printer, and the usual shifting and
readjustment of courses, but no
startling changes in comparison
with Registers of former years.
Comparing with the Register for
1899-1900, the following promo
tions are noted:
To be Associate Professors: As
sistant Professors Peirce, Stearns,
and Johnston.
To be Assistant Professor: In
structor Blichfeldt.
To be Instructors: Assistants
Maddock, Muckleston, and Snod
grass.
The new men (above the rank of
Assistant) are: Assistant Professors
Curran and Lapsley, and Instruc
tors Bartlett, Seward, Rettger, War
ren, and Neidig.
New appointments to take effect
September Ist, are: Assistant Pro
fessors Ramsey, E. P. Anderson,
and Rieber; Instructors Bassett and
Snedden.
The most significant changes are
noted under "Admission" Require
ments. Heretofore the University
has given three credits only
in • English, although the sub
ject presupposes four years' work
and although four credits are given
at California, Michigan, and some
other universities. Four credits
will be given hereafter at Stanford,
the extra credit being allotted to
English Composition; but this ex
tra credit will be given only to
those who offer fifteen credits for
entrance. In the Register for
1899-1900, general reference was
made to the possibility of obtain
ing entrance credit in Manual
Training and some other subjects
not included in the regular entrance
list. The subjects there had in
mind have now been formally
listed, and are as follows: Biology
(one credit), Physiography (one
credit), Mechanical Drawing (one
half credit), Wood-working (one
half credit), Forge-work (one-half
credit), Foundry-work (one-half
credit), Machine shop (one credit).
It will be noticed also that here
after Elementary Algebra will
count one and a half credits instead
of two credits as heretofore. The
other half credit has been trans
ferred to Advanced Algebra, which
is now divided into three parts,
each part counting one-half credit.
The first part is the usual Ad
vanced Algebra given in the schools
and corresponds to Advanced Al
gebra, part I, of the University of
California requirements. Parts II
and 111, now at present given in the
schools, correspond exactly to the
lij'st course in Algebra in the De
partment of Mathmatics.
At present entrance examinations
are offered in all subjects three
times during the year. Hereafter
in order to take entrance examina
tions in January and May (not
applying in May, 1901) applicants
must give formal notice ten days
in advance, and if not students of
the University must have their

applications endorsed by their
teachers. For the present, formal
examinations are not to be set in
tiie new subjects (numbered 23 and
29), but special arrangements may
be made for the third and fourth
examination days.
Some changes are noted under
Admission on Recommendation.
Candidates fulfilling all require
ments for admission in full stand
ing to Bryn Mawr, California
(Groups 1 or II), Chicago, Co
lumbia, Cornell (A. B. course),
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Michi
gan, Smith, Vassar, Wellesley, or
Yale, will be admitted to full un
dergraduate standing without fur
ther tests. Candidates may also
take the regular entrance examina
tions of any one of these institu
tions, and also those given by the
College Entrance Examination
Hoard of the Middle States and
Maryland, in place of the Stan
ford examinations. The most in
teresting experiment now being
tried in connection with the rela
tions of universities and secondary
schools is that of the College En
trance Examination Board of the
Middle States and Maryland. It
is hoped in time that all the lead
ing universities will be included,
and that all entrance examina
tions at the University may be
superseded by the examinations of
this central board, in which all the
universities shall co-operate.
In Chemistry, it will be noted
that although the requirements
have not been changed, hereafter
notebooks need not be formally
shown to the Department. In or
der to be admitted to advanced
courses in Chemistry, however, it
will be necessary to pass the regu
lar entrance examination at the
University.
Under Advanced Standing, Nor
mal schools are mentioned for the
first time. It is customary for uni
versities of the Middle West to ad
mit graduates of approved State
Normal Schools.to Junior standing.
This credit the Committee on Ad
vanced Standing has always felt to
be excessive and has heretofore felt
able to recognize such Normal
work only in special cases and on
the special recommendation of par
ticular departments. Now, how
ever, the following has been
adopted as a fair solution of the
question:
"Recom mended graduates of the
San Francisco State Normal School,
and of other approved State Nor
mal Schools where the normal
training has been preceded by a
full four years' high school course,
may be granted an advanced cred
it of not more than thirty hours."
To the general regulation regard
ing entrance conditions the follow
ing has been added (page 52):
"All supplementary tests necessary
to give final entrance credit in any
recommended subjects must be ful
filled within one year after matric
ulation."
Under "Degrees" it will be noted
that the requirements for ihe de
gree of Bachelor of Laws have been
so modified as to admit to candi
dacy, in exceptional cases, special
students and regular undergradu
ates not candidates for the degree
of Bachelor of Arts."

Under "Courses of Instruction"
there are the usual variations. In
Romanic Languages special and
marked emphasis is given to Span
ish, which hereafter may be made
a major subject equally with
French. Five undergraduate courses
in Spanish are announced. Eng
lish Philology has been separated
from English Literature and Rhet
oric and made into an independent
department. In Philosophy the
Rev. Charles R. Brown has out
lined a course in the Life and Lit
erature of the Earlier Hebrews, to
alternate with the Ethics of Christ.
Under Education is outlined a
new form of Teachers' Recommen
dation, known as "The Higher
Recommendation," and established
by joint agreement with the Uni
versity of California, "to encourage
graduates to make additional and
special preparation for the higher
positions in the profession of teach
ing." This Higher Recommenda
tion will be based partly on suc
cessful experience in teaching and
will be granted only to the holders
of advanced degrees who are es
pecially recommended by one or
more departments as qualified
to teach particular subjects in Nor
mal schools or in the larger high
schools. New legislation of great
importance was enacted by the
last legislature by which the State
of California takes a long step for
ward in the matter of the profes
sional training of teachers. To aid
in meeting these new demands
these graded recommendations
have been devised. A large num
