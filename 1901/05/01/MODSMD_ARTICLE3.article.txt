# OVER-CAPITALIZATION.
## Professor Miller Lectures on Evils of Combination.â€”Present Tendency Toward Speculative Excess. 
### 
A large audience filled the
chapel this afternoon at 1:30, when
Professor Miller of Chicago deliv
ered his third lecture on Trusts.
Today he presented"The Case of
the People Against the Trusts."
He argued against over-capitaliza
tion and excessive speculation, out
lining their disadvantages and sug
gesting a remedy. He said:
"We now want to devote some
time to the evils of combination.
They are two: over-capitalization
and monopoly. Today 1 shall
speak of the evils of over-capitali
zation.
"Securities to investors in capi
talized enterprises are in two forms:
bonds and stocks. The bond holder
merely owns his capital and re
ceives interest on it at regular in
tervals, thus occupying a position
of the greatest security. The stock
holder, on the other hand, owns a
share in (he corporation itself, and
hence, though receiving a higher
rate of interest on his investment
for the time being, runs a far great
er chance of losing all his capital
should the enterprise fail. Most
of the stock on the market at the
present time represents nothing
but a certain indefinite claim on
the property of a joint stock com
pany or corporation.
"The cases are rare when the
capitalization of an enterprise is
not three or four times the actual
value of its stocks. This over
capitalization invariably means
one of two things : it either robs
the investor, or it robs the con
sumer. It is the chief encourager
of monopolies. There is a great
difference between the legitimate
and the illegitimate promotion of
business. Excessive promotion is
the chief cause of over-capitaliza
tion. The promoter often receives
a large block of stock, which makes
it directly to his interest to capital
ize an enterprise as largely as pos
sible. The public thus loses by in
vesting its money in an inflated
enterprise as much as promoter
gains by selling his share at a high
price after he has disposed of the
rest of the stock.
"At present, this tendency to
over-speculation is very dangerous.
Speculation and good business can
not go hand and hand. There is
as much difference between them
as between the gambler and the
merchant. If every investor would
insist upon an accurate financial
statement of the actual value of
the stock of an enterprise before
embarking his capital in it, a vast
and beneficial revolution would
take place in the industrial and
business world."
