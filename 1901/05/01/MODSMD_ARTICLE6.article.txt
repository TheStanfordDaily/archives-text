We are under the necessity oi
again asking the co-operation of the
members of the Senior Class in re
gard to the payment of the class
tax. This is a matter of great im
portance and should be attended to
at once. The collection of the as
sessments requires quite a sacrifice
of time on the part of the Finance
Committee, and it should not be de
layed or aggravated by the laxity
and neglect of members of the class.
All Seniors who have not done so
should settle this tax at once, so
that the class will not be further
hampered in carrying out arrange
ments for Commencement Week.
