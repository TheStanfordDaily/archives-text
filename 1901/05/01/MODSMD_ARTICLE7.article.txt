It might be well to notify the
players who are left in the hand
ball tournament of doubles that
there are only about two weeks
left in which to complete the con
tests. But one game has been
played within the last two weeks,
and unless the players get together
soon the tournament will end dis
astrously. The tournament of
singles was played off in much
less time than has already been
spent in this latter tourney, and it
was largely due to this fact that
the single contests attracted more
interest. The date of all games yet
to be played should be set for some
time during the next week, and
then those teams failing to appear
at the scheduled time should lose
by default. In this way time for
the final inter-class games will be
secured, and the torrnament will
have accomplished its end in de
termining the champion handball
players of the University.
