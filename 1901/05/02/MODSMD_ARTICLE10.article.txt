life which lias been much neglected
in the past, has been in regard to
musical matters. The University
Orchestra is an attempt to remedy
this defect in some measure. Nearly
twenty-five students of average
musical ability have been practicing
for several months on the music of
Haydn and others of the best com
posers. The student body should
encourage such organizations in
everyway possible, especially by at
tending their first concert, which
will be given next Thursday even
ing in the chapel.
