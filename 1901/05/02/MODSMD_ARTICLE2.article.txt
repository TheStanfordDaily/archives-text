### 
The following report of the re
ceipts and expenses of the Train
ing house Fund has been made up
to date by Dr. Frank Angell,
Treasurer:
Soon after I had left the Univer
sity in the spring of '99, Forrest
Fisher sent to Professor Murray,
who had kindly consented to look
after the Fund in my absence, a
statement of the receipts and ex
penses of the '99 committee. The
amount received by the committee
was $297.85,and Fisher nays: —"The
amount is what ought to be in the
hank, less expenses attached to en
tertainments given. Dr. Angell
looked after the expenses for the
Glee Club concert. I paid out
$4.50 expenses for Dr. Jordan's lec
ture and Dr. Angell paid $3.
About $20 has been spent by the
class in securing and having
printed postal cards which have
been sent out to graduates." The
cards referred to were "return pos
tals." In addition, there were
printed subscription blanks for the

undergraduates. The amount of
deposits up to May 26, 1900, was
$277.10. Consequently the amount
spent by the committee for return
postals, printing, etc., must have
been $20.75. Placing the expenses
of the committee at this figure, the
Training-house account stands as
follows:

sured by Treasurer H. 11. Taylor
that owing to the unusual nature
of the corporation the expenses of
incorporation had been unusually
great, Mr. Kollmayer having been
obliged to make repeated trips to
Sacramento for consultation with
the Attorney General of the State.
The bill was accordingly paid.
After consulting with Mr. Tay
lor, 1 invested, placing $1400 in a
building and loan association which
I considered conservatively man
aged and from which it would draw
a greater rate of interest (four to
five per cent) than in a savings
bank.
Unpaid subscriptions to the
amount of $171.50 have not been
reckoned in with the assets;, as it is
impossible to say how large a pro
portion of these can be collected.
