# "MONOPOLY."
## Fourth Lecture on Trusts by Professor A. C. Miller of Chicago. 
### 
Professor Miller of Chicago de
livered his fourth lecture on Trusts
in the chapel this afternoon. He
chose as his subject "Monopoly."
"Monopoly," the speaker said,
"is the essence of the trust problem.
From the first coming of the trust,
some twenty years ago, the cry of
monopoly has been raised. If the
calamitists can prove that the
trust is simply monopoly, then it
should be condemned. Monopoly
is economic tyranny.
"Monopolies have been divided
into two groups, natural and legal
monopolies. Examples of the first
class are the telephone, -railroad, or
petroleum supply. Examples of
legal monopoly are the copyright
or patent. To these two classes
some Americans propose to add a
new group called capitalistic or in
dustrial monopoly. This group is
comprised of trusts.
"The Standard Oil Company is
the oldest of the trusts and the
most successful. Everyone knows
that this company gained its suc
cess in two ways, at first through
discrimination in railroad rates,
then through purchase and lease of
the supply of crude oil. Thus it
has been allied with natural mo
nopolies from its inception.
"The whiskey trust formed in
1887 has been a failure, partly be
cause of the greediness of its man
agers, but more because the busi
ness of distilling whiskey is not in
its nature capable of being a mo
nopoly.
"These two caees illustrate the
difference between two classes of
business both characterized as
trusts. It shows the difference be
tween a natural monopoly and a
large business enterprise. I be
lieve that trusts cannot remain
monopolistic except as allied with
natural monopolies. No doubt
many of the trust magnates would
like to achieve monopoly, but the
ever-present competition is there to
hold them on their good behavior."
