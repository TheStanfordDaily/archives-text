# Ornithologists to Meet.
## 
### 
The regular bi-monthly meeting
of the Cooper Ornithological Club
is to be held next Saturday, May
4th, in room 80 quad, commencing
at 8 o'clock. The program is to
consist of papers dealing with the
experiences of three Stanford bird
lore enthusiasts: Zoology Instruct
or John 0. Snyder is to speak on
"A Day with the Birds near Tam
pico, Mexico"; R. E. Snodgrass, '01,
on the "Galapagos Islands"; and
Edmund Heller, '01, on "The Birds
of the Galapagos Islands." The
scientific session will be an open one.
The club is composed of Cali
fornia's most enthusiastic students
of bird life, and its aim is the
furthering of scientific investiga
tions along that line. Meetings
are held at the invitation of the
various members, and the results
of the naturalists' work are pub
lished in the club's bi-monthly
magazine, the Condor. The presi
dent of the organization is Joseph
Grinnell, a graduate student in
our Zoological department.
