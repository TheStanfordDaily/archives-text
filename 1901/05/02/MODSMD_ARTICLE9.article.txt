President McKinley, in hie trip
across the continent, is being made
the recipient of one demonstration
after another. Each place he visits
tries to excel its rivals. By a
fortunate coincident, he will arrive
at the University on Memorial Day,
the fourteenth anniversary of the
laying of the cornerstone for this
institution. We can best do him
honor by a simple and cordial
greeting. He has kindly consented
to address the students, and all
will endeavor to see and hear the
chief magistrate of our nation. Be
fore he reaches California he will
be surfeited with ostentatious dis
play of enthusiasm. Let our wel
come be spontaneous and unaffected.
