Editor Daily Halo Alto:
Mr. J. J. Morris of Palo Alto,
through enthusiasm for music and
generous public spirit, has given
his time this year, without com
pensation, to the Choral Society.
As a result, the society has sung
very creditably on several public
occasions and its members have re
ceived excellent discipline in sight
reading and choral singing. At the
request of the University, Mr. Mor
ris has undertaken to provide cho
ral music for Baccalaureate Sunday.
It would seem only just, therefore,
that the members of the society
who have had the benefit of his
leadership should recognize their
obligation to him by regular atten
dance. I take the liberty of urging
the members of the society to ful
fill this duty even at the cost of
some personal inconvenience; and of
in viting'others who sing to join the
society now and so to give Mr.
Morris the support which his un
selfish effort deserves.
The chorus meets every Monday
at 4:30 p.m. in the chapel.
Very respectfully,
Mary Roberts Smith.
