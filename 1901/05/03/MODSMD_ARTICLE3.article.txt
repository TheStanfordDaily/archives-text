# REMEDIES FOR TRUSTS.
## Professor Miller Delivers His Final Lecture, and Summarizes the Previous Ones. 
### 
Professor A. C. Miller of Chicago
delivered his last lecture on Trusts
in the chapel this afternoon. He
said in part:
"The benefits and evils of trusts
have both been fully established.
For advantages, we have the saving
of industrial energy by diminish
ing the waste due to competition,
and the increased efficiency of pro
duction by the saving of labor in
cident to large combinations of
capital. The disadvantages of
trusts are of three kinds: to the in
vestor, to the consumer, and to the
competitor. The investor is often
plundered and deceived by mis
representation of the assets of a
corporation, and by the over-cap
italization or watering of its stock.
The consumer suffers from extor
tionate prices, in so far as the
trust exercises the power of a mo
nopoly. The competition suffers
by having to compete with a large
amount of capital and labor cen
tered in the possession of one cor
poration and giving it an opportun
ity to shut out competition. In
short, we may conclude that some
trusts have helped the community,
but that most have injured it at
one time or another.
"It has been proposed to crush
trusts by legislating against them,
and many attempts have been
made to do it, notably the Sher
man anti-trust law of 1890. But
these efforts have had no effect.
Combination has gone on despite
the power of law. But I do not
think we should destroy them. We
want to preserve them as far as we
can consistently with their doing
no evil.
"Many people believe that trusts
are a necessary, inevitable evil.
But this evolutionary theory is
mistaken. Society is more than
an insentient organism. its ac
tivity depends largely on human
effort. Nor can we sanction the
attitude of those who tell us to
wait passively without doing any
thing. We recognize the evils of
trusts, and we must do something.
The question is—what shall that
something be? Though a certain
degree of secrecy in a private busi
ness is perfectly justifiable, we
must not lie misled by this phrase
"private business." The question
is purely one of social expediency.
Individual rights must be given
up when they threaten to become
monopoly rights, for then we have
a right to a full statement of the
trusts' business principles and fi
nancial standing. We must also
have a definite responsibility of the
trust to the stockholders. Pub
licity and responsibility, then, are
necessary to conserve the interests
of these stockholders in trusts, of
the laborers, and of the community
as a whole."
