We make a plea to the Stanford
athletes—track, football, baseball,
and tennis—to keep in light train
ing from now on. It will pay every
man to take care of himself; it is,
moreover, the least thing he can do
for his University. Races and
games are won or lost months be
fore the bleachers begin to be filled.
It has been to Stanford's lasting
disgrace that her athletes could do
what they pleased in training or
out of it, ,and the sick men in
crimson shirts last field-day showed
that they had not kept training
rules. Now is a good time to begin to
beat Berkeley, and, having begun,
to keep it up.
