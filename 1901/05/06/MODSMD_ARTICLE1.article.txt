Notre Dame, perhaps the best track
coach of the United States. It is
said that McCaughern w ; ll induce
Moulton to come to California next

McCaughern for some time and has
virtually promised him to wear the
Stanford colors next year.

distances being the hundred yard
and two hundred and twenty yard
dashes, in the first of which he
holds a record often and one-fifth
seconds. He has also made the

Six points in last year's .intercol
legiate field-day are to his credit,
five won by making first in the
hundred, and one by making third
in the two-twenty. This year he
was disabled by the rupture of a
tendon in his right leg, the acci
dent occurring in the first heat of
the hundred yard dash, during the
inter-class field-day, March 29th.
