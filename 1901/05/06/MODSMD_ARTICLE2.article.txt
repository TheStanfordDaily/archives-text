A number of interesting articles
were recently received by President
Jordan from Carroll Briscoe of
Blackwell, Oklahoma, and have
been placed in the Museum for safe
keeping. The collection consists
of an orginal burial ode and psalm
used at the funeral of Abraham
Lincoln; an official invitation to
accompany Abraham Lincoln's
body from Washington to .Spring
field issued from the Adjutant-Gen
eral's office, April iiO, 1805, to Hon.
J. K. Dubois; an autograph letter
of the noted abolitionist orator,
Owen Lovejoy; and an autograph of
Hon. John Schofield, formerly chief
justice of Illinois Supreme Court.
The most interesting exhibit re
ceived by the Museum in the last
year is that of the remains of an
Apache papoose and its cradle,
which was presented to the Museum
through C. A. Rouiller, '04, whose
father and uncle were in charge
of the workmen who discovered it.
It was found in one of the bat
guano caves near Paraje, New Mex
ico, beneath eight feet of guano and
between two rocks where it must
have lain for a great length of time.
The cradle and papoose are both in
a fair state of preservation. The
papoose was partly mummified

when found and crumbled some
what when exposed to the air.
It was wrapped in a piece of
buckskin and lay in the cradle,
which is made of willow reeds
bound together with buckskin
thongs. The workmen in unearth
ing it broke off the upper part of
the skull. Otherwise the skeleton
is intact, parts of the mummified
flesh still remaining, one ear being
especially noticeable. The exhibit
has been cleaned and putin shape
by Curator Peterson and placed in
the Indian room of the Museum.
With this exhibit came a pair of
Indian sandals made of palma,
which were found in a cave near
the same place. There have been
no Indians in that region for many
years, and these sandals must be
very old. Some fine specimens of
petrified juniper and cedar wood
from New Mexico were also pre
sented by Mr. Rouiller.
