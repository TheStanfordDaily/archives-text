# Y.M.C.A.'s Good Showing.
## 
### 
The growth of the Y. M. 0. A.
work this year gives encouraging
promise for a more signal advance
ment next year. The present mem
bership is 110, as against a total
of 37 last May. All the commit
tees of the various departments are
well organized and manned.
The chairmen are as follows:
Bible Study department, Anderson
Thomas; Missionary department,
Angus Hull; Social Work commit
tee, Percy A. Martin; Religious
Meetings committee, A. W. Baird;
Financial department, R. B. Hum
mel.
The books show an expenditure
for the year of $450.00, nearly all
of which amount has been raised.
As the conduct and supervision
of the work of the Association in
all of its departments has already
assumed too large proportions to be
adequately attended to by a student
carrying a full course, it has been
fornd necessary to employ a Gen
eral Secretary. This office in the
college association is similar to the
treasurership or student manager in
the student body.
L. E. Harter, who has been
chosen for the General Secretary,
leaves for the East next week to
study the methods and work of
some of the strongest college asso
ciations there. He will visit the
Northwestern University, the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, Illinois, then
going further east will spend a few
days at Yale and Harvard. While
at Boston, Harter will have the
privilege of attending, as a delegate
from the West, "The Jubilee" which
celebrates fifty years of Y. M. C. A.
growth in America. Frank Leslie's
Weekly says: "No world's con vention
has yet been held which this meet
ing of young men is not likely to
equal or excel in poplar interest
and widespread influence." There
will be 3000 delegates, representing
twenty-five countries. Among the
speakers already promised are the
President of the United States
and the High Commissioner of
Canada. From Boston, Harter will
visit Columbia University, return
ing to Northfield, Mass., to attend
the Students' Summer Conference.
After the close of the ten days' ses
sion he will visit the Pan-American
Exposition and relatives in Ohio.
