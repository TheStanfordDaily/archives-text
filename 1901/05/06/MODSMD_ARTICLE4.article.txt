The Rev. William H. Greenburg,
D. D., of Sacramento delivered the
Sunday sermon in the chapel yes
terday, on "What is Righteous
ness?" He said in part:
<l ln all times religion has suf
fered from the misconstruction
placed upon it by ignorant persons.
We go to church once or twice a
week, and seek relief from the
cares of the world and commune
with God, and then return to the
daily machinery of our lives.
Such a religion as this, which ap
peals to us only occasionally, is
a formalized and ossified religion.
What we need is a closer, personal
religion that enters into our daily
lives, and makes us better, nobler
men. The world is growing better,
we are moving in the right direc
tion, due to the great moral and
intellectual influences that are be
ing brought to bear on the men
of today.
"Many people think that the
gospel of righteousness savors of
sanctimoniousness, simply because
they do not understand the mean
ing of this term "righteousness."
No one is immaculate, no one is
perfect. We are all sinners. But
the truly righteous man is the man
whose every word and deed show
his refinement of sentiment, his
purity of thought, and his nobility
of purpose. Such men make the
world wiser, better, and happier
for their very presence in it. To
do the right in the teeth of wrong,
to do what is in our power to help
our fellow beings, and to display
keen sympathy with them, this is
righteousness. The endeavor to
help ourselves and to conquer
the temptations that assail us on
every hand is the gospel of right
eousness.
"1 unhesitatingly take my stand
with those who think the world is
growing better and brighter. 1
think the gospel of righteousness
is becoming stronger with the pas
sage of years. Even high-toned
society is gradually learning the
lesson of brotherly iove, and begin
ning to recognize its past sins.
The present tendency is to lead
the worthy poor gently by the
hand, and quietly and without os
tentation relieve it of its wants.
Somehow good will be the final
goal to ill. The moral achieve
ments of the nineteenth century
are stupendous, though we are still
far from the ideals so beautifully
depicted by the prophets and sages
of olden times.
"We cannot go through life with
out temptations to conquer and
sorrows to overcome. Without
these very obstacles and difficulties
besetting our paths, this world
would be but a lethargic and un
interesting world. The true and
world-wide religion can reach the
accomplishment of the ideal only
when love knows no barriers be
tween creeds and unites man to
man in one universal band of sym
pathy. The gospel of righteousness
is to herald the dawn of a new era,
in which it will grow and expand
till it reaches the innermost heart

of all mankind. Then, and only
then, shall we have the perfect
man."
