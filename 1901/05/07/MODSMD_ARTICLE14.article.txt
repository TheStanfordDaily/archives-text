## 
### 
The Sigma. Alpha Episilon fra
ternity hats awarded the contract
for the erection of a new chapter
house to be built on the campus.
It is to be located on Salvatierra
street on the lot between the Delta
LJpsilon house and the private resi
dence of Mrs. Maitland. Plans
were prepared by Thorp and
Holmes of San Francisco, and
ground will be broken shortly for
the foundations.
The new house is to be old col
onial in design, and in dimensions
will be eighty feet long by forty
feet in breadth. Eight large col
umns will surmount the front and
will run to the roof. On the first
floor there will be a large reception
room or hall, and billiard and
dining rooms, and a library. The
second floor will contain twelve
sleeping rooms,and will be equipped
with baths and showers. Every
room is to have toilets and lava
tories. In the basement there will
be three servants' rooms, a trunk
and bicycle room, and a chapter
room. The cost of the house will
be $11,000.
Next year will in all probability
see every college fraternity located
on the campus. Jt may be stated
with authority that the Phi Kappa
Psi, the Delta Tau Delta, and the
Kappa Sigma fraternities will
leave their Palo Alto houses at the
close of this semester and move to
the campus. The Sigma Rho Eta
fraternity will in all probability
move from Mayfield and be on the
campus next year. This exodus to
the campus will be a decided ad
vantage to all concerned. It will
serve to unify student life on the
campus, and will tend to bring
Stanford more to the pattern of
Princeton and Oxford, where all
university life is centered within a
short distance from the college
buildings.
