Every semester, as the time ap
proaches for the editor of the Daily
Palo Alto to lay down his pen, it
has become the custom for him to
say a few words of praise for the
members of his staff. Not one
of those who have controlled
the destinies of this paper
could do so with more truth
fulness than the present editor.
The managing editor, news editor,
associate and assistant editors, have
all worked faithfully, and it would
lie hard to say which one deserves
more commendation than another.
Each and every one of them has
our sincere thanks, and although
this is pretty poor pay, it is all
they can expect to receive until the
faculty acts upon the suggestion of
our predecessors and allows Uni
versity credit for work on the
Daily.
