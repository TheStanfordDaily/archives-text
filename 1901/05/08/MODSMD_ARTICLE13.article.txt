For the first time in its history,
the University is next Tuesday to
receive an active President within
its gates. And surfeited as the
visitor will he by the time he
reaches Palo Alto with a weari
some round of social functions, set
speeches, and still more exhausting
attentions from an inconsiderate
populace, it lies with us to make
the University stand out in the
President's memory as an oasis in
a desert. At every stopping place
en route from Washington he has
been pushed and jostled about, un
til it is no wonder that he is re
ported to be bordering on a physi
cal collapse. Mounted police have
been necessary to keep him from
the kindly clutches of the mob.
When he speaks indoors the crowd
has persisted in remaining and
blocking the egress until the Presi
dent has been compelled to beat an
undignified retreat through back
doors and blind alleys. Such in
cidents must be gratifying as indi
cations of popularity, but it is safe
to assume that no man was ever
more weary of adulation than Mr.
McKinley. Our reception may be
made the antithesis of all this. Let
us give the President breathing
space, a chance to look around him,
and as little tumult as is compatible
with Western lungs. When he
speaks in the Assembly Hall, let
us for once be on time, and omit
the slamming of doors and thun
dering of feet that usually punctu
ate the remarks of visitors at Stan
ford. Others have welcomed the
President in their own way; let the
University have its turn, and greet
him not as south-of-Market would
its favorite barrel-head orator, but
as a company of students. We
want him to be impressed not only
with our surroundings —which is
inevitable —but with ourselves.
