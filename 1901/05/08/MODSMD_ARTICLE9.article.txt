# Professor Farrand Lectures.
## 
### 
Professor Max Farrand, the
Princeton man who has just been
appointed professor of History, de
livered the first of his three lectures
on "The Territorial Development
of the United States" in the chapel
this afternoon. He gave a sketch
of the territorial growth of our
country and his reasons for think
ing that the acquisition of new
possessions has strengthened the
unity of the States. He deplored
the recent war with Spain, but
thought that its results had greatly
benefited the United States. He
did not think that our Constitution
was violated by the acquisition of
the Philippines, but merely broad
ly interpreted, and he drew atten
tion to the fact that President
Jefferson changed his mind on the
question of constitutionality of the
acquisition of Louisiana.
Professor Farrand is a quiet but
very forceful speaker. He holds
the attention of his audience by
his close reasoning and force of
style, rather than by his manner
of presentation. He will lecture
tomorrow afternoon on the ques
tion of the advisability of making
our new possessions states of the
Union, and on Friday he will de
liver his last lecture, on reasons
for believing the acquisition of
these possessions inevitable.
