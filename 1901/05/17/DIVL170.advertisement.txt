THE X-RAY
Tells the truth
Don't depend too much on old fashioned
medical methods. Don't believe every
thing you are told. Lots of people are be
ing treated for the wrong disease. Have
an X-Ray picture taken of your internal
organs, bones, joints, etc. You will then
know the truth. Know exactly where and
what the trouble is. Then your chances
of being cured will be good. For a thor
oughly good, reliable picture, call at the
