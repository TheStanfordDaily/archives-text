# NEW TRACK TRAINER.
## "Dad" Moulton of Notre Dame Will Have Charge of the Stanford Track Team Next Year. 
### 
E. U. Moulton will train our
athletes next year. His letter with
propositions was received yester
day by Treasurer Nourse, and an
immediate acceptance was wired
by him.
He is anxious to come to the
Coast on account of his wife's
health. He will arrive here on
the first of {September and will re
side in Palo Alto, but will have
charge of the training table on the
campus. He will have charge of
the training and conditioning of
the men throughout the whole year
and will coach the track men.
"Dad" Moulton is known among
athletes as "the father of training."
He has trained more men and de
veloped a greater proportion of
record-breakers than any man in
the United States. He is about
forty years of age and has all his
life been closely associated with
American athletics. He was a
sprinter when a young man, and
broke records both in the one-hun
dred and two-hundred-and-twenty
yard dashes. Throughout his ca
reer he has strictly refrained from
all dissipation, and refuses to have
anything to do with an athlete who
will not keep training rules.
Moulton's career as a trainer is
an enviable one. For five years he
had charge of Minnesota's athletes,
and has been two years at Wiscon
sin and one year at Michigan. He
trained the track men of Vander
biit University for three years. It
is significant that this university
was the poorest of the Middle
States universities, and that dur
ing the second and third years of
his training they came out victori
ous.
Moulton has brought out some
great sprinters and hurdlers from
among the men of those colleges
where he has been trainer. Kraenz
lein, Pennsylvania's greatest hur
dler, was developed at Wisconsin
by Moulton, running the 120 yard
hurdles in 15 3-5 seconds. At
Wisconsin he discovered May bury,
who afterwards ran the 100 yards
at Chicago in 9 4-5 and the 220 in
21 2-5, the fastest 220 ever run on
a turn. He trained PatO'Dea, the
great kangaroo kicker from Wis
consin, and made him the fastest
hurdler in the Middle West. Fred
L. Powers, the greatest all-round
college athlete who ever lived, was
trained by Moulton. Powers was
the winner of the all-round cham
pionship meet for the United States
at New York in 1899. Among a
long list of record-breakers who
have come under "Dad's" care are
Johnnie Crum, the "lowa wonder,"
as he was called; Rush, who ran
the 100 at Chicago in 9 4-5; "Cuc
koo" Collins, who took the Shef
field handicap race in England,
the first time that it was ever won
by an American. He also had
charge of the famous Morgan and
Wright team which was on the
National Bicycle Circuit in 1896.
Moulton for the past year has been
at the University of Notre Dame.
At the annual indoor meet last
February between Notre Dame, the

University of Chicago, and the
University of Illinois, Notre Dame's
athletes won easily. Directly after
this meet the Notre Dame Scholaa
tic 112 with other words of praise for
Moulton, had this to say: "'Dad'
must certainly get credit for mak
ing the most of his material. He
has developed six men who can run
a quarter under 52 and seven who
can make it in less than 53."
