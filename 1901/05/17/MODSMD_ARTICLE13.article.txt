With the announcement that
the management has succeeded in
securing "Dad" Moulton of Notre
Dame to coach next year's track
team and look after the general
physical training of all Stanford's
athletes, there must come renewed
enthusiasm over our prospects for
future years. It has long been
clear that the work of properly
looking after a baseball squad and
a track team simultaneously is an
impossibility for one man, and
with the new arrangement there
must be improvement along both
these lines. If past records count
for anything, this is the man we
have been looking for. His sys
tem of training is in accord with
the dicta of laws of hygiene and
common sense, and its success is
attested by the phenomenal list of
record-breakers developed under
his tutelage. Moulton is an advo
cate of continuous rather than
spasmodic training. He believes
that events are oftenest won by
months of careful living. That
such is the proper attitude we have
all along insisted, and we feel justi
fied in venturing the prediction that
if aspirants for the Varsity "S" do
their share, our records on the cin
der-path are bound to take on
newer and brighter hues.
