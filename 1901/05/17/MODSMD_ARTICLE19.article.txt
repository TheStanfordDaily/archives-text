Editor Daily Pai.o Alto:
Some time ago the Daily Palo
Alto had an editorial urging stu
dents to contribute articles to the
Museum, and it is for the purpose
of making this policy more explicit
that I now write. During the next
three months many students will
come across articles practically
valueless outside of a museum, but
which would be of much value to
our ethnological department. In
dian arrowheads, skulls, beads,
baskets, etc., are desirable articles.
As an axample of the proper spirit
1 point to the donation of Mr. C.
A. Uouiller, '04. He gave us an
Apache cradle and papoose, which,
though of littie value to himself,
will henceforth interest hundreds
of people. Anything relating to
the early history of California will
be specially appreciated: old docu
ments, paintings, drawings, or
prints, mission relics, early Span
ish serapes, costumes, lariats, etc.
Any package meant for the Mu
seum addressed to "Curator of the
Stanford Museum" will be carried
by the Wells-Fargo Co. free of
charge. Details of its history and
the place where it was found, to
gether with the name and address
of the donor, should accompany
each article.
Any further information in this
regard will be gladly given by me
at the Museum.
