Below is the argument of the play:
The plot of the travesty is woven
about the destinies of the beautiful
Princess of Leeland. There are
two suitors for her hand, the dissi
pated and repulsive king of Mil
pitas, and Phillip of Pescadero, the
man of science in disguise. The
imperious queen of Leeland, who
is socially and financially ambit
ious, has her heart set on a royal
match for her daughter with Mil
pitas. The king of Leeland has
made an offer in an unrepealed
statute of the hand of his daughter
in marriage to any one who shall
kill the dragon, Spitfire, which is
laying waste the kingdom. Prince
Phillip comes to court under the
assumed name of Knight Sir Lost
alot with the purpose of winning
the princess by killing the dragon.
The princess in order to escape
marrying Mil pitas engages the at
tentions of Sir Knight Alexander,
a warm number, who has come to
court under the wing of Lady
Helen, the companion of the prin
cess, who becomes fiercely jealous.
The gay court jester is set on by
the suspicious queen and the prime
minister to shadow the princess
and Sir Alexander, on pain of los
ing his head if they carry out their
plans of elopement or the princess
does not marry Milpitas. The
king orders the auspices by the
sacred tamale to see if all is going
well in the kingdom. The olive is
found to be missing and the king
dom is on the verge of ruin at the
hands of the dragon. Through the
detective work of the jester and
Lady Helen, the plans of elope
ment of Alexander and the prin
cess are foiled and the bold knight
condemned to death. He escapes
his fate by volunteering to fight
the dragon single-handed. The
princess has been oflicially engaged
to Milpitas, and her fate seems in
evitable. She goes to the witch of
Frenchman's Lake to get a charm
to destroy her beauty and defeat
Milpitas, and there meets Sir Lost
alot, who vvoos her and promises to
kill the dragon and restore her
beauty. The jester in alarm at
the turn of affairs gets a charm
from witch to make his neck axe
proof.
King of Milpitas comes to claim
his bride, but finds her beauty
gone, repudiates the match, and de
clares war. The dragon comes on
his destructive course to court, and
after killing all the king's knights
is overcome by Sir Lostalot as he
is about to devour the palace. Sir
Lostalot's antidote to witch's
charms fails to restore the prin
cess's beauty. Despair. Jester
gets the antidote from the witch,
restores his own neck, restores the
witch to beauty, gives Sir Lostalot
the secret. He restores the prin
cess as he is about to be denounced
as a charlatan, and discovers his
identity. Lady Helen wins Sir

Alexander. A happy culmination,
of course.
