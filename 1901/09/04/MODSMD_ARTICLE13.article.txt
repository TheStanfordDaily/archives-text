# Student Body Assessment.
## 
### 
The Associated Students levies
annually on every member an as
sessment of one dollar to defray
expenses of football, baseball,
track, and debating contests.
These are the only dues collected
by the association during the year,
and it is important that they be
paid at the opening of the year, as
funds are needed to start the foot
ball season.
John T. Nourbe, Treasurer.
