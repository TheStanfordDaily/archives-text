# FOOTBALL AT CALIFORNIA.
## Womble Succeeds Smith. Captain Smith, Gammon and Cornish Will Not Return. 
### 
At the University of California
the football season was formally
opened last Thursday by a meet
ing of all the men who intend to
play this year. Dr. Frank Simp
son, the graduate coach, Graduate
Manager Decoto, Professor Syle,
Colonel G. C. Edwards, Trainer
Christie, "Rex" Womble,* and E. J.
Brown, former football manager,
addressed those present.
Captain Warren Smith's failure
to return because of deficiency in
college work is a severe blow to the
team. Smith was also baseball
catcher and has been looked upon
as one of the strongest athletes
ever at California. He has signed
to coach the University of Oregon
team this fall, thus professional
izing himself. The team also loses
Gammon, who played half with
Smith and who will likewise not
return this fall. The other varsity
men are back, with the exception
of Cornish, who has a position in
Southern California.
Yesterday Womble, who has
played such a strong game at end
for the past three seasons, and who
barely failed of election to the cap
taincy last year, was unanimously
chosen by the football squad to
succeed Smith. He served as field
captain last season. Womble
learned the game under Cochran,
and is considered the best end ever
developed by California.
Much gratification is expressed
at the showing of new material
which has just entered. Among
those who have been prominent on
academic teams are Volz and
Saeltzer, backs, and De Merritt,
end of Berkeley High; Pringle,
guard; Hatch and Stroud, tackles;
and Coombs, half of Boone; Stines
and Lewitt,ends; and Craig, tackle
of Lowell; Graves, half of Poly
technic; Kelsey, fullback of Lick;
Garretson, end of San Diego High;
Savage, half from Vallejo; Howard,
half of Oakland High, and Risley,
half of Fresno High; McFarlen and
Posey of Peralta Hall; Geary,
quarter from University of Wash
ington, is among the new material,
and Payne, of the University of
Oregon, will probably enter.
The following freshmen signed
for practice at the meeting last
week: T. R. Plant, W. A. Jefferes,
11. 11. Howard, J. T. Van Loben
Sels, Dudley Saeltzer, W. H. Mer

E. Schuessman, V. N. Metcalf, J.
L. Dobbins.
Ad, Kelly, the Princeton half
back who coached California dur
ing the season of '99-'OO, is in San
Francisco and has signified his in
tention of assisting with the coach
ing this year. Graduate Coach
Simpson, known as "Doc," took his
degree in '97, afterwards complet
ing work at the medical college.
He has since been resident physi
cian at Byron Hot Springs Sani
tarium. He coached the Oregon
team two years ago. Simpson
played tackle when in college and
is looked upon as the fastest man
who ever held that position for the

Blue and Gold. He has expressed
himself as pleased at the outlook
for a strong team this year.
The decision of Horan, who
gained such a strong reputation on
the team at Lafayette, to enter
Stanford, occasioned considerable
disappointment. He hall been ex
pected to enter Berkeley.
Active practice began on the
California campus last evening.
Bleachers have been erected along
the west side of the field and the
gridiron is in good shape for the
preliminary jn-actice. As usual
the men wereatVwiÂ§d into squads
and for the first week iight work
will be in order.
A t 8 o'clock last night the first
football rally of the season was
held on the baseball diamond.
