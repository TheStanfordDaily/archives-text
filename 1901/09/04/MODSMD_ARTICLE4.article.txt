# Students' Employment Bureau.
## 
### 
The Students' Employment Bu
reau of the Christian Associations
has a list of men and women on
its cards who are anxious to do
any kind of work that is to be had
about the University. Some of the
students who register at the bureau
are experts along the lines for
which help is most needed.
Let us know, either by postal
card or in person, at the Informa
tion Bureau on the northeast cor
ner of the quad, what you need
done. We shall send you the man
who will do your work best.
The rate for student labor is
twenty cents per hour. For board
the student expects to work three
hours a day, namely, one hour for
each meal, and for his room one
hour a day. Thus a student's
board and room may be made by
working four hours a day, waiting
on table, washing dishes, or doing
general house or out-door work.
The Employment Bureau is not
a means of dispensing charity.
Rules determine its policy. Con
cretely those rules are: to help only
those who are anxious to help
themselves, to guarantee good ser
vice to those who apply for men,
to require faithful service from
those who accept jobs, and to refuse
further assistance to those who do
not keep their promises. All com
munications should be addressed to
Lloyd E. Harter,
(ieneral Secretary Y. M. C. A.
