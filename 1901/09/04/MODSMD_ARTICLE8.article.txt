With this first, issue we desire to
give an outline of the editorial
policy of the Daily Palo Alto in
the hope that by making it known
its own efficiency may be increased.
Students "and members of the fac
ulty have not heretofore shown
enough interest in the staff organi
zation of this paper. Often they do
not realize that a close friend occu
pies a high position on the official
board. On account of this disinter
estedness, and perhaps because of
the apparent impracticability of
getting University credit for the
work of members of the editorial
staff, and the inability of giving any
substantial remuneration for those
efforts, the work of staff members
has not been very satisfactory to
previous editors. The results have
shown considerable indifference and
irresponsibility on the part of asso
ciates and assistants, which, if we
consider tlie circumstances, is not
surprising.
At most of the universities and
colleges in other parts of the coun
try a sharp competition is carried
on for positions on the daily publi
cations, and a staff member holds
it on merit. Naturally it is consid
ered quite an honor to hold such a
place. But at Stanford there are
very few applications for places on
the Daily Palo Alto. The editor
in-chief has usually been compelled
to build his staff by personal solici
tation. What it lacked in numbers
he has had to make up by imposing
an extra burden on its most faith
ful and willing members. This, of
course, is an injustice, but it is
the way the paper has been
managed and will have to be man
aged unless there is a change in
student body sentiment.
The lack of recognition received
by those who are striving daily to
make the paper a credit to the Uni
versity and a convenience to the
community is very discouraging
from a journalistic point of view.
Considerable glory in athletics or

an enviable record in the class room
might be gained by expending the
same or even a less amount of en
ergy in those lines. The question
is, how can the work be made more
efficient?
With University credit impracti
cable and compensation impossible,
the only apparent incentive that
remains to staff members for hard,
consistent, and conscientious work
is an increased appreciation on the
part of the whole community in the
efforts of that staff. By such an in
terest a certain honor will attach to
all places on the Daily, which
would incite all on the editorial
board, and create a much needed
rivalry among its members, who
would take a just pride in seeing
their names among the list at the
head of this column.
It is with the desire of fostering
some such sentiment in our readers
and editorial staff that we purpose
to establish a system of competition
in our staff organization. A daily
record of the material brought in
by each member of the staff will be
kept, and at the end of the week a
report showing just what has been
done during the week by each asso
ciate and assistant will be filed.
With these reports as guides,
changes in the order of the staff
will be made from time to time.
All new officers will be expected
to serve a short term on trial in
order to test their sincerity and to
prove their ability. After satisfac
tory fulfillment of the probation
they will be given positions on the
staff in such order as a comparison
of their work with that of all the
staff members entitles them.
Work on the Daily is a valuable
experience to every student. It
gives an intimate acquaintance with
all branches of University life. A
reporter receives many courtesies
from the community and is allowed
privileges otherwise impossible. He
is intimately associated with all
college activities, and gains a great
deal of useful knowledge concern
ing his University outside the limits
of his major department.
In order that the system of com
petition as outlined may be suc
cessful, it is important that every
one willing to work make applica
tion for a place on our staff. A
long list of applicants will increase
the rivalry for good positions and
therefore give better results. No
one should hesitate to apply be
cause of the lack of experience.
Everything has a beginning. .Nor
should an}' one stand back because
they are not personally acquainted
with the members of the staff. Our
policy as just stated, assures every
one a hearty welcome and a good
chance-of success.
