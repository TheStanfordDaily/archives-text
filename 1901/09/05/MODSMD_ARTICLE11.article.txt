Chas. M. Fickert, the famous
guard on Stanford's eleven in the
days when the Cardinal never knew
defeat, has arrived to direct our
football interests this year. One
more thoroughly familiar with the
spirit, traditions, and football his
tory of Stanford, and no one more
capable of teaching the game and
instructing the players, could have
been secured. We all salute our
first graduate coach!
