# Dr. Jordan's Vacation.
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan spent most of the
summer in the work of tluj Ha
waiian Investigation Commission.
The purpose of this commission is
to ascertain the present condition
of the marine industries of Hawaii,
the value of their products, their
past history, and the legislation
necessary for their preservation.
The work is conducted by the U. S.
Fish Commission, and is under the
direction of President Jordan and
Dr. B. W. Evermann, assisted by
Dr. O. P. Jenkins, J. N. Cobb, E. L.
Goldsborough and M. Suido, with
C. B. Hudson and A. H. Baldwin as
artists.
Large collections of the shore
fishes have been made, about 400
species in all, 50 of them being new
to science.
In the winter the work will be
continued by the U. S. Fish Com
mission steamer Albatross, in the
deeper waters between the islands
and about the off-shore banks. It
is expected that upwards of 200 new
species will be obtained from this
source. The work of the Albatross
will be directed by some one of the
Stanford staff. A preliminary re
port will be made to Congress in
October. The final report with col
ored plates will be ready in a year
or so.

chairman of the section in zoology
and Dr. Campbell is chairman elect
of the section in botany. Profes
