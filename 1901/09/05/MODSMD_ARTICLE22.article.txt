# Professor Show Returns.

### 
Professor A. B. Show arrived
home in August after an absence of
fifteen months, having spent a year
of that time in study on the con
tinent, chiefly at Leipzig. In his
travels Professor Show gave his
attention largely to churches and
art galleries. Arriving first in
England, he devoted a month to
Oxford, Cambridge, the art gal
leries and churches of London and
the Catholic towns. During two
weeks in Paris he visited the
Exposition and the Louvre. He
went through the cathedral at
Cologne, and remained six weeks
studying German in the Harz
mountains before taking up his
work at Leipzig. There for two
semesters he attended historical
lectures and the medieval his
torical seminary, in addition to
carrying on private investigations.
The Easter vacation Professor
Show spent in Rome, also visiting
Venice, Florence, Milan, and
smaller Italian cities. Upon re
turning home, he took the beautiful
trip from Leipzig to Cologne, down
the Rhine.
