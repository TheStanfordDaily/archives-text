# GRAND PIPE ORGAN.
## Description of the Ponderous Instrument to be Installed in the Memorial Chapel. 
### 
Two furniture cars were required
in which to ship the grand pipe
organ now being unloaded for in
stallation in the Memorial Chapel.
Mr. E. A. Spencer, who superin
tended its preparation for the Ep
worth League convention at Me
chanics Pavilion, has charge of the
work here. Fully one month will
be required for setting the ponder
ous instrument up in the gallery
above the entrance doors to the
Chapel. This is the largest and
most perfect organ ever built on the
Pacific Coast, and the largest elec
tric action instrument yet construct
ed west of Chicago. Mr. W.B.Flem
ing, formerly of the Roosevelt Or
gan Co., but now with the Murray
M. Harris Organ Co., is inventor of
the patents used. The following
description is published by the
manufacturers:
An examination of the specifica
tion will indicate the composition
of the instrument. A few words of
general description may be found
of interest, and serve to more clearly
define the position it occupies in the
art of organ building. It is with
out doubt one of the most complete
and perfect instruments, both me
chanically and musically, in the
country. It is a notable example
of the progress in the manufacture
of church organs,incident to the use
of electricity, and is the result of
the developments of an entirely
new principle in the application of
electricity to church organs. This
principle of construction is fully
covered by patents owned and con
trolled by the Murray M. Harris
Organ Co.
In architectural arrangement the
organ is divided into two equal por
tions, which will stand one in either
end of the large gallery of the Stan
ford Memorial Church, with an
intervening space of forty feet be
tween the two sections of the in
strument, thus permitting the dis
play of the magnificent memorial
window in the end of the church.
The console, or key desk, will be
forward in the front center of the
gallery about thirty feet from the
memorial window, and midway be
tween the two organs. In the in
tervening space so formed there
will be room for a choir of one
hundred and fifty voices. The lo
cation of the gallery is in the end
of the church over the entrance
doors nearly two hundred feet from
the chancel.
The organ, as erected in Me
chanics Pavilion, San Francisco,
for use in the International Ep
wortb League convention, had the
console extended, by means of ad
ditional electric cable, to the front
of the chorus, thus permitting the
organist to be in close touch with
the choral conductor. The electric
cable connecting the console with
the organ contains three hundred
and ninety-six wires, of an average
length of two hundred and twenty
feet. The total length of wire in
the entire organ, including the mag
nets, is thirty miles.
The action iH lighter in touch
than a grand piano, and has a mar
velous capacity for repetition, be
ing capable of greater rapidity in
speech than the quickest human
touch can produce. With the con
tact made by depressing a key, the
current is completed through one of
the small insulating wires of the

connecting cable with the magnet
inside the organ, which in turn
operates the pneumatic motors sup
plying wind to the pipes. The same
principle applies to the stop action,
couplers, combination action, and
also to the swell shades.
The two bellows, of one hundred
and twenty square feet area, are
blown by a three and one-half
horsepower electric motor. The
total weight of the organ is about
twenty-five tons. The price is $15-
500. The case is of quarter-sawed
eastern white oak, antique finish.
The front pipes, ninety-six in num
ber, are of pure block tin, polished,
having the appearance of burnished
silver.
