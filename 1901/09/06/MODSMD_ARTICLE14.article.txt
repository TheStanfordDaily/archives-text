An interesting situation is re
vealed by the figures at the close
of (lie third day of registration.
Last year one-third of the .students
were from other states; this year
all hut ninety, or less than one
eighth of the seven hundred and
sixty old students who had re
turned up to that time, registered
from California. In other words,
most of those who have previously
attended the University, although
they may have come from other
states, have been able to establish
a residence here, thus escaping the
payment of the registration fee
from which Californians alone are
now exempt.
Upon the other hand, eighty
eight, or almost precisely one
third of two hundred and sixty-six
new students entering, come from
outside. They, of course, have
been unable to establish a citizen
ship here. This shows beyond
doubt that the actual cosmopolitan
make-up of the student body ex
ists in the same ratio, although the
annual statistics cannot show it.
Out of a registration of l(W(i last
evening, only 178 claimed resi
dence outside of California. The
revenue from such a percentage is
small. Is this revenue, in view of
the relief from the burden of tax
ation, worth the cosmopolitan
reputation of which Stanford has
always been so proud?
