# OUR ATHLETICS EMPERILED.
## Faculty Committee Says Treasurer Nourse Is Disqualified. Nourse Refuses to Resign. 
### 
Yesterday Captain Fisher of the
football team received the following
notification, which is self-explan
atory:
Stanford University, Sept. 7.
Mr. Ralph 8. Fisher, Stanford Un
iversity.
Pear Sir: —In view of the situa
tion set forth in a letter to the pres
ident of the Associated Students,
and in a resolution of the Execu
tive Committee thereto, copies of
which are attached to this, you are
hereby instructed by the Committee
on Student Affairs to assume the
management of the athletic inter
ests of the University, to control
the collection and disbursement of
funds, and to take charge of the
property of the Associated Stu
dents.
in the exercise of powers con
ferred, you are to be independent
of control of the officers of the As
sociated Students, until instructed
to relinquish authority to a prop
erly qualified treasurer.
It is understood that in athletic
matters you are to act under the
direction of the Faculty Committee
on Athletics. R. L. Green,
Chairman Committee on
Student Affairs.
Attached to this notice were the
letters addressed to President Mc
Cormick and presented to a meet
ing of the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students last Thurs
day evening, and the resolutions
drawn up by the committee at that
time setting forth reasons for its
failure to act in accordance with
the request.
Below are the letter and resolu
tions:
Letter to President McCormick.
Stanford University, Sept. 5.
To the President of the student
body.
My Dear Sir: —As there is some
misapprehension concerning the
status of Mr. Nourse, 1 send this
statement for the information of
yourself and of any officers of the
Associated Students whom it may
concern.
Mr. Nourse was suspended by
the Committee on Scholarship at
the end of last semester. The
Committee on Student Affairs
prompti}' called Mr. Nourse's at
tention to the policy, of several
years' standing, which forbids stu
dents under suspension from taking
active part in student affairs; and
informed him that committee
could not consent to his continu
ance in the office of treasurer
while under suspension. The
proper officials of the Associated
Students were also informed offi
cially of the situation, in order
that they might take any action
necessary. As (he time until com
mencement was very limited, the
student body and its officers had
no adequate opportunity to deal
with the matter. In order that the
business might not be neglected
during vacation, to the detriment
of the Associated Students, Dr.

| Brainier authorized Mr. Nourse to
serve until the University should
open in September, before which
date it was impossible for the As
i sociated Students to act.
The case was reviewed on Sep
tember 3d, by the entire Committee
on Student Affairs, and the unani
mous conclusion reached that no
change in the former action should
be made. Very truly yours,
R. L. Green,
Chairman Committe on
Student Affairs.
Resolution of the Executive Com
mittee.
Resolved: That the Executive
' Committee of the student body in
executive session deplores the fact
that there has been any misunder
standing between the officers of the
Associated Students and the Com
mittee on Student Affairs; but after
jdue consultation it deems it unwise
to take any action in the matter of
student body treasurer, believing
j as it dods that, so far as the stu-
J dents are concerned, Mr. Nourse
holds his position legitimately, and
that any further action on its part
j would be in excess of its au
thority.

The whole controversy was
brought to a crisis by this final
step of the faculty committee. It
means simply, that, if the students
wish to conduct athletics, they
must accept the authority of Fisher
until a treasurer satisfactory to the
committee is chosen, and Nourse
has relinquished his position, or
I they must abandon football and
j everything else this season. Nourse
i has taken the position that his
j election occurred before his suspen
sion, that his name was acceptable
at the time he was chosen, that he
is a regular graduate student, not
compelled to take work under the
arrangement this year, and that
the faculty has no authority to
i force the Associated Students to vi
olate a contract with him, made for
j one year, while he has not violated
his part of the agreement with the
association. He maintains that he
worked all summer in order to get
. things in shape for this season, al
! though his term and salary did not
begin until September. He has
made contracts for coaches, train
ers, grounds, etc., aggregating $6,-
1000, which he says will be abro
gated by his removal.
This is the situation. The func
tions of the officers and organiza
tion of the student body are nulli
fied until the faculty's request is
fulfilled. Unless Nourse recedes, it
looks as though the athletic season
will be seriously crippled. He is
custodian of nil property and para
phernalia, yet nothing can be re
ceived at his hands without violat
ing the faculty decree, which is in

exorable. Nourse is today making
an effort to have the Committee on
Scholarship remove the suspension,
in view of the circumstances under
which he dropped his work last
spring.
Amendment Drawn Up.
At ( J:l5 this morning the Execu
tive Committee of the Associated
Students met to review the situa
tion. When called upon to act
last week it felt impotent to do any
thing because Nourse had not vio
lated his contract. Today it real
ized its impotency more forcibly,
since the summary action of the
faculty, and it took the only alter
native left by drawing up and post
ing the following amendment to
Article 111, Section 3, of the Con
stitution, which will be voted on
September 16th, one week from to
day. The amendment is intro
duced after the clause "to fill all
vacancies occurring in offices of the
association," and it reads that the
Executive Committee shall have
power "to remove any officer of the
association on account of gross mis
conduct in office, or when the gen
eral interests of the association de
mand it."
In the meantime, Captain Fisher
assumes the responsibility for foot
ball practices, which begin tomor
row evening.

will be seriously crippled. He is
custodian of nil property and para
phernalia, yet nothing can be re
ceived at his hands without violat
ing the faculty decree, which is in

exorable. Nourse is today making
an effort to have the Committee on
Scholarship remove the suspension,
in view of the circumstances under
which he dropped his work last
spring.
Amendment Drawn Up.
At ( J:l5 this morning the Execu
tive Committee of the Associated
Students met to review the situa
tion. When called upon to act
last week it felt impotent to do any
thing because Nourse had not vio
lated his contract. Today it real
ized its impotency more forcibly,
since the summary action of the
faculty, and it took the only alter
native left by drawing up and post
ing the following amendment to
Article 111, Section 3, of the Con
stitution, which will be voted on
September 16th, one week from to
day. The amendment is intro
duced after the clause "to fill all
vacancies occurring in offices of the
association," and it reads that the
Executive Committee shall have
power "to remove any officer of the
association on account of gross mis
conduct in office, or when the gen
eral interests of the association de
mand it."
In the meantime, Captain Fisher
assumes the responsibility for foot
ball practices, which begin tomor
row evening.
Yesterday Captain Fisher of the
football team received the following
notification, which is self-explan
atory:
Stanford University, Sept. 7.
Mr. Ralph 8. Fisher, Stanford Un
iversity.
Pear Sir: —In view of the situa
tion set forth in a letter to the pres
ident of the Associated Students,
and in a resolution of the Execu
tive Committee thereto, copies of
which are attached to this, you are
hereby instructed by the Committee
on Student Affairs to assume the
management of the athletic inter
ests of the University, to control
the collection and disbursement of
funds, and to take charge of the
property of the Associated Stu
dents.
in the exercise of powers con
ferred, you are to be independent
of control of the officers of the As
sociated Students, until instructed
to relinquish authority to a prop
erly qualified treasurer.
It is understood that in athletic
matters you are to act under the
direction of the Faculty Committee
on Athletics. R. L. Green,
Chairman Committee on
Student Affairs.
Attached to this notice were the
letters addressed to President Mc
Cormick and presented to a meet

the Associated Students last Thurs
day evening, and the resolutions
drawn up by the committee at that
time setting forth reasons for its
failure to act in accordance with
the request.

Letter to President McCormick.
Stanford University, Sept. 5.
To the President of the student
body.
My Dear Sir: —As there is some
misapprehension concerning the
status of Mr. Nourse, 1 send this
statement for the information of
yourself and of any officers of the
Associated Students whom it may
concern.
Mr. Nourse was suspended by
the Committee on Scholarship at
the end of last semester. The
Committee on Student Affairs
prompti}' called Mr. Nourse's at
tention to the policy, of several
years' standing, which forbids stu
dents under suspension from taking
active part in student affairs; and
informed him that committee
could not consent to his continu
ance in the office of treasurer
while under suspension. The
proper officials of the Associated
Students were also informed offi
cially of the situation, in order
that they might take any action
necessary. As (he time until com
mencement was very limited, the
student body and its officers had
no adequate opportunity to deal
with the matter. In order that the
business might not be neglected
during vacation, to the detriment
of the Associated Students, Dr.

| Brainier authorized Mr. Nourse to
serve until the University should
open in September, before which
date it was impossible for the As
i sociated Students to act.
The case was reviewed on Sep
tember 3d, by the entire Committee
on Student Affairs, and the unani
mous conclusion reached that no
change in the former action should
be made. Very truly yours,
R. L. Green,
Chairman Committe on
Student Affairs.
Resolution of the Executive Com
mittee.
Resolved: That the Executive
' Committee of the student body in
executive session deplores the fact
that there has been any misunder
standing between the officers of the
Associated Students and the Com
mittee on Student Affairs; but after
jdue consultation it deems it unwise
to take any action in the matter of
student body treasurer, believing
j as it dods that, so far as the stu-
J dents are concerned, Mr. Nourse
holds his position legitimately, and
that any further action on its part
j would be in excess of its au
thority.

The whole controversy was
brought to a crisis by this final
step of the faculty committee. It
means simply, that, if the students
wish to conduct athletics, they
must accept the authority of Fisher
until a treasurer satisfactory to the
committee is chosen, and Nourse
has relinquished his position, or
I they must abandon football and
j everything else this season. Nourse
i has taken the position that his
j election occurred before his suspen
sion, that his name was acceptable
at the time he was chosen, that he
is a regular graduate student, not
compelled to take work under the
arrangement this year, and that
the faculty has no authority to
i force the Associated Students to vi
olate a contract with him, made for
j one year, while he has not violated
his part of the agreement with the
association. He maintains that he
worked all summer in order to get
. things in shape for this season, al
! though his term and salary did not
begin until September. He has
made contracts for coaches, train
ers, grounds, etc., aggregating $6,-
1000, which he says will be abro
gated by his removal.
This is the situation. The func
tions of the officers and organiza
tion of the student body are nulli
fied until the faculty's request is
fulfilled. Unless Nourse recedes, it
looks as though the athletic season
will be seriously crippled. He is
custodian of nil property and para
phernalia, yet nothing can be re
