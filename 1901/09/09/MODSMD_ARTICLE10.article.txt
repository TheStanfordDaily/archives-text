Seven hundred and sixty old
students had returned to the Uni
versity at the close of yesterday's
registration. On the third day
last year 776 had registered. The
class of 1901 was the largest ever
graduated and it would not have
been surprising, for this reason, if
the falling off had been greater
than sixteen. In view of the heavy
depletion by the outgoing class
last spring, the number who are
back is convincing and surprising
proof of the loyalty of the Stanford
student.
While there are hut 266 Fresh
men, compared with 825 last fall,
the increase to fifteen entrance
credits has just gone into force, and
the requirements have been made
more stringent. The present class
is 82 per cent the size of its prede
cessors. The examination papers,
especially those in English compo
sition, are reported to be the best
ever submitted. Entering students
give promise of proving unusually
strong in both scholarship and
athletics. This is probably due
to the advanced entrance require
ments. At any rate, the confident
prophecy made last spring by some
outsiders that there would be a
heavy bolt of students because of
resignations in the faculty, has been
negatived.
