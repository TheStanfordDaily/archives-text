The fact that an attempt has
been made bo early in the year to re
organize the University Orchestra
should he appreciated by every

music loving student in the Uni
versity. The University is sorely
in need of a good orchestra: one
that is capable of making real
music. Every student who can
play at all should come to the
practice and assist in lending
spirit, at least, to the organization.
