The shops of the Mechanical En
gineering department have been
renovated and put in perfect shape
during the past summer. The room
formerly used for assaying in the
brick shop to the west is now being
remodeled for a mechanical labora
tory, in which will be carried on
boiler testing. Specifications are
under preparation for a full equip
ment of the laboratory. Quarters
for assaying have been built adjoin
ing the new Chemistry building.
General wood-working,now known
as manual training, will be con
ducted as formerly under the di
rection of Mr. Soule in the second
story of the brick Engineering build
ing. Wood-working and pattern
making for Mechanical Engineers
have been separated from this
branch and will occupy the lower
door of the same building. Mr.
Stanley, formerly of the Union Iron
Works, will have charge of this de
partment.
Several new buildings are to be
constructed in the near future.

ty liecorder this week which aggre
