# MOULTON HERE.
## Celebrated Coach and Trainer Arrived Last Night to Take Charge of Our Athletes. 
### 
E. U. Moil I ton, who will train
Stanford's athletes during the com
ing year, arrived on the campus
last night. The celebrated coach
is a large, gray-haired man, in gray
clothes and a golf cap. He has the
"sprinter's stoop" in his shoulders,
and gives the impression of inex
haustible nervous energy.
In the course of conversation to
day "Dad " expressed his surprise
and pleasure in finding so many
large and well developed men
among our athletes. He said: "1
find you have a splendid lot of big
huskies here, and I can't see wiiy
we oughtn't to develop a great team
out of them. lam a firm believer
in the developing of men for their
events. One man properly devel
oped and made into a good runner
or juniper or shot-putter is of four
times greater value to a school than
the natural athlete who needs little
development. The track men will
start work here as soon as possible,
but during the hot weather we shall
not work very hard. The work
will, of course, gradually get harder
during the year."
It is expected that Moulton will
have supervision of the training
tables and of the general health of
all Stanford athletes — football,
baseball and track men—but that
be will give his special attention to
the track team.
