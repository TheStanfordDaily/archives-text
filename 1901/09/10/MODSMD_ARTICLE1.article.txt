# FOOTBALL MEETING
## Men Signed Last Evening for Practice. Fickert, Fisher and Moulton Talk. 
### 
Last evening the first football
meeting of the year took place in
Encina club room. After the crowd
had gathered, Charles Fickert, head
graduate coach, mounted a table
and made a short address. He said
in substance: "The fun starts to
morrow, and we want to see every
body out. There will be good men
to welcome you and to put you
through: We want everybody to
do his best and to keep training
rules. The man who breaks these
rules must leave the team. We'll
have a hard season this year â€”one
monthless time, with harder teams
to buck. But 1 consider the pre
liminary with the Olympics and
Reliance and all the others simply
practice. 1 do not care especially
whether we win them or not; the
one we must win is the big game
Nov., 9th. And 1 think we will
win, although they're out for blood
across the bay, and we've no cinch."
Captain Fisher responded to calls
for a speech and said that the main
object of the meeting was simply
to get the men to sign the lists, so
that the coaches could see what new
men were out and what old men
would try for positions. Both
Fisher and Fickert were heartily
cheered.
"Dad" Moulton then said in part:
"1 am glad to see so much enthusi
asm here and to find so much col
lege spirit. That is what we need,
for we have lots of good material
and only have to train it. You will
be surprised to learn that the Stan
ford team is well and favorably
known throughout the entire East;
and on the Coast this is the only
college they talk about. Why, they
never heard of Berkeley in the East
at all. If anything goes wrong
with you 1 want you to be sure to
come to me first and I'll help you
all I can. I intend to give every
man my individual attention. It
is considered, by the way, where I
have been, a very great honor for a
man to make any of the college
teams, or even to try for them. If
you break training rules you will
lose your position, and that is the
greatest disgrace that can happen
to any college man."
As soon as the applause had died
away, Professor Lowers addressed
the crowd and spoke briefly, urging
the need of good, clean football,
and saying that this year, if Stan
ford wins by a fluke, it will be by
a series of them, a series of most
remarkable flukes. He was warm
ly applauded. Up to date the fol
lowing old men have signed up:
