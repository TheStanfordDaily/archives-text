# UNIVERSITY SERMON
## An Interesitng Address by Rev. J.K. McLean, on Sentiment, Conviction and Moral Principle. 
### 
The University sermon of Sun
day morning was preached by Rev.
J.K. McLean of Oakland, Cal. The
reading was from the thirtieth chap
ter of St. John. In his introduc
tory remarks Dr. McLean spoke of
the calamity which had overfallen
the nation, the third time that it.
has occurred in our history. He
stated that it is a calamity at best,
even if the assassin's shot had gone
wild that, in America, the home of
the free, the hand of the assassin
should he lifted against the Chief
Magistrate. Dr. McLean touched
on the sympathy expressed from
not only the people of our nation,
hut from different parts of the world
which had learned of the sad catas
trophe. He touched briefly on this
subject, as he said Dr. Jordan had
alreaily spoken of it in a previous
discourse.
The texts referred to by Dr. Mc-
Lean were the 37th Psalm, 11th
verse, and the 119 th Psalm, 11th
verse, the three topics spoken of
being sentiment, conviction and
moral principle. Dr. McLean stated
that sentiment was a good thing for
every person to have, especially re
ligious sentiment. He went on to
say that even the most ignoble men
are worked up to a high pitch of
sentiment sometime in the course of
their life, expressing high ideals,
pure purposes, something which has
touched them for the moment, caus
ing them to breathe out thoughts
which they failed to follow after the
impulse had left them.
Conviction was treated as a high
er plane of thought than sentiment.
The religions conviction is what a
man firmly believes inâ€”knows to
be true, but not always followed.
Moral principle was considered
by Dr. McLean to be the', highest
form of the three, that which ele
vates all that religious conviction
can do, the climax which leads up
to a purer form of life.
He stated that after our aca
demic course here had been com
pleted, to still carry moral princi
ples in our lives and hearts, to fol
low the model of The Perfect Man,
to take examples from the life of
St. Paul, and that we may enjoy a
well rounded life by so doing; thus
representing the type of christian
gentleman and gentlewomen.
The special music for the morn
ing service was furnished by the
chapel choir and a tenor solo ren
dered by Dr. Little.
