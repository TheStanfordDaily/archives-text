# Changes at the Power-House.
## 
### 
As soon as the high-potential
transformers arrive from the East,
the electric current which now sup
plies the campus and which comes
from the Redwood plant, will he
turned off, and the power will he
furnished hy a company having its
power-house at Colgate, near Ma
rysville, on the Yuba River, which
there has a fall of some 800 feet.
The current comes by cable south
through Vallejo, crosses the Car
quinez Straits by a cable suspended
high above all the shipping, goes
across the country to Oakland; sup
plying that and adjacent points,
and going south around bay,
furnishes San Jose with 46,000
volts. This line is now between
San Mateo and San Francisco, its
ultimate destination. The plant at
Colgate produces 15,000 horse
power, and can easily produce 80,-
000 more. The rumor that power
was to be furnished by the Blue
Lakes Co. is denied.
The crude oil tanks, the excava
tions for which are now being dug
to the south of the power-house, are
to be 14 feet deep by 16 feet in di
ameter and are expected to contain
over 16,000 gallons of petroleum.
This will be forced into the burn
ing apparatus in the engine room,
where it will be converted into
spray and ignited. The machinery
for this will arrive soon from the
city. The new fuel is said to be
cheaper, cleaner and handier than
coal, and discoveries of its utility
are being made every day.
The power-house plant will in
the future be utilized for heating
purposes only, but the electrical
machinery will be retained in case
of emergency.
