# FOOTBALL RULES.
## Changes as Announced by the Rules Committee of the National Football Association. 
### 
Following is an Associated Press
dispatch giving the changes in foot
ball rules for this season:
Nkw York, Sept. 9. —The Rules
Committee of the National Football
Association has announced the
rules for the coming season. The
committee is composed of Paul
Dashell of the United States Naval
Academy, Alexander Moffett of
Princeton, John C. Bell of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, L. M. Den
nis of Cornell, and Walter Camp of
Yale. Very few important changes
were made. The most important
change is in the definition of a
"safety." It is provided that "a
safety" is made when the ball,
kicked by a man behind his goal
line, crosses the extension of the
side line behind the goal line.
Another change of importance is
in the rule which provides that no
delay for any purpose whatever
shall continue over two minutes,
under penalty of five yards for any
further delay, however slight, or
the forfeiture of the game, if de
layed another two minutes.
The exact alterations which have
been made in the rules this season
by the committee are as follows,
according to Spalding's Guide:
In Rule 4 of the Guide, section
(d), there is a farther definition of
a safety, namely, that a safety is
made when the ball, kicked by a
man behind his goal line, crosses
the extension of the side line be
hind the goal line. It was gen
erally supposed that the rules did
not provide for such a contingency,
but, as a matter of fact, they did.
When a man, standing behind his
own goal, attempted to kick the
ball out and made such a poor
kick of it that, the ball did not
cross his goal line at all, but

crossed what would be the exten
sion of the side line and thus went
into touch, by the existing rules
the ball was dead as soon as it
crossed the side line. But also by
another rule when the ball was
kicked out of bounds it did not go
to the man who first obtained pos
session of it, but to the opponents.
Hence a kick of this kind would
result in the opponents having
possession of the ball in touch.
But then they must bring it to the
point where the side line was
crossed by the ball and there put
it in play. The result would be
that they would bring it down be
hind the kicker's goal, and immedi
ately upon putting it in play
there, they would hold it on the
ground and thus secure a touch
down. In other words, a ball
which kicked by a man behind his
own goal line did not cross the
goal line, but crossed the side line,
meant, if the rules were followed
out, a touchdown for the oppon
ents. This seemed rather a severe
penalty for the misplay, and it was
determined by the Rules Commit
tee that such a play should be
ruled a safety instead of a touch
down for the opponents. Hence
the new rule. The second altera
tion is under Rule 10 of the Guide,
Note. This formerly defined
"ahead of the ball" as "between the
opponents' goal and a line paral
lel to the goal line and passing
through the center of the ball."
As a matter of fact, this was in
consistent with some of the other
rules, where the forward point of
the ball is taken as the line. The
rule was therefore altered so that
instead of reading as it did in the
former edition, it read, "passing
through the point of the ball near
est the goal line of the side not in
possession of the ball."
The next alteration occurs in
Rule 12 of the Guide, Section (e).
The difficulty that caused the alter
ation in this rule has not been ap
preciated very much in the big
games in the East, but there have
been occasions even there where the
delay of the game was prolonged
unreasonably. As a matter of fact
it was found that although the
Rules Committee intended that no
delay should result over the two
minutes, an obstreperous team
would make it more nearly four
minutes, in this way: Acting un
der Rule 12 (e) that no delay aris
ing from any cause whatsoever
should continue more than two
minutes, they would delay, suppos
edly for the injured player, for the
full two minutes. Then the referee
would tell them time was up, and
they must play. But they would
manage to occupy nearly two min
utes longer by refusing to play,
claiming under Rule '28, Section
(g), that the referee could not give
the game forfeit to the other side
until fully two minutes after he
had ordered them to play. Just
before the expiration of the fourth
minute they would play. With
this contention in mind, the Rules
Committee added to Rule 12, Sec
tion (e), the following: "Any delay
thereafter shall be penalized under
Rule 27 (e),28 (c)." It means that
after the consumption of two min
utes, five yards shall be given for

further delay of tiie game, this in
no way interfering with the ref
eree's making them forfeit the game
at the end of two minutes of such
delay. In other words, they will
lose the distance for delay as well
as forfeit the game if they do not go
on at the end of two minutes
more.
Rule 13, Section (d), lirst line,
the word " kick" is changed to read
"punt or drop kick" for further
clearness.
Rule 14, Section (b), the words
are inserted after the words "fair
catch": "when kicked after touch
ing the ball in at the side line."
This was an omission in the former
rules.
Under Rule 17 there hns been
added to Section (a),"any such in
terference shall be regarded as de
lay of the game." Rule 28 (c).
This was to insure the abandon
ment of pulling and hauling the
opponents in the rush line.
Rule 21 of the Guide, Section(b),
the following clause was added:
" Unless this should result to the
advantage of the offending side,
when the down and the distance to
he made shall remain the same."
It is clear that this is what was in
tended in former rulings, but it had
not been made definite enough.
Rule 22, Section (a), before the
word "or," are inserted the words
"at least ten yards." That is, a
man touching the ball at right
angles to the side line and thus
putting it in play by a kick, must
kick it at least ten yards.
Rule 25, to Section (a) was
added the clause providing that the
referee shall make a signal with
his hand when a team is trying for
goal immediately upon the touch
ing of the ball to the ground. This
has been the custom of officials for
some time, but has never been
clearly stated in the rules.
Rule 28, Section (d), paragraph
2, the words "is attempting to"
were changed to "has opportunity
for,"in order that the official should
judge when there was a real chance
of a man making a fair catch.
Rule 28, Section (k), has been
altered so as to make the rule
broader and make it apply to any
kind of unsportsmanlike conduct
not elsewhere provided for.
This completes the list of altera
tions, and, as will be seen, there is
very little that affects the play
directly.

But then they must bring it to the
point where the side line was
crossed by the ball and there put
it in play. The result would be
that they would bring it down be
hind the kicker's goal, and immedi
ately upon putting it in play
there, they would hold it on the
ground and thus secure a touch
down. In other words, a ball
which kicked by a man behind his
own goal line did not cross the
goal line, but crossed the side line,
meant, if the rules were followed
out, a touchdown for the oppon
ents. This seemed rather a severe
penalty for the misplay, and it was
determined by the Rules Commit
tee that such a play should be
ruled a safety instead of a touch
down for the opponents. Hence
the new rule. The second altera
tion is under Rule 10 of the Guide,
Note. This formerly defined
"ahead of the ball" as "between the
opponents' goal and a line paral
lel to the goal line and passing
through the center of the ball."
As a matter of fact, this was in
consistent with some of the other
rules, where the forward point of
the ball is taken as the line. The
rule was therefore altered so that
instead of reading as it did in the
former edition, it read, "passing
through the point of the ball near
est the goal line of the side not in
possession of the ball."
The next alteration occurs in
Rule 12 of the Guide, Section (e).
The difficulty that caused the alter
ation in this rule has not been ap
preciated very much in the big
games in the East, but there have
been occasions even there where the
delay of the game was prolonged
unreasonably. As a matter of fact
it was found that although the
Rules Committee intended that no
delay should result over the two
minutes, an obstreperous team
would make it more nearly four
minutes, in this way: Acting un
der Rule 12 (e) that no delay aris
ing from any cause whatsoever
should continue more than two
minutes, they would delay, suppos
edly for the injured player, for the
full two minutes. Then the referee
would tell them time was up, and
they must play. But they would
manage to occupy nearly two min
utes longer by refusing to play,
claiming under Rule '28, Section
(g), that the referee could not give
the game forfeit to the other side
until fully two minutes after he
had ordered them to play. Just
before the expiration of the fourth
minute they would play. With
this contention in mind, the Rules
Committee added to Rule 12, Sec
tion (e), the following: "Any delay
thereafter shall be penalized under
Rule 27 (e),28 (c)." It means that
after the consumption of two min
utes, five yards shall be given for

further delay of tiie game, this in
no way interfering with the ref
eree's making them forfeit the game
at the end of two minutes of such
delay. In other words, they will
lose the distance for delay as well
as forfeit the game if they do not go
on at the end of two minutes
more.
Rule 13, Section (d), lirst line,
the word " kick" is changed to read
"punt or drop kick" for further
clearness.
Rule 14, Section (b), the words
are inserted after the words "fair
catch": "when kicked after touch
ing the ball in at the side line."
This was an omission in the former
rules.
Under Rule 17 there hns been
added to Section (a),"any such in
terference shall be regarded as de
lay of the game." Rule 28 (c).
This was to insure the abandon
ment of pulling and hauling the
opponents in the rush line.
Rule 21 of the Guide, Section(b),
the following clause was added:
" Unless this should result to the
advantage of the offending side,
when the down and the distance to
he made shall remain the same."
It is clear that this is what was in
tended in former rulings, but it had
not been made definite enough.
Rule 22, Section (a), before the
word "or," are inserted the words
"at least ten yards." That is, a
man touching the ball at right
angles to the side line and thus
putting it in play by a kick, must
kick it at least ten yards.
Rule 25, to Section (a) was
added the clause providing that the
referee shall make a signal with
his hand when a team is trying for
goal immediately upon the touch
ing of the ball to the ground. This
has been the custom of officials for
some time, but has never been
clearly stated in the rules.
Rule 28, Section (d), paragraph
2, the words "is attempting to"
were changed to "has opportunity
for,"in order that the official should
judge when there was a real chance
of a man making a fair catch.
Rule 28, Section (k), has been
altered so as to make the rule
broader and make it apply to any
kind of unsportsmanlike conduct
not elsewhere provided for.
This completes the list of altera
tions, and, as will be seen, there is
very little that affects the play
directly.
Following is an Associated Press
dispatch giving the changes in foot
ball rules for this season:
Nkw York, Sept. 9. —The Rules
Committee of the National Football
Association has announced the
rules for the coming season. The
committee is composed of Paul
Dashell of the United States Naval
Academy, Alexander Moffett of
Princeton, John C. Bell of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, L. M. Den
nis of Cornell, and Walter Camp of
Yale. Very few important changes
were made. The most important
change is in the definition of a
"safety." It is provided that "a
safety" is made when the ball,
kicked by a man behind his goal
line, crosses the extension of the
side line behind the goal line.
Another change of importance is
in the rule which provides that no
delay for any purpose whatever
shall continue over two minutes,
under penalty of five yards for any
further delay, however slight, or
the forfeiture of the game, if de
layed another two minutes.
The exact alterations which have
been made in the rules this season
by the committee are as follows,
according to Spalding's Guide:
In Rule 4 of the Guide, section
(d), there is a farther definition of
a safety, namely, that a safety is
made when the ball, kicked by a
man behind his goal line, crosses
the extension of the side line be
hind the goal line. It was gen
erally supposed that the rules did
not provide for such a contingency,
but, as a matter of fact, they did.
When a man, standing behind his
own goal, attempted to kick the
ball out and made such a poor
kick of it that, the ball did not
cross his goal line at all, but

crossed what would be the exten
sion of the side line and thus went
into touch, by the existing rules
the ball was dead as soon as it
crossed the side line. But also by
another rule when the ball was
kicked out of bounds it did not go
to the man who first obtained pos
session of it, but to the opponents.
Hence a kick of this kind would
result in the opponents having
possession of the ball in touch.
But then they must bring it to the
point where the side line was
crossed by the ball and there put
it in play. The result would be
that they would bring it down be
hind the kicker's goal, and immedi
ately upon putting it in play
there, they would hold it on the
ground and thus secure a touch
down. In other words, a ball
which kicked by a man behind his
own goal line did not cross the
goal line, but crossed the side line,
