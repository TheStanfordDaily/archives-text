No material change is made in
the football rules this season. The
revision of the definition for a
"safety" gives a fairer chance to
the defensive side in protecting its
goal. The stringent enforcement
of the rule forbidding a delay of
more than two minutes from any
cause, will do away with unneces
sary impediment of the game by
men playing for wind. Although
this has been the purpose of the
rule heretofore, its enforcement
could not be made rigid. Other
changes are merely to make specific
what was formerly understood.
