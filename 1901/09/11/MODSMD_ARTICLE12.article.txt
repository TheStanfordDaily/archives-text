With no spirit of animosity to
ward Mr. Nourse, the Daily Palo
Alto feels that the time is at hand
for an expression of the sentiment of
the student body. Although under
suspension by the faculty, —which
holds absolute power over all of us
registered for work, and which can
suspend or expel any of us who
violates its rulings, —Mr. Nourse re
fuses to step out of a position that
jeopardizes our football season. We
are forbidden to recognize him in
his official capacity, and yet he
will not relinquish the property of
which he is custodian. A continu
ance of ibis attitude, although he
may hold the technical legal ad
vantage, will stultify a record of
long and faithful service aw a loyal
student of Stanford.
John T. Nourse has held respon
sible class and student body po
sitions, has been editor-in-chief of
the Daily Palo Alto, has worked
faithfully and untiringly for the
honor of Stanford both on the track
and gridiron. His fellow students
have recognized his faithfulness by
honoring him with the position to
which he was elected last spring.
Under the present circumstances,
however, there is no question but
that the student body as a
whole believes Mr. Nourse should
resign his position and relieve us
from this embarrassing situation.
If he fails to do this, and his atti
tude in any way cripples the short
football season now upon us, the
enviable record of loyalty which he
has made for himself will be swal
lowed into oblivion by the indigna
tion that is sure to fall upon him.
If Mr. Nourse is afraid to relin
quish his hold because of the dan
ger of losing compensation for the
work he did last summer, he is
making a serious mistake. If the
Executive Committee were inclined
to refuse to make an appropriation
sufficient to reimburse him for his
time and labor, it could not with
stand the public sentiment which

will demand this reimbursement.
If, however, Mr. Nourse takes the
case into the courts, as has been
intimated, and cripples the athletic
season, he will meet a firm deter
mination to litigate the matter to
the end. This will not only lessen
his chances of recompense, but,
after the expense of a lawsuit that
may be continued over a long
period of time before final decision
is given, whatever judgment he
might secure would be largely con
sumed.
Mr. Nourse, you may command
the honor and respect of all your
fellow-students by making a tem
porary personal sacrifice which
will in reality prove advantageous
to you; you may command the ill
will and indignation of every stu
dent and friend of Stanford. We
await your decision.
