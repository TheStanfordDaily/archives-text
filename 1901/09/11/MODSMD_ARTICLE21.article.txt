# SUNDAY EVENING SERVICE.
## Dr. McClish Delivers the Address to the Christian Associations in the Chapel. 
### 
The first Sunday evening service
given by the Christian Associations
had a most interesting speaker in
the person of Dr. Eli McClish,
president of the University of the
Pacific. Dr. McClish opened the
service with a reading from the
Epistle to the Ephesians. He
stated that he was embarrassed in
selecting a topic, but spoke broadly
on religion, without reference to
creed.
Before his nineteenth year Dr.
McClish had never been to Sunday
school, and had never been to
church fifty times before he was
twenty. He served in the Civil
War from the tenth day of June
1864, until the first of September.
During the war he was a close stu
dent of the four gospels, and in
that way gained much religious
knowledge.
He referred to Miss Helen
Keller, who has entered Harvard
College, being deaf, dumb, and
blind. It was thought well to see
if she had any knowledge of Cod,
so Phillips Brooks was sent to her
to ask the question through her
teacher. The reply was, "1 knew
God, but didn't know his name."
Darwin and his wonderful gift
to civilization were spoken of: how
in youth the Brazilian forests along
the Amazon impressed him with
the wonders of nature's God, how
in later years devotion along one
line of study had caused him to
lose his appreciation for art, litera
ture, music, painting, and even re
ligion, so that he confessed himself
an agnostic but not an infidel.
Dr. McClish stated that science,
art, literature, institutions, and
religion are the heritage the world
has left us, and that we cannot en
ter deeply into any one unless we
are in sympathy with religion. Il
lustrations of this truth were given
from the lives and works of Tenny
son, Whittier, Agassiz, Drummond,
and other leaders in literary and
scientific thought.
