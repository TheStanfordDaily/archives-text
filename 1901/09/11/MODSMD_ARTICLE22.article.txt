# Dr. Jordan Sunday Evening.

President Jordan spoke last Sun
day evening in the. Methodist
church, Palo Alto, taking as his
text Matthew vxiii, 7: "It must
needs he that offenses come, but
woe to him hy whom the offense
cometh." He said in part:
"Offenses are inevitable, but this
does not excuse the one who causes
them; for, when a certain act is in
evitable, it means that the oppor
tunity for wrong exists, and woe
unto him who does not refuse it.
Heroism is simply standing out
against the inevitable. Heredity is
no excuse for sin; nor is tempta
tion —nature knows only the fact.
"That it is inevitable that the
fool and his money are soon parted,
and that it is inevitable that there
will lie sweat-shops, and dives, and
saloons, are no excuses for you to
rob the fool, to own a sweat-shop,
or to rent your building for saloons,
sweat-shops or dives.
"I can get along without the re
spect of my neighbors; 1 cannot get
along without the respect of Num
ber One, when my conscience re
proaches me for the wrong I have
done. Injustice always has a hard
ening, deadening, degrading reac
tion. The slave through all the
ages has his revenge on the slave
driver. In all wrongs God is no

respecter of persons —woe unto him
by whom offense cometh."
"In the republic there should be
no governing class; there should be
no arraying of class against class —
union class against capital class,
for this tends to make it no repub
lic at all. The great body of Ameri
cans are neither rich nor poor, and
it is of this class that the President
of these United States comes. This
is what makes him so beloved. In
dustrial war and bitterness, to
gether with crazy speeches and sen
sationalism, have caused this at
tempt to do murder.
"And so in the struggle for exist
ence, though some who are not well
fitted for the fight must go, the law
of mercy is merciless, and the law
of pity pitiless, and there is but one
irresistible tendency in the world,
the tendency to justice, sympathy,
and right. Because in long years
the Anglo-Saxon blood has produced
more than its share of the gentlest,
justest, humanest, and therefore
most heroic of men, I have infinite
faith in its future. And when it
ceases to be humane, just, and he
roic it shall perish from the face of
the earth. Among the unrecorded
sayings of Jesus are these words:
T burn with them that burn, with
them that are athirstl thirst. With
them that are sick I am sick, with
them that are hungry I am hun
gry.' This forms the basis for
sound national character just as for
the character of the individual
man."
