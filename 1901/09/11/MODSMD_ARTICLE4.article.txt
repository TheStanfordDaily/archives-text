# English-American Meet.
## 
### 
The Oxford-Cain bridge contest,
with Harvard-Yale will take place
sometime this month. The date
and place of meeting have not yet
been decided upon. Nine events
will be contested: the hundred-yard
dash; quarter-mile, half-mile, and
two-mile runs; the low hurdles; the
high and broad jumps; and the
hammer throw. Only first places
count. Two Englishmen and two
Americans will enter in each event.
The English team of twenty-two
men is strong. Thirteen of the men
are from Cambridge and nine from
Oxford. The American team is not
picked as yet, but the Harvard and
Yale men are in hard training, and
the best men of the two universities
will be chosen.
It is hard to pick the winners of
this meet. The English team is
easily superior in the half-mile,
mile, and two-mile runs, and the
Americans will take the hammer
throw, the high-jump, and the hur
dles. It is more than probable that
Hind of Cambridge, with a record
of 9 4-5, will take the hundred. In
order to secure first place the Ameri
cans must win both the quarter
and the broad jumps.
