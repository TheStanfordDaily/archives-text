Of the three monthly magazines
published west of the liocky Moun
tains two are to be found in the
library, and the latest numbers of
these contain articles of consider
able interest, especially to those
among us to whom the West —with
a capital letter —is unknown.
In the Sunset for August, pub
lished by the Southern Pacific Com

pany, are three well illustrated and
interesting descriptions of Califor
nia—one of Santa Barbara in De
cember, and two of the Sierra, and
in the same magazine are two very
readable articles, also illustrated,
on California's industries —"Seed
Farms of Santa Clara,"and"Grow
ing Tannic Plants and Trees."
Another article describing Cali
fornian industries is "San Joaquin
County and Stockton," in the Land
of Sunshine for July; and in the
same magazine is a description of
"Summer Resorts of Southern Cali
fornia," which those who were dis
appointed in not finding Stanford
in the tropics will do well to read.
These articles, with a long de
cription of Golden Gate Park, San
Francisco, in the single copy
(March, 1901) of the Overland
Monthly on our magazine shelf, —
which, by the way, contains a poem
by a Stanford student, —will serve
as a good introduction to California
for our new fellow workers.
