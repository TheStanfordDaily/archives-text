# LECTURE TO FRESHMEN.
## Dr. Jordan Speaks of a Student's Ideals and Purposes. 
### 
A large number of new and old
students and members of the
faculty were gathered together in
Assembly Hall to hear Dr. Jor
dan's address on "Student Ideals
and Purposes." Dr. Jordan said:
"The point is to tell the student
what is before him. The students
are not told what they are to do;
they are expected to find that out
for themselves.
"This place is yours; it was
made for you. The professors are
here for you. The whole place is
yours. You will find that out as
time goes on, and it is your fault
if you don't know about your pro
fessors.
"You are here to study, and we
can ask you to go home if you
don't do it. Be a student first of
all. You don't want to be a man
whose major subject is football.
"Keep your watch fifteen min
utes ahead. Know fifteen minutes
before it happens what is going to
happen. The most important rule
is 'to keep up your work,' so that if
you must give some time to
athletics, you will be ahead of your
class when you do so.
" Learn to do things right the
first time. The men who become
good scholars apply their minds to
the thing the first time, and when
they grasp a thing the first time
they don't need to go over and over
it again.
"The most important thing is
not to put too much time in study,
but grasp your subject at first.
"The first duty of a student is to I
be a student. If you are interested
in other things, you should go
where other things are. Be a
student first. It is an honor to be
a student. Carlyle says, in the
preface of one of his works, to the
reader: 'You are an achievement
of importance.' It will be an
honor for you to keep with the pro
cession, and the procession is made
of those who study.
" it is an honor to be a student,
and especially a Stanford student.
It is a sacrifice to come here. Your
father spends less money; your
mother goes without certain things;
so it is a sacrifice also on the part
of others.
"Some students, when sent home,
blame the faculty. The faculty
has made a great number of mis
takes, but it never has made that
mistake of judging wrongly of a
student.
" It costs $200 a year to support
each student. It is a gift of $800
for your college course; a gift that
should not be squandered.
" We want you to remember that
the first duty of a student is to be
a student. Have as good a time
as you can. Be loyal to the faculty
and everything that is connected
with the name of Stanford. Your
position should be, if you find
things wrong, turn in and make
them right. The large part of the
duty of the Alumni is that.
"I walked out with the president
of the oldest institution in
and the president showed me the
things he didn't like at Harvard.
"I don't like fun that is depend

ant on beer bottles. That kind of
fun makes a difference in the morn
ing. No kind of 'fun' is more
humiliating, more contemptible,
than hazing. It may do the young
fellow good, but the effects of
hazing are always bad.
"We don't like the 'fun' of
rushing. If injures University
property. There has been less in
jury to property here than else
where, but rushing is entirely
wrong. A great many things that
seem funny to the students are not
so funny when boiled down and
sent the round of the newspapers,
and that is one thing that you
should always keep in mind.
" Bismarck said that there were
three classes at college. 'One that
studied themselves to death; one
that drank themselves to death;
the third class, which did neither,
but in after years governed the
nation.' "
The lecture was brought, to a
close by Dr. Jordan reading a paper
of William L. Bryan's, a former
Stanford man, to a class of new
students, the most essential points
being: to eat well, take regular
hours for sleep, cultivate cheerful
ness, an interest in athletics, and
above all not "to burn the candle
at both ends."
