## Captain Fisher, Coach Fickert and Trainer Moulton on New Football Rules. 
### 
Captain Fisher said in an inter
view today concerning the new foot
ball rules: "There is a wonderful
change going on in modern football,
an evolution, which in the next few
years will eliminate the quarter
back, except as a man used to stop
up holes in the line. He will no
longer pass, for in my opinion, the
ball will be given directly to the
man who is to run with it. This
will obviate many unfortunate fum
bles. In a little while football will
become as scientific and as widely
played as baseball. I consider the
"safety" rule a good one, for there
has been a big dispute in every
game on the Coast whenever a safety
was made. This rule does away
with that trouble by clearly
defining the play. Another good
rule is that which provides a pen
alty for delay of over two minutes.
Under the old rule, a team in good
physical shape was often taken ad
vantage of by poorly-conditioned
players, who could hold the game
a long time. This has been done a
great deal by some of these athletic
clubs, whose men were poorly
trained. No games will be won
this season by men getting hurt
and taking out time." Captain
Fisher expressed himself as pleased
at the showing already made by
the squad. He said: "Every old
man on the campus has come out,
and there are lots of freshmen out.
Moreover, I never knew a more wil
ling set of fellows. I believe every
man out there will try his hardest
to do his work well. 1 think I am
safe in promising a trip to every
man who makes either the Varsity,
the second eleven, or the Freshman
team. The big team will go to
either Denver or Portland, and the
others to Salt Lake City, where the
second team will play that of the
University of Utah, and the Fresh
men the Salt Lake High. Both the
latter teams have made proposi
tions which will be taken up if sat
isfactory showing is made by our
men here. We have received offers,
I may add, from every university
in the Middle West to play us
either here or on gridirons farther
East.
Head-Coach Fickert said in re
gard to the football outlook: "The
material out this year is relatively
fair, but I am somewhat disap
pointed in the freshmen. We
have at least a dozen suits left that
ought to have good men inside
them. I like to see all the men
out early in the season, as there is
less show of their getting hurt. I
want to get acquainted with all the
men just as soon as 1 can. At the
end of next week we will take up
heavy work. This is early, I know,
but it is necessary, as the season is
short. The first game of the series
will occur the 21st, when the
Freshmen will play the Lowell
High. I am rather afraid we will
be beaten, too, for they have a good
team. I expect to institute signal
practice tomorrow. Be sure to say
that we need more freshmen, and
we need them badly."
" Dad" Moulton had little to say

about the rules except that the
regulation concerning delay was a
good one. " I don't like," he said,
"to see a team lie down and spar
for wind, by the misuse of the old
rule. I shall try to so train this
team that we will not have to do
this. There are two things we
shall attempt to do: one to teach
the team how to play ball, the
other to get it into proper physical
condition."
Comparatively few men were out
tonight to practice.
