# Decennial Anniversary.
## 
### 
On October Ist we shall have
reached the tenth anniversary of the
day on which the University was
thrown open to students. The occa
sion will be commemorated with ap
propriate services in the evening in
Assembly Hall. It is desired, among
other things, to render the same
choruses that were given ten years
ago. Mr. J.J. Morris, of Palo Alto,
has kindly volunteered to train the
chorus; and all who sing are re
quested to attend the meetings
which he will announce, for prac
tice, and make the chorus as large
and effective as possible. The first
meeting is called for Wednesday,
Sept. 18th, at 8 p.m., in the chapel.
I). S. Jordan.
