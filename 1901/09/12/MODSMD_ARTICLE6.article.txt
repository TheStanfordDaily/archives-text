# AT EASTERN UNIVERSITIES
## Account of Secretary Harter's Visit in the Interests of the Y. M. C. A. 
### 
Mr. Lloyd E. Harter, General
Secretary of the Y. M. C. A., made
an extensive tour during vacation,
of some six or seven Eastern uni
versities. Mr. Harter left Stanford
some two weeks before the end of
last semester, and in company with
Mr. Cuttle, General Secretary at
Berkeley, went directly to North
western University, arriving there
just in time for the annual Asso
ciation banquet. Mr. Harter says
this banquet was indeed a gorgeous
affair. The large hall used for the
purpose was filled with nearly two
thirds of all the men in college.
After speeches and between toasts
the air vibrated to the merry
sounds of college songs and } T ells,
thrilling the visitors with their en
thusiastic spirit. Finally the cli
max of the evening came when at
a preconcerted signal all the men
sprang to their feet, singing the
college song, "Long Live North
western." This concluded the pro
gram.
The campus at Wisconsin is in
the highest measure beautiful.
The grounds lie on a hillside which
slopes down between two lakes,
causing the building to lie in a
beautiful terrace, studded here and
there with trees to add beauty to
the scene. Wisconsin supports a
flourishing branch of the Y. M.
C. A., and in addition their secre
tary has just about completed ar
rangements for a $100,000 building
to be used by the Association.

Mr. Harter next visited the Uni
versity of Illinois at Champaign,
where he was entertained at one of
the best appointed Association
houses in the West. Illinois has a
unique idea of its own in "hous
ing" the Association, which adds
greatly to the social as well as to
the religious part of its Jife. From
here he went to the University of
Chicago. The most impressive
feature about Chicago is the simi
larity of its buildings to those of
Stanford. The great intercollegiate
meet June Ist on Marshall Field
was a feature of interest during the
visit there. Instead of a dual meet
between two colleges, ten different
institutions of the Middle West
sent out teams to participate in the
event, making in all 163 contest
ants. Seven preliminary heats
were required in the 220 yard dash,
while the other events were equally
as crowded. However, the most
exciting event of the day was the
one-mile relay race, which kept the
grandstand in a turmoil for several
seconds.
After completing his tour of the
Middle West, Mr. Harter proceeded
to New York City. He was at first
rather disappointed with the ap
pearance of Columbia, because its
buildings are so scattered, with
dwellings and business houses be
tween. The library, gymnasium
and dormitory buildings are the
most impressive in point of archi
tecture, and near the library build
ing the Y. M. C. A. is erecting an
enormous structure.
After spending some days in New
York, Mr. Harter went down to
New Haven for a taste of the at
mosphere about one of the " Big
Four." The buildings at Yale have
an extremely quaint and pictur
esque appearance. Their architec
ture is of the old square type, to
which the green shutters and old
vines give a wonderful beauty.
Enormous elms are everywhere
about the grounds.
At Harvard there were several
old Stanford men. It is interesting
to observe the eating accommoda
tions for students at Harvard. Two
co-operative dining hallsof national
renown accommodate a large num
ber of students, while Memorial
Hall, accommodating about 1,200,
and Fox Hall, holding 700, supply
the rest at the rates of $18 and $15
per month, respectively.
Mr. Harter attended the Jubilee
convention at Boston, which cele
brated fifty years of Y. M. C. A.
work. This was not marked by the
attendance of large crowds, but
among those present were nine uni
versity presidents and eleven rail
road managers.
Mr. Harter attended the Y. M.
C. A. summer school at Geneva, on
his return West.
