The vesper service held in the
chapel this afternoon opened with
singing by a choir of selected
voices, assisted by the orchestra.
One of Whittier's poems was read
by Professor Murray. This was
followed by a violin solo, rendered
by Mr. Scoville.
Professor Murray made a brief
address on the value of the vesper
service and on our bearing it in
mind.
