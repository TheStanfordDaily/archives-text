All men and women students
who wish to gain experience in
newspaper work, and desire in ad
dition a closer acquaintance with
every kind of college activity,
should come to the meeting which
will be held at the Daily Palo
Alto office Saturday at 4:30.
There is room for at least twenty
five workers on this paper. Among
such a number it will be possible
to divide the work so that each
member will have something to do
at a time when it will not interfere
with his regular University studies.
Each member will be made re
sponsible for the news of some one
department on certain days during
the week. His fidelity to this duty
will count much toward his posi
tion on the stuff. Both associate
and assistant editors will be given
some regular routine duty, and be
sides will be expected to get the
general news of the community on
those days which will be assigned
to them.
Each person expecting to work
on the paper is requested to look
over his schedule and determine
what two afternoons in the week
he can best give to the interests of
the paper.
In making up the staff organ
ization, former members will have
an advantage over new applicants
in that their previous services will
be considered. They are all sure of
a place on the staff, although posi
tions have not yet been assigned.
These men are Lockey, '01; Lewis,
Wilson, '04; Waite, '02; Kimball,
Crary, Stephenson, '03; and An
derson, '04.
The new men who have applied
for positions are Pleak, Hall, '02;
Miss Kip, Thomas, Powell, '03;
Rockey, Holman, '04; and Flem
ming, Crane, Dwight, Blaire, Jer
ould, Cole, '05.
These persons will be given posi
tions soon, according to the merits
of their work.
Besides those just mentioned, a
correspondent staff, composed of

all the University correspondents
on outside papers, will be directly
connected with the Daily Palo
Alto. These men will not be ex
pected to do so much writing for
the paper as the rustling of news.
