# PRESIDENT McKINLEY IS DEAD.

### 
At 2:55 o'clock this afternoon President McKinley died at the Milburn house, Buffalo, from
the wounds he received at the hands of an anarchist in that city one week ago today. Up to last
night the President had shown every indication that he would recover. During the early hours this
morning, however, he experienced a sinking spell. He seemed to improve later, and just after noon to
day appeared to have regained his strength of yesterday, but another relapse followed this rally. Just
before life became extinct the sufferer's respiration was 40, and his pulse beat had reached 125.
