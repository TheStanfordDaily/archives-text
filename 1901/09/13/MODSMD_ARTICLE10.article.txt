At the close of work this week
the coaches and trainers seem to
have the football squad very well
in hand. The number out for prac
tice, while never great, has shown
great interest in the work, and the
chances for three strong Stanford
teams seems, so far, to he very
good. By the end of next week all
light work will have passed and
the three teams will play the
game. Tonight the first line can he
had on the new men, as two Fresh
man scrub elevens were put through
signal practice, one by Lewers and
the other by Fickert. The men on
Fickert's section were: Eppley, r.
e.; Hunter, r. t.; Galbraith, r. g.;
Montzingo, c.; Witzemann, 1. g.;
Wilbur, 1. t.; Sefton, 1. e.; \V. R.
Taylor, g.; l\ Tarpey, 1. h.; Moore,
r. h.; Dinwoodie, 112. Lewer's men
were: Kehrlein, 1. e.; 1). Tarpey, 1.
t.; Austin, 1. g.; Burke, c.; Stillman,
r. g.; J. C. Taylor, r. t.; Boyles, r.
e.; Trowbridge, g.; Bush, 1. h.;
Kehrlein, r. h.; Dole, 112.
Work tonight was, on the whole,
a good deal harder than has been
done yet, and the coaches, Trainer
Moulton and Captain Fisher evi
dently intend to get the men into
shape as quickly as possible, the
I season being so short.
