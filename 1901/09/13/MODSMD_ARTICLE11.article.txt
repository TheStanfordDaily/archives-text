# GLEE CLUB TRY-OUT.
## Forty-five Men Compete.—Lack of First Tenor Voices. Rehearsal Monday. 
### 
The annual Glee Club try-out
was held lust night in the Ruble
parlors. Forty-five men tried for
the various positions. There was a
great lack of first tenor, only four
of the men having this desired
quality of voice. It is hoped that
if there be any one in college who
can sing first tenor he will come
for tr}'-out at the chapel next Mon
day, at 7:30 p.m., when the club
meets for its first practice. Several
men, who tried for first tenor, were
shifted to the second tenor list,
since quality and not quantity is
needed, particularly in such a
prominent part as first tenor.
There is a lack of good second bass
voices and a large field of first bass
and second tenor voices to draw
from. Seven on each part will be
kept until the middle of October,
when two from each part will »be
dropped. This will leave five on a
part at Christmas, when one more
will have to be dropped, leaving
four for each part to go on the
Christmas trip. Prompt attendance
and attention during rehearsals are
strong points in judging a candi
date. The following men will ap
pear for the first rehearsal on
Monday: First tenor, C. H. Baker,
'03, H. «. Gay, '03, B. E. Nourse,
