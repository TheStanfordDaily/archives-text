Today the people of the United
States are buried in sorrow and in
shame. They are in sorrow he
cause their foremost fellow-citizen,
upon whom they had placed the
highest honor and greatest responsi
bility at their command, whose
ability and statesmanship they ad
mired, whose pure and noble per
sonality they loved, now is dead.
They are in shame because, at a
time of peace and prosperity, with
out strife at home or abroad, their
chief executive, an innocent and
honored visitor at an exhibition of
the fruits of this peace and in
dustry, was kiiled by the bullet of
an assassin.
