Without attempting to overstep
its limits as purely a college news
paper, the Daily Palo Alto will
begin next Monday to publish a
concise statement of important out
side news items.
Isolated to some extent from the
world at large, and more or less
absorbed in the studies and affairs
peculiar to our own little commu
nity, we are prone not to keep up
on current information. The pur
pose of this column will not be to
give details, but to place before
readers of this paper each day a
digest of leading events.

All mkmbe rb of the Class of
1903 should attend the meeting at
1:10, next Monday. The Juniors
have an annual to publish this year,
and arrangements to make for a
plug dedication in the near future.
