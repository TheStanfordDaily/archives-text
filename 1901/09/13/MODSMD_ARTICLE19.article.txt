Engineers, and it covers ahout
forty pages, including diagrams
and maps. The data is confined

of the province of Chili and theeast
ern part of the province of Shansi,
hut the outline gives an idea of the
extension of these fields over the
entire region.
In closing Dr. Drake states that

servative estimate, would give
ahout 350,000,000,000 tons, or
enough to supply the world at its
