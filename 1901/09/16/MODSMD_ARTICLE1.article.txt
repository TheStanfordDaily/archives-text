### 
This afternoon the following ex
pression, prepared by a committee
consisting of E. W. Rice, Percy
McDowell and Ray 0. Hadley,
was adopted at the meeting of the
Associated Students:
VVe, the students of Leland Stan
ford Jr. University, in mass meet
ing assembled, wish to give you
public expression of our grief at the
death of our president, William
McKinley. Our sorrow is mingled
with feelings of revulsion at the
enormity of the crime by which a
noble man, a brave citizen, a great
statesman, an able executive, a
faithful and loving husband lost
bis life, a martyr to free govern
ment. He lies dead today because
his acceptance of the duties
which we, his fellow citizens, im
posed upon him, made him the tar
get for the bullet, directed by a
social outcast. Our consolation
must be drawn from the last words
of the noble soul before its dissolu
tion: "It's God's way. His will
be done."
We herewith instruct the chair
man of this body to send the fol
lowing message:
Mrs. William McKinley,
Care Secretary of State,
Washington, D. 0.
The students of Stanford Uni
versity extend tenderest sympathy.
We mourn for your husband, our
President.
