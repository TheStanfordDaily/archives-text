The action of the Associated
Students this afternoon was ex
tremely ill-advised. It is in direct
opposition to the ruling of the Fac
ulty Committee. Those at the bot
tom of the movement may have
supposed that the Committee
would modify their former decision.
Nothing is more absurd. Is this
University ruled by students?
The Daily Palo Alto believes
that the resolution adopted in so
far as it declared that Mr. Nourse
alone would be held responsible for
the duties of his office, was not
acted upon with due consideration.
An expression of confidence in Mr.
Nourse would have been appropri
ate; it is deserved. But when the
students openly defy the authority
of the University they can look for
but one outcome.
Unless the hurried action of this
afternoon is immediately modified,
we will be forced into the position
of having to abandon athletics for
the season.
So long as student offices are
conducted in conformity with cer
tain regulations made for the gov
ernment of university policy, no
interference of any kind occurs.
When, however, students undertake
to trespass these rules, they may
he brought to realize the extent of
faculty authority.
Whatever the merits of the ease
may be, the student body has
blundered.
