# Rooters' Meeting'.
## 
### 
The object of the rooters' meeting
to be held tomorrow afternoon is to
nominate a number of men who
shall have complete charge of the
yelling from now until just before
the intercollegiate freshman game.
At that time one of the nominees
will be chosen leader to serve dur
ing the remainder of the season.
This plan has been adopted in
order that everyone may have an
equal chance, and that the best
leader may be chosen to lead the
yelling at both intercollegiate
games. Every man who has the
qualifications of a yell leader
should be nominated for that posi
tion. We must have the best man
available.
