# Sierra Club Outing.
## 
### 
The Sierra Club, a .society for the
preservation of forest and to incite
general interest in California lands,
held its first outing last summer.
The club plans to hold annual out
ings each summer on account of
the success and pleasure of this
first attempt.
In the party there were many
Stanford and Berkeley people.
Among those from Stanford were
Professors Fairclough and Dudley;
Mil nor Roberts, '99; Miss Roberts,
Miss C. A. Goodhue, Miss Sarah
Martin, F. A. Corbusier, '02; A. B.
Watson, '04; and Ghirardelli, '03.
Among the Berkeley contingent
were Charles Elston, '98, captain of
the varsity baseball team of '98;
John Mdir, president of the club;
Dr. Merriam of the IJ. S. geological
survey; William Keith, the artist;
and Theodora Hittell, the historian.

The parties proceeded to Tuol
umne Meadows, and there made a
permanent camp. From there
small parties made expeditions to
[joints of interest. The majority of
the party climbed Mt. Hoffman,
Mt. Dana and Mt. Lyle. Professor
Fairclough and Mr. Ells of San
Francisco made a trip down the
Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne
and up Cathedral Canyon, a most
difficult route. John Muir told
them they were probably the first
persons to make the trip. Miss C.
A. Goodhue was nearly always the
first woman to reach the summits
of the mountains, and in all the
rough work of mountain climbing
stood at the head of the woman
climbers. In fact, the Stanford
party, as a whole, was always ready
for all the rough work at hand.
The evenings were spent around
the camp-fires with song, dance
and story telling. A quartette,
composed of Corbusier, Watson,
Elston and another Berkeley stu
dent, gave pleasure and fun to all
the party. Professor Dudley gave
especially interesting talks on the
flora of the region.
All pronounced themselves well
pleased with the trip and signify
their intention of making another
next year.
