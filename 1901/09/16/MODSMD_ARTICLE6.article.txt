# NOURSE IS ENDORSED.

### 
Resolutions of Confidence Adopted.
Students Hold Him Alone Re
sponsible.
E. S. Page, '00, introduced the
following resolution which was
adopted without opposition at the
meeting of the Associated Students
in the chapel this afternoon:
W hereas, The authority of the
Treasurer of the Associated Stu
dents has been questioned, and
Whereas, We deem a statement
of our position advisable, therefore,
be it
liesolved, That we, the Associ
ated Students of Stanford Univer
sity, do place implicit confidence
in Mr. Nourse, and hold him alone
responsible for all acts connected
with his office.
The resolution is in direct con
flict with the position of the faculty
that we shall not conduct athletics
under Mr. Nourse's management.
To the amendment, posted one
week ago today, giving the Exe
cutive Committee power to remove
any officer when deemed necessary,
Mr. Mice of the committee offered a
substitute giving the power to the
Associated Students instead. W.
I. Traeger raised the point that the
substitute could not be voted upon
until after it had been posted one
week. President McCormick ruled
that action might be taken at the
meeting, since the notice of the
original proposed amendment had
been posted. Traeger appealed
from the decision, and McCormick
was over-ruled. Nothing further
was done.
Attitude of Faculty Committee.
Members of the faculty com
mittee on student affairs were
asked this afternoon for an ex
pression upon the action of the
students. Professor Green, chair
man of the committee, said that he
was confident the committee would
not recede from its position. i)r.
Gilbert would say nothing about
the subject, except that, if Nourse
continues in office, the committee
may take up the matter. Professor
Richardson expressed the opinion
that the faculty will not change its
attitude. Dr. Branner and l)r.
Jenkins seemed to hold the same
opinion.
The-controversy has resolved it
self into a proposition which must
result in either the students or the
faculty giving in, or the abandon
ment of athletics.
