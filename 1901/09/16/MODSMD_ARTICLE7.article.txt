# Saturday's Practice.
## 
### 
In Saturday afternoon's practices
the fresh men showed up with a
fair number out for work. Under
Captain Fisher and Coach Lowers
they were put through some sharp
drill in signalling, bucking, and
holding the line, practice plays,
and falling on the ball. Fisher
worked the backs and Lewers the
line men. There was a good deal
of competition and most of the in
fants were sweating heavily at the
end of the hour. "Young" Dole
at full, Hunter and Sefton at
tackle, Boyles at center, Paul Tar
pey at half, Nissen center, and
•Smith guard, did work that stood
out well from a fairly high aver
age on the part of nearly every
man playing. Dole's work at full

was the surprise of the day. He
played quick, snappy ball, bit the
line hard, and was generally good
for u gain. There is every indica
tion that he will he quite up to the
standard of his illustrious family.
Both the Kehrleins who were used
mostly on the line, and little Tay
lor at quarter are putting up a
good game. It is understood that
Horan of Lafayette, will be out in
canvas as soon as the arrival of his
credentials from the East will al
low him to register, lie is re
garded as sure of a place on the
'05 and second eleven teams, and as
having a good show for a job 011
the Varsity.
Tonight's Work.
At the practice tonight forty-six
men wore canvas suits. The two
fresbman scrub teams were given
rather sharp practice in their first
line up against each other. Van
Cycle, at right end, did good work.
Tom McFadden and "Billy" Erb,
of the old varsity team, helped
Coach Fickert and Cantain Fisher.
