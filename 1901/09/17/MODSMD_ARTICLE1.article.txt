# NOURSE CONTROVERSY.
## Standpoint of the Faculty Committee.—Attitude of President Jordan. 
### 
In view of the precipitate action
taken by the Associated Students
yesterday the Daily Palo Alto
deems it necessary to lay open all
the facts, so far as they can be as
certained, bearing upon the contro
versy between Treasurer John T.
Nourse and the Faculty Commit
tee. It must be recalled that Mr.
Nourse was elected to fill an unex
pired term as treasurer, made va
cant by the suspension of Henry
Taylor, elected for the year, who,
though in every way an admirable
officer, had neglected his five hours
university work while attending to
the duties of his position, and was
not allowed to continue.
From the Faculty Standpoint.
After the suspension of Treasurer
Taylor at Christmas, the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents endeavored to have the rule
abolished by which that officer is
compelled to carry five hours of
university work. President Mar
rack of the association and Mr.
Nourse, prior to his election, had
one interview each with Professor
Gilbert, chairman of the Commit
tee on Scholarship, and one at
which both were present. They
were given to understand that the
rule would not be waived; that, if
under any circumstances this could
be done, it would have been done
for Mr. Taylor whose conduct of
student affairs was in every way
satisfactory to the faculty. Early
in January Mr. Nourse interviewed
PVofessor Green, chairman of the
Committee on Student Affairs, to
ascertain whether or not, in case
the constitution of the Associated
Students was amended, the five
hour requirement would be re
moved. Professor Green informed
him that under no circumstances
would the modification (be allowed
to apply to the current semester,
and that the committee would con
sider the matter thoroughly before
allowing such a provision to become
effective at all.
Mr. Nourse had been elected.
He assumed the office and, instead
of limiting his work to the bare five
hours, he registered for Law 9, two
hours, Law 11, three hours, and
Law 18 three hours, making a total
of eight hours.
On March 26th, Mr. Nourse filed
this petition addressed to the Fac
ulty:
"I, John Thomas Nourse, Jr.,
major subject Law, respectfully ask
permission to drop the following
courses: Law (Bills and Notes)
11, three hours; Law (Sales) 9, two
hours.
"If this petition is granted 1
shall then be registered for three
hours. The reason for this request
is that my work as student body
treasurer is such that 1 am unable
to carry these courses properly
during the remainder of the semes
ter. This work will be greater,
making it necessary for me to be
in San Francisco a great part of the
time, and thus absent from classes."
The petition bears the endorse
ment of approval by J. E. Rey
nolds and James P. Hall, of the

Law department. It was referred
to the Committee on Scholarship,
and the record of its action is stated
on the back as follows: "May not
reduce registration below five
hours." (Signed) C. H. G. (C. H.
Gilbert).
Following the action of this com
mittee, the document bears state
ment of the final action taken by
the Committee on Registration:
"Not granted. L. R. L." (L. R.
Lenox). "4-12-'01." (April 12,
1901. Notice of the fact that the
petition had not been granted was
posted April 18th, as evidenced by
the stamp of the Registrar's office.
Although the petition was re
fused, Nourse failed to continue his
class work. This, however, was
not brought to the knowledge of
the Committee on Student Affairs
before the student body election of
treasurer for this year. Although
other names were presented for ap
proval, Nourse's was not, hence the
Committee did not investigate the
matter, and did not act upon the
eligibility of his name for the posi
tion. Such being the case, it was
implied by the students that he
was acceptable.
Before the end of the semester,
the Committee on Scholarship,
learning the condition of his work
which had been dropped without
permission, investigated his class
record for the year. For the first
semester, before Mr. Nourse became
treasurer, the report in the Regis
trar's office, with comments from
the instructors of the various
courses, appeared as follows: "Law
(Equity) 6, two hours, conditioned
(very poor); Law (Sales) 9, two
hours, conditioned (poor); Law
(Bills and Notes) 11, three hours,
deferred (poor); Law (Persons) 13,
two hours, deferred (poor); Law
(Corporations) 18, three hours, de
ferred (too much outside work);
Law (Cal. Practice) 22, one hour,
deferred."
For the second semester, while
Mr. Nourse was conducting the
duties of treasurer, the report ap
pears as follows: "Law 9, two
hours, failed (very poor); Law 11,
three hours, conditioned (poor);
Law 18, three hours, conditioned
(very inexact, careless.)"
Upon the basis of this showing
the Committee on Scholarship de
clared Mr. Nourse suspended for
neglect of his University work. It
was then that the Committee on
Student Affairs became officially
cognizant of the situation and was
compelled to declare for the en
forcement of the rule always exer
cised against suspended students,
namely that no one under suspen
sion may participate in student
affairs. The history of what has
been done this semester is known
to everybody. Mr. Nourse never
requested until last Monday that
the Committee on Scholarship
should reconsider his petition.
