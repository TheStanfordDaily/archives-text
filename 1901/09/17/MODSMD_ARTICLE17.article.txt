W. VV. Burnett, '01, last year's
varsity football captain, is visiting
friends here after a summer in the
Yosemite. He leaves tomorrow
for San Luis Obispo, intending to
return to the campus in a week,
when he will assist in the coaching
of the big team. In an interview
this afternoon "Babe" said: "Of
course I can't tell much about the
fellows' work, but it seems that we
have a good show for football suc
cess this year. The big team will
be practically the same as last sea
son, for while we have lost a few
good men, there are others to take
their places. Charley Fickert is
one of the finest coaches in the
country, and with the material I
have already seen for freshman
and second eleven teams, I con
sider our show for victory good.
The freshmen are the huskiest lot
of scrubs I've seen for a long time.
Berkeley,.on the other hand, has
lost her best men and is up against
it."
