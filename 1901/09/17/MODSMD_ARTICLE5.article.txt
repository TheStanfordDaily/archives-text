# REV. ASA D. FISKE.
## A 						Large Audience Assembled for the Sunday Morning Service. 
### 
Rev. Asa J). Fiske of Washing
ton, U. C., delivered the Sunday
morning sermon in the chapel.
The readings were from tiie third
and sixth chapters of St. Paul's
Epistle to the lfiphesians. The text
chosen was: " Unto whom much
is given, of him shall much he re
quired."
In speaking of the text Dr.
Fiske remarked, "That is common
sense. It is to us the nineteenth
century was left."
In the war between the United
States andSpain, in defense of Cuba,
the part taken by the United States
was spoken of as "the absolutely
unique war of all the ages, which
sought to crush the barbarism of
Spain; a war unique for its vast
undertaking. Lasting about one
hundred days, it will he famous for
making more for history than a
thousand common years, if only
the world uses well its mighty
choice."
The achievements made by men
of all nations were referred to; the
aggressiveness of the century; the
peace policy proposed by the Czar of
Russia, heretofore one of the most
warlike nations; the ascent of the
Nile by the British to overthrow
the slave trade; the enterprise of
the Americans " who have pushed
out to the Pacific, even up to the
Behring Sea"; the enterprise of sci
ence in the telephone, telegraph,
and now wireless telegraphy. La
bor-saving machinery was spoken
of: for example, an envelope-mak
ing machine which cuts the paper,
folds it, gums the required edges,
counts the envelopes, putting a
certain number in each box and
sending the box down a chute five
stories below, ready for shipment,
the one machine tended by a little
girl, whose only duty is to notify
the inspector if the machinery be
comes disordered.
The work of the medical world
is considered a vast science, but
great as it is could not save the
life of our president, in the opening
year of the twentieth century.
Dr. Fiske said, " Greater than
all was the first century, in
which Christ was born." The birth
of Christ was the great epoch in
which Christ's teachings were
transmitted to all the ages.
Dr. Fiske said all the advance
ment made by art, science, litera
ture, and all the learning and sci
ence of other ages, were bequeathed
to us by the nineteenth century, as
a holy trust to carry forward.
"Be worthy men and women of
your time. All is given to you in
solemn trust from God and all the
ages, and you in turn are to pass it
along. You are the fate of the
future. God will ask you wha.t
you have done with his world.
You dare not and you will not
scorn your religion. O, be wor
thy!"
