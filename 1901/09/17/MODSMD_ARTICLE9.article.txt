While at the National Guard
Encampment at Santa Cruz this
summer, 11. 1). Walter, '00, ser
geant-major on the Governor's
staff gave a banquet to the Stan
ford men in the division. There
were present: C. R. Detrick, in
structor in Economics, of the San

the signal corps, Justice Stewart,

sergeant in the 2d California.
Walter royally entertained his
guests and the time was most pleas
antly passed with stories and
toasts.
As it happened, the Sanitary
Corps was having a banquet at
the same time and as the Stanford
party broke they gave three cheers
for Adjutant General Seamans and
Surgeon General Anderson and
then the Stanford yell. As they
were leaving, General Seamans
called them back and champagne
and cigars were furnished and
Herbert Walter was called on for a
toast. He responded to the "Non
commissioned oflicerof the Guard."
With one more Stanford yell the
party adjourned to the porch and
spent the rest of the evening in
singing college songs.
