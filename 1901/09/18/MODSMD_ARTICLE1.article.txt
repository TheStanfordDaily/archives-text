# GRIDIRON WORK.
## Practices Show Snap and Vigor and An Improved Physical Condition of the Men. 
### 
Practice work for the four Stan
ford football teams grows harder
every evening. Last night com
plete line-ups of every aggregation
were formed, the Varsity being
composed of Luck, 1. e.; Traeger, 1.
t.; Thompson, 1. g.; McFadden, c.;
Barnhisel, r. g.; Hauverman, r. t.;
Cooper, r. e.; Kaitt, q. b.; Smith,
1. h.; Hill, r. h.; Slaker, 112. With a
a few changes it is highly probable
that the line-up given here will be
that for the big game. The Var
sity went through its work in .sig
nals and practice plays with a
snap and vigor that speaks well
for their physical condition. The
second team, which will buck the
Varsity in practice, is composed of
a number of good men, and it is
likely to come very near the high
standard set by last year's wearers
of the side "S." The following
men held positions on it at last
night's practice: " Baldy " Nourse,
1. e.; Lockwood, 1. t.; Talbot, 1. g.;
Hayden, o.; " Doe" Moore, r. g.;
"Guiby" Dole, r. t.; Patterson, r.
e.; Crawford, q. b.; Allen, 1. h.;
Parker, r. h.; Boren, 112. b.
With only a few exceptions,
the Freshman scrub teams were
the same as before. It is as
serted, by the way, by several
of those who know, that the work
done by the Freshmen is entirely
up to the standard of many Var
sity teams, prominent in excellence
being that of Dole, Van Cycle,
Boyles, Wilbur, Hunter, Sefton,
"Spike" Taylor, Bartell, the two
Tarpeys, and Smith. The work
given these two teams now consists
in playing the game just as much
as possible, doing much in bucking
the line and running the ends.
Both teams are as yet weak in
punting and passing, a number of
nasty fumbles being made in re
cent practices. Fickert, Lewers,
Fisher, and recently, Tom Mc-
Fadden and Billy Erb, deserve the
greatest credit for the masterly way
they are handling the scrubs.
The entire squad is already
showing marked improvement in
endurance and wind, and Trainer
Moulton thinks he will have no
difficulty in having every man in
prime condition by the first part of
next month.
This afternoon the two Fresh
man teams will play against each
other as before, and the Varsity
and second eleven will go through
light work; there will be no prac
tice tomorrow. Next week the
Varsity and second eleven will be
gin trying conclusions with each
other on the gridiron, and it is in
tended to start the training-tables
as soon after that as possible.
These will be run in Palo Alto,
and tho men will go to and fro in
a bus. It is intended to give the
second eleven nuyi much better
treatment this season than last,
and every man who can play foot
ball is urged to be out, for on one
or two nights last week there were
not enough men for two line-ups,
forty-four men being necessary.
Spalding and McMillan will be
here a little earlier than was ex

pected, about the first of next
month, it is said. Austin will take
the place of "Billy" McLeod as
rubber.
Nothing definite could be ascer
tained this afternoon regarding the
Freshman game Saturday. Lowell
High School will be unable to con
form to the schedule. Unless ar
rangements can be made with the
Palo Alto liigh or Hoitt's Prepara
tory School, there will be no game.
