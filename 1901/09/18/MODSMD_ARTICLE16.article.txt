The list of associate editors at
the head of this column is made up
of names of men whose work on the
paper is known. They have been
given positions largely on the
merits of this work. It is expected
that they will do as good work as
formerly.
The new men will be given posi
tions next week. On the general
standard of their work, as far ;is
can be determined, depends the
preliminary organization of the
staff.
The staff of outside correspond
ents is given today for the lirst
time also. Three of these men
hold positions on the editorial
staff. The others will be directly
connected with the editorial policy.
