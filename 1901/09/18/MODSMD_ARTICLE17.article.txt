Without presuming to a com
plete knowledge of football, certain
of us are curious to know why the
freshman squad persist in batter
ing a player when he is obviously
" down. 0 It is a practice that
seems to the observer peculiarly
idiotic at all times and often pro
ductive of much harm. At last
night's practice, for instance, a can
didate who is needed in the line-up
became the base of a jostling pyra
mid of arms and legs, when any one
with half an eye could see that the
play had ended. As a result, he is
limping about today with a
wrenched knee and a prospect of
being barred from practice indefi
nitely. It is zeal we want to see in
the players, but not such misun
derstood zeal as this.
