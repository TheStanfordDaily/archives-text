# This Week's "Sequoia."

In this issue of the Sequoia
Editor Bunnell says that lie is
after stories of Western color
especially. Therein he is wise.
What better mouthpiece can West
ern life have, what belter book
than the magazine of a Western
college to record the romances of
the Spanish settler, the vacquero,
the treasure seeker, the Indian,
and, in the present day, the soldier
in Hawaii, or the Philippines, and
who better to write such tales than
the Western student.
The number of the Sequoia at
hand contains one such story, well
told, by F. H. Fowler, and some
thing that hits along the same line
in the Japanese sketch by Presi
dent Jordan. Ike Russell has some
swinging verse about the Philip
pine soldier.
The Sequoia has made steady
advances, and bids fair, under the
present control, to take a stand
among the best periodicals of the
kind published. None can be more
pleased thereby than a sister paper
in the same college. The Sequoia
looks, acts, and speaks like a self
respecting magazine.
