Mr. 11. Morse Stephens, the pro
fessor of European history at Cor
nell, lectured to the students
Monday afternoon in* the chapel,
the subject chosen being "Amer
ica's Religion: the School." Pro
fessor Stephens said: "I realize
that I know very little about
America's civilized life.
"1 have found in different parts
of the country that in the small
town the best building is the high
school. The first thing that strikes
one in Europe is the church. The
English cities are built round their
churches. The church dominates
the lives of European people. It is
therefore the mark of European
civilization."
To show that the school is the
main factor in American civiliza
tion, Dr. Stephens cited Duluth
as an instance. The first thing seen
was the roof of the high school tow
ering above everything else. He
stated that in Skaguay, Alaska,
the school house was the on W brick
building in the town, the rest of the
houses being merely temporary
frame residences.
Dr. Stephens said: "The school
teacher follows the soldier. In the
Philippines, as soon as the fighting
is over, the soldier turns to teaching
school. Education has taken the

place of religion in the work of
civilization. The State recognizes
no religious creed, but it does
recognize education.
"In Europe the impression made
on the minds of the people is the
history of the past. Whatever a
man does there, he looks back upon
the past. Professor Eliot of Har
vard called a-building of one hun
dred and fifty years' duration, old.
It is difficult to express this refer
ence as old, in comparison to the
buildings of Europe: 'The reason
why the American people try so
many things is because they have
no past —nothing to look back to.'
"The Americans have conquered
space in the telephone, telegraph
and railroad. The spirit of rever
ence in England subsists largely in
the study of the past. The past is
indeed mother of the present.
"Keep the quality of reverence
for the past by looking upon his
tory. The plea for the fact that
reverence is due to the past, is that
it can come only through the teach
ings of the history of the past.
Therefore, reverence the past."
