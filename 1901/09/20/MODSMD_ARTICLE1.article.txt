# IMPRESSIVE SERVICES.
## President Jordan Spoke Powerfully on the "Lessons of the Tragedy." 
### 
On the fourteenth of last May
the Stanford Assembly Hall, gaily
decorated with flags, bunting and
flowers, symbols of welcome, was
tilled with a crowd awaiting the
arrival of the President of the
United States. William McKinley
did not come that afternoon be
cause of devotion to his afflicted
wife, who was near death. Yester
day the same big auditorium, with
its gay decorations replaced by the
black emblems of grief, was again
tilled with people. Instead of the
frivolous music of the former occa
sion, a funeral march resounded
through the hall; instead of shouts
of expectancy, the congregation
arose and sung the hymn which
had passed through the mind of
the dying martyr in his last con
scious moments, "Nearer My God
to Thee."
The invocation and service were
by Rev. D. Charles Gardner, of the
Palo Alto Episcopal church, pre
ceding a beautiful solo rendering of
Tennyson's "Crossing the liar" by
Dr. Geo. li. Little, also of Palo
Alto. The services were all very
impressive.
Dr. Jordan gave the leading ad
dress, his theme being " Lessons of
the Tragedy." He spoke as fol
lows:
We meet today under the sway
of a number of different emotions.
We would express our sorrow at
the untimely death of a good man.
We would show our regret that our
nation has lost the Chief Magis
trate of its choice. We would ex
press our sympathy with the gentle
woman who has been suddenly
bereft of the kindest and most con
siderate of husbands. We are filled
with shame that in our Republic,
the land where all men are free
and equal wherever they behave
themselves as men, the land which
has no rulers save the public ser
vants of its own choosing, a deed
like this should be possible. We
would express our detestation of
that kind of political and social
agitation which finds no method of
working reform save through in
timidation and killing. We would
wish to find the true lessons of this
event and would not let even the
least of them fall on our ears un
heeded.
And one plain lesson is this:
Under Democracy all violence is
treason. Whosoever throws a stone
at a scab teamster, whosoever fires
a shot at the President of the
United States, is an enemy of the
Republic. He is guilty of high
treason in his heart, and treason in
thought works itself out in lawless
ness of action.
The central fact of all democ
racy is agreement with law. It is
our law ; we have made it. If it is
wrong we can change it, but the
compact of democracy is that we
change it in peace. 'The sole
source of power under God is the
consent of the governed.' This
Cromwell once wrote across the
statute books of parliament. I his,
in other words, our fathers wrote in

our own Constitution. The will of
the people is the sole source of any
statute you or 1 may be called on
to obey. It is the ileeree of no
army, the dictum of no President.
It is the work of no aristocracy;
not of blood or of wealth. It is
simply our own understanding that
we have to do right, shall behave
justly, shall live and let our neigh
bor live. If our law is tyrannous, it
is our ignorance which has made it
so. Let it pinch a little and we
shall find out what hurts us. Then
it will he time to change. Laws are
made through the ballot, and
through the ballot we can unmake
them. There is no other honest
way, no other way that is safe, and
no other way which is effective. To
break the peace is to invite
tyranny. Lawlessness is the ex
pression of weakness, of ignorance,
of unpatriotism. If tyranny pro
voke anarchy, so does anarchy
necessitate tyranny. Confusion
brings the man on horseback. It
was to keep away both anarchy
and tyranny that the public school
was established in America.
Three times has our nation
been called upon to pass into the
shadow of humiliation, and each
time in the past its severe lesson it
has learned. When Lincoln fell,
slavery perished. To the American
of today human slavery in a land
of civilization is almost an im
possible conception, yet many of
us who think ourselves still young
can remember when half of this
land held other men in bondage
and the dearest hope of freedom
was that such things should not go
on forever. I can remember when
we looked forward to the time
when ' at least the present form of
slavery should be no more.' For
democracy and slavery could not
subsist together. The Union could
not stand —half slave, half free.
The last words of Garfield were
these: Strangulatus pro Jiepublica
(Slain for the Republic). The
feudal tyranny of the spoils system
which had made republican admin
istration a farce, has not had, since
Garfield's time, a public defender.
It has not vanished from our poli
tics, but its place is where it
belongs —among the petty wrongs
of maladministration.
Again a President is slain for
the Republic, and the lesson is the
homely one of peace and order,
patience and justice, respect for
ourselves through respect for the
law, for public welfare, and for
public right.
For this country is passing
through a time of storm and stress,
a flurry of lawless sensationalism.
The irresponsible journalism, the
industrial wars, the display of
hastily gotten wealth, the grasping
of monopoly, the walking delegate,
the vulgar cartoon, the foul
mouthed agitator, the sympathetic
strike, the unsympathetic lock-out,
are all symptoms of a single dis
ease —the loss of patriotism, the de
cay of the sense of justice. As in
other cases, the symptoms feed the
disease, as well as indicate it. The
deed of violence breeds more deeds
of violence: anarchy provokes
hysteria, and hysteria makes an
archy. The unfounded scandal
sets a hundred tongues to wagging,

and the seepage from the gutter
readies a thousand homes.
The journal for the weak-minded
and debased makes heroes of those
of its class who carry folly over
into crime. The half-crazy egotist
imagines himself a regicide and
his neighbor with the clean shirt is
his oppressor and therefore his
natural victim. Usually his heart
fails him, and his madness spends
itself in foul words. Sometimes it
does not, and the world stands
aghast. But it is not alone against
the Chief Magistrate that these
thoughts and deeds are directed.
There are usually others within
closer range. There is scarcely a
man in our country, prominent in
any way, statesman, banker, mer
chant, railway manager, clergy
man, teacher even, that has not,
somewhere, his would-be Nemesis,
some lunatic with a sensational
newspaper and a pistol prepared to
take his life.
The gospel of discontent has no
place within our Republic. It is
true, as has often been said, that
discontent is the cause of human
progress. It is truer still, as Mr.
John P. Irish has lately pointed
out, that discontent may be good
or bad, according to its relation to
the individual man. There is a
noble discontent which a man
turns against himself. It leads the
man who fails to examine his own
vveaknesses, to make the needed re
pairs in himself, then to take up
the struggle again. There is a
cowardly discontent, which leads
the man to blame all failure on
his prosperous neighbor or on so
ciety at large, as if a social system
existed apart from the men who
make it. This is the sort of dis
content to which the agitator ap
peals, that finds its stimulus in
sensational journalism. It is that
which feeds the frenzy of the
assassin who would work revenge
on society by destroying its ac
cepted head.
It is not theoretical anarchism or
socialism or any other "ism"
which is responsible for this.
Many of the gentlest spirits in the
world today call themselves an
archists, because they look forward
to the time when personal meek
ness shall take the place of all
statutes. The gentle anarchism of
the optimistic philosopher is not
that which confronts us today. It
is the anarchy of the
hatred of class for class ; a hatred
that rests only on distorted imag
ination, for, after all is said, there
are no classes in America. It
is the hatred imported from the
Old World, excited by walking
delegates whose purpose it is to
carry a torch through society,
fanned by agitators of whatever
sort, unpractical dreamers or con
scienceless scoundrels, exploited in
the newspapers, abetted by so
called high society with its dis
play of shoddy and greed, and
intensified by the cold, hard self
ishness which underlies the power
of the trust. All these people,
monopolists, social leaders, walk
ing delegates, agitators, sensa
tionalists, dreamers, are alien to
our ways, outside the scope of our
democracy, and enemies to good
citizenship.

The real Americans, trying to
live their lives in their own way,
saving a little of their earnings
and turning the rest into educa
tion and enjoyment, have many
grievances in these days of grasp
ing trusts and lawless unions. But
of such free Americans our country
is made. They are the people, not
the trusts or the unions, nor their
sensational go-betweens. This is
their government, and the govern
ment of the people, by the people,
and for the people shall not perish
from the earth. This is the people's
President —our President —who was
killed, and it is ours to avenge him.
Not by lynch law on a large or
small scale ma}' we do it; not by
anarchy or despotism ; not by the
destruction of all who call them
selves anarchists, not by abridging
freedom of the press-nor by check
ing freedom of speech. Those who
would wreak lawless vengeance on
the anarchists are themselves an
archists and makers of anarchists.
We have laws enough already
without making more for men to
break. Let us get a little closer to
the higher law. Let us respect our
own rights and those of our neigh
bor a little better. Let us cease to
tolerate sensational falsehood about
our neighbors, or vulgar abuse of
those in power. If we have bad
rulers, let us change them peace
fully. Let us put an end to every
form of intimidation, wherever
practiced. The cause that depends
upon hurling rocks or epithets, on
clubbing teamsters or derailing
trains, cannot be a good cause.
Even if originally in the right, the
act of violence puts the partisans
of such a cause in the wrong. No
freeman ever needs to do such
things as these. For the final
meaning of democracy is peace 011
earth,* good will towards men.
When we stand for justice among
ourselves we can demand justice of
the monopolistic trust. When we
attack it with clear vision and cool
speech we shall find the problem of
combination for monopoly not
greater than any other. And large
or small, there is but one way for
us to meet any problem : to choose
wise men, clean men, cool men, the
best we can secure through our
method of the ballot, and then
to trust the rest in their hands.
The murder of the President has 110
direct connection with industrial
war. Yet there is this connection,
that ail war, industrial or other,
loosens the bonds of order, destroys
mutual respcct and trust, gives in
spiration to anarchy, pushes a foul
thought on to a foul word, a foul
word 011 to a foul deed.
We trust that now that the
worst has come, the foulest deed
has been committed, that our civil
wars may stop, not through the
victory of one side over the other,
the trusts or the unions now set off
against each other, but in the vic
tory over both of the American
people, of the great body of men
and women who must pay for all,
and who are the real sufferers in
every phase of the struggle.

Slain for the Republic. The lesson

our daily lives. It is the lesson of
