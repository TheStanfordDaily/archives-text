Will the band organize before
the big football games? The weeks
in which to practice are growing
few. Lt is true that musicians
make sacrifices and devote time to
rehearsals, but this is no more than
the football player, the debater, the
manager of any student enterprise,
the college journalist, contributes
to the University community.
Those who play in the band receive
transportation to the city, admis
sion to the game, and expenses for
the trip. They receive other favors
which, in a measure, compensate
them for tlieir efforts.
Our rival across the bay always
sends a musical aggregation to the
big contest. Stanford lias taken
pride in the bands which repre
sented her. These not only add to
the spectacular effect of the Uni
versity sections, but tliey iifspire
enthusiasm before the teams ap
pear. Let every student who can
play an instrument attend the
meeting called for next Tuesday
evening.
