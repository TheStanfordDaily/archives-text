Considkring their short term of
preparation the eleven of the
Freshman class acquitted them
selves well in Saturday's game.
The strength that lies in concerted
action they have yet little concep
tion of, but each individual went
at his work with a vim that was
refreshing to observe. Nothing
breeds confidence like success at
the outset, and the '05 men should
now be in shape to benefit by the
instructions of coach and trainer.
It is early for predictions, and the
team that starts in with a rush
often drags at the finish, but at
present the outlook for a prosper
ous Freshman season is very en
couraging.
