# Encina Club Meeting.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Encina Club
last Friday evening to discuss the
dance, a resolution was introduced
to exclude the Examiner from the
list of the club papers, and to sub
stitute an evening paper instead.
There was considerable discussion
over the matter and some opposi
tion, on the ground that the Exam
iner was the only paper which
favored Stanford during the Ross
affair. A motion to adjourn was
presented, on which the vote was
about equally divided, but the
president declared the meeting ad
journed and the resolution was
lost,.
