# FRESHMEN WON.
## Defeat Belmont 22 to 6 in First Game of the Season.—Work Was Ragged. 
### 
Saturday afternoon at Belmont
the Stanford Freshmen defeated
Belmont Preparatory School 22 to 6
in their first game. The work on
both sides was a trifle ragged, al
though Belmont's team work
showed up better than her visitors'.
Individual work on Stanford's side
was good, and both eoacli and cap
tain feel pleased with the showing
made by the infants.
Stanford began playing sharp,
quick ball, following Paul Tarp
ley's kick-off with a touchdown in
the first six minutes of the play,
but missing the goal. In a little
over nine minutes the youngsters
had again worked the Belmont
line, Tarpley succeeding this time
in kicking the goal. Score, 11 to 0.
The game had by the last part of
the first half changed into a pro
cession down the field, and Full
back Sole of Stanford hurried mat
ters by breaking through the op
posing line, hypnotizing the Bel
mont quarter into passing him the
ball, and making a splendid run of
over half the length of the field to
the third touchdown. The goal
was again kicked.
Stanford's signals were changed
in the second half and several new
men put into places on the line;
while Belmont put up a desperate
tight and succeeded in making her
first touchdown, from which Bos
byshell kicked the goal. Score, 17 to
l>. The Cardinal team then braced
up and worked through to the home
team's goal line for a fourth touch
down before the half ended. Kick
for goal missed. Score, 22 to 6.

Bosbysliell, right half; Captain
Gillis, left half; Stowe, right tackle,
and Preston, left end, played good,
clean, hard ball f'»r Belmont; while
Fullback Dole, Joe Sefton on left
end, Paul Tarpley at left half, and
Van Cycle, left guard, did much
for Stanford. The work of the Car
dinal team showed, as was ex
pected, lack of practice and of or
ganization; each man played his
own game, and it is rather remark
able that such a score should be
run up against the preparatory
school boys, who have been in the
Held since August 14th. The team
will, of course, work well together
by the time a few more games have
been played. Its chief weaknesses

are in passing and goal-kicking;
and Coach Fickert and Captain
Fisher will shortly have theeeover
come by practice.
