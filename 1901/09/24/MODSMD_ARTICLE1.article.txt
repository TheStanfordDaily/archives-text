# NO TREASURER ELECTED.
## Faculty Says University President Must Have Power of Removal. 
### 
The Executive Committee met
last evening with all members pres
ent. The purpose of the gathering
was to elect a successor to Gradu
ate-Manager Nourse, resigned, but
complications were revealed which
will prevent the student body from
choosing such an officer until at
least a week has passed. Professor
Green, in behalf of the Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs, ap
peared before the Committee and
concluded his review of the author
ities' position with the statement
that the University will recognize
the election of no treasurer until an
amendment shall be appended to
the constitution making such
treasurer removable by the Uni
versity President. He also said
that the faculty was as yet unable
to report on the acceptability of the
names of H. W. Edwards, '01, and
Dave Brown, '97, who are the two
candidates mentioned for the treas
u rership.
In view of the situation, the ex
ecutive body very diplomatically
adjourned, after naming J. W.
Cameron, '03, C. A. Oantwell, '01,
and E. \V. Rice, '02, as a sub-com
mittee to draft the proposed amend
ment.
This afternoon, Professor Green,
in behalf of the Committee on
Student Affairs, sent President Mc-
Cormick the following communica
tion :
September 24, 1901.
Mr. M. I\ McCormick, President
Associated Students.
Dear Sir: Now that matters in
volving the former treasurer are
disposed of, the time seems to have
arrived for the discussion of means
by which such unfortunate affairs
may be avoided in the future.
The right of the committee or of
the President of the University to
remove from office the treasurer of
the Associated Students is formally
denied at the present time by the
association, as evidenced by the
resolutions recently passed. The
practical effect of this denial will
be to force the committee to bring
pressure on the student body to
dispose of an unacceptable official,
and this in turn will enable such
ofiicial to force the student body to
buy him off, all of which will in
terfere with the mutual co-opera
tion and good feeling which should
exist between students and faculty.
The Committee on Student Af
fairs considers it essential to have
this matter of authority over the
treasurer recognized before a new
treasurer is appointed, and to this
end has proposed an amendment
to the constitution of the associa
tion, a copy of which is enclosed.
The first sentence in this amend
ment recognizes the authority of
the President, and the remaining
sentences have been carefully
drawn by a member of the Law
Department to protect the associa
tion from any liability towards or
disagreement with the displaced
official.
You are requested to lay this
amendment before the student body

iit once, in order that student body
activities may return to the nor
mal channels as soon as possible.
Very truly yours,
R. L. Green,
Chairman Committee on
Student Affairs.
AMENDMENT TO CONSTITUTION.
Following is the amendment as
proposed by the faculty committee.
Add to Article II the following
section:
Sec. 6. —Every officer and agent
of this Association shall be elected
or appointed subject to the condi
tion that if he violates the rules of
the University or does that which
in the opinion of the President of
the University seriously prejudices
University discipline, his term of
oHice may be ended by the Presi
dent of the University. The pow
ers of such officer or agent may be
terminated by notice by mail or
otherwise, and within a reasonable
time thereafter he must deliver up
to the person named in such notice
all money, books, papers, and prop
erty of the Association in his cus
tody or possession and execute to
such nominee a proper transfer of
the right to possession of any
money or other property on de
positor not in his. 'possession to
which he is entitled by virtue of
his office or agency.
Every oflicer or agent of this As
sociation and all their acts and
contracts shall be subject to the
foregoing limitations.
