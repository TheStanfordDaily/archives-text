## Next Tuesday Will Be a Holiday. Stanford Opened Ten Years Ago. 
### 
All college work will be sus
pended on next Tuesday, October
Ist, and the day will be observed
as a holiday in honor of the tenth
anniversary of the opening of Stan
ford University to students. Ex
ercises, reproducing as nearly as
possible the program given at the
opening ten years ago, will take
place in the Assembly Hall in the
evening. A chorus, which meets
for practice next Monday evening
at the Presbyterian church, Palo
Alto, under directionof Mr. Morris,
will give the music. Rev. Rob
ert McKenzie of San Francisco,
who was present ten years ago, will
offer prayer and pronounce the
benediction, and the addresses de
livered by Senator Stanford, Presi
dent Jordan and others will be
read.
The complete program has not
been arranged. Director Morris is
anxious to have singers, especially
altos, meet at the chorus practice
next Monday evening.
