man to win sweaters at Stanford in
tennis, track, football and baseball.

Alaska, where he spent two years
in mining. From there he went to
Spokane, Washington, and became
interested in the real estate and oil
business. Last year he won the
championship of the state of Wash
ington in tennis, and also in the
tournament of the Pacific North

San Francisco, and after a short
visit in Pasadena will return to
his business at Spokane.
