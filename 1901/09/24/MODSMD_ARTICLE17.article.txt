Light Training Rules Signed.â€”Last
Night's Practice Fast and
Snappy.
Yesterday light training rules
were signed by the majority of the
football squad, and the rest of the
men will sign up today. The rules
are to the effect that the candidates
will implicitly obey the orders of
captain and coach, that they will
be out for signal and other practice
unless excused, that every man
will abstain from alcoholic liquors
and tobacco, that each will retire
regularly not later than 11 p.m.,
and will ohey all other rules made
by the trainer. These rules are, on
the whole, light and easy, but it is
understood that any infringement,
of them will immediately sever the
offender's connection with the
squad. The rules, with the names
of those signing, will be published,
in order that the student body may
know who have promised to train,
and may help them to keep their
promises.
Advisory rules are being formu
lated which it will not be needful
for the player to keep so strictly as
the others.
Last Night's Practice.
Yesterday afternoon the Varsity
lined up for the first time against
the second eleven. The big team
was composed of Boren, 1. e.,
Traeger, 1. t., Thompson, 1. g.,
Hauvermann, c., Barnhisel, r. g.,
McFadden, r. t., Cooper, r.e., Raitt,
q. b., Hill, 1. h., Smith, r. h.,
Slaker, 112. b. Their opponents were:
Butterfield, Ritchie, 1. e., Kuhn,
Lock wood, 1. t., Wells, Fredrick
son, 1. g., liayden, c., Moore, r. g.,
Dole, r. t., Nourse, r. e., Crawford,
q. b., Patterson 1. h., Frizzelle, r. h.,
Knight, Parker, 112. b. The work of
the Varsity was snappy and vigor
ous; they fought the second team,
which was heavily outclassed in
weight, down the held several times,
pushing Hill, Smith, and Slaker
forward with the ball by jumps of
several yards at a buck. Moulton
and Garth Parker, who watched
the practice, are greatly pleased
with the big team's work. All the
old men were in splendid form,
and Hauvermann, Barnhisel, and
Thompson, who have been added
this season, are showing up even
better than was expected.
