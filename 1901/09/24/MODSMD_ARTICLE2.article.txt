# NOURSE'S DEFENSE.
## Statements of Former Treasurer Conflict With Those Made by Faculty Committee. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As I have this day tendered my
resignation as treasurer of the
Associated Students, 1 wish to give,
as briefly as possible, a statement
of ray position. As yet I have said
nothing in defense of my action.
Professor Green and your paper
have done till the talking and have
made all the noise. Waiving any
criticism which your paper may
merit for trying to mix in the
affair, let us turn to the facts of
the case.
Firstly, the question of scholar
ship had nothing to do with the
case. When I accepted the ap
pointment in January, Professor
Gilbert promised me that he would
make no scholarship requirement
if the constitution of the associa
tion were amended; and I was
elected with that understanding.
Professor Gilbert denies this. The
members of last year's Executive
Committee are witnesses against
him, and to them 1 can refer any
one who questions this statement.
Those who are now in the Univer
sity are Gilman, Cantwell, Boren,
Sill, Treager and Haiti.
Professor Green states that he
also informed me that I could not
drop the work. I have never, at
any time, had any conversation
with Professor Green on this mat
ter. As he was not a member of
the Scholarship Committee, I knew
he could not have waived the re
quirement if he had wished to.
Having dropped the University
I work in good faith, there is no

justification of the committee's ac
tion in working out a suspension.
The offense which has brought
about Professor Green's opposition
to -me has nothing to do with my
scholarship. Last May, President
Marrack attempted to collect a bill
from the student body for his per
sonal expenses on a pleasure trip
to King's Mountain. When the
bill was presented to me I refused
payment, and Marrack then said
that he would " refer the matter to
Green,"and that "we will make
trouble for you." My reply was
complimentary neither to Marrack
nor Professor Green, and the next
day Professor Green took up the
tight against me and has been
fighting ever since.
In order to prejudice me in the
minds of the Stanford public he
circulated a false, malicious and
cowardly libel concerning me and
my connection with Professor Gil
bert's personal troubles. Professor
Green knew at the time that I had
had nothing to do with the story,
and brought me into it in order to
shield his friend Gilbert and to
injure me.
In thus withdrawing from my
position 1 do not yield to any show
or threat of power made by the
faculty committee. My position
was (irmly guarded by legal and
unassailable rights, by which I was
protected from al I the petty inter
ference of this committee. Every
opportunity has been given Pro
fessor Green to carry out his threat
to " force me out" by calling off
athletics. 1 would have resigned
at the opening of the semester if 1
had not heard this bluff from the
professor. I felt then it was my
duty to remain and call the bluff,
in order to show that the student
body was run on business prin
ciples and that its legal rights
could not be interfered with by the
faculty committee. The matter
was put up to this committee and
it crawfished beautifully, which
should settle once for all any fur
ther question of authority over
student body affairs.
The whole action of the com
mittee is at variance with the very
charter of the University, which
provides that the students shall
have 14 the largest measure of lib
erty consistent with good scholar
ship." Instead of this liberty the
students are interfered with and
burdened with a. surfeit of faculty
molestation which serves only to
widen the breach between faculty
and students and to place the latter
in the position of inmates of a
penal reformatory.
The expressions of confidence on
the part of the students and the
assurances of friendship and sup
port which have come to me, un
solicited, from members of the fac
ulty outside of the narrow circle
controlled by the chairman of the
Students' Affairs Committee, have
almost moved me to remain and
keep up the light, but the knowl
edge that by so doing the students
who are under the control of the
committee will be the only suffer
ers, and that the hopes of the Car
dinal in the forthcoming contests
may be shattered, impels me to
tender my resignation.
Having demonstrated the in

ability of Professor Green and his
student attaches, Marrack, Mo
Cormick, et al., to force me out of
the position, my object in remain
ing lias been accomplished.
In accepting the compromise
offered by the Executive Com
mittee I feel that I have been fair
with the committee, as the great
part of the work* of the office has
been done during the four past
months.
Believing that I have done my
duty to the student body, my satis
faction is in the support the stu
dents have given me, and (he
enmity ] have incurred with the
small band of knockers who have
endeavored to injure me.
John T. Nourse.
