and promising Class of '05 to order
this afternoon in the chapel, and,
amid hearty applause, Wertheiiner
and Nabs were nominated for
president, Klein for vice-president,
Peet and Reynolds for secretary,
and Finney for treasurer.
After this meeting the class,
thinking that the above nomina

rude and noisy sophomores, held
another meeting, which was called
to order by F. A. Brown, '02.
Finney was elected president, much
enthusiasm being displayed by
those present; in accepting the
nomination he made a very inter
esting and affecting speech, which
was much appreciated by those
present. Wisehart, Henderson,
Wertheimer, and Oscar Beiver
were nominated for vice-president,
Beiver being elected. Recond and
Rufus Green were nominated for
secretary, Green being elected;
Smith, Root and Crabb were nomi
nated for treasurer, and Crabb was
elected. Recond and Finney were
also made members of the Execu
tive Committee of the student body.
After a burst of melody from
the try-out for the Freshman
Glee Club, Prof. C. H. Gil
bert was made sergeant-at-arms.
Mr. Finney was later in re
ceipt of a letter from President
Jordan, congratulaling him on the
high honor to which lie had been
called, and inviting the happy
fellow to meet him and his family
at dinner tonight at Xazmin
House. When Finney went to
thank the President for the invita
tion that gentleman placed his
strong, warm hand on the Fresh
man's shoulder and said, l< It's
only a bluff, my boy; only a bluff."
Hut Finney is happy. He is presi
dent of the Class of 1905.
