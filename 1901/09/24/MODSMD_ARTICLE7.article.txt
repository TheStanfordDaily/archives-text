The Daily Palo Alto takes
exception to a few of the state
ments in the communication of
John T. Nourse, but does not care
to continue the controversy. The
only reason for "mixing in the
affair" was the belief that it was
to the interest of the Associated
Students for Nourse to resign; that
a speedy settlement of the difficulty
was of vital importance to our
athletics. When it became evi
dent that Nourse could not remain
in office without endangering the
athletic prospects for the year,
when he failed to recognize this
crisis, when he insisted that the
matter was purely personal in its
relations, and refused to resign be
cause of a personal prejudice
against a few members of the
faculty, then, and not until then,
did the Daily Palo Alto take ac
tion against him.
Nourse, as a man, holds our re
spect and sympathy. Nothing
could have been more gratifying to
the student body than to have had
him remain in office, circumstances
being altered. However, bv resign
ing earlier he would not have left
himself open to condemning criti
cism, and would have freed the
Associated Students from an em
barrassing position. If any one
who has read the accounts from
the standpoint of the Faculty Com
mittee will carefully compare them
with statements in this issue, he
will readily conclude that one side
or the other is mistaken. We will
not presume to pass judgment.
Our object, in so far as it concerned
the student body, is accomplished:
Nourse has resigned.
