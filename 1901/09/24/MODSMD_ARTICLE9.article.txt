â€” For those interested in the
beauties of Italian mosaic there is
a rare opportunity to investigate
this subject. One point, which is
very essential to such a step, how
ever, is, you must speak Italian.
Some very beautiful mosaic is be
ing unpacked in the electrical
power-house. The scenes por
trayed are taken from great paint
ings in the Sistine Chapel, Rome,
by special permission of the I'ope.
They are to ornament the walls of
the Memorial Chapel in the near
future. Several Italian artists
who are unable to speak English
are here now superintending the
unpacking. The scenes are mostly
biblical, such as "Judas Kissing
the Savior," "The Lord's Supper,"
and many others of great interest.
The color scheme is wonderful for
those not conversant with such
things. Many of the figures are
underlaid with gold leaf to give the
rich, ripe straw color so much
prized. There are ten large boxes
containing mosaic, only one of
which has so far been unpacked.
