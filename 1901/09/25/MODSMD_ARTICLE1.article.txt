# GRIDIRON WORK.
## Last Night's Practice Good, but More Men Are Badly Needed in the Line-ups. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon, after signal
practice and the usual catching
and running with the ball, and
some light work in tackling, the
Varsity lined up against the second
eleven, the big team being composed
of Boren, 1. e.; Traeger, 1.1.; Thomp
son, 1. g.; Hauverman, c.; Barn
hisel, r. g.; "Guiby" Dole, r. t.;
Cooper, r. e.; Raitt, q.b.; Hill, 1. h.;
Smith, r. h.; Slaker, 112. b.; while the
other was formed by Lutgerding,
1. e.; Lock wood, 1. t.; Fredrickson,
1. g.; Hayden, c.; Moore, r. g.; Tal
bot, r. t.; Nourse, r. e.; Crawford,
q. 1).; Patterson, 1. h.; Frisselle, r. h.;
Knight Parker, 112." b. McFadden
was not out because of a sprained
knee. Captain Fisher coached the
men of the second team. The work
of the Varsity was up to its usual
form, however, and the practice was
sharp, hard, and snappy. " Dad "
Moulton says that they play fiercer
ball than an}' team be has ever
known, except that of Wisconsin,
lie said: "If these fellows don't
wax Berkeley in the big game, 1
don't know a team; that's all.
There isn't a quitter in the whole
bunch."
On the big team the remarkably
high average of work makes it hard
to pick out any one man's perform
ances for commendation, but the
three new men, Hauverman, who is
putting up a good game in spite of
the fact that he never had a job at
center before; Barnhisel, steady and
reliable; and Thompson with his
dogged courage, would seem to war
rant prophecying them permanent
places on the Varsity line; while
liaitt, Traeger, Boren, Cooper, Hill,
Smith and Slaker are playing the
same old game â€”a little better per
haps even now, in that they played
last year. "Guiby" Dole is at
every practice coming up to the
form he showed in his freshman
year. While Traeger's playing
does not show up so well to the
crowd as that of the men behind
the line, it is there just the same,
and the words of an onlooker
voiced Stanford's sentiment the
other evening when he said, "I'm
mighty glad we didn't lose him."
One thing is certain, however;
that is that the second team can
not nearly hold the big team.
Nearly all the individual work is
good, and Butterfield, Crawford,
Kuhn, Nourse, Hayden and Pat
terson did some playing last night
that was far above the average; but
the loss of Hauverman, Barnhisel,
Thompson and Boren has robbed it
of much of its weight, and while it
has lost none of its courage, it can
not yet stop up the Varsity. With
six men added in last night's prac
tice the bucks and end runs of
Traeger, Cooper, Hill, Slaker, and
Smith went through fairly easily.
It is something of a disgrace to
the class of '05 that its members
are not out sooner each evening
and in greater numbers for prac
tice. Last night there were not
enough fresh men out for two teams,
and the coaches had to mix second
team men up with them to make
enough for a freshman line-up.

However, Roosevelt of Lake Forest
will l>e out today, Witzman re
turned from liin home in the city
last night, and it is said that
lloran will don canvas this week.
On the whole, the work of the
squad is quite up to the average.
All the men are as yet a little weak
in the wind, hut the hard, consist
ent work of Coach Fickert will soon
remedy that. Trainer Moulton
says he will have the big fellows in
fairly good shape for the game
with the Olympics on the campus
next Saturday.
