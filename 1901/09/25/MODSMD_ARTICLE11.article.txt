Today we publish a plan of
managing our athletics which com
mends itself to the consideration of
every member of the Associated
Students. It is proposed by men
of the student body who have been
intimately connected with college
activities and closely identified
with our athletic interests. They
are eminently qualified by experi
ence and ability to deal with this
subject.
Our constitution, as it now reads,
is a scrapbook of amendments.
Its original plan has been com
pletely altered within the past few
years, and a ragged patchwork of
clauses is all that is left. The
change from the former system of
undergraduate managers to one
graduate manager has practically
nullified the old constitution. As
it now exists it is both indefinite
and incomplete.
The embarrassment that has
arisen through our present arrange
ment will not be wholly obviated
by amendments that the Faculty
Committee may presume to propose
from time to time. Besides, this is
a student body enterprise in which
student body interests are at stake.
The Daily Palo Alto believes that
the crises should be met and settled
by the student body, and not by
the Faculty Committee. As a tem
porary expediency it will be neces
sary to adopt the amendment as
proposed by the Faculty. But we
do not need it as a permanent fix
ture. Let us wipe the slate clean
and begin anew.
