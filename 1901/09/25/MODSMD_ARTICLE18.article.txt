# 1902 FINANCES.
## Senior Class Financial Prospects Are Exceptionally Bright. 
### 
When I was elected treasurer of
the Class of 1902 last Christmas,
ex-Treasurer Chadbourne turned
over to nie $72. At present the
class has $523.20 and a part is
bringing in interest; $23.20 is in
the bank and thefssoo was loaned
to the student body the 9th of May
through Treasurer J. T. Nourse.
Mr. Nourse, as treasurer, gave a
note for that amount to the Class
of '02. This .$5OO in bringing in
interest at 5 per cent, per annum
and is due six months from the
date of the loan—that is, it will
be paid principal and interest on
or before the 9th of November,
1901.
The interest will amount to a
little over $12. So when this is
paid over to the class in November
we shall have about $536. There
are no bills whatever against the
class, and the expenses of our first
semester are very light, so the
prospects for Senior Week are ex
ceptionally bright. We have ac
cumulated more money than any
other class in any period of its ca
reer in the history of Stanford.
I have turned over to Treasurer
Dryer $23.20 and the interest
bearing note for $500.
