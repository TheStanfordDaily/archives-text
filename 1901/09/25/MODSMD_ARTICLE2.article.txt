Across the bay they are busy
trying to fill up the depleted ranks
of last year with the somewhat
unpromising material at hand.
Wotnble, Dibble and Hudson, ends;
Stowe and Overall, guards; Albert
son and Hansen, tackles; More,
quarter; Duden, full; and Mini,
half, played in the last Thanks
giving game, or were substitutes.
The other positions will probably
be filled by Gendotti, center; and
Whipple or Sherman, halfback.
There are also several freshmen of
promise, but it is too early to pick
out the tnen of varsity size as
yet.
The first regular game is sched
uled for Saturday, with Reliance,
and the outlook is not very en
couraging to the collegians, as the
club men have practically the same
team as last year.
The freshmen will play a prac
tice game with the Berkeley High
School on Saturday, and the first
regular game with the St.
Matthew's School, October 2d.
