# ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.
## Proposed Plan for Future Management of All Our Athletics. 
### 
The Nourse controversy has been
a fruitful source of discussion re
garding our present methods of
athletic management. Under our
centralized system the management
of athletics must always depend
upon the vagaries of student body
politics, and a business-like ad
ministration cannot be assured
from year to year.
To avoid the difficulties that
have confronted us in the past
under our much amended constitu
tion the following plan is sub
mitted for the consideration and
discussion of the student body.
Let there be organized a corpor
ation known as the "Stanford Uni
versity Athletic Association," with
its capital stock divided into one
hundred shares. This corporation
can be organized and ready for
business within two weeks, at a
cost of about $25.
Let the stock of the corporation
be divided among persons living in
the following places, approximately
as follows: The fraternities, 2
each, 24; Encina Hall, 24; Palo
Alto, 15; Mayfield and College
Terrace, 8; San Jose and Santa
Clara, 8; The Camp, 7; Alumni, 8;
Faculty, 6; total, 100.
Let the above 100 members
choose a board of directors from
among their number, as follows:
Undergraduates, 3; Alumni, 2;
Faculty, 2; total, 7.
This board of- 7 directors will
have authority to appoint all the
officers necessary to manage the
athletics of Stanford University, to
fix their salaries, to prescribe their
duties and to have full power of
removal, whenever, in their opin
ion, such action is necessary.
At the beginning of each college
year the members of the associa
tion will meet and fill all vacancies
caused by graduation, etc., by
electing members from the student
body. It has been suggested that
none but those who have full junior
standing be eligible to membership
in the athletic association.
This plan will place the athletics
of the University in the hands of
those who .are most interested in
their welfare. Since the greater
part of the one hundred members
will not leave in any one year there
will be secured a continuance of
management that has heretofore
been sadly lacking at Stanford.
