# NEBRASKA DEBATE.
## Question of a Contest This Year Again Up for Consideration. 
### 
At the call of President ltice,
the Executive Committee (if the
Inter-society Debating League met
this afternoon to consider the ques
tion of arranging a debate with the
University of Nebraska. The sub
ject was brought up by a letter
from P. B. Weaver, president of the
Nebraska University Debating As
sociation, of which the following
extracts give the substance:
''Last winter and spring there
was correspondence between our
respective debating associations rel
ative to a debate between Leland
Stanford Junior University and the
University of Nebraska. Owing to
unfortunate delays, however, the en
gagement entered into was can
celled by Nebraska's executive
committee, for reasons shown by
the correspondence of last spring,
namely, fear of a financial failure
by some, owing to the necessary
conflict of date with final examina
tions.
"Nebraska desires the debate
with your league this year, prefer
ably there. Our league now de
bates with Colorado, Kansas and
Missouri Universities, the place of
debate alternating each year. This
year we expect to entertain Colo
rado and Kansas at home. Next
year we will only have Missouri.
If you could entertain our team
this year we can manage to return
the favor next year."
After discussing the letter in the
meeting, the committee, by a vote,
expressed its desire to hold the Ne
braska debate, upon condition that
it take place some time this se
mester. Scott and Cameron were
appointed to lay the matter before
the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students, tonight, to
ascertain its attitude, if it is found
feasible to negotiate an engage
ment, place and date for holding it
will be determined later.
