# EDWARDS CHOSEN TREASURER
## Nourse's Successor Provisionally Elected by Student Executive Committee. 
### 
Harry J. Edwards, '01, is to he
our graduate manager for the re
mainder of the college year. Such
is the result of the election held hy
the Executive Committee last night.
The only other candidate was Dave
Brown, '97, the vote standing five
to four in Edwards' favor.
The news of the election comes
somewhat as a surprise. It was
generally known among the stu
dents that the faculty had refused
to recognize any treasurer until the
amendment giving the University
President power of removal should
he added to the constitution. But
yesterday the authorities consented
to a provisional election, whereby
the man chosen should hold office
temporarily until the amendment
was passed, at which time lie will
assume full power.
The committee accepted the con
ditions, and proceeded to elect as
above. Reckoning on a basis of a
salary of .$lOOO a year for twelve
months, they tixed Edwards' com
pensation at per month
until June Ist, when his term ex
pires.
The new treasurer has done con
siderable in the oversight of ath
letics, having managed and cap
tained the Varsity baseball team,
on which he played as shortstop
and third baseman for four seasons.
While ;in undergraduate his major
work was in history. He is a mem
ber of the Sigma Rho Eta fratern
ity and lives in San Diego.
The advisability of taking up
with Nebraska's offer for an inter
collegiate debate was discussed by
the committee, but nothing definite
was arrived at.
It was voted to let the scenery in
Assembly Hall for .$35, as hereto
fore, and to allow the band $10 for
music.
