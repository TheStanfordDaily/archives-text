Armour Institute, with a fund of
$3,000,000, will probably go to Chi
cago University within a short time.
The Armour Institute lias 88 pro
fessors and 1000 students. During
the last live years tbe University
of Chicago has absorbed or affilia
ted nineteen schools, not including
A rniour Institute.
Michigan University has (his
summer erected a building at a cost
of $100,000, which will relieve the
crowded condition of her bacteri
ological and histological laborato
ries. It is hoped in the near
future to erect a large general build
ing, costing $800,000, plans for
which have already been drawn.
The University of I'ennsylvnnia
has taken the preliminary steps
necessary for the erection of a new
medical laboratory, which in point
of completeness and equipment
will be not only unexcelled, but, il
is confidently believed, in advance
of any similar building now in
existence, in this country or in Eu
rope. The object of this laboratory
will be to afford the most modern
and favorable opportunities for the
teaching of the subjects of physi
ology, pathology, and pharmaco
dynamics to students of medicine.
Deep gloom prevails in tbe ranks
of the co-eds in Illinois colleges.
From Champaign, Galesburg, .Jack
sonville, Chicago and North western,
comes an indignant wail of protest.
One of the college customs most
sacred in the eyes of the col lege girl
is the wearing over her breast of a
jeweled emblem of a college secret
society, presented by the young
man of her favor and esteem. Now,
the new law which has just received
Gov. Yates' signature, prohibits per
sons from wearing the buttons,
badges and emblems of secret so
cieties and orders of which they are
not members.
At the University of Pennsyl
vania a club of tall men has been
formed. The twelve tallest men in
the university only are eligible.
There is, however, an associate
membership of the next longest
twelve, from which members will be
promoted to the higher organiza
tion if a vacancy occurs or sufficient
increased stature is shown by the
associates. The society has, how
ever, a limit of eighty feet of mem
bership. The officers are "Moon
Hitter," "Sky Scraper," "Ceiling
Duster," and "Giraffe." A quorum
consistsof thirty-seven feet of mem
bers. The club plans, it is said, to
give a dance in the near future, to
which no lady exceeding live feet
in height will lie invited.
