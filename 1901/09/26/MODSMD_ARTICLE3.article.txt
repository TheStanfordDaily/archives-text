# Encina Gymnasium.
## 
### 
Work in Encina gymnasium is
progressing rapidly. 852 students
have registered in the different
classes, and the work has heen di
vided into sections for different
kinds of appartus and outdoor
work. A lmsehall squad is at
work each day, and, in addition to

this, men for appartus work are
separated into squads of four, for
systematic all-round work.
Poor water is the one great ex
ception to the progress. Encina
gymnasium is the only building
on the campus that is not con
nected with the water pipes of the
new reservoir.
A new rule will go into effect
next week, providing that ail
tardinesses shall count the same as
" cuts" and can only he removed
hy an hour's extra work for each
offense.
