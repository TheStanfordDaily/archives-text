Father Thomas J. Slnthan,of the
Catholic University at Washing
ton, J). C., came down yesterday
afternoon from San Francisco,
where he is giving a series of lec
tures in Metropolitan Hall, and
addressed the students on " Ideal
ism in Education."
In his opening remarks he spoke
of the statement made by Professor
H. Morse Stephens in the chapel
last week, that "America's religion
is education," and urged that that
religion be elevated to its highest
ends. Commenting on the various
fields of learning existing in the
universities of today, he pointed
out the efficiency each branch
would gain if spirituality were
made a part of the investigator's
possessions. Theology, he affirmed,
is a science, and should be given
the prominence which it deserves.
Presidents McKinley and Itoose
velt, Father Shahan cited as ex
amples of statesmen who have
become universally honored be
cause of their devotion to idealism
in government. " Not to serve
man, but humanity," he declared,
"is the lesson of idealism. He who
heeds it goes through life with
Christ himself, doing good."
