In last night'H line-up of the
Varsity against the second team,
the scrubs played much better
ball than they have heretofore in
this season. The line-up of the
big team was practically the same
as before, the only difference being
that McFadden was back at his
old stand, and that Slaker's place
at full was taken by Paul Parker.
Captain Fisher will be put into the
line-up either today or tomorrow,
but Fickert will not let him play
until a specially devised harness
for the speedy half's shoulder has
arrived from the city, as the coach
does not wish to risk crippling his
man. Kisher will play in his old
position in Saturday's game, and
both Hill and Smith will be tried
as the other halfback. It is the
opinion of men who ,know that the
Olympics, even with Kaarsberg
and Smith behind their line, can
not outclass the Stanford backs.
Slaker's hard, consistent work at
full, Haiti's hustling, heady play
at quarter, and the splendid, whirl
wind runs of Fisher, Hill, and
Smith at half, will be hard for any
team to beat. Slaker yesterday
openly expressed his admiration of
the snappy play done by the Var
sity this season, and said that it
outclassed any team he had ever
seen, except Chicago.
Among the noticeable features of
the practice ldst night were Raitt's
35-yard run with the ball through
a held crowded with tacklers;
Traeger gave a similar exhibition
later; Cooper made one or two line
end runs; and iiill dashed almost
the entire length of the lield, behind
Traeger's and Raitt's interference.
For the opposing team Allen did
good work in breaking through the
line and tackling; Preston blocked
well; Nourse made a good end run;
and Professor hewers lined up as
right guard and played hard ball
to the tune of "Knock Lewers
down, Thompson!" Preston aud
Kuhn, who will, it is said, play
fullback 011 the second team at the
next practice, as Knight is trying
for end, made several good
tackles; one of Smith, which was
especially quick and hard. Craw
ford, the second eleven quarter,
made a. good run following the
first team's kick off, and Shields
ran twenty yards through a full
field.
John T. Nourse has received of
fers of positions 011 both the Olym
pic and Reliance teams, accepting
that of the former, for which he and
Garth Parker will prove a pair ol
speedy ends. A few more Fresh
men were out last night than be
fore, but many seem sadly afflicted
with "cold feet." It is the lasting
shame of the Class of 15)05 that it
should be the first in the history
of Stanford to fail to turn out for

the class team. The Freshmen who
are out will stay with it, and they
are all good men, hut there are not
enough of them to make two good
line-ups. The following men
formed the first line-up, which
played the Palo Alto picked team
this afternoon: Sefton, 1. e., Still
man, 1. t., Van Sickle, 1. g., Mont
zingo, c., Nissen, r. g., (jJalbraith,
r. t., WilT)ur, r. e., Taylor, q. b.,
Tarpey, 1. h. 112 Trowbridge, r. h., and
Dole, 112. h. All of the Freshmen,
however, will probably have a
chance to play.
Yesterday the training rules,
which will he strictly enforced,
were signed by the men trying for
positions. They were prepared by
Coacl'i Fickert and approved by
Trainer Moulton, and'read as fol
lows:
