# AMENDMENT OPPOSED.
## Radical Stand of the Faculty Meets with Serious Objections on the Part of an Alumnus. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Ah one win) formerly took an ac
tive part in student interests, I will
be greatly obliged if you will pub
lish the enclosed letter.
To my mind, the enforcement
of the proposed amendment will
work a very great injury to the
University. Student organiza
tions are the laboratories of stu
dents of history and economics.
The adoption of the theory of the
divine origin of species in the bio
logical laboratory would be no
more harmful than the adoption of
the proposed amendment. Such
an unnatural system will only
foster unnatural abuses, which in
turn will call for unnatural cor
rectives.
It is very much to be regretted
that affairs have reached the pres
ent stage. I sincerely hope that
the faculty will be satisfied with
holding student body officers to
strict account, without exercising
any prerogatives in elections, which
the amendment is sure to lead to.
Trusting that you will find space
for my article and that the faculty
will recede from their present
radical position, 1 am,
Very truly yours,
E. R. Zion.

Associated Students:
If you adopt the amendment
proposed by the faculty, you may
be assured of a long line of in
competents. A system similar in
principle, though not in detail, al
most depopulated Encina in '95.
The students elected five candidates
from whom the faculty chose one,
to serve on a committee in charge
of the hall. If a candidate had
the ability and took the interest to
advocate improvement, the faculty
invariably overlooked him in mak
ing their appointment. It soon
came about that the most capable
students for that position refused
to be candidates, knowing that
they would be unacceptable to the
faculty. Self-constituted power
seldom has any use for men of in
dependence and aggressiveness.
The result was that students in an
unofficial capacity discovered a
"leakage" of about $200 per month
under student officials selected by
the faculty, and the steward who
was responsible was discharged.
If the amendment is adopted, it
is doubtful if the faculty will ever
remove any officials. But its evil
influence will be felt in the selec
tion of candidates and their con
stant " trimming." Already Pro
fessor Green is reported as telling
your Executive Committee that he
can not yet report on the " accept
ability" of two rival candidates.
This may be only a blind with re
gard to one of them, for he gener
ally mismanaged things suf
ficiently during inv time to suit the
faculty.
If the amendment prevails, your
officials will be subject to two mas
ters, and one of them knows very
little about the business to be done,
and that one is the faculty.
"Know a great deal about some
one thing and a little about many
things," says Dr. Jordan. Stu
dent organizations are among the
things about which the faculty
knows "a little." You who take
part and who discuss matters every

day, on the campus, in the quad,
and in your rooms, are the only
competent judges of candidates and
the laws of your organizations.
If you wish to have your affairs
perpetually mismanaged and place
yourselves where you can not
remedy them, give a portion of the
elective power to tiie faculty. Such
was the condition in Eneina, until
the dining feature had to he
abolished. Better give the faculty
full management, for "occasionally
there are good kings."
Your organizations are the labo
ratories of history and economics.
The adoption of the- principle pro
posed by the faculty would work
as much mischief in your organi
zations as would the adoption of
the principle of the divine origin of
species in Dr. Gilbert's laboratory.
