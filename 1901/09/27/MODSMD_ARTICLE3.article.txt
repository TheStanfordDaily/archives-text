## Freshman Game in Detail.—Bayard Nourse Injured in Last Night's Practice. 
### 
Tomorrow the first Varsity game
of the season will be played on our
campus. The line-up of the Stan
ford eleven will be the same as in
last night's practice, with the ex
ception of the half positions, which
will be filled by Fisher, Hill, or
Smith. Manager Muma of the
Olympics was unable to give the
line-up of the club men when seen
last night. The game will be called
at 3:30 p.m.
In yesterday's cam pus game be
tween the Stanford Freshmen and
a picked team from Palo Alto, the
line-up was as follows:
STANFORD. PALO ALTO.
o , p L C. F. Jordan
Sefto " |C \ I'orter
Stillman It Dudley
Van Sickle ....lg Spalding
Montzingo c Meyers
Nissen r g Towle
Galbraith r t Kaiser
t.r-n McLachlan
W,lb,,r ? Barber
Taylor qb Buelna
»>
Trowbridge r h.. C. li. Jordan
Dole 112 b Swain
Following Stanford's kick-off, the
Palo Alto team, being unable to
make any gain in the first two
downs, kicked to fullback Dole,
who made a ten-yard* run. Stan
ford then advanced the ball by a
series of steady bucks, losing it on
a fumble. Jordan, halfback of the
visiting team, made one or two
good bucks, but Paul Tarpey stole
the sphere and made a short run,
Stanford then using him and Joe
Sefton in a series of good center
bucks and end runs, Palo Alto
holding better than before. Stan
ford lost the ball again, and the
Palo Alto boys made two fruitless
bucks and kicked, Tarpey making
a twenty-yard run on them and the
Cardinal youngsters bucking up to
a touchdown near the end of the
first half, Tarpey kicking the goal.
The rest of the half was spent in
useless attempts by the visitors to
carry the ball to Stanford's goal
line. Score, 6 to 0.
At the beginning of the second
half Palo Alto's kick was caught by
Doherty from Portland High, who
made a pretty run; Palo Alto get
ting the ball on a foul, lost two
yards, but Jordan was sent in for a
four-yard buck, and later Burke
made ten yards. The ball, going
to Stanford on "a fumble, was
pushed forward by steady shoves.
A few more fumbles, a few good
runs by halfback Jordan, several
tackles by Dole and Sefton, and
Stanford was forcing her opponent
backward by jumps of from two to
ten yards. The game was called
off to allow the practice of the big
team. On the whole, the over
confidence of the infants is respon
sible for much of their ragged
work. While their individual play
ing is good, and Van Sickle, Wil
bur, Sefton, Dole, and Tarpey
played good ball, there was little
team work or enthusiasm. The
visitors' game was extremely lop

sided, several of their team doing
good work, among these being C. H.
Jordan, Burke, and Towle, but for
a team in as poor condition as
theirs (several of their men, by the
way, came on the field chewing to
bacco) to hold down a University
class team to six points is a good
record. When the Freshmen play
Santa Ciara, which waxed the Palo
Alto High to the tune of 22 to 0
last week, the winning team will
not be bard to pick.
The Varsity line-up was the
same as usual, except that Kulin
and Cooper played in Cooper's
place at right end, and Parker held
right half. The practice was by
far the best held this season on the
gridiron, the Varsity playing its
usual fierce, quick game, and the
scrubs holding their line extremely
well. Kuhn and Parker, who were
tried last night, proved themselves
to be active and steady, and their
progress will be watched with in
terest.
Just before work was stopped for
the evening, Raitt, who was tearing
around the Varsity right end with
the hall, collided with " Baldy"
Nourse, who had dashed over from
the right end of the second eleven.
Just as Nourse dived for a tackle
of the runner, "Stub" ducked,
his helnieted head striking that of
his opponent. Nourse was un
conscious for several minutes, fin
ally being carried off the field to
the training-house, where he has
lain for some time in a state of
semi-consciousness. Dr. Wilbur,
who was called, stated the injury
to be quite dangerous, but today
the sufferer has rallied from the
shock and is resting easily. The
sphenoid portion of the temporal
bone was broken at the base of the
brain by the force of the shock. In
the opinion of Dr. Wilbur and Dr.
Stillman, who was called from the
city, unless complications arise
Nourse will recover in good shape.
There are no bad symptoms as yet,
and, if he continues to improve, he
will he out of danger in three or
four days. The only danger now
is that from meningitis.
