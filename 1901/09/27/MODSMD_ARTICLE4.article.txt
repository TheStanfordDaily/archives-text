The summer school held at Pa
cific Grove this summer, which
is a part of the University work,
was in all respects a decided suc
cess. The term lasted from June
tenth to July twentieth.
Pacific Grove is especially well
fitted for the kind of work which is
carried on there, as the quantity
and quality of material gathered is
of the very finest-
Courses in zoology, histology,
embryology, and ornithology were
given this summer. Naples is the
only other place in the world which
is as good as Pacific Grove or ex
cels it in opportunities of labora
tory and research work. For these
reasons the summer school has al
ways been a decided success in
every way. There were about fifty
students enrolled the past summer.
The classes in zoology and embry
ology were under Prof. (J. C. Price;
histology was given by Professor
McFarland; botany was given by
Professor Peirce, and the class in
ornithology was under Mr. Joseph
Grinnell. The assistants in the

various departments were: A. \V.
Baird and J. F. Illingsworth in
Zoology I; Victor Cagliere in Kin
bryology; J. F. illingsworth in
Histology; and M. 11. Spaulding,
Allen and Nelson an general assist
ants and collectors.
