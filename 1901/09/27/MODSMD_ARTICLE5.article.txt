# DR. DEAN LECTURES.
## Gives Interesting Descriptions and Shows Views from the Orient. 
### 
Dr. Bashford Dean of the zoology
department at Columbia Univer
sity, who has just returned from
spending a year in Japan, lectured
in the chapel last night upon " A
Naturalist in Japan and the Philip
pines." Dr. Dean was engaged in
collecting for his research work
specimens of fish life which are ob
tainable only near Tokio. In
Japan the zoologist finds an ex
ceedingly rich field and European
scientists have brought many rare
things from there. Immediately off
the shore the water is so deep that
the life ordinarily confined to the
waters of mid-ocean, such as the
glass sponge, may be secured near
shore. The land is also rich in
subjects for the study of bird life
ami mammals. All Japanese
people are naturalists to a more or
less extent, developing from youth
an unusual familiarity with the
species of animals in their own
vicinity.
Dr. Dean showed a number of
interesting stereopticon views of the
surroundings in which he worked
and the places he visited in Japan
and the Philippines. One was a
picture taken at Misalci, of the sea
side laboratory at which he and
Dr. Jordan were associated together
for a while in their investigations.
This is located on a peninsula, ex
tending out by a beautiful little
bay. The speaker related anecdotes
of legends connected with the his
tory of this peninsula. Another
picture gave an inside view of the
zoological laboratory of the Tokio
University, which is simiiar in ar
rangement to the German lab.
An interesting view was that of an
establishment where gold fish are
propagated, showing a series of
artificial ponds and the buildings
used in connection with the indus
try. This establishment has been
kept under control of one family
for two hundred and thirty years.
The propagation and raising of
different varieties of this fish is as
important a business as that for
the growth of an}' species of ani
mal in this country. Some kinds
of the highly developed Japanese
gold fish are worth as much as $50.
Dr. Dean exhibited views of
â€¢Japanese fishermen and their boats,
pictures of a similar nature taken
on the island of Negros, in the
Philippines, and many others of
interest.
