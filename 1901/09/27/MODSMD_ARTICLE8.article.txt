Today's communication, in bo
fan- as it objects to the faculty's
directing student body policy, is in
accord with views of many under
graduates. However, we cannot
afford to be blinded to the situa
tion by what Mr. Zion says. He
is, presumably, not acquainted
with all the circumstances.
The Faculty decrees that, since
we have shown onr incompetence
to dispose of an official who does not,
comply with rules for University
government, they will not allow us
to have one unless we place the ulti
mate power of removal in the Pres
ident of the University.
There is no danger of this power
being exercised, except in extreme
cases. The athletic season is upon
us. We cannot be impeded in any
way without practically abandon
ing it. Whatever our opinion may
be of the theoretical wisdom of this
amendment, we must now accept
the situation as it is, and adopt it.
When the football season has
passed and we have leisure to study
out plans for the future, we shall
then set to work to devise some
scheme for better administration of
our affairs. The proposed plan of
a Stanford University athletic as
sociation was published two days
ago with this idea in view. By
passing the amendment now we
will gain time for perfecting this
new system of management, and
our athletic season will be success
fully finished. By opposing it we
will endanger our own interests
without gaining any advantage.
