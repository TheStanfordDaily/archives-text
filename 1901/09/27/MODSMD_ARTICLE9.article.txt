All persons should remember
that Bayard F. Nourse, who was
injured on the football field last
evening, lies in a dangerous condi
tion at the training-house. We
can best lend our assistance to his

recovery by causing as little noise
as possible in this vicinity, and by
staying away from the bouse unless
called there on business.
