111 contemplating tlie purchase of a typewriter, you naturally ask:
Must I lift up the carriage every time I wish to see what I have writ
ten ?
Will the alignment be perfect and permanent, or will it in a few
months produce ragged, unsightly work, similar to the so-called "Dollar
Typewriter''.?
Will it ink perfectly and evenly, or will the ribbon soon wear out in
spots and m ike my work lojk like variegated wall-paper ?
Must I be restricted to the use of but one style of type for all work,
or can I make a rapid change from one to another ?
Must I be condemned to use but the one spacing width, single, double
triple, or can I graduate it to suit myself, and automatically strike the
line each time I press the spacing lever ?
If I wish to make eight or ten copies, must I re-write the letter sev
eral times, or can I make them all with one impression ?
Must I spend from thirty to fort}' minutes cleaning the type, or can
I do it in two minutes ?
Will it last, or shall I have to get a new machine within a year or so?
If simplicity is strength in mechanics, will not a machine having but 250
parts, though capable of doing all the work desired of it, last longer and
wear better, than one containing from 1800 to 2300?
AND IF I can get a Blickensderfer for $50 which has all the good
points of other machines and a few of its own, wouldn't I be foolish to
spend $100 for any of the so-called "Standard Machines" simply because
my friend Jones, or my friend Brown's friend, possesses one?
Wouldn't it be foolish to throw away that fifty just to be able to say,
"I have one like Jones's," etc.?
AND wouldn't it be a good idea for ine to enquire into this and find
out what the BLICKENSDERFER machine really is?
Probably you haven't time to call ; if so, drop a card to Harry C.
Peterson, at either the University or Palo Alto, aiul he will call 011 you
any evening during the week.
