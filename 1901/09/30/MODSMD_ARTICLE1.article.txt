# VARSITY WINS.
## Stanford Defeats Olympics in the First Game of the Season. 
### 
Saturday afternoon, on the home
campus, Stanford's Varsity football
team defeated the Olympic Clubby
a score of 6 to 0, the Cardinals
playing a hard, quick game against
superior • weight and experience.
For the first game of the season
there was remarkably little fumb
ling or ragged play on the side of
the home team, and it was fully
demonstrated that there is much
good football material in its
ranks.
It is to be regretted that serious
questions arose during the game
as to the justness of Referee Pres
cott's decisions, and that one or
two of the wearers of the winged
"()" seemed more anxious to
" win, tie, or wrangle," than to
play square ball. It was also
noticeable that the bleachers were
seriously discourteous to Stanford's
visitors, never praising their work
or giving them a courtesy yell.
Apart from these things the game
was a good one and well fought.
The line of red-shirts held well and
the backs were quick, heady and
reliable. Barnhisel, at right guard,
handled the giant Cadwalader in a
most surprising manner. Traeger
and Raitt showed up in quite their
old form; Slaker and Hill were
always good for a gain; Hauver
inan, Thompson • and McFadden
played hard ball; and Boren and
Cooper hustled the visitors' ends.
Captain Fisher did some good work
on kicks and end runs, and " I'ie"
Smith played his old, strappy
game. Kulin, Dole, Sefton and
Parker held positions later in the
game and played quite up to Var
sity form. For the visitors " Loco
motive" Smith did the best work,
and Clay, Cutter, Gammon and
Parker played good games. Dave
Brown, Stanford '97, was umpire,
and Prescott of the Olympic Club
was referee, while Paul Tarpev,
'05, and J. R. Rithell were line
men.
The teams lined up as follows:
STANFORD. OLYMPICS.

The game opened with Stan
ford's kick-off by Traeger, Cutter
catching the ball and making a
short run, but by a fumble losing
the pigskin to Boren. Smith made
fifteen yards in two end runs,
Slaker bucked the line for a short
distance, and Fisher made a gain
around right end. Traeger then
tried a place kick for goal from the
twenty-five-yard line, missing by a
few inches. The Olympics' free
kick from the twenty-five-yard line
was made by Cutter, who put the
spheroid to Stanford's fifteen-yard
line, seventy yards away, this being
the longest kick of the day. Fisher
kicked the ball hack, and during
the Mne-up the visitors got five

yards on Stanford's interference
with center; this being due to
Olympics' odd manner of Hipping
the ball back. Cutter bucked twice,
making little, and, as Davis gained
hardly anything on a "tackle
back," the ball went to Stanford on
downs. Fisher was then sent in
for a small gain, kicking twenty
yards shortly afterwards; Raitt got
under the leather and Fisher, fol
lowed with another kick, which
Smedburg caught just before
Traeger dropped him. Stanford
held well for two downs and Cutter
was forced to kick, the spheroid
going out of bounds as time was
called. No score.
At the beginning of the second
half Hill took Fisher's place, Kuhn
that of Cooper, and Sefton left end
for Boren.
Cadwalader kicked to Stanford's
Smith, who ran in for ten yards;
and Hill punted fifty yards to
"Locomotive" Smith, who was
brought down by Sefton. As he
fell he passed the ball to Gammon,
who was tackled immediately by
Traeger. The city team then tried
a fake kick, which lost them
ground. Smith of the visitors then
made three yards on a left-end run
and Cutter kicked again, Raitt
catching the ball but being stopped
by Parker with a small gain. Hill
was given the ball for thirty-five
yards around left end; Smith made
a small gain; Hill followed with
ten yards, behind good interfer
ence; and Slaker bucked three
yards over the goal line. Referee
Prescott declared, however, that
two of Stanford's men played be
fore the ball was passed, anu sent
them hack. Slaker was again sent
over, and it was called out of
bounds. Fickert, at these rank de
cisions, called his men off the field,
but finally they returned, and, for
the third time, Stanford carried
the spheroid across the line, Hill
being sent through tackle. Pres
cott allowed this to be a touch
down, and the crowd on the bleach
ers hooted the referee. It is
entirely possible, however, that
some of Prescott's decisions during
the game were just. Traeger soon
after kicked the goal. Score,
6 to 0.
Hill then caught Cadwalader's
kick-off and ran wifh it fifteen
yards, punting to Gammon, who
was tackled by Traeger. Thompson
brought the hall to Stanford on a
fumble. Mill kicked forty yards
out of bounds. Smith of the Frisco
club went in for three yards, but
Stanford held well, Allen nailing
the famous half on an end run
which gained the visitors only a
yard; Stanford's ball on a fumble.
Hill kicked to Gammon, who was
tackled by Kuhn. Parker took
Slaker's place among the Cardinal
players. Stanford lost ten yards
for off-side play. Parker and Sefton
of the home team tackled Gammon,
who made five yards, and was sent
in for five more. It is Olympics'
turn now, and on off side play
Prescott lops ten yards off the
ground they have gained; hut they
made it up again. Cutter kicked a
short distance, Stanford made a
short run and Hill kicked to Smith,
who was tackled by Sefton and
Traeger as time was called.
