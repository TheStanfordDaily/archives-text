President Hick of the Inter-
Society Debating League has made
a call for the Freshmen to organize
their debating society. For this
purpose a meeting will be held
Wednesday afternoon. Last year
was the first time that the entering

class conducted such a society, and
the results were gratifying. Every
new student interested in speaking
or debating should identify himself
with the organization for the bene
fit he will derive as well as for the
good he may do the University.
