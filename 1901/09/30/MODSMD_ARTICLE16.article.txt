# Nourse Doing Well.
## 
### 
" Baldy'' Nourse is believed to
be improving. He is not yet en
tirely out of danger, however, and
will not be for at least two days.
He rests well today, with no fever,
and spent a very restful night.
His good constitution and steady
habits will serve him well toward a
speedy recovery. Things are kept
verv quiet around the training
house and he does not seem to
suffer from the noise.
