# CHANGES IN CONSTITUTION.
## Four Amendments Proposed, One by Faculty, Three by Executive Committee. 
### 
The following amendments will
be voted upon at the student body
meeting Wednesday:
Add to Article II the following
section:
Section 6. â€” Every ofiicer and
iigent of this Association shall be
elected or appointed .subject to the
condition that if he violates the
rules of the University or does that
which in tlie opinion of the Presi
dent of the University seriously
prejudices University discipline,
his term of office may be ended by
the President of the University.
The powers of such ofiicer or agent
may be terminated by notice or by
mail or otherwise, and within a
reasonable time thereafter he must
deliver 141 to the person named in
such notice all money, books, pa
pers, and property of the Associa
tion in his custody or possession,
and execute to such nominee a
proper transfer of the right to pos
session of any money or other
property on deposit or not in bis
possession to which he is entitled
by virtue of his office or agency.
Every officer or agent of this Asso
ciation and all their acts and con
tracts shall be subject to the fore
going limitations.
Article 11, Section 5, after the
clause, "and shall provide a good
and sufficient bond of five thou
sand dollars ($5,000.00) or a larger
sum, as may be provided by the
Executive Committee," insert: Such
bond shall be filed and approved
by the Executive Committee not
later than three weeks after his
election.
Article V, Section 3. Substitute
the following: Officers shall as
sume their duties at the end of the
semester in which they are elected.
Article 111, Section 4, Add: And
when all members shall have been
given due notice of the meeting.
Article 111, Section 3. Insert
after the clause, " to fill all vacan
cies occurring in offices of the As
sociation," the following: To re
move from office any officer of the
Association on account of gross
misconduct in office, or when they
consider the general interests of
the Association demand it.
The first amendment, proposed
by the Faculty Committee, is the
most important one offered. In
the interest of harmony it is im
perative that it be passed without
delay. If this amendment fails we
will be without a treasurer, as the
election of Mr. Edwards is but a
temporary arrangement, pending
the passage of the proposed amend
ment.
The second amendment provides
a time when the treasurer shall
file his bond. Under the present
constitution no time is specified.
The need of this amendment is ob
vious.
The amendment Article V pro
vides the terms of student body of
ficers to begin at Commencement,
instead of September. This is
necessary in order that the treas
urer and managers of the publica
tions may make such arrange
ments during vacation as can not

be put off until the opening of the
new semester.
The amendment providing that
all members of the Executive Com
mittee shall be notified of every
meeting is a safeguard against
a bare majority holding a special
meeting and transacting business
against the will of those not noti
fied.
The last amendment provides
that the Executive Committee shall
have the power of removal from
office.
