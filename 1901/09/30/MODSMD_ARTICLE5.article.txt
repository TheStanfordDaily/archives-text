# Horan Registers.
## 
### 
H. A. Horan, the big guard from
Lafayette, whose registration has
hung fire on account of trouble
with credentials, has succeeded in
getting enrolled today. His ap
pearance in the Held will greatly
strengthen the Varsity line. Ho
ran has had several years' experi
ence, and weighs 205 pounds. His
playing will allow big McKadden
to try for center instead of guard,
for which position he is least' best
adapted.
