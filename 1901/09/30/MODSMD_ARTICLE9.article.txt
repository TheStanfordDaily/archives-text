Fhkshmkn, new or perennial,
were responsible for the jeering of
officials at the football game Satur
day. Whatever may have been
their opinion of some decisions,
they must learn that this sort of
thing not only disgraces the Uni
versity, but it violates the spirit in
which our teams compete as
amateur sportsmen. Hooting may
be excusable in a preparatory
school; at a University we are sup
posed to be men and women. A
demand for fair play may at times
be in place, but this should not be
made through the medium of
rowdyism.
Saturday the Olympic team were
our guests on this campus. We are
indebted to them for giving us the
benefit of the practice. Nothing
was at stake in the contest. If the
umpire erred in giving close decis
ions, it was not the function of the
bleachers to pass judgment during
the game. The Daily Palo Alto
offers to the Olympic Club an
apology for the discourtesy shown
them.
