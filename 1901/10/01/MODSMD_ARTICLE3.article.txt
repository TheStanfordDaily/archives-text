# President Jordan's Address.
## 
### 
Ten years ago today the students
and faculty of Leland Stanford Jr.
University met to inaugurate a new
center of higher education in Cali
fornia. There was money and hope,
flowers and sunshine, the glories of
nature and the glories of architec
ture. The one question was, Shall
we have students? The popula
tion of the Coast was scanty, less
all told than that of the city of Chi
cago. Lt had already an honored
university and no visible place for
more.
The New York Mail and Express
notified us that there was as much
room fora new university in Cal
ifornia as for an asylum for broken
down sea-captains in Switzerland,
and the professors were told that
for years they must "lecture in
marble halls to empty benches," if,
indeed, there should be any need of
benches in these halls, in which
they would serve only to disfigure
the architecture. The first entrance
examination offered little more en
couragement. It was held on the
porch of Escondite cottage. Three

candidates were present: two men
who failed, and one woman, Miss
Longley of Mountain View, who
passed — the first student admitted
to Stanford.
Lest we should provide a feast
for those who would not come, it
was agreed to limit the faculty at
the beginning to fifteen besides the
President, the Registrar, who also
taught economics, the librarian,
Professor Woodruff, who could also
teach law, and Bert Fesler, who
taught the higher law in Encitia
Hall. After these there was a
waiting list of assistants who could
come if wanted, besides two heads
of departments, Professor Stillman
and Professor Warner, who were to
arrive at Christmas. Then Presi
dent White of Cornell, in more
ways than one the good friend, the
good angel of the institution, one
who has never lost faith in its pres
ent or its future, for he saw in its
growth his own best educational
ideas made actual, — President
White agreed to come as lecturer
on the French Revolution.
The fifteen professors at the be
ginning were these : Branner, How
ard, Jenkins, Anderson, Sanford,
Marx, Pease, Gilbert, Swain, Camp
bell, Richardson, Griffin, Barnes,
Todd, Gale.
On the waiting list ready to be
called by telegram, and all of them
needed within a week, were Profes
sors Wood, Brown, Newcomer,
Howard, Miller, .John Miller, Laird,
and Griggs. Among the graduate
students were Thoburn, Price, Mc-
Farland, Cox, and C. W. Greene,
soon called to the faculty; and
among the undergraduates, Stearns,
Newsom, Whittier, Copeland, Far
mer, Snyder, Elmore, and perhaps
others who have since found an
honorable place upon the teaching
force.
Four hundred and sixty-five stu
dents were in attendance on this
first day of October, 1891. They
came from almost every state in
the Union, from Europe, China,
and Japan. About a hundred re
ceived advanced standing. The
rest formed the famous pioneer
class, the class of 1895, the class
which already reminds us that
there were giants in those days
when the world and the Uni
versity were young. And with
the presence of the students we
found our just reason for being.
The work began in serious, hopeful
earnestness. It is going on today,
and it will go on, we believe, so
long as civilization shall endure.
Oxford, founded by Alfred the
Great, has a thousand years the
start, but this does not discourage
us, for we have kept up with it.
The new University jides on the
shoulders of the old, and the les
sons of the thousand years belong
to us just as much as to old Ox
ford.
One lesson of these ten years is
ours and ours alone. It is the les

son of faith and fidelity — faith in
the future under God's help, and
fidelity to a trust under the most
discouraging conditions.
There is not one of us who real
izes the tremendous nature of the
obstacles encountered by the Uni
versity in the years from 1893 to
1896, the years of financial panic,
of wanton litigation, the times of
depression and distress which de
scended like a prison gate on an
institution prepared only for hope
and progress. There was but one
thing which could save the institu
tion, the unswerving devotion of
the surviving founder. To doubt
or falter was to perish, and in the
most trying times no such words
were found in her vocabulary. To
her there must always be a way.
The good Lord would provide it.
And always the way was found,
and the University dedicated to her
beloved son has never closed its
doors once opened. By the noble
generosity of the founders, and the
help of Him who doetli all things
well, these doors shall never be
closed so long as one stone shall re
main upon another.
