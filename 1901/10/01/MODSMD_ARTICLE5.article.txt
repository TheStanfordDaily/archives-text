# Senator Stanford's Address.
## 
### 
I desire to state that iii the few
remarks 1 am about to make 1
speak for Mrs. Stanford, as well
as for myself, for she has been my
active and sympathetic coadjutor
and is co-grantor with nie in the
endowment and establishment of
this University. In its behalf her
prayers have gone forth that it may
be a-benefactor to humanity and
receive the blessing of the Heavenly
Father.
On the 14th day of May, 1887,
the cornerstone of this quadrangle
was laid, and on the first day of
October, 1891, we meet to formally
throw open the doors of the insti
tution. Of those present at the
laying of the cornerstone many are
here today, but some of them are
with us only in spirit and in mem
ory.
For Mrs. Stanford and myself
this ceremony marks an epoch in
our lives, for we see in part the
realization of the hopes and efforts
of years; for you, faculty and stu
dents, the work begins now, and it
is to commemorate this commence
ment of your labors that we are
here assembled.
That which we have bestowed
upon the establishment and endow
ment of this institution we have
been more than advised once to
turn into other channels. It has
several times been suggested to us
that there was a limit to the be
neficence of education —that that
limit had been reached in this
country, and that the public, priv
ate, and endowed schools and col
leges already more than supplied
all the needs of the community —
but we have thought differently.
We do not believe there can
be superfluous education. As man
cannot have too much health and
intelligence, so he cannot be too
highly educated. Whether in the
discharge of responsible or humble
duties, he will ever find the knowl
edge he has acquired through educa
tion not only of practical assistance

to him, but a factor in his personal
happiness and a joy forever.
It is through education that the
possible future of man is to be as
certained mid attained. The Cre
ator has not given man rational
wants without the means of sup
plying them. He has given us an
all-bountiful earth that yields inex
haustible supplies for our use.
Men have only to apply their la
bor intelligently and learn to
control the natural forces that
surround them to have at their
command all the comforts and ele
gancies of life. Man's true happi
ness is to be attained not merely
by satisfying his physical wants,
but in the development of bis in
tellectual, moral, and religious na
ture. It is through the expansion
and development of these that the
high standard which the Creator
has made possible is to be reached,
and when this standard is attained,
the result will be the establishment
and general practice of the Golden
Rule and the realization of the
greatest happiness. 1 hope, there
fore, that you will ever keep before
you the highest possible standard,
that you will strive to attain it, and
fully realize that its attainment
is the object of education.
The high condition of civiliza
tion to which man may attain in
the future it is almost impossible
for us to now appreciate. We can
best obtain an idea of it by a com
parison of our present condition
with that of preceding generations.
Nor have we to look very far back.
A few years ago, within the mem
ory of a majority of the adults here
present —in these United States,
whose very existence as a nation
was justified by an inspired declar
ation of human inalienable rights
—over four millions of human be
ings were held in slavery by mere
might. A majority of the people
of our country were at that time
fully persuaded that the right to
ownership of human beings existed
by a law which it was bound to
sustain by force if necessary.
We believe that a wise system of
education will develop a future
civilization as much in advance of
that of the present as ours is in
advance of the condition of the
savage. We may always advance
toward the infinite.
The wonderful improvements in
inventions and machinery within
the last fifty years, by multiplying
the power of production, have as
sisted greatly in the advancement
of civilization. But for the inven
tion that had done the most for
education we must look back 450
years, to the gigantic and ever in
creasing force put in motion by
Gutenburg—the printing press. It
has made all later inventions pos
sible and practical. It has done
more for the dissemination of edu
cation than the endowments of
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, or Gi
rard, and but for its existence I do
not think I should have had occa
sion to address you today.
Once the great struggle of labor
was to supply the necessities of life;
now but a small portion of our peo
ple are so engaged. Food, clothing
and shelter are common in our
country to every provident person,
excepting, of course, in occasional
