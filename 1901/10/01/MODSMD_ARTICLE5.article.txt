# Senator Stanford's Address.
## 
### 
I desire to state that iii the few
remarks 1 am about to make 1
speak for Mrs. Stanford, as well
as for myself, for she has been my
active and sympathetic coadjutor
and is co-grantor with nie in the
endowment and establishment of
this University. In its behalf her
prayers have gone forth that it may
be a-benefactor to humanity and
receive the blessing of the Heavenly
Father.
On the 14th day of May, 1887,
the cornerstone of this quadrangle
was laid, and on the first day of
October, 1891, we meet to formally
throw open the doors of the insti
tution. Of those present at the
laying of the cornerstone many are
here today, but some of them are
with us only in spirit and in mem
ory.
For Mrs. Stanford and myself
this ceremony marks an epoch in
our lives, for we see in part the
realization of the hopes and efforts
of years; for you, faculty and stu
dents, the work begins now, and it
is to commemorate this commence
ment of your labors that we are
here assembled.
That which we have bestowed
upon the establishment and endow
ment of this institution we have
been more than advised once to
turn into other channels. It has
several times been suggested to us
that there was a limit to the be
neficence of education —that that
limit had been reached in this
country, and that the public, priv
ate, and endowed schools and col
leges already more than supplied
all the needs of the community —
but we have thought differently.
We do not believe there can
be superfluous education. As man
cannot have too much health and
intelligence, so he cannot be too
highly educated. Whether in the
discharge of responsible or humble
duties, he will ever find the knowl
edge he has acquired through educa
tion not only of practical assistance

to him, but a factor in his personal
happiness and a joy forever.
It is through education that the
possible future of man is to be as
certained mid attained. The Cre
ator has not given man rational
wants without the means of sup
plying them. He has given us an
all-bountiful earth that yields inex
haustible supplies for our use.
Men have only to apply their la
bor intelligently and learn to
control the natural forces that
surround them to have at their
command all the comforts and ele
gancies of life. Man's true happi
ness is to be attained not merely
by satisfying his physical wants,
but in the development of bis in
tellectual, moral, and religious na
ture. It is through the expansion
and development of these that the
high standard which the Creator
has made possible is to be reached,
and when this standard is attained,
the result will be the establishment
and general practice of the Golden
Rule and the realization of the
greatest happiness. 1 hope, there
fore, that you will ever keep before
you the highest possible standard,
that you will strive to attain it, and
fully realize that its attainment
is the object of education.
The high condition of civiliza
tion to which man may attain in
the future it is almost impossible
for us to now appreciate. We can
best obtain an idea of it by a com
parison of our present condition
with that of preceding generations.
Nor have we to look very far back.
A few years ago, within the mem
ory of a majority of the adults here
present —in these United States,
whose very existence as a nation
was justified by an inspired declar
ation of human inalienable rights
—over four millions of human be
ings were held in slavery by mere
might. A majority of the people
of our country were at that time
fully persuaded that the right to
ownership of human beings existed
by a law which it was bound to
sustain by force if necessary.
We believe that a wise system of
education will develop a future
civilization as much in advance of
that of the present as ours is in
advance of the condition of the
savage. We may always advance
toward the infinite.
The wonderful improvements in
inventions and machinery within
the last fifty years, by multiplying
the power of production, have as
sisted greatly in the advancement
of civilization. But for the inven
tion that had done the most for
education we must look back 450
years, to the gigantic and ever in
creasing force put in motion by
Gutenburg—the printing press. It
has made all later inventions pos
sible and practical. It has done
more for the dissemination of edu
cation than the endowments of
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, or Gi
rard, and but for its existence I do
not think I should have had occa
sion to address you today.
Once the great struggle of labor
was to supply the necessities of life;
now but a small portion of our peo
ple are so engaged. Food, clothing
and shelter are common in our
country to every provident person,
excepting, of course, in occasional
accidental cases. The great de- j
maud for labor is to supply what
may be termed intellectual wants,
t-o which there is no limit, except
that of intelligence to conceive. If
all the relations and obligations of
man were properly understood it
would not be necessary for people
to make a burden of labor. The
great masses of the toilers now are
compelled to perform such an
amount of labor as makes life often
wearisome. An intelligent system
of education would correct this in
equality. It would make the hum
blest laborer's work more valuable,
it would increase both the demand
and supply for skilled labor and
reduce the number of the non-pro
ducing class. Jt would dignify
labor, and ultimately would go far
to wipe out the mere distinctions
of wealth and ancestry. It would
achieve a bloodless revolution and
establish a Republic of industry,
merit, and learning.
Mow near to that state we may
be, or how far from it, we cannot
now tell. It Beems very far when
we contemplate the great standing
armies of Europe, where over five
millions of men (or about owe to
every twelve adult males) are
marching about with guns on their
shoulders to preserve the peace of
the nations, while hovering near
them is an innumerable force of po
lice to preserve the peace of indi
viduals; but when we remember
tlie possibilities of civilization and
the power of education we can fore
see a time when these soldiers and
policemen shall be chawged to use
ful, producing citizens, engaged in
lifting the burdens of the people
instead of increasing them. And
yet extravagant as are the nations
of Europe in standing armies and
preparations for war, their extrava
gance in the waste of labor is still
greater. Education, by teaching
the intelligent use of machinery, is
the only remedy for such waste.
We have provided in the articles of
endowment that the education of
the sexes shall be equal —deeming
it of special importance that those
who are to be the mothers of a fu
ture generation shall be fitted to
mold and direct the infantile mind
at its most critical period. A cele
brated philosopher has said that
the education received by a child
in the first five years of its life was
more important than all the rest;
another states that in its first seven
years the child receives more ideas
than in all its after life. How im
portant, therefore, is it to have
mothers capable of rightly directing
the young intelligence.
We have also provided that the
benefits resulting from co-operation
shall be freely taught. It is through
co-operation that modern progress
has been mostly achieved. Co-op
erative societies bring forth the best
capacities, the best influences of tfie
individual for the benefit of the
whole, while the good influences of
the many aid the individual.
The intelligent development of
the human faculties is necessary to
man's happiness, and if this be
true, each individual should, if pos
sible, have such a liberal education
as to enable him to understand, ap
preciate, and enjoy the knowledge
of others. We trust that the edu
cation in this institution will be of
such a liberal and broad character
that all connected with it will have
none but the best of feelings toward
other educational institutions and
particularly toward those of this
State. We are all working to the

same end. Let us, therefore, cor
dially co-operate. The immediate
object of this institution is the per
sonal benefit and advancement of
the students, but we look beyond to
the influence it will exert on the
general welfare of humanity.
Gentlemen of the Board of True
tees, the management of the affairs
of the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity will ultimately devolve up
on you. Upon you, therefore, will
largely depend its future usefulness
and success. We feel assured that
you realize this as we do, and that
you will exercise the same vigilance
in the discharge of your duties as
trustees that you have shown in
the management of your own per
sonal business. We have decided
to start this institution with the
college course of study beginning
with the freshman year. In time
we hope to extend its scope from
the kindergarten through the high
school to the university course, and
afford opportunities for improve
ment and investigation to post
graduates and specialists.
When that day comes to us that
sooner or later must come to all, we
think we shall both approach the
great change the more calmly from
the knowledge that the threads of
our work will be taken up by you
and followed along the line we
have traced.
Mr. President and faculty, upon
you largely dspends the success of
this as an educational institution.
Ample endowment may have been
provided, intelligent management
may secure large income, students
may present themselves in num
bers, hut in the end, the faculty
makes or mars the University.
The born student is an exception.
We know of calculating boys with
wonderful mathematical gifts, of a
musician who when eight years old
composed " Sonatas," of a poet who
" lisped in numbers," but the aver
age l*)y and girl of today depend
almost entirely on their instructor
for their energetic interest and as
sured success in study. The stu
dents who go out into the world
from these halls will be the guage
by which our efforts in behalf of
education will be tested.
The task before you is a great
one and your responsibilities :ire
proportionate. Your examples
will have even more influence on
the future of these students than
your teachings. The old Latin
saying is true that c< by precept the
road to learning is long, but short
and sure by example." 1 shall
not presume to enlarge upon this
subject. Your past records as
educators is a sufficient guarantee
for you work here, but we desire to
remind yon that it is our hope that
the young women and the young
men who graduate from Palo Alto
shall not only be scholars, but
shall have a sound practical idea
of common-place every-day mat
ters, a self-reliance that will fit
them, in case of emergency, to earn
their own livelihood in an humble
as well as an exalted sphere.
Added to this, we wish them to go
out into the world with a lofty
sense of man's and woman's re
sponsibilities on earth in accord
ance with the highest teachings of
morality and religion. May you
rise to a full appreciation of the
important trust placed in your
control.
Students of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, upon the indi
vidual efforts of each of you mainly
depends his or her future success

in life. A University may be
founded for you; in it you may
study for years, under able profes
sors, and with all the advantages
of the learning, science, and in
genuity of these days; you may be
gifted with many talents ; and yet
your labor will be comparatively
fruitless and in after life you may
be failures, or you may go from
here fully equipped to make your
way through life with happiness to
yourself and benefit to humanity.
All that we can do for you is to
place the opportunities within your
reach; it rests with you to grasp
and improve them. Remember
that life is, above all, practical;
that you are here to tit yourselves for
a useful career; also, that learning
should not only make you wise in
the arts and sciences, but should
fully develop your moral and re
ligious natures. The humanizing
influences come from a proper un
derstanding of the rights of man
and bis duties to his Creator. With
a full appreciation of these he will
comprehend and have developed
in him the active principles of re
ligion, to wit: Benevolence, tolera
tion, kindness, patience, forbear
ance, and a helpful regard for the
general interests of his fellow crea
tures, with a charity that will reach
every condition of life.
You, students, are the most im
portant factor in this University.
It is for your benefit that it has
been established. We hope and
believe that you will fully realize
and live up to this fact. To you
our hearts go out especially, and in
each individual student we feel a
parental interest. We want you all
to be, not only a credit to the Uni
versity, but also a eredijt to your
selves. How to succeed in this it is
for you, with the precepts and ex
amples of your professors, to dis
cover; and as a foundation for the
whole superstructure we would sug
gest to each young man and young
woman to bear in mind the ad
monition of the wise king, " Re
member now thy Creator in the
days of thy youth."
