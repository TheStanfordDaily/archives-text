Rev. Robert Mackenzie spoke in
place of Trustee Leib, wlio was un
avoidably detained in the East.
The topic of his address was " Pro
vincialism."
William J. Neidig read the follow
ing poem, written by him especi
ally for this decennial.
After Ten Years.
There is a loveliness more fair
As it hath softened to the air
Of many summers; dear and high,
More exquisitely dear, as eye
Hath measured it against the blue
Of skies loiifj faded to the view,
As heart hath held it safely fast
Through praise, and blame, and perils
past,
And thoughts uuconstant. Age doth
trace
Such beauty with abiding grace.
O first arcade, red roof, and spread
Of consecrated court we tread !
Fair is the thought and fair the stone
The years have left their seal upon;
Fair were they ever: they arose
In symmetry and brown repose;
In beauty they were set apart ;
Today they lie at beauty's heart.
Oh, it was no mirage that lay
Against the hills that autumn day:
Brown sandstone springing from the
field:
Red roofs 011 azure sky revealed;
No dream that eager doors swung wide
Inviting who had faith inside;
No vision that each bench and chair
Seated some daring spirit there.
Ten years! Yes, sandstone fair hath
been;
Sandstone as brown shall be again;
Yet it is something to have pressed
Through halls of honor, then a guest

While honor was a name, and hope
Flew from high halyards, and the slope
Of hard emprise was etill unwrought.
Aye, something to have held thin
thought
When beauty wore a newer face,
And love was younger in the place.
Ten years is not a lifetime, no;
But we who walk beneath the how
Of promise, the first arch of faith,
Have somewhat measured beauty's path
Since then, and wonder seizes home
At what her measure hath become.
New walls, new pavements too are dear;
New arches rising year by year,
These outer ranks of stone and tile,
Are fair as any were the while.
Ah, fair as any! and they hold
Light hearts and echoes manifold.
Fair, fair as any! fair to please!
But oh, they are not dear as these
First colonnades and walls of stone
With climbing ivy overgrown:
This court of honor, bound in one
With other beauties late begun!
Ten years! 0 ready tongue to praise!
O eyes, upon whose crystal gaze
The years have gathered like hoar-frost!
O youth of things forever lost!
Ten years! Yes, that was ages past:
And'so today will be at last,
Andjthis new glory, spreading round
Tolsome be consecrated ground
At.laat, because with it they grew
when the world was new.
