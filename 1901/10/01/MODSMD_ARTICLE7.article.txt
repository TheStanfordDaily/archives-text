# Dr. Jordan's Former Address.

### 
We come together today for the
first time as teachers and
students. With this relation the
the life of the Leland Stanford
Junior University begins, it is
such personal contact of young
men and young women with schol
ars and investigators which consti
tutes the life of the University, it
is for us as teachers and students
in the University's first year to lay
the foundations of a school which
may last as long as human civiliza
tion. Ours is the youngest of the
universities, but it is heir to the
wisdom of all the ages, and with
this inheritance it has the promise
of a rapid and sturdy growth.
Our University has no history to
fall back upon; no memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors;
in none of its rooms appear the
traces which show where a great
man has ever lived or worked. No
tender associations cling, ivy-like,
to its fresh new walls. It is hal
lowed by no traditions; it is ham
pered by none. Its finger-posts
still point forward. Traditions and
associations it is ours to make.
From our work the future of the
University will grow as a splendid
lily from a modest bulb.
But the future with its glories and
its responsibilities will be in other
hands, it is ours at the beginning
to give the University its form, its
tendencies, its customs. The power
of precedent will cause to be re
peated over and over again every
thing that we do â€”our errors as
well as our wisdom. It becomes us
then to begin the work modestly,
as under the eye of the coming
ages. We must lay the founda
tions broad and firm, so as to give
full support to whatever edifice the
future may build. Ours is the hum
bler task, but not the least in im
portance, and our work will not be
in vain if all that we do is done
with sincerity. As sound as the
rocks from which these walls are
hewn should be the work of every
teacher who comes within them.
To the extent that this is true will
the University be successful. Un
less its work be thus " wrought in a
sad sincerity," nothing can redeem
it from failure. In this feeling,
and realizing, too, that only the
help we give to the men and women
whose lives we reach can justify
our presence here, we are ready to
begin our work.
We hope to give to our students
the priceless legacy of the educated
man, the power of knowing what
really is. The higher education
should bring men into direct con
tact with truth. It should help to
free them from the dead hands of
old traditions and to enable them
to form opinions worthy of the new
evidence each new day brings be
fore them. An educated man
should not be the slave of the past,
not a copy of men who have gone
before him. He must be in some
degree the founder of a new intel
lectual dynasty, for each new
thinker is a new type of man.
Whatever is true is the truest thing
in the universe, and mental and
moral strength cotne alike from our
contact with it.
Every influence which goes out
from these halls should emphasize
the value of truth. The essence of
scholarship is to know something
which is absolutely true; to have,
in the words of Huxle}', "some
knowledge to the certainty of which
no authority could add or take
away, and to which the tradition of

a thousand years is but as the
hearsay of yesterday." The scholar,
as was once said of our great chem
ist, Benjamin Silliman, must have
"faith in truth as truth, faith that
there is a power in the universe
good enough to make truth-telling
safe, and strong enough to make
truth-telling effective." The per
sonal influence of genuineness, as
embodied in the life of a teacher, is
one of the strongest moral forces
which the school can bring to its
aid, for moral training comes not
mainly by precept but by practice.
We may teach the value of truth to
our students by showing that we
value it ourselves.
In like manner the value of right
living can be taught by right ex
amples. In the words of a wise
teacher (Professor William J. Bry
an), "Science knows no source of
life but life. The teacher is one of
the accredited delegates of civiliza
tion. In Heine's phrase, he is a
Knight of the Holy Ghost. If
virtue and integrity are to be prop
agated, they must be propagated by
people who possess them. If this
child-world about us that we know
and love is to grow up into right
eous manhood and womanhood, it
must have a chance to see how
righteousness looks when it is lived.
That this may be so, what task
have we but to garrison our state
with men and women? If we can
do that, if we can have in every
square mile in our country a man
or woman whose total inliuence
is a civilizing power, we shall get
from our educational system all it
can give and all that we can de
sire." So we may hope that this
new school will do its part in the
work of civilization, side by side
with her elder sister, the University
of the State, and in perfect har
mony with every agency which
makes for right thinking and right
living. The harvest is bounteous,
but tools and workmen are still all
too few; fora generous education
should be the birthright of every
man and woman in America.
I shall not try today to give you
our ideal of what a university
should be. If our work is success
ful, our ideals will appear in the
daily life of the school. In a
school, as in a fortress, it is not the
form of the building but thestrength
of the materials which determines
its effectiveness. With a garrison
of hearts of oak, it may not matter
even whether there be a fortress.
Whatever its form, or its organiza
tion, or its pretensions, the charac
ter of the university is fixed by the
men who teach. " Have a univer
sity in shanties, nay in tents," Car
dinal Newman has said, "but have
great teachers in it." The univer
sity spirit flows out from these
teachers, and its organization serves
mainly to bring them together.
"The university," to use Emerson's
words, "should bring every ray of
light to its hospitable halls, that
their combined influence may set
the heart of youth in flame."
Strong men make universities
strong. A great man never fails to
leave a great mark 011 every youth
with whom he conies in contact.
Too much emphasis cannot be laid
on this, that the real purpose of the
university organization is to pro
duce a university atmosphere, such
an atmosphere as gathered itself
around Arnold at Rugby, around
Dollinger at Munich, around Lin
najus at Upsala, around Werner at
Freiberg, around Agassiz at Cam
bridge, around Mark Hopkins at

Williamstown, around Andrew D.
White at Ithaca, around all great
teachers everywhere.
A professor to whom original in
vestigation is unknown should have
no place in a university. Men of
commonplace or second-band schol
arship are of necessity men of low
ideals, however much the fact may
be disguised. A man of high ideals
must be an investigator. He must
know and think for himself. Only
such as do this can be really great
as teachers. Some day our univer
sities will recognize that their most
important professors may be men
who teach no classes, devoting
their time and strength wholly to
advanced research. Their presence
and example will be, perhaps,
worth more to the student body a
hundred-fold than the precepts and
drill of the others. They set high
standards of thought. They help
to create the university spirit,
without which any college is but a
grammar school of little higher
pretensions.
And above and beyond all learn
ing is the influence of character,
the impulse to virtue and piety
which comes from men whose lives
show that virtue and piety really
exist. For the life of the most ex
alted, as well as the humblest of
men, there can be no nobler motto
than that inscribed by the great
scholar of the last century over his
home at Ilammarby: "Innocue vi
vito; numen <idest." Live blame
less; God is near. "This,'' said
Linnseus, "is the wisdom of my
life." Every advance which we
make toward the realization of the
truth of the permanence and im
manence of law, brings us nearer
to Him who is the first great cause
of all law and all phenomena.
But while the work of the teach
ers must make the kernel of the
university, we must rejoice that
here at Palo Alto even the husks
are beautiful. Beauty and fitness
are great forces in education. Ev
ery object with which the young
mind comes in contaci leaves on
it its trace. "Nothing is unimport
ant in the life of man," and the
least feature of our surroundings
has its influence, greater or less.
"There was a child went forth ev
ery day," Walt Whitman tells us,
"and the first object that it looked
upon, that object it became." It
may be fora moment or an hour,
or "for changing cycles of years."
The essence of civilization is expos
ure to refining and humanizing in
fluences. "A dollar in a univer
sity," Emerson tells us, "is worth
more than a dollar in a jail," and
every dollar spent in making a
university beautiful will be repaid
with interest in the enriching of the
students' lives.
It has been a reproach of Amer
ica that for the best of her sons and
daughters she has done the least.
She has built palaces for lunatics,
idiots, crippled, and blind, nay,
even for criminals and paupers.
But the college students, "the
young men of sound mind and
earnest purpose, the noblest treas
ures of the State," to quote the
words of President White, " she
has housed in vile barracks." The
student has 110 need for luxury.
Plain living has ever gone with
high thinking. But grace and fit
ness have an educative power too
often forgotten in this utilitarian
age. These long corridors with
their stately pillars, these circles of
waving palms, will have their part
in the students' training as surely
