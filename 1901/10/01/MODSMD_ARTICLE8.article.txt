Professor M. B. Anderson's speech
upon " President Jordan's Address
and the University Ideal," given
tonight, was, in part, as follows:
Professor Anderson's Address.
The burden of President Jordan's
address lies, it seems to me, in the
stress he lays upon the importance
of a right atmosphere about the
University : pure, clear air, full
charged with spiritual ozone. Of
such an atmosphere the main ele
ments, he tells us, are Truth, Char
acter, Beauty. This is the holy
trinity of university influences,
quickening to the soul as moun
tain air to the body. These stim
ulating influences defy analysis.
With what instruments of precision
are we to weigh human character?
Who has made answer to the ques
tion of the incredulous Pilate,
" What is truth " ? Does not Beauty,
like the rainbow, forever elude the
pursuer ? Yet these words stand
for primal realities. They mean
something even to the thoughtless
or flippant; and more and more to
us, as climbing the mountain of
spiritual endeavor, our vision wid
ens. At moments like this, when
we stop to look back upon the way
we have come, and to gaze forward
and up to the solemn heights, it is
well to try to freshen our sense of
the meaning of these mysterious
quickening influences : Truth, Cha
racter, Beauty.
To consider them all is beyond
the scope of the few words I may
permit myself. I will merely in
vite your attention to some consid
erations which appear to grow nat
urally out of President Jordan's
beautiful and suggestive words con
cerning the central importance of
the power and influence of Truth.
The power of Truth is emphasized
as the primary element, the oxy
gen, of the university atmosphere.
I hope it may be assumed that a
student of belles-lettres has no
reason to fear the suspicion of un
dervaluing the power and influence
of Beauty. It wp.s the poet Keats,
the worshipper of Beauty, who
wrought his ode, the exquisite Gre
cian Urn, into a vase for that
flower of thought, " Beauty is truth,
truth beauty." Tohim was unveiled
the vision of ideal Beauty ; perhaps
we may concede that he had some
glimpse of Truth, also. He was
possessed, as all poets and many
philosophers have been, with a
sense of the essential harmony of
the two powers : he saw the figure of
Truth wearing Beauty as a gar
ment.
As to the power of Character, he
would be a-false teacher who could
speak of it as essentially secondary..
A character, — free, pure, noble, —
is beyond rubies, beyond even
learning. In theschool of the world,
Character occupies the supreme

place. It stands to Beauty and
Truth in the same relative position
as that assigned by St. Paul to Love
among the Christian graces. When
we enter a university we do not
leave the school of the world ; in
the university, as everywhere else,
" conduct is three-fourths of life."
And the university is, indeed, an
excellent school of character,
though in this respect it does not
enjoy pre-eminence over other de
partments of the school of life. The
home, the street, the church, the
forum, the sick-room, — wherever
men meet to be tested and tempted
there is a school of conduct, a
course in character.
Eh bildet ein Talent sicli in der Stille,
Sicli ein Karakterin dem Strom der Welt,
says Goethe. A talent shapes itself
in solitude, but Character in the
very tide of life. If, then, the uni
versity recognizes, in its field and
for its purposes, the paramount
value of Truth, there is involved no
disparagement of the claims of
Character. As well might we sus
pect Keats of undervaluing Beauty
in giving the supreme place, in the
"Ode to a Grecian Urn," to the
statement of an abstract truth, es
sentially impractical. Jt is by
their loyalty to truth, that the stu
dent, the investigator, exemplify
the power of character. Scholar
ship involves the severest disci
pline of the Character. Certainly
no one can be a great teacher with
out having high character, as well
as culture of intellect. At the uni
versity plastic spirits are some
times cast in the mould of a great
teacher. Hut the process is liable
to accident, to interruption. The
cast may suffer disfigurement be
fore it hardens. Or, possibly, there
may not be metal enough to till the
mould. The point to be made clear
is, that for this high and difficult
and all-important discipline which
we call the cultivation of Character
the university may claim no unas
sailable pre eminence.
One would perhaps not be wide
of the mark in roughly defining a
university as a gathering of
scholars and learners engaged in
the disinterested pursuit of Truth.
Brief and general as it is, this
definition contains elements the
examination of which would lead
far beyond our present scope. It
would be instructive, for example,
to dwell with Leasing and Milton
upon the principle that our spirit
ual safety lies, not at all in the
fancied possession of the Truth, but
altogether in the unceasing search
for it. At the present moment,
however, it seems even more im
portant to consider that element of
the definition suggested by the
word disinterested. Some reaction
ary bodies still hold, with their
eloquent spokesman, Cardinal New
man, to the mediaeval conception
of the university, according to
which it is, for the intellectual
realm, a kind of Holy Roman Em
pire, striving, apparently with
small success, to co-ordinate the
jarring provinces of law, of medi
cine, of philosophy, and "alas, also
theology." The university, so con
ceived, had been found wanting by
Bacon and by Milton, long before
Goethe justly and decisively satir
ized it in his "Faust." it is in
structive to contrast this outworn
type, which is still extant in some
quarters, with the modern ideal,
sketched by that sagacious thinker,
I rofessor Huxley. The university,
according to Huxley, "is not pri
marily an institution for testing
the work of schoolmasters, or for
ascertaining the fitness of young
men to be curates, lawyers, or doc
tors." Positively it is a place where
"a man who claims to devote him
self to science or art should be able
to find some one who can teach
him what is already known, and
train him in the methods of know
ing more." " The professors have to
be at the top of the wave of prog
ress. Research and criticism must
be the breath of their nostrils."
Those who have had the shaping
of this University have had in
view the ultimate realization of the
modern ideal. No doubt most of
the professors lament their inability
to realize it at once. Much pioneer
work has to be undertaken; work
of collegiate rather than university
grade has to be done; the public
has to be educated to a more lib
eral conception of the scholar's
function. Courses of study must
be given which are in the nature
of expedients: scaffoldings conveni
ent in the building process.
Meanwhile there is for the stu
dent an ever-present danger against
which he requires to be fortified.
The student who comes here, osten
sibly at least, for liberal culture, is
pursued to our doors and within
them, by the commercial spirit,
tempting him to gauge the things
of the mind by material standards.
I have not here in view the tech
nical student, who is engaged in a
worthy effort to fit himself to earn
a living. Such a person is not
properly a university student. He
often regards himself as unfor
tunate that he has not the means
to give himself a liberal course of
training. The danger is lest some
of those who have the means and
the aptitude be retarded by a nar
row outlook and a mean aim. To
such one can do no better service
than to hold up the university
ideal of intellectual disinterested
ness. The voice of the world and
perhaps the uncertainty or his per
sonal future, make him timid.
Finding himself free to elect, in
stead of taking counsel of his
nobler instincts, he listens to the
voice of the world, to the hard, sel
fish commercial spirit, which ad
vises him to reject such courses as
are not "practical." Accordingly,
he goes about anxiously inquiring
how this course or that course will
forward him in the race for wealth
or office. He soon comes to. look
upon education as a process of
training his nerve and whetting
his teeth to snatch the bone from
the under dog.
It is no exaggeration to say that
a man's education is worth much
or little to him in proportion to the
largeness of his aim. An education
undertaken with a low aim may
lead to accomplishments ; high
aims lead to culture. The larger
aim involves the love of truth for
itself; and this tends to that self
subordination essential to him who
would bring party, creed, theory,
to the test of reason. Such a man
is the scholar. The conditions to
which a scholar is called upon to
submit seem severe. The univer
sity ideal speaks to him in the
voice of the Master: "Sell all that
thou hast, and come, follow me!"
The man whose face falls at this,
and who turns away because he
has, or hopes for, great possessions,
is not worthy to be a follower of
Truth. Obedience to the voice of
the ideal is the touchstone of the
scholar.
Sometimes, indeed, the sacrifice

is more apparent than real. Solo
mon chose wisdom ; whereupon
riches, and wealth, and honor were
added thereto. Modern instances
were cited; they will occur to
everyone. If the riches turn outto be
only of a spiritual nature, they are
none the less precious. A nd no learn
er, young or old, can foresee what
study or pursuit may enlarge his
capacity for usefulness, and so lead
to honorable recognition. Goethe,
the largest and wisest man of mod
ern times, finds deep significance
in the example of Saul," who went
out in search of his father's asses,
and found a kingdom." The in
stance is typical of the humble
discipline by which men are every
day being shaped t<» ends unfore
seen. Not the thing done, but the
spirit in which it is done, avails.
Had Saul sought his father's asses
with no thought beyond, he would
have deserved to remain an ass
driver. The application of this
principle to the problems of the
student is as obvious in theory as
it may be difficult in practice. If
the lessons of biography can be
trusted, it would appear that a
choice made with a narrow aim
and followed in a selfish spirit
seldom leads to spiritual enlarge
ment.
"Among the objects of human
enterprise," said Cardinal Newman
a half-century ago, " none higher
or nobler can be named than that
which is contemplated in the erec
tion of a university." Today, when
we see, more distinctly than could
have been seen then, the inevitable
process of change from the old
order to the new, we may believe
the university, ideally conceived,
to be the most permanent of human
institutions. " What is excellent,
as God lives, is permanent." As
other parts of the social fabric are
pulled down by revolution, or left
to moulder unregarded in pictures
que ruin, the university will stand,
rock-built upon Truth. Above the
breakers of clashing interests and
(he swirl of selfish passions, the
University Ideal is a far-shining
beacon that may one day save civ
ilization itself from shipwreck.

It is no exaggeration to say that
a man's education is worth much
or little to him in proportion to the
largeness of his aim. An education
undertaken with a low aim may
lead to accomplishments ; high
aims lead to culture. The larger
aim involves the love of truth for
itself; and this tends to that self
subordination essential to him who
would bring party, creed, theory,
to the test of reason. Such a man
is the scholar. The conditions to
which a scholar is called upon to
submit seem severe. The univer
sity ideal speaks to him in the
voice of the Master: "Sell all that
thou hast, and come, follow me!"
The man whose face falls at this,
and who turns away because he
has, or hopes for, great possessions,
is not worthy to be a follower of
Truth. Obedience to the voice of
the ideal is the touchstone of the
scholar.
Sometimes, indeed, the sacrifice

is more apparent than real. Solo

riches, and wealth, and honor were

Had Saul sought his father's asses
with no thought beyond, he would
have deserved to remain an ass

"Among the objects of human

Professor M. B. Anderson's speech
upon " President Jordan's Address
and the University Ideal," given
tonight, was, in part, as follows:
Professor Anderson's Address.
The burden of President Jordan's
address lies, it seems to me, in the
stress he lays upon the importance
of a right atmosphere about the
University : pure, clear air, full
charged with spiritual ozone. Of
such an atmosphere the main ele
ments, he tells us, are Truth, Char
acter, Beauty. This is the holy
trinity of university influences,
quickening to the soul as moun
tain air to the body. These stim
ulating influences defy analysis.
With what instruments of precision
are we to weigh human character?
Who has made answer to the ques
tion of the incredulous Pilate,
" What is truth " ? Does not Beauty,
like the rainbow, forever elude the
pursuer ? Yet these words stand
for primal realities. They mean
something even to the thoughtless
or flippant; and more and more to
us, as climbing the mountain of
spiritual endeavor, our vision wid
ens. At moments like this, when
we stop to look back upon the way
we have come, and to gaze forward
and up to the solemn heights, it is
well to try to freshen our sense of
the meaning of these mysterious
quickening influences : Truth, Cha
racter, Beauty.
To consider them all is beyond
the scope of the few words I may
permit myself. I will merely in
vite your attention to some consid
erations which appear to grow nat
urally out of President Jordan's
beautiful and suggestive words con
cerning the central importance of
the power and influence of Truth.
The power of Truth is emphasized
as the primary element, the oxy
gen, of the university atmosphere.
I hope it may be assumed that a
student of belles-lettres has no
reason to fear the suspicion of un
dervaluing the power and influence
of Beauty. It wp.s the poet Keats,
the worshipper of Beauty, who
wrought his ode, the exquisite Gre
cian Urn, into a vase for that
flower of thought, " Beauty is truth,
truth beauty." Tohim was unveiled
the vision of ideal Beauty ; perhaps
we may concede that he had some
glimpse of Truth, also. He was
possessed, as all poets and many
philosophers have been, with a
sense of the essential harmony of
the two powers : he saw the figure of
Truth wearing Beauty as a gar
ment.
As to the power of Character, he
would be a-false teacher who could
speak of it as essentially secondary..
A character, — free, pure, noble, —
is beyond rubies, beyond even
learning. In theschool of the world,
Character occupies the supreme

place. It stands to Beauty and
Truth in the same relative position
as that assigned by St. Paul to Love
among the Christian graces. When
we enter a university we do not
leave the school of the world ; in
the university, as everywhere else,
" conduct is three-fourths of life."
And the university is, indeed, an
excellent school of character,
though in this respect it does not
enjoy pre-eminence over other de
partments of the school of life. The
home, the street, the church, the
forum, the sick-room, — wherever
men meet to be tested and tempted
there is a school of conduct, a
course in character.
Eh bildet ein Talent sicli in der Stille,
Sicli ein Karakterin dem Strom der Welt,
says Goethe. A talent shapes itself
in solitude, but Character in the
very tide of life. If, then, the uni
versity recognizes, in its field and
for its purposes, the paramount
value of Truth, there is involved no
disparagement of the claims of
Character. As well might we sus
pect Keats of undervaluing Beauty
in giving the supreme place, in the
"Ode to a Grecian Urn," to the
statement of an abstract truth, es
sentially impractical. Jt is by
their loyalty to truth, that the stu
dent, the investigator, exemplify
the power of character. Scholar
ship involves the severest disci
pline of the Character. Certainly
no one can be a great teacher with
out having high character, as well
as culture of intellect. At the uni
versity plastic spirits are some
times cast in the mould of a great
teacher. Hut the process is liable
to accident, to interruption. The
cast may suffer disfigurement be
fore it hardens. Or, possibly, there
may not be metal enough to till the
mould. The point to be made clear
is, that for this high and difficult
and all-important discipline which
we call the cultivation of Character
the university may claim no unas
sailable pre eminence.
One would perhaps not be wide
of the mark in roughly defining a
university as a gathering of
scholars and learners engaged in
the disinterested pursuit of Truth.
Brief and general as it is, this
definition contains elements the
examination of which would lead
far beyond our present scope. It
would be instructive, for example,
to dwell with Leasing and Milton
upon the principle that our spirit
ual safety lies, not at all in the
fancied possession of the Truth, but
altogether in the unceasing search
for it. At the present moment,
however, it seems even more im
portant to consider that element of
the definition suggested by the
word disinterested. Some reaction
ary bodies still hold, with their
eloquent spokesman, Cardinal New
man, to the mediaeval conception
of the university, according to
which it is, for the intellectual
realm, a kind of Holy Roman Em
pire, striving, apparently with
small success, to co-ordinate the
jarring provinces of law, of medi
cine, of philosophy, and "alas, also
theology." The university, so con
ceived, had been found wanting by
Bacon and by Milton, long before
Goethe justly and decisively satir
ized it in his "Faust." it is in
structive to contrast this outworn
type, which is still extant in some
quarters, with the modern ideal,
sketched by that sagacious thinker,
I rofessor Huxley. The university,
according to Huxley, "is not pri
marily an institution for testing
the work of schoolmasters, or for
ascertaining the fitness of young
men to be curates, lawyers, or doc
tors." Positively it is a place where
"a man who claims to devote him
self to science or art should be able
to find some one who can teach
him what is already known, and
train him in the methods of know
ing more." " The professors have to
be at the top of the wave of prog
ress. Research and criticism must
be the breath of their nostrils."
Those who have had the shaping
of this University have had in
view the ultimate realization of the
modern ideal. No doubt most of
the professors lament their inability
to realize it at once. Much pioneer
work has to be undertaken; work
of collegiate rather than university
grade has to be done; the public
has to be educated to a more lib
eral conception of the scholar's
function. Courses of study must
be given which are in the nature
of expedients: scaffoldings conveni
ent in the building process.
Meanwhile there is for the stu
dent an ever-present danger against
which he requires to be fortified.
The student who comes here, osten
sibly at least, for liberal culture, is
pursued to our doors and within
them, by the commercial spirit,
tempting him to gauge the things
of the mind by material standards.
I have not here in view the tech
nical student, who is engaged in a
worthy effort to fit himself to earn
a living. Such a person is not
properly a university student. He
often regards himself as unfor
tunate that he has not the means
to give himself a liberal course of
training. The danger is lest some
of those who have the means and
the aptitude be retarded by a nar
row outlook and a mean aim. To
such one can do no better service
than to hold up the university
ideal of intellectual disinterested
ness. The voice of the world and
perhaps the uncertainty or his per
sonal future, make him timid.
Finding himself free to elect, in
stead of taking counsel of his
nobler instincts, he listens to the
voice of the world, to the hard, sel
fish commercial spirit, which ad
vises him to reject such courses as
are not "practical." Accordingly,
he goes about anxiously inquiring
how this course or that course will
forward him in the race for wealth
or office. He soon comes to. look
upon education as a process of
training his nerve and whetting
his teeth to snatch the bone from
the under dog.
It is no exaggeration to say that
a man's education is worth much
or little to him in proportion to the
largeness of his aim. An education
undertaken with a low aim may
lead to accomplishments ; high
aims lead to culture. The larger

small success, to co-ordinate the
jarring provinces of law, of medi
cine, of philosophy, and "alas, also
theology." The university, so con
ceived, had been found wanting by
Bacon and by Milton, long before
Goethe justly and decisively satir
ized it in his "Faust." it is in
structive to contrast this outworn
type, which is still extant in some
quarters, with the modern ideal,
sketched by that sagacious thinker,
I rofessor Huxley. The university,
according to Huxley, "is not pri
marily an institution for testing
the work of schoolmasters, or for
ascertaining the fitness of young
men to be curates, lawyers, or doc
tors." Positively it is a place where
"a man who claims to devote him
self to science or art should be able
to find some one who can teach
him what is already known, and
train him in the methods of know
ing more." " The professors have to
be at the top of the wave of prog
ress. Research and criticism must
be the breath of their nostrils."
Those who have had the shaping
of this University have had in
view the ultimate realization of the
modern ideal. No doubt most of
the professors lament their inability
to realize it at once. Much pioneer
work has to be undertaken; work
of collegiate rather than university
grade has to be done; the public
has to be educated to a more lib
eral conception of the scholar's
function. Courses of study must
be given which are in the nature
of expedients: scaffoldings conveni
ent in the building process.
Meanwhile there is for the stu
dent an ever-present danger against
which he requires to be fortified.
The student who comes here, osten
sibly at least, for liberal culture, is
pursued to our doors and within
them, by the commercial spirit,
tempting him to gauge the things
of the mind by material standards.
I have not here in view the tech
nical student, who is engaged in a
worthy effort to fit himself to earn
a living. Such a person is not
properly a university student. He
often regards himself as unfor
tunate that he has not the means
to give himself a liberal course of
training. The danger is lest some
of those who have the means and
the aptitude be retarded by a nar
row outlook and a mean aim. To
such one can do no better service
than to hold up the university
ideal of intellectual disinterested
ness. The voice of the world and
perhaps the uncertainty or his per
sonal future, make him timid.
Finding himself free to elect, in
stead of taking counsel of his
nobler instincts, he listens to the
voice of the world, to the hard, sel
fish commercial spirit, which ad
vises him to reject such courses as
are not "practical." Accordingly,
he goes about anxiously inquiring
how this course or that course will
forward him in the race for wealth
or office. He soon comes to. look
upon education as a process of
training his nerve and whetting
his teeth to snatch the bone from
the under dog.
It is no exaggeration to say that
a man's education is worth much
or little to him in proportion to the
largeness of his aim. An education
undertaken with a low aim may
lead to accomplishments ; high
aims lead to culture. The larger
aim involves the love of truth for
itself; and this tends to that self
subordination essential to him who
would bring party, creed, theory,
to the test of reason. Such a man
is the scholar. The conditions to
which a scholar is called upon to
submit seem severe. The univer
sity ideal speaks to him in the
voice of the Master: "Sell all that
thou hast, and come, follow me!"
The man whose face falls at this,
and who turns away because he
has, or hopes for, great possessions,
is not worthy to be a follower of
Truth. Obedience to the voice of
the ideal is the touchstone of the
scholar.
Sometimes, indeed, the sacrifice

Had Saul sought his father's asses
with no thought beyond, he would
have deserved to remain an ass

Professor M. B. Anderson's speech
upon " President Jordan's Address
and the University Ideal," given
tonight, was, in part, as follows:
Professor Anderson's Address.
The burden of President Jordan's
address lies, it seems to me, in the
stress he lays upon the importance
of a right atmosphere about the
University : pure, clear air, full
charged with spiritual ozone. Of
such an atmosphere the main ele
ments, he tells us, are Truth, Char
acter, Beauty. This is the holy
trinity of university influences,
quickening to the soul as moun
tain air to the body. These stim
ulating influences defy analysis.
With what instruments of precision
are we to weigh human character?
Who has made answer to the ques
tion of the incredulous Pilate,
" What is truth " ? Does not Beauty,
like the rainbow, forever elude the
pursuer ? Yet these words stand
for primal realities. They mean
something even to the thoughtless
or flippant; and more and more to
us, as climbing the mountain of
spiritual endeavor, our vision wid
ens. At moments like this, when
we stop to look back upon the way
we have come, and to gaze forward
and up to the solemn heights, it is
well to try to freshen our sense of
the meaning of these mysterious
quickening influences : Truth, Cha
racter, Beauty.
To consider them all is beyond
the scope of the few words I may
permit myself. I will merely in
vite your attention to some consid
erations which appear to grow nat
urally out of President Jordan's
beautiful and suggestive words con
cerning the central importance of
the power and influence of Truth.
The power of Truth is emphasized
as the primary element, the oxy
gen, of the university atmosphere.
I hope it may be assumed that a
student of belles-lettres has no
reason to fear the suspicion of un
dervaluing the power and influence
of Beauty. It wp.s the poet Keats,
the worshipper of Beauty, who
wrought his ode, the exquisite Gre
cian Urn, into a vase for that
flower of thought, " Beauty is truth,
truth beauty." Tohim was unveiled
the vision of ideal Beauty ; perhaps
we may concede that he had some
glimpse of Truth, also. He was
possessed, as all poets and many
philosophers have been, with a
sense of the essential harmony of
the two powers : he saw the figure of
Truth wearing Beauty as a gar
ment.
As to the power of Character, he
would be a-false teacher who could
speak of it as essentially secondary..
A character, — free, pure, noble, —
is beyond rubies, beyond even
learning. In theschool of the world,
Character occupies the supreme

place. It stands to Beauty and
Truth in the same relative position
as that assigned by St. Paul to Love
among the Christian graces. When
we enter a university we do not
leave the school of the world ; in
the university, as everywhere else,
" conduct is three-fourths of life."
And the university is, indeed, an
excellent school of character,
though in this respect it does not
enjoy pre-eminence over other de
partments of the school of life. The
home, the street, the church, the
forum, the sick-room, — wherever
men meet to be tested and tempted
there is a school of conduct, a
course in character.
Eh bildet ein Talent sicli in der Stille,
Sicli ein Karakterin dem Strom der Welt,
says Goethe. A talent shapes itself
in solitude, but Character in the
very tide of life. If, then, the uni
versity recognizes, in its field and
for its purposes, the paramount
value of Truth, there is involved no
disparagement of the claims of
Character. As well might we sus
pect Keats of undervaluing Beauty
in giving the supreme place, in the
"Ode to a Grecian Urn," to the
statement of an abstract truth, es
sentially impractical. Jt is by
their loyalty to truth, that the stu
dent, the investigator, exemplify
the power of character. Scholar
ship involves the severest disci
pline of the Character. Certainly
no one can be a great teacher with
out having high character, as well
as culture of intellect. At the uni
versity plastic spirits are some
times cast in the mould of a great
teacher. Hut the process is liable
to accident, to interruption. The
cast may suffer disfigurement be
fore it hardens. Or, possibly, there
may not be metal enough to till the
mould. The point to be made clear
is, that for this high and difficult
and all-important discipline which
we call the cultivation of Character
the university may claim no unas
sailable pre eminence.
One would perhaps not be wide
of the mark in roughly defining a
university as a gathering of
scholars and learners engaged in
the disinterested pursuit of Truth.
Brief and general as it is, this
definition contains elements the
examination of which would lead
far beyond our present scope. It
would be instructive, for example,
to dwell with Leasing and Milton
upon the principle that our spirit
ual safety lies, not at all in the
fancied possession of the Truth, but
altogether in the unceasing search
for it. At the present moment,
however, it seems even more im
portant to consider that element of
the definition suggested by the
word disinterested. Some reaction
ary bodies still hold, with their
eloquent spokesman, Cardinal New
man, to the mediaeval conception
of the university, according to
which it is, for the intellectual
realm, a kind of Holy Roman Em
pire, striving, apparently with
small success, to co-ordinate the
jarring provinces of law, of medi
cine, of philosophy, and "alas, also
theology." The university, so con
ceived, had been found wanting by
Bacon and by Milton, long before
