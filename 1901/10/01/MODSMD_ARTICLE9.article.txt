The following article, written by
Mrs. Ellen Coit Elliott, wife of
Registrar Elliott, is the best
recorded account of the pioneer
days during the early part of the
first year of Stanford history. It
was first published in the Cornell
Magazine of December, 1891, hav
ing been written primarily, as its
title indicated, to give news of the
''Cornell Colony at Palo Alto." It
was republished in the fourth num
ber of the Sequoia, January 20,
1392, and tonight Mrs. Elliott
read it at the decennial anniversary
exercises. Omitting the introduc
tory paragraph, which referred to
the prominence of the Cornell
colony, the article is as follows:
Mrs. Elliott's Paper.
The first arrival of the President,
the Registrar, and the professor of
chemistry, occurred so long ago
as to seem like ancient history. In
reality, it was somewhere near the
first of July, but as one looks back
ward, what a stretch intervenes.
The first of July workmen swarmed
through the buildings of the quad
rangle. The boys' dormitory was
building; the girls' dormitory
barely begun. Alvarado row, now
standing complete, with its ten pro
fessors'cottages done and occupied,
was then an unbroken stubble
field, and the plans for its houses

just being drawn. The sun was
shining placid and hot out of a
metallic blue sky, and dusty Cali
fornians were overwhelming the
new comers witli eulogies upon the
climate.
The journey from the East had
taken perhaps a week, and during
that time an astounding mail had
accumulated in the iMenlo Park
post office. Four or live hundred
letters demanded instant answers.
No offices being ready for occu
pancy, the library of the Presi
dential residence, Escondite Cot
tage, was the first work-room, and
later an upper room in a small
brick building near by was utilized.
In three weeks the Registrar's
office in the quadrangle received
the President, the Registrar, and
the stenographer, who had, mean
time, been imported from Cornell.
There toiled the vanguard, feeling,
no doubt, that L'Universite c'ext
moi. They had six roller-top desks
standing around, but nothing else
to speak of, and they were assisted
in their labors by the presence of
carpenters tinkering at drawers,
putting latches on doors, and in
terminably rubbing down the wood
work.
Events ripened fast. Ground was
broken for the cottages, the Palo
Alto road, leading to the station,
was being macadamized, concrete
pavements were being laid, the Art
Museum was growing Jike a mush
room, the dormitories approached
completion. Piano agents appeared
desiring to furnish the University
with their wares. Bookstore agents
looked over the ground with a view
to establishing branches. Land
agents busily boomed the property
about Palo Alto, one of them gen
erously offering the Registrar a per
cent, on all sales made through his
influence. A detective came down
to interview the President upon the
feasability of establishing himself
upon the campus in anticipation of
finding his services needed after
the students arrived. Teachers
from Maine to Australia were ex
pressing their willingness to he in
cluded in the magic fifteen who
were to compose the first faculty,
and students "from the kinder
garten up" were seeking admission
to " Mr. Stanford's school." All
California was looking with intense
curiosity at the modest nucleus of
the long-expected University. Some
were grumbling because a complete
preparatory system was not to be
inaugurated the first year, others
were criticising the architecture of
the buildings; many were asking,
skeptically, "Will it really open on
the first of October?" and many
were hospitably welcoming the
Easterners and rejoicing at the im
pulse the new institution had even
then begun to give to the schools of
the State.
With August the faculty began
to arrive. Events had moved too
fast for them, for having been in
formed in April that no houses for
the professors were to be put up at
present, and that they might find
accommodations in the boys' dor
mitory, they had all embraced cor
dially the notion of boarding a
year. When they were informed
in July that the plans were
changed, ten cottages would be
built, and the professors would be
expected to live in them, they for
the most part wrote back that " My
wife and I prefer to board the first
year. If we cannot go into the dor
mitory, we will establish ourselves
in Menlo Park or Mayfield."

Accordingly they sold off their
furniture, and arrived upon the
scene with the boarding notion as
firmly fixed as ever. Then it was
amusing—nay, affecting—to note
the change of attitude brought
about by contact with the "in
evitable fact." Landed at Menlo
it was found that no private family
could be induced to take boarders
011 any terms. The couple would
then perhaps explore the ranch and
peep longingly into the clustered
tents of the workmen. And finally,
after a last reassurance from the
office that, unfortunately, they
could not go into the dormitory,
they would turn toward the row,
and picking their reluctant way
over adobe, lumber and debris,
proceed to the depressing choice of
one of the ten new skeletons for
their home. Why we should all
have been so possessed with the
idea of a year's boarding might be
hard to explain, and now that we
have all been gently coerced into
the places prepared for us, there is
probably not a family which does
not rejoice to be under a roof of its
own.
About this time, when more were
coming and the cottages almost
completed, shopping trips to San
Francisco became the order of the
day. At this stage of the proceed
ings no one had a nurse-maid, so
the children had frequently to be
left in charge of their learned
fathers while the mothers took the
early train to the city. Ladies'
memorandums were an interesting
study, for, in view of the patient
gentleman nurses left behind, one
precious day must be crowded to
its utmost capacity, and the arti
cles to be purchased ranged from
parlor carpets down to clothespins
at four dozen for"a bit." October
first was almost here before the first
family took possession of its house,
and, while the stars looked in at
the curtainless windows, slept 011
the floor with a sense of vast relief
in being at last "at home."
The summer had been interest
ing, but not always easy. With
the cloudless sky always beaming
above us we perversely longed for
the patter of rain. With palms
and cacti galore our souls yearned
after grass. With the most perfect
dust in existence powdered white
over the vegetation, we unreason
ably missed our mud. With thirteen
flourishing saloons to comfort us
and the three hundred other inhab
itants of Menlo Park, we still
thought regretfully of some trim
little elm-shadowed villages of the
East. For those who came early
the waiting was long. So long we
watched the workmen hammering
away under the arcades, and won
dered if ever the long aisles would
resound with more scholastic
echoes. So long we endured the
stuffy rooms and lamentable food
of our boarding-places. So long
the half-dozen gentlemen walked
daily through the beating sun the
two dusty miles to Menlo Park and
earned by this defiance of Califor
nia custom the sobriquet of "tramp
professors." They carried their
lunches in little baskets, and when
noon came it was truly interesting
to behold this embryonic faculty
eating its dinner. They sat in a
picturesque row under the arches,
resting themselves upon the low
stone wall bounding the arcade.
The lunches were dreadful aggre
gations and quite inadequate in
quantity besides. And these poor
scholars, founders of a great uni
