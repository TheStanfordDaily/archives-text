The following article, written by
Mrs. Ellen Coit Elliott, wife of
Registrar Elliott, is the best
recorded account of the pioneer
days during the early part of the
first year of Stanford history. It
was first published in the Cornell
Magazine of December, 1891, hav
ing been written primarily, as its
title indicated, to give news of the
''Cornell Colony at Palo Alto." It
was republished in the fourth num
ber of the Sequoia, January 20,
1392, and tonight Mrs. Elliott
read it at the decennial anniversary
exercises. Omitting the introduc
tory paragraph, which referred to
the prominence of the Cornell
colony, the article is as follows:
Mrs. Elliott's Paper.
The first arrival of the President,
the Registrar, and the professor of
chemistry, occurred so long ago
as to seem like ancient history. In
reality, it was somewhere near the
first of July, but as one looks back
ward, what a stretch intervenes.
The first of July workmen swarmed
through the buildings of the quad
rangle. The boys' dormitory was
building; the girls' dormitory
barely begun. Alvarado row, now
standing complete, with its ten pro
fessors'cottages done and occupied,
was then an unbroken stubble
field, and the plans for its houses

just being drawn. The sun was
shining placid and hot out of a
metallic blue sky, and dusty Cali
fornians were overwhelming the
new comers witli eulogies upon the
climate.
The journey from the East had
taken perhaps a week, and during
that time an astounding mail had
accumulated in the iMenlo Park
post office. Four or live hundred
letters demanded instant answers.
No offices being ready for occu
pancy, the library of the Presi
dential residence, Escondite Cot
tage, was the first work-room, and
later an upper room in a small
brick building near by was utilized.
In three weeks the Registrar's
office in the quadrangle received
the President, the Registrar, and
the stenographer, who had, mean
time, been imported from Cornell.
There toiled the vanguard, feeling,
no doubt, that L'Universite c'ext
moi. They had six roller-top desks
standing around, but nothing else
to speak of, and they were assisted
in their labors by the presence of
carpenters tinkering at drawers,
putting latches on doors, and in
terminably rubbing down the wood
work.
Events ripened fast. Ground was
broken for the cottages, the Palo
Alto road, leading to the station,
was being macadamized, concrete
pavements were being laid, the Art
Museum was growing Jike a mush
room, the dormitories approached
completion. Piano agents appeared
desiring to furnish the University
with their wares. Bookstore agents
looked over the ground with a view
to establishing branches. Land
agents busily boomed the property
about Palo Alto, one of them gen
erously offering the Registrar a per
cent, on all sales made through his
influence. A detective came down
to interview the President upon the
feasability of establishing himself
upon the campus in anticipation of
finding his services needed after
the students arrived. Teachers
from Maine to Australia were ex
pressing their willingness to he in
cluded in the magic fifteen who
were to compose the first faculty,
and students "from the kinder
garten up" were seeking admission
to " Mr. Stanford's school." All
California was looking with intense
curiosity at the modest nucleus of
the long-expected University. Some
were grumbling because a complete
preparatory system was not to be
inaugurated the first year, others
were criticising the architecture of
the buildings; many were asking,
skeptically, "Will it really open on
the first of October?" and many
were hospitably welcoming the
Easterners and rejoicing at the im
pulse the new institution had even
then begun to give to the schools of
the State.
With August the faculty began
to arrive. Events had moved too
fast for them, for having been in
formed in April that no houses for
the professors were to be put up at
present, and that they might find
accommodations in the boys' dor
mitory, they had all embraced cor
dially the notion of boarding a
year. When they were informed
in July that the plans were
changed, ten cottages would be
built, and the professors would be
expected to live in them, they for
the most part wrote back that " My
wife and I prefer to board the first
year. If we cannot go into the dor
mitory, we will establish ourselves
in Menlo Park or Mayfield."

Accordingly they sold off their
furniture, and arrived upon the
scene with the boarding notion as
firmly fixed as ever. Then it was
amusing—nay, affecting—to note
the change of attitude brought
about by contact with the "in
evitable fact." Landed at Menlo
it was found that no private family
could be induced to take boarders
011 any terms. The couple would
then perhaps explore the ranch and
peep longingly into the clustered
tents of the workmen. And finally,
after a last reassurance from the
office that, unfortunately, they
could not go into the dormitory,
they would turn toward the row,
and picking their reluctant way
over adobe, lumber and debris,
proceed to the depressing choice of
one of the ten new skeletons for
their home. Why we should all
have been so possessed with the
idea of a year's boarding might be
hard to explain, and now that we
have all been gently coerced into
the places prepared for us, there is
probably not a family which does
not rejoice to be under a roof of its
own.
About this time, when more were
coming and the cottages almost
completed, shopping trips to San
Francisco became the order of the
day. At this stage of the proceed
ings no one had a nurse-maid, so
the children had frequently to be
left in charge of their learned
fathers while the mothers took the
early train to the city. Ladies'
memorandums were an interesting
study, for, in view of the patient
gentleman nurses left behind, one
precious day must be crowded to
its utmost capacity, and the arti
cles to be purchased ranged from
parlor carpets down to clothespins
at four dozen for"a bit." October
first was almost here before the first
family took possession of its house,
and, while the stars looked in at
the curtainless windows, slept 011
the floor with a sense of vast relief
in being at last "at home."
The summer had been interest
ing, but not always easy. With
the cloudless sky always beaming
above us we perversely longed for
the patter of rain. With palms
and cacti galore our souls yearned
after grass. With the most perfect
dust in existence powdered white
over the vegetation, we unreason
ably missed our mud. With thirteen
flourishing saloons to comfort us
and the three hundred other inhab
itants of Menlo Park, we still
thought regretfully of some trim
little elm-shadowed villages of the
East. For those who came early
the waiting was long. So long we
watched the workmen hammering
away under the arcades, and won
dered if ever the long aisles would
resound with more scholastic
echoes. So long we endured the
stuffy rooms and lamentable food
of our boarding-places. So long
the half-dozen gentlemen walked
daily through the beating sun the
two dusty miles to Menlo Park and
earned by this defiance of Califor
nia custom the sobriquet of "tramp
professors." They carried their
lunches in little baskets, and when
noon came it was truly interesting
to behold this embryonic faculty
eating its dinner. They sat in a
picturesque row under the arches,
resting themselves upon the low
stone wall bounding the arcade.
The lunches were dreadful aggre
gations and quite inadequate in
quantity besides. And these poor
scholars, founders of a great uni
versity, were said to look with envy
upon the stenographer who bad a
phenomenal landlady and brought
large pieces of frosted cake, and to
cast surreptitious glances toward
the basket of the President, who
brought his dinner from his own
menage and ate it contentedly at
the point of the jack-knife.
The Professor from Boston used
to flee to the city every day or so,
ostensibly on business, but in real
ity—as he confessed when the libra
rian charged him with it —" to get
a cup of coffee." This practice
nearly got him into trouble, for
presently, among the bills for uni
versity material sent from the city
office to the office of the President for
auditing, there came one from a city
restaurant bearing the simple leg
end: "Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, Dr.: To one terrapin stew,
$1.25."
Suspicion at once fastened upon
the man who went to the city for cof
fee, and it was only with difficulty
that he was able to clear himself of
the charge of carousing upon terra
pin stew at the University's ex
pense.
So the summer passed away,
and enthusiasts though they were,
there might have been in the heart
of each one sometime a secret
thought fitly expressed in a brief
dialogue I overheard one day. Two
were standing on the hotel porch
at twilight watching the train across
the road getting ready to start for
San Francisco. Said one, deject
edly, "Let's get on board and go
home," and the other answered
with alacrity, "Any moment you
please."
But when September arrived and
the rest of the faculty began to
come in rapidly; when the build
ings of the quadrangle one by one
grew silent and completed; when
registration day approached and
all work rushed forward to the be
ginning of the term, such excresent
regret as there was died forgotten
and all interest centered on the
coming opening.
The people of the State were at
last convinced that the University
intended to begin in earnest on the
Ist of October, and they came in
force to attend the exercises of that
day. Some one reported that " in
the early morning the streets of
San .Jose and Santa Clara were
alive with vehicles carrying people
to Palo Alto," and, although this
has a slightly mythical sound, it is
certain that long before the time
for beginning the audience was
gathering upon "the ranch." The
horses were tied wherever there was
place round about and the visitors
pressed into the quadrangle and
took up the seats. Trains ran up
to the buildings on the switch used
to bring freight from the railroad,
and unloaded guests on the spot.
By half-past ten, when the exer
cises commenced, the "great,
bright quadrangle contained some
thing over an acre of humanity,"
if I may be permitted the expres
sion. The seats in front of the
platform were full, back of them
hundreds stood up, and those who
could find no place within earshot
promenaded the arcades and talked.
• The sky was at its bluest, and
the red tile of the low continuous
roofs glowed against it with a soft
brilliance. Again, below the buff
stone, the shadowed arcades, the
eight banks of greenest foliage
rising from the quadrangle floor,
the gay flags and flowers decorating
three entrances, and on the fourth

side the entrance arch transformed
into an embowered alcove about
the speakers' platform; the golden
California sunshine glinting radi
antly over the whole. To right and
left of the platform pampas plumes
and palms sprang lifteen feet up
into the light. Lower down pal
mettos and delicate bamboo sprays
encircled the edge and were them
selves encircled by long festoons of
grapes banging in gigantic clusters
entirely across. The Stars and
Stripes fell in rich folds at the sides
of the alcove. Overhead fluttered
banners, while a fringe of drooping
eucalyptus seemed to supply the
one tender minor note in the tri
umphant decorative harmony, turn
ing our eyes and thoughts to the
portrait of the boy, Leland Stan
lord, which looked down upon us
with so serious eyes from the
alcove's background.
When Mr. and Mrs. Stanford ap
peared, the University slogan was
for the first time heard. Some four
hundred students were present,
seated together near the platform,
and at this moment, after three
cheers, they gave down very credit
ably and with immense enthusi
asm, " Wahoo! Wahoo! L. S. J.
U!. Stanford!" Then we felt that
the University was born. The re
porters, "seated in a body in the
little pen under the platform's
edge, have given to the world a
sufficiently detailed account of the
exercises. The cameras perched
pracariously upon the roofs or
mounted on stilts in the midst of
the audience, have revealed to a
continent the fact that the repre
sentative of the Board of Trustees
made his address under the shadow
of a parasol held by the President;
while the President, when bespoke,
was in turn protected by the pro
fessor of mathematics. Has the
public also been told that when the
proceedings were over and the fav
ored guests had gone to lunch at
the Stanford residence, the crowd
sat down in the cool arcades to eat
its lunch, and for dessert appro
priated the decorative grapes from
the deserted rostrum?
Four hundred students, both dor
mitories full, Alvarado row almost
settled, classroom work begun —so
it looked the Monday after opening
day. Four hundred and seventy
live is the number at present. They
have had their first disturbance at
Encina Hull, with an expulsion or
so following, and settled down to
work.
The month between has been busy
and progressive. The boys'gymnas
ium has gone up, more professors'
houses are begun, and Alvarado
row has its sidewalk. With the
unexpected number of students the
President has renewed his con
genial activity in the matter of ap
pointing new instructors. We have
begun to make our newspaper rep
utation. Out of their own rich ex
perience, Cornel lians will sym
pathize with our dismay when we
discovered, taking its unhindered
march through the press, the
amazing statement that "Senator
Stanford claimed the right to expel
students who do not behave as he
thinks they should do, and that
200 boys were recently saved from
expulsion only by the intercession
of Mrs. Stanford with the infuri
ated old man." When a Western
journal takes the trouble to fabri
cate, it spares no pains to place its
produce at the top. The fine and
generous amplitude of the "200
students," and the exquisite in

appropriateness of the wild and
wooly adjective applied to the
gentlest of men, could hardly be
equalled in the effete East, and
mark the fiction as an indigenous
growth of our adopted soil.
The quadrangle is busy now with
its proper activity. Classrooms are
full to overflowing; and when the
triangle suspended in the archway
jangles musically the signal for
change, the passing of the students
fills the colonnades with a stream
of life and motion. Between hours
a studious silence reigns, gently
broken by the murmur of the lec
turer's voice as it sounds through
the open window. A student or two
crossing the court, a group or two
studying under the arcade's airy
shelter, accent the scholastic intent.
Back and forth from Palo Alto
station lumbers Paulsen's mam
moth omnibus, characteristically
built to hold forty passengers, and
with it runs a smaller vehicle, fun
nily labeled "Stanford's Univer
sity." Back and forth from the
station, morning and night, from
San Jose, from Santa Clara, from
lied wood, from San Francisco
even, come and go non-resident
students.
It would be no wonder if the
rumor were true that Alvarado row
has been dubbed by the students
"The Decalogue," for up out of the
stubbletield rises this row of ten, as
yet unsoftened by lawn or shrub or
tree, and presenting to Encina, at
the other edge of the stubble, a
front of uncompromising rectitude,
perhaps sufficiently suggestive of
the moral law. At meal time, from
one end of the row to the other, the
various professors may be seen to
issue from their various houses
bearing pails —wooden pails, gran
ite-ware pails, tin milk-pails, any
kind of pails —and wending their
way to the huge, unsightly water
tank which stores the precious yield
of an artesian well near one end of
the row. About the same time if
you look out of your backdoor, you
will see various of the faculty
ladies picking up chips to start the
fire with, or even gathering in
wood from the huge wood-piles.
One day we beheld the professor of
pedagogy striding across the open
toward May held, and presently
back he strode again, bearing in his
hand a vermilion buck-saw, and
was soon thereafter decried attack
ing his wood-pile with all his char
acteristic energy. All this pending
the advent of servants and consid
erations of propriety. Pending the
advent of the electric light, the
flicker of the tallow dip was for
some days the only light shed upon
the student page at Roble and En
cina. The candle is still in vogue
in the row, and as electricity is ex
pected at any moment, a redwood
block or a bottle serves every pur
pose for holding the primitive
taper.
Perhaps it is the spirit of the
West, perhaps it is the vital breath
of the Pacificcoming into us over the
mountains, but whatever it may
be, some enchantment, has blinded
us to the crudities, the drawbacks,
the limitations of our state. The
giants looming in the path of the
pioneer appear but frivolous wind
mills in our eyes. Come not out to us,
oh, doubting Cornellians, thinking
to return untouched by the unrea
sonable enthusiasm. Christmas
shall bring you, and the months of
spring shall bring you, critical,
skeptical, curious, sneering after
our library, questioning about our

funds, and you shall return —if
you return at all —chanting aw fer
vently and irrelevantly as we " Die
1 lift der Freiheit weht."

President has renewed his con
genial activity in the matter of ap
pointing new instructors. We have
begun to make our newspaper rep
utation. Out of their own rich ex
perience, Cornel lians will sym
pathize with our dismay when we
discovered, taking its unhindered
march through the press, the
amazing statement that "Senator
Stanford claimed the right to expel
students who do not behave as he
thinks they should do, and that
200 boys were recently saved from
expulsion only by the intercession
of Mrs. Stanford with the infuri
ated old man." When a Western
journal takes the trouble to fabri
cate, it spares no pains to place its
produce at the top. The fine and
generous amplitude of the "200
students," and the exquisite in

appropriateness of the wild and
wooly adjective applied to the
gentlest of men, could hardly be
equalled in the effete East, and
mark the fiction as an indigenous
growth of our adopted soil.
The quadrangle is busy now with
its proper activity. Classrooms are
full to overflowing; and when the
triangle suspended in the archway
jangles musically the signal for
change, the passing of the students
fills the colonnades with a stream
of life and motion. Between hours
a studious silence reigns, gently
broken by the murmur of the lec
turer's voice as it sounds through
the open window. A student or two
crossing the court, a group or two
studying under the arcade's airy
shelter, accent the scholastic intent.
Back and forth from Palo Alto
station lumbers Paulsen's mam
moth omnibus, characteristically
built to hold forty passengers, and
with it runs a smaller vehicle, fun
nily labeled "Stanford's Univer
sity." Back and forth from the
station, morning and night, from
San Jose, from Santa Clara, from
lied wood, from San Francisco
even, come and go non-resident
students.
It would be no wonder if the
rumor were true that Alvarado row
has been dubbed by the students
"The Decalogue," for up out of the
stubbletield rises this row of ten, as
yet unsoftened by lawn or shrub or
tree, and presenting to Encina, at
the other edge of the stubble, a
front of uncompromising rectitude,
perhaps sufficiently suggestive of
the moral law. At meal time, from
one end of the row to the other, the
various professors may be seen to
issue from their various houses
bearing pails —wooden pails, gran
ite-ware pails, tin milk-pails, any
kind of pails —and wending their
way to the huge, unsightly water
tank which stores the precious yield
of an artesian well near one end of
the row. About the same time if
you look out of your backdoor, you
will see various of the faculty
ladies picking up chips to start the
fire with, or even gathering in
wood from the huge wood-piles.
One day we beheld the professor of
pedagogy striding across the open
toward May held, and presently
back he strode again, bearing in his
hand a vermilion buck-saw, and
was soon thereafter decried attack
ing his wood-pile with all his char
acteristic energy. All this pending
the advent of servants and consid
erations of propriety. Pending the
advent of the electric light, the
flicker of the tallow dip was for
some days the only light shed upon
the student page at Roble and En
cina. The candle is still in vogue
in the row, and as electricity is ex
pected at any moment, a redwood
block or a bottle serves every pur
pose for holding the primitive
taper.
Perhaps it is the spirit of the
West, perhaps it is the vital breath
of the Pacificcoming into us over the
mountains, but whatever it may
be, some enchantment, has blinded
us to the crudities, the drawbacks,
the limitations of our state. The
giants looming in the path of the
pioneer appear but frivolous wind
mills in our eyes. Come not out to us,
oh, doubting Cornellians, thinking
to return untouched by the unrea
sonable enthusiasm. Christmas
shall bring you, and the months of
spring shall bring you, critical,
skeptical, curious, sneering after
our library, questioning about our

funds, and you shall return —if
you return at all —chanting aw fer
vently and irrelevantly as we " Die
1 lift der Freiheit weht."
The following article, written by
Mrs. Ellen Coit Elliott, wife of
Registrar Elliott, is the best
recorded account of the pioneer
days during the early part of the
first year of Stanford history. It
was first published in the Cornell
Magazine of December, 1891, hav
ing been written primarily, as its
title indicated, to give news of the
''Cornell Colony at Palo Alto." It
was republished in the fourth num
ber of the Sequoia, January 20,
1392, and tonight Mrs. Elliott
read it at the decennial anniversary
exercises. Omitting the introduc
tory paragraph, which referred to
the prominence of the Cornell
colony, the article is as follows:
Mrs. Elliott's Paper.
The first arrival of the President,
the Registrar, and the professor of
chemistry, occurred so long ago
as to seem like ancient history. In
reality, it was somewhere near the
first of July, but as one looks back
ward, what a stretch intervenes.
The first of July workmen swarmed
through the buildings of the quad
rangle. The boys' dormitory was
building; the girls' dormitory
barely begun. Alvarado row, now
standing complete, with its ten pro
fessors'cottages done and occupied,
was then an unbroken stubble
field, and the plans for its houses

just being drawn. The sun was
shining placid and hot out of a
metallic blue sky, and dusty Cali
fornians were overwhelming the
new comers witli eulogies upon the
climate.
The journey from the East had
taken perhaps a week, and during
that time an astounding mail had
accumulated in the iMenlo Park
post office. Four or live hundred
letters demanded instant answers.
No offices being ready for occu
pancy, the library of the Presi
dential residence, Escondite Cot
tage, was the first work-room, and
later an upper room in a small
brick building near by was utilized.
In three weeks the Registrar's
office in the quadrangle received
the President, the Registrar, and
the stenographer, who had, mean
time, been imported from Cornell.
There toiled the vanguard, feeling,
no doubt, that L'Universite c'ext
moi. They had six roller-top desks
standing around, but nothing else
to speak of, and they were assisted
in their labors by the presence of
carpenters tinkering at drawers,
putting latches on doors, and in
terminably rubbing down the wood
work.
Events ripened fast. Ground was
broken for the cottages, the Palo
Alto road, leading to the station,
was being macadamized, concrete
pavements were being laid, the Art
Museum was growing Jike a mush
room, the dormitories approached
completion. Piano agents appeared
desiring to furnish the University
with their wares. Bookstore agents
looked over the ground with a view
to establishing branches. Land
agents busily boomed the property
about Palo Alto, one of them gen
erously offering the Registrar a per
cent, on all sales made through his
influence. A detective came down
to interview the President upon the
feasability of establishing himself
upon the campus in anticipation of
finding his services needed after
the students arrived. Teachers
from Maine to Australia were ex
pressing their willingness to he in
cluded in the magic fifteen who
were to compose the first faculty,
and students "from the kinder
garten up" were seeking admission
to " Mr. Stanford's school." All
California was looking with intense
curiosity at the modest nucleus of
the long-expected University. Some
were grumbling because a complete
preparatory system was not to be
inaugurated the first year, others
were criticising the architecture of
the buildings; many were asking,
skeptically, "Will it really open on
the first of October?" and many
were hospitably welcoming the
Easterners and rejoicing at the im
pulse the new institution had even
then begun to give to the schools of
the State.
With August the faculty began
to arrive. Events had moved too
fast for them, for having been in
formed in April that no houses for
the professors were to be put up at
present, and that they might find
accommodations in the boys' dor
mitory, they had all embraced cor
dially the notion of boarding a
year. When they were informed
in July that the plans were
changed, ten cottages would be
built, and the professors would be
expected to live in them, they for
the most part wrote back that " My
wife and I prefer to board the first
year. If we cannot go into the dor
mitory, we will establish ourselves
in Menlo Park or Mayfield."

Accordingly they sold off their
furniture, and arrived upon the
scene with the boarding notion as
firmly fixed as ever. Then it was
amusing—nay, affecting—to note
the change of attitude brought
about by contact with the "in
evitable fact." Landed at Menlo
it was found that no private family
could be induced to take boarders
011 any terms. The couple would
then perhaps explore the ranch and
peep longingly into the clustered
tents of the workmen. And finally,
after a last reassurance from the
office that, unfortunately, they
could not go into the dormitory,
they would turn toward the row,
and picking their reluctant way
over adobe, lumber and debris,
proceed to the depressing choice of
one of the ten new skeletons for
their home. Why we should all
have been so possessed with the
idea of a year's boarding might be
hard to explain, and now that we
have all been gently coerced into
the places prepared for us, there is
probably not a family which does
not rejoice to be under a roof of its
own.
About this time, when more were
coming and the cottages almost
completed, shopping trips to San
Francisco became the order of the
day. At this stage of the proceed
ings no one had a nurse-maid, so
the children had frequently to be
left in charge of their learned
fathers while the mothers took the
early train to the city. Ladies'
memorandums were an interesting
study, for, in view of the patient
gentleman nurses left behind, one
precious day must be crowded to
its utmost capacity, and the arti
cles to be purchased ranged from
parlor carpets down to clothespins
at four dozen for"a bit." October
first was almost here before the first
family took possession of its house,
and, while the stars looked in at
the curtainless windows, slept 011
the floor with a sense of vast relief
in being at last "at home."
The summer had been interest
ing, but not always easy. With
the cloudless sky always beaming
above us we perversely longed for
the patter of rain. With palms
and cacti galore our souls yearned
after grass. With the most perfect
dust in existence powdered white
over the vegetation, we unreason
ably missed our mud. With thirteen
flourishing saloons to comfort us
and the three hundred other inhab
itants of Menlo Park, we still
thought regretfully of some trim
little elm-shadowed villages of the
East. For those who came early
the waiting was long. So long we
watched the workmen hammering
away under the arcades, and won
dered if ever the long aisles would
resound with more scholastic
echoes. So long we endured the
stuffy rooms and lamentable food
of our boarding-places. So long
the half-dozen gentlemen walked
daily through the beating sun the
two dusty miles to Menlo Park and
earned by this defiance of Califor
nia custom the sobriquet of "tramp
professors." They carried their
lunches in little baskets, and when
noon came it was truly interesting
to behold this embryonic faculty
eating its dinner. They sat in a
picturesque row under the arches,
resting themselves upon the low
stone wall bounding the arcade.
The lunches were dreadful aggre
gations and quite inadequate in
quantity besides. And these poor
scholars, founders of a great uni
versity, were said to look with envy
upon the stenographer who bad a
phenomenal landlady and brought
large pieces of frosted cake, and to
cast surreptitious glances toward
the basket of the President, who
brought his dinner from his own
menage and ate it contentedly at
the point of the jack-knife.
The Professor from Boston used
to flee to the city every day or so,
ostensibly on business, but in real
ity—as he confessed when the libra
rian charged him with it —" to get
a cup of coffee." This practice
nearly got him into trouble, for
presently, among the bills for uni
versity material sent from the city
office to the office of the President for
auditing, there came one from a city
restaurant bearing the simple leg
end: "Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, Dr.: To one terrapin stew,
$1.25."
Suspicion at once fastened upon
the man who went to the city for cof
fee, and it was only with difficulty
that he was able to clear himself of
the charge of carousing upon terra
pin stew at the University's ex
pense.
So the summer passed away,
and enthusiasts though they were,
there might have been in the heart
of each one sometime a secret
thought fitly expressed in a brief
dialogue I overheard one day. Two
were standing on the hotel porch
at twilight watching the train across
the road getting ready to start for
San Francisco. Said one, deject
edly, "Let's get on board and go
home," and the other answered
with alacrity, "Any moment you
please."
But when September arrived and
the rest of the faculty began to
come in rapidly; when the build
ings of the quadrangle one by one
grew silent and completed; when
registration day approached and
all work rushed forward to the be
ginning of the term, such excresent
regret as there was died forgotten
and all interest centered on the
coming opening.
The people of the State were at
last convinced that the University
intended to begin in earnest on the
Ist of October, and they came in
force to attend the exercises of that
day. Some one reported that " in
the early morning the streets of
San .Jose and Santa Clara were
alive with vehicles carrying people
to Palo Alto," and, although this
has a slightly mythical sound, it is
certain that long before the time
for beginning the audience was
gathering upon "the ranch." The
horses were tied wherever there was
place round about and the visitors
pressed into the quadrangle and
took up the seats. Trains ran up
to the buildings on the switch used
to bring freight from the railroad,
and unloaded guests on the spot.
By half-past ten, when the exer
cises commenced, the "great,
bright quadrangle contained some
thing over an acre of humanity,"
if I may be permitted the expres
sion. The seats in front of the
platform were full, back of them
hundreds stood up, and those who
could find no place within earshot
promenaded the arcades and talked.
• The sky was at its bluest, and
the red tile of the low continuous
roofs glowed against it with a soft
brilliance. Again, below the buff
stone, the shadowed arcades, the
eight banks of greenest foliage
rising from the quadrangle floor,
the gay flags and flowers decorating
three entrances, and on the fourth

side the entrance arch transformed
into an embowered alcove about
the speakers' platform; the golden
California sunshine glinting radi
antly over the whole. To right and
left of the platform pampas plumes
and palms sprang lifteen feet up
into the light. Lower down pal
mettos and delicate bamboo sprays
encircled the edge and were them
selves encircled by long festoons of
grapes banging in gigantic clusters
entirely across. The Stars and
Stripes fell in rich folds at the sides
of the alcove. Overhead fluttered
banners, while a fringe of drooping
eucalyptus seemed to supply the
one tender minor note in the tri
umphant decorative harmony, turn
ing our eyes and thoughts to the
portrait of the boy, Leland Stan
lord, which looked down upon us
with so serious eyes from the
alcove's background.
When Mr. and Mrs. Stanford ap
peared, the University slogan was
for the first time heard. Some four
hundred students were present,
seated together near the platform,
and at this moment, after three
cheers, they gave down very credit
ably and with immense enthusi
asm, " Wahoo! Wahoo! L. S. J.
U!. Stanford!" Then we felt that
the University was born. The re
porters, "seated in a body in the
little pen under the platform's
edge, have given to the world a
sufficiently detailed account of the
exercises. The cameras perched
pracariously upon the roofs or
mounted on stilts in the midst of
the audience, have revealed to a
continent the fact that the repre
sentative of the Board of Trustees
made his address under the shadow
of a parasol held by the President;
while the President, when bespoke,
was in turn protected by the pro
fessor of mathematics. Has the
public also been told that when the
proceedings were over and the fav
ored guests had gone to lunch at
the Stanford residence, the crowd
sat down in the cool arcades to eat
its lunch, and for dessert appro
priated the decorative grapes from
the deserted rostrum?
Four hundred students, both dor
mitories full, Alvarado row almost
settled, classroom work begun —so
it looked the Monday after opening
day. Four hundred and seventy
live is the number at present. They
have had their first disturbance at
Encina Hull, with an expulsion or
so following, and settled down to
work.
The month between has been busy
and progressive. The boys'gymnas
ium has gone up, more professors'
houses are begun, and Alvarado
row has its sidewalk. With the
unexpected number of students the
President has renewed his con
genial activity in the matter of ap
pointing new instructors. We have
begun to make our newspaper rep
utation. Out of their own rich ex
perience, Cornel lians will sym

edly, "Let's get on board and go
home," and the other answered
with alacrity, "Any moment you
please."
But when September arrived and
the rest of the faculty began to
come in rapidly; when the build
ings of the quadrangle one by one
grew silent and completed; when
registration day approached and
all work rushed forward to the be
ginning of the term, such excresent
regret as there was died forgotten
and all interest centered on the
coming opening.
The people of the State were at
last convinced that the University
intended to begin in earnest on the
Ist of October, and they came in
force to attend the exercises of that
day. Some one reported that " in
the early morning the streets of
San .Jose and Santa Clara were
alive with vehicles carrying people
to Palo Alto," and, although this
has a slightly mythical sound, it is
certain that long before the time
for beginning the audience was
gathering upon "the ranch." The
horses were tied wherever there was
place round about and the visitors
pressed into the quadrangle and
took up the seats. Trains ran up
to the buildings on the switch used
to bring freight from the railroad,
and unloaded guests on the spot.
By half-past ten, when the exer
cises commenced, the "great,
bright quadrangle contained some
thing over an acre of humanity,"
if I may be permitted the expres
sion. The seats in front of the
platform were full, back of them
hundreds stood up, and those who
could find no place within earshot
promenaded the arcades and talked.
• The sky was at its bluest, and
the red tile of the low continuous
roofs glowed against it with a soft
brilliance. Again, below the buff
stone, the shadowed arcades, the
eight banks of greenest foliage
rising from the quadrangle floor,
the gay flags and flowers decorating
three entrances, and on the fourth

side the entrance arch transformed
into an embowered alcove about
the speakers' platform; the golden
California sunshine glinting radi
antly over the whole. To right and
left of the platform pampas plumes
and palms sprang lifteen feet up
into the light. Lower down pal
mettos and delicate bamboo sprays
encircled the edge and were them
selves encircled by long festoons of
grapes banging in gigantic clusters
entirely across. The Stars and
Stripes fell in rich folds at the sides
of the alcove. Overhead fluttered
banners, while a fringe of drooping
eucalyptus seemed to supply the
one tender minor note in the tri
umphant decorative harmony, turn
ing our eyes and thoughts to the
portrait of the boy, Leland Stan
lord, which looked down upon us
with so serious eyes from the
alcove's background.
When Mr. and Mrs. Stanford ap
peared, the University slogan was
for the first time heard. Some four
hundred students were present,
seated together near the platform,
and at this moment, after three
cheers, they gave down very credit
ably and with immense enthusi
asm, " Wahoo! Wahoo! L. S. J.
U!. Stanford!" Then we felt that
the University was born. The re
porters, "seated in a body in the
little pen under the platform's
edge, have given to the world a
sufficiently detailed account of the
exercises. The cameras perched
pracariously upon the roofs or
mounted on stilts in the midst of
the audience, have revealed to a
continent the fact that the repre
sentative of the Board of Trustees
made his address under the shadow
of a parasol held by the President;
while the President, when bespoke,
was in turn protected by the pro
fessor of mathematics. Has the
public also been told that when the
proceedings were over and the fav
ored guests had gone to lunch at
the Stanford residence, the crowd
sat down in the cool arcades to eat
its lunch, and for dessert appro
priated the decorative grapes from
the deserted rostrum?
Four hundred students, both dor
mitories full, Alvarado row almost
settled, classroom work begun —so
it looked the Monday after opening
day. Four hundred and seventy
live is the number at present. They
have had their first disturbance at
Encina Hull, with an expulsion or
so following, and settled down to
work.
The month between has been busy
and progressive. The boys'gymnas
ium has gone up, more professors'
houses are begun, and Alvarado
row has its sidewalk. With the
unexpected number of students the
President has renewed his con
genial activity in the matter of ap
pointing new instructors. We have
begun to make our newspaper rep
utation. Out of their own rich ex
perience, Cornel lians will sym
pathize with our dismay when we
discovered, taking its unhindered
march through the press, the
amazing statement that "Senator
Stanford claimed the right to expel
students who do not behave as he
thinks they should do, and that
200 boys were recently saved from
expulsion only by the intercession
of Mrs. Stanford with the infuri
ated old man." When a Western
journal takes the trouble to fabri
cate, it spares no pains to place its
produce at the top. The fine and
generous amplitude of the "200
students," and the exquisite in

appropriateness of the wild and
wooly adjective applied to the
gentlest of men, could hardly be
equalled in the effete East, and
mark the fiction as an indigenous
growth of our adopted soil.
The quadrangle is busy now with
its proper activity. Classrooms are
full to overflowing; and when the
triangle suspended in the archway
jangles musically the signal for
change, the passing of the students
fills the colonnades with a stream
of life and motion. Between hours
a studious silence reigns, gently
broken by the murmur of the lec
turer's voice as it sounds through
the open window. A student or two
crossing the court, a group or two
studying under the arcade's airy
shelter, accent the scholastic intent.
Back and forth from Palo Alto
station lumbers Paulsen's mam
moth omnibus, characteristically
built to hold forty passengers, and
with it runs a smaller vehicle, fun
nily labeled "Stanford's Univer
sity." Back and forth from the
station, morning and night, from
San Jose, from Santa Clara, from
lied wood, from San Francisco
even, come and go non-resident
students.
It would be no wonder if the
rumor were true that Alvarado row
has been dubbed by the students
"The Decalogue," for up out of the
stubbletield rises this row of ten, as
yet unsoftened by lawn or shrub or
tree, and presenting to Encina, at
the other edge of the stubble, a
front of uncompromising rectitude,
perhaps sufficiently suggestive of
the moral law. At meal time, from
one end of the row to the other, the
various professors may be seen to
issue from their various houses
bearing pails —wooden pails, gran
ite-ware pails, tin milk-pails, any
kind of pails —and wending their
way to the huge, unsightly water
tank which stores the precious yield
of an artesian well near one end of
the row. About the same time if
you look out of your backdoor, you
will see various of the faculty
ladies picking up chips to start the
fire with, or even gathering in
wood from the huge wood-piles.
One day we beheld the professor of
pedagogy striding across the open
toward May held, and presently
back he strode again, bearing in his
hand a vermilion buck-saw, and
was soon thereafter decried attack
ing his wood-pile with all his char
acteristic energy. All this pending
the advent of servants and consid
erations of propriety. Pending the
advent of the electric light, the
flicker of the tallow dip was for
some days the only light shed upon
the student page at Roble and En
cina. The candle is still in vogue
in the row, and as electricity is ex
pected at any moment, a redwood
block or a bottle serves every pur
pose for holding the primitive
taper.
Perhaps it is the spirit of the
West, perhaps it is the vital breath
of the Pacificcoming into us over the
mountains, but whatever it may
be, some enchantment, has blinded
us to the crudities, the drawbacks,
the limitations of our state. The
giants looming in the path of the
pioneer appear but frivolous wind
mills in our eyes. Come not out to us,
oh, doubting Cornellians, thinking
to return untouched by the unrea
sonable enthusiasm. Christmas
shall bring you, and the months of
spring shall bring you, critical,
skeptical, curious, sneering after
our library, questioning about our

funds, and you shall return —if
you return at all —chanting aw fer
vently and irrelevantly as we " Die
1 lift der Freiheit weht."
The following article, written by
Mrs. Ellen Coit Elliott, wife of
Registrar Elliott, is the best
recorded account of the pioneer
days during the early part of the
first year of Stanford history. It
was first published in the Cornell
Magazine of December, 1891, hav
ing been written primarily, as its
title indicated, to give news of the
''Cornell Colony at Palo Alto." It
was republished in the fourth num
ber of the Sequoia, January 20,
1392, and tonight Mrs. Elliott
read it at the decennial anniversary
exercises. Omitting the introduc
tory paragraph, which referred to
the prominence of the Cornell
colony, the article is as follows:
Mrs. Elliott's Paper.
The first arrival of the President,
the Registrar, and the professor of
chemistry, occurred so long ago
as to seem like ancient history. In
reality, it was somewhere near the
first of July, but as one looks back
ward, what a stretch intervenes.
The first of July workmen swarmed
through the buildings of the quad
rangle. The boys' dormitory was
building; the girls' dormitory
barely begun. Alvarado row, now
standing complete, with its ten pro
fessors'cottages done and occupied,
was then an unbroken stubble
field, and the plans for its houses

just being drawn. The sun was
shining placid and hot out of a
metallic blue sky, and dusty Cali
fornians were overwhelming the
new comers witli eulogies upon the
climate.
The journey from the East had
taken perhaps a week, and during
that time an astounding mail had
accumulated in the iMenlo Park
post office. Four or live hundred
letters demanded instant answers.
No offices being ready for occu
pancy, the library of the Presi
dential residence, Escondite Cot
tage, was the first work-room, and
later an upper room in a small
brick building near by was utilized.
In three weeks the Registrar's
office in the quadrangle received
the President, the Registrar, and
the stenographer, who had, mean
time, been imported from Cornell.
There toiled the vanguard, feeling,
no doubt, that L'Universite c'ext
moi. They had six roller-top desks
standing around, but nothing else
to speak of, and they were assisted
in their labors by the presence of
carpenters tinkering at drawers,
putting latches on doors, and in
terminably rubbing down the wood
work.
Events ripened fast. Ground was
broken for the cottages, the Palo
Alto road, leading to the station,
was being macadamized, concrete
pavements were being laid, the Art
Museum was growing Jike a mush
room, the dormitories approached
completion. Piano agents appeared
desiring to furnish the University
with their wares. Bookstore agents
looked over the ground with a view
to establishing branches. Land
agents busily boomed the property
about Palo Alto, one of them gen
erously offering the Registrar a per
cent, on all sales made through his
influence. A detective came down
to interview the President upon the
feasability of establishing himself
upon the campus in anticipation of
finding his services needed after
the students arrived. Teachers
from Maine to Australia were ex
pressing their willingness to he in
cluded in the magic fifteen who
were to compose the first faculty,
and students "from the kinder
garten up" were seeking admission
to " Mr. Stanford's school." All
California was looking with intense
curiosity at the modest nucleus of
the long-expected University. Some
were grumbling because a complete
preparatory system was not to be
inaugurated the first year, others
were criticising the architecture of
the buildings; many were asking,
skeptically, "Will it really open on
the first of October?" and many
were hospitably welcoming the
Easterners and rejoicing at the im
pulse the new institution had even
then begun to give to the schools of
the State.
With August the faculty began
to arrive. Events had moved too
fast for them, for having been in
formed in April that no houses for
the professors were to be put up at
present, and that they might find
accommodations in the boys' dor
mitory, they had all embraced cor
dially the notion of boarding a
year. When they were informed
in July that the plans were
changed, ten cottages would be
built, and the professors would be
expected to live in them, they for
the most part wrote back that " My
wife and I prefer to board the first
year. If we cannot go into the dor
mitory, we will establish ourselves
in Menlo Park or Mayfield."

Accordingly they sold off their
furniture, and arrived upon the
scene with the boarding notion as
firmly fixed as ever. Then it was
amusing—nay, affecting—to note
the change of attitude brought
about by contact with the "in
evitable fact." Landed at Menlo
it was found that no private family
could be induced to take boarders
011 any terms. The couple would
then perhaps explore the ranch and
peep longingly into the clustered
tents of the workmen. And finally,
after a last reassurance from the
office that, unfortunately, they
could not go into the dormitory,
they would turn toward the row,
and picking their reluctant way
over adobe, lumber and debris,
proceed to the depressing choice of
one of the ten new skeletons for
their home. Why we should all
have been so possessed with the
idea of a year's boarding might be
hard to explain, and now that we
have all been gently coerced into
the places prepared for us, there is
probably not a family which does
not rejoice to be under a roof of its
own.
About this time, when more were
coming and the cottages almost
completed, shopping trips to San
Francisco became the order of the
day. At this stage of the proceed
ings no one had a nurse-maid, so
the children had frequently to be
left in charge of their learned
fathers while the mothers took the
early train to the city. Ladies'
memorandums were an interesting
study, for, in view of the patient
gentleman nurses left behind, one
precious day must be crowded to
its utmost capacity, and the arti
cles to be purchased ranged from
parlor carpets down to clothespins
at four dozen for"a bit." October
first was almost here before the first
family took possession of its house,
and, while the stars looked in at
the curtainless windows, slept 011
the floor with a sense of vast relief
in being at last "at home."
The summer had been interest
ing, but not always easy. With
the cloudless sky always beaming
above us we perversely longed for
the patter of rain. With palms
and cacti galore our souls yearned
after grass. With the most perfect
dust in existence powdered white
over the vegetation, we unreason
ably missed our mud. With thirteen
flourishing saloons to comfort us
and the three hundred other inhab
itants of Menlo Park, we still
thought regretfully of some trim
little elm-shadowed villages of the
East. For those who came early
the waiting was long. So long we
watched the workmen hammering
away under the arcades, and won
dered if ever the long aisles would
resound with more scholastic
echoes. So long we endured the
stuffy rooms and lamentable food
of our boarding-places. So long
the half-dozen gentlemen walked
daily through the beating sun the
two dusty miles to Menlo Park and
earned by this defiance of Califor
nia custom the sobriquet of "tramp
professors." They carried their
lunches in little baskets, and when
noon came it was truly interesting
to behold this embryonic faculty
eating its dinner. They sat in a
picturesque row under the arches,
resting themselves upon the low
stone wall bounding the arcade.
The lunches were dreadful aggre
gations and quite inadequate in
quantity besides. And these poor
scholars, founders of a great uni
versity, were said to look with envy
upon the stenographer who bad a
phenomenal landlady and brought
large pieces of frosted cake, and to
cast surreptitious glances toward
the basket of the President, who
brought his dinner from his own
menage and ate it contentedly at
the point of the jack-knife.
The Professor from Boston used
to flee to the city every day or so,
ostensibly on business, but in real
ity—as he confessed when the libra
rian charged him with it —" to get
a cup of coffee." This practice
nearly got him into trouble, for
presently, among the bills for uni
versity material sent from the city
office to the office of the President for
auditing, there came one from a city
restaurant bearing the simple leg
end: "Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, Dr.: To one terrapin stew,
$1.25."
Suspicion at once fastened upon
the man who went to the city for cof
fee, and it was only with difficulty
that he was able to clear himself of
the charge of carousing upon terra
pin stew at the University's ex
pense.
So the summer passed away,
and enthusiasts though they were,
there might have been in the heart
of each one sometime a secret
thought fitly expressed in a brief
dialogue I overheard one day. Two
were standing on the hotel porch
at twilight watching the train across
the road getting ready to start for
San Francisco. Said one, deject
edly, "Let's get on board and go
home," and the other answered
with alacrity, "Any moment you
please."
But when September arrived and
the rest of the faculty began to

ings of the quadrangle one by one

registration day approached and
all work rushed forward to the be

could be induced to take boarders
011 any terms. The couple would
then perhaps explore the ranch and
peep longingly into the clustered
tents of the workmen. And finally,
after a last reassurance from the
office that, unfortunately, they
could not go into the dormitory,
they would turn toward the row,
and picking their reluctant way
over adobe, lumber and debris,
proceed to the depressing choice of
one of the ten new skeletons for
their home. Why we should all
have been so possessed with the
idea of a year's boarding might be
hard to explain, and now that we
have all been gently coerced into
the places prepared for us, there is
probably not a family which does
not rejoice to be under a roof of its
own.
About this time, when more were
coming and the cottages almost
completed, shopping trips to San
Francisco became the order of the
day. At this stage of the proceed
ings no one had a nurse-maid, so
the children had frequently to be
left in charge of their learned
fathers while the mothers took the
early train to the city. Ladies'
memorandums were an interesting
study, for, in view of the patient
gentleman nurses left behind, one
precious day must be crowded to
its utmost capacity, and the arti
cles to be purchased ranged from
parlor carpets down to clothespins
at four dozen for"a bit." October
first was almost here before the first
family took possession of its house,
and, while the stars looked in at
the curtainless windows, slept 011
the floor with a sense of vast relief
in being at last "at home."
The summer had been interest
ing, but not always easy. With
the cloudless sky always beaming
above us we perversely longed for
the patter of rain. With palms
and cacti galore our souls yearned
after grass. With the most perfect
dust in existence powdered white
over the vegetation, we unreason
ably missed our mud. With thirteen
flourishing saloons to comfort us
and the three hundred other inhab
itants of Menlo Park, we still
thought regretfully of some trim
little elm-shadowed villages of the
East. For those who came early
the waiting was long. So long we
watched the workmen hammering
away under the arcades, and won
dered if ever the long aisles would
resound with more scholastic
echoes. So long we endured the
stuffy rooms and lamentable food
of our boarding-places. So long
the half-dozen gentlemen walked
daily through the beating sun the
two dusty miles to Menlo Park and
earned by this defiance of Califor
nia custom the sobriquet of "tramp
professors." They carried their
lunches in little baskets, and when
noon came it was truly interesting
to behold this embryonic faculty
eating its dinner. They sat in a
picturesque row under the arches,
resting themselves upon the low
stone wall bounding the arcade.
The lunches were dreadful aggre
gations and quite inadequate in
quantity besides. And these poor
scholars, founders of a great uni
versity, were said to look with envy
upon the stenographer who bad a
phenomenal landlady and brought
large pieces of frosted cake, and to
cast surreptitious glances toward
the basket of the President, who
brought his dinner from his own
menage and ate it contentedly at
the point of the jack-knife.
The Professor from Boston used
to flee to the city every day or so,
ostensibly on business, but in real
ity—as he confessed when the libra
rian charged him with it —" to get
a cup of coffee." This practice
nearly got him into trouble, for
presently, among the bills for uni
versity material sent from the city
office to the office of the President for
auditing, there came one from a city
restaurant bearing the simple leg
end: "Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, Dr.: To one terrapin stew,
$1.25."
Suspicion at once fastened upon
the man who went to the city for cof
fee, and it was only with difficulty
that he was able to clear himself of
the charge of carousing upon terra
pin stew at the University's ex
pense.
So the summer passed away,
and enthusiasts though they were,
there might have been in the heart
of each one sometime a secret
thought fitly expressed in a brief
dialogue I overheard one day. Two
were standing on the hotel porch
at twilight watching the train across
the road getting ready to start for
San Francisco. Said one, deject
edly, "Let's get on board and go
home," and the other answered
with alacrity, "Any moment you
please."
But when September arrived and
the rest of the faculty began to
come in rapidly; when the build
ings of the quadrangle one by one
grew silent and completed; when
registration day approached and
all work rushed forward to the be
ginning of the term, such excresent
regret as there was died forgotten
and all interest centered on the
coming opening.
The people of the State were at
last convinced that the University
intended to begin in earnest on the
Ist of October, and they came in
force to attend the exercises of that
day. Some one reported that " in
the early morning the streets of
San .Jose and Santa Clara were
alive with vehicles carrying people
to Palo Alto," and, although this
has a slightly mythical sound, it is
certain that long before the time
for beginning the audience was
gathering upon "the ranch." The
horses were tied wherever there was
place round about and the visitors
pressed into the quadrangle and
took up the seats. Trains ran up
to the buildings on the switch used
to bring freight from the railroad,
and unloaded guests on the spot.
By half-past ten, when the exer
cises commenced, the "great,
bright quadrangle contained some
thing over an acre of humanity,"
if I may be permitted the expres
sion. The seats in front of the
platform were full, back of them
hundreds stood up, and those who
could find no place within earshot
promenaded the arcades and talked.
• The sky was at its bluest, and
the red tile of the low continuous
roofs glowed against it with a soft
brilliance. Again, below the buff
stone, the shadowed arcades, the
eight banks of greenest foliage
rising from the quadrangle floor,
the gay flags and flowers decorating
three entrances, and on the fourth

side the entrance arch transformed
into an embowered alcove about
the speakers' platform; the golden
California sunshine glinting radi
antly over the whole. To right and
left of the platform pampas plumes
and palms sprang lifteen feet up
into the light. Lower down pal
mettos and delicate bamboo sprays
encircled the edge and were them
selves encircled by long festoons of
grapes banging in gigantic clusters
entirely across. The Stars and
Stripes fell in rich folds at the sides
of the alcove. Overhead fluttered
banners, while a fringe of drooping
eucalyptus seemed to supply the
one tender minor note in the tri
umphant decorative harmony, turn
ing our eyes and thoughts to the
portrait of the boy, Leland Stan
lord, which looked down upon us
with so serious eyes from the
alcove's background.
When Mr. and Mrs. Stanford ap
peared, the University slogan was
for the first time heard. Some four
hundred students were present,
seated together near the platform,
and at this moment, after three
cheers, they gave down very credit
ably and with immense enthusi
asm, " Wahoo! Wahoo! L. S. J.
U!. Stanford!" Then we felt that
the University was born. The re
porters, "seated in a body in the
little pen under the platform's
edge, have given to the world a
sufficiently detailed account of the
exercises. The cameras perched
pracariously upon the roofs or
mounted on stilts in the midst of
the audience, have revealed to a
continent the fact that the repre
sentative of the Board of Trustees
made his address under the shadow
of a parasol held by the President;
while the President, when bespoke,
was in turn protected by the pro
fessor of mathematics. Has the
public also been told that when the
proceedings were over and the fav
ored guests had gone to lunch at
the Stanford residence, the crowd
sat down in the cool arcades to eat
its lunch, and for dessert appro
priated the decorative grapes from
the deserted rostrum?
Four hundred students, both dor
mitories full, Alvarado row almost
settled, classroom work begun —so
it looked the Monday after opening
day. Four hundred and seventy
live is the number at present. They
have had their first disturbance at
Encina Hull, with an expulsion or
so following, and settled down to
work.
The month between has been busy
and progressive. The boys'gymnas
ium has gone up, more professors'
houses are begun, and Alvarado
row has its sidewalk. With the
unexpected number of students the
President has renewed his con
genial activity in the matter of ap
pointing new instructors. We have
begun to make our newspaper rep
utation. Out of their own rich ex
perience, Cornel lians will sym
pathize with our dismay when we
discovered, taking its unhindered
march through the press, the
amazing statement that "Senator
Stanford claimed the right to expel
students who do not behave as he
thinks they should do, and that
200 boys were recently saved from
expulsion only by the intercession
of Mrs. Stanford with the infuri
ated old man." When a Western
journal takes the trouble to fabri
cate, it spares no pains to place its
produce at the top. The fine and
generous amplitude of the "200
students," and the exquisite in

appropriateness of the wild and
wooly adjective applied to the
gentlest of men, could hardly be
equalled in the effete East, and
mark the fiction as an indigenous
growth of our adopted soil.
The quadrangle is busy now with
its proper activity. Classrooms are
full to overflowing; and when the
triangle suspended in the archway
jangles musically the signal for
change, the passing of the students
fills the colonnades with a stream
of life and motion. Between hours
a studious silence reigns, gently
broken by the murmur of the lec
turer's voice as it sounds through
the open window. A student or two
crossing the court, a group or two
studying under the arcade's airy
shelter, accent the scholastic intent.
Back and forth from Palo Alto
station lumbers Paulsen's mam
moth omnibus, characteristically
built to hold forty passengers, and
with it runs a smaller vehicle, fun
nily labeled "Stanford's Univer
sity." Back and forth from the
station, morning and night, from
San Jose, from Santa Clara, from
lied wood, from San Francisco
even, come and go non-resident
students.
It would be no wonder if the
rumor were true that Alvarado row
has been dubbed by the students
"The Decalogue," for up out of the
stubbletield rises this row of ten, as
yet unsoftened by lawn or shrub or
tree, and presenting to Encina, at
the other edge of the stubble, a
front of uncompromising rectitude,
perhaps sufficiently suggestive of
the moral law. At meal time, from
one end of the row to the other, the
various professors may be seen to
issue from their various houses
bearing pails —wooden pails, gran
ite-ware pails, tin milk-pails, any
kind of pails —and wending their
way to the huge, unsightly water
tank which stores the precious yield
of an artesian well near one end of
the row. About the same time if
you look out of your backdoor, you
will see various of the faculty
ladies picking up chips to start the
fire with, or even gathering in
wood from the huge wood-piles.
One day we beheld the professor of
pedagogy striding across the open
toward May held, and presently
back he strode again, bearing in his
hand a vermilion buck-saw, and
was soon thereafter decried attack
ing his wood-pile with all his char
acteristic energy. All this pending
the advent of servants and consid
erations of propriety. Pending the
advent of the electric light, the
flicker of the tallow dip was for
some days the only light shed upon
the student page at Roble and En
cina. The candle is still in vogue
in the row, and as electricity is ex
pected at any moment, a redwood
block or a bottle serves every pur
pose for holding the primitive
taper.
Perhaps it is the spirit of the
West, perhaps it is the vital breath
of the Pacificcoming into us over the
mountains, but whatever it may
be, some enchantment, has blinded
us to the crudities, the drawbacks,
the limitations of our state. The
giants looming in the path of the
pioneer appear but frivolous wind
mills in our eyes. Come not out to us,
oh, doubting Cornellians, thinking
to return untouched by the unrea
sonable enthusiasm. Christmas
shall bring you, and the months of
spring shall bring you, critical,
skeptical, curious, sneering after
our library, questioning about our

funds, and you shall return —if
you return at all —chanting aw fer
vently and irrelevantly as we " Die
1 lift der Freiheit weht."
The following article, written by
Mrs. Ellen Coit Elliott, wife of
Registrar Elliott, is the best
recorded account of the pioneer
days during the early part of the
first year of Stanford history. It
was first published in the Cornell
Magazine of December, 1891, hav
ing been written primarily, as its
title indicated, to give news of the
''Cornell Colony at Palo Alto." It
was republished in the fourth num
ber of the Sequoia, January 20,
1392, and tonight Mrs. Elliott
read it at the decennial anniversary
exercises. Omitting the introduc
tory paragraph, which referred to
the prominence of the Cornell
colony, the article is as follows:
Mrs. Elliott's Paper.
The first arrival of the President,
the Registrar, and the professor of
chemistry, occurred so long ago
as to seem like ancient history. In
reality, it was somewhere near the
first of July, but as one looks back
ward, what a stretch intervenes.
The first of July workmen swarmed
through the buildings of the quad
rangle. The boys' dormitory was
building; the girls' dormitory
barely begun. Alvarado row, now
standing complete, with its ten pro
fessors'cottages done and occupied,
was then an unbroken stubble
field, and the plans for its houses

just being drawn. The sun was
shining placid and hot out of a
metallic blue sky, and dusty Cali
fornians were overwhelming the
new comers witli eulogies upon the
climate.
The journey from the East had
taken perhaps a week, and during
that time an astounding mail had
accumulated in the iMenlo Park
post office. Four or live hundred
letters demanded instant answers.
No offices being ready for occu
pancy, the library of the Presi
dential residence, Escondite Cot
tage, was the first work-room, and
later an upper room in a small
brick building near by was utilized.
In three weeks the Registrar's
office in the quadrangle received
the President, the Registrar, and
the stenographer, who had, mean
time, been imported from Cornell.
There toiled the vanguard, feeling,
no doubt, that L'Universite c'ext
moi. They had six roller-top desks
standing around, but nothing else
to speak of, and they were assisted
in their labors by the presence of
carpenters tinkering at drawers,
putting latches on doors, and in
terminably rubbing down the wood
work.
Events ripened fast. Ground was
broken for the cottages, the Palo
Alto road, leading to the station,
was being macadamized, concrete
pavements were being laid, the Art
Museum was growing Jike a mush
room, the dormitories approached
completion. Piano agents appeared
desiring to furnish the University
with their wares. Bookstore agents
looked over the ground with a view
to establishing branches. Land
agents busily boomed the property
about Palo Alto, one of them gen
erously offering the Registrar a per
cent, on all sales made through his
influence. A detective came down
to interview the President upon the
feasability of establishing himself
upon the campus in anticipation of
finding his services needed after
the students arrived. Teachers
from Maine to Australia were ex
pressing their willingness to he in
cluded in the magic fifteen who
were to compose the first faculty,
and students "from the kinder
garten up" were seeking admission
to " Mr. Stanford's school." All
California was looking with intense
curiosity at the modest nucleus of
the long-expected University. Some
were grumbling because a complete
preparatory system was not to be
inaugurated the first year, others
were criticising the architecture of
the buildings; many were asking,
skeptically, "Will it really open on
the first of October?" and many
were hospitably welcoming the
Easterners and rejoicing at the im
pulse the new institution had even
then begun to give to the schools of
the State.
With August the faculty began
to arrive. Events had moved too
fast for them, for having been in
formed in April that no houses for
the professors were to be put up at
present, and that they might find
accommodations in the boys' dor
mitory, they had all embraced cor
dially the notion of boarding a
year. When they were informed
in July that the plans were
changed, ten cottages would be
built, and the professors would be
expected to live in them, they for
the most part wrote back that " My
wife and I prefer to board the first
year. If we cannot go into the dor
mitory, we will establish ourselves
in Menlo Park or Mayfield."

Accordingly they sold off their
furniture, and arrived upon the
scene with the boarding notion as
firmly fixed as ever. Then it was
amusing—nay, affecting—to note
the change of attitude brought
about by contact with the "in
evitable fact." Landed at Menlo
it was found that no private family
could be induced to take boarders
011 any terms. The couple would
then perhaps explore the ranch and
peep longingly into the clustered
tents of the workmen. And finally,
after a last reassurance from the
office that, unfortunately, they
could not go into the dormitory,
they would turn toward the row,
and picking their reluctant way
over adobe, lumber and debris,
proceed to the depressing choice of
one of the ten new skeletons for
their home. Why we should all
have been so possessed with the
idea of a year's boarding might be
hard to explain, and now that we
have all been gently coerced into
the places prepared for us, there is
probably not a family which does
not rejoice to be under a roof of its

ber of the Sequoia, January 20,
1392, and tonight Mrs. Elliott
read it at the decennial anniversary
exercises. Omitting the introduc
tory paragraph, which referred to
the prominence of the Cornell
colony, the article is as follows:
Mrs. Elliott's Paper.
The first arrival of the President,
the Registrar, and the professor of
chemistry, occurred so long ago
as to seem like ancient history. In
reality, it was somewhere near the
first of July, but as one looks back
ward, what a stretch intervenes.
The first of July workmen swarmed
through the buildings of the quad
rangle. The boys' dormitory was
building; the girls' dormitory
barely begun. Alvarado row, now
standing complete, with its ten pro
fessors'cottages done and occupied,
was then an unbroken stubble
field, and the plans for its houses

just being drawn. The sun was
shining placid and hot out of a
metallic blue sky, and dusty Cali
fornians were overwhelming the
new comers witli eulogies upon the
climate.
The journey from the East had
taken perhaps a week, and during
that time an astounding mail had
accumulated in the iMenlo Park
post office. Four or live hundred
letters demanded instant answers.
No offices being ready for occu
pancy, the library of the Presi
dential residence, Escondite Cot
tage, was the first work-room, and
later an upper room in a small
brick building near by was utilized.
In three weeks the Registrar's
office in the quadrangle received
the President, the Registrar, and
the stenographer, who had, mean
time, been imported from Cornell.
There toiled the vanguard, feeling,
no doubt, that L'Universite c'ext
moi. They had six roller-top desks
standing around, but nothing else
to speak of, and they were assisted
in their labors by the presence of
carpenters tinkering at drawers,
putting latches on doors, and in
terminably rubbing down the wood
work.
Events ripened fast. Ground was
broken for the cottages, the Palo
Alto road, leading to the station,
was being macadamized, concrete
pavements were being laid, the Art
Museum was growing Jike a mush
room, the dormitories approached
completion. Piano agents appeared
desiring to furnish the University
with their wares. Bookstore agents
looked over the ground with a view
to establishing branches. Land
agents busily boomed the property
about Palo Alto, one of them gen
erously offering the Registrar a per
cent, on all sales made through his
influence. A detective came down
to interview the President upon the
feasability of establishing himself
upon the campus in anticipation of
finding his services needed after
the students arrived. Teachers
from Maine to Australia were ex
pressing their willingness to he in
cluded in the magic fifteen who
were to compose the first faculty,
and students "from the kinder
garten up" were seeking admission
to " Mr. Stanford's school." All
California was looking with intense
curiosity at the modest nucleus of
the long-expected University. Some
were grumbling because a complete
preparatory system was not to be
inaugurated the first year, others
were criticising the architecture of
the buildings; many were asking,
skeptically, "Will it really open on
the first of October?" and many
were hospitably welcoming the
Easterners and rejoicing at the im
pulse the new institution had even
then begun to give to the schools of
the State.
With August the faculty began
to arrive. Events had moved too
fast for them, for having been in
formed in April that no houses for
the professors were to be put up at
present, and that they might find
accommodations in the boys' dor
mitory, they had all embraced cor
dially the notion of boarding a
year. When they were informed
in July that the plans were
changed, ten cottages would be
built, and the professors would be
expected to live in them, they for
the most part wrote back that " My
wife and I prefer to board the first
year. If we cannot go into the dor
mitory, we will establish ourselves
in Menlo Park or Mayfield."

Accordingly they sold off their
furniture, and arrived upon the
scene with the boarding notion as
firmly fixed as ever. Then it was
amusing—nay, affecting—to note
the change of attitude brought
about by contact with the "in
evitable fact." Landed at Menlo
it was found that no private family
could be induced to take boarders
011 any terms. The couple would
then perhaps explore the ranch and
peep longingly into the clustered
tents of the workmen. And finally,
after a last reassurance from the
office that, unfortunately, they
could not go into the dormitory,
they would turn toward the row,
and picking their reluctant way
over adobe, lumber and debris,
proceed to the depressing choice of
one of the ten new skeletons for
their home. Why we should all
have been so possessed with the
idea of a year's boarding might be
hard to explain, and now that we
have all been gently coerced into
the places prepared for us, there is
probably not a family which does
not rejoice to be under a roof of its
own.
About this time, when more were
coming and the cottages almost
completed, shopping trips to San
Francisco became the order of the
day. At this stage of the proceed
ings no one had a nurse-maid, so
the children had frequently to be
left in charge of their learned
fathers while the mothers took the
early train to the city. Ladies'
memorandums were an interesting
study, for, in view of the patient
gentleman nurses left behind, one
precious day must be crowded to
its utmost capacity, and the arti
cles to be purchased ranged from
parlor carpets down to clothespins
at four dozen for"a bit." October
first was almost here before the first
family took possession of its house,
and, while the stars looked in at
the curtainless windows, slept 011
the floor with a sense of vast relief
in being at last "at home."
The summer had been interest
ing, but not always easy. With
the cloudless sky always beaming
above us we perversely longed for
the patter of rain. With palms
and cacti galore our souls yearned
after grass. With the most perfect
dust in existence powdered white
over the vegetation, we unreason
ably missed our mud. With thirteen
flourishing saloons to comfort us
and the three hundred other inhab
itants of Menlo Park, we still
thought regretfully of some trim
little elm-shadowed villages of the
East. For those who came early
the waiting was long. So long we
watched the workmen hammering
away under the arcades, and won
dered if ever the long aisles would
resound with more scholastic
echoes. So long we endured the
stuffy rooms and lamentable food
of our boarding-places. So long
the half-dozen gentlemen walked
daily through the beating sun the
two dusty miles to Menlo Park and
earned by this defiance of Califor
nia custom the sobriquet of "tramp
professors." They carried their
lunches in little baskets, and when
noon came it was truly interesting
to behold this embryonic faculty
eating its dinner. They sat in a
picturesque row under the arches,
resting themselves upon the low
stone wall bounding the arcade.
The lunches were dreadful aggre
gations and quite inadequate in
quantity besides. And these poor
scholars, founders of a great uni
versity, were said to look with envy
upon the stenographer who bad a
phenomenal landlady and brought
large pieces of frosted cake, and to
cast surreptitious glances toward
the basket of the President, who
brought his dinner from his own
menage and ate it contentedly at
the point of the jack-knife.
The Professor from Boston used
to flee to the city every day or so,
ostensibly on business, but in real
ity—as he confessed when the libra
rian charged him with it —" to get
a cup of coffee." This practice
nearly got him into trouble, for
presently, among the bills for uni
versity material sent from the city
office to the office of the President for
auditing, there came one from a city
restaurant bearing the simple leg
end: "Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, Dr.: To one terrapin stew,
$1.25."
Suspicion at once fastened upon
the man who went to the city for cof
fee, and it was only with difficulty
that he was able to clear himself of
the charge of carousing upon terra
pin stew at the University's ex
pense.
So the summer passed away,
and enthusiasts though they were,
there might have been in the heart
of each one sometime a secret
thought fitly expressed in a brief
dialogue I overheard one day. Two
were standing on the hotel porch
at twilight watching the train across
the road getting ready to start for
San Francisco. Said one, deject
edly, "Let's get on board and go
home," and the other answered
with alacrity, "Any moment you
please."
But when September arrived and
the rest of the faculty began to
come in rapidly; when the build
ings of the quadrangle one by one
grew silent and completed; when
registration day approached and
all work rushed forward to the be
ginning of the term, such excresent
regret as there was died forgotten
and all interest centered on the
coming opening.
The people of the State were at
last convinced that the University
intended to begin in earnest on the
Ist of October, and they came in
force to attend the exercises of that
day. Some one reported that " in
the early morning the streets of
San .Jose and Santa Clara were
alive with vehicles carrying people
to Palo Alto," and, although this
has a slightly mythical sound, it is
certain that long before the time
for beginning the audience was
gathering upon "the ranch." The
horses were tied wherever there was
place round about and the visitors
pressed into the quadrangle and
took up the seats. Trains ran up
to the buildings on the switch used
to bring freight from the railroad,
and unloaded guests on the spot.
By half-past ten, when the exer
cises commenced, the "great,
bright quadrangle contained some
thing over an acre of humanity,"
if I may be permitted the expres
sion. The seats in front of the
platform were full, back of them
hundreds stood up, and those who
could find no place within earshot
promenaded the arcades and talked.
• The sky was at its bluest, and
the red tile of the low continuous
roofs glowed against it with a soft
brilliance. Again, below the buff
stone, the shadowed arcades, the
eight banks of greenest foliage
rising from the quadrangle floor,
the gay flags and flowers decorating
three entrances, and on the fourth

side the entrance arch transformed
into an embowered alcove about
the speakers' platform; the golden
California sunshine glinting radi
antly over the whole. To right and
left of the platform pampas plumes
and palms sprang lifteen feet up
into the light. Lower down pal
mettos and delicate bamboo sprays
encircled the edge and were them
selves encircled by long festoons of
grapes banging in gigantic clusters
entirely across. The Stars and
Stripes fell in rich folds at the sides
of the alcove. Overhead fluttered
banners, while a fringe of drooping
eucalyptus seemed to supply the
one tender minor note in the tri
umphant decorative harmony, turn
ing our eyes and thoughts to the
portrait of the boy, Leland Stan
lord, which looked down upon us
with so serious eyes from the
alcove's background.
When Mr. and Mrs. Stanford ap
peared, the University slogan was
for the first time heard. Some four
hundred students were present,
seated together near the platform,
and at this moment, after three
cheers, they gave down very credit
ably and with immense enthusi
asm, " Wahoo! Wahoo! L. S. J.
U!. Stanford!" Then we felt that
the University was born. The re
porters, "seated in a body in the
little pen under the platform's
edge, have given to the world a
sufficiently detailed account of the
exercises. The cameras perched
pracariously upon the roofs or
mounted on stilts in the midst of
the audience, have revealed to a
continent the fact that the repre
sentative of the Board of Trustees
made his address under the shadow
of a parasol held by the President;
while the President, when bespoke,
was in turn protected by the pro
fessor of mathematics. Has the
public also been told that when the
proceedings were over and the fav
ored guests had gone to lunch at
the Stanford residence, the crowd
sat down in the cool arcades to eat
its lunch, and for dessert appro
priated the decorative grapes from
the deserted rostrum?
Four hundred students, both dor
mitories full, Alvarado row almost
settled, classroom work begun —so
it looked the Monday after opening
day. Four hundred and seventy
live is the number at present. They
have had their first disturbance at
Encina Hull, with an expulsion or
so following, and settled down to
work.
The month between has been busy
and progressive. The boys'gymnas
ium has gone up, more professors'
houses are begun, and Alvarado
row has its sidewalk. With the
unexpected number of students the
President has renewed his con
genial activity in the matter of ap
pointing new instructors. We have
begun to make our newspaper rep
utation. Out of their own rich ex
perience, Cornel lians will sym
pathize with our dismay when we
discovered, taking its unhindered
march through the press, the
amazing statement that "Senator
Stanford claimed the right to expel
students who do not behave as he
thinks they should do, and that
200 boys were recently saved from
expulsion only by the intercession
of Mrs. Stanford with the infuri
ated old man." When a Western
journal takes the trouble to fabri
cate, it spares no pains to place its
produce at the top. The fine and
generous amplitude of the "200
students," and the exquisite in

appropriateness of the wild and
wooly adjective applied to the
gentlest of men, could hardly be
equalled in the effete East, and
mark the fiction as an indigenous
growth of our adopted soil.
The quadrangle is busy now with
its proper activity. Classrooms are
full to overflowing; and when the
triangle suspended in the archway
jangles musically the signal for
change, the passing of the students
fills the colonnades with a stream
of life and motion. Between hours
a studious silence reigns, gently
broken by the murmur of the lec
turer's voice as it sounds through
the open window. A student or two
crossing the court, a group or two
studying under the arcade's airy
shelter, accent the scholastic intent.
Back and forth from Palo Alto
station lumbers Paulsen's mam
moth omnibus, characteristically
built to hold forty passengers, and
with it runs a smaller vehicle, fun
nily labeled "Stanford's Univer
sity." Back and forth from the
station, morning and night, from
San Jose, from Santa Clara, from
lied wood, from San Francisco
even, come and go non-resident
students.
It would be no wonder if the
rumor were true that Alvarado row
has been dubbed by the students
"The Decalogue," for up out of the
stubbletield rises this row of ten, as
yet unsoftened by lawn or shrub or
tree, and presenting to Encina, at
the other edge of the stubble, a
front of uncompromising rectitude,
perhaps sufficiently suggestive of
the moral law. At meal time, from
one end of the row to the other, the
various professors may be seen to
issue from their various houses
bearing pails —wooden pails, gran
ite-ware pails, tin milk-pails, any
kind of pails —and wending their
way to the huge, unsightly water
tank which stores the precious yield
of an artesian well near one end of
the row. About the same time if
you look out of your backdoor, you
will see various of the faculty
ladies picking up chips to start the
fire with, or even gathering in
wood from the huge wood-piles.
One day we beheld the professor of
pedagogy striding across the open
toward May held, and presently
back he strode again, bearing in his
hand a vermilion buck-saw, and
was soon thereafter decried attack
ing his wood-pile with all his char
acteristic energy. All this pending
the advent of servants and consid
erations of propriety. Pending the
advent of the electric light, the
flicker of the tallow dip was for
some days the only light shed upon
the student page at Roble and En
cina. The candle is still in vogue
in the row, and as electricity is ex
pected at any moment, a redwood
block or a bottle serves every pur
pose for holding the primitive
taper.
Perhaps it is the spirit of the
West, perhaps it is the vital breath
of the Pacificcoming into us over the
mountains, but whatever it may
be, some enchantment, has blinded
us to the crudities, the drawbacks,
the limitations of our state. The
giants looming in the path of the
pioneer appear but frivolous wind
mills in our eyes. Come not out to us,
oh, doubting Cornellians, thinking
to return untouched by the unrea
sonable enthusiasm. Christmas
shall bring you, and the months of
spring shall bring you, critical,
skeptical, curious, sneering after
our library, questioning about our

funds, and you shall return —if
you return at all —chanting aw fer
vently and irrelevantly as we " Die
1 lift der Freiheit weht."
