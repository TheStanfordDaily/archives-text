## 1905 Representatives Play a Good Game.—Varsity Practice. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the Fresh
man team, to the coaching of which
Fiokert has gone lately with
strange words in his mouth, cov
ered itself with glory by defeating
a team from Santa Clara College
by a score of sixteen to nothing.
Compared with the former prac
tices and with the game against
Palo Alto High, the youngsters
played fine ball; there were a few
fumbles, and some of the plays
were ragged, but the Freshmen went
into the game with a snap and en
thusiasm which has been hereto
fore lacking. The visitors had men
on their team who played a good
game, among these being Feeny
and Bounds, the two halves; Re
gan, the quarter; Magee, fullback,
who made some good kicks; Keefe,
right end, whose game was snappy
and vigorous; and Ivancovich, who
played a good game at left end
against Wilbur. Paul Tarpey for
the home team did some star play
ing onjjkicks, end runs, and tackles;
the short-legged Freshman is quick,
nervy, and heady. ' His kicks are
fair, his tackling sure, and his runs
always good for a gain. A tackle
of Bounds made during the game
by the brilliant half was one of the
finest ever seen on the Stanford
gridiron. The same sort of game
was played by Max Bartell, the
other half, whose striped stockings
flickered over the tield for several
good runs, proving that in him
Captain Fisher brought with him
this fall at least one good man from
the north. Sefton's work was as
usual sharp but steady; Wilbur
did several good things in the way
of tackles; and Van Sickle, Dave
Tarpey, Stillman, and Crothers
played the game hard. The line
up was as follows:
SANTA CLARA. STANKOKO.
Ivancovich.... 1 E r Wilbur

Nihill of Santa Clara was um
pire, Horan, '05, referee. and Hans
bach, '04, and Uaumeister of Santa
Clara, linemen. Twenty-minute
halves were played.
A fenture of the afternoon was
the presence of a lusty Rooters'
Club, under the aide leadership of
Corbusier.
Tarpey's fifty-five-yard run past
tackles to a touchdown in the first
three minutes of play was the most
spectacular part of the whole show;
no goal being kicked, the score was
5 to 0. Magee of Santa Clara made
a good kick, and Bartell and Tar
pey made twelve yards between
them, Stanford shortly after losing
ten yards on off-side play. Tarpey
kicked and Santa Clara bucked
several times, losing the sphere on
downs. Sefton and Tarpey made
seventeen yards; Stanford fumbled,
but Van Sickle dropped on the

ball; and Tarpey made another
sensational dash of forty yards,
bringing the leather to within one
yard of the goal line. Nihil], how
ever, sent the Cardinal jerseys back
ten yards on offside play, Sefton
and fullback Kehrlein finally
reaching the line, but the goal-kick
again missing. »Score, 10 to 0.
Bartell made a run and Tarpey a
short kick; Santa Clara bucked.
Stanford holding twice, and Magee
attempting a kick, which he fum
bled, but recovered and carried a
short distance in. The visitors sent
in Feeney, who was thrown heavily
by Trowbridge, and Bartell fell on
the ball. Tarpey made twenty
yards and Bartell thirty-five yards,
Stanford forcing her opponents
back by big jumps, using Sefton,
Wilbur and Tarpey. Referee Nihill
then presented his school with ten
yards again, alleging off-side play,
and the red-backed youngsters
took a preceptible brace and de
termined to make this touchdown
over again, Sefton, Stillman and
Dave Tarpey making it by a few
hard bucks and end runs. Tarpey
kicked the goal and the score was
16 to 0. The rest of the half was
uneventful.
Magee made a sixty-yard kick
to start the second half off, and
Bartell ran the sphere in for
twelve yards. Paul Tarpey and
Wilbur followed with short gains.
Tarpey, after a few minor gains,
kicked to Bounds, who made a
twenty-yard run on Stanford's left
end, being cleanly tackled and
downed by young Tarpey in one of
the prettiest plays of the day.
Feeney made a good run of fifteen
yards and was ruled out of bounds.
Santa Clara's fullback made two
yards and the right half made one,
on the next three downs, the best
stop during the game being made
by Van Sickle and Wilbur.
The ball going to Stanford on
downs, Tarpey kicked, and Santa
Clara fumbling, the infants re
gained the pigskin and braced up,
forcing the strangers slowly back
by Bartell, Tarpey, Wilbur, and
young Kehrlein. The ball was on
Santa Clara's fifteen-yard line
when Horan's whistle blew.
In the big team's practice the
second team, re-enforced by Horan
at left guard, and Roosevelt of
Lake Forest at right guard, held
up much better than hitherto.
Knight, at scrub right end, played
hard, and Captain Fisher at Var
sity right half played fiercer ball
than he has before. "Guiby " Dole
held " Fluffy V' place at left tackle,
as the big fellow has a bad knee;
Kulin at Cooper's place at right
end did good work ; and Fredrick
son was tried at Barnhisel's posi
tion at right guard.

Nihill of Santa Clara was um
pire, Horan, '05, referee. and Hans
bach, '04, and Uaumeister of Santa
Clara, linemen. Twenty-minute
halves were played.
A fenture of the afternoon was
the presence of a lusty Rooters'
Club, under the aide leadership of
Corbusier.
Tarpey's fifty-five-yard run past
tackles to a touchdown in the first
three minutes of play was the most
spectacular part of the whole show;
no goal being kicked, the score was
5 to 0. Magee of Santa Clara made
a good kick, and Bartell and Tar
pey made twelve yards between
them, Stanford shortly after losing
ten yards on off-side play. Tarpey
kicked and Santa Clara bucked
several times, losing the sphere on
downs. Sefton and Tarpey made
seventeen yards; Stanford fumbled,
but Van Sickle dropped on the

ball; and Tarpey made another
sensational dash of forty yards,
bringing the leather to within one
yard of the goal line. Nihil], how
ever, sent the Cardinal jerseys back
ten yards on offside play, Sefton
and fullback Kehrlein finally
reaching the line, but the goal-kick
again missing. »Score, 10 to 0.
Bartell made a run and Tarpey a
short kick; Santa Clara bucked.
Stanford holding twice, and Magee
attempting a kick, which he fum
bled, but recovered and carried a
short distance in. The visitors sent
in Feeney, who was thrown heavily
by Trowbridge, and Bartell fell on
the ball. Tarpey made twenty
yards and Bartell thirty-five yards,
Stanford forcing her opponents
back by big jumps, using Sefton,
Wilbur and Tarpey. Referee Nihill
then presented his school with ten
yards again, alleging off-side play,
and the red-backed youngsters
took a preceptible brace and de
termined to make this touchdown
over again, Sefton, Stillman and
Dave Tarpey making it by a few
hard bucks and end runs. Tarpey
kicked the goal and the score was
16 to 0. The rest of the half was
uneventful.
Magee made a sixty-yard kick
to start the second half off, and
Bartell ran the sphere in for
twelve yards. Paul Tarpey and
Wilbur followed with short gains.
Tarpey, after a few minor gains,
kicked to Bounds, who made a
twenty-yard run on Stanford's left
end, being cleanly tackled and
downed by young Tarpey in one of
the prettiest plays of the day.
Feeney made a good run of fifteen
yards and was ruled out of bounds.
Santa Clara's fullback made two
yards and the right half made one,
on the next three downs, the best
stop during the game being made
by Van Sickle and Wilbur.
The ball going to Stanford on
downs, Tarpey kicked, and Santa
Clara fumbling, the infants re
gained the pigskin and braced up,
forcing the strangers slowly back
by Bartell, Tarpey, Wilbur, and
young Kehrlein. The ball was on
Santa Clara's fifteen-yard line
when Horan's whistle blew.
In the big team's practice the
second team, re-enforced by Horan
at left guard, and Roosevelt of
Lake Forest at right guard, held
up much better than hitherto.
Knight, at scrub right end, played
hard, and Captain Fisher at Var
sity right half played fiercer ball
than he has before. "Guiby " Dole
held " Fluffy V' place at left tackle,
as the big fellow has a bad knee;
Kulin at Cooper's place at right
end did good work ; and Fredrick
son was tried at Barnhisel's posi
tion at right guard.
Yesterday afternoon the Fresh
man team, to the coaching of which
Fiokert has gone lately with
strange words in his mouth, cov
ered itself with glory by defeating
a team from Santa Clara College
by a score of sixteen to nothing.
Compared with the former prac
tices and with the game against
Palo Alto High, the youngsters
played fine ball; there were a few
fumbles, and some of the plays
were ragged, but the Freshmen went
into the game with a snap and en
thusiasm which has been hereto
fore lacking. The visitors had men
on their team who played a good
game, among these being Feeny
and Bounds, the two halves; Re
gan, the quarter; Magee, fullback,
who made some good kicks; Keefe,
right end, whose game was snappy
and vigorous; and Ivancovich, who
played a good game at left end
against Wilbur. Paul Tarpey for
the home team did some star play
ing onjjkicks, end runs, and tackles;
the short-legged Freshman is quick,
nervy, and heady. ' His kicks are
fair, his tackling sure, and his runs
always good for a gain. A tackle
of Bounds made during the game
by the brilliant half was one of the
finest ever seen on the Stanford
gridiron. The same sort of game
was played by Max Bartell, the
other half, whose striped stockings
flickered over the tield for several
good runs, proving that in him
Captain Fisher brought with him
this fall at least one good man from
the north. Sefton's work was as
usual sharp but steady; Wilbur
did several good things in the way
of tackles; and Van Sickle, Dave
Tarpey, Stillman, and Crothers
played the game hard. The line
up was as follows:
SANTA CLARA. STANKOKO.
