With the adoption this afternoon
of the amendment to the consti
tution of the Associated Students,
granting the University President
power to terminate the office of stu
dent treasurer whenever such ac
tion is necessary to enforce Univer
sity regulations, the crisis that
threatened our football season is
passed. We now have a treasurer
and a manager duly qualified and
recognized by the faculty. How
ever the principle of the amend
ment may he regarded it would
have been folly to have defeated
it. With this temporary ad
justment of difficulties we may plan
a new scheme of management as
well as a new constitution, to be

adopted at the close of the season.
Four amendments were added to
our scrapbook today. It is time
we were seriously considering plans
for doing away with the whole
puzzle. Before the end of the year
the student body should have
adopted an entirely new constitu
tion providing a new scheme of
athletic management.
