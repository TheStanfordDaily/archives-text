The Christian Associations were
addressed last evening by the pas
tor of the Third Congregational
Church of San Francisco. He took
for his text the 14th chapter of
Romans, 7th verse: " For none of
us liveth to himself and no man
dieth to himself." He said in part:
" The power we have over other
people's lives was Paul's definition
of influence. Personality is the
most powerful tiling in the world.
It is the base of influence.
"No man lives absolutely dissoci
ated from other people. Men are
related each to the other. We
have an illustration of that in the
strike. .Labor is necessary to capi
tal, and capital to labor. They
are a pair of shears, each a blade.
We have lost the rivet and are
looking for some one to put it in.
"It is impossible to sin without
offending others. Every man who
is wrecked pulls down other wrecks.
One of the terrible laws of life is
that no man can sin without of
fending other people. It makes
life serious, earnest, and solemn.
" Vices have influences and so
have virtues. *The good we do lives
after us.' We carry music or dis
cord wherever we go. Personality
is the greatest thing in life. It is
a great power if God has given it
to you to influence. I3lessed are
the people who carry sunshine in
their hands. They are the power
of the world.
" We are all dependent on some
body and someone on us. It is a
very beautiful thing to see a pow
erful life, more beautiful to me
than a work of art.
" We cannot bring back influ
ence that goes, out from us. The
word that you speak can never
be recalled, the deed clone can
never be altered. We should
recognize the immense power of
living. Life is a serious thing and
we ought to live our best.
" To be good means to be honest,
to have character, to lie pure, to be
rigbt with our fellow-men and with
God. The good man occupies the
throne of power. They are always
to be depended upon.
"The last thing I have to say is,
use your influence on Christ's side,
not on the wrong side. Death
makes the man larger, greater, bet
ter. Death multiplies the contri
butions we make to life. llemein
ber you are responsible for what
you do, what you say, and what
you are. The question, is it, right?
That is the line on which you are
to go. It is wonderful to live, but
how responsible we are for deeds ! "
