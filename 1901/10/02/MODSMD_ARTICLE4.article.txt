# Spaulding Arrives.

### 
Graduate Coach Spaulding, '9G,
arrived on the campus today and
viewed the work of the football
men for the first time this after
noon. He is very well pleased
with the progress already made,
and says Fickert has done excellent
work in such a short time.
Plans for the coaching are not
yet fully matured, hut only await
the arrival of McMillan, who will
he here the first of next week.
Spaulding said this afternoon:
" We are going to inaugurate a new
system of coaching this year, simi
lar to that in operation at Yale
and other Eastern colleges. We
intend to establish a Stanford sys
tem of playing, rather than a team
system, and gradually build this
up each year, so that our teams
will all work along lines peculiar
to Stanford alone. Tlte coaches
will decide among themselves what
work shall be carried on with the
men, and this will he followed
strictly, so that each day the coach
ing of every man will be planned
out ahead by the coaches. We ex
pect a great deal of criticism from
the grandstand and critics, but we
will pay no attention to it. We
are responsible for the team, and
we are going to decide what is best
for it, and carry out our own ideas.
If the team loses the lÂ»ig game, it
will be a case of '1 told you so,' but
if we win nothing can be said. As
soon as Mr. McMillan gets here
the work will be divided systemat
ically, so that each player will be
under close supervision."
