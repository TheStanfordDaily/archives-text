### 
A musical treat of the highest
order will he offered to the faculty
and students of Stanford Univer
sity in the near future. Herr Ar
thur Fickenscher, the famous pi
anist and composer, has kindly
consented to give a performance
of Humperdinck's celebrated opera,
" Haensel und Gretel" in Assembly
Hall on Tuesday, October 10th.
Engelbert Humperdinck is con
sidered by musical critics the
greatest living composer of operas,
and the success of his " Haensel
und Gretel" can be compared only
to the success of Richard Wagner's
music-dramas. The text of " Haen
sel und Gretel" is based on the
well-known fairytale of Grimm,
which Humperdinck interprets by
music of the rarest simplicity and
beauty. Since the artists who will
take part in the performance have
gratuitously offered their services,
the admission will be small enough
to enable every one to go. The
entertainment will he given under
the auspices of the German Semi
nary.
