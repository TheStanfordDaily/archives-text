## 
### 
The song and yell committee of
the University of California has
awarded the prize for the heat poem
out of the hundred submitted, to
Miss Urace Coat.es. Her song,
written to the tune of "Coon-Coon-
Coon," is entitled "Foot-Ball-Hall-
Hall" and is as follows:
Blue, Blue Blue, we sing for Cali
fornia,
Gold, Cold, Gold, we all shout Rah!
Rah! Rah!
Red, lied, Red, that color we hate
to see,
Will swallow them up like Pharaoh
in the Red, Bed Sea.
Howl, howl, howl, then shout our
Oski Wow,
All play ball, and teach the lob
sters how.
Yell, cry, bawl, just mash them to
the wall,
We'll break their bsicks, disgrace
them, in football, ball, ball.
The second best was a very
touching poem, entitled "Good-bye,
Stanford Dear," written by C. Re
gor. None of the yells were re
warded with a prize.
