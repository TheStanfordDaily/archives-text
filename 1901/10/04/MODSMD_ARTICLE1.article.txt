# UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL.
## Players Who Will Go into the Contest Against Reliance Tomorrow. 
### 
Stanford'salreay vigorous meth
od of coaching the candidates for
the various football teams was fol
lowed yesterday by the new grad
uate c »ach, Spaulding, '96, who
has already proved by no means
slow or lazy. His sharp driving
policy is in direct accord with that
followed by Fickert and Lewers,
and the squad and the bleachers
are already loud in his praises.
The strenuous life which Coach
Yost caused the football men to
lead last year, has, with Field
Captain Raitt's energy and leader
ship, caused this year's team to
play faster and fiercer ball than
for several years hitherto. And
Fickert, Lewers, and Spaulding
are still by no means satisfied.
Tomorrow's game with Reliance
will, it is hoped, show great im
provement over the campus game a
week ago. The line-up for the con
test with the city players will be,
as nearly as possible, that of the
past week's practices. Boren's un
fortunate illness will lose the Car
dinals a good man, and Knight
will be put into the line-up in the
sick man's place. Sefton, whose
brilliant game in this position on
the Freshman team has lately
been very noticeable, will also, in
all probability, be given a show.
But Knight, who has played a
good game this week, will have
first choice, and his war-cry will
doubtless be heard tomorrow above
the din of battle. Traeger's place
at left tackle will be held by
"Guiby" Dole, as the big man's
knee will not permit him to go in
to the game. It is believed by
many, and the bleachers evidently
concur in this opinion, that
Thompson, Hauverman, and Barn
hisel will touch shoulders in
the big game; they doubtless will
do so tomorrow, although "Tub"
Lee, Hayden, and Horan may also
go into the Reliance game. Mc-
Fadden's injured left knee gives
Kuhn, who has recently been put
ting up a dashing game, a chance
to play at tackle, and will give
Cooper, whose work is always
steady, right end in tomorrow's
line-up. The backs will be as
heretofore, Hill, Fisher, Smith,
Barker, and Slaker going into the
game. Parker did some fine work
last night in Slaker's position.
On the whole, the second team,
re-enforced by Lee and Horan, is
holding the Varsity down much
better than it did earlier in the
season. Its faint-heartedness has
disappeared and there is every
chance now for it to work up to
last year's standard. Last nighl,
the second eleven right end Lut
gerding showed several good plays;
Shields, Fredrickson, and "Stew"
Taylor made some good stops, runs,
and tackles, and Horan got into
the game better than in former
practices. Bansbach, Patterson,
Frizelle, and Blodget were back of
the line and played hard. Cap
tain Fisher is wearing off the
roughedges rapidly, kicking quicker
and better, and following interfer
ence better than before.

The Meld itself is as good as it
ever was, l»ut that means little; it
is ceriain that if it keepsoll getting
harder from day to day there will
be more broken bones this season
than there were last year. Another
thing that should be arranged for
as soon as possible is the training
table; Berkeley's men went to
theirs about a week ago; and many
of our players still eat at the
"Chinaman's."
The trainer yesterday found a
man, who has been playing the
game hard, "filling up on mush at
the Chink's, 1 ' when, to quote "Dad"
again, "he should have been eating
porterhouse steaks —a man can't
play football on chicken feed."
Some very pretty, hard-fought
scrimmages between the two Fresh
man teams are occuring at each
afternoon's practice; last night the
first team, composed of Sefton,
Stillman, Galbraith, Nissen, I) ti
Tarpey, Crothers, Wilbur, Haven,
1\ Tarpey, Bartell and Kehrlein,
bucked the scrubs, who were as
sisted by some of the big second
team; and, after this, they were put
through short signal practice by
Coach Lewers. Fumbles and off
side plays, while not nearly so fre
quent as before, are still noticeable
in their practice.
The regular Varsity line-up, with
the exception of Boren, will goto
the city tomorrow. The team, as
nearly as can be ascertained, will
be: Knight, 1. e.; Dole, 1. t.;
Thompson, I. g.; Hauverman, c.;
Barnhisel. r. g.; McFadden, Kuhn,
r. t.; Cooper, r. e.; Kaitt, q. b.;
Slaker, Parker, 112. b.
The following men will leave in
the bus which will be at the train
ing-house at 9 o'clock in order to
catch the 9:37 train: Fisher,
Traeger, Raitt, Smith, Sinker, Hill,
Bansbach, Thompson, Hauverman,
Barnhisel, McFadden, Barker, Al
len, Dole, Cooper, Kuhn, Horan,
Roosevelt, Knight, Hayden, Sefton,
and Lee. The game will be played
at the Sixteenth and Folsotn streets
field, and will begin at 2:80 p m.

afternoon's practice; last night the
first team, composed of Sefton,
Stillman, Galbraith, Nissen, I) ti
Tarpey, Crothers, Wilbur, Haven,
1\ Tarpey, Bartell and Kehrlein,
bucked the scrubs, who were as
sisted by some of the big second
team; and, after this, they were put
through short signal practice by
Coach Lewers. Fumbles and off
side plays, while not nearly so fre
quent as before, are still noticeable
in their practice.
The regular Varsity line-up, with
the exception of Boren, will goto
the city tomorrow. The team, as
nearly as can be ascertained, will
be: Knight, 1. e.; Dole, 1. t.;
Thompson, I. g.; Hauverman, c.;
Barnhisel. r. g.; McFadden, Kuhn,
r. t.; Cooper, r. e.; Kaitt, q. b.;
Slaker, Parker, 112. b.
The following men will leave in
the bus which will be at the train
ing-house at 9 o'clock in order to
catch the 9:37 train: Fisher,
Traeger, Raitt, Smith, Sinker, Hill,
Bansbach, Thompson, Hauverman,
Barnhisel, McFadden, Barker, Al
len, Dole, Cooper, Kuhn, Horan,
Roosevelt, Knight, Hayden, Sefton,
and Lee. The game will be played
at the Sixteenth and Folsotn streets
field, and will begin at 2:80 p m.
Stanford'salreay vigorous meth
od of coaching the candidates for
the various football teams was fol
lowed yesterday by the new grad
uate c »ach, Spaulding, '96, who
has already proved by no means
slow or lazy. His sharp driving
policy is in direct accord with that
followed by Fickert and Lewers,
and the squad and the bleachers
are already loud in his praises.
The strenuous life which Coach
Yost caused the football men to
lead last year, has, with Field
Captain Raitt's energy and leader
ship, caused this year's team to
play faster and fiercer ball than
for several years hitherto. And
Fickert, Lewers, and Spaulding
are still by no means satisfied.
Tomorrow's game with Reliance
will, it is hoped, show great im
provement over the campus game a
week ago. The line-up for the con
test with the city players will be,
as nearly as possible, that of the
past week's practices. Boren's un
fortunate illness will lose the Car
dinals a good man, and Knight
will be put into the line-up in the
sick man's place. Sefton, whose
brilliant game in this position on
the Freshman team has lately
been very noticeable, will also, in
all probability, be given a show.
But Knight, who has played a
good game this week, will have
first choice, and his war-cry will
doubtless be heard tomorrow above
the din of battle. Traeger's place
at left tackle will be held by
"Guiby" Dole, as the big man's
knee will not permit him to go in
to the game. It is believed by
many, and the bleachers evidently
concur in this opinion, that
Thompson, Hauverman, and Barn
hisel will touch shoulders in
the big game; they doubtless will
do so tomorrow, although "Tub"
Lee, Hayden, and Horan may also
go into the Reliance game. Mc-
Fadden's injured left knee gives
Kuhn, who has recently been put
ting up a dashing game, a chance
to play at tackle, and will give
Cooper, whose work is always
steady, right end in tomorrow's
line-up. The backs will be as
heretofore, Hill, Fisher, Smith,
Barker, and Slaker going into the
game. Parker did some fine work
last night in Slaker's position.
On the whole, the second team,
re-enforced by Lee and Horan, is
holding the Varsity down much
better than it did earlier in the
season. Its faint-heartedness has
disappeared and there is every
chance now for it to work up to
last year's standard. Last nighl,
the second eleven right end Lut
gerding showed several good plays;
Shields, Fredrickson, and "Stew"
Taylor made some good stops, runs,
and tackles, and Horan got into
the game better than in former
practices. Bansbach, Patterson,
Frizelle, and Blodget were back of
the line and played hard. Cap
tain Fisher is wearing off the
roughedges rapidly, kicking quicker
and better, and following interfer
ence better than before.

The Meld itself is as good as it
ever was, l»ut that means little; it
is ceriain that if it keepsoll getting
harder from day to day there will
be more broken bones this season
than there were last year. Another
thing that should be arranged for
as soon as possible is the training
table; Berkeley's men went to
theirs about a week ago; and many
of our players still eat at the
"Chinaman's."
The trainer yesterday found a
man, who has been playing the
game hard, "filling up on mush at
the Chink's, 1 ' when, to quote "Dad"
again, "he should have been eating
porterhouse steaks —a man can't
play football on chicken feed."
Some very pretty, hard-fought
scrimmages between the two Fresh
