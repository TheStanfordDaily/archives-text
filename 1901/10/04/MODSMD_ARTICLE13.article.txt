Yesterday morning the Daily
Califomian published the follow
ing editorial:
Last Saturday the Olympic
Athletic Club met the Stanford
Varsity on the hitter's campus. To
say that the treatment of the visit
ing team was disgraceful is to put
it in the mildest possible form. A
violent expression of disapproval
greeted every adverse decision of
the referee. The bleachers, disre
garding every rule of the game,
coached the Varsity on to a certain
victory by cries of' 'Kill them,'
'Break their necks,' and other ex
pressions quite as blood-thirsty.
Nor can the Daily I'alo Alto
excuse such conduct on the ground
that the offenders were 'freshmen,
new or perennial.' If the offenders
were of the first class, such lion-like
conduct hardly accords with our
knowledge of these lamb-like crea
tures; if of the second class, a
single person with courage enough
to take a determined stand could
have stopped the whoie thing.
The two universities are under
a great compliment to the athletic
clubs, and it is but right for us to
acknowledge this compliment. The
test of a true sportsman's spirit
conies when his team is losing. If
Stanford is incapable of acting in
a sportsmanlike manner when
either winning or losing, some

thing should surely be done. We
would suggest two remedies: First,
since imported talent proved so ef
fective on the field lust season, an
experiment might be made this
year with imported rooters; second,
the faculty, in continuance of its
well-defined policy, might delegate
the power of electing a yell * leader
to the Committee on Student Af
fairs, who could forthwith elect
one of their own number. In the
latter case the San Francisco pa
pers might run even a photo, and
the name of the happy person in
actual print.
We cannot mitigate the sting of
the rebuke which comes from our
sister university by calling atten
tion to the exaggeration of facts
and to the bitterness shown in in
sinuation. The above article was
reprinted yesterday in one of the
San Francisco papers and has been
spread to the world. Our reputa
tion has suffered a stain which
only months of retribution can
efface. Our position is defenceless;
the entire student body <>112 Stanford
is necessarily made responsible
for actions of a few irresponsible
members.
