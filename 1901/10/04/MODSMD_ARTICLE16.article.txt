# The
						"Sequoia."
## 
### 
Larrey Uowman's story, "The
Apocrypha of Gorman," begun in
the first number of the Sequoia, i.s
continued in the third number,
which is out today. Oilier chapters
will follow. The initial poem of
today's Sequoia, by Miss Edith M.
Wherry, '02, is a graceful and (in
ished piece of verse, entitled "The
Parthenon at Midnight." A good
sea story is Henry E. Walker's
"Story of the Daunt." There is
also a good story by Miss Edyth
EUerheck, a former member of the
Sequoia staff, who luts returned
after a year's absence.
