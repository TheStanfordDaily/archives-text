# "HAENSEL UND GRETEL."
## Twenty Artists Will Participate in Opera, Preceded by a Vocal Concert. 
### 
The opera " Haensel und Gretel "
will be given Thursday, October
10th. The opera will be given in
English. Over twenty artists, most
of whom are professional singers,
will participate. As the opera will
not fill the entire evening, preceding
if a vocal concert will lie given, in
which songs will be rendered which
are inartistic harmony with the
musical spirit of the opera. The
concert will consist of German
folk-songs, sung by the lady chorus,
which also takes part in the opera.
Three lady soloists will be heard in
some of the best German songs, as
those of Schubert and Schumann.
This will be a musical treat that
nobody can afford to miss. Such
performances as this are rarely
seen on the campus. Professor
Goebel's idea is to give the opera so
that every student may see it. An
admission just sufficient to cover
expenses will be charged. General
admission is twenty-five cents; re
served seats, thirty-five cents.
