# NEITHER SIDE SCORES.
## Varsity Falls Below Standard in Game With Reliance.—Fickert Says Slugging Was Hypothetical. 
### 
Last Saturday afternoon on the
Sixteenth and B'olsom streeLs
grounds the Stanford Varsity foot
ball team played a tie game with
the eleven of the Reliance Club,
neither side scoring. The game
was interesting at every stage and
was played hard by the city team.
Both teams depended mostly for
their gains on punts, Hill being
used by Stanford and llodolph by
Reliance. It was thought at first
that the clubmen outweighed Stan
ford, but the contrary is true; it is
also a fallacy to suppose that the
clubmen were not in good training,
and that they did not play quick
ball. Such men as McNevin, right
end, Varney and Wilson, the two
halves, Dinsmore, left end, Collins,
left tackle, and. Rodolph, quarter,
would be valuable to any team.
On the other hand, with the pos
sible exception of Hill and Traeger,
who played a hard game, and of
Raitt, who stopped up many of
the plays almost single-handed,
none of the Varsity were up to then
usual form. When Reliance made
her usual buck of Varney or Wil
son between guard and tackle,
every clubman got into the game;
but in several of these plays Stan
ford players stood around and
watched the fun. They ran high,
they tackled high,and they bucked
high; and they responded to
Raitt's frantic "Stop 'em up, fel
lows!" like so many wooden In
dians. The crippling of Barnhisel
and MoFadden may have had
much to do with this, but the prob
lem before the team now is: If Ber
keley plays Reliance a tie game,
neither side scoring, and Stanford
plays Reliance the same game, will
Stanford beat Berkeley on the
ninth of November?
The first half was twenty-five
minutes long and the best of it was
to Reliance's credit. Following the
city team's kick-off to McFadden,
who made a slight fumble but ran
the ball in a short way, Hill kicked,
Reliance losing ten yards on off
side play by Collins. Stanford
bucked for the next two downs, and
kicked in the third, Dave Brown,
the referee, giving the Varsity ten
yards again on Collins' off-side
play. Fisher and Hill made nine
yards between them, but Stanford
lost on a fumble, and Reliance sent
Varney and Wilson between guard
and tackle first on one side, then on
the other. It is rather noticeable
that until the last half no plays
were made at center. In the next
few plays Dinsmore and Varney of
Reliance were stopped up and
Stanford gained the spheroid on
downs. Hill kicked forty yards;
Relianee smashed through tackles
and around ends for short gains,
using Varney and \\ ilson. Raitt
and 11 il 1 did some good work here
in blocking. Reliance lost ten
yards on another off-side play and
Piatt kicked thirty-five yards to
Raitt, lli'l returning the favor and
giving five yards better. Stanford
held Reliance's bucks and Raitt
got the leather on a fumble, Stan

ford continuing her kicking game.
The clubmen sent Atkinson hard
ai the line and he fumbled; Stan
ford getting the ball, Hill made a
run across the tield and gained
slightly. I'he club team held well
on the next two downs and Hill
kicked, Knight and Cooper nailing
Piatt. Reliance kicked to Raitt
and tlits latter returned it after his
catch, Hill beating the drove of
canvas-backs to the pigskin; the
ball, however, went to Reliance on
Stanford's off-side. Piatt kicked
to McFadden and Hill followed
suit to Piatt; Wilson and Varney
made nine yards between them;
four times Traeger went through
the Reliance line as if it had been
pasteboard, stopping up their play;
and Piatt kicked to Raitt, who was
stopped by Hamilton. Hill kicked;
Atkinson and Wilson made eight
yards between them; and Fisher
was ruled off on alleged striking of
Atkinson, both telling Bert Oliver,
the umpire, that no one had been
hit. Reliance was pounding Stan
ford's ends, guards, and tackles
when the half ended.
Brown and Oliver changed their
official duties at the beginning of
the second half. Sefton went in in
Knight's place, and a little later
Horan in Barnhisel's, who was suf
fering with a shoulder injured in
Friday's practice. Raitt kicked to
Hamilton, who was immediately
dropped by Sefton, the Freshman
playing a splendid, consistent
game during this half. The ball
was now on the Reliance's thirty
yard line, and was lost on downs to
Stanford, who shortly gave it back
again on downs; Piatt kicked to
Raitt, who wriggled in about two
yards, Stanford making three
yards, but losing it on a buck
through tackle. Hill kicked to
Piatt, who was dropped by Cooper;
Sefton fell on Varney twice; Reli
ance tried Varney again with Wil
son for the next three plays, and,
after a few bucks, lost on downs to
the wearers of the Cardinal. Hill,
Slaker, and Smith made short
gains, and Traeger tried a place
kick at goal, putting it in Wilson's
hands, which gave Cooper a chance
for a tackle. This is the nearest
Stanford ever came to scoring, and
the tide changed when Rodolph
went into Piatt's place at quarter,
kicking splendidly. The wind,
which swooped down over the
grandstand, made these kicks hard
for Raitt to judge. Near the end
of this half, Dinsmore and Cooper,
who were joking and slapping at
each other, were removed by Dave
Brown, Kubn taking right end on
the Varsity.
Hill and Randolph exchanged
kicks, that of the latter making
sixty yards to Raitt, who was
tackled almost as soon as he got
the ball, by McNevin; Hill kicked
to Rodolph, who was stopped by
McFadden, and on the next kick
the ball went high and Smith
dropped Rodolph, Reliance losing
fifteen yards by the misplay. Lee
now took Hauverman's place.
Rodolph's next kick went to Slaker,
who dropped on it and was piled
on, Parker shortly after taking bis
place. The rest of the half was un
eventful, except for a play in which
McNevin and Wilson picked Smith

up with the ball in his arms and
carried him back fifteen yards, the
most of the Stanford team looking
on interestedly. When the whistle
blew at the end of this half Fleck
of Reliance carried away the ball,
and there was something of a
scrimmage, but he finally went off
with it in triumph.

'There were several alleged fouls
during the game. 'The Chronicle
had the following: "Several of the
substitutions were caused by filling
the places of men ruled off for al
leged fouls. First, Captain Fisher
of Stanford was promptly waved
off the gridiron by the watchful
officials because it was supposed he
had slugged Atkinson of Reliance,
but Atkinson declared Fisher did
not strike him, but tumbled him
over backward pretty roughly. The
second expulsion from the game
came late in the second half, when
little Dinsmore of Reliance and
Cooper of Stanford, opposing ends,
were excluded because of alleged
slugging, though each insisted that
the other did not strike him and
that he did not strike the other.
But the officials, Bert Oliver and
Dave Brown, were eager to restrain
all unnecessary roughness, just as
they were to impose penalties for
off-side play."
Relative to the alleged slugging
in the city, Charlie Fiekert said:
"The two men who were fired off
the field were men who never do
any slugging. There were one or
two men in our team who slugged,
being provoked by the holding of
their opponents, all of which is in
excusable. The game was a much
cleaner game than the one played
on the campus the week before."
Coach Spaulding attended the
Berkeley-Olympic game and ac
cordingly is not in a position to
speak of the slugging from personal
observation. When seen this after
noon, he said: "From what lean
learn by talking to individuals in
attendance on the game there does
not seem to have been any evidence
of slugging that would call for
ruling men off the field. I think it
was more of a matter of holding
and particularly in the case of
Fisher I consider it a purely acci
dental affair.
"I wish to say in this connection
that from my personal impressions
of the game at Berkeley the Uni
versity of California men are in
much better condition than the
Stanford players. They are putting
up a much snappier game, and
their team work is very good for
this time of the year. The individ
ual star playing was not marked to
any degree except in the case of
Mini. The campus men played the
two halves of twenty and twenty
live minutes respectively, with a
ten minute intermission, in a little

over an hour. There was very
little time taken out, and tlie most
that wan taken out wins for the
Olympic men, showing strongly
that the Berkeley players were in
fine physical condition. After
every down it was noticeable that
University of California men were
quick to regain their positions.
"A general view of the game
gives me the impression that the
California team is about two weeks
ahead of us. The cheering on tlie
bleachers was well organized, the
band was out and the songs were
good and sung well. I overheard
the conversation of five Eastern
visitors, and they commented par
ticularly on the enthusiasm shown
and on the style of game put up in
the West. It was their opinion that
there is very little difference be
tween the games put up here and
in the East this time of the year."
Tomorrow the following men
will go to the Alto restaurant,
where the training tables are to he
instituted: Fisher, Thompson,
Traeger, Hill, A. R. Dole, Slaker,
Hayden, Raitt, Hauverman,
Knight, Sefton, Barnhisel, Cooper,
McFadden, Allen, Smith, Lee, Bans
bach, Parker, Horan, and Boren.
Board will cost five dollars a week,
and the hills of fare are under the
supervision of Trainer Moulton.
