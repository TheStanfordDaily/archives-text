# Encina Parade.
## 
### 
Last Saturday evening, to the
boom of a drum, the tooting of a
horn, and the encouraging words of
"Bill" Irwin, the annual "la robe
de chambre" parade was started at
Encina. Marching single file to the
hall where the Roble dames were
holding revelries the mass of howl
ing, yelling, and singing ghosts
proceeded. Here various fantastic
and awe-inspiring figures were gone
through with, the 1 loble and Var
sity yells were given, and then,
singing "Good Night, Ladies," the
merry students proceeded to Dr.
Jordan's, to visit the faculty recep
tion. After a word of commendation
on their devotional appearance by
Mrs. Jordan, the fellows proceeded
through the quad, making strange
and weird scenes amid the arches,
to the residence of Dad Moulton,
who, as usual, said he could not
speak. From here the gliosis lock
stepped to the S. A. E. house, to
help in its formal dedication, and
then to the postoffice steps, where,
amid soul-inspiring yells the ban
ner of the parade was raised aloft
on the flag-pole.
