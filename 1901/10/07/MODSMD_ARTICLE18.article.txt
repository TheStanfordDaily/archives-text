# Encina At Home.

### 
The Encina Club held their first
At Home of this season last Friday
evening. The music was furnished
by the best orchestra in San Fran
cisco, Heinz's, and was excellent.
The decorating of greens and leaves
with the yellowed lights made a
pleasant contrast from the usual
red. Dancing lasted from about
8 until 12 p.m. and was enjoyed
by nearly one hundred couples.
The patronesses were Mesdames
Jordan, (ireeii, Wilbur, Storey, and
Miss Kav. The affair was as
nsna 1 in all wavs a irreat, success.
