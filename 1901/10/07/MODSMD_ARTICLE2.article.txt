# FANCY DRESS PARTY.
## Costumes Worn at Roble Were Varied and Elaborate.—Program Attractive. 
### 
The fancy dress party at Ruble
last {Saturday was a great success.
At nine o'clock the grand march
was called in the dining-room.
The costumes were varied and
elaborate. There were small girls
and stately colonial dames;
there were Japanese and Chinese;
Indians and Turks; Geisha girls
and ballet girls—and loads of men
awfully handsome men too —and
so attentive to the ladies! There
were gentlemen in evening dress,
fascinating officers with real brass
buttons, golf men, football men,
and many wearers of the Stanford
'S" and various "membahs" of the
colored population. Among the
most original costumes were a
skeleton outlined in white on a
black domino and an astrologer of
the eleventh century.
During the evening an attractive
program was given. Miss Martin
sang "Dick Danger" in a way that
outdid the original. Her costume
was the fiercest in the room. Blank
cartridges and live snakes height
ened the effect at the close of her
song. Miss Hale gave a pretty
Spanish dance; Mrs. Will Irwin
brought down the house with her
clever pantomimic executions. Miss
Kimball gave a banjo solo; Miss
Li ay gave an amusing impersona
tion of a spoiled child; Miss M.
Brown, dressed as a newsboy, sang
an original song full of local hits;
Miss North, Miss Alden, and Miss
Cravens nave a number of fancy
dances.
