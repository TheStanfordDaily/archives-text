Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The tone of your editorial this
morning on the Daily Califomian's
criticism of our conduct on the
bleachers is so admirable that I
cannot refrain from emphasizing it,
so far as a word of interested ap
preciation may. You call atten
tion to the principle, so important,
yet in the heat of spirited rivalry
so easy to forget, that absolute fair
ness and gentlemanly courtesy to
wards an opponent are the essen
tials of what we call sportsmanlike
conduct, without which it is not an
honor to win an athletic victory.
Stanford men as a whole believe
this, and public opinion should
support your position so strongly
that the sharpest criticism of those
who offend should come from Stan
ford men themselves.
Let me commend, also, the dig
nity with which you pass over the
tiiiiuts which accompany the Cali
fornia's rebuke. Courtesy of
speech is as essential, among
sportsmen, as courtesy of action.
The more representative of Califor
nia men would agree with this, and
would deprecate the insinuating
tone of their daily's editorial. We,
as Stanford men, can help best to
bring a friendly, healthy spirit into i
our rivalry bv following the policy
of your editorial, and ignoring, as j
unworthy of the best California ;
sentiment, actions which seem to i
us ungenerous. It is in that spirit
that we would wish California to I
regard the lapses of which we are
guilty. A Stanford Man.
October 4th, 1901.
Many of our readers who agreed
with us in condemning the dis
courtesy shown the Olympics on
our campus, think our attitude
towards the insinuations of our

rival university in not befitting
loyal Stanford men. We do not
care to seem to defend our action
on ho slight provocation. It is not
possible that our policy should
please all our readers, nor do we
cater to the opinions of any set ol
faction. If our editorials incite
lively discussion we are satisfied.
We expect opposition to a great
many of them. A minority of ob
jections is feared no more than a
majority of approvals is sought.
Our purpose is not to court popu
larity, but to speak our mind.
There would he nothing new in the
world if we were all alike, nothing
worthy of exploitation in our col
lege sheet. With similar tempera
ments and minds there would be no
variety in life. The Daily I'alo
Alto would he forced to suspend
publication for lack of news.
We invite an open and free dis
cussion on all matters of Univer
sity interest. If you oppose our
attitude, we shall be glad to give
such opposition prominence. Per
haps we may have friends to defend
us If not, we shall know how to
defend ourselves by having located
our opponents. If we fail to cover
our Held properly, your assistance
in disclosing our neglect will be
thankfully received.
