# Rev. Grosvenor at the Chapel.

### 
Rev. William Grosvenor of New
York, who preached in the chapel
yesterday morning, took for his
theme the life of Balaam. He drew
a parallel between the way in
which Ood impeded Balaam's
efforts to commit sin, and the influ
ences which deter us from yielding
to temptation.
