### 
Schedule of Games Yet to be Played
by Varsity and Fresh
men.
At the practice last night Coach
Fickert told his men that there
must hereafter be no breaking of
training rules, especially in the
matter of dancing. He said, more
over, " You've got to l>« here on
time, too, fellows. We can't play
football for an hour a day and ex
pect to be in condition for the big
game. We want every man to be
here by half-past four, at least."
The Varsity was lined up against
the Freshmen for a short time last
night to show the infants what a
real live game of football was. The
youngsters played much better ball
than was expected, making slight
gains through the Varsity line.
The feature of the practice was the
game played by Traeger at left end.
This certainly is the best position
the big man has found yet, and he
makes the finest end Stanford has
seen for some time. It is question
able, however, whether he can be
spared from the line, which as yet
fails to hold as it should, especially
on place kicks. The Freshmen
are, on the whole, playing much
better ball than before, and such
men are being developed as Paul
Tarpey, Dole, Sefton and Van
Sickle, all of whom play well. The
team fumbles much as yet, but this
could only be expected from the
baby team. It is to be regretted
that by mistake Wilbur's name
was sent to Berkeley a day late
and that we may lose him for the
1905 eleven. The Freshman is
from Culver (Indiana) Military
School, where he was one of the
stars, and he has been regarded, as
with Sefton, sure for end. He may,
however, be finally allowed to play.
The Freshman line-up for to
morrow's campus game with Berke
ley High is as follows: Sefton, 1. e.;
D. Tarpley, 1. t.; Van Sickle, 1 g.;
Montzingo, c.; Crothers, Nissen, r.
g.; Stillman, 1. t.; Haver, 0. D.
Kehrlein, r. e.; Taylor, Trowbridge,
q. b.; P. Tarpley, 1. h.; Bartell, r.
h.; and Dole, 112. b.
