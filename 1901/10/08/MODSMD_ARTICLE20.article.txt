# Concerning the Orchestra.
## 
### 
The orchestra is not as prosper
ous this semester as it should be.
There seems to be great difficulty
in getting a sufficient number of
players to do the best work. The
concert which the orchestra gave
hist semester received the highest
praise from all sources and gave a
practical demonstration of the fact
that it is perfectly possible to main
tain a good orchestra at the Uni
versity.
The only criticism of the or
chestra that 1 have heard is thai
Ihe organization refuses to play for
farces, etc. The reason for this re
fusal is manifest. If the orchestra
is to make any serious study of
good music it will have its hands
full without doing any outside
work. One concert each semester
is all that it can do well. On the
other hand, if is always possible to
organize a farce orchestra from
among the members of the regular
organization, which, by putting in
a few special practices, can do all
that will be required of it, and the
regular work will not be interfered
with.
It seems a pity that, with the
material at hand, the orchestra
should not succeed, and 1 wish to
make a special plea for the sup
port of all who can play any or
chestral instrument. We should
have twice as many violins as we
now have, and violas are sadiv
needed. We should have at least
one more clarionet player and one
mere slide trombone. Another
cornet is also needed, as well as
'cellos.
The next rehearsal will he on
Wednesday eveningof this week, in
room 88, at 7:80. i hope that we
may see a largely reinforced mem
bership at this rehearsal.
