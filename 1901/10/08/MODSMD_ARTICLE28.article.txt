### 
At the last annual meeting of
the Stanford Club of Portland,
Oregon, the following officers were
elected: F. A. llasch, '98, presi
dent; Harry Sladen, '98, vice-presi
dent; and Henry Labbe, secretary
and treasurer. The executive
committee is composed of the above
named officers and 11. J. O'Neil,
'99, and George McMillan, '97.
The club was organized in June,
1896. Its history has been a
record of steady increase in size
and strength. The total member
ship is now about sixty. Thirty of
these are active members; most of
Ihe others are engaged in business
elsewhere than in Portland.
Eighteen of the members are gradu
ates, thirty-two are ex-students,
and ten are undergraduates.
Monthly meetings are held in a
room furnished and rented by the
club. Here the Daily Palo Alto
is always on file, a constant means
of keeping in touch with Alma
Mater. The meetings, always well
attended, are informally spent in a
social way. Stanford songs fill the
intervals between college stories
and college gossip. Light, refresh
ments usually bring these meetings
to a close. The club's members are
looking forward to having perma
nent rooms in the near future.
