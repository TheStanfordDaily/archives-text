# Eastern Trip for Berkeley Athletes.
## 
### 
The track team of the University
of California will probably go East
next spring to meet the teams of
the large universities, and to enter
the intercollegiate games at Mott
Haven. The student body execu
tive committee have decided to send
an aggregation if the financial
prospects warrant it. Enough
money to guarantee expenses will
l>e asked from the students and
alumni, the rest to be provided by
meets held during the trip. It is
estimated that the total expenses
of the trip will be about $3000.
