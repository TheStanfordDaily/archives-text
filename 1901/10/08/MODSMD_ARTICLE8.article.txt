# "DAD" MOULTON ON TRAINING
## The 						Crack Trainer Makes Some Pertinent Suggestions to Our Athletes. 
### 
" Dud " Moulton has the follow
ing suggestions to offer to those
who are in training, either for foot
hall or track. He reiterates the
fact that it is practically useless to
waste time with men who do not
keep strictly to the rules. Mr.
Moulton says:
in the first place, i wish to em
phasize regularity above all things:
regularity in sleeping, regularity in
eating, regularity in the taking of
exercise, in short, regularity in
everything. There is no such thing
as poor training; it is either good
training, or no training at all. J
• lo not think that a man has to go
through a trying ordeal in order to
get into condition. If a man is
athletically inclined he will enjoy
proper training. A man should
try for the event for which nature
has fitted him. In running it is
almost impossible for a well-condi
tioned man to hurt himself, even
for long distances. For a man to
enjoy, and he benefited by sprint
ing, he must train up to it by prac
tice and the observance of com
mon-sense rules of regularity.
Likewise with football men.
J will make 110 hard and fast
rules to train by, but will give a
few general suggestions to be fol
lowed more or less closely. Self
denial, manly principles, and tem
perance are essential. As I said,
regularity is the secret of success.
It is well to combine the old school
with the new. In regard to diet the
old school was very strict, with its
rare meats, toast and tea. The new
school believes in a more liberal
diet. 1 agree with the new school.
Eat plain, well-cooked food; avoid
coffee, liquor, and tobacco; use tea,
milk, and water with moderation;
fruit, if ripe and fresh, ice cream,
tapioca pudding, and .green-apple
sauce may be eaten. In regard to
a regular hour to retire, say 10:30
or 11. The old school taught get
ting up at 5:30 and exercising be
fore eating; 1 do not believe in this.
One should rise at 7 or 7:30, open
the window, and take a little arm
exercise, dress, and go to break
fast.
You may miss some social affairs,
but the sacrifice is necessary if you
intend to train properly. Failure
in respect to the keeping of train
ing rules is what makes third-prize
winners, failures, and half-hearted,
second-rate football teams. One
may go to amusements now and
then, but he should return in time
to go to bed at his regular hour.
Show a loyalty to the pur
pose you have in view. The
table is half the energy of the
team; you can't work without food.
1 can't condition the men here as
I did in the East, because of the
fact that the men carry so much
University work. 1 have always
worked in}' men in the morning,
sprinting and jogging. The'men
say they haven't time for such
things, yet they spend time loafing
and filling social engagements.
Every man should bend his whole
effort to what is before him. Cut
off tennis, handball, and basket

ball, and work for the event in
which you wish to excel. Again,
let nie call your attention to the
importance of regular habits. All
trainers agree that that is half the
battle. And there is still more in
it than the immediate results in
athletics, for the man who trains
conscientiously while in college
will acquire regular habits that
will cling to him as long as he
lives. Don't use tobacco or liquor
in any form, and never more than
one cup of coffee a day."
