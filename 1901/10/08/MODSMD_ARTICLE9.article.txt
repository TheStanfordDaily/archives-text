The advance sale of tickets for
the opera " Haensel und Gretel "
has heen very large. This is grat
ifying to those in charge, since they
have gone to great expense to make
the program a success. The inten
tion is to take in only enough
money to cover expenses. It is
Professor Goebel's desire that there
he placed before the people typical
high-class German music.
The opera is based entirely in its
nature on the German child-songs
which have heen sung for centuries.
The opera has had phenomenal
success wherever it has heen pre
sented, not only in Germany hut
in many foreign countries. The

worth the price of admission. It
embraces German songs from the
most ancient to the modern and
most highly developed. The con
cert will be given in German, but
the opera will be preset)ted entirely
in English.
