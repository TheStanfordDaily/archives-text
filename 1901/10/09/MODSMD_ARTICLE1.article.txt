# TWENTY-ONE TO SIX.
## Freshmen Defeat Berkeley High School This Afternoon. Practice News. 
### 
This afternoon the Freshman
eleven defeated the Berkeley high
school team on the campus by a
score of 21 to 6. Stanford made
three touch-downs in the first half
and one in the second, kicking but
one goal; the high school made its
score in the first half. Mayo, the
left half, played the star game for
the visitors, and Sefton, Dole, Van
Sickle, and Stillman did good work
for the Freshmen. A detailed ac
count of the game will be published
tomorrow.
The line-up of the two teams
was as follows:

Last night, for the second time
this season, the Freshmen were
lined up against the Varsity, and
to the surprise of everyone the
smaller team played through the
big line apparently at pleasure,
smashing guards, tackles and ends,
and rapidly pushing their adver
saries down the field to a touch
down in the first seven minutes of
play. The only excuse for the big
fellows is that they had not yet
had time to warm up, while the '05
team had been playing and was in
good shape. The fact remains that
Stanford's line could not hold last
night as well as it held in the
games with the Olympics or with
Reliance. Several times the Fresh
man fullback was sent over the
best men in the big team's line,
while tackles and halves made big
gains around the end and one of
Fisher's kicks was splendidly
blocked.
The truth is that the baby
team played good, quick, snappy
ball, and that, the Varsity was
spiritless and sluggish. It was all
the more noticeable because nearly
every man of the Freshmen was
badly fagged at the end of the prac
tice, while the Varsity was hardly
winded, and immediately went to
work on the second team, smashing
them up in much better shape than
it had the youngsters. Hill's and
Barnhisel's absence from the Var
sity eleven, and the crippled
shoulders and knees of many
others, would, with the fact that
Traeger was played at end, tend to
remove some of the disgrace. The
better food of the training-table,
together with the accompanying
"jolly up" which always occurs
when football men get together, is
doing much to gel the men in
better shape.
The unusually large number
of crippled knees this season is
giving Trainer Moulton great
anxiety, and the only explanation
he can find is that given by
Traeger, that the men run too
high, buck too high, and tackle too
high.
