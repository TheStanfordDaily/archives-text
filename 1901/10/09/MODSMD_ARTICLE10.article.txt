Tomorrow evening students and
faculty will have the opportunity
to hear the German opera " Haen
sel und Gretel," in English. Twen
ty professional actors from the city
are to assist in the presentation,
scenery has been painted for the
occasion, and calcium lights will be
used; these add enormously to the
bare cost of staging a production
here. Professor Goebel, who is pro
viding the treat for the University
community, has assumed the re
sponsibility for all this expense,
and has, at the same time, lixed
the price of admission at a figure
which will barely cover the outlay.
We may not only show our appre
ciation of good opera and good
music, but we may display our
gratitude to Professor Goebel for
his effort in bringing these to us.
