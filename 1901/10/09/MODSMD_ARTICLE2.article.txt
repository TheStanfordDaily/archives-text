# VIEWS OF PHILIPPINES.
## Dr. Alice B. Condit, First American Woman to Visit the Interior, Lectures Here. 
### 
Dr. Alice B. Condit, the first
American woman to go to the in
terior of the Philippines, last even
ing gave an instructive lecture,
illustrated by lantern slides. Tak
ing the audience past an island
volcano into the harbor of Manila,
where the wrecks of the Spanish
war ships and the old castle were
shown, and up the Pasig river,
crowded with native craft, she
landed them at the city. After a
survey of Manila, a journey was
made by way of the only railroad,
then by boat into the outlying
country, ihence back to the city.
In connection with the pictures as
they were shown, the lecturer said:
Often the people prefer to build
their houses on stilts to avoid the
dampness. These dwellings are
made of bamboo and native palms,
and no nails are used. Groves of
banana trees surround the city,
preventing the spread of tire. Many
houses are built in Spanish style
by the better classes, but no mortar
can be used on account of the
earthquakes which occur. In the
islands as a whole there averages
an earthquake a day. Old Manila
was built three hundred years ago
and is perhaps the finest walled
city in existence. It fulfills one's
idea of all the peculiarities and
quaint characteristics of an old
town. It is surrounded by a double
wall, for each of which there is a
moat. These moats, running all
around the town, were filled by the
sea-water that lose and fell with
the tide. This has been of great
benefit in cleansing them of the
sewerage which gathers. There are
eight entrances to the city, and 011
going in one passes through two
gates and over two drawbridges,
which, in the time of the friars,
were drawn up every night.
The native woman is most ener
getic. She keeps the money and
often does the earning. She is in
dustrious, thrifty, and cleanly, and
has a good business head. Her
children she keeps perfectly clean
and well clothed. Their dress is
always like that of their parents.
For breakfast she has biscuits that
were baked the day before, and
chocolate. She buys the milk for
the chocolate of the milkman who
brings it every morning in a section
of the trunk of a bamboo. The
milk is that of the water buffalo,
which is indigenous 10 the country
and lives in the marshes.
Every uninhabited spot is
adorned with a luxuriant growth of
bamboo. It was 011 account of this
dense growth and of the frequent
obstruction of water that the
American soldier did not make
better progress in marching over
those islands.
The Jesuit College in Manila is
the best educational institution in
the country. It has at present two
thousand students in attendance.
All the Filipinos are very eager for
an education, and they appreciate
nothing more than the schools
which were given them at once
after hostilities ended. In live
years many Filipinos will be fitted

to hold positions of trust in this
country.
The Spanish priests kept the
government informed of all in
trigues of the natives, knowledge
of which they gained in the con
fessionals. The Filipinos pulled
down many fine churches as the
only way to get rid of the priests
and friars. Now the American
Bible Society and the Y. M. C. A.
are introduced and are doing good
in their quarters at Manila and
elsewhere.
In the interior of the country
the peoplefollow Americans a round
with great curiosity. If news of
their approach is given they flock
out of their native schools and
gather from everywhere. They
take part in gospel meetings with
pleasure and enjoy the singing
especially, for they have a great
love for our music. They are seem
ingly anxious for a new creed and
take hold of Christianity eagerly.
The prisons for insurgents are
crowded, and it is there especially
that they show a desire to read the
Bible.
Many beautiful slides were
shown during the lecture. Among
them were pictures of members of
three wild tribes, the Ladrones,
Igonotes, and Negrotes, which have
never been touched by civilization.
These people, as all the other in
habitants of the islands, will in a
few years prove to us their great
ability. Dr. Condit, in closing,
said that during the few days she
is here she would be very thankful
to receive contributions for prose
cuting the Christian work in the
Philippines.

an earthquake a day. Old Manila
was built three hundred years ago
and is perhaps the finest walled
city in existence. It fulfills one's
idea of all the peculiarities and
quaint characteristics of an old
town. It is surrounded by a double
wall, for each of which there is a
moat. These moats, running all
around the town, were filled by the
sea-water that lose and fell with
the tide. This has been of great
benefit in cleansing them of the
sewerage which gathers. There are
eight entrances to the city, and 011
going in one passes through two
gates and over two drawbridges,
which, in the time of the friars,
were drawn up every night.
The native woman is most ener
getic. She keeps the money and
often does the earning. She is in
dustrious, thrifty, and cleanly, and
has a good business head. Her
children she keeps perfectly clean
and well clothed. Their dress is
always like that of their parents.
For breakfast she has biscuits that
were baked the day before, and
chocolate. She buys the milk for
the chocolate of the milkman who
brings it every morning in a section
of the trunk of a bamboo. The
milk is that of the water buffalo,
which is indigenous 10 the country
and lives in the marshes.
Every uninhabited spot is
adorned with a luxuriant growth of
bamboo. It was 011 account of this
dense growth and of the frequent
obstruction of water that the
American soldier did not make
better progress in marching over
those islands.
The Jesuit College in Manila is
the best educational institution in
the country. It has at present two
thousand students in attendance.
All the Filipinos are very eager for
an education, and they appreciate
nothing more than the schools
which were given them at once
after hostilities ended. In live
years many Filipinos will be fitted

to hold positions of trust in this
country.
The Spanish priests kept the
government informed of all in
trigues of the natives, knowledge
of which they gained in the con
fessionals. The Filipinos pulled
down many fine churches as the
only way to get rid of the priests
and friars. Now the American
Bible Society and the Y. M. C. A.
are introduced and are doing good
in their quarters at Manila and
elsewhere.
In the interior of the country
the peoplefollow Americans a round
with great curiosity. If news of
their approach is given they flock
out of their native schools and
gather from everywhere. They
take part in gospel meetings with
pleasure and enjoy the singing
especially, for they have a great
love for our music. They are seem
ingly anxious for a new creed and
take hold of Christianity eagerly.
The prisons for insurgents are
crowded, and it is there especially
that they show a desire to read the
Bible.
Many beautiful slides were
shown during the lecture. Among
them were pictures of members of
three wild tribes, the Ladrones,
Igonotes, and Negrotes, which have
never been touched by civilization.
These people, as all the other in
habitants of the islands, will in a
few years prove to us their great
ability. Dr. Condit, in closing,
said that during the few days she
is here she would be very thankful
to receive contributions for prose
cuting the Christian work in the
Philippines.
