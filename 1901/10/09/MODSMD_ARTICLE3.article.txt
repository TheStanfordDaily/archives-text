W. C. Doub, '96, who has been
Superintendent of Schools of Kern
county for nearly a term, has lately
been in a serious controversy with
the state officials. He introduced
some standard text-books as sup
plementary, while in reality he
made them to supersede the state
series. He also made radical
changes in the curriculum of high
school study, laying a great stress
on composition. Disapproving teach
ers of the county, through the state
printer, drew the state officials into
the controversy. All investigation
was held, in which Doub was ex
onerated 011 account of the good
results which his system was ac
complishing.
