# OPERA AND CONCERT.
## "Haensel und Gretel" to Be Produced in Assembly Hall Tomorrow Evening. 
### 
The story of the opera to be
given tomorrow night is one that
has been told the German child
since time immemorial. It is as
familiar as the Mother Goose tales
are to American children.
Once upon a time there was a
poor couple, a broom-maker and
his wife, who had two children,
Haensel und Gretel, a hoy and a
girl. One day the parents went
to sell their goods, and giving the
children the last bit of bread told
them to be industrious while they
were away.
The children soon grew tired and
began to get hungry. But when
Haensel was on the point of crying
his sister would cheer him up. So
they danced and sang until they
forgot their hunger and work.
At last the mother came home,
tired and out of temper, since she
had sold nothing and so had
brought nothing for the children
to eat. When she found them so
hilarious instead of being at work,
she grew very angry and drove
them forth with blows into the
woods nearby. They were not to
come back before they had filled
their baskets with strawberries.
Then she sank wearily down, over
come by hunger and fatigue.
The children soon became en
grossed in their work and did not
see that they were losing their way
and going deeper into the woods.
Meanwhile it grew dark and they
became afraid and wandered help
lessly around. Everything fright
ened them, the trees, the mists, the
silence. They cowered under a fig
tree till the Sandman, who puts all
to sleep, came and quieted them
with kindly gestures. When they
had said their prayers to the four
teen angels, they lay down and
slept, and the fourteen angels
watched over them and saw that
no harm came to them.
Special scenery for the opera has
been painted by student amateurs.
No expense has been spared to
make the presentation a success in
every sense of the word. The con
cert is to commence promptly at 8
o'clock.
