The simple and terse rules which
were recently drawn up by the ath
letic management for the proper
training of all our athletes have an
importance that is practically ig
nored by the student body. These
rules are not a form followed each
year from habit. They are a dire
necessity, drawn up for reasons of
the greatest importance to the con
ditioning of our athletes. If we
are to develop the best that is in
our football material, we must aid
that aggregation in keeping the
simple resolutions which each
member has made.
Looseness in this matter is not
so much the fault of the football
men themselves as it is of the uni
versal thoughtlessness of the whole
student body. The sentiment, of
that organization is misdirected.
Football men are the heroes of the
hour. They are popularized by the
fellows, and idolized by the girls.
Such sentiment is befitting a col
lege community, when properly di
rected Football men deserve much
more praise and encouragement
than they are given, but this incen
tive should tend to make them bet
ter players instead of causing them
to break training rules.
Sororities give dancing parties
and " at homes," at which those
who have signed training rules are
urged to remain after the stipu
lated time of retiring, and thus to
break their pledge. This is no
doubt unintentional, but it is none
the less effective in weakening our
team. Fraternities are doing the
same thing, while almost every
member of the student body has

encroached on the time of some
player, causing him to stay up
later than he would otherwise do.
Let student body sentiment lend
moral support to the strict observ
ance of training rules. No leniency
will be shown by the coaches from
now on. A man who wilfully
breaks training rules will be forced
from the squad. In such an event
the Associated Students will be
largely responsible.
