# PLUG UGLY CHOSEN.
## C.D. McComish the Successful Author. Dedication Will be October 25th. 
### 
C. D. MeComish, '03, is author
of the Plug Ugly play which wan
selected this afternoon by the com
mittee for the dedication of the
Junior plug. Out of several manu
scripts presented, all of which con
tained clever ideas and were skil
fully written, this one gives the
widest range for outdoor spectacu
lar effect and sensational surprises.
McComish's plot is a sort of par
ody on the epic Paradise Lost,
which was written by John Milton.
Satan, Belial, Moloch, Mammon
and a number of lesser black dei
ties are introduced. The opening
scene represents a blazing lake of
lava, to which the disgraced angels
have tumbled headlong. Coal oil
will help the football grid to burn.
Over this molten plain the imps of
the Junior class will prance in
black gym tights, with blackened
faces and appropriate horns. For
plot, the Juniors will concern
themselves in getting back to that
blessed state whence the wrath in
digna nt has banished them.
Satan is the "leading spirit" of
this movement, but his will is not
always in harmony with the will
of his subjects. In his conflicts
with the rebellious leaders he is,
however, victorious, and brings his
band finally to happiness eternal
by discovery of the great charm,
the Junior Plug.
The plot of this year seems to be
one well adapted to the night cele
bration, which has now become
the custom in the plug ceremonial.
Like last year, it will be a con
nected story, but unlike any of the
three earlier plug dedications, this
one will consist of straight prose
instead of verse.
The dedication, for which will
be charged the customary admis
sion fee of ten cents, is to take
place at the oval on the evening of
October 25th, two weeks from to
morrow (Friday). C. \V. Thomas,
'03, is appointed stage manager for
the performance, and will be as
sisted in his direction by the au
thor, MeComish.
Next week a poster will appear
with harrowing details of what is
to come. The plugs have arrived,
giving ample time for them to be
decorated.
