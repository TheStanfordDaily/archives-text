With apology to the average
reader for quoting this trite phrase,
we feel called upon to publish it for
the benefit of our Freshman foot
ball team. Some of them have
never seen it, or, at least, have
never learned the wisdom thereof.
It reads: "Pride goeth before a
fall."
The surest guarantee that the
babies will stagger home under a
colossal defeat is for them —some
of them —to nourish an already
acute case of swelled cerebrum.
Unfortunately, they have so far es
caped a severe spanking,—in the
form of defeat from some prep,
school —and their confidence is be
coming enormous. This is fatal.
The success in scoring against the
Varsity a few evenings ago, when
the latter was under a combination
of disadvantages, should be encour
aging, but it should not develop
over-confidence.
Gentlemen of the 1900 football
team, you will, within ten days,
meet the Kreshmen from California
in the first intercollegiate contest of
the year, second, only, in import
ance this semester. The hopes of
the University rest in you. Your
two immediate predecessors have
brought home victory. Take care
that you prove yourselves to be
men. Overcome your confidence
with the feeling that you must,
every one as a man and all of you
as a team, play the game of your
lives for the honor and glory of
Stanford.
