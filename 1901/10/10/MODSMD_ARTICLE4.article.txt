# YESTERDAY'S GAME
## Freshmen Play a Ragged Kicking Game With Berkeley High School. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon two teams
more evenly matched than the
score shows met on the campus,
and Berkeley High, the visiting
eleven, was beaten by the Fresh
men by a score of 21 to 6. The
line-up of the two was given yes
terday, but both teams used men
rather freely. The work done by
the visitors was consistent, steady,
and hard, Kerns, right half, Plum
iner, right tackle and captain,
Dorn at right guard, Lacy at right
end, and McQuesten at left end do
ing the best running, blocking and
tackling. Kerns and McQuesten
are a pair of wonders; the half
back is fast and sure, and was the
equal of any of his opponents'
backs; and the Indian, McQuesten,
is one of the best tacklers and
blockers that has ever played
against a Stanford youngster team.
McQuesten made the visitors' sin
gle touchdown, running down a
crowded Held and dodging Tarpey
by cutting in past him before the
Stanford man could tackle. On
the other side Sefton, Dole, Bar
tell, and Van Sickle seemed to play
a very good game, while Paul Tar
pey and YY'ilbur were not up to
their usual form. Young Dole
seems to he a coming man; he is
quick and steady, and plays the
game brilliantly. Moreover, he
does not suffer from overweening
self-confidence. Sefton was ap
pointed captain for the day by
Fickert, and he handled his men
skilfully and well. Symmes of U.
C was umpire, and Slaker referee
during the first half, and Horan
during the second; MeCaughern,
'02, and McKeown of U. C. offici
ated as time-keepers; and Roose
velt, '03, and Hall of Berkeley
High were linesmen. Twenty-min
ute halves were played.
Stanford made her first touch
down in eight minutes, using Tar
pey, after a fumble by Berkeley
High; the goal-kick would have
scored, but a Stanford man was off
side. Following the High School's
kick to Wilbur, who, with Kartell
in the next play, was dropped by
Kerns, Stanford kicked, but was
blocked by Plummer. The infants
then used Bartell and Tarpey in
short gains, Sefton finally making
thirty yards and stopping with
Kern's tackle. McQuesten did
some good work here stopping them
up. Stanford's fumble gave the
bag to her visitors, Patton kicking
to Tarpey, who succumbed to the
Indian and Kerns. The Cardinal
fellows punted; the High School
used Kerns round right end, but lie
was stopped by Y r an Sickle; and
McQuesten tried between tackle
and end and made a thirty-five
yard run to a touchdown, the goal
kick scoring. Score 5t06 in favor
of the High School boys.
'After a few useless bucks by the
striped-legs, Dole broke through
and blocked Patton's kick; and
Bartell seized the ball and ran it
in twenty yards for a touchdown,
goal-kick missing, as usual. Score
10 to 6.

After Berkeley High's kick to
Bartell, Stanford tried two downs,
and failed to make more than
three yards, Ferguson and Lamb
getting in on the game splendidly.
Wilbur kicked to Mayo; McQues
ten made a short gain, but the
visitors kicked. Berkeley High
blocked well, and Stanford kicked
to Salinsky, who made forty yards
to Dole. The fellows from over
the bay had worked the Freshmen
from the center of the field to their
five-yard line when they lost the
spheroid on downs, Stanford fol
lowing suit with commendable
courtesy. The ball was about on
the Freshmen's five-yard line when
the whistle blew.
After the Cardinal's catch of
Patton's thirty-yard kick, Berke
ley got the ball on a fumble and
gave it back the same way; Stan
ford used mass plays with Bartell,
Dole, Tarpey, and Still man, push
ing her visitors steadily back; but
she gave up the leather with a
kick to Salinsky, Dole soon after
blocking the high school's kick,
but Patton kicked again to Sefton.
Dole made twenty yards to Sa
linsky's tackle, Bartell took it. al
most to the line, and Dole put it
through tackle. Goal-kick was again
missed. Score 15 to 6. An ex
change of kicks and of nasty fum
bles followed and Hall finally se
cured the sphere, leaving it on
Stanford's twenty-yard line. But
Berkeley fumbled to Bartell, and
Tarpey and Patton traded punts
twice; Sefton secured the ball from
Tarpey's fumble and in this and
the next play secured a touchdown,
the goal-kick this time happening
to go between the uprights. Score
21 to 6. The rest of the half was
uneventful.
The Varsity played a good art
icle of ball last night. The line
held up better than before and
ends and backs were in good shape.
It is rather to be deplored that
another good rubber can not be
obtained; Austin is a good man
and works hard, but he can not
rub forty-four football men and
two dozen track athletes every day
and do good work to all of them.
Football men are not particular
about the rub-down they get, and
it is said that student labor woul(J
give as good effects as any.
