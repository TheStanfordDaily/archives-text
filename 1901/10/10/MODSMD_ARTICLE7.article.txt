### 
The committee, consisting of Ed.
Oilman, '02, Paul Parker, '03, and
Arthur Henley, '04, for the award
ing of the prizes for the best foot
ball song and yell, met this after
noon and awarded the prize of $10
for the heßt song to M. A. Thomas,
Jr., '04. The song is entitled
"Just Because They Hit That Line
So Hard," to the tune of "Goo-Goo
Eyes." The words are as follows:
A wise old man in Berkeley town
Went out to view the skies;
He scanned the heavens all around,
Announcing with surprise
That he could see some Stanford
stars —
But from their course they soon
would turn
And fall into the hay,
And Berkeley's crew, in gold and
blue,
Would have the right of way. —
He missed his guess about a mile.
Chorus—
Just because they hit that line so
hard,
They went through U.-C.'s center by
the yard;
And when the game was done,
Those "falling stars" had won —
Just because they hit that line so
hard.
Now, Berkeley, when you prophesy,
Be careful what you say;
When stars are falling from the sky
They sometimes come your way.
Just take a lesson from the past —
A constellation struck your goal
And tilled you with dismay,
Remember, when your prophet said
You had the right of way,
He missed his guess about a mile.
Chorus —
A song to the tune of "Coon,
Coon, Coon," by F. B. Maynard,
'02; oiie by C. K. Studley, '03, en
titled "We Played Ball," to the air
of the "Tale of a Kangaroo"; an
other by the same, entitled "An
swer to Palms of Victory"; and a
toast by Beebe, '03, to the tune of
the "Tale of a Kangaroo," were all of
great merit and will be included in
the Football Song-Book, which will
be published as soon as possible.
An excellent song, entitled "The
Blue and the Gold," to the tune of
"The Blue and the Gray," was
handed in by L. W. Jones of Palo
Alto, but not to compete for the
prize, as Mr. Jones is not a student.
It will be included in the song
book.
The prize of $2.50 for the best
yell was awarded to F. B. Wagner,
'03. The yell of second rank was
written by 11. Anderson, '04. The
prize yell is as follows:
.[Slow] Car-r-r-ramba!
Sacre Diablo!
*Ay de Ber-ke-lee.
[Long] Ah!
[Quick] Car-r-r-ramba!!
*Alas for Berkeley.
