# HIGH AND LOW PUNTS.
## This Week's Football Showa the Mid-Season Slump Early.—Tomorrow's Line-Up. 
### 
All this week, and beginning
with the game last Saturday
against the Olympic line-up, the
Stanford squad has been suffering
from a severe case of tired feeling,
resulting in a slump which pre
vented the Cardinal from scoring
over Saturday's opponents and
which has caused the big fellows
to succumb to the strenuous efforts
of the infants during the first of
the week. Every team goes
through this depression, however,
and, as it generally occurs in the
middle of the season, Stanford is
lucky to have its epidemic of use
lessness so early. There are two
reasons for the slump: one is that
the men. are naturally worn out
and lack enthusiasm, and the other
is the want of a training-table,
which, even when it has been
started, operates badly at first.
The team has, however, recovered
somewhat from the epidemic, so
that last night, and the night be
fore, fairly good ball was played.
The main fault which the heroes
in canvas exhibit now is that they
run high, buck high, and tackle
high, while, of course, the best
training is on the man in the field.
Coach Fickert has tried for some
time to obtain an outdoor tackling
bag, and until he does the one in
the gymnasium will he used every
evening after dinner. The team
has been in general, it may besaid,
remarkably well treated in the way
of clothes and other equipment.
Beginning with next Monday thn
training-tables will he located at
the I'hi Delta Tlieta house.
Tomorrow the first line-up of the
Varsity will be: Left end, Clark;
left tackle, Traeger; left guard,
Thompson; center, Hauverman;
right guard, Barnhisel and Horan;
right tackle, "Big" McFadden;
right end, Cooper; quarter-hack,
Raitt; halves, Hill, Fisher, and
Smith; and fullback, Slaker. Of
these, Clark, who prepared at
Iloitt's, is a sure, quick player, his
tackling being way above the aver
age. Traeger's work has been
steadily improving and he is one
of the best men on the field.
Hauverman since the first of the
week has been playing a whirl
wind game, and has smashed
through the opposing line in good
shape, it always breaks up the
backs and rattles them to have a
big lineman dash in among them
and mix things up,—and this
"Havey" has been doing.
Fisher has been improving slow
ly; he runs lower and tackles bet
ter, but seems to use his hands
poorly. Horan is doing good work;
lie seems to take coaching well and
plays hard. Hill deserves much
praise for his punting and block
ing, and for the way he has come
out on the field lately in spite of a
crippled leg. It will be the object
of the coaches, it is believed, to get
the guards and tackles out better
on the interference, and the center
and ends will be, as far as can be
judged, highly developed bv the
drivers of the gang, for after trying
the center once or twice and failing,

the opposing captain generally
runs the ends.
The Freshmen are coming up
much belter than before. Bartell
seems to have been playing a game
of ii high grade; and Van Sickle's
defensive work has been excellent.
Dole is good at all times, especially
on defensive work and for blocking
kicks; and little Taylor passes well
and plays a good game for his
weight. Next Monday night, from
among the stars of the Freshman
constellation a captain will be
chosen, Dole, Sefton, and Tarpey
being among the possibilities. It
will be known definitely tomorrow
whether or not Wilbur can play on
the team. A good man who was
lost to us through no fault of his,
is Hunter, an assistant in Linear
drawing, and therefore ineligible.
