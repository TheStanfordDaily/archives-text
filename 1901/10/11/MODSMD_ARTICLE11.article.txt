After reading four bombastic
and thrilling Plug Uglies our wor
thy committee, being in a very
nervous and excited condition,
needed only a slight, incentive to
cause its explosion. This conserv
ative sheet unintentionally gave
that incentive, and today we pub
lish the results. They are quite
entertaining, and will advertise the
Plug dedication wonderfully. The
admission fee certainly should be
raised.
It has been customary for this
paper to publish a synopsis of all
plays and farces selected for pres
entation by student organizations.
What if the Daily Palo Alto was
not officially informed? It used the
the means at hand yesterday for
securing an outline of.the Junior
Plug Ugly. The committee con
siders it a "barren statement of
misinformation," no doubt, because
of its unoliicial character. Three
correspondents of the city papers
were cognizant of the plot, as weie
many students. Our information
was not wholly private.
In publishing the brief outline
the purpose of the paper was wholly
disinterested except to assist in
making the exhibition a success by
arousing as much interest in it iis
possible. The committee could
give no reason for holding the in
formation over. Within a week
the plot would Imvtj been current
in all University circles without
any "yellow meddling 1 ' on our
part. The Daily Palo Alto used
its prerogative as ;i newspaper, and
published its own material.
The Plug Ugly Committee takes
itseif too seriously.

Next Monday the Inter-society
Debating League will meet to plan
a schedule of try-outs preliminary
to the l)ig debates this year. In
order to gain best results from the
contestants and to give the Univer
sity the strongest possible showing
against rivals, it is necessary that
the schedule be made as soon as
possible. According to present ar
rangements, the Oh mot meet with
Berkeley next February is the first
one to come; but it will be well to
consider the possibility « >f a debate
with Nebraska, about which corre
spondence is now under way; with
Washington, who challenged us
last year; or with other institu
tions.
