# COMMITTEE EXPLODES.
## Gives Display of Fireworks Preliminary to Junior Plug Performance.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The committee in charge of the
Junior Plug Ugly dedication
wishes to protest against the dis
courtesy which you have shown it.
Yesterday this committee, ap
pointed by and instructed to act
as representatives for the Junior
class, selected a play for the plug
dedication. When the play was
chosen, it became the property o!
the committee as trustees for the
class that will represent it. The
committee, responsible for the suc
cess of the affair and using its best
judgment to insure this success,
asked that the plot be concealed,
for a time, at least.
Your prerogative would have
allowed you to criticize the wisdom
of such action, not to interfere with
the plans; the Daily Palo Alto
is intended to co-operate with stu
dent enterprises, not to impede
them. Instead of using the auth
orized account presented to you,
which contained more lurid sug
gestions and ominous hints of
what will come than did all the
barren statement of misinformation
which you published, you not only
ignored a vigorous request but you
secured from a private source and
printed the statements appearing
in your article which had been
given in confidence by the author
of the play to a friend before his
production was written, and long
before it became the property oi
the Junior class. Your informant
had not been enjoined to secrecy,
hut what you learned from him
was private. You had no right to
use it after you knew that it was
contrary to the request of those
who are in charge of the perform
ance, whose property in trust it is
for the present.
Although the 1903 Plug Ugly
will be a success and will have a
larger attendance than any pre
ceding affair of the kind, we wish
to reiterate our protest against this
"yellow'' meddling, from which we
had supposed our college papers, at
least, were free.
