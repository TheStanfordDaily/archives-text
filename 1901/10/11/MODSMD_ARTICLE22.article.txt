# University Band.
## 
### 
The University Band has heen
re-organized and is in a flourishing
condition. Professor Martin of the
Latin department, and lately a
member of the band of Chicago
University, who is the leader, is
quickly rounding the men into ex
cellent shape for the football sea
son. G. W. Rein hard, '04, is man
ager. There are twenty-five pieces
in the band and all the men are
interested arid working hard. Last
year practice was held but once a
week, but this year they come
three times a week, on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays, from
4:30 to 6 p.m., in room 121. A
great deal of new music has been
learned, while the old Stanford
songs will be ready by the time of
the big game.
Next Wednesday at football
practice the band will be on hand
to liven things up. It is to be
hoped a large crowd of rooters will
turn out, in order to give our
coaches and team a good sample of
Stanford enthusiasm.
After the Freshman game the
band will probably attend the
practice every other night. very
one will be pleased that the band
has taken such a brace, and if the
students will do their part by
coming out and rooting it would be
of great aid to our team.
