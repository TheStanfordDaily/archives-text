# Insular Decisions.
## 
### 
Profeßßor J. P. Hall of the Law
department will deliver a lecture
on the Insular Decisions on the
22d or '29th of 'this month. These
Insular Decisions are among the
most important ever decided by
the Supreme Court of the United
States, and are not easily accessible
to the general public. They form
one of the three great decisions
rendered by this Court since the
Civil War, the other two being the
decision on the income tax ques
tion and on the legal tender case.
The Insular Decisions deal with the
important sind interesting question
of whether our Constitution should
be enforced in newly acquired ter
ritory, n question that is not easily
understood except by lawyers. Mr.
Hall has been invited to give an
explanation of these decisions and
has therefore prepared a careful
lecture on them.
