# PHILIPPINE SCHOOLS.
## R. S. McLeod, a Former Student, Writes of Conditions at Pila. 
### 
Professor Starbuck of the Edu
cation department has received a
letter from R. S. McLeod, who was
a student here last year, which
gives some interesting facts about
the conditions of the schools'in the
Philippines, now in charge of
American teachers. From Santa
Cruz the writer had gone heavily
armed and with a mounted escort
to the town of Pila. He says:
" The ' gogoes ' were 'taking in'
the procession from all sides with
no friendly faces. It did really
look as though we were establish
ing schools in the enemy's country.
We soon arrived in Pila and 1 was
very much pleased to find it a great
improvement on Santa Cruz.
American ways had been forced on
the people by an energetic com
mander. Everything is done there
on the quick plan. All
rickety fences were boloed down
and the owner ordered to put up
another quick. If a
house was not in good shape, the
owner was told to fix it up and
make it presentable or it would be
burnt down. The streets are a
model for many American towns â€”
clean and well drained. If a pig,
pony, or caribou is seen loose, it is
confiscated. The commander of
the town ordered the people of the
town to build a schoolhouse and
do it quick or there would be
"muclie tribulaeian," and "inuche
querra" in the town. He fright
ened the natives so that they
turned out the next morning 16U0
strong to build a schoolhouse in
which to teach the American ideas
of liberty. The- natives don't
*'sabe" those things yet, but 1
think they will soon learn to ap
preciate them.
"The children are very bright
and pick up English readily. As
far as learning a foreign language
is concerned, they could shame
many American children. Theed
ucational prospect is very bright,
indeed. If things keep moving as
they are at present, there will be a
great change in a couple of years.
English will be the business lang
uage of the towns, and it will be
spoken more throughout the islands
than Spanish ever was.
In connection with Mr. McLeod's
observations, some facts contained
in the report of Fred W. Atkinson,
superintendent of public instruc
tion in the Philippines, are of in
terest. He says the difficulties of
a transition from Spanish to Eng
lish in the Islands will be accom
plished by the gradual process of
educating the youth. The educa
tional system in the archipelago
consists of eighteen divisions, each
with a division superintendent.
Next year, one high school is to be
established in each division, and
teachers' institutes will soon be
held. The greatest present need is
for adequate school buildings; sev
eral teachers now have to carry on
work in one or two large rooms, as
a rule. No protest was made by
either parents or teachers at the en
forcement of the decree forbidding
I religious instruction in the schools.
