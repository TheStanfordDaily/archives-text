# ASSEMBLY HALL RECITAL
## Concert Under the Direction of Mr. Fickenscher.â€”Artistic Production of Opera. 
### 
Last night's entertainment was
one of the most successful and en
joyable conceits in the history of
the University. An audience of un
usual size listened to a program
chosen with exquisite musical
taste and rendered throughout with
an artistic finish such as we have
seldom witnessed here. The first
half of the program was sufficient
to furnish a most delightful concert
in itself. The old German folk
songs were rendered with a pre
cision and delicacy of shading
which brought out their incom
parable beauty. It is difficult to
say which of the three soloists did
the best work. While Mrs. Cox
thrilled the audience with her
sympathetic voice, Mrs. Dexter
showed her excellent schooling by a
most finished interpretation of
Schubert's "Du hist die Rub," and
Liszt's "Lorelei," one of the great
and beautiful songs of the latter
composer. Miss Maud Fay was so
successful with her singing of the
Cavatina from "Frieschulz" that
she was compelled to give an encore.
The performance of Humper
dinek's charming fairy opera
"Haensel and (-*retel" surpassed in
artistic finish anything ever at
tempted here. The singing as well
as the acting of Miss Cullen
(Haensel) and Miss Heath (Gretel)
deserve the highest praise. The
scene where the two lost children
sink on their knees to say their
prayer while the angels appear in
the distance to watch over them,
was of such exquisite beauty that
it will never be forgotten by the
audience.
The greatest credit f< r the suc
cessful performance is due, how
ever, to Prof. Arthur Fickenscher.
He proved himself to be a composer
of extraordinary talent, whose
songs rank with the best of the
German masters. Besides this he
is a highly gifted leader and inter
preter of music, as the chorus work
in the opera and in the folk-songs
showed. Especial mention is de
serving his delicate and discreet
piano accompaniment, in which he
was ably assisted on the organ by
Mrs. Fickenscher.
In thanking Mr. Fickensher and
the rest of the artists for the great
enjoyment they have given us, we
express the hope that we may soon
have the pleasure of hearing them
again.
