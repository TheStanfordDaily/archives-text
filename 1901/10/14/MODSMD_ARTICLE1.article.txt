# OLYMPICS 6, STANFORD 6.
## Varsity Suffers a Slump in the Second Half and is Outplayed by Club Eleven. 
### 
.Saturday afternoon at the Six
teenth and Folsom streets grounds
Stanford played a tie game with
the Olympic Club eleven, the score
being 6 to 6. The two first line-ups
were, with a few minor exceptions,
the same as in the contest between
these two teams two weeks ago,
when Stanford scored 6 to 0 on her
opponent. The first half of the
game was unquestionably with
Stanford, just as the second be
longed exclusively to Olympic.
The chief strength of the city men
lay in the ability displayetl by
Clay and Embrick, the two tackles,
and by Gammon, the right half
back, whose fine, aggressive game
was without a doubt what saved
the day for his team. Stanford's
line during the last half was use
less and was inadequately supported
by the two halves. Another cause
of the failure of the Varsity to hold
her opponents was the absence of
Barnhisel, who was crippled, Trae
ger, who was not in good shape for
two halves, Hill, who was taken
out to give Smith a chance, as were
Cooper and Clark at the two ends
for Kuhn and Knight. Lee was
tried at center during the second
half, and put up a good hard game.
The Stanford coaches, to nearly
every one's surprise, do not express
themselves as entirely displeased
with the result of the game, saying
that it is only the end of a slump
that began with the late tie game
with Reliance. It is interesting in
this regard to recall the words of
Coach Fickert at the beginning of
the season when he said, "We shall
not try desperately to win these
preliminary games, for they are
only practice after all." Neverthe
less, in the second half of last Sat
urday's game the Stanford team
failed to play good ball, and fell
away below the average of the first
of the season. It is to be hoped
that the coaches will soon break
the squad of the almost universal
habit of playing high and letting
their opponents in under them.
Whenever an Olympic or Reliance
half or tackle has bucked our line
he has bucked low and every man
that could has helped him along,
while with Stanford the sensational
allegation used in a city paper yes
terday that a Stanford tackle
stopped six men alone hints too
closely at the truth. Olympic
used the "tackle across" play more
than any other, pounding in be
tween guard and tackle, first on
one side and then on the other, and
occasionally varying this with an
end run of considerable length.
The need of the tackling-bag in the
gymnasium for the Varsity was
very apparent in the game. The
weather was extremely warm, and
in the two twenty-minute halves
both teams felt the heat extremely.
In the first half the club men sent
the ball forward in short gains by
Embrick, Clay, Gammon, and
Hooper, Gammon making the only
considerable run, of twenty yards,
which was stopped by Raitt. Stan
ford held hard and got the ball on
downs. Hill kicked fifty-five yards

to Barnard, who fumbled, and
Stanford plowed through to her op
ponent's goal-line in the first eight
minutes of play, Hill making the
touchdown and Raitt kicking out
to Hill for position, Traeger soon
after making the goal-kick. Score,
6 to 0.
Olympic worked Gammon very
freely in the rest of the half, using
him for a foiled try at a field goal,
and running him through tackles
and guards, but finally giving the
"bunch of air" to her visitors on
downs, when Hill punted forty-five
yards'with nobody at the receiving
end. Parker finally got the ball
and Traeger dropped him, leaving
the sphere on Olympic's twenty
five-yard line. The club men
kicked out <>112 bounds, Stanford
fumbled, Cadwalader kicked thirty
yards,and Hill, by a masterly kick,
sent it back and out of the field
from the center line at the end of
the first half.
Gammon and Hooper led their
team in its forty-five-yard proces
sion down the field in the second
half, the latter running it twenty
five yards down the field after
Stanford's kick and Gammon mak
ing thirty yards around right end.
The city men ran the ends,
smashed between tackle and guard
on the right half of Stanford's line
and between tackle and end on the
left half until the leather was two
yards from Stanford's goal, when
Fisher kicked out. Olympic
quickly brought it back and ran it
through by Gammon, Cadwalader
making the goal kick. Stanford
then braced and followed Hooper's
thirty-yard run, and his stop by
Raitt and Smith, with tactics
which broke up three formations,
and gained the ball on the Var
sity's thirty-five-yard line. The
whistle blew to end the half. Final
score, 6 to 6.
