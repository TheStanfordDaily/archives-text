Words of encouragement and of
warning should be given this week
by acquaintances to every member
of the Freshman football squad.
They must realize that the entire
student body relies on them to win
victory from a team which is con
sidered, in some respects, superior
to them. Our danger is from over
confidence and lack of team work.
Several times Freshman teams
from Stanford have returned home
with the score in their favor because
of the gritty and determined fight
they made against odds which it
was predicted they could not over
come. The game occurs next Sat
urday. Let every member of the
student body plan to lend the sup
port of his presence to encourage
our men to their utmost.
