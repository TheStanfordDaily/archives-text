No provision is made for special
debate preliminaries in case a con
test is arranged with Nebraska.
This means that if a team is chosen
to meet that institution it will be
selected at the Carnot prelimin
aries. Any person ambitious to try
for a possible JNebraska team must
hand his name in for the Carnot
try-outs.
