# Plug Ugly Committee Again.
## 
### 
The Plug Ugly Committee held
another conference this afternoon
and, although none of the members
would give out anything ''offi
cially" or otherwise, it is rumored
that the meeting was held for the
mutual expression of indignation
against the Daily Palo Alto. No
public proclamation was issued.
