All four coaches were interviewed
today regarding the two big games
Saturday. Head Coach Fickert
said: 44 In the first half the team
put up a fine game of football—as
good as they have put up this year.
They didn't go into the second half
with the proper fighting spirit, the
Olympics got them to going, and
walked on them accordingly."
Coach Spalding expressed him
self as pleased at the improvement
shown in team since the Reliance
game a week ago. "The men played
a snappy game the first half, but
in the second half suffered a slump.
This was due partially to tiie
changes in the line-up. Asa whole,
the players were in good physical
condition, and showed the results
of training-table diet."
Coach Lewers, when asked today
to express his opinion about the
U. C.-Reliance game last Saturday,
said: ''Reliancedidn't play the game
they played against us the week
before. Both teams showed lack of
ability to advance the ball, first
down being made only three times
in the first half. This was due to
one of two causes: either because
both sides were weak on the offens
ive, or strong on the defensive;
probably the former reason. For
Berkeley, Womble, at half, played
the best ball, but the strongest
playing of the game was done by
Erskine, right tackle for Reliance,
who repeatedly broke through, and
stoppedplaysbehind the line. When
Erskine was taken out because
of an injury at the end of the first
half, U. C. made their touchdown
through his substitute. Bunting,
which was constantly resorted to
because of inability to gain dis
tances, was poor on both sides. In
general, the game was slow, due to
the heat and the heavy field, and
was not a fair test of the ability of
either team."
