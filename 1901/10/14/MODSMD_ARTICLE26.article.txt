# Ukiah Wins Field-Day.
## 
### 
The fifteenth semi-annual field
day of the Academic Athletic
League which was held Saturday
on the College Jockey Club track,
Emeryville, was won by the Ukiah
high school athletes. It brought to
the front several athletes who will
with proper care and training
make record breakers. Among the
most notable performances were
the running of W. B. Hogans,
Ukiah high school, who ran the
hundred in 10 1-5, and the 220 in
22 3-5, thus establishing new rec
ords for these events. He showed
himself to be an exceptionally fast
man and his game finish in the 220
stamps him as a wonderful athlete.
His team mate, Captain Weller, es
tablished a new mark in the low
hurdles, 2G 2-5. The mile run won
by Weller of U. H. S. showed again
the quality of which these athletes
are made. All the competitors are
to be commended for their sports
manlike conduct during the con
tests.
