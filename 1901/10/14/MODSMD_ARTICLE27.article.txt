Ann Arbor, Oct. 7, 1901.
Dear Mr. Edwards: 1 see by the
Daily Palo Alto you have been
elected student body treasurer —
Congratulations. lam sorry any
trouble arose over the Nourse af
fair; 1 sincerely hope that it does
not affect the spirit of the student
body.
1 am glad that Stanford has so
bright an outlook for the coming
intercollegiate contest, and I will
not be satisfied unless you beat
their 30 to 0 score.
I had a letter from Dr. Murphy,
and he is now located in New
York City.
Our team has started out in great
shape and we hope to keep it up.
We have played two games and
won them, 50 to 0 and 57 to 0.
1 just received a letter from Jack
Sheehan and he wishes a game
there between Stanford and Michi
gan during the holidays. I think
this would draw an immense crowd
there Christmas day. I spoke to
Captain Fisher and Fickert about
it before I came East. There
is great interest in football every
where this year. Please let me
hear from you and what you think
about a game some time during
the holidays. With best wishes
and kindest regards for the boys
and the success of the Cardinal,
Believe me sincerely,
F. H. Yost.
Captain Fisher and Coach Fick
ert were interviewed this afternoon
on the chances of a game between
Stanford and Michigan on Christ
mas, as suggested in letters to
Fisher and Edwards by ex-Coach
Yost, now coach of Michigan.
Moth men said that it was a little
early to determine the matter, but
they would prefer to play the cham
pions of the Middle West and at
present Michigan does not appear
likely to win the championship.
There is considerable talk of
Princeton coming West during the
holidays and it is barely possible
a game may be arranged with her.
This would be the first time a team
from one of the large Eastern uni
versities has come to the Coast, and
the game would beof great interest.
