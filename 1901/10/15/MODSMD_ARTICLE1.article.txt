# COACHES AND CAPTAIN.
## Football Experience of Coaches Fickert, McMillan, Spalding, Lewers, and Searles, and Captain Fisher. 
### 
Charles M. Fickert, '98, wan born
in Bakersfield, 1873. He entered
the University in the fall of '93 and
took a year of preparatory work i

before becoming a regainrly enrolled
student. He had had 110 experi
ence in football previous to enter
ing college. His height, nix feet
two inches, and weight, 205, were
well iuhi pted to the guard's position,
which place be tilled on the left
side of center for four consecutive
years. He was captain of the' 96
team which heat Berkeley 20 to 0;
so far he is the only man who hasl
been captain before his senior year
in the University. Since gradua
tion Fickert has played but little
football, taking a position on last
year's Alumni team, and on the!
Olympic team of '99. He coached!
the Multnomah Athletic Club in
'97 and the Lowell high school for
the '00 season, and worked with
the Varsity in '99 and '00. The
Lowell High team, which won the
championship of the academic
league that season, owed its success
almost entirely to Fickert; Yost
aided in the last few days of work
for the final game with Berkeley
high school.
.Fickert,(aside from his football
prominence, was a man of import
ance throughout his college career.
He had many honors bestowed
upon him both b}' his class, of
which he was president in his jun- i
ior year, and by the student body.
He was vice-president of the latter
during his senior year, and was
elected treasurer on graduation,
which of] ice he tilled for the year
'98-9. The Stanford record for the
16-pound hammer-throw, 132 feet,
was held by Fickert until it was
broken last spring by Brooke, '03.
He also held the record of the shot
put until it was broken by Wilbur
in '96.
Since leaving the University
Fickert has taken up the study of
law and has been admitted to the
bar. At present he is a practicing

lawyer in San Francisco with an
office at 530 California street.
Coach George McMillan, ex-'97,
is an all-round man who has fol
lowed football closely for the last
ten years and who has played every
position from guard to halfback,
lie knows the game as the profes
sor knows his hooks, because he
has studied it in all its changes.
Since very early in the '90's ihere
hasn't been a season that, he has
not been actively connected with
gridiron matters.
Coach McMillan's first appear
ance on the football field at Stan
ford was in the fall of '93, when he
played left, guard oil the Varsity.
He left Stanford in '94, going to
Oakland to take a position as li
brarian and secretary of the Ala
meda county law library. The
fall of '95 saw him hack on the
gridiron again, as captain of the
Reliance team, on which he played
tackle. The season over, he went
to Butte, Montana, in the employ
of Marcus Daly in assaying and
milling. At Kutte he was captain,
manager, and halfback of the fa
mous team of miners, in '96, when
that eleven was at its best. In the
spring of '97 he went from liutte
to Portland, Oregon, where he re
mained up to a couple of weeks

ago. During the four years he was
in Portland he coached the Mult
nomah Athletic Cluh team, which
lost only one game during all the
time it was under his tutelage. It
is conceded to he one of the best
athletic club teams in the country,
being purely amateur.

])r. Alfred B. Spalding entered
Stanford in the fall of 1892 from
the Michigan Military Academy,
at Orchard Lake, Michigan, where
he played left, tackle on the football
team. Spalding did not go out his
first year here, hut played right
end for the Varsity on the '93, '94,

and '95 teams. After graduation
lie went to Columbia, where he en
tered the College of Physicians and
Surgeons, graduating in 1900.
Football did not occupy much of a
place at Columbia until the coming
of Sanford, Vale's famous coach,
and under his coaching there was
developed a team that defeated
Yale in '99. In the' 99 team Spald
ing played right end. Since his
graduation at Columbia he has
been an interne in the General
Memorial Hospital, in New York
City, where he received the ap
pointment in competitive examina
tion.
Coach Spalding conies West di
rect from the hospital to assume
the position here given him last
spring. He acted as head coach
for Midland College, in Kansas,
and while here he had the splendid
training of "Pop'' Miss, Walter
Camp, for two years, and at
Columbia had the benefit of San
ford's coaching. He may be called
a disciple of these famous heroes of
the gridiron, and will, of course,

coach along the lines in use at
Yale. Spalding is a believer in
the rough style of football and a
quick, snappy game, and also be
lieves in tlie strictest possible ob
servance of training rules, lie pre
fers keen competition for every
position on the team, and looks for
the development of team work,
rather than the development of in
dividual stars. -We may expect
much from Coach Spalding, partic
ularly in his-coaching of the ends,
for he has gonedown into the hist
ory of Stanford as one of the
fastest and cleverest ends the Car
dinal has ever had.
At the close of the season here he
will return to New York, where he
has an appointment as resident
physician in the Sloan Maternity
Hospital. He expects to come
back to San Francisco in the
spring and engage in the practice
of his profession.
Charles Ross Levvers, assistant
professor of Law, was born in
Krenchtnwn, Nevada, May 20,
1873. He prepared for the Uni
versity of Nevada, which he en
tered in 1889, and graduated from
in 1893. In the fall of 1894 he en

tered Stanford with advanced
standing and graduated with the

class of '96. While here Mr. Lew
ers was one of the charter members
of the Stanford chapter of the Delta
Upsilon fraternity, as well as a,
member of Phi Delta l'hi, the Law
fraternity. He also belonged to
the lÂ£u|>hronia Debating Society,
of which he was president in the
second semester of his senior year.
Mr hewers was substitute center
and guard on the '95 Varsity foot
ball team, of which Fickert, Carle,
and Williams were the three center
men, as well as playing guard on
his class team in his senior year.
On graduating from Stanford, Mr.
Lewers studied two years at the
Harvard Law School, '96-7 and
'97-8. While at Harvard he played
guard on the Harvard Law School
football team. During '9N-9 Mr.
Lewers practiced law in Los Ange
les, and in the fall of '99 he came
here to take an assistant professor
ship in the Law department. He
was granted his degree of LL. B.

from Harvard this summer. While
he has heen here Mr. Levvers lias as
sisted in the coaching during the
football seasons.
Colbert, Searles of the Komanic
Languages department has lately
been giving his aid in coaching to
the football teams, and has been of
considerable assistance in the work
