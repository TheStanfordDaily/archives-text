# BISHOP DUDLEY.
## Eloquent Divine Preached in the Chapel Sunday Morning. 
### 
lit. Rev. Thomas U. Dudley,
D. D., of Kentucky, chairman of
the House of Bishops at the Epis
copal Convention, preached in the
University chapel Sunday morn
ing. Following a preliminary serv
ice conducted in accordance with
the Episcopal form, Bishop Dudley
spoke on the text from St. Paul's
epistle to the Ephesians, "If thou
shalt confess with thy mouth the
Lord .Jesus, and shalt believe in
thine heart that the Lord has
raised Him from the dead, thou
shalt he saved."
" The man who wrote this letter,"
began the minister, 14 was no ignor
ant fisherman. He wms learned in
the knowledge of the Gentiles as
well as of the Hebrews. He was, I
believe, the greatest man that God
ever permitted to live on earth.
He taught that the Gospel is so
simple and so plain that every
man can understand it. ' Hut can
I believe it? ' That is the question
which men and women are asking
all over this land. They ask how
they can secure this faith. And in
answering them it is very easy to
make hard words take the place of
hard argument. Christ never de
nounced anybody except the heart
less hypocrites who haled their
brothers."
Continuing, Bishop Dudley said,
in part: "Shall I tell my friend
that just as surely as He stood on
the shores of that lake and called
to the fishermen to let down their
nets, after they had cast in vain,
He has called to me to let my net
down into the lake of life. Shall I
tell him that there is the Book
with the record of the Savior's
acts, and receive the reply that it
has been torn to pieces by the
scalpel of theological dissection?
And when 1 have shown him that
this is one of the oldest objections,
revamped in new forms by the
devil, will he tell me that he can
not understand these old script
ures?
"Have you ever tried to estimate
the significance of the history of
the church of Jesus Christ? Put
down at one end of the series
eleven men, without sword and
without learning, but with a cross
in their hands, going out of a little
room to proclaim the blessings of
Christ to mankind. Put that at
one end, and the results of today
at the other. Search the records to
see if you can find anything equal
to the transformation of woman's
relation to society from the idea
that she was a mere plaything, to
the position of reverence which she
holds today. Never was such hom
age known until after these men
had proclaimed from Jerusalem
that Jesus Christ had come from
heaven for our salvation. The
prophecy that "all nations shall
call thee blessed," is fulfilled today
—womanhood is called blessed be
cause woman was the mother of
the Son of God. And it is only in
Christian lands that she is so
highly revered.
"Centuries ago the child who
was of no value to the state as a
Roman citizen was taken to the
hill tops and killed to get him out
of the way; now, the bills around
our cities are covered with chari
table institutions bearing the cross
and extending the arms of mercy
to the helpless outcast of every
description. Every worthy feature

of our nineteenth century civiliza
tion of which we are so boastful —
every one comes from that open
grave of the Resurrection.
"This writer (Paul) says quite
strangely, 'Thou shalt confess with
thy mouth and believe in thine
heart that Christ is raised from the
dead.' What does he mean? If
thy intelligence is convinced —con-
quered—thou shalt give thy will to
Him. To give thy will is to be
joined to Him, and the life you
live thereafter is His, not thine
own. There is more evidence of
the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from the dead than for any other
fact in history. Believing that evi
dence, 1 am joined to Him, I am
saved. What does 'saved' mean?
Saved here, saved in this life. It
is by surrender of my life that I
am joined to Him. The Almighty
is seeking to make character by
the impartation of the life of the
Son of God. There is but one way
by which our lives may be joined
to Him —it is by what the Bible
calls Faith."
