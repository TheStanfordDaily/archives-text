# Gymnasium Notes.
## 
### 
The handball in the gymnasium
has been turned over to a student
committee composed of S. P. Fris
selle, H. Martin, F. F. Guild rum,
A. J. Copp, Jr., and W. F. Dunn,
chairman. Handball will still be
under the supervision of the gym
nasium management, but, in order
that the students may take more
interest in it and that it may re
ceive more attention than Mr.
Storey is able to give it, students
will hive it in charge. There is a
movement on foot to have a tour
nament this fall similar to the one
held last spring.
The names of those who intend
to enter the wrestling tournament
will be called for soon. Those en
tering will be divided into light,
middle and heavy-weight.
The classes were sent out for as
sociation football for the first time
yesterday.
The basket-ball court is now
being plowed and harrowed and
will soon be in good condition.
