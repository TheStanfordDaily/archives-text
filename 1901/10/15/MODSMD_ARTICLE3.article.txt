Our hilarious and juvenile
fellow-publication, "Chappie," re
minds us of ii "mewling infant"
yet unwearied, when it uses ex
travagant similies to describe how
Berkeley will he "ignominiously
defeated" in football. Does "the
Kid" wish to give our football
players as ridiculous a case of self
conceit as he himself already pos
sesses?

the failure of the current issue in
question to make any reference to
the Freshman game next Saturday
was intended for a piece of humor.
This is not true, however. The
" dear, old, polky, idolatrous Par
lor Altar" feels called upon to
come to "Chappie's" defense with
the explanation that the child is
so lost in excursions among the
realms of antiquity to unearth cor
roded jokes that it cannot he ex
pected to treat of timely subjects.
