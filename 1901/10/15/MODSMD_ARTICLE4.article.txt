After the close of football prac
tice last evening a horse and
buggy were driven around the
track on the oval. Some one evi
dently does not realize that this is
no promenade way for the exhibi
tion of horses and vehicles. The
rig had iron tires and the shoes of
the animal made ugly holes in the
dirt. Men who are endeavoring to
train in spikes contend with ob
stacles enough without having the
already poor condition of the track
made worse. The management
should make it impossible for
people who don't know belter to
drive inside the oval.

One of the Plug Ugly Com
mittee — not one of the co-ed mem
bers —made himself liable to im
peachment by his colleagues today
when he divulged a portion of the
plot that is being so sacredly
guarded. He was heard to remark
that among the features of the
dedication would be a seething
lake of fire, a harrowing vivisection
scene, and a d—l of a time all
around. Manifestos are expected.
