# DEFEAT ST. MATTHEWS.
## Freshmen Win by a Score of 11 to 0 in Their Last Preliminary Game. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon on the Uni
versity field, the Stanford Fresh
men defeated a team from St.
Matthews School by a score of 11
to 0, which should have been as
high as 30 to 0, judging by the con
dition of the visiting team. Most
of them were recovering from colds
caught on a recent trip to play
Lick School, and, as a matter of
fact, there were only about half of
the preparatory school's first eleven
men in the line-up, the others being
substitutes and second team men.
Coach Kerfoot declared the whole
team to be in poor shape physi
cally. Lick, it may be of interest
to remember, scored 19 to her op
ponent's 0, in a game with what
was the latter's first team. Yester
day twenty-minute halves were to
have been played, but the second
was cut short ten minutes. Horan,
'05, was umpire; Lanagan, '00,
referee; and Cooper, '02, and lieed,
of St. Matthews, linemen.
Stanford scored her first touch
down in the first six minutes of
play, sending Stillman around St.
Matthew's right end, after a twenty
one-yard run by Paul Tarpey, fol
lowing Howard's kick, an ex
change of kicks by Tarpey and
Howard, a thirty-yard run by
Sefton and a shorter one by Bar
tell. Goal-kick by Tarpey missed,
and the score stood 5 to 0.
Stillman failed to gain with the
ball when the visitors kicked to
him, but he made a short gain in
the next play, and Dave Tarpey
followed this with twelve yards,
being stopped by Kerfoot's tackle.
Taylor fumbled to Boyles of his
own team and Bartell made
twenty-five yards. Umpire Horan
took the ball back and gave it to
St. Matthews on off-side play.
Stanford held and the visitors
fumbled to Stillman, who ran with
it twenty-five yards and fumbled
to Sefton, who made five yards,
when the umpire brought them
back and again gave the ball to
the striped jerseys. It soon went
to the Stanford youngsters on
downs, and they bucked their op
ponents steadily down the field,
Bartell making seventeen yards
around right end, and Dave Tar
pey carrying it twenty yards fur
ther on the other end, and after
wards making the final touchdown.
Paul Tarpey kicked the goal twenty
minutes after the whistle had
blown to begin the game.
Howard kicked thirty-five yards
to Bartell, who fumbled to Boyles,
and Tarpey returned with a thirty
yard punt to Howard, who ran in
five yards to Bartell's and Taylor's
tackle, as time was called.
In the last ten-minute half an
exchange of the leather twice on
fumbles followed Stanford's kick,
and the Cardinal fellows gave it up
on downs on their thirty-five-yard
line, where they held twice, St.
Matthews kicking to Paul Tarpey,
who advanced the ball twenty
yards, using a good straight-arm
in his run. Twenty-five-yard kicks
were exchanged, Tarpey ran twen
ty-five yards past two tacklers, and
the ball was on St. Matthews' forty
yard line when the whistle blew to
end the game.
For the visitors, Chrisman, right
half, played the star game, but
Howard kicked well, and Samuels
and Caminetti bucked and blocked

in proper fashion. Bartell of the
Freshmen, barring his fumble of
Howard's kick, allowed excellent
form; he is one of the surest taoklers
on the '05 team. Nissen, at cen
ter, put up a good game, as did
Crothers at guard. Boyles, at end,
was something of an experiment,
as the (Jhico man has never played
there before, but he did well, recov
ering Bartell's fumble and another
by Taylor (q. b.) that would oth
erwise have been lost. Paul Tar
pey is strong when running through
interference, but he cannot be relied
upon to kick a goal. The team
does not have a man who is with
any certainty able to score this
point.
The elevens lined up as follows:
St. Matthews —Jacobson,l. e.; Sam

Howard, a thirty-yard run by
Sefton and a shorter one by Bar
tell. Goal-kick by Tarpey missed,
and the score stood 5 to 0.
Stillman failed to gain with the
ball when the visitors kicked to
him, but he made a short gain in
the next play, and Dave Tarpey
followed this with twelve yards,
being stopped by Kerfoot's tackle.
Taylor fumbled to Boyles of his
own team and Bartell made
twenty-five yards. Umpire Horan
took the ball back and gave it to
St. Matthews on off-side play.
Stanford held and the visitors
fumbled to Stillman, who ran with
it twenty-five yards and fumbled
to Sefton, who made five yards,
when the umpire brought them
back and again gave the ball to
the striped jerseys. It soon went
to the Stanford youngsters on
downs, and they bucked their op
ponents steadily down the field,
Bartell making seventeen yards
around right end, and Dave Tar
pey carrying it twenty yards fur
ther on the other end, and after
wards making the final touchdown.
Paul Tarpey kicked the goal twenty
minutes after the whistle had
blown to begin the game.
Howard kicked thirty-five yards
to Bartell, who fumbled to Boyles,
and Tarpey returned with a thirty
yard punt to Howard, who ran in
five yards to Bartell's and Taylor's
tackle, as time was called.
In the last ten-minute half an
exchange of the leather twice on
fumbles followed Stanford's kick,
and the Cardinal fellows gave it up
on downs on their thirty-five-yard
line, where they held twice, St.
Matthews kicking to Paul Tarpey,
who advanced the ball twenty
yards, using a good straight-arm
in his run. Twenty-five-yard kicks
were exchanged, Tarpey ran twen
ty-five yards past two tacklers, and
the ball was on St. Matthews' forty
yard line when the whistle blew to
end the game.
For the visitors, Chrisman, right
half, played the star game, but
Howard kicked well, and Samuels
and Caminetti bucked and blocked

in proper fashion. Bartell of the
Freshmen, barring his fumble of
Howard's kick, allowed excellent
form; he is one of the surest taoklers
on the '05 team. Nissen, at cen
ter, put up a good game, as did
Crothers at guard. Boyles, at end,
was something of an experiment,
as the (Jhico man has never played
there before, but he did well, recov
ering Bartell's fumble and another
by Taylor (q. b.) that would oth
erwise have been lost. Paul Tar
pey is strong when running through
interference, but he cannot be relied
upon to kick a goal. The team
does not have a man who is with
any certainty able to score this
point.

Yesterday afternoon on the Uni
versity field, the Stanford Fresh
men defeated a team from St.
Matthews School by a score of 11
to 0, which should have been as
high as 30 to 0, judging by the con
dition of the visiting team. Most
of them were recovering from colds
caught on a recent trip to play
Lick School, and, as a matter of
fact, there were only about half of
the preparatory school's first eleven
men in the line-up, the others being
substitutes and second team men.
Coach Kerfoot declared the whole
team to be in poor shape physi
cally. Lick, it may be of interest
to remember, scored 19 to her op
ponent's 0, in a game with what
was the latter's first team. Yester
day twenty-minute halves were to
have been played, but the second
was cut short ten minutes. Horan,
'05, was umpire; Lanagan, '00,
referee; and Cooper, '02, and lieed,
of St. Matthews, linemen.
Stanford scored her first touch
down in the first six minutes of
play, sending Stillman around St.
Matthew's right end, after a twenty
one-yard run by Paul Tarpey, fol
lowing Howard's kick, an ex
change of kicks by Tarpey and
Howard, a thirty-yard run by
Sefton and a shorter one by Bar
tell. Goal-kick by Tarpey missed,
and the score stood 5 to 0.
Stillman failed to gain with the
ball when the visitors kicked to
him, but he made a short gain in
the next play, and Dave Tarpey
followed this with twelve yards,
being stopped by Kerfoot's tackle.

St. Matthews on off-side play.
