But two days remain for prac
tice before the Intercollegiate
Freshman football game. Tomor
row night the big outdoor rally,
with band and bonfires, and all
that goes to make up the enthusi
asm of such a demonstration, will
take place on the campus. At the
Glee Club concert, Friday evening,
the final send-off will be given.
These rallies are not in honor of
what the men of 1905 have done,
but to impress what we expect
them to do; not to give them con
fident satisfaction, but to fire them
with aggressive determination that
nothing can withstand. Every
member of the student body owes
it to the team and the University to
be present.
