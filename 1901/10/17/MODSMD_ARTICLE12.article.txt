After an absence of more than
a year in foreign lands, the one
survivor who shared in the
beneficence that endowed this Uni
versity, and to whose wisdom, de
votion and strength of purpose the
institution owes the continuance of
its life with the promising future
before it, lias just returned to
us. Since her departure in May,
1900, two classes have come in,
and one-half the student body
has not seen the woman who
is spending the closing years of bel
li fe in perfecting the advantages to
which we have access. The least
we can do to show our gratitude to
Mrs. Stanford is to give her a
spontaneous demonstration ex
pressing the welcome which we all
want her to realize that we feei.
