Saturday afternoon the Fresh
men will play their big game of the
year. They will meet a team equal,
if not superior to them. They have
shown many weak points in their
play in recent practices, but if they
go into the game with the firm de
termination to overwhelm the Berk
eley contingent, their supporters
need have no doubt as to the re
sult. Berkeley freshmen, to be
sure, will enter the Held Saturday
with a similar sentiment of per
severance. Which is the stronger,
"Stanford spirit" or Merkeley en
thusiasm? The former has easily
been paramount in the past. There
is no reason why it should not be
so now. Freshmen, have confidence
in your ability to win, but do not
become over-confident. Never

show the white-feather. Be sports
manlike, but show no clemency. |
True Stanford spirit is "do or die."
See that you possess it.
