Unless the Plug Ugly Committee
gives out "officially" some news
relative to the plot of the Plug
Ugly dedication very soon the
Daily Palo Alto will be tempted
to publish the names of such a
conservative organization. Our
readers have had about all the
"lurid suggestions and ominous
hints of what will come" that they

The committee needs another
" slight incentive."
