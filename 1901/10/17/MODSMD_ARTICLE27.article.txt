A meeting of the Class of '04 will
be held early next week to consider
the question of adopting a distinc
tive form of headgear. There has
been some discussion by the mem
bers of the class of this matter, and
it is the opinion that some ac
tion ought to be taken. Those
who are advocating it say that in
nearly every college in the country
the sophomores wear something
distinctive, cap, blazer, or pipe, and
they think the custom would be a
good one here.
