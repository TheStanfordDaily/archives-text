At the regular meeting of the
Executive Committee, held last
evening, Treasurer Edwards was
given authority to make arrange
ments for the entertainment the
night of the big game, November 9.
The Grand Opera House will prob
ably be secured, the bill being
"The Man from Mexico." The
proposition is to hire the house, so
that whatever profit comes from
the performance will go into the
student body treasury.
The contract for rooters' hats was
awarded to the Haberdasher. The
hat which was chosen by those on
the bleachers yesterday afternoon
is of soft wool, golf shape, all red.
Track Captain McCaughern was
authorized to hand out spikes to
those in fall training, the student
body to stand half the expense.
