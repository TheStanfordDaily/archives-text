# Varsity-Alumni Game.
## 
### 
One of the big games of the sea*,
son will be played at 4 o'clock to
morrow afternoon, when the Var
sity lines up against a picked
alumni team. The occasion will
be made a general "jolly-up," to lie
followed by the Glee Club concert
and send-off to the Freshmen in the
evening at Assembly Hall. There
will doubtless be a big turnout on
the bleachers.
The alumni line-up will be as
follows: Bettison, West Point,
center; Plunkett, U. C. '96, and
Lewers, Stanford '96, guards; Fick
ert, Stanford '98, and Powers, U.
C., tackles; Nourse and Parker,
Stanford '00, ends; McMillan, ex
' 97, and Spalding, '96, halves;
Smedburg, West Point, quarter;
and Rodolph, Stanford ex-'Ol, full
back. The Varsity line-up will
not be decided until tomorrow.
