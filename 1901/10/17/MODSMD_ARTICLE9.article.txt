# ROYAL ITALIAN BAND.
## Celebrated Players Will Give a Concert in Assembly Hall. October 23d. 
### 
The Lloyal Italian Maud lias
been definitely engaged to give a
concert at the UDiversity, in As
sembly Hall, on the evening of Oc
tober 23d. The concert will be
given under the auspices of the
University Orchestra. It was by a
fortunate chance that a vacant
date was found in the engage
ments of the band, and that it was
found possible to secure the band
for a concert at the University.
The University conilnunity and
those living in the neighborhood
are to be congratulated upon hav
ing the opportunity of hearing so
magnificent a concert as this one
will be.
The Royal Italian Hand consists
of fifty-three players, all of whom
are natives of Italy and few of
whom can speak any English. The
band was organized at Philadel
phia, the players being directly im
ported from Italy. During the
l»ast summer they played at Willow
Grove Park, in Philadelphia, along
with Sousa and Damrosch, always
drawing immense audiences. Lately,
while playing at the Pan-American
Exposition in Buffalo, they created
a furor, attracting large audiences
and receiving the highest possible
praise from the press. During the
present week the band is filling an
engagement in San Francisco.
Concerning the concert given there
on Tuesday night of this week the
Bulletin says: "When the ter
mination of the program was
leached with the grand finale from
'Cavalleria Llusticana' the spec
tators broke from all bounds of
restraint. Men jumped onto their
chairs and cheered until the walls
fairly shook. Ladies split their
gloves in frantic applause and ad
ded their bravos to the general
din. The curtain descended, and
people had commenced to move
toward the doors, but the demon
stration showed not the least sign
of abatement. Finally, the band
was reassembled and played the
'Star Spangled Banner' as it was
never played here before."
The conductor of the band is
Signor Guiseppe Creatore. His
conducting is nothing less than
that of a genius. He inspires his
band with a lire, a spirit, and a
musical feeling that makes its per
formances contrast sharply with
those of Sousa's Band, which, with
all its dash and marvelous accur
acy, never approaches Creatore's
performances in the matters of
artistic finish and sympathetic in
terpretation.
In order that as many as possi
ble may be able to hear this con
cert, the price of admission to all
parts of the house has been placed
at (ifty cents. This is cutting the
usual price in halves. The ad
vance sale of seats will be an
nounced later. It is to be hoped
that the hall will be filled on this
occasion, as every successful per
formance of this sort makes it easier
to obtain other attractions for the
benefit of the University.
