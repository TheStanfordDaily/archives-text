of the team is 162 pounds —about
25 pounds lighter to the man than
Berkeley's team.

Coach Fickert when seen today
repeated what he said at the rally
last night: "Our boys have a good
fighting chance against Berkeley.
We are not expecting an easy vic
tory at all. Berkeley's team is
much heavier than ours, —I should
say about twenty-five pounds. In
comparing the two teams the ad
vantage which the Berkeley coaches
have had is apparent. They have
had seventy-five candidates on the
field throughout the season and
have had big men to pick from.
Here there have been not more
than fifteen men whose playing
would warrant them positions on
the eleven and.these have not ap
peared regularly upon the field.
The team work was better in last
night's practice than it has been
this ye;ir.
"Grit, and team work, good,
hard, consistent football will over
come the disadvantages to which
we are put, and make us win."
Coach Spalding spoke of Satur
day's game as follows: " The foot
ball spirit shown by the Freshmen
is about as good as I have seen in
any freshman team. Our men are
capable of playing a winning game.
As far ;is Stanford is concerned, the
Berkeley team is an unknown
quantity, and it is only a question
of whether our Freshmen will have
the heart to fight an up-hill game if
they find themselves up against a
strong team. They may be scored
on in the first few minutes or on a
fluke. Any team has to be on the
lookout for these things. The
Freshmen are capable of overcom

ing such handicap if the men show
the spirit they have shown all sea
son. The center and the ends will
be strong in defensive work, and
the backs in offensive work are
capable of doing all that is ex
pected of them. 1 look for a low
score and think our team ought to
win by a score of 12 to 6. The
men are all in perfect physical con
dition, and no one is suffering from
serious sprains or injuries. 1 hope
that the individual players will be
able to refrain from talking duiing
the game and allow the captain to
do all the talking to the umpire."
Professor hewers said today in
speaking of the Freshman team:
"The 1905 team, though light,
ought to make a. good showing in
the game tomorrow, because they
have developed team work more
j than any previous Freshman team.
If they play the game they have
played at times against the Var
sity, we may feel fairly confident
of winning. But it is always dan
gerous to make prophecies concern
ing a freshman team because it is
never certain that they will play
jup to their best form in the final
j contest."
Coach McMillan looked doubt
ful today when asked as to the
Freshman team's chances with the
| Berkeley babies. "I am rather
| inclined to think that California
! has a little the best of it,"he said,
"though our team has a good
chance. They are all quick, hard
players, and put up a good aggres
sive game, considering that their
team work is not as far advanced
as we should like it to be. They
are not of the kind to get discour
aged, but will come back strong,
even if they are scored against.
The backs are as good as the Ber
keley backs; the linemen are not
as experienced, but they play hard
ball, and are determined—which
is a big consideration."
Professor Searles gave his views
as follows: " I have been on the
Coast hardly long enough to ex
press any first-rate opinion on the
prospects Saturday. I do think,
though, that the Freshmen are a
willing crowd and have a great
deal of reserve force. The team
work in the last few days has im
proved a great deal. I think the
players are a crowd of workers who
will rise to an emergency. This
fact has impressed me a great deal,
and I think they will play on Sat
urday the best game they have put
up this season."

vantage which the Berkeley coaches
have had is apparent. They have
had seventy-five candidates on the
field throughout the season and
have had big men to pick from.
Here there have been not more
than fifteen men whose playing
would warrant them positions on
the eleven and.these have not ap
peared regularly upon the field.
The team work was better in last
night's practice than it has been
this ye;ir.
"Grit, and team work, good,
hard, consistent football will over
come the disadvantages to which
we are put, and make us win."
Coach Spalding spoke of Satur
day's game as follows: " The foot
ball spirit shown by the Freshmen
is about as good as I have seen in
any freshman team. Our men are
capable of playing a winning game.
As far ;is Stanford is concerned, the
Berkeley team is an unknown
quantity, and it is only a question
of whether our Freshmen will have
the heart to fight an up-hill game if
they find themselves up against a
strong team. They may be scored
on in the first few minutes or on a
fluke. Any team has to be on the
lookout for these things. The
Freshmen are capable of overcom

ing such handicap if the men show
the spirit they have shown all sea
son. The center and the ends will
be strong in defensive work, and
the backs in offensive work are
capable of doing all that is ex
pected of them. 1 look for a low
score and think our team ought to
win by a score of 12 to 6. The
men are all in perfect physical con
dition, and no one is suffering from
serious sprains or injuries. 1 hope
that the individual players will be
able to refrain from talking duiing
the game and allow the captain to
do all the talking to the umpire."
Professor hewers said today in
speaking of the Freshman team:
"The 1905 team, though light,
ought to make a. good showing in
the game tomorrow, because they
have developed team work more
j than any previous Freshman team.
If they play the game they have
played at times against the Var
sity, we may feel fairly confident
of winning. But it is always dan
gerous to make prophecies concern
ing a freshman team because it is
never certain that they will play
jup to their best form in the final
j contest."
Coach McMillan looked doubt
ful today when asked as to the
Freshman team's chances with the
| Berkeley babies. "I am rather
| inclined to think that California
! has a little the best of it,"he said,
"though our team has a good
chance. They are all quick, hard
players, and put up a good aggres
sive game, considering that their
team work is not as far advanced
as we should like it to be. They
are not of the kind to get discour
aged, but will come back strong,
even if they are scored against.
The backs are as good as the Ber
keley backs; the linemen are not
as experienced, but they play hard
ball, and are determined—which
is a big consideration."
Professor Searles gave his views
as follows: " I have been on the
Coast hardly long enough to ex
press any first-rate opinion on the
prospects Saturday. I do think,
though, that the Freshmen are a
willing crowd and have a great
deal of reserve force. The team
work in the last few days has im
proved a great deal. I think the
players are a crowd of workers who
will rise to an emergency. This
fact has impressed me a great deal,
and I think they will play on Sat
urday the best game they have put
up this season."
Tomorrow's line-up of the two
Freshman teams as tliey will face
each other in the Intercollegiate
contest is given below, with the
weights of the Stanford men. The
weights of the Berkeley men are
not at hand, hut the average is
considerably greater, closely ap
proaching the 180-pound mark.
They have two men of 200 pounds
each.
