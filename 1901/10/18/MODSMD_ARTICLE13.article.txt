Photographs for the "Quad." —
All fraternities and societies are
urgently requested to secure large
group photographs of themselves
and submit the same before the first

that the cuts may be done in Chi

Eastern firms, thus insuring half
tones of a quality the Pacific Coast
cannot supply. Photographs may
be handed to Mr. Roy Keith, Mr.
H. F. Coolidge, Mr. Paul Parker,
or myself, or mailed to Lock Box
