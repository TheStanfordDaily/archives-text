# The
						New Directory.
## 
### 
The new Directory was placed on
bale at the Bookstore today. In
addition to the usual information
the Directory this year gives the
University record of each student.
The purpose is to let each student
know how he stands and what is
required of him, and to have un
certain records looked up and at
tended to now, so that later mis
understandings may be avoided.
The Directory shows 1(54 officers,
including student associates. In
the student list there are 1170
named. Several new items are in
cluded in the summaries. Of the
1170 students 621 are living on the
campus, 377 in Palo Alto. 106
students presumably come in every
day on the trains, San Jose furn
ishing 02 of these.
