# Italian Band Concert.
## 
### 
The Royal Italian Band concert
to be held in the Assembly Hall
next Wednesday evening is some
thing well worth hearing. This
hand, which played at the Pan-
American Exposition at Buffalo
this summer, has won consider
able fame, and is well deserving of
the name of the "Latin Sousa
Band." This morning's Call in an
account of the great McKinley
Memorial Benefit speaks of this
hand in the following terms:
"While the whole program was
above the average the sensation of
the bill was Signor Guiseppi
Creatore and the Royal Italian
Band. The overture to 'Tann
hauser' was enthusiastically re
ceived, but when in a medley of
patriotic airs the little Latin Sousa
made the great American eagle
scream the house was on its feet
and every pair of lungs in the
theater [jumped themselves empty
supplying wind to the cyclonic
chorus of bravos."
