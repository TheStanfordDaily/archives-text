# Alumni Game Called Off.
## 
### 
The game with the Alumni was
declared off this afternoon by
Treasurer Edwards. The bleachers
had been partly filled when it was
discovered that all the men who
were expected to play with the
Alumni had not arrived. Bettison
and Smedberg, the two West Point
ers who were to play center and
quarter, and llodolph, fullback, did
not come. Coach Fickert, think
ing that the game would not be a
success with the Alumni team thus
weakened, advised Edwards to call
it off.
