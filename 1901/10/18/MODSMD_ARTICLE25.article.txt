# U.C. Freshmen Fail to Score.
## 
### 
The following news item, which
appeared in the Chronicle this
morning, is encouraging: "The
freshman eleven of the university
failed to score against the Berkeley
high school team this afternoon
in a game 011 the college gridiron.
Both halves were short, the first
ten minutes'and the second five. In
the first the high school worked
the ball well down into the fresh
men's territory and Kearn made
two unsuccessful attempts at place
kicks for goal. The freshmen
blocked the first kick and the sec
ond failed to go between the posts.
In the second half the freshmen
were working the ball toward the
high school goal when time was
called. The giime ended without
either scoring."
On October 9th our Freshmen
defeated the same Berkeley high
school team by a score of 21-6, and
the line-up of the Berkeley fresh- j
men will be the same in tomorrow's J
game as it was yesterday.
