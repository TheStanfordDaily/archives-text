# GREETING TO MRS. STANFORD
## Students March to the Residence and Are Addressed by Her. Football Rally. 
### 
The expressions of welcome to
Mrs. Stanford by the students last
evening showed their great interest
in the home-coming of that lady,
and were evidently greatly appreci
ated by her.
The rally preliminary to the
Alumni and Freshman games
started auspiciously last evening
with the strains of excellent music
by the band. A good crowd of
University men gathered in the
Encina club room and until about
7:30 dancing was the main amuse
ment. After several numbers by
the band and some practice by the
fellows in the new football song,
"Just Because They Hit That Line
so Hard," a new Freshman yell
was tried and found to be a suc
cess. It goes in this fashion:
Naughty-five! Naughty-five!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Naughty-five! Naughty-five!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Stanford! Stanford! (Slow)
Naughty-five! Naughty-five!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
After this President McCormick
announced that Mrs. Stanford had
unexpectedly arrived on the 5:30
train. It was proposed that all go
over to her residence and greet her.
Almost immediately the fellows
formed in line in front of Encina,
and marching four abreast, headed
by the band, about six hundred
loyal students proceeded to welcome
their benefactress. The procession
wended its way through the silent
arboretum, past the beautiful mau
soleum, where as a mark of respect
all removed their hats and kept
silence.
When the students came to the
home of Mrs. Stanford the music
stopped, and with one accord all
gave the Stanford yell in true spirit
and then " What's the matter with t
Mrs. Stanford." Shortly, amid
cheers from all, the door of the
mansion opened and Mrs. Stan
ford, evidently much affected, ad
vanced to the porch railing and
waved to the boys. She spoke feel
ingly, and won the hearts of all by
what she said:
"1 hardly know what to say to
you. But 1 will tell you how glad
I am to come back again. 1 have
been away a long time. I have
been away a year and a half. I
have seen a great many things and
I have enjoyed a great many things
during mv stay, but the greatest
pleasure of all is to come back to
my dear home again. 1 cannot tell
you how my heart goes out to you,
how much I am gratified to see you,
and to know that you hold me
dear. My only regret is that —
that Mr. Stanford is not here beside
me, to welcome you also. But he
knows; he knows all our joys and
all our sorrows. That is the
thought which keeps me courage
ous, the thought that he is in sym
pathy with all our ambitions. For
that reason we shall try to follow
his wishes, and to carry out what
he planned.
" 1 had hoped that our buildings
would be more nearly finished, but

you know that we have been un
fortunate—we fell into the hands
of the strikers —hut we are not
anxious about the work. It is pro
gressing. I hope that very soon
we can celebrate in another w;iy
the dedication of the Memorial
Chapel. I am interested most of
all in that building. I have
brought back for you a great many
works of art, the most beautiful
which I could find. I want them
to be an object lesson for you. The
walls of the chapel will represent
the history of our Savior. The en
tire beautiful story will be pictured
there for you.
"When I got here this evening, I
took a little run around by the
chemistry [building just to see how
things looked. Although 1 ditl not
treat myself to a visit inside the
new chapel, as i passed behind the
building i heard the sounds of the
new organ, and that seemed to me
a very sweet welcome home.
" I feel very happy and proud
when 1 see you all here —how many
are thereof you? A thousand? [To
a voice from the crowd.] 1 am
very glad there are so many; 1 am
sure the University has grown, in
this crowd of young, active, rising
men, 1 know there are many who
will be great in the future; you
will lie the statesmen of your
country.
"I ran away from the city to
day, the great noisy city, because
1 wanted to have a quiet rest at
home this evening. [Laughter.]
But this has been a much pleas
anter thing for me, because it is a
greater comfort. lam sorry that I
cannot ask you all to come into
the house, but I am afraid in look
ing over this crowd that there are
too many of you. [Laughter.] I
am afraid my home would not be
large enough! But we shall meet
again, more than once, before the
year is ended."
After a few words of welcome in
behalf of the student body by Pres
ident McCormick, the Mandolin
Club played "The Cardinal For
ever," the Glee Club sang, the Band
played, and then marching around
the circle in front of the house the
crowd departed singing " Good
Night, Ladies."
From here they proceeded to the
old football field past Dr. Jordan's
and Roble, where the big bonfire
was started. Several Freshmen
and Coach Fickert were carried
around in the cart and then made
to speak. Several yells were prac
ticed, the new football song was
tried, and then tired but happy the
crowd of students departed, leaving
the bonfire to sputter its life out.

this crowd of young, active, rising
men, 1 know there are many who
will be great in the future; you
will lie the statesmen of your
country.
"I ran away from the city to
day, the great noisy city, because
1 wanted to have a quiet rest at
home this evening. [Laughter.]
But this has been a much pleas
anter thing for me, because it is a
greater comfort. lam sorry that I
cannot ask you all to come into
the house, but I am afraid in look
ing over this crowd that there are
too many of you. [Laughter.] I
am afraid my home would not be
large enough! But we shall meet
again, more than once, before the
year is ended."
After a few words of welcome in
behalf of the student body by Pres
ident McCormick, the Mandolin
Club played "The Cardinal For
ever," the Glee Club sang, the Band
played, and then marching around
the circle in front of the house the
crowd departed singing " Good
Night, Ladies."
From here they proceeded to the
old football field past Dr. Jordan's
and Roble, where the big bonfire
was started. Several Freshmen
and Coach Fickert were carried
around in the cart and then made
to speak. Several yells were prac
ticed, the new football song was
tried, and then tired but happy the
crowd of students departed, leaving
the bonfire to sputter its life out.
The expressions of welcome to
Mrs. Stanford by the students last
evening showed their great interest
in the home-coming of that lady,
and were evidently greatly appreci
ated by her.
The rally preliminary to the
Alumni and Freshman games
started auspiciously last evening
with the strains of excellent music
by the band. A good crowd of
University men gathered in the
Encina club room and until about
7:30 dancing was the main amuse
ment. After several numbers by
the band and some practice by the
fellows in the new football song,
"Just Because They Hit That Line
so Hard," a new Freshman yell
was tried and found to be a suc
cess. It goes in this fashion:
Naughty-five! Naughty-five!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Naughty-five! Naughty-five!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Stanford! Stanford! (Slow)
Naughty-five! Naughty-five!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
After this President McCormick
announced that Mrs. Stanford had
unexpectedly arrived on the 5:30
train. It was proposed that all go
over to her residence and greet her.
Almost immediately the fellows
formed in line in front of Encina,
and marching four abreast, headed
by the band, about six hundred
loyal students proceeded to welcome
their benefactress. The procession
wended its way through the silent
arboretum, past the beautiful mau
soleum, where as a mark of respect
all removed their hats and kept
silence.
When the students came to the
home of Mrs. Stanford the music
stopped, and with one accord all
gave the Stanford yell in true spirit
and then " What's the matter with t
Mrs. Stanford." Shortly, amid
cheers from all, the door of the
mansion opened and Mrs. Stan
ford, evidently much affected, ad
vanced to the porch railing and
waved to the boys. She spoke feel
ingly, and won the hearts of all by
what she said:
"1 hardly know what to say to
you. But 1 will tell you how glad
I am to come back again. 1 have
been away a long time. I have
been away a year and a half. I
have seen a great many things and
I have enjoyed a great many things
during mv stay, but the greatest
pleasure of all is to come back to
my dear home again. 1 cannot tell
you how my heart goes out to you,
how much I am gratified to see you,
and to know that you hold me
dear. My only regret is that —
that Mr. Stanford is not here beside
me, to welcome you also. But he
knows; he knows all our joys and
all our sorrows. That is the
thought which keeps me courage
ous, the thought that he is in sym
pathy with all our ambitions. For
that reason we shall try to follow
his wishes, and to carry out what
he planned.
" 1 had hoped that our buildings
would be more nearly finished, but

you know that we have been un
fortunate—we fell into the hands
of the strikers —hut we are not
anxious about the work. It is pro
gressing. I hope that very soon
we can celebrate in another w;iy
the dedication of the Memorial
Chapel. I am interested most of
all in that building. I have
brought back for you a great many
works of art, the most beautiful
which I could find. I want them
to be an object lesson for you. The
walls of the chapel will represent
the history of our Savior. The en
tire beautiful story will be pictured
there for you.
"When I got here this evening, I
took a little run around by the
chemistry [building just to see how
things looked. Although 1 ditl not
treat myself to a visit inside the
new chapel, as i passed behind the
building i heard the sounds of the
new organ, and that seemed to me
a very sweet welcome home.
" I feel very happy and proud
when 1 see you all here —how many
are thereof you? A thousand? [To
a voice from the crowd.] 1 am
very glad there are so many; 1 am
sure the University has grown, in
this crowd of young, active, rising
men, 1 know there are many who
will be great in the future; you
