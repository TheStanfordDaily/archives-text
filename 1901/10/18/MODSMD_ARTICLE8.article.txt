Now that the season of prepara
tion in over, the Daily Palo Alto
feels that it is time to tell the
Freshman football players a secret
it lias been struggling to conceal
for weeks. It is this: Every man
and woman in the University be
lieves, and has believed all along,
that the 1905 eleven is going to
smash Berkeley to smithereens to
morrow. We have not said so be
fore because the attitude of the first
year lads would admit of no such
encouragement. But the overwean
ing conceit manifested early in the
season has disappeared, and we
now have an eleven which in abil
ity and in the spirit that counts as
much as ability is second to none
in Stanford's history. The Univer
sity of California will send forth
the best she has, fired with de
termination to use their last ounce
of strength in fighting for their in
stitution, and encouraged from the
bleachers by a multitude of sup
porters, which will in all probabil
ity far outnumber our own. The
Cardinal players will hear for the
first time the gibes of our rivals,
and this will make them feel, as
nothing else can, that upon them
rests the outcome of the first inter
collegiate match of the year.
Above all else, players and root
ers must bear in mind that a
thoughtless act of roughness or dis
courtesy will discredit the institu
tion in which our pride rents. Stan
ford, in anticipating a game, does
not know, does not use in its
vocabulary, the word defeat. And

yet, failure to gain victory is prefer
able to the slightest breach of the
rules of true sportsmanship. What
ever provocation may arise, we
must remember we are gentlemen.
