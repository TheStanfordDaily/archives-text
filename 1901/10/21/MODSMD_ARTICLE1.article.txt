# FIRST VICTORY SECURE.
## Stanford Freshmen Down Berkeley in a Whirlwind Football Contest.â€”Score II to 5. 
### 
Last Saturday afternoon on the
Sixteenth and Folscm streets
grounds, the Stanford Freshmen,
by a score of 11 to 5, bore their
U. C. rivals down to the hitter dust
of defeat in what was one of the
most spectacular and exciting foot
ball games of the ten Stanford vic
tories. Bleachers and grandstand
were crowded with spectators, 011
the east being the flaunting Blue
and Gold of Berkeley, and 011 (he
west Stanford's chosen Cardinal,
while the two bands crowed at each
other and the rooters yelled and
sang across the dusty field. Neither
side was confident of victory, and
each section of college people was
as tremulous with excitement as
the youngsters who were about to
contend. But the two twenty-five
minute halves were soon over, and
the scarlet-coated Stanford band
led a procession of delirious college
men in a giddy serpentine down
Folsom street to Lark in, up Lark in
to Market, and down Market to the
Palace hotel.
Almost from Kelsey's kick-off to
the last sound of the whistle the
Cardinal fellows had a little the
better of the game; out of 139
downs they had the ball for 77,
and in these plays they netted 564
yards, while the wearers of the
Blue used 62 downs to net 534
yards. Stanford fumbled but twice,
and lost the ball only once. Berk
eley made eight fumbles, losing the
ball four times and losing ground
once, while neither team was held
011 downs. Stanford made her
score by a clever field-goal kicked
by Paul Tarpey from the thirty
yard line, and a thirty-two-yard
run by the same man around Berk
eley's right end after his blocked
kick for field goal; while the small
end of the tally was furnished by
a splendid seventy-two-yard run
I)}' Graves down the field round
Kehrlein's end and past Paul Tar
pey, who was in the back held.
Stanford tried 64 runs, making 242
yards; and 13 kicks, making 315
yards; but Berkeley used only 53
runs and made 263 yards, and 9
kicks and made 278 yards. This
makes the average gain for the
Stanford runs about 4 yards, and
the average distance of the kicks a
little over 24 yards. Berkeley's
runs, on the other hand, made an
average of about 5 yards, and her
kicks were over thirty yards. So,
to the closeness with which the
Cardinal youngsters followed the
ball, to the quick and decisive use
they made of their opportunities,
and to their natural fast-ball in
stinct, must be given the credit for
their success.
In the second half,'Tarpey's re
covery of the ball after a blocked
kick and his running it in for 32
yards and a touchdown, is equalled
only by Cliet Murphy's similar
play four years ago, when, after a
blocked kick he ran it in 90 yards
and almost to the goal line. Stan
ford's best plays were straight
bucks between tackle and guard by
Dole or halfback Tarpey, when the

other backs would form a tandem
with the runner and shoot him
through for several yards at a
play. Her two big gains, one of 22
yards and the other of 32 yards,
both by P. Tarpey, were around
Berkeley's right end. On the whole,
the work done by both teams was
high above the average, and the
Stanford student body lias every
reason to be proud of her '05 team
for their gritty struggle, their
splendid line-smashing, and their
success in what must have been, in
the heat and dust, a terrible tight.

The officials were as follows:
Referee, J. F. Lanagan ; umpire,
Percy Hall; timekeepers, Everett
Brown and Dave Brown; linemen,
John Nourse and Clay, the former
Berkeley tackle.
A few of the details of the game:
Stanford won the toss and took the
northeast goal, which was favored
by the light wind. Kelsey kicked
thirty live yards and Stanford used
Paul Tarpey, Bartell, and Sefton
for fourteen yards, kicking to Cal
ifornia on the fifty-yard line, where
the latter fumbled to Taylor. Sef
ton, halfback Tarpey, Dole, Bartell,
and Dave Tarpey smashed the line
down to Berkeley's eighteen-yard
line, where Bartell fumbled, and
Kelsey scored thirty yards, putting
the ball out of bounds, when it was
brought in as Stanford's ball on
the U. C. forty-eight-yard line.
Using the same men as before Sta
nford made eighteen yards to the
thirty-yard line, where the blue
jerseys held for two downs, and P.
Tarpey kicked the field goal from
Stillinan's hold, leaving the score
5 to 0 in the first ten minutes of
plav. "Rough house" immediately
ensued in the Cardinal section,and
from the fledglings of 1905 to staid
and solemn Archie Rice and Bill
Irwin, the Stanford men went mad.
Bartell ran the sphere in almost
fifteen yards from the Berkeley
kick-off, and Still man made four
and one-half yards, and Bartell
four, but on the next down Wilson
got through and threw Stillman
back six yards, forcing Tarpey to
kick to Wilson, who fumbled to
Taylor. Stanford made twelve
yards, but Tarpey was forced to
punt and Sefton dropped Seltzer
with the ball six yards from the
goal line. Bush punted, the ball
rolling seventy yards before it was
stopped and Tarpey lifted it high
in the air for only five yards, and

California had the ball on the
Stanford forty-five-yard line. Gas
trich, right tackle, made five yards,
Risley, left half, circled right end
for ten, and Kittrell, who took Kel
sey's place at right half, went five
yards around the other end, by a
fumble to Sefton leaving the
ball on Stanford's twenty-tive-yard
line. Paul Tarpey punted to the
center of the field, whence Berkeley
took it by a series of straight bucks
down to the thirty-seven-yard line,
when the whistle blew to end the
half.
Halfback Tarpey kicked off
thirty-five yards, Bush returning
with a punt of thirty after two
downs; Stanford's ball ten yards in
her own territory. On third down
after short gains by Stillman and
Bartell, Paul Tarpey jumped over
left tackle for twenty-two yards to
Saeltzer's tackle. Sefton and Tar
pey brought in seven yards between
them before Stanford's fumble and
recovery by Nissen. Berkeley
braced andTarpey tried for another
field goal, but the ball was stopped
by Wilson, when the kicker picked
it up and sprinted behind Still
man's interference through the line
for thirty-two yards to a touch
down, following it by a successful
trial for goal four minutes after
play was begun in the second half.
Score 11 to 0.
The ball was taken out to the
middle of the held and Bush's
forty-yard kick was run in eleven
yards by Bartell. Stanford punted
and California bucked down to
Stanford's thirty-yard line, where
Risley tried for field-goal, but
missed. The ball was brought out
fifteen yards and Tarpey kicked
fifty yards to Saeltzer, who ran live.
Berkeley began to make better
gains, but fumbled again. Stan
ford bucked eleven yards, using
Dole and Tarpey straight in and
around right end, and Tarpey
kicked, Graves shortly after mak
ing his sensational seventy-two
yard inn. Saeltzer missed the
goal. In the last six minutes of
play Tarpey's forty-yard kick-off
to Saeltzer was followed by a
twenty-yard run; and Graves
came up with another of twenty
live yards. Evans made thirteen
yards round Stanford's left end,
but when Graves was sent against
Kehrlein, the latter broke up the
interference and threw the runner
back eight yards. Bush punted
and Stanford was making short
but steady gains when the half was
over.
