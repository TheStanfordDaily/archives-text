# Nevada Wins from Reliance.
## 
### 
Prohably the best game ever
seen in Nevada was played las!
Saturday at Reno between the Re
liance team and that from the
University of Nevada. The latter
team manifested irresistiblestrength
and decidedly outplayed their op
ponents, especially in the second
half. In the first half Nevada's
try at a place kick failed but was
followed by many aggressive plays
which would have counted had not
Nevada fumbled at critical times.
Toward the end of the first
Kearney, Nevada's right end, ran
the ball seventy yards to a touch
down, and the goal was kicked
In the second half Reliance could
do nothing. Four place kicks were
tried by Nevada and the last one,
from the thirty-yard line,succeeded,
and made the score 110.
