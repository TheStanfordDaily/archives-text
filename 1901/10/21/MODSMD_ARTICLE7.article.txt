Stanford is proud of t-ht» Fresh
man team —proud of e;ich and
every man that played. From Cap
tain Tarpey, with his brilliant in
dividiuil work, to the hardest
pounded lineman, il wan ;t case of
every man doing his duty and
playing ball all the time. Never
for a moment was the old Stan
ford slogan, " Do or die," forgotten.
This shows that the members of the
'05 team not only knew how to
play good football, but that they
have caught that intangible some
thing named "Stanford spirit," a
fine thing for them and for the col
lege.
Yes, it was a beautiful game, and
Stanford has every reason to feel
proud and happy. It is to the
Freshmen, their substitutes, their
second team, and the untiring work
of the coaches that the credit must
go. We are proud of them all, the
team, the subs, the coaches, the
trainer, —proud of the college and
what it stands for. Hut we would
have been just as proud had the
score resulted differently.
The strongest point in the play
ing of our men was their ability to
seize every opportunity instan
taneously. rime and again chances
came for gains, and they were
seized like a flash. The Freshmen
were "up on their toes" all the
while, and there wasn't a minute
that every man of them wasn't in
the game, playing hard, fast,)
winning haII.
Yours was splendid work, j
men, and a splendid victory. You
met every emergency, you arose to)

the occasion, and Stanford salutes
you for it.
