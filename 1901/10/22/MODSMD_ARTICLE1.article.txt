# MORE NEW BUILDINGS
## Work Soon to Commence on Quarters for Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. 
### 
Several new buildings are to he
started as soon as possible on the
campus. The outside part of the
main quadrangle in the rear of the
old quad is to be completed.
These structures will be used as
offices and recitation rooms for the
Mechanical, Electrical, and Civil
Engineering departments. Plans
and specifications will be completed
before long and then we may hope
to see the finishing of the entire
quadrangle. A new Engineering
laboratory will also be started al
most immediately. Its exact loca
tion has not been determined, but
it will probably be west of the pres
ent Civil Engineering building.
The new structures will be one
story high and similar to the pres
ent Engineering one; it will be two
hundred feet long by sixty feet
wide.
The western half will be used for
a steam engineering laboratory
and will contain steam engines and
boilers. The eastern half will be
devoted to experimental electrical
engineering apparatus. As soon
as the Science departments vacate
their present quarters on the old
quadrangle for the new Science
building, they will be used for
drafting and recitation rooms by
the Engineering departments.
When the new laboratories are
completed the present Civil En
gineering building will be changed
into a laboratory for the testing of
materials, and the present Mechan
ical Engineering quarters will be
turned into a machine shop. An
appropriation of $50,000 has been
made to provide for the supplying
of these buildings with the neces
sary equipment for the present. It
is expected that the new Engineer
ing laboratory and the changes in
the old buildings will be completed
by next fall at the opening of the
IJ Diversity.
