The Assembly Hall tomorrow
night should be crowded to the
doors. It is not often that so small
a community has an .opportunity
of hearing such celebrated artists.
The efforts of the Orchestra and
their leader in securing the Italian
Band for one night should receive
recognition. The way this can be
best accomplished is for every
music lover in the community to
show their appreciation by attend
ing the concert.
If people would take more inter
est in the few musicals and con
certs that are given on the campus
by outside professionals, it would
be possible to have many more
good entertainments here. There
is no reason why thi6 should not
be a good place for any one-night
stand. All that is needed is large
and appreciative audiences. No
manager will consent to send his
company to a place where previous
troupes have been disinterestedly
received. Repeated frosts will
surely make this an isolated com
munity as far as high imported
talent is concerned. Everyone can
assist in making Stanford a desir
able point for every high-class
company that tours the West by
attending the concert tomorrow
night, and thus establishing a rep
utation.
