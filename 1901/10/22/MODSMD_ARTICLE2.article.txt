# New System for Library.
## 
### 
The University Library is soon
to add to the present index method
a system of listing the hooks by
subjects, which will enable the stu
dent to find all the books in the
Library on a certain subject by
simply running over the numbers.
The work of cataloguing all the
books by departments will require
some time; however, the different
subjects are to be placed in use as
soon as they are completed. The
Department of History is now com
plete and awaits the arrival of the
cases from the East before it will
be put into use
The cataloguing system of the
Library, which was adopted this
year, is that known as the Deoi
mal System. It consists of a
scheme of units ranging from 0 to
100, and sub-divisions are made
by decimals. This system is an
old one and very practical, and was
adopted because the growth of the
Library made it necessary to de
vise some scheme of increasing the
index numbers. The only incon
venience in the new system is that
it makes larger figures for the
shelf mark.
