# Football in Southern California.
## 
### 
The Los Angeles Athletic Club,.
under the. management of Jack
Sheehan, '95, expects a game with
Stanford during the Christmas hol
idays. The only objection so far j
has been from Stanford, according
to the Los Angeles Express, "to the
fact that many local teams are
made up of crude but husky play
ers whose knowledge of football is
confined to the salary feature, j
Purity in athletics is the aim of
most colleges, and the director of
Stanford sports is a stickler on this
point."
The Los Angeles team will
be made up mostly of old Univer
sity men. Phil Wilson,ex-'Ol, will
probably captain the team. The
team is also making arrangements
for games with Reliance, Olympics,
and Berkeley,
Phil Wilson is coaching Occi
dental College and the Los Angeles'
high school teams.
There has always been competi
tion among the Southern California
teams for the football champion
ship, and considerable rivalry be
tween the different high schools
and colleges. The season com
mences in September and ends on
New Year's Day. The most in
tense rivalry exists between Pomo
na College and the University of
Southern California. Occidental
College has hardly been a feature
in football circles since she won
the championship in '95, nor
Throop Polytechnic since winning
in '96. The Los Angeles, Santa
Ana, San Bernardino, Riverside,
Pasadena, and San Diego high
schools, and the Santa Barbara
Athletic Club generally put up
good teams, and each year one of i
them either wins out or runs a close j
race for the championship. Ibis,
year Pomona College, which won
the championship last year, has |
not as strong a team as formerly, j
The Santa Ana high school team,
which came nearest defeating Po
mona last year, has its old team
again this season. The Los Ange
les high school, under the coaching
of Phil Wilson, is playing a rattling
good game. The Los Angeles Ath
letic Club team, to be organized ,
mainly for a. meet with one of the
northern teams, should outclass I
any other team in thesouth. Other
teams are out and hard at work
and indications point to a season |
full of close, hard-fought games.
