# VARSITY PRACTICES.
## Slight Improvement in Work, but Many Men Crippled on a Poor Field. 
### 
Recent practices of the football
squad have shown a slight im
provement over the earlier work of
the season except in the snappiness
of the play, and for this the ab
sences of Raitt and Bansbach have
not been entirely responsible. The
players put into these positions
have been good men, and they
have had much of the vigor and
hustle which has always character
ized Stanford's best field-captain,
and which has been noticeable to a
high degree in Bansbach. Both
these men will, however, be out for
practice tonight, while Freshmen
Bartell and Paul Tarpey will be
tried for sub-quarter. The slow
ness of the practices as well ms the
unusual number of sprains,
smashed knees, and bruised limbs,
which have fallen to the lot of the
squad this season, are in large
measure due to nothing but the
miserable condition of the football
field. There is hardly a man on
the first, team who is not suffering
from sprains or bruised and raw
knees, hands, or arms, while every
man has had more than his share
of injuries in the past, and some
are going out of practice every
night with wmie such injury.
Fo< tball men can be recognized by
their limp as far as I hey can be
seen. Hardly a man dares plunge
as he should in a tackle, and each
seems afraid to use all his speed in
a run. Through hurt knees the
team has lost much excellent prac
tice, while last night the lield was
so wet that the men could hardly
11m on it. The roller has never
been put on the field and it is said
that the college authorities will not
allow its use there. It is not known
whether Mrs. Stanford has been
asked for permission to use the
machine; if she were, she could
hardly refuse it.
Only two Freshmen wore canvas
last night, Monzingo and Dole, and
the latter was putin as fullback on
the second team, where he played
his usual good game. Nearly all
the 1905 players will be out to
night, however, and of these sev
eral have played up to Varsity
form, notably among them being
Van Sickle, who in Saturday's
game sifted through the line and
did much more damage than was
apparent to the grandstand. Still
man's holding of the ball for Tar
pey's place-kick cannot be too
highly praised, and the halfback's
kicks were made by it nearly twice
as good as heretofore.
On the Varsity the greatest im
provement has been in Traeger,
who has come out better in de
fensive and offensive work than
ever before. Last night, Roosevelt,
at left guard, took in every piny on
that side the line in Varsity form.
The game reported to be sched
uled for tomorrow with a team of
college men managed by Sheehan
of Los Angeles has silently slipped
away with less to show for it than
for the ill-fated alumni game.
Nobody seems to know anything
about Sheehan's team, or whether
it will or will not play.
