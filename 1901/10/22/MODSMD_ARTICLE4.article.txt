# TOMORROW NIGHT'S CONCERT
## The 						Royal Italian Band, Its Organization and Membership. 
### 
The Royal Italian Band, which
will hold a concert in Assembly
Hall tomorrow night, was organ
ized a year ago in Boston, the
players being all brought direct
from Italy. It was re-organized
last summer and the number in
creased by Manager Ellery to fifty
five. The first three engagements
since its reorganization were at the
Steel I'ier in Atlantic City; at Wil
low Grove Park in Philadelphia,
and at the Pan-American Exposi
tion, where it was one of the bands
having a full engagement. The
band, and its leader, Signor Creat
ore, won the highest praises at all
of these engagements, and in Phil
adelphia they received an ovation
from fifty thousand people. Cre
atore has, it is said, all the dash
and vigor of Sousa, but much more
sympathy and feeling. He is one
of the few men who can interpret
complex and difficult music so as
t« render it simple and easy of
comprehension.
The band is composed entirely, it
may be remarked, of instrumental
soloists, and in the sextet six solo
ists appear in one number. The
two most notable members of the
band, aside from the conductor, are
the harp-soloist, Miss Heintzen, an
American girl from Detroit, and
Madame Barili, the soprano, also
an American, although of Italian
parentage.
The advance sale of seats this
afternoon at five o'clock was past
the 800 mark. It promises. to reach
1000 before tomorrow night.
