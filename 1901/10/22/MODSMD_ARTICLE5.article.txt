# Plug Ugly.
## 
### 
The preliminary rehearsals of
the Junior Plug Ugly have been
passing off with a great deal of
success. Those who have been se
lected for the cast have their lines
memorized and the *tage business
well up.
However, the success of the Plug
Ugly depends for the most part on
the members of the Class of'o3 who
do not have speaking parts. They
are the ones who have to supply
the great body of the Plug Ugly.
The speaking parts are only used
to give them an opportunity to ex
hibit their ability in " rough house."
Each man can help to make the
Plug Ugly a success. So it cannot
be urged too strongly upon each
member of the class to take the
greatest personal interest. He
should obtain copies o\ the songs
and memorize them. He should
see that his friends do likewise.
There will be a general rehearsal
Thursday night in the Encina
gymnasium at 7:30. Every Junior
should come and find out what is
expected of him on Friday night.
Naughty-three has never attempted
anything thus far without success,
so let us not fail on the Plug Ugly.
The matter of costumes will be dis
cussed Thursday niuht. Juniors
will be told what make-up is nec
essary. C. W. Thomas,
Stage manager.
