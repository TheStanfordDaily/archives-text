# STOCK FARM.
## Blue Ribbon Sale a Marked Success Future Prospects. 
### 
Work at the Stock Farm is at its
quietest stage. There are on the
farm seven horses over four years
of age. Of the remainder, fifty-one
are yearlings, sixty geldings, and
seven stallions. Under the direc
tion of Mr. Covey a few are heing
broken to harness, a few ;ire heing
worked on the track, with prospects
of development, and the rest are
running in the paddocks.
The sale of hrood-inares, twenty
four in number, held at the State
Fair at Sacramento on September
13th was even more successful than
had been expected.
The blue-ribbon sale held at
Cleveland in May was not quite as
successful, owing to bad weather
and the lack of foresight in the
buyers. From a shipper's stand
point the venture was the best ever
made by the Palo Alto dealers.
Mr. Covey and five men accom
panied the horses. They went
through in six days, stopping only
for a short time at Lincoln, Ne
braska. The horses arrived at
Cleveland in tine condition. The
auction itself returned about $15,-
000, averaging for the 48 horses
something over $300 apiece, llow
ellansold for $1,075 and Lison
jero for $825. The least received
for any one horse was $135.
The reputation of the l'alo Alto
farm throughout the East not only
holds its own, but has been ad
vanced during the last year. Some
of the horses of the 1900 and 1901
sales have shown remarkable
ability. Of the 1900 horses Ele
ata has turned out to be a wonder.
She is but a four-year-old, yet has
won six of the eight races in which
she has entered, coming in second
and third in the other two races.
She holds the record for the great
Detroit M.and M. Meet, time 2:08f.
10 lea la sold for $900 in 1900 and
has since won nearly $20,000 for
her owner.
Of the horses sold in May, one
on I)' has started in a race, and
now this one has a record as a
three-year-old of His first
race was at Brighton, where he
won second money, $500. He won
first money at the Hartford Horse
Review, three-year-old stake,
$6,000. lie is credited by Kastern
writers for 2:10 honors.
The blood of Electioneer runs
strong in the veins of the horses
who hold the fastest records for the
year. The fastest of the three
year-olds, four-year-olds, five-year
olds, mares, geldings, and new
performers, are Carrie Bel, and
j Admiral Dewey, 2;14|, Eleata,
Boralina, 2:07, Dolly Dillon,
