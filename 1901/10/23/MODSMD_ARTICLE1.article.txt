# WORKING MEN HARD.
## Football Coaches Are Hammering Varsity into Shape for Big Game. 
### 
The Varsity lias only two more
games before the big contest with
California, and the coaches are
straining every effort to pound (lie
men into shape. Next Saturday
Reliance will be played on the
campus, and on the following Sat
urday the line-up will be against
the University of Nevada. To be
in shape for these games, as well as
for the great intercollegiate match
that comes later, will require the
hardest kind of work from every
man on the squad. The coaches
realize this, and they are trying to
make the men realize it, also.
Last night's practice showed
only too well the effects of the hot
weather on the players. From the
first scrimmage until the close of
the practice the play was slow and
sluggish, marked by the one re
deeming feature of good team work.
For the last two days the men have
got together well and have played
the best they could under the dis
couraging conditions. Raitt was
not out and his absence was no
ticeable. There was an uncertainty
about the passing of the ball and
an apparent lack of knowledge of
the signals. Bansbach was on the
line-up for a few downs, and did
fairly well, being far, however, from
his best. After he went out the
work was ragged, and but little
could lie done.
The most brilliant work of the
afternoon was done by McFadden,
at tackle. The big sophomore ad
vanced the ball furiously, and was
always good for a gain, showing
speed that he hasn't before devel
oped. His work at carrying the
ball was the best done by the team.
Clark, at end, was a close second
when it came to making gains, his
work being of a Varsity grade.
Fisher and Hill behind thelinedid
fairly well, their principal fault
being a failure to block the end
when the other half was carrying
the ball. On nearly every end
play the man was stopped back of
the line by the end. At center
there was a lively contest on be
tween Lee and Mauverman, the big
Varsity man getting a shade the
better of it. Roosevelt and Barn
hisel did great work at guard,
"Barney" especially plowing big
holes time after time. Of the sec
ond team, Kennedy's work was es
pecially notable. He bucked well,
hitting the line hard, but a trifle
high for the best gains; while on
the defensive his work was strong
and heady.
Coach Fickert said today in dis
cussing the team's chances that of
all things which it must absolutely
acquire the most necessary is speed.
"Speed we must have," said the
head coach, "and we can't get it
unless the men all come out early,
and at the same time. It is in the
preliminary practice before the
line-up that speed is acquired, and
the men must come out early to get
this practice. The work of the last
two days need not be discouraging,
as the hot weather and the shaken
tip condition of the team have been
largely responsible."
