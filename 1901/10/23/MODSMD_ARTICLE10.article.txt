Up to thin lime the Library lias
been very lenient regarding the use
of books. The reference room has
this year been favored more than
ever before with a large number of
text and reference books, and only
lately has it become necessary to
make rules restricting their use.
The restriction means simply that
students have not appreciated the
privileges offered them. The Li
brary management is trying to ac
commodate students in every way
possible, and it is the business of
each one of us to see that we do not
abuse our privileges.
