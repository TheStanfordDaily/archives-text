Less than ii score of Stanford's
loyal adherents have ordered root
ers' hats for the big game. It
would seem entirely unnecessary
for us to call attention to the fact
that all orders for red hats must be
in before next Thursday, that it
will be almost impossible to ob
tain them after that, and that un
less the men of the University
''loosen up" to the extent of sixty
cents, the Stanford side of the
bleachers will be draggled and dis
reputable, when it should glow
with the chosen cardinal. Berk

eley men are investing liberally in
the bine and gold hats and are al
ready registering for rooter-section
tickets. No Stanford man ought
to neglect this duty.
