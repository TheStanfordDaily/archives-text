# ON CO-EDUCATION.
## Several Professors Express Their Views on This Subject in a City Paper. 
### 
How does co-education work?
This question was answered by
some of the prominent professors
in Stanford and the University of
California in the San Francisco
Chronicle of October 20th. Fol
lowing are extracts from the article
published:
Dr. David Starr Jordan has all
along been one of the strongest ad
vocates of the double system in the
higher education. He says:
"I believe most thoroughly in
co-education as the best condition
of higher education in the United
States.
"I believe in the higher educa
tion of woman as the best means of
development of the best homes.
"I believe that the woman edu
cated with men is likely to have
sounder ideas of work and a clearer
perception of tilings as they are
than one educated by or among
women only.
"I believe that men educated
with women are likely to develop
better personal habits and finer
tastes than those who are monas
tically educated, meeting either no
women at all or else only on the
inferior plane of social functions.
" I believe that just now we are
feeling a slight wave'of opposition
to co-education. I do not think
that it will last, for it has no sound
foundation. I do not hold the un
dergraduate opposition to co-edu
cation in much respect. The best
students rarely take part in it and
it seems to have no deeper founda
tion than the fact that the presence
of women checks hazing, rushing,
'beer-bouts,' and other time-dishon
ored customs. Besides, women
count for nothing in athletics or
college politics, and to that class of
students football victories and col
lege politics are things to be taken
seriously. 1 believe in college ath
letics most thoroughly and enthu
siastically, but 1 believe that they
should be in every way subordinate
to the educational functions of a
college.
"I believe that no college has
ever injured its standard or its use
fulness by admitting women; that
no young man was ever less worth
ily educated because women were
in his class, and that no young
woman of character ever suffered
because she was educated with
men.
"In my judgment there is no
problem of co-education. It is long
since settled wherever it has been
tried."
Professor Nathan Abbott, head
of the Law department, is an oppo
nent, not so much of co-education,
as of the whole system of higher
education for women.
Professor Abbott says:
"My impression is that the
whole business is a mistake. In
fact, I do not believe much in the
modern system of educating women.
1 think that they are generally
over-educated. The tendency is to
spoil a good woman to make a poor
man out of her."
Professor Pease, of the Latin de

partment, is an advocate of co-edu
cation. He says:
"Having taught in a man's col
lege, in a woman's college, and now
in a co-educational university, I
have no hesitation in saying that,
as a whole, co-education works
well. There is no denying that in
a woman's college, as in a convent,
there is a false idea about men, a
disposition to go to pieces at the
sight of a mustache. Men and
women live together in the world,
and co-education is the more nat
ural way. In this University and
others of its class women learn to
know men as they really are.
"For the men, the results are just
as good. The tendency, where they
are educated alone, is to rudeness
and roughness of manner. There
is little of tiiat in colleges where
they are educated together."
Dr. Stillnian, head of the Depart
ment of Chemistry, agrees with
Professor Pease in the essentials.
Dr. Stillnian says:
"It works well. The young
people of both sexes are benefitedâ€”
the girls are less silly about men
and the boys are more courteous.
Of course, there are exceptions, but
just about enough to prove the
rule."
