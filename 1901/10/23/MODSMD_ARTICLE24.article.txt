# Odd Proposal of Berkeley.
## 
### 
John Sheehan received a com
munication Saturday from Coach
Decoto of the Berkeley football
team in which he states that the
University of California team
gladly would play a game with a
Los Angeles aggregation if the
contest with Stanford November
9th resulted in a victory for Ber
keley. This way of arranging a
game will receive much adverse
comment among the football en
thusiasts throughout the State, as
it places the State institution in the
position of not wanting to play
football unless they can win â€”Los
Angeles Express.
