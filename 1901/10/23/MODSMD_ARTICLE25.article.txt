Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I notice by a recent edition of
your valued paper that 1 am in the
employ of the Bureau of Irrigation.
Doubtless Mr. Green and the lire
department will believe this and
wisely shake their heads and hold
my name up to erring freshmen in
the light of a horrible example
showing to what, lengths the irri
gating habit will lead one. Doubt
less they think 1 have had enough
field work —or they might say May
field work — to qualify as an ex
pert irrigator. I hasten to disap
point them and beg leave to assure
you that 1 have not been irrigating
at all lately.
Do me the honor to nail this
canard and bring my traducer to
justice. It is Frank "Chronicle"
Adams who has the irrigation po
sition of which you speak. Several
times heretofore lie has known the
misfortune of bearing a surname
identical with mine, —but he may
live it down in time.
1, alas! have no government po
sition, but am still a poor scribe,
yet bear the proud and I may say
unique position of being one of
"the four" —the only four in the
city who are not working—l mean
working for —the government. The
last part of your item is correct; I
am writing for the magazines, but
none of their vast army of readers
is yet aware of it.
Hoping you may yet do the
other Mr. Adams justice, I remain
Very sincerely yours,
Bristow Adams.
