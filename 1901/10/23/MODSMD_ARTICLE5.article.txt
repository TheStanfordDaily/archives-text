# New Library Rule.
## 
### 
The Library has adopted a new
rule which reads as follows: "Mem
bers of the University are expected
to return books to the desk as soon
as they are through using them.
Books for which there may be con
siderable demand shall be retained
by the reader not longer than a
single hour, but may be renewed if
not called for by others."
