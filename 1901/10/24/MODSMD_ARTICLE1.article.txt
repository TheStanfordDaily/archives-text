# UNLESS IT RAINS
## The
						Fires of Hades Will Give Light for the Dedication of the Junior Plug. 
### 
Unless Providence interposes a
shower to quench the branch fires
of hades, the Junior Plug will be
dedicated tomorrow evening as the
emblem of the Class of 1903. The
Plug Ugly performance, now an
established annual custom, is
scheduled to begin at the oval
shortly after 8 o'clock. Satan will
be there, Moloch will be there,
Beelzebub will be there, and all the
black, horned tribe, cast out of the
Kingdom of Soph., will come
through the fires in search of deliv
erance from their anomalous situa
tion. If the blazing regions do not
prove so hot as to cause unpleasant
suggestions, the Daily Palo Alto
will probably appear as a witness
to the performance —nothing will
be lacking to make the setting real
istic.
By the invocation of thunder
and earthquakes, Satan will assert
his authority over the rebellious
tribe, quelling all rebellion and
proving himself absolute master of
the situation. Real, live devils —
some of whom have never before
been recognized by the faculty
committee — will be revealed in
their true color, swimming out from
the seething lake of molten brim
stone; while others, proving them
selves unworthy of the journey in
search of the far-off, longed-for
land of promise, will be summarily
hurled back. At last, after sedi
tion and rebellion, strife and "rough
house," a sample of the magic em
blem, by which wearers gain ad
mission to the promised Land of
Plug, is brought forth at the sacri
fice of a well known canine belong
ing to the region round about.
This scene of the sacrifice will be
preceded by a vivisection that will
rival anything ever (.lone in the
physiology laboratory.
Hired and imported "rough
housers" will keep the bleachers in
terested during the intermissions.
Those who go about in Encina in
fear of the Cops will make disturb
ance to their hearts content, for
the Cops will not be brought from
the depths.
Spectators may rest assured that
they will not be contaminated by
the surroundings. In all the up
heavlas of the lake, no explosives
are used which singe any one but
the devils. The payment of the
admission fee exempts every one
from the dangers of the vicinity.
After the legions have donned
their plugs, thus being relieved
from bondage and marching out,
the spectators will be at liberty to
descend into the depths for investi
gation.
