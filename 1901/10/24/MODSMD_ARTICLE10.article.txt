It is deplorable that people who
ought to know better continue to
drive vehicles upon a track in
tended only for men with spiked
shoes. It should not be the duty
of this paper to rail continually at
men and women who are doubtless

in the habit of praising the "Stan
ford spirit," but who chop the
Stanford track to pieces with the
iron shoes of their horses, and who
have probably, with loud words,
regretted the fact we have never
beaten Berkeley on the track. Will
the management take steps to pre
vent people who can not learn bet
ter from mutilating the track any
more?
