# A 						GREAT CONCERT.
## Performance of the Italian Band the Beat Musical Treat Ever Heard Here. 
### 
A great crowd tilled the Assem
bly Hall last evening to hear the
concert given by Mr. Channing
Ellery's Royal Italian Band, which
was probably the greatest musical
treat that has ever come to us.
Every member was an artistic suc
cess, and the enthusiasm of the
listeners was unbounded.
To attempt a complete critical
discussion of the program would
take more space than can be given
here, but some of the numbers de
serve particular mention. In the
"Tannhauser" overture Signor
Creatore showed his wonderful gen
ius at interpretation, but it was
probably in the " Walkiire" selec
tion that this genius was shown in
the highest degree. It was a reve
lation to most of us that this num
ber could be so satisfactorily given
without the assistance of stringed
instruments. The interpretation
of the motives was not always the
conventional one, but the modifica
tions were always such as to lend
the effectiveness which is one of
Creatore's strong points.
The " Carmen " number was very
dramatically given, Signor Kerul
lo's work on the oboe being partic
ularly noteworthy. In the "Lu
cia" sextet the solo horns made
splendid use of an opportunity to
show their ability. The operatic
numbers as a whole completely vin
dicated Creatore's judgment in
sticking to the original scores in
stead of using more or less mud
dled transcriptions.
Some of our readers may be in
terested to know that the quaint
number played as an encore to the
"Adagio" from the pathetic sonata,
was an old composition dating
from the seventeenth century.
Mine. Barili's singing was very
enjoyable. She has an unusually
sweet and clear, but not overstrong
voice, and it was again evidence of
the efficiency of the band that it
could accompany her in such good
taste and not make itself obtrusive.
Miss Heintzen showed very clever
technique with the harp and the
numbers were thoroughly appre
ciated.
On the whole the concert could
not well have been more of a suc
cess, either artistically or finan
cially. But one is overwhelmingly
impressed with the fact that Cre
atore is the band, and that what
ever the band does, it is because of
Creatore. There may be a little
tendency to smile at first at his
vigorous gesticulation, but it is not
long before one becomes thoroughly
convinced of his absolute earnest
ness. We should be interested to
see what he could do with an or
chestra.
