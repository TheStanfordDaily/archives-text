# ENCINA GYMNASIUM
## Has Been Remarkable Advancement During the Last Five Years. 
### 
The Encina gymnasium has
made remarkable advances in the
last few years. In 181)6 the gallery
was not in use except as a store
room for litter, old apparatus, etc.;
now all the special apparatus is
put there, as well as lockers,
punching hags, and Swedish-horse.
'I*l lis gives room for two handball
courts, and apparatus that has
been stored away is now in place.
A photo-gallery was also putin,
where work was formerly done in
anthropometry. Now the work is
carried on far more extensively
and a laboratory has been added.
From a few pieces the apparatus
has been increased greatly. There
are some twenty-six pieces of ap
paratus, besides two handball
courts, crowded into an inadequate
building. A trapeze was recently
added and four new mats will soon
be put in. Originally there were
from six to eight men in a section.
Now, that each man may receive
special attention and that the
leaders may become more efficient
with fewer men to watch, there are
three men and a leader in each.
The leaders and men are changed
from time to time, to allow men
the benefit of good leaders and the
leaders experience with more men.
As the ordinary student, spending
most of his time indoors and at the
gymnasium, tends to slight the
legs in developing back and
shoulders, outdoor work in base
ball, basket-ball, association foot
ball, and track work, as well as
military drill, have been added to
the work. A few years back the
captain of the team, whether foot
ball, baseball or track, sent in a
list of those who were to receive
credit for gymnasium work. In
this way many men who worked
faithfully failed to receive their
credit. But now accurate records
of all those substituting work are
kept and every man receives credit
for what he does. Special attention
is paid to those who through sick
ness, a weak heart, or other causes,
are not able to take regular work.
Work on special apparatus is as
signed to these men, and many
who were physically unsound have
been built up into robust men.
The gymnasium is the greatest
social factor in the University.
There more men meet on freer and
easier terms than anywhere else.
There they become best acquainted.
Interest in gymnasium work is in
creasing every year. On Saturdays
and before classes many students
may be seen playing handball or
working on the apparatus. Over
half the men in the University are
taking work. There are 385 reg
istered this year, an increase of
thirty over last year.
Many calls come from prepara
tory schools and colleges for ex
perienced men to take charge of
gymnasium work. There are but
comparatively few who can lill
these positions. But those who
have taken regular gymnasium
work here, together with the lead
er's course, for three or four years,
are, for the most part, capable of

taking charge of the gymnasium of
preparatory schools or colleges
which may have such a need. This
is the great practical value of gym
nasium work. It is an educator of
the body, just as academic work is
of the mind. It teaches self-control
and self-assurance, as well as cor
rects physical faults.
The gymnasium has been an im
portant factor in the development
of sports for those who do not care
or are physically unable to enter
intercollegiate sports. In interest
handball stands first. Last spring
a tournament was held in which
many men were entered, and which
excited much outside interest. A
belt was offered as a trophy for the
winner. Almost every day classes
can be seen on the field north of
the gymnasium playing baseball,
basket-ball, and association foot
ball, and to judge from the noise,
having a good time. Shortly there
will be a wrestling tournament.
In view of the great interest
taken in the gymnasium, and the
large number of men taking work,
there are many pressing needs.
Chief among them are a larger
building with a roof that does not
leak, so that there may be more
floor space and so that the students
may have comfortable rooms to
work in; more appartus, that there
may be more variety ; adequate
plunge and shower baths that are
supplied with pure, healthy water
instead of the stagnant, ill-smell
ing liquid now used, and that can
be cleaned thoroughly and not be
come shiny with use; regulation
handball courts, that the students
may learn the regulation game
and be able to compete with other
institutions; and a well appointed
field for outdoor sport, where the
general body of students can take
exercise.
