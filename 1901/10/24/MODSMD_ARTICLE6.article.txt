# VARSITY IMPROVES.
## Good Work Done in Last Night's Practice.â€”Second Team Shows Up Better. 
### 
Last night's practice showed a
slight but noticeable improvement
in the game played by both Var
sity and second teams. While a
number of men are still being tried
out for the various positions on the
big team, the chances are slowly
narrowing down and the first team
men are becoming more accustomed
to working together. The result is
that more team work was displayed
last night than has been showed so
far this season. In runs the inter
ference is much better than hith
erto, and most of the men get in on
a buck in better fashion than
formerly. The team is slowly ap
proaching the stage where every
man will get into every play. One
of the cardinal virtues which
Traeger exhibits is his way of help
ing the other man along. Sefton is
developing the same practice, while
the Varsity backs are now getting
in behind the runner on a buck
and thus helping to hurdle him
through.
In last night's line-up, Kennedy,
in Fisher's place at halfback,
showed up remarkably well. He
is quick in getting around the ends,
reckless in bucking, and he dis
plays much football common
sense. Preston, at Varsity end, is
playing good ball, as is Clark on
the other side, lloosevelt and Hau
vernian, in the center of the big
line, broke through the scrubs'
wall several times; Luck, at tackle,
played a fair game, although he is
a bit light for McFadden's position;
and "Guiby" Dole, opposite him,
put up his usual fast and energetic
play.
The most interesting fight for a
position on the team is at end, for
which Clark, Sefton, Preston, \V.
Dole, Kulin, Wilbur, Luck and
Knight have been tried. The
chances so far seem to be a little
the best for Clark and Sefton,
although all these men have played
good ball. P. Tarpey was put.in
at sub-quarter last night, and,
while slightly unfamiliar with the
position, fumbling some, the Fresh
man seems to have promise of
becoming a good man for the
place. Hansbach's work is steadily
improving, and he is acquiring
speed in giving signals and hustling
up the play. His tackling, too, is
growing better, and his work is en
tirely up to Varsity form.
The bleachers woke up once last
night with the vigorous efforts of
Corbusier for their resuscitation
and went through the yells hastily,
relapsing again, however, into their
accustomed lethargy.
Some people continue to use the
track for driving purposes after the
close of practice.
A yell was introduced 011 the
bleachers this evening which pro
mises to partially fill the want of
good yells that has been so appar
ent. It is an old yell of Princeton,
and goes as follows:
Sky-rocket I !
Siss-s-s-s (hiss)
Boom (short)
Ah ! ! ! (long)
Fickert.
