Training is a prerequisite to ex
cellence in any branch of athletics.
Fall training in track, tennis, and
baseball iw an important factor in
the development of that excellence.
In order to make the best of our
material, systems of fall training
should be instituted in these three
branches of athletics. A few track
and tennis men are doing light
work in their specialties, but noth
ing has as yet been done relative
to perfecting a baseball nine.
The old field has been putin good
condition. A diamond is mapped
out, a back-stop is in place, and all
that is needed is a little enthusiasm
on the part of biiseball players.
We would urge this year's captain
of the Varsity nine to get his men
together two or three times a week
for lively practice in the fine points
of the game.
