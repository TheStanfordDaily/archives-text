Spontaneous yelling during a
game when our side is winning is
better than machine-produced slo
gans. In the preliminary shouting
and in encouragement to the team
at critical moments, however, the
organized rooting section is always
more effective. The spasmodic
effort of the bleachers at practice
last evening was a shout in the
right direction. We must rehearse
more.
