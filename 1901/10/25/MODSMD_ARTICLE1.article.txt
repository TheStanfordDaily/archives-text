Ileliance Club team will be their
opponents, and the contest prom
ises to be hard fought and close
from start to finish. It ought to
draw forth one of the largest and
most enthusiastic crowds of the
season, for not alone are the elev
ens evenly matched and deter
mined to play hard ball, but Stan
ford supporters will have a chance
to get a line on the strength of her
team. And this is a matter of no
small moment to every one who
carries the cardinal.
The last time two teams faced
each other there was no score, and
it was an even battle from the kick
off. If Stanford wins tomorrow, it
will mean that our team is stronger
and better able to make a good
showing in the big game that comes
two weeks later. The men are in
good shape for the game, and will
play all the football they know.
