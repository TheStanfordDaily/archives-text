Track athletics have never
drawn the support that they merit
from the student body. Only
those students who have been
prominent track men in their high
school days take an interest in this
branch. Unless a student has
made a record in some event, he
generally feels backward about ap
pearing on the cinder path, and it
is very seldom that such a one re
ceives any recognition or encour
agement should he presume to at
tempt the development of latent
qualities, if we ever expect to get
out a winning team, there will
have to be a change of sentiment.
We now have an excellent coach
and trainer who is experienced and
enthusiastic in his work. He re
quests every able-bodied man to
get out and train. It is not neces
sary that he should know even
what a track looks like. This is
the advantage of having a trainer.
He can develop a team. Jt does
not need to be. composed of men
who have established records All
that is needed is material, and
there are unquestionably enough
men in the University to furnish
that material. Get out and try.
Nothing is accomplished without
first an attempt. The wearers of
the Stanford "S 1 ' are the heroes
of college days. The opportunity
is before you. Take advantage of
it and appear on the track tomor
row in suits, with the determina
tion of being a Varsity man be
