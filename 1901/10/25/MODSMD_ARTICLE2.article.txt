# Varsity Display Good Team.

### 
Last night on a field a trifle
better than heretofore, the Varsity
lined up for about twenty minutes
against the second eleven, making
three touchdowns to their oppon
ents' none by an almost entirely
bucking game. Many of the regu
lar second eleven men, however,
were absent from the field, and at
least one or two calmly sat on the
bleachers watching the plays he
should have been in. The Varsity
was composed of Hauverman, cen
ter; Thompson and Barnhisel,
guards; Roosevelt and McFadden,
tackles; Clark, Boren, and Preston,
ends; Uaitt, quarter; Fisher, Smith,
and Hill, halves; for awhile Ken
nedy, preceding Slaker, at full
back. Two Freshmen were putin
at the scrub ends, Wilbur and W.
Dole, and both played good ball,
although neither was entirely fa
miliar with the second team sig
nals; "Guilty" Dole, Shields, and
Butterfield were tackles on the
second; Lock wood and Monzingo,
guards; Hayden, center; and Bans
bach and Blodgett, quarter; while
Kuhn and Freshman Smith played
at half, and Parker at fullback.
There were only forty-six downs
in the little time left for play when
all the tardy heroes had dribbled
onto the field, and of these downs
the big team had the ball for
twenty, kicking only three times.
The second team used Parker for
six kicks, making about 1(50 yards
in all, and these were run in by
Raitt, Fisher, and Clark over (30
yards. In the Varsity's three
kicks, Hill made 120 yards, a very
fair average; while in the other

seventeen downs when the big fel
lows bucked or ran the ends, using
Fisher, Hill, Smith, Raitt (after a
recovered fumble), McFadden, W.
Dole, and Slaker, they made 129
yards, an average of almost eight
to the down. The second team
made no gain, or were pushed
back, in .seventeen of their downs,
and in the other three made five
yards.
Taken all in all the Var
sity's showing last night was much
better than heretofore, and, while
it is undoubtedly true that the
second team was in a slump owing
to the absence of several good men,
the dash, enthusiasm, and spirit
shown by the Varsity players was
noticeable and infectious. They
played better, faster ball and kept
it up in a heavy, steamy atmos
phere better than at any previous
practice. There was much more
team work shown, especially on
some of Slaker's bucks, which be
fore this he has made almost un
supported by the backs, and on end
runs, when the interference played
ten-pins with the (ield. Slaker's
bucks of the line were, with his
new support, brilliant and spec
tacular successes, and last night,
for almost the first time this season,
the famous back received the yell,
which his hard and careful work
has often merited. Fisher is im
proving some, and last night he put
to his credit a good tackle of Hans
bach, two fifteen-yard runs around
right end, and a thirty-yard sprint
around the same end for a touch
down. Boren, who was out after a
three weeks' absence with a bad
knee, played almost up to his old
form, and dropped Bansbach in a
splendid tackle as the latter was
running in a kick from Hill. It
was noticeable that two fumbles
were chalked up against the Var
sity, in one of which the ball was
lost; while in the other it was re
covered only by the ' little big"
man Raitt, who with his usual
football instinct picked up the
sphere and ran with it five yards
before be was tackled.
Last night with the hiss of a new
yell the somnambulistic bleachers
woke up and cheered in the real
old way. Besides the "Sky-rocket"
yell, another was tried, which runs,
"Your yell is keen, but it needs
more steam, Berkeley. (Jo way
back and lie down!" The Varsity
yell is being given more sharply
and with more distinct "rahs" than
has been true of late before.
The Varsity will play a team
made up of Olympic men and the
Stanford coaches next Tuesday,
October 29th, at 4 p.m., on the
campus. The officials and the two
linemen will be published next
week.
