# FROM THE PHILIPPINES.
## Letter from W.J. Woods, '01, Tells of His Experiences in the Schools of Pandan. 
### 
An interesting letter was re
cently received by G. Leistner, '04,
from W. .). Wood, '01, who now
holds an important position in th£
schools of the Philippines. Some
extracts from the letter, dated
at Pandan, Pa nay, are here quoted:
Well, i have arrived at my
station at last. 1 got here on
August Bth, on horseback, wet
through, after fording several
rivers. My trunk did not come
until a day or two ago. Am quar
tered with a Filipino family; the
house was used as headquarters by
the Filipino army and later by the
American army. The head of the
family was one of evanescent
Aguinaldo's colonels. 1 eat alone,
for the natives eat on the floor
without knives or forks. Their
fare consists of dry, un sal ted rice
and stale fish. But mine, on the
other hand, is that of an Oriental
gentleman. Imagine me, if you
can, sitting beside a table heavy
laden with a two-course dinner.
By my side stands my valet fan
ning me and scaring flies. Another
native "slings" the potatoes and
another does the culinary "stunts."
A dinner consists of a baked fish, a
la Biscay; there are four courses of
chicken —chicken soup, chicken
boiled, chicken fried, and chicken
eggs. On the side will be green
peas, asparagus, Van Camp's beans,
blackberry jelly, all from the com
missary department. The dessert
consists of tropical fruits, mangoes,
pineapples, bananas, etc. The fav
orite drink is tuba, a vine that
grows from coeoanut trees; and last
of all conies a box of cigars,—
everybody smokes here. So you
see that I am living very well.
That valet of mine is the "limit."
He is a big, husky fellow, just
grown. 1 got him not because J
needed him, but because all white
men of standing keep them here.
He knows neither Spanish nor
English. I pay him $2 per month
and he is on duty all the time.
Pandan is on the northwest
coast of Panay. The town has
from 10,00U to 15,000 people.
Besides fifteen white soldiers I am
the only white man here. I have
charge of about eighteen schools
with a large one of 300 pupils in
the middle. Most of my time is
spent in this large school trying to
teach both pupils and teachers
English. I have one white assist
ant, a soldier, and expect to have
another white man soon.
The people here know very little
Spanish —only a few, in fact, can
speak it. The children know noth
ing but Visayan, a language con
sisting mostly of grunts and signs.
In the evenings, three times a week,
I teach the business men, thirty
live in all.
There are good chances here to
make big money in speculation,
buying and selling the products,
rice, hemp, etc.
My health here has been pretty
good and 1 believe I am going to
escape the diseases of the tropics.
We don't get much news here.
Mail does not come oftener than
once a month. 1 have not seen a
newspaper for a month.
