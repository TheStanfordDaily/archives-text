Herbert C. Hoover, '95, returned
from China last Wednesday and is
on the campus today. He has a
brilliant record as a mining engi
neer and expert, and is said to be
the highest salaried man for his
years in the world, receiving $33,000
a year. Hoover worked his way
I through the University, graduating
with the Pioneer Class. Soon after
leaving the University he went to
Coolgardie in Western Australia,
and was for two years in charge of
rich properties of a London syndi
cate, at a salary of $15,000 a year.
Later he went to China for another
syndicate on a salary of $20,000,
and recently he has been receiving
I $33,000 a year.
i Hoover is on his way from Tein-
ITsin lo London, where he has just
been called to be a junior partner
in the firm of Bewick, Moreing A
Co., perhaps the most noted mining
syndicate in the world.
Mr. Hoover spent three years ex
ploring China, and says there is no
gold in China worthy of explora
tion, but that the country is the
richest in the world in coal. Act
ing in behalf of the Board of Mines of
the Chinese government, Mr.
Hoover and his assistants spent
two years in the exploration of
Chihli, Shantung and Shansi prov
inces and Manchuria looking es
pecially for precious metals. He
says that the country has been
mined for over one thousand years.
