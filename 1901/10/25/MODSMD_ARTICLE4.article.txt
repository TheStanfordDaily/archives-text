# FALL TRACK TRAINING.
## A 						Local Handicap Meet Will be Held Later to Develop Material. 
### 
It is certainly to be regretted
that more men have not taken ad
vantage of the opportunity which
they possess to go into active train
ing under Mr. Moulton's direction.
There is, without doubt, more in
terest being manifested in track
team work this year than ever
before in the history of University
athletics; yet there are not enough
candidates out. Everyone should
show his loyalty to his University
by coming out.
Mr. Moulton says:"I have often
found in raw material first-class
men, and there is no reason why I
should not find them now."
We cannot hope to develop a first
class track team in two months.
Thus it is that fall work, although
light, is absolutely essential to suc
cess. Arrangements have been
made whereby all deserving candi
dates will be properly fitted out
with spikes, etc. The question
which was "Why do we not have a
winning track team?" has changed
to 41 Wby don't you take an active
part?"
A little later a local handicap
meet will be held on the oval, and
every student should signify his
willingness to attain success by
taking part. Tomorrow all track
candidates are requested to meet
on the oval, in suits, from 9 to 11
a.m. If raining, Mr. Moulton will
meet the candidates in the gym
nasium at 10:30.
