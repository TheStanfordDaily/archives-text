# ANOTHER PLEDGE.
## Sophomores Promise to Remain Away from Plug Ugly Unless Admitted Free. 
### 
A large and enthusiastic meeting
of the Sophomore Clans was held
today in the chapel. The minutes
were read, and F. A. Ford gave the
results of consultation of the com
mittee on hats. He showed two
hats and two caps as samples. A
motion made by E. E. Miller to
choose a cap, was lost. F. P. Hans
bach made a motion that a felt hat
be adopted, and it was carried. A
motion made by VV. F. Dunn to
adopt one of the hats presented was
lost. President Thomas appointed
a committee to select a hat, on the
motion of I. Russell to that effect.
The committee consists of Miss
Reynolds, Miss Bean, Miss Bartruff,
Miss Waldo, and H. M. Lewis, W.
F. Dunn, L. P. Bansbach,and F. A.
Ford, chairman. A motion to ad
journ was lost. The question of
eligibility for wearing the hat was
then raised. It was moved and
carried that those who entered last
Christmas should not be eligible
unless they had taken part in some
class activity.
A pledge was unanimously taken
not to pay any admission to the
Plug Ugly this evening. Everyone
was confident that the gentlemen
0f.'03 would return the compliment
of (he Sophomores for not smash
ing plugs by giving them free ad
mission. It will be interesting to
note how many members of the
1904 class break this promise.
