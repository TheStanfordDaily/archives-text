# STANFORD AGAIN VICTORIOUS.
## Fairly Outplayed the Reliance Team Saturday Afternoon With a Score of I0 to 0. 
### 
Saturday afternoon, in one of the
hardest fought games of the season,
the Stanford football team defeated
an eleven from Reliance Club by
the score of 10 to 0. The home
team made its tally by a touch
down in the first three minutes of
play and by Traeger's place-kick
from the thirty-yard line late in
the second half. The game was
one of possibilities from the very
first, and Stanford's score does not
by any means show the excellent
work her men did throughout the
entire contest. Hut for a run of bad
luck the score would have been '28
to 0 instead of what it is. Twice in
the first half the Cardinal team
bucked the ball up to within one foot
of their opponents' goal-line, only to
fail to score; once by Hill's fumble,
and once by the call of time to end
the half. The third thwarted at
tempt was by Fisher in the last
half, when behind good interference
he ran clear across the field and
around right end for a touchdown,
which was not allowed. The Car
dinal players were penalized fifteen
yards because Reliance's right end
was held. An unsuccessful at
tempt for field goal from the
twenty-two-yard line was tried by
Traeger about the middle of the
second half, but it was blocked by
Reliance's captain, Hamilton.
Out of one hundred and three
downs Stanford had the ball for
seventy-six, and she used eleven of
these for kicks by Hill and Fisher,
the former averaging forty-six
yards and the latter a little less
than thirty yards to a punt. The
sixty-one runs made by the home
team aggregate two hundred and
fifty-five yards, an average of a
little over four yards to the run.
Moreover, seven of Reliance's kicks
were run in by Stanford, Raitt
making six runs of forty-eight
yards in all and Ransbach one of
fifteen. Four of Stanford's downs
were without gains. However, the
Varsity has on the other side of
the account five fumbles: one by
Fisher to Barnhieel's recovery; one
by Traeger, and one by Hill, both
of which were lost ; a double
fumble in the second half to
Kuhn's recovery ; and one by
Fisher to Traeger's recovery.
Reliance had the ball for only
twenty-seven downs, in thirteen of
which the club men kicked, their
punts gaining in all three hundred
and forty yards, an average of
twenty-six yards to the punt. They
ran with the ball fourteen times
and were stopped six limes with no
gain, making an entire gain by
runs of twenty-two yards. Piatt
has to his credit two fine runs
from catches of Hill's kicks, one a
twenty-yard dash and the other of
fifteen yards to Barnhisel's tackle.
Kuhn stopped Zan once and Piatt
once after their catches of Fisher's
kicks, both without gain. The
visitors fumbled but twice, once to
Boren and once to Thompson.
They gave up the ball once on
downs, and on off-side play they

were penalized ten yards. The
only important bucking gain they
made was early in the first half,
when McNevin hit center for eight
yards. The fierce game played hy
the Varsity team put left guard
"Pete" Smith, whose shoulder had
been hurt, out of the game in a few
minutes, badly damaged Piatt, At
kinson, and Wilson, and gave
right guard Weirs, for whom there
was no substitute, an almost use
less leg, with which, however, he
pluckily kept on playing.
After Traeger's thirty-three-yard
kick, the Oakland men fumbled to
Boren, and Stanford used Slaker
for ;i five-yard gain through center,
Hill for three yards on right end,
Traeger for seven yards on the
same side, McFadden in almost
the same play for the same dis
tance, Slaker for five yards between
left guard and tackle, and the
same man through center for the
touchdown, Reliance hardly having
had the ball. Time, 3 minutes 5
seconds.
Raitt took in Percy's kick for
five yards, Fisher went straight in
for the same distance, fumbling to
Barnhisel, and Hill kicked forty
yards to Piatt, who brought it
twenty yards back. McNevin made
eight yards, Wilson four, and the
same men made three and one-half
yards between them before they
were held on downs. Hill made
eleven yards around Scheef's end,
but Traeger fumbled to Wilson,
Reliance soon after fumbling to
Thompson. Hill ran the right end
for ten yards, Fisher went straight
in for five, and Traeger, McFadden,
and Slaker followed with steady
gains until Reliance held and Hill
kicked, Percy, after two fruitless
downs, returning the favor. Using
the same men as before Stanford
bucked thirty-nine yards, to within
one yard of the goal-line, where
Hill fumbled. Percy kicked out,
and Stanford bucked it back again
to within a foot of the line, when
time was called.
Hill kicked forty-five yards to
Piatt, who made fifteen yards to
Kuhn's tackle. Reliance then,
making no gain, kicked to Raitt,
who ran it in five yards. Hill
kicked sixty-five yards out of
bounds, caught Reliance's return
kick and ran it in ten yards, in the
same down kicking twenty yards to
Collins. Reliance kicked to Raitt,
who made fifteen yards. Traeger
and Slaker made twenty-four yards
between them and Hill kicked
thirty-five yards, Reliance losing
ten yards on off-side play. Stan
ford bucked up to the fifteen-yard
line, when by a fifteen yard run
Fisher made a touchdown, which
was not allowed. Stanford bucked
the line for eighteen yards and
Traeger tried for a field goal,
Fisher recovering the blocked kick
near Ihe middle of the field. Fisher
kicked, Percy returned it, and after
a series of steady gains Traeger
kicked a successful field goal from
the thirty-yard line.

After a few uneventful plays
time was called with the ball near
the center of the field.

Without a question of doubt
Stanford owes her victory to the
splendid team work of her men, to
the increased solidity of her line,
to the excellent interference given
her runners, and to the line indi
vidual work done by every man on
her team, but especially by Slaker,
Raitt, Fisher, Traeger, McFadden,
Hill, and Kuhn.
