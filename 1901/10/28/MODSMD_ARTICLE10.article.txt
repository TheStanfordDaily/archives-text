Saturday's gamk deserves worthy
comment. It was a fast, snappy
contest from start to finish, and,
barring a streak of hard luck, the
score would have been doubled.
The wt>rk of our team has im
proved wonderfully. Every indi
vidual member of it deserves some
praise. The work of the coaches
is largely responsible for this im
provement. The rooters showed
the proper spirit by giving the visi
tors encouragement as well as
cheering their own representatives.
Such an attitude is commendable.
However, the Varsity has room
for improvement. Its playing is
far from perfect. And the bleach
ers need some incentive to make
them get together better in their
yells, which showed considerable
weakness at Saturday's game.
Only two weeks remain for practice
preliminary to the final tussel on
the ninth. Every member of the
football squad, as well as each in
dividual in the bleachers, must j
work harder than ever before if we
wish to outplay and outyell Berke
ley on that date.
