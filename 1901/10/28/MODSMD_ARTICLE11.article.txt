Students, faculty members, and
football spectators in general will
recognize the advantage of a second
gate to the football field. Many
rooters, indeed, have spoken of the
present inconvenience incident on
the departure of a few hundred
people from the bleachers, and
have mentioned a double exit as a
remedy. Innumerable others have
heartily concurred in the sugges
tion. At present, with only one
gate through which football play
ers, who are generally tired and

dirty, and spectators, all in a
hurry to get away, must pass on
in order to leave the grounds, con
siderable delay, inconvenience, and
trouble is experienced. This was
especially noticeable last Saturday
after the game with Reliance
when the visiting players, who had
only a limited time in which to
catch their train, climbed over the
fence around the gridiron to avoid
the rush and delay they would
otherwise have experienced at the
one exit. A second gate, while in
expensive, would be a great con
venience to all concerned.
