J. G. de Forest, ex-'Ol, left guard
on the '99 and '00 Varsity, and
former business manager of the
Daily Palo Alto, was on the quad
today and will probably register
for work at once.
in an interview with a Palo
Alto representative de Forest
told an interesting story of life at
Nome,'where he has been since last
May with an expedition from the
U. S. Geological Survey at Wash
ington, 1). C. The party, which in
cluded about twelve scientists,
made an accurate survey of the en
tire Nome peninsula, and the whole
period of the expedition was spent
in the wilds of Alaska beyond the
confines of civilization. The party
hardly saw a white man during
their whole trip.
The same party will undoubtedly
make a survey of the Philippines
next summer, and de Forest will be
a member of the party.
