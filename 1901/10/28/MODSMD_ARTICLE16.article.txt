# ”NEW IMPERIALISM."
## First of Four Lectures on the International Political Situation. 
### 
Dr. Paul S. Reinsch, of the chair
of political science at the Univer
sity of Wisconsin, lectured in the
chapel this afternoon, on the sub
ject "The New Imperialism." This
is the tirst of a series of four lec
tures to deal with different aspects
of the international political situ
ation.
Beginning with a reference to the
change which has come about in
our colonial notions, the speaker
showed how the statesmen of today
are all advocates of a colonial sys
tem.
The course of political evolution
was outlined by Dr. Reinsch as a
growth through live successive
stages of government. Thus the
earliest condition is one of purely
agricultural industry where royalty
has been established by military
leadership. In a feudal society ap
pear castes, or dominant families,
whose rule is based on an estimated
ability in religious, military, or in
tellectual pursuit, and in the polity
or city state are found a number
of freemen with equal rights at
home but small power of growth
beyond their own political walls.
In a fourth stage are many coun
tries at the present time. This
period is marked by a union of
cities under a monarch. Its union
is artificial, being based on territor
ial extent. Its philosophy is that
of liberalism, which emphasizes the
importance of the individual above
all national interests.
As it becomes clearer that we share
in a society that hasmany common
ideals, there appears an interpreta
tion of national unity which is to
regard government as more than a
mere machine. To this idea, ac
cording to Dr. Reinsch, the nations
of today are tending, —to a modern
imperialism.
The motives of modern imperial
ism were then considered. Of these,
over-population is rather a poten
tial strength, depending for an
opening on the initiative of such
forces as missionary work and the
expeditions of rash young military
commanders.
Modern diplomacy is a " struggle
for markets." Commerce is said
to follow the Hag. These axioms
are to some extent true, according
to the speaker. Colonial trade
does not tend to come to the mother
country, without tariff reductions,
but political authority can never
compel it. Unless the economics
of trade be looked after, the politics
of trade will fail. It is unwise to
neglect trade with the leading na
tions of Europe in an attempt to
gain the trade of the tropics.
The most important value which
colonies have to a nation's trade is
their location as depots to a great
market. Communication, then, is
more.important than the control of
territory. Russia has striven for
centuries to have an outlet t<> the
sea; while England's political his
tory has been determined by the
effort to keep a route to India. ( 112
such value is communication with
the islands of Port) Rico and Ha
waii and the Philippines to us.
