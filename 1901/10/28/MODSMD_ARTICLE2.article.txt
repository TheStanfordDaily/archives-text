# Olympic-Alumni vs. Varsity.
## 
### 
The game which was contem
plated for tomorrow with an Olym
pic-Alumni picked team has been
called off by the coaches, who
think that the harm that#might
come in the shape of injuries to
the players would affect the good
that would come from the practice.
This leaves only one more game,
that with Nevada on the oval Sat
urday.
The officials for the big game
with Berkeley will be selected to
morrow. It is possible that Ralph
Hoagland, who umpired so well
at last year's contest, will be again
secured.
On Wednesday all of the Var
sity candidates who can get away
will go to Berkeley to see the game
between Nevada and the team
across the bay. They will leave
on the 11:59 in the morning, com
ing back right after the game.
Everj r morning from now on, the
men will take a run around the
oval before breakfast.
