# Wrestling Tournament.
## 
### 
The committee which has charge
of the wrestling tournament in
Encina gymnasium has drafted a
copy of rules to govern the tour
nament. The rules have been made
to favor, if there is any favoritism
shown, the more inexperienced
wrestlers. As soon as practical a
date will be set for the tournament.
It is greatly desired that more men
should enter. Any man, whether
he has had any experience or not,
should try. The matches will be
carefully arranged, so that as near
as possible men -of equal ability
will meet.
"Al" Lean will start a wrestling
class in the gymnasium tomorrow
morning at 11 o'clock and will
give instructions daily at that hour.
