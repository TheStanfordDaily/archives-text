### 
Through failure to kick a field
goal, the Olympics lost to Califor
nia last Saturday by a score of 6-5.
The game was played on a heavy
field and was slow and sluggish, ex
cept for a few brilliant plays. For
the most part the club team had
the better of the argument, Berke
ley's work being far from strong.
The one spectacular feature of
the game was a seventy-five-yard
run made by Sherman, California
half, who played last year on his
freshman team. Olympic had
scored and was defending her terri
tory successfully against the colle
gians. Cutter, of the winged "0,"
punted across the center of the field
twenty yards into California terri
tory. The ball fell into Sherman's
arms, there was a tangle of players,
and out of the mix-up came the
Berkeley half behind the interfer
ence of four men. None of the
club men could reach him, and, in
a great run.he sprinted seventy
live yards down the field to a touch
down. Overall kicked the goal,
making the final score G to 5.
The Berkeley backs show im
provement and Overall is punt
ing well. The club team was su
perior in the line, and fumbled
less.
