# GOOD FOOTBALL.
## Both Teams Show Up Well in One of the Best Practices This Season. 
### 
Last night, in ideal football
weather, the Varsity and second
eleven teams lined up for one of
the longest and best drills they
have yet had. In all, the two
teams played about an hour, no
intermission being taken between
the halves. The Varsity had the
ball nearly all the time and made
steady gains, scoring three touch
downs by an almost entirely buck
ing game, as a sharp west wind in
terfered badly with Hill's punts.
The second team, on the other
hand, made only slight gains on
bucks and runs, were held often on
downs, and made most of their dis
tance by fullback Parker's kicks.
The Varsity fumbled only twice,
once by Fisher and once by Bans
bach, both times the ball being re
covered. The scrubs fumbled three
times, one of these being by Parker
and one by \V. Dole, and both
going to the big team by Horen.
Out of one hundred and eleven
downs the Varsity had the ball for
seventy-three, using sixty-eight of
these for runs or bucks, and earn
ing thus two hundred and fifty
seven yards. They made no gain
in thirteen downs, and the average
distance to a run was about three
and two-thirds yards. In Hill's
live punts only ninety-five yards
were made, an average of nineteen
yards to the punt. The big team
ran in with noticeable gains three
of Parker's six kicks, one by Barn
hisel for five yards, one by Ken
nedy for twenty yards, and one by
Bansbach for five yards. Traeger
tried a place-kick from the twenty
yard line, but the wind rendered it
unsuccessful. In the second team's
six kicks Parker made one hundred
and eighty-live yards, an average
of almost thirty-one yards to the
kick, and in their thirty-two bucks
they gathered forty-three yards, an
average of almost two yards to the
buck. They were held without
gain for seventeen downs, and were
forced back once for two yards.
Crawford of the second team has to
his credit a live-yard run-in of
Hill's punt, and Parker made nine
yards in the same way.
Barnhisel played his usual good
game and was responsible for more
than one block of the second team's
buck. iMcFadden's game was hard
and quick and his gains, while
never spectacular, were steady and
fairly large. Hill also played in
good form and gained from two to
eighteen yards at a buck. He was,
however, stopped . twice without
gain, once by Roosevelt, and once
by P. Tarpey, who, with Bartell,
held the scrub halves for a while.
Butterlield, at scrub left end,
stopped Traeger once with no gain,
and while he was in the line played
almost up to bis form in Friday
night's practice when, at second
eleven half, he broke up six plays
in succession and got his man each
time. Nutter, on the second team,
as guard, also showed up well,
blocking up several plays, notably
one by Fisher, who was sent
straight in. P. Tarpey made a
good fifteen-yard run around left

end to Raitt's tackle, and Fisher
came hack at the scrubs three
downs later hy a dash of eighteen
yards around right end to Tarpey's
tackle. Hill immediately followed
for fifteen yards on the other side
over Tarpey's tackle to Lee, who
held him. The big center did some
very good playing last night, and
got into nearly every play in his
old Varsity form. Monzingo piled
new honors on his Freshman head
by his work at guard, although he
went in rather late in the practice.
He stopped Smith once, and Roose
velt once, both with no gain. Horen
stopped Bartell twice with a run of
less than a yard, added several
good runs to the Varsity's gains,
and covered two of the second
team's fumbles. One of the finest
plays of the practice was made by
Roosevelt, the last thing before the
team went in, when he dashed in
twenty-live yards behind good in
terference for the last touchdown.
Raitt's interference for his men
was shown very well last night
when he led Clark around the sec
ond team's right end for a twenty
yard gain.
Taken all around, coaches and
trainer may be congratulated on
the progress of the team, their snap
and vigor, their team work and
their physical" condition.

ball nearly all the time and made
steady gains, scoring three touch
downs by an almost entirely buck
ing game, as a sharp west wind in
terfered badly with Hill's punts.
The second team, on the other
hand, made only slight gains on
bucks and runs, were held often on
downs, and made most of their dis
tance by fullback Parker's kicks.
The Varsity fumbled only twice,
once by Fisher and once by Bans
bach, both times the ball being re
covered. The scrubs fumbled three
times, one of these being by Parker
and one by \V. Dole, and both
going to the big team by Horen.
Out of one hundred and eleven
downs the Varsity had the ball for
seventy-three, using sixty-eight of
these for runs or bucks, and earn
ing thus two hundred and fifty
seven yards. They made no gain
in thirteen downs, and the average
distance to a run was about three
and two-thirds yards. In Hill's
live punts only ninety-five yards
were made, an average of nineteen
yards to the punt. The big team
ran in with noticeable gains three
of Parker's six kicks, one by Barn
hisel for five yards, one by Ken
nedy for twenty yards, and one by
Bansbach for five yards. Traeger
tried a place-kick from the twenty
yard line, but the wind rendered it
unsuccessful. In the second team's
six kicks Parker made one hundred
and eighty-live yards, an average
of almost thirty-one yards to the
kick, and in their thirty-two bucks
they gathered forty-three yards, an
average of almost two yards to the
buck. They were held without
gain for seventeen downs, and were
forced back once for two yards.
Crawford of the second team has to
his credit a live-yard run-in of
Hill's punt, and Parker made nine
yards in the same way.
Barnhisel played his usual good
game and was responsible for more
than one block of the second team's
buck. iMcFadden's game was hard
and quick and his gains, while
never spectacular, were steady and
fairly large. Hill also played in
good form and gained from two to
eighteen yards at a buck. He was,
however, stopped . twice without
gain, once by Roosevelt, and once
by P. Tarpey, who, with Bartell,
held the scrub halves for a while.
Butterlield, at scrub left end,
stopped Traeger once with no gain,
and while he was in the line played
almost up to bis form in Friday
night's practice when, at second
eleven half, he broke up six plays
in succession and got his man each
time. Nutter, on the second team,
as guard, also showed up well,
blocking up several plays, notably
one by Fisher, who was sent
straight in. P. Tarpey made a
good fifteen-yard run around left

end to Raitt's tackle, and Fisher
came hack at the scrubs three
downs later hy a dash of eighteen
yards around right end to Tarpey's
tackle. Hill immediately followed
for fifteen yards on the other side
over Tarpey's tackle to Lee, who
held him. The big center did some
very good playing last night, and
got into nearly every play in his
old Varsity form. Monzingo piled
new honors on his Freshman head
by his work at guard, although he
went in rather late in the practice.
He stopped Smith once, and Roose
velt once, both with no gain. Horen
stopped Bartell twice with a run of
less than a yard, added several
good runs to the Varsity's gains,
and covered two of the second
team's fumbles. One of the finest
plays of the practice was made by
Roosevelt, the last thing before the
team went in, when he dashed in
twenty-live yards behind good in
terference for the last touchdown.
Raitt's interference for his men
was shown very well last night
when he led Clark around the sec
ond team's right end for a twenty
yard gain.
Taken all around, coaches and
trainer may be congratulated on
the progress of the team, their snap
and vigor, their team work and
their physical" condition.
