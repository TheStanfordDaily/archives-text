# "Billy" Erb at Columbia.
## 
### 
An excellent story is being told
on "Hilly" Erb, who is now a
student at Columbia. He occupied
a front seat when the first lecture
of the semester was given by Dean
Kirchwey, whose first step was to
give "Hilly" a hard legal query.
After stating it the dean remarked:
" Now, we will suppose that my
mind is virgin soil, a perfect blank
fn this matter, and that I came to
you for light, Mr. Erb."
Erb was rather embarrassed, but
after a moment of silence he looked
up helplessly into the stern features
of the dean and said: " Professor,
my mind is in the same condition
as yours."
