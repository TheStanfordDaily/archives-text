The following is the explanation
the Plug Ugly Committee gives for
changing the date of their "Ugly"
from Saturday to Friday night:
In deference to a decision of the
Encina Club to give an informal
dance Saturday evening in the club
room, at which the Nevada football
men will be in attendance, the
time of the Plug Ugly has been:
changed from 7:30 Saturday night j
to the same hour Friday. Al-j
though Saturday had been selected j
in preference to Friday so as to ob
viate any danger of our football
men being placed in poor condi
tion for the Nevada game next day,
assurances were received that the
men could be present. If the per
formance begins promptly at 7:30
it will be over about ( J o'clock, so
that no one need be kept up late.
There are fewer conflicting affairs
Friday evening. It is the desire to
uive the Nevada visitors as pleasant
a time iis possible, and the dance
will contribute to their entertain
ment. The committee has found it
extremely difficult to set a date
which will avoid conflict, but, after
canvassing the situation, it has
been forced to the conclusion that
Friday is the most desirable time.
At 7 o'clock Thursday evening
another mob rehearsal of the .Jun
iors will take place at Encina gym
nasium.
