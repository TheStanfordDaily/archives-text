During the last ten years 1440
men have been measured in the
Encina gymnasium. Some of these
were measured several times. The
total number of examinations is
1779. Some of the best records
are: M. J. Newberg, height 6 feet,
(5.2 inches; Alexander Campbell-
Johnson, weight 222 pounds; W.
T. Young, strength of back, 655.6
pounds; W. T. Young, strength of
legs, 1210 pounds; 11. P. Cowles,
pull up, 17 times; \V, W. Burnett,!
lung capacity, 69; Edward Ber
wick, forearm (right) 215 pounds,
(left) 225 pounds; C. B. Raitt,
strength of chest, 250 pounds.
The reason that the pull-up
test is no greater is because
students are not pressed to un
dertake it. \V. T. Young was
first base on the Varsity baseball
team and a noted smasher of home
runs. \V. W. Burnett, football
captain of last year, hud a greater!
lung capacity than the machine
would register. C. li, Kaitt, in the|
chest test, put the indicator as far
upas it would go. Edward lier-i
wick, 6 feet, 4.8 inches, and Ed
Gilman, 6 feet, 2.5 inches, are closei
seconds to Newberg in height.
