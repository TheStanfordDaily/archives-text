As some pecuniary uneasiness
lias been aroused in the Junior
Class over the proposed action of
the Sophomores at the Plug Ugly —
if it ever happens —it might be well
to say that out of consideration for
the thoughtfulness on the part of
the Juniors, who have so kindly
postponed their Uglv, so that we
might be able to dedicate our new
bonnet with them, that our plot
will he mended from postponement
to postponement until we have an
amount of harrowing detail suffi
cient to allow the two classes to
dedicate arm in arm. We might
also say that the class of 1908 is
the lirst class that has not over
come its Freshman tendency of ex
treme gullibility after being here
two years. A Sophomore.
