# On the Track.
## 
### 
Thirty-nine men, about a half a
dozen of whom were last year's
track men, appeared on Saturday
morning and were put through
some paces by "Dad" Moulton and
McCaughern. Some excellent ma
terial is at hand among the new
men, and the remainder of the
semester will be spent in light work
in preparation for the harder train
ing of the spring. McCaughern,
Fowler, Lewis, Nangle, Hawley,
Holman, Harkins, Kuhn, and
Sprague are the only old men out
at present. A handicap field-day
is being arranged and will proba
bly be held in about three weeks.
The new material will then have a
chance to show itself.
