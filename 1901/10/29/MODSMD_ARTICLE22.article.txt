### 
The fair being held in Fraternity
Hall in Palo Alto by the Catholic
ladies of Palo Alto and the students
of the University, promises to be a
very enjoyable event for all who
attend. This evening a short pro
gram will be followed by dancing,
and this will be repeated tomorrow
evening. Booths have been ar
ranged for the sale of fancy arti
cles, such as sofa pillows, pictures,
and room ornaments, and refresh
ments will be served throughout
the evening.
There will probably be a large
attendance from the student body
of the University.
