# ERNEST F. FENOLLOSA.
## The 						Japanese Art Expert Will Lecture in the Assembly Hall. 
### 
Mr. Fenollosa's lecture Wednes
day evening in the Assembly Hall
at 8 p.m. will be on "The Five
Periods of Japanese Art." A large
number of photographic lantern
slides of Japanese painting, statu
ary, and so forth will be used to
illustrate the lecture. The first
period about which Mr. Fenollosa
will lecture is that of early religious
sculpture in the seventh and eighth
centuries, comprising early Budd
hist art in India, China,Corea,and
Japan. The second period is that
of early religious painting in the
ninth, tenth, and eleventh cen
turies, when Chinese painting was
a prominent artistic feature. The
third period is that of historical
painting and portraiture in the
twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth
centuries, when a purely national
school of art prevailed in Japan.
The fourth period deals with land
scape painting in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, Chinese ideal
ism being the source of landscape
art. And the fifth period deals with
the impressionism and realism of
the seventeenth, eighteenth, and
nineteenth centuries, when national
iHeals were the dominant note in
Japanese art.
.Sir Fenollosa is very competent
to speak on the subject of Japanese
art, as he has spent many years
studying it in Japan, having filled
at various times the positions of
Japanese Commissioner of Fine
Arts, organizer of the art depart
ment of the Imperial Museum in
Tokio, and manager of the Govern
ment Fine Arts Academy. When,
in 1890, he returned to America to
inaugurate the oriental depart
ment of the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts, he was recognized by
both Europeans and Japanese as
the world's leading expert in the
Japanese art, and had been per
sonally decorated by the Emperor
of Japan. Mr. Fenollosa proposes
to spend the winter of 1901-1902
in lecturing throughout America
and England on the oriental
studies which he has been pursuing
in the last twenty-three years.
The nature of his lectures is more
than antiquarian. Mr. Fenolktsa
speaks from direct experience and
with the enthusiasm of a pioneer,
concerning the slow process already
begun, of a mingling of East and
West, from which lie prophesies a
greater expansion of thought than
has occurred since the era of Co
lumbus. Tickets for the lecture
will be on sale at all the drugstores
in Palo Alto, and at the Bookstore
on the campus.
