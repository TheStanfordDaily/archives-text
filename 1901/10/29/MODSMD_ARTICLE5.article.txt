# " THE OPENING OF CHINA."
## Dr. Reinsch's Second Lecture on the " Motives and Methods of Modern Colonial Expansion." 
### 
jl'Flie chapel was well HI led at 1:30
this afternoon when Dr. Reinsch
began his lecture on the "Opening
of China." He said:
Yesterday we came to the con
clusion that political dominion is a
certain large advantage to a coun
try which owns territory in the
East. Today we come to the ques
tion of industrial expansion, which
has had an important influence
toward the end of the nineteenth
century, as shown in the efforts to
invest capital in newly developed
countries.
This industrialism is a more di
rect and efficient method of expan
sion than either missionary work
or the exploitation of nations, es
pecially if it is used to develop the
latent resources of a country.
China at present has a feudal
form of government, feudalism of
resting on a family or clan basis.
She is very conservative and makes
obedience to custom her most im
portant form of control. The ques
tion is, Can China pass beyond
this stage of civilization and attain
to something higher? The Chin
ese are good merchants and good
laborers, their civilization is peace
ful, and their individual morality
is high, but they lack organization.
They lack the higher morality that
comes with a distinctly national
form of government.
The final question is the out
come of the present situation in
China. Future history alone can
work out its solution. There are
two possible outcomes to this sit
uation : Either European nations
will continue to push their indus
trial exploitation, which has re
ceived a severe check from the re
cent troubles in China, or else
China of its own accord will begin
to organize itself and model its
government on the basis of Western
civilization. In 1897-98 the revo
lution in China to secure a more
national government began. The
only thing that is needed to com
plete the work is the crystallization
of forms, which cancomeonly from
the West. The Chinese are willing
to learn, and therefore the history
of Japan will be repeated in China.
The present situation has been
made much more difficult by the
recent troubles. No good at all
has come of them, and they have
forced upon the Chinese people the
tradition of a foreign invasion. The
motive for the coming organization
will therefore be self-defense, and
China will be less ready than ever
to adopt our higher civilization.
Tomorrow Mr. Reinsch will
speak of the problems in India, and
the "Meeting of the Orient and Oc
cident."
