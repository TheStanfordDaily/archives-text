Is footkai-l degenerating at
Stanford? The fact that more men
have entered for the preliminary
Carnot debates than appear for
practice on the football field would
seem to aflirm the question. The
loss of interest and enthusiasm on
the part of the men themselves is
incomprehensible. To be sure, the
faculty expect more of our athletes
than at almost any other univer
sity. They are shown neither con
sideration nor leniency when be
hind in their studies. A Stanford
athlete has no chance to be medi
ocre. lie is the one who generally
gets a warning card, because in
structors watch his work with criti
cal eyes and forget to think of the
student by his side, who, with half
the work and worry, manages to
slip through, no one knows how.
The one is under suspicion; the
other is hardly considered. It is
an extreme condition when men
complain about giving two hours
every afternoon to football on the
plea that they can not spare the
time.
The football squad is despair
ingly small. It has been impos
sible to give the Varsity good prac
tice when men on both teams
know each others signals, and the
players have had to be changed so
often because of lack of numbers
that this could not be prevented.
The following communication in
the Califovnian October 25th by
Coach Hopper is applicable to our
own men:
With the big game only two
weeks off, at this critical period
when ail energies should be di
rected to the finishing into perfect

shape of the varsity, a certain
class of men are deserting the Held |
and leaving us terribly handicap
ped.
The action of the freshmen in
quitting, with but a few exceptions
is especially incomprehensible. I
doubt if the college was satisfied
with the results of the freshman
game. The coaches certainly were
not. But —oh, wonder of wonder!
— the freshmen seem absolutely so.
They strut about with inflated
chests and serene smiles as if they
were the heroes of some wonderful
victory. Having done so much for
their college (just think, they were
not entirely whitewashed!), they
think that now they can enjoy a
heavenly rest and chew the cud of
their contentment.
