# VARSITY'S GOOD WORK.
## Brisk and Snappy Practice of Last Night Encourage Supporters of the Cardinal. 
### 
All you hear on the quad, up the
row, and over at the hall now is
football and Stanford's chances for
the big game. The football spirit
is in the air, as it should be at a
time when every one who wears
the cardinal must do his little part
to bring the victory to Palo Alto.
The coaches are working night and
day over the problem of winning,
and the small crowd of men in the
squad are hammering themselves
into shape for a final strengthy ef
fort on the ninth. The feeling
everywhere is that Stanford must
win, and by a hig score.
There are pleasing indications,
too, that something of this kind
will happen. The Varsity is right
now playing the best ball it. has
played this year. There is a snap
piness to the work and an irresist
able onward spirit that is accom
plishing things. The team is
crippled in many ways, and there
are not nearly so many men 011 the
field as the coaches would wish,
but those who are playing are get
ting into it with a vim and dash
that attest their good condition.
"I am very well pleased with the
work," said Coach Fickert after
last night's practice. This state
ment from the head coach ought to
be the cause of more than a little
enthusiasm from the rooters, and
from all those who are looking for
Stanford to win the big game.
There is no question but that
the contagious spirit of A 1 Lean
and his presence on the field and
in the training-house has had much
to do with the improvement in the
team. He is a professional trainer
who knows everything in his busi
ness, from the use of liniment and
the bandaging of sprains to that
other requisite quality, the ability
to encourage the men. In a game
he is everywhere with a sponge and
a cheering word. He has got "the
right idea," and Stanford has been
more than fortunate in securing his
services.
One good man went out of the
game for the season at last night's
practice. Boren, who is perhaps
the most unlucky player on the
field, broke his left forearm, frac
turing both bones. This consider
ably narrows the contest for end
positions, and lessens the amount
of available material. The coaches
now have only Clark, Kuhn,
Cooper, and Preston to choose
from, unless some exceptional play
ing develops in the second eleven.
Paul Tarpey may be tried at the
place within the coming week and
used as a sub. He has the neces
sary speed for the place and has
the football instinct plus.
Hill also met with an injury that
looked seveie for a while, in the
shape of ;i sprained ankle. Trainer
Moulion reported today that lie is
doing nicely and that the mishap
won't in any way injure his chances
for the hig game. Hill has been
doing scnne splendid work at half
hitely, and if lit; were put out of the
game it would mean much to us.
The practice, barring these acci
dents, was a most satisfactory one,

and the superiority of the Varsity
over the second eleven was seldom,
if ever, more clearly demonstrated.
Three touchdowns were scored and
the play was brisk from start to
finish. Traeger played remarka
bly fine ball, as did also big Mc-
Fadden, who is getting into it in
great style and who carries the ball
perhaps better than anybody on
the field. Clark at end is also
right there with the bells when it
comes to advancing the oval, and
his work is entirely up to Varsity
form. Roosevelt made some beau
tiful plunges into the line, drawing
down a number of pretty gains.
On the second eleven, Butterfield
played more than ordinarily well,
and Tarpey's brilliant open field
running makes the freshman a Var
sity possibility. The coaches com
plain that there is not enough ma
terial out for the second team, and
that much more could he accom
plished if more men appeared on
the field in suits.
There was not much yelling on
the bleachers last evening and none
too large a crowd was out. The
accident to Boren seemed to sober
tlie rooters into silence, though
Hill was given a yell when he was
helped limping off the field.
Six of the Varsity candidates
and three of the coaches went to
Berkeley today to see the game be
tween California and Nevada.
They left on the 11:59 and will he
back this evening. Those who
went were Slaker, Raitt, Fisher,
Traeger, McFadden, Hill, and
Clark, and Coaches Fickert and
McMillan.
