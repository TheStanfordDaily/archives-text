Saturday afternoon the Zoology
department conducted field work,
in the form of collecting nnd ob
servation, at Halfnioon Hay. A
low tide between noon and 3 o'clock

expedition were all that could have
been desired.
Professor Heath and Mr. Spauld
ing were in charge of the expedi
tion. Mr. Snyder was also on the
trip. There were about thirty stu
dents in the party.
A bus left the quad at half past
ten Friday morning. This con
veyed most of the co-eds. All bag
gage and apparatus were sent Fri
day morning, arriving at Spanish
town in the evening. A party of
four drove over, ami the rest, about
twenty, went on wheels. Most of
the bicyclists went by train to
either Belmont or San Mateo and
rode over from those points. The
best driving route, however, was
found to be by way of YVoodside.
With a few exceptions, the party
proceeded at once to the promen
tory, some four miles beyond Span
ishtown, and camped there Friday
night. Accommodations were se
cured in the shape of a schoolhouse
and some barns; the party was
