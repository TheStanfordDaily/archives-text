# Boren Out of It.
## 
### 
F. 11. Boren, '02, whose left fore
arm received a nasty fracture in
lust, night's practice, was an almost
certain Varsity man, if he had not
met with the accident which put
him out of the game. All season
lie lias been considered as a prac
tical certainty, and his loss to the
team at this time cannot but he
felt. He has played on the worst
kind of luck, being off the field for
a few weeks with water on the
knee. But as soon as lie was able
to come out again, he got into the
liue-up and played Varsity ball.
His work was fearless, strong, and
heady.
For the last three years Boren
has been prominently connected
with Stanford football. Two years
ago he played fullback on the Var
sity and last year did great work
in the same position on the second
team.
