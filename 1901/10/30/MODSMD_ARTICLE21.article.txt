Under the regulations of the
University fifteen hours constitute
a semester's work. These fifteen
hours are supposed to require forty
five actual hours per week in lec
tures, recitations, laboratory work,
and preparation for the same. A
University student, as distinguished
from a high school pupil, is under
stood to he one who wishes to dig
down deeply into a subject and not
merely to attain passing grade in a
certain amount of scheduled work.
The real student can therefore
always spend profitably more time
than is conventionally allotted to
his work. On the other hand, tbe
exceptionally bright student can
often get what he wants out of a
particular subject in less than the
allotted time. University regula
tions permit the student to register
for as many as eighteen or as few
as thirteen hours, except that a
condition or failure incurred in
iiny semester limits the student to
fifteen hours the following semester.
Students may also register for less
than thirteen hours by special per
mission of the committee.
The figures given below show the
actual registration for the present
semester. The average number of
hours per strident is 14.3. The
statistics, however, include grad
uate students, whose work is not
generally measured in hours; the
probable average for undergrad
uates is not far from fifteen.
