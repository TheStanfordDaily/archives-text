# ORIENT AND OCCIDENT.
## The 						Problem of England in India the Subject of Prof. Reinsch's Third Lecture. 
### 
The third lecture of Dr. Reinsch
on the subject of "World Politics"
dealt with the topic "The Meeting
of the Orient and the Occident."
The following is an outline of his
remarks:
Today we approach a broader
problem than that of industrial de
velopment, namely, that of the
total effect of a Western nation
upon people of the Orient. Where i
such a meeting occurs, as in India,
new ideas and new national qual
ities will develop.
India presents a complexity of
climate, of races, and of language,
the English speaking people being
only one-twenty-fourth of the pop-1
ulation. Brahminism, the prevail-!
ing religion, is not dogmatic, but
seeks to embrace all forms of wor
ship. As a social force, however,
Brahminism is inflexible. Second
in influence is the imported mono
theistic creed, Mohammedanism,
which has great power among the
lower castes of India. A complex
syßtem of castes has been developed
from the old simple triad of the
priesthood, the army, and the pur
suit of agriculture. Caste exclu
siveness affects life and adminis
tration in many ways.
The political importance of the
complex social system of India was
first, brought out in the mutiny of
1857, when a minor decree of the
English government was misin
terpreted by the Brahmins. Ori
ental shrewdness was afraid that
the English were attempting to
Christianize India and overthrow
the castes. Queen Victoria's de
cree has declared the policy of
England never to again interfere
with the native customs.
Reforms have been proposed by
the Liberal party to give India the
benefits of Western liberty. Free
dom of the press has not developed
an independent public opinion,
but merely licensed intolerant criti
cism and narrow quarrels of creed.
City administration is not success
ful, owing to the incompetence of
the Indian officials. Further de
velopment for India cannot be
hoped for until her committees be
come better. National representa
tion has failed utterly because
there is lack of national feeling,
and the lower caste majority are
despised by the minority. Equal
administration of the laws has
worked a hardship to the poorer
classes because they are prosecuted
for debt by usurers. The jury sys
tem has not shown its full value,
because the oriental idea of justice
will not let a Bralunin testify
against an equal; moreover, English
juries will not convict an English
man. In every instance we seethat
our most perfect institutions are
not adapted to the society of the
East.
Although fond of education, the
Oriental shows a marvelous mem
ory unenforced by the power of
analysis or originality In the
civil service they need constant di
rection and advice. A native op
erator saw the station-master at
tacked by a tiger, and running to

his instrument he signalled head
quarters: "Tiger eating station
master; wire instructions." Future
attempts to influence the Orient
will allow the growth of a native
literature and emphasize the scien
tific knowledge of the West.
Some idea is needed to unify
India. Officials are bound by cus
tom, and their subjects obey with a
fatalistic trust the mandates of an
emperor. It is proposed to make a
systematic use of this feeling of al
legiance to a ruler divinely en
dowed. Many persons believe that
a reflex result will demand that
English institutions be modified,
and royal power in the old world
will be emphasized. Aristocracy
is receiving an access of power from
these developments.
Higher development in the Orient
can come only through an empha
sis of communalism and of the in
dividual against the powers of cus
tom and antiquity. The Oriental
mind lacks a conception of natural
law, submitting itself to the tricks
of fate. Spirit life is an actual
fact of Oriental thought. This at
titude will give way to the doctrine
of natural law, if approached
through the medium of applied
sciences. The attempts to modify
philosophically the beliefs of the
Orient have not succeeded.
