# EXPANSION OF RUSSIA.
## Dr. Reinsch Concludes the Series of Lectures on Modern World Politics. 
### 
The fourth lecture in the series |
given by Doctor Reinsch was like)
those which preceded it, interesting
and well attended. We give a
sketch of his remarks:
"Russia, as a power in the East,
stands nearer in the social scale to
the Oriental people with whom she
is working. Her population merits
the sympathy of the world, while
her political ambitions may be a
danger. A mass of industrious,
quaint farmers is controlled by a
caste, an aristocracy of eflicient
public officers. This latter class
works ambitiously in the interest
of Russian nationality.
"Although he is supreme, the
Czar cannot entirely dominate his
aristocracy. The Czardom will,
however, be supported as the great
means by which Russia can rule
the Orient. For this purpose
homogeneity is all important, and
the national Greek church is the
strongest influence in this direc
tion.
A double policy is evident in
the case of Russia: national unity
and intolerance in Europe, and a
free assimilation in her dealings
with Asia.
"Russia's expansion is based on
communication, and her line of
growth is directed to three points
of geographical importance : to
Constantinople, to the Persian
Gulf, and to the Pacific. She has
broken the sovereignty of the Turks
in many places, and by ingenious
campaigning in Western Asia has
punished warlike tribes, such as
the Turkomans, using the con
quered people for her own purposes
in building roads and railways.
With her invasion there is an in
dustrial advancement, but at the
sacrifice of many curious and an
tique sorts of handiwork.
"In Eastern Asia the aims of
Russia have been to secure control
of Manchuria. She holds conces
sions for lines of railway in China
proper. Without a war she can
not l>e dislodged from her position.
The most serious boundary ques
tion is the matter of Corea, which
Russia may claim. Such a step
will inevitably result in war with
Japan, for that country is in no
mood to yield her natural rights
over territory so near to her.
"The expansion of Russia is a
natural one, for her peasants emi
grate to take a place among the
land-laborers of the East. There
is not the same policy of exploita
tion, which is shown by England
in India. Russians are ready to
fraternize, and they believe that.
India would welcome assistance in
a revolt from England.
"The conquest of India by Rus
sia would follow naturally from
the Russian tendency of assimila
tion, but we Imve no direct assur
ance to declare that this is a part
of her present policy. The wish
for India can not be called the key
to her expansion. Communication
is still her great object, and a de
sire to have an outlet to the sea.
Russia is always ready to take ad
vantage of the preoccupation of

her enemies. Five years ago no
one would have believed that the
influence of England could be so
small in Asia as it is today. While
England is weakened, Russia has
advanced to her present position.
Her future policy will he one of
peace, to develop the wealth al
ready at her command. She may
employ the threat against India to
maintain her power over Eng
land."
