# JAPANESE ART.
## Mr. Ernest F. Fenollosa Gives Interesting Lecture on Subject. 
### 
The devotee√ü who went to hear
an exposition of Japanese art, the
students who went to see a magic
lantern exhibition, and the Japan
ese who went to see glimpses of
their home land, were all pleased
with Ernest F. Fenollosa's lecture
in Assembly Hall last evening,
lie dealt with art largely in an his
torical sense, tracing its periods of
growth and explaining what for
eign influences affected it. Each
period he illustrated with lantern
slides of paintings, statues, and re
lief work, closing with a brief re
view of the whole field of Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean art.
Seven hundred A. 1). he placed
as the culmination of the first great
period of art. This art was not in
digenous with the Japanese, but
was brought over from India by
the Buddhist priests. It made
itself felt in bronze statuary, mostly
of Buddha mounted sitting on a
lotus lily, with an immense halo of
filigree work behind his head.
Prior to this time Japanese artists
had made some clay models in low
and full relief work, and under the
new influence developed bronze
work to its highest form. It is in
teresting, he said, to note that the
bronze statues of this period were
draped after the Greek fashion,
while the head-dress was Indian.
From this he conuluded that this
art was indigenous with Greece,
arid came to Japan through India
and Korea.
The next period, culminating in
the tenth century, was largely in
fluenced by Chinese art. In this
period landscape painting devel
oped. Many beautiful slides were
shown of Buddist priests sitting
alone in sea caves, or in villas on
cliff tops, contemplating the poetry
and beanty of nature around them.
The third period was of purely
Japanese origin. It grew up in the
twelfth century among Japanese of
the lower classes who had no ideals
and no idealism. They simply
painted the things in every day
life around them. His lantern
slides of this period consisted of an
imals and of scenes in the bazaars
and streets.
In 1400 the fourth period of art
culminated. It was largely of Chi
nese inspiration, and dealt with
Chinese scenes and ideas.
Up to this time sculpturing and
painting were part of a priest's
training. The masterpieces were
the work of Buddhist priests; artists
had not existed apart from the
clergy. However, in 1400 the first
great Japanese school of purely
decorative painting had its origin
in a Japanese artist named Kano.
His ability has lived in his family,
and today its living representative
is among Japan's greatest artists.
His house is full of priceless heir
looms, and his family lore rich in
the secrets of the art. Mr. Fenol
losa closed with a description of the
artist's life and his personal rela
tion with him that hud been
largely responsible for his knowl
edge of Japanese art.
