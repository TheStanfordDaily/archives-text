# Short Practice.
## 
### 
Only about thirty men were out
for practice last night, and the ab
sence of the coaches and many of
the Varsity players, who had gone
across the bay to witness the Ber
keley-Nevada game, left the two
teams more nearly evenly matched.
Only about an hour's work was
done, and, while both teams played
very good ball, the evening was des
titute of startling plays.
After the usual running of sig
nals the men lined up f>r a short
practice, and the Varsity scored
two touchdowns on their adver
saries. Butterfieid, the second team
halfback, did some tine tackling
and blocking of plays, making an
especially low, line tackle of Roose
velt in a clear field. Good ball was
also played by Knight, at Varsity
end. Bat tel 1, at right half on the
scrub team, played his usual good
game, as did also Dave Tarpey at
left half on the Varsity. Mon
zingo, at guard, put up a good
fight against Barnhisel, whose su
perior weight and experience made
him a hard man for the Freshman
to hold. Van Sickle, the big guard
who covered himself with glory in
the Freshman game, has almost re
covered from a bad cold caught
last week, and will be out
tonight. The Freshmen who are
out so far have been doing fair
work. Among these are the two
Tarpeys, Bar tell, Monzingo, Wilbur.
Sefton, and W. Dole. Nutter is
improving in his work, and last
night, at right tackle on the second
team, he broke through his man
and blocked Paul Tarpey's kick in
good shape. Preston is another
man who has good possibilities in
him. He is energetic and fast, and
he lias fair football instinct. Last
night lie put to his credit a good
quick run down the field to a hard
tackle of Bansbacb, who was run
ning in a punt.
The line-up last night was:
VARSITY. SECOND.
