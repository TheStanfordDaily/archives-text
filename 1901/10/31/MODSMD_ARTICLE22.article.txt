# INSULAR DECISIONS.
## Brief Outline of Interesting Discussion by Prof. Hall of Law Department. 
### 
On Tuesday evening Professor J.
P. Hall of the Law department lec
tured on the "Insular Decisions of
the United States Supreme Court."
He explained that the "insular
cases" involved the validity of
duties imposed upon goods passing
between the United States and
l'orto llico during the time from
the outbreak of the Spanish war to
the middle of the year 1900. This
time fell into three periods, accord
ing to the legal authority under
which the duties were collected.
From the beginning of the war to
the date of annexation duties were
imposed in Porto llico on goods
from the United States under mili
tary authority; from the date of
annexation to May 1, 1900, they
were imposed under this authority,
subject to any laws of Congress
then applicable; from May, 1900,
they were imposed under the
Foraker act. In the United States
duties were imposed on goods from
Porto Rico under the Dingley
tariff law until May 1, 1900; from
then on they have been imposed
under the Foraker act.
As to the first period it was held
the duties were valid, because a
military commander in enemy's
country in time of war has abso
lute power.
As to the second period, the
duties were held invalid both in
the United States and Porto llico
because collected contrary to the
provision of the Dingley act which
permitted the taxation only of
goods from foreign countries. By
annexation Porto Rico ceased to be
a foreign country, and so such
duties were forbidden.
The question was presented
whether a tariff violated the con
stitutional provision that all duties
shall be uniform throughout the
United States. There was no pre
vious decision of the court on the
question and only a few conflicting
dicta. The court decided, five to
four, that the words "United
States" did not include Porto llico.
All of the majority judges agreed
that Porto Rico, under any con
struction of the words "United
States" was not included, and so
duties could be imposed on goods
from there.
The minority of ' the court
thought "United States" meant all
our territory and included Porto
Rico, so the duties were bad be
cause not uniform over till our ter
ritory.
The question, What other clauses
of the constitution do or do not
apply to Porto Rico? was not raised
or decided in the insular cases. All
of the judges uttered dicta to the
effect that the amendment guar
anteeing certain so-called natural
rights, such as life, liberty, prop
erty, free speech and the like, did
apply there.
It was not decided whether per
sons born m Porto Rico are citizens
of the United States or not, but the
inference from the decision is that
they are not, because not born in
the United States. All these ques
tions must be decided later, as they
arise.
