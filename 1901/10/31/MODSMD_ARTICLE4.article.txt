# NEVADA LOSES.
## Berkeley Defeats the Sagebrush Team by a Score of 12 to 0. 
### 
Yesterday on the Berkeley cam
pus the Nevada football team was
defeated by the Berkeley varsity in
a game in which nothing but shifty
tactics and splendid team work is
responsible for the score. In the
first twenty-five minute half neither
side scored, but the visiting teTtm
smashed its opponents' vulnerable
line for seventy-five yards, using
tandems through tackles and :i
guards-back formation through on
each side of the center. It lost the
ball twice on downs, however,
but promptly regained it on Ber
keley's fumbles. After an exchange
of kicks California had the ball in
the center of the field.
U. C. used Overall for punts in
the second half, and then sent in
right half Whipple, behind the in
terference of Aibertson and Over
all, and with clever blocking work
by Mini, Moore, and Hudson, for a
fifty-nine-yard dash to a touch
down, in the first three minutes of
play, Overall kicking the goal.
California then began her tactics of
rushing Nevada with end runs,
punting often into the visitors'
territory and forcing a return kick
which would permit the return to
end runs. The Berkeley team
worked the ball twice down the
field to the goal-line, but they lost
one touchdown by off-side play.
This put them back to the ten
yard line, where Overall tried a
place kick for field goal, but the
attempt was blocked by Nevada's
right guard, Smith, who secured
the ball. From tlie thirty-five
yard line Nevada punted, putting
the ball in the center of the field.
More ran it in ten yards, Nevada
was penalized ten yards, Berkeley
bucked the tackles for short dis
tances, and Womble made twenty
three yards in by an end run, Mini
making the touchdown through
tack le.
More, Berkeley's fullback, ran in
Nevada's punts in three big gains,
one of thirty-three yards, another
of thirty-four yards, and several of
ten yards. Seven fumbles were
made by Berkeley and three by
Nevada; Berkeley was crowded
back seven times, losing eighteen
yards; Nevada four times, losing
three yards. California was, bow
ever, never held on downs, while
Nevada lost the ball thus three
times. Nevada was penalized
twenty yards, Berkeley not at all.
After the game Nevada's coach,
A. C. Steckle, Michigan's famous
right tackle of 'i) 8 and '99, captain
of the team in the latter year, and
assigned to a place in the "All-
America team" of '98, complained
that California's runners held to
the belts of men in the interference,
in violation of the rules, and also
that the time-keepers, both Cali
fornia men, lengthened out the sec
ond half to give California a chance
to score a third time.
