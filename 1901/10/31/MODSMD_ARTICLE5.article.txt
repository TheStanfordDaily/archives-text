# Coaches on the Game.
## 
### 
Coach Fiokert returned today
from his little jaunt to Berkeley
more determined than ever to put a
winning team on the field the day

of the big game. From now on
the most attention will be given
the ends, for it is there that Cali
fornia has her strongest men and
most effective plays.
Speaking of the outlook, (he
coaeli said today: ''Whether we
win or not depends altogether on
the wny we develop the coining
week, and the condition of the men
â€”every sprain will lessen our
chances. Berkeley played a good,
speedy game yesterday, both on
offensive and defensive. Their
great point is their interference
around the end, which is pretty to
look upon. The Sagebrushers also
deserve great credit, for they
played a hard, fast game
all through the first half;
in the second they seemed to
lose their nerve. Their center did
all kinds of things to the Berkeley
man, fumbling the bill 1 time after
time, and their backs are all good
men. We ought to win from them,
though, by a bigger score than Ber
keley made; but that will depend
upon the length of the halves."
Coach McMillan, who accompan
ied Coach Fickert across the bay,
delivered bis opinion of the Berk
eley team and the game in these
words: " Berkeley did almost noth
ing in the first half, but in the
second she played a wonderful
game of ball. Her interference
was almost perfect, and it didn't
quit when the runner got clear of
the line, but accompanied him
down the field. The men played
fast and sure, and if their work
had been at all up to form in the
first half the score would have
been much larger. We ought to
beat Nevada by a bigger score than
Berkeley piled up, for 1 don't think
that Nevada can play so good a
game again. Regarding the out
look for our game with Berkeley,
1 should say that we have a fight
ing chance, but we haven't any cut
and dried victory."
