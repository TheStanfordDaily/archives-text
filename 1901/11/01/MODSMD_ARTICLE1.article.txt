# SONG PRACTICE.
## Men of University Will Gather at Encina Club Room Saturday Night. 
### 
Owing to the lateness of the ar
rival of the University song-books,
a song practice for the men of the
University will be given at Encina
tomorrow (Saturday) evening. The
informal dance which was to have
been given on that evening by the
Encina Club has been abandoned.
The evening will be a most oppor
tune time for a song practice, and
every man in the University should
attend.
So far we have had practically
no practice on our football songs
this season, and if they are to he
sung, and sung well, at the game,
considerable practice will be ab
solutely necessary. It is only a
week until the big game comes off,
and we must not let Berkeley
eclipse us in singing and yelling,
as she did at the Freshman
game. The Berkeley song-books
have been out and in constant
use for several weeks. Our Only
chance to equal Berkeley in the
singing at the game is by some
good hard work on our part. The
football men from the University
of Nevada will be at the University
Saturday and the song practice will
be an excellent chance to give them
a view of Stanford life and spirit.
Come Saturday night to Encina
with your song-books, prepared to
sing and yell.
