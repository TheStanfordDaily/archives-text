Where are the two hundred
and three men, who sire rooming
in Encina, eating? About twenty
five go over to the Terrace to eating
clubs, which moved down there
upon being excluded from the
Camp; another twenty-five make
three trips each day to Palo Alto,
where they get their meals at res
taurants. About fifty more pay
$20.00 per month for board on the
row; while the remaining one hun
dred, through mere desperation, eat
on the Asiatic plan at the Camp.
It is impossible to estimate the
irreparable injury these men are
inflicting upon themselves. Dr.
Wilbur positively states that the
fast riding and walking of the men
who go to l'alo Alto before and
after eating, and the inferior food
served at the "Chink's cafe' 1 are
sending men to him every day with
weak stomachs and digestive or
gans well on the way to ruin.
Three-fourths of the men at Encina
are confronted with this dilemma—
not being able to pay for board on
the row, they are ruining them
selves physically and incapaci
tating themselves for work.
What is the solution of this prob
lem? Stormy weather will soon
be upon us, and under present con
ditions this will cause considerable
misery incident to the trudging
through mud and rain.
We pass several times each day
a building equipped with the latest
appliances for the purpose of giving
Encina. men wholesome food at a
reasonable price. This structure
is empty. It draws no income.
Why could not the students under

take a co-operative dining hall
scheme, similar to that at Fox
Hall, Harvard? If student man
agement is impractical, because un
certain and changing, why does not
the faculty recognize our condition
and give us support • and advice?
Or possibly Mrs. Stanford, our
generous and gracious benefactress
in all other things, will solve this
eating problem for her students.
If Encina Hall is to remain the
center of college life, the source of
"Stanford spirit," and the best place
to live, something must be done.
