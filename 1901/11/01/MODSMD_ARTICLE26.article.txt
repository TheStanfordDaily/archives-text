# The
						New Song-Book.
## 
### 
The new song-book is finally
here, and was Hold on the bleachers
last night and on the quad today.
On the whole, it is superior to any
we have yet had. The book is at
tractive in appearance, the black
monogram on the cover being par
ticularly effective against the red
background, which is nearly, but
not quite, cardinal. The prize
hoiig, ".Just Because They Hit That
Line so Hard," to the tune "Goo-
Goo Eyes," is easy to memorize and
almost sings itself, the words tit in
so well with the air. it also has
the merit of being short and to the
point. The song that won the sec
ond prize, "Rahl llah! Rah!" to
the tune "Coon! Coon! Coon!" is
well written, and deserves commen
dation, the second verse being par
ticularly good. Other songs which
did not appear in the last year's
book are "Stanford Mandalay," by
Miss Morrison, '01, "We Piayed
Hall," to the air of "The Tale of
'the Kangaroo," and"The Toast,"
to the same tune. "Stanford Man
dalay" is well written and deserves
to live. "We Played Ball" is a
rollicking football song with a good
swing to it, and"The loast" de
serves its name; it's a got d toast.
Last year's prize song is reprinted,
as well as "Rush the Ball Along,"
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," "One, Two
Three, Four," and several other
good old songs.
The yell part of the song-book is
not so good this year as usual. The
prize yell is too far-fetched to take
with a crowd or be at all effective.
The old axe yell and "Lusty! Blow!
Blow!", one of our best yells, are
omitted, and the Varsity yell is not
given the place of prominence at
the top of On the whole,
however, the book is excel lent, con
taining in all sixteen songs and
seven yells.
