# Practice Last Night.

### 
Last night Stanford's coaches
put the Varsity and second elevens
through some rather hard practice,
in which both teams showed up re
markably well. Coaches and men
are to he congratulated on the im
provement which has taken place
in the work of both elevens. About
the middle of the season Stanford
could just tie Reliance, and now
she lias beaten the club by a score
which tells only half the story.
At one time the line cmld be
smashed back by bucks as if our
men were half grown boys, but
now it holds in the real, old Var
sity fashion. The backs, too, have
improved. All the men are in
splendid physical condition except
for the bruises and sprains always
found on a heavy team; and will
put into the field tomorrow against
Nevada one of tin* best, teams she
bas'ever cheered on to victory.
The most of the somewhat brief
practice was devoted to bucking
the second team against the Var
sity in order to strengthen further
the linemen and the backs. Fol
lowing Parker's thirty-yard kick
off from the center of the Held, the
Varsity scored a touchdown in
about seven minutes. The ball
was then taken out to the twenty
tive-yard line and given to the sec
ond team to begin its bucking.
Wilbur and Uuttertield made two
desperate attempts to advance the
sphere, but these were stopped by
Clark and Thompson, and Parker
kicked thirty yards to Raitt, who
ran it in forty-five yards, stopping
only at Hauverman's tackle.
Slaker and McFadden followed for
the touchdown. The ball was then
given to the scrubs on the twenty
live-yard line. Smith and Hill
failed to gain on down, and llill
punted twenty-five yards to Craw
ford, who was dropped with no
gain by Paul Tarpey. Tarpey
soon ran barker's twenty-five-yard
kick in ten yards, stopping to Par
ker's tackle, and the Varsity con
tinued to buck until Slaker made
three yards, fumbling to Roosevelt,
who ran it in ten yards to a touch
down, after a twenty-five-yard
series of gains by the Varsity. The

ball was taken lens than twenty
five yards out into the-field, and
after a five-yard end-run by IHit
terfield to a stop by Lee, and a
one-yard gain by Parker through
center, the ball went to the Varsity
on downs. Hill and Parker ex
changed kicks, that of the latter be
ing run in only about five yards
by Raitt, who was dropped by
Hauverman and Wilbur. Hill
made three yards on a straight-in,
and Tarpey ran the right end for
twelve yards, Preston following
With eight, Smith and "Guiby"
Dole for two each, and McFadden
for six yards to a touchdown.
Again it was taken out about tvven
ty-five yards, and the scrubs failed
to gain, Parker kicking to Knight,
who made no gain. Tarpey ran
the second team's right end again
for twenty-five yards until Craw
ford ran him out of bounds, Sinker
and McFadden made tour yards
each, and, after Dole's recovery of
a film hie, Preston made an eighteen
yard run around left end to a
touchdown, avoiding Van Sickle's
fine dive for a tackle. Allen made
the next trip to the goal line after
a series of fumbles by both the
second team and the Varsity, the
former being recovered, but the big
team losing to Parker. The second
team gave up on downs, Traeger,
McFadden, "Guiby" Dole, and
Smith made steady gains, and
Allen a short dash to the touch
down. After this the scrubs were
three times given the ball on the
five-yard line to buck through in
four downs, but they only suc
ceeded once. The line-up:

The cheering on the bleachers
was better than for the last two
nights, and an attempt was made to
sing the football song. It is being
widely asked why the band does
not do some of its practicing in the
bleachers, where its music would
be appreciated.

The cheering on the bleachers
was better than for the last two
nights, and an attempt was made to
sing the football song. It is being
widely asked why the band does
not do some of its practicing in the
bleachers, where its music would
be appreciated.
Last night Stanford's coaches
put the Varsity and second elevens
through some rather hard practice,
in which both teams showed up re
markably well. Coaches and men
are to he congratulated on the im
provement which has taken place
in the work of both elevens. About
the middle of the season Stanford
could just tie Reliance, and now
she lias beaten the club by a score
which tells only half the story.
At one time the line cmld be
smashed back by bucks as if our
men were half grown boys, but
now it holds in the real, old Var
sity fashion. The backs, too, have
improved. All the men are in
splendid physical condition except
for the bruises and sprains always
found on a heavy team; and will
put into the field tomorrow against
Nevada one of tin* best, teams she
bas'ever cheered on to victory.
The most of the somewhat brief
practice was devoted to bucking
the second team against the Var
sity in order to strengthen further
the linemen and the backs. Fol
lowing Parker's thirty-yard kick
off from the center of the Held, the
Varsity scored a touchdown in
about seven minutes. The ball
was then taken out to the twenty
tive-yard line and given to the sec
ond team to begin its bucking.
Wilbur and Uuttertield made two
desperate attempts to advance the
sphere, but these were stopped by
Clark and Thompson, and Parker
kicked thirty yards to Raitt, who
ran it in forty-five yards, stopping
only at Hauverman's tackle.
Slaker and McFadden followed for
the touchdown. The ball was then
given to the scrubs on the twenty
live-yard line. Smith and Hill
failed to gain on down, and llill
punted twenty-five yards to Craw
ford, who was dropped with no
gain by Paul Tarpey. Tarpey
soon ran barker's twenty-five-yard
kick in ten yards, stopping to Par
ker's tackle, and the Varsity con
tinued to buck until Slaker made
three yards, fumbling to Roosevelt,
who ran it in ten yards to a touch
down, after a twenty-five-yard
series of gains by the Varsity. The

ball was taken lens than twenty
five yards out into the-field, and
after a five-yard end-run by IHit
terfield to a stop by Lee, and a
one-yard gain by Parker through
center, the ball went to the Varsity
on downs. Hill and Parker ex
changed kicks, that of the latter be
ing run in only about five yards
by Raitt, who was dropped by
Hauverman and Wilbur. Hill
made three yards on a straight-in,
and Tarpey ran the right end for
twelve yards, Preston following
With eight, Smith and "Guiby"
Dole for two each, and McFadden
for six yards to a touchdown.
Again it was taken out about tvven
ty-five yards, and the scrubs failed
to gain, Parker kicking to Knight,
who made no gain. Tarpey ran
the second team's right end again
for twenty-five yards until Craw
ford ran him out of bounds, Sinker
and McFadden made tour yards
each, and, after Dole's recovery of
a film hie, Preston made an eighteen
yard run around left end to a
touchdown, avoiding Van Sickle's
fine dive for a tackle. Allen made
the next trip to the goal line after
a series of fumbles by both the
second team and the Varsity, the
former being recovered, but the big
team losing to Parker. The second
team gave up on downs, Traeger,
McFadden, "Guiby" Dole, and
Smith made steady gains, and
Allen a short dash to the touch
down. After this the scrubs were
three times given the ball on the
five-yard line to buck through in
four downs, but they only suc
ceeded once. The line-up:
