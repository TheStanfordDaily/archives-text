# NEVADA DEFEATED.
## By a Score of 12 to 0 the Cardinal Triumphs over Her Rival. 
### 
Last {Saturday twelve hundred
people watched the Stanford Var
sity football team defeat the Uni
versity of Nevada by a score of 12
to 0. Stanford scored twice in the
first half, using Slaker through the
center for the first touchdown, and
Hill around Nevada's left end for
the second. Traeger kicked both
goals from Raitt's hold of the ball.
This being the last contest before
the big game, the occasion was the
only one on which the Berkeley
men could see the playing of their
rivals, and every candidate for t this
year's yellow "0" who could get
away from the institution across
the bay was present. Among Stan
ford's guests were YVomble, Over
all, Stowe, Hansen, Duden, Mine,
Braley, Sherman, Albertson, and
Gendatti. There was also a little
band of Nevada enthusiasts who
accompanied their team. When
the rooters were divided into two
sections, these were added to Nar
amore's lusty division, which was
to yell for the visitors. Corbusier
led the Stanford side, and the two
kept up a lively competition. The
red-coated Stanford band was also
on exhibition. It is said that the
band will be at nearly all the prac
tices this week to help with the
singing.
Twenty-five minute halves were
played, and the Stanford team
gave the best possible proof of
their glorious physical condition,
not a man being hurt seriously,
and no one being replaced except
to give another man a chance, hi
the tirst half there were 61 downs,
and Stanford had the ball for 86 of
these, using them for nine kicks by
Hill of 862 yards in all, an average
of over 40 yards to the kick; and
for 25 runs which gained an aggre
gate of 150 yards, an average of
just six yards to the run. Stan
ford was held twice during this half
without gain, and she made no
gain once on a fumble. Her ad
versary had the ball for 25 downs,
using 10 of these for kicks which
aggregate 406 yards, an average as
high as Hill's, and trying runs in
15 of them which gained only 18
yards. She was held without gain
seven times. In this half Stanford
fumbled three times, once by Hill
to Keddie, once by Fisher to the
same man, and once by Traeger to
Leadbetter. Nevada fumbled but
once. On the other hand, Raitt
made six run-ins of Graham's
punts, Slaker two, and Traeger one,
making in all a gain of one hun
dred and seventy-two yards. Ne
vada made no gain by running in
the ball. The only penalty in
flicted during the game was on Ne
vada, five yards for off-side play.
In the second half the visiting
team played better ball, or the
Varsity rested, having shown what
it could do, for neither side scored.
Out of thirty-eight downs the visit
ors had the ball for nineteen trials,
and they used six of these for kick
ing-gains aggregating 215 yards,
an average of 86 yards to the punt,
and 14 downs for runs, in which
they made 37 yards, an average of
less than three yards to the run.

They ran Hill's punts in twice,
once eleven yards by O'Hara to
'arpey, and once for five yards by
Hofmann. Stanford had the ball
for nineteen downs, using five of
these for a gain by kicks of 202
yards,an average of 40 yards to the
punt. The other fourteen downs
were used for runs, on three of
which the big team was held; but
on the other eleven 85 yards were
gained, an average of six yards to
the run. Only one good run-in
was made. I his being by Raitt for
fifteen yards. The home team was
pushed back once for a loss of three
yards, and they lost the ball once
on downs.
Line-up and weights were:
STANFORD. NEVADA.

A more detailed account of the
hest runs: Fisher around Kearn
ey's end for twelve yards; the same
man in the same play for eight
yards; Raitt, t a run-in of Graham's
kick tvventv-six yards, to big
Smith's tackle; a similar run by
the same man for twenty-five yards
to the same tackier; Fisher straight
in for eight yards; Raitt, a twenty
yard run-in of Graham's punt;
Raitt, a thirty-yard run-in of Gra
ham's punt; Slaker and Traeger
each a four-yard gain; Raitt, a
fifteen-yard run-in <>112 a punt; Hill
around \\ right's end for sixteen
yards; Slaker, a ten-yard run-in of
a punt; Fisher, a twenty-one-yard
run around Kearney's end, out of
bounds; Hill, seventeen yards
around Wright's end for a touch
down; aud Traeger, an eleven-yard
run-in of a punt, stopping with
Riordan's tackle. The first touch
down Was made in fourteen min
utes, Hill punting out to Raitt for
position, and Traeger placing the
goal-kick successfully. Slaker's
bucks were steady ground-gainers,
and he made from two to six yards
at a time; moreover, he was never
held for no gain. Traeger did good
work in getting down on Hill's
kicks and stopping up the man who
had caught the bail. Hisend runs
were good, and his whole game was
in Varsity form. The fact that
Nevada made little gain on run
ning in the ball after a punt is
more largely due to Traeger than
any other man on the team.
The longest runs made by the
Nevada men were by Hofmann,
fifteen yards around Stanford's left
end to Slaker's stop; by Riordan,
between center and right guard.

O'Hara ran in a punt eleven yards
to Tarpey, and Hofmann did the
same for five yards shortly after
wards. Jt was noticeable that
Stanford tried no new plays what
ever throughout the entire game.
The whole contest, however, pointed
out one fact: that is, that Stan
ford's team this year is one of the
craftiest and heaviest elevens she
has ever put into the field. They
fully demonstrated that they knew
the game from the first sound of
the whistle till the last buck or
run. The team's only weakness is
in its fumbles. The condition of
the men could not possibly be
better.

sity football team defeat the Uni
versity of Nevada by a score of 12
to 0. Stanford scored twice in the
first half, using Slaker through the
center for the first touchdown, and
Hill around Nevada's left end for
the second. Traeger kicked both
goals from Raitt's hold of the ball.
This being the last contest before
the big game, the occasion was the
only one on which the Berkeley
men could see the playing of their
rivals, and every candidate for t this
year's yellow "0" who could get
away from the institution across
the bay was present. Among Stan
ford's guests were YVomble, Over
all, Stowe, Hansen, Duden, Mine,
Braley, Sherman, Albertson, and
Gendatti. There was also a little
band of Nevada enthusiasts who
accompanied their team. When
the rooters were divided into two
sections, these were added to Nar
amore's lusty division, which was
to yell for the visitors. Corbusier
led the Stanford side, and the two
kept up a lively competition. The
red-coated Stanford band was also
on exhibition. It is said that the
band will be at nearly all the prac
tices this week to help with the
singing.
Twenty-five minute halves were
played, and the Stanford team
gave the best possible proof of
their glorious physical condition,
not a man being hurt seriously,
and no one being replaced except
to give another man a chance, hi
the tirst half there were 61 downs,
and Stanford had the ball for 86 of
these, using them for nine kicks by
Hill of 862 yards in all, an average
of over 40 yards to the kick; and
for 25 runs which gained an aggre
gate of 150 yards, an average of
just six yards to the run. Stan
ford was held twice during this half
without gain, and she made no
gain once on a fumble. Her ad
versary had the ball for 25 downs,
using 10 of these for kicks which
aggregate 406 yards, an average as
high as Hill's, and trying runs in
15 of them which gained only 18
yards. She was held without gain
seven times. In this half Stanford
fumbled three times, once by Hill
to Keddie, once by Fisher to the
same man, and once by Traeger to
Leadbetter. Nevada fumbled but
once. On the other hand, Raitt
made six run-ins of Graham's
punts, Slaker two, and Traeger one,
making in all a gain of one hun
dred and seventy-two yards. Ne
vada made no gain by running in
the ball. The only penalty in
flicted during the game was on Ne
vada, five yards for off-side play.
In the second half the visiting
team played better ball, or the
Varsity rested, having shown what
it could do, for neither side scored.
Out of thirty-eight downs the visit
ors had the ball for nineteen trials,
and they used six of these for kick
ing-gains aggregating 215 yards,
an average of 86 yards to the punt,
and 14 downs for runs, in which
they made 37 yards, an average of
less than three yards to the run.

They ran Hill's punts in twice,
once eleven yards by O'Hara to
'arpey, and once for five yards by
Hofmann. Stanford had the ball
for nineteen downs, using five of
these for a gain by kicks of 202
yards,an average of 40 yards to the
punt. The other fourteen downs
were used for runs, on three of
which the big team was held; but
on the other eleven 85 yards were
gained, an average of six yards to
the run. Only one good run-in
was made. I his being by Raitt for
fifteen yards. The home team was
pushed back once for a loss of three
yards, and they lost the ball once
on downs.

A more detailed account of the
hest runs: Fisher around Kearn
ey's end for twelve yards; the same
man in the same play for eight
yards; Raitt, t a run-in of Graham's
kick tvventv-six yards, to big
Smith's tackle; a similar run by
the same man for twenty-five yards
to the same tackier; Fisher straight
in for eight yards; Raitt, a twenty
yard run-in of Graham's punt;
Raitt, a thirty-yard run-in of Gra

each a four-yard gain; Raitt, a
fifteen-yard run-in <>112 a punt; Hill
around \\ right's end for sixteen
yards; Slaker, a ten-yard run-in of
a punt; Fisher, a twenty-one-yard
run around Kearney's end, out of
bounds; Hill, seventeen yards
around Wright's end for a touch
down; aud Traeger, an eleven-yard
run-in of a punt, stopping with
Riordan's tackle. The first touch
down Was made in fourteen min
utes, Hill punting out to Raitt for
position, and Traeger placing the
goal-kick successfully. Slaker's
bucks were steady ground-gainers,
and he made from two to six yards
at a time; moreover, he was never
held for no gain. Traeger did good
work in getting down on Hill's
kicks and stopping up the man who
had caught the bail. Hisend runs
were good, and his whole game was
in Varsity form. The fact that
Nevada made little gain on run
ning in the ball after a punt is
more largely due to Traeger than
any other man on the team.
The longest runs made by the
Nevada men were by Hofmann,
fifteen yards around Stanford's left
end to Slaker's stop; by Riordan,
between center and right guard.

O'Hara ran in a punt eleven yards
to Tarpey, and Hofmann did the
same for five yards shortly after
wards. Jt was noticeable that
Stanford tried no new plays what
ever throughout the entire game.
The whole contest, however, pointed
out one fact: that is, that Stan
ford's team this year is one of the
craftiest and heaviest elevens she
has ever put into the field. They
fully demonstrated that they knew
the game from the first sound of
the whistle till the last buck or
run. The team's only weakness is
in its fumbles. The condition of
the men could not possibly be
better.
