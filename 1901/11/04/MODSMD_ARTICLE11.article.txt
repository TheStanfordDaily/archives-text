Ik Stanford's rooting cohorts are
to make a creditable showing
against those of California next
Saturday, the bulk of our work in
that direction must he done this
week. Hampered as much by apa
thy as by lack of song-books, we
are approaching the crucial mo
ment with about as much force be
hind our songs and slogans as
would be expected in a preparatory
school, instead of in a college
where seven hundred men are sup
posed to possess lungs of true West
ern lustiness. But recrimination
may yet he avoided. Nearly a
week is before us in which to make
our efforts all the stronger for past
neglect. Tomorrow night a song
practice is announced to take place
in the chapel, to be followed by
others on the bleachers and else
where. Day in and day out, for
nine weeks, the football men have
given their best to the University;
it is to our shame if we fail to do
our little part.
