Stanford is again victorious.
We salute tiie team which won this
new honor for us. It deserves more

praise than we can give. Although
we expected a victory, its realiza
tion is none the less gratifying.
Each individual player in the game
deserves commendation. We are
proud of our graduate coaches who
have taught this team the game,
and we are exceedingly grateful to
the second team men who have
given it the practice without which
victory were impossible.
