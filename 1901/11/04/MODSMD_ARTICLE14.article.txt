Only a few years ago we sent our
second team against the University
of Nevada. Now, when we contest
with the football men from that in
stitution, our Varsity usually finds
a hard game. We are glad of the
opportunity to meet the men from
a neighboring university, and we
regret that they could not be here
a few hours longer so that we
might have expressed more fully
this appreciation.
