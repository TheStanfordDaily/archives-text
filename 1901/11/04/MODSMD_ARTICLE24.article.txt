# BASEBALL OUTLOOK.
## Call for Old and New Men Who Are Candidates for Varsity. 
### 
Captain Cowden of the baseball
team has decided to call out pros
pective candidates for next year's
team, and just as soon as the foot
ball season is finished he will issue
a call for both old and new men.
It is the intention at the present
time to have about a week of prac
tice this fall. In that time a good
idea of the new men can be gotten
and something definite can be as
certained about our prospects for
the spring. There are several new
men here this year who have come
with some baseball experience, and
it is hoped that some of this
material will develop to fill capably
the positions left vacant by Ball,
Misner, Edwards, Murphy, and
Symonds. The decision of Ball not
to return to college will mean a
serious handicap to the team. In
his position as catcher he showed
himself one of the pluckiest play
ers on last year's team. His batting
was very good and his base throw
ing excellent. His place will be
hard to fill. Traeger made a good
try for the position last year, and
the coming season will in all prob
ability find him the foremost can
didate.
Barker will continue to hold
down the pitcher's box, while Cap
tain Cowden will admirably take
care of the initial bag.
Misner, who played second base
last year, is at present working in
New Jersey. It has been his in
tention to return to college at
Christmas, but it is not known for
a certainty yet whether he will do
so. If he does not return the three
remaining places on the infield will
have to be tilled by new material.
Of the outfield, Symond's place
in center field is alone vacant, Ben
nett and Brown both having re
turned. The old men now in col
lege who will be out next year are
Young, Ballagh, Tritch, Lowen
thai, Traeger, Crawford, Geissler,
Knight, and Copp.
"Doc" Murphy's resignation as
coach makes the selection of a new
man necessary, and a choice of a
man will probably be made in a
short time.
