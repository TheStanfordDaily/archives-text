# ROOTERS' MEETING
## Monster Song Practice for Men of University in Chapel Tomorrow Evening. 
### 
Tomorrow evening in the chapel
a monster song practice its t > be held,
which every man in the University
in expected to attend. Action will
commence at 7:15 o'clock and con
tinue until 8:00. So no one need
stay away for fear of its breaking
into study hours. All the songs
and yells to be used at Saturday's
game will he tried. The words of
the prize song, of "Rush the Ball
Along", of "After the Game," and
of "One, Two. Three, Four," should
be well committed by this time, but
song-books must not be forgotten.
Yell-leaders Naramore and Oorbu
sier will both be present, the band
will accompany the singers, and
every man who intends to go to the
city, whether he has a rooting sec
tion ticket or not, is expected U>
turn out to the practice without
furl her notice. Our efforts in this
line have been rather mediocre thus
far, but five days are left, which will
work wonders if each one gets in
the interference.
