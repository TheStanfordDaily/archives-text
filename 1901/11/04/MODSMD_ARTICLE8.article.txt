## 
### 
The reception Saturday afternoon
in honor of Mrs. Stanford by the
faculty of the University was one
of the largest affairs ever given at
the University. The decorations,
which were in charge of Mr. and
Mrs. Nash, Mr. and Mrs. Dodge,
and I'rofessors Ahhott, Goebel, and
Clark, were among the finest that
have ever been placed in the En
ema club room.
In the center of the room was an
imitation of one of the flower beds
in the quadrangle, which gave a
most pleasing effect and broke the
largeness of the room. The lobby
and stairway were converted into a
veritable bower with palms, fiow
ers, branches, and potted plants.
The windows were all darkened,
a'nd llie electric lights shaded by
led (issue paper gave an evening
appearance to the scene.
Mrs. Stanford, assisted by Dr.
and Mrs. Jordan, Dr. and Mrs.
Brainier, Dr. and Mrs. Stillman,
Dr. and Mrs. Angell, and Dr. and
Mrs. Nash, received the guests near
the club room fireplace. Excellent
music was rendered during the en
tire afternoon. Brook's orchestra
of San Francisco gave some beauti
ful selections from recent popular
operas. The University Glee Club,
the Uirls' Glee Club, and the Man
dolin Club also assisted in the pro
gram with some delightful num
bers. Refreshments were served in
the second floor parlor and hall
way by pretty co-eds in charge of
Mrs. Brainier. Several prominent
people from out of town attended
the reception. Mrs. Stanford
seemed delighted with her welcome
and was most gracious to the stu
dents and faculty. The reception
was in all ways successful and
doubtless most pleasing to our
benefactress on her home-coming
from foreign countries.
