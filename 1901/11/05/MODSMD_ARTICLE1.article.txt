# FOOTBALL RALLY.
## Rousing Send-off for the Football Players in the Assembly Hall Wednesday Night. 
### 
The annual monster football
rally will take pla.ceon Wednesday
evening, November Gth. The rally
will occur in the Assembly Hall, the
doors will be opened at 7:30 and the
program will commence at 8:00 p.m.
The team will be there, the rooters
will be expected to turn out in full
force to jolly up the men, and the
women should come and help swell
the crowd.
Dr. Jordan will speak and Profes
sor Hurt Estes Howard will give
one of his interesting talks. The rally
is given Wednesday night instead
of Friday at the request of the
coaches. It will be our last chance
before the game to show the men
our appreciation of their work for
the University, and every one
should make a special effort to be
present. A good rally does much
to inspire football men with the
Stanford spirit of lighting hard and
winning against odds.
The downstairs of the Assembly
Hall will be reserved for the men of
the University, and the first rows
especially are to be occupied by the
rooters. Every one in the Univer
sity should come. Bring your song
books, get there early, and give
the football team a. rousing big
send-off.
