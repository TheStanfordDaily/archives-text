Living at one of the best dormi
tories in the world, nearly one-half
the residents of Eneina Hall hoard
at a third-class Chinese restaurant.
Not only does this jeopardize the
health of those who eat such food
as they get, hut it neutralizes the
atmosphere of culture with which
men are supposed to he surrounded
at a university. A definite propo
sition has now heen made hy the
University management to rent
the Inn for a co-operative eating
cluh which should he in a position
to furnish first-class board at a
minimum figure. This plan suc
ceeds at other institutions, and
there is no reason why it should
not be made a permanent factor of
our community here, becoming one
of the most important elements for
the meeting and mingling of stu
dents. The University manage
ment refuses to take the responsi
bility of conducting such an enter
prise, upon the ground that it will
not be judged by the quality of
food put forth, and that, since the
students receive everything in the
way of education without cost, they
should be willing to provide board.
The proposition is offered. The
plan is practicable, if carefully or
ganized. The situation is critical,
not only for the present year, but
it may have an important hearing
on the future. Will the students
seize their opportunity?
