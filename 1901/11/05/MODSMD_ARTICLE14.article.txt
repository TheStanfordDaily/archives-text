# Walter Camp on Football.

### 
In an article it) the November
number of Outing, Walter Camp
discusses the football outlook for
the season 1901. Mr. Camp was
graduated from Yale in 1880, and
is called the father of American
football. He was the first coach
Stanford ever had, being here dur
ing the seasons of 1892, 1893, and
1895. Mr. Camp is a recognized
authority on football, and writes
with excellent discrimination of the
various teams in America.
He says that the teams in the
East with the exception of Yale,
which was phenomenally successful
last year, all are trying to develop
new styles of playing; while in the
Middle West, lowa and Minnesota
will probably contest for the high
est honor. The following is what
he says about football on the Coast
in closing his article:
"Out on the Pacific Slope the
same old rivalry prevails between
Stanford and the University of
California, Stanford winning last
year in what proved to be a fairly
exciting match, i bis year Fickert,
the former captain of Stanford, is
the head coach, and he has the as
sistance of more recent Stanford
players. This is one of the early
steps on the Coast towards break
ing up the importation of Eastern
coaches, and if the men have learned
their lesson properly, they should
now be able to handle matters them
selves. On the other hand they
must develop, or in the course of
two or three years, simply playing
with each other, Berkeley and Stan
ford will drop back as far in the
rear of the sport on the Eastern
seaboard us they were before the
advent of the Eastern coach Their
game has been well built up and
the change ought not to prove seri
ous, save in the tendency to indi
vidual rivalry among the different
graduate elements.
"It is most improbable that the
style of play at either University
will be markedly altered this season,
but whether the game will develop
is another question, and one that
only a season's actual work can
answer.
"Taking the sport broadly
throughout the country, it was
never so well rounded out. As in
our tennis, there may be mono
maniacs on certain methods, but,
as in that game neither the back
court player nor the wild net rusher
can defeat the all-round player,
so, in football the team that has
forgotten kicking in a mad concen
tration upon a new mass attack
will lose to the better generaled
forces of the adversary who kicks
and runs as occasion demands.
"The one disappointing outlook
is the continued necessity of heavy
men; for a heavy line is still an
essential, as it lias been for five
years or more. But this is on the
principle that prevails in so many
of the sports that a good 'big one'
will always beat a good 'little one,'
and no one has yet discovered an
effective remedy."
