# Practice Last Night.
## 
### 
A first half of sixteen minutes
long and a second of ten'minutes
were played last night at the regu
lar Varsity practice. The big team
scored two touchdowns on its oppo
nents, one by A. R. Dole in six
minutes and the other by Hill in
ten minutes after the ball was
given to the second team on its
live-yard line. The Varsity showed
that it was in the very pink of
condition, and every play was
snappy and vigorous. Out of six
ty-one downs the Varsity hud the
ball for thirty-four chances, al
though their opponents were given
five downs in which to make their
distance. The big team used no
kicks whatever and was held only
once with no gain. It lost the ball
once on downs. Only one fumble
was made, this being by Bansbach
to Hayden. Thirty-three runs
were made, aggregating 150 yards,
an average of almost five yards to
the buck. The second team kicked
three times, each a little over
thirty yards. Parker made one
punt which fell short, and the sec
ond team fullback recovered his
own kick. The scrubs tried twen
ty-four runs, aggregating fifty
yards, fumbled three times, were
held for no gain five times, and
were pushed back three times, Kuhn
by Traeger, Parker by McFadden,
and Sefton by Thompson. The
evening was marked by the addi
tion of four men to the training
table, Preston, Butterfield, Tarpey,
and Van Sickle. Preston is a pole
vaulter and broad-juniper, and his
game at end has been fast and con
sistent. Van Sickle and Tarpey
were respectively left guard and
left halfback on this year's winning
Freshman team. The work of both
has been up to Varsity form for
almost the entire season. Butter
field becomes a Stanford "falling
star" from a steady and silent,
player of the game on last year's
second team. Just now he is play
ing his position better than any
end on the field, Cooper being still
disabled by his ankle. Butter
field's tackling is away above par,
this being his strong point.
Last night's best runs were:
Hill around Wilbur's end for ten
yards; Slaker through center for
five yards; Smith, six yards on
right end; A. It. Dole, center buck
for five yards; Traeger in a ''tackle
across" for eight yards; Doherty
straight in for nine yards; Wilbur
twelve yards around Varsity left
end; Clark, on Wilbur's end, seven
yards; Hill nine yards past Sefton;
Slaker twenty yards past left end;
Parker nine yards between right
guard and center; and Preston
eight yards past right end.
