# PROPOSITION SUBMITTED.
## Management Will Lease the Inn to a Co-operative Organization of Students. 
### 
It lookB as if the eating problem
for residents of Encina may be
solved. After a conference yester
day afternoon with Mrs. Stanford,
Dr. Jordan announced that the
Inn would be rented to an associa
tion of students to conduct it as a
large eating club similar to those
existing at Eastern institutions.
As a mutter of principle, Mrs. Stan
ford feels that all the money de
voted to the University should go
into educational channels, and she
has placed the rental at a mini
mum which will produce a small
return on the capital invested in
the building.
This evening a meeting of the
Encina Club will be held after the
song practice, at which the propo
sition will be stated, and a com
mittee will probably be appointed
to formulate some definite scheme
of procedure. The plan now dis
cussed contemplates the employ
men I of a caterer, who would have
charge of the buying, preparation,

and serving of the food. A regular
rate for board for the first month
would be fixed for those wishing to
become members of the club, and
the amount of the caterer's com
pensation would be made to depend
upon the number of regular board
ers, thus offering him an incentive
to serve good, attractive fare as
reasonably as possible; for the rate
charged the student would be de
signed to cover the bare cost of
rent, salaries, and supplies. To
carry out any such plan, aboard
of directors would be necessary, but
the members should receive no
salary, so as to obviate any danger
of politics entering into the man
agement.
If a committee is appointed this
evening the situation will be can
vassed thoroughly for the purpose
of ascertaining the best method of
organization, the probable expense
of management and cost of board,
and the number of men who would
he willing to join such an associa
tion. In the neighborhood of one
hundred of the men living at the
hall now board at the Chinese res
taurant in the Camp. No doubt
most of these would go into the
new club, thus insuring a substan
tial membership from the outset.
Among the phases of the question
to be considered is the transient
trade, which, if properly handled,
might he productive of some rev
enue.
The most successful boarding

houses and clubs at the big Eastern
universities are those conducted on
the co-operative basis. Memorial
Hall, on the university commons
at Harvard, is run something on
this plan. The university hires a
man at so much a month to pre
pare the meals. There is no stu
dent labor. The students pay be
tween $3.50 and $4.00 per week for
board and the university gets the
profit, though the business is so run
that there is no profit. The meals
are excellent and the places at the
table are all tilled. Fox Hall,
Harvard, is conducted on a sim
ilar plan—although student labor
is employed, and the board is
somewhat cheaper.
At Wesleyan University, Mid
dleton, Conn., an eating club was
organized several years ago with a
membership of about thirty, which
soon increased to over one hundred,
owing to the low price of board,
$2.85, and its excellent quality.
Here a matron was given charge of
the club, for which the university
was responsible and not the stu
dents. The club was so successful
that at the end of the year a sum
averaging twenty-five cents per

week was refunded to each mem
ber. The university took a pride
in seeing that the hoard wms good
and reasonable. At Illinois, a
caterer serves an excellent quality
of food to many of the students in
the basement of one of the univer
sity buildings; the cost is very rea
sonable. Smaller clubs exist at
Wisconsin, Yale, and several other
institutions.
There were two clubs of many
years' standing of about sixty
members at Andover, Mass. At
the beginning of the semester the
club elected four officers —presi-
dent, vice-president, secretary, and
treasurer. The treasurer bought
all supplies and contracted for
room in which the eating club met
and for the cooking. Meals were
held in the same place year after
year. At the beginning of the
school year the president appointed
three members of the club to draw
up a bill-of-fare. The committee
drafted the bill-of-fare for every
day for the week. Treasurer then
made his figures as to how much
money the food Vequired and re
ported the amount next day. One
half the amount was then paid and
at the middle of the semester the
balance was due and paid. Hoard
ran from $3.50 to $4.00 per week.
Dr. Abbott says the club set the
best table he ever ate at. The clubs
were entirely democratic and the
school administration had nothing
whatever to do with them.

table are all tilled. Fox Hall,
Harvard, is conducted on a sim
ilar plan—although student labor
is employed, and the board is
somewhat cheaper.
At Wesleyan University, Mid
dleton, Conn., an eating club was
organized several years ago with a
membership of about thirty, which
soon increased to over one hundred,
owing to the low price of board,
$2.85, and its excellent quality.
Here a matron was given charge of
the club, for which the university
was responsible and not the stu
dents. The club was so successful
that at the end of the year a sum
averaging twenty-five cents per

week was refunded to each mem
ber. The university took a pride
in seeing that the hoard wms good
and reasonable. At Illinois, a
caterer serves an excellent quality
of food to many of the students in
the basement of one of the univer
sity buildings; the cost is very rea
sonable. Smaller clubs exist at
Wisconsin, Yale, and several other
institutions.
There were two clubs of many
years' standing of about sixty
members at Andover, Mass. At
the beginning of the semester the
club elected four officers —presi-
dent, vice-president, secretary, and
treasurer. The treasurer bought
all supplies and contracted for
room in which the eating club met
and for the cooking. Meals were
held in the same place year after
year. At the beginning of the
school year the president appointed
three members of the club to draw
up a bill-of-fare. The committee
drafted the bill-of-fare for every
day for the week. Treasurer then
made his figures as to how much
money the food Vequired and re
ported the amount next day. One
half the amount was then paid and
at the middle of the semester the
balance was due and paid. Hoard
ran from $3.50 to $4.00 per week.
Dr. Abbott says the club set the
best table he ever ate at. The clubs
were entirely democratic and the
school administration had nothing
whatever to do with them.

It lookB as if the eating problem
for residents of Encina may be
solved. After a conference yester
day afternoon with Mrs. Stanford,
Dr. Jordan announced that the
Inn would be rented to an associa
tion of students to conduct it as a
large eating club similar to those
existing at Eastern institutions.
As a mutter of principle, Mrs. Stan
ford feels that all the money de
voted to the University should go
into educational channels, and she
has placed the rental at a mini
mum which will produce a small
return on the capital invested in
the building.
This evening a meeting of the
Encina Club will be held after the
song practice, at which the propo
sition will be stated, and a com
mittee will probably be appointed
to formulate some definite scheme
of procedure. The plan now dis
cussed contemplates the employ
men I of a caterer, who would have
charge of the buying, preparation,

and serving of the food. A regular
rate for board for the first month
would be fixed for those wishing to
become members of the club, and
the amount of the caterer's com
pensation would be made to depend
upon the number of regular board
ers, thus offering him an incentive
to serve good, attractive fare as
reasonably as possible; for the rate
charged the student would be de
signed to cover the bare cost of
rent, salaries, and supplies. To
carry out any such plan, aboard
of directors would be necessary, but
the members should receive no
salary, so as to obviate any danger
of politics entering into the man
agement.
If a committee is appointed this
evening the situation will be can
vassed thoroughly for the purpose
of ascertaining the best method of
organization, the probable expense
of management and cost of board,
and the number of men who would
he willing to join such an associa
tion. In the neighborhood of one
hundred of the men living at the
hall now board at the Chinese res
taurant in the Camp. No doubt
most of these would go into the
new club, thus insuring a substan
tial membership from the outset.
Among the phases of the question
to be considered is the transient
trade, which, if properly handled,
might he productive of some rev
enue.
The most successful boarding

houses and clubs at the big Eastern
universities are those conducted on
the co-operative basis. Memorial
Hall, on the university commons
at Harvard, is run something on
this plan. The university hires a
man at so much a month to pre
pare the meals. There is no stu
dent labor. The students pay be
tween $3.50 and $4.00 per week for
board and the university gets the
profit, though the business is so run
that there is no profit. The meals
are excellent and the places at the
table are all tilled. Fox Hall,
