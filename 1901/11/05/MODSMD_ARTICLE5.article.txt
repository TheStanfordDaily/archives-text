# ENTHUSIASTIC PRACTICE.
## Varsity Good on Offensive, Fair on Defensive, and Fumbled Wretchedly. 
### 
There was all kinds of enthusi
asm at tonight's practice. The
hand was out in force, and Yell
leader Nararaore stirred the bleach
ers into a string of rousing yells
and songs.
The beautiful part of the Var
sity's work consisted of their inter
ference, which took liill around
the end for two long gains, Smith
for a run of twenty yards, and
lioosevelt for a touchdown, within
live minutes from the time the ball
was put in play. The defense of
the Varsity was not so good, and
there was some inexcusable fum
bling, but the general work was of
a character to cheer the hearts of
those who pray for a Cardinal vic
tory. Of the individual work,
Turpey's tackling was notable.
