# LAST LINE-UP.
## Stanford's Varsity and Second Team Face Each Other for the Last Time. 
### 
"I am satisfied with the condi
tion of the team and the ball that
they play," said Coach Fickert
after tonight's short practice. This
is the last line-up that the team
will have until they face the men of
Berkeley. The head coach's final
word upon the season's results is
therefore gratifying to the Cardinal
supporters.
The work of the Varsity in to
night's scrimmage was better in
many ways than it was on the pre
ceding afternoon. The defense was
stronger, the offense was just as
headstrong and compact, and there
was only one disastrous fumble.
Hill, Smith, Roosevelt, Tarpey, and
Traeger swung the ends and
plunged through the lines for a
number of good gains. The team
was also together on every play.
There are now no cripples on the
team, and there is no longer chance
for injuries. The rest of the week
will he occupied in secret signal
practice. The team was given only
one cheer by the bleachers, which
is lamentable.
