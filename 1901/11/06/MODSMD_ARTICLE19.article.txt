# UNIVERSITY TENNIS.
## Men Practicing for Spring Tournament. Prospects for Intercollegiate Contests Next Semester. 
### 
The tennis courts are being used
regularly by a number of those who
have hopes of making the intercol
legiate team. Harry Weihe, Harry
Boyle, C. M. Baker, U. G. Gage, R.
Leib, F. Leib, H. Hall, and A. B.
Watson, who were in last years'
tournament are out; also A. B.
Hooper and C. B. Hooper, two fresh
men who are working hard, with
chances of developing into varsity
form. The team will probably have
to come out of the old players, as
nothing exceptional has shown up
from among the new men. The
winner of first place in the spring
tournament has the privelege of
playing the winner of the tourna
ment of the next season only, the
two making the intercollegiate team
in the singles; but Rothe being
absent this year, the tournament
must be held for both first and
second places. These will probably
not be played until next semester.
Every tennis player in the Uni
versity should come at once to a
proper appreciation of the difficult
ies which we must overcome in case
we win from Berkeley next spring.
Across the bay are McGavin, Hunt,
Braly, Hendriks,and Brown. They
outclass our men at present, and to
heat them we must do harder work
than they, train better, and practice
more.
