# Yesterday's Practice.
## 
### 
Liist night about 800 people saw
Stanford's "red heap of heroes" in
their lasthard practice before the big
game. Enthusiasm ran high and
the team was cheered as it lias
never been before at a practice.
The band wits also out in a bleacher
rehearsal and added much to the
intenseness of the play, bringing
the men up on their toes as nothing
but music can do.
The Varsity scored three touch
downs on the second team, using
Slaker, Roosevelt and Tarpey, but
they did it in a contest in which
they were penalized sixty yards for
off-side play, losing the ball once by
it; they fumbled twice, once by
Smith and once by Hill; they were
pushed back once for ten yards,
Smith carrying the ball; they lost
the ball once on downs; and they
gained it once on downs on their
twelve-yard line, having been
pushed back by Dole's, Kennedy's,
and Doherty's bucks between right
guard and tackle, and by the pen
alties inflicted on them for off-side
play. Out of a total of seventy
nine downs the big team had the
ball for only thirty-two chances,
kicking twice, once for forty yards
and once for fifty-five yards, and
trying twenty-seven runs, aggre
gating two hundred and fifty-seven
yards, an average of over nine
yards to the run. They only made
one run-in, of fifteen yards, by
R a i 11.
The second team kicked four
times, gaining thereby one hundred
and thirty-five yards, an avernge
of thirty-three yards to the buck.
Their twenty-nine runs aggregated
ninety-one yards, and they fum
bled three times, twice by Doherty
and once by Kenned)'. They were
held eight times with no gain and
lost the ball once on downs. Ken
nedy was pushed back twice, once
by Traeger for two yards, and once
by Roosevelt for one yard. Craw
ford ran the ball in twice, once for

fifteen yards to Thompson, and
once for six yards to Tarpey.
The best plays were: Doherty,
seventeen yards straight in; Sefton,
six yards around the Varsity right
end; Smith, thirty yards around
Sefton's end; Hill, fifteen yards
around the other Bide; Slaker, six
yards through center to Parker;
Traeger, seven yards in a "tackle
back" to Parker; McFadden, in the
same play, for nine yards; Roose
velt, sixteen yards in the same
play; McFadden, in the same play,
for ten yards; Hill, in a twelve
yard end run; Roosevelt, in a
•'tackle hack" for twenty yards to a
touchdown; Dole, in between the
Varsity right guard and tackle, for
eight yards; Kennedy, straight in
for ten yards; and Tarpey around
Knight's end for a sixty-yard dash
to a touchdown, dodging or
straight-arming every one of the
second team backs in his sprint.
