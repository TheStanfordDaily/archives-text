# Song Circulars.
## 
### 
Owing to the I urge demand for
song-books over the number
printed, nix hundred and fifty,
Yell-leader Naramore has ordered
four hundred circulars for Satur
day's game. These will contain
only the principal songs. They
will be distributed on the bleach
ers Saturday, so no one will have
an excuse for not singing. Every
one is urged, however, to take a
song-hook, as four hundred circu
lars will not supply twelve hundred
students.
