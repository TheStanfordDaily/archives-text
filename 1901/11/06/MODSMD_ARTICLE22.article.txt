# New Gymnasium Apparatus.
## 
### 
Encina gymnasium has just re
ceived a new machine, Sayres
suspension apparatus, for the treat
ment of curvatures of the spine,
and five new mats. The mats are:
one ten, two eight, and two five
feet long, but they are not as good
a quality as ordered, being too soft
and light for ordinary use.
