# AT HARVARD.
## How Memorial and Randall Halls Are Conducted on Co-operative Basis. 
### 
In view of the movement to start
the Inn on a cooperative basis, the
following article, condensed from a
recent number of the Saturday
Evening Post, is given in the hope
that it will prove interesting, if not
suggestive.
"The two great eating-houses at
Harvard —Memorial Hall and
Randall Hall —together feed over
two thousand students a meal.
"Memorial Hall, the older and
larger of the two, accommodates
eight hundred men at one time.
It is run by the Harvard Dining
Association, a purely cooperative
affair, on the 'American plan,'
with an 'extra list.' The associa
tion is composed of all who eat at
Memorial Hall; anyone connected
with the university may join, and
it elects from the student body a
president and directors, whoseduties
consist solely in seeing that matters
go smoothly, and in engaging the
auditor and steward, who in their
turn see to the general running of
the establishment.
"The object of the association is
to provide good board cheaply.
The food as a rule is good, and the
price is always about four dollars
a week. If the price of board does
not go above that figure, the
steward receives a bonus, called
'head money' of two and a half
cents from every student, for that
week. How carefully and exactly
things are managed is shown in a
week's board itemized by the aud
itor as follows, the items being for
one student for one week: Pro
visions, $2.68; service, .76; coal,
.07; water, .02; gas, .03; crockery,
.04; interests on loan, .07; reduc
tion of debt, .03; repairs, .05; al
lowances for Sunday absences, .13;
miscellaneous, .06; head money for
steward, total, $3.96i.
"The following figures for one
week show the amount of food con
sumed, meat, 25,900 lbs.; fish,
1,120 lbs.; potatoes, 125 bu.; ap
ples, 16 bbls.; coffee, 150 lbs.; eggs,
1,100 doz.; vegetables, 15 bbls.;
milk, 2,000 gal.; flour, '20 bbls.;
salt, 60 bills.
"The kitchen, which is in the
basement, is wonderful to behold
on account of the size of its ovens,
kettles, and utensils. For instance,
one of the soup-kettles has a ca
pacity of one hundred ten gallons,
another of eighty. The roasting
oven will contain ninety-four huge
pans and is capable of cooking at
one time one thousand eight hun
dred pounds of meat. Each day
the bakers produce eight thousand
four hundred rolls, eight thousand
four hundred niufliins, and twenty
four loaves of bread, not to men
tion one thousand four hundred
pies and quantities of other things.
"The laundry work, too, is done
in the basement, and each day
there goes forth from it one hundred
fifteen clean tablecloths and three
thousand six hundred sixty nap
k ins.
"Each week about two hundred
twenty-five dollars comes back from
the sale of bones and grease. The
good broken food is sold
every morning at ten cents a
basket and nets over one hundred
dollars.
"Besides the vast amount of
food consumed on the regular
American plan, there is the 'extra'
order list, consisting largely of

delicacies. During last year six
teen thousand six hundred sixty
six dollars and eighty-five cents
was collected on these 'extras.'
This same year the regular hoard
charges amount to $165,323.20,
making $181,990.05 in all.
"Randall Hall, like Memorial, is
a co-operative scheme, and is under
the student management of the
Randall Hall Association. It is
run entirely on the 'European
plan' and numbers ahout nine
hundred and forty members. The
object of the association is to pro
vide a place where the poorer stu
dents can live at even less cost
than at Memorial. The kitchen
and laundries are on the same gi
gantic scale as at the other hall.
"Connected with Randall Hall is
the diet kitchen service, which
sends out meals to students con
fined to their rooms. This is an
excellent institution, for the food
is good, and the service inexpensive
and prompt."
