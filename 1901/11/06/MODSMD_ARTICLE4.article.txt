# California Practice.
## 
### 
The practice of the U. C. football
squad Tuesday evening was un
usually hard and spirited. The
varsity went into the play with
great snap and determination.
Three touchdowns were made
against the second eleven without
intermission. Cains were made
principally by long runs by
Womble and More, with good in
terference. The hopes of the Cali
fornia partisans were raised sev
eral degrees by the showing made
by the team. The six additional
coaches behind .the line probably
had a good deal to do with it,.
Besides head coach Simpson and
assistant Hopper there was
Whipple, tackle and captain in '99;
Cadwalader, the former Yale center
and Olympic Club captain; Gam
mon, halfback last year; Clay, of
the '99 and '00 teams; Thane, of
the '98. team; Scott, of Yale; and
Kerfoot.
