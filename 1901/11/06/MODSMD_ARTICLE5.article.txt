# STUDENTS' GUILD.
## Aims and Purposes and Financial Condition of the Organization. 
### 
For the benefit of persons desir
ous of knowing the aims and pur
poses of the Students' Guild, the
directors desire to express briefly
what is the scope of the Guild's
work. First, it is not an accident
assurance company, nor does it
propose to furnish the services of a
physician for every person afflicted
with a slight cold. There are, how
ever, in room 50, Encina Hall, and
at Miss Ray's room, Iloble Hall,
emergency supplies andsomeof the
simpler medicines, such as quinine,
which may be had by Guild mem
bers 011 application.
The Guild is primarily a charit
able organization. In cases of
acute illness where the sufferer is
not financially able to pay hospital
expenses, the Guild will make the
necessary arrangements for his care
at Lane Hospital and will advance
money to pay for the services be
receives until his recovery. In re
turn for this the party so benefited
is expected to sign a 11011 interest
bearing note for the amount ad
vanced, to be paid off at his con
venience.
Dr. Wilbur will act in the ca
pacity of a consulting physician,
and only upon his recommenda
tion will members be cared for by
the Guild.
The ultimate aim of the Guild is
to arrange some sort of hospital ac
commodations on the campus, and
with this object in view the direc
tors expect the support of the col
lege community.
