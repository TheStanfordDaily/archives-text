# Last Night's Song Practice.
## 
### 
Enthusiastic song practice was
heid in the small chapel last night
as a preliminary to the big rally
at the Assembly Hall this evening.
The hand was on the scene early to
start the noise and to accompany
the singing.
The new songs and some of the
old ones were gone over with real
enthusiasm, under the lead of Nar
amore and Whitaker. An effect
will he made if the rooting section
will remember its cue for rising and
waving the red caps at appropriate
places in the fjongs.
Having uncorked the noise, the
leaders at one time had trouble to
keep it in check. Without any ap
parent reason mob spirit seized the
crowd, and everyone giving out his
feelings in a different way the
chapel was a scene of disorder.
Books went into the air and every
man went hoarse. It was a case of
"loosen up" all around, and anyone
could see what lungs will be capa
ble of next Saturday.
To accompany Beebe's "Toast"
and the song "Rah! Rah! Rah!"
both of which are catching on in
the wake of Thomas' prize song,
Charles Richards was called to the
piano. The band has promised
that it too will fall into line to
night. A medley of well-known
tunes in which the rooters can join
was played and found very effective.
It is understood that any Stan
ford fellow attending the rally to
night in the gallery with a co-ed
will be properly saluted.
