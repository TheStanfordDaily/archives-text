# NEARING THE CLIMAX.
## Varsity is in the Pink of Condition and is Playing the Best Ball of the Season. 
### 
The last scrimmage is over and
the work of the men upon whom
Stanford has placed her hope is
practically finished. Today's work
was very light—a little sprinting
and signal practice; and tomorrow
it will be lighter still. Then comes
the big battle with the men across
the bay, and the olive wreath will
rest with those who are the swiftest
and the strongest. That this will
be the Cardinal, there is every rea
son to believe.
The work of the graduate coaches
during the season has been of the
kind that brings results, and the
eleven men from Stanford will go
into the game playing as good and
as fast a game of ball as was ever
seen on the Coast. They have been
a willing team, the coaches say,
and now at a time when they must
play all the football they know, the
stamina and the sand andthespeed
will be there to win. This is the
conviction that has been growing
upon the wearers of the cardinal
all the season, and which has been
impressed particularly upon them
the last two nights of practice. The
men play well together, without
losing any chance for individual
gains; their defense is better now
than it has been at any other time
during the season; and it looks
mightily as though they have over
come the dangerous habit of fum
bling.
In addition to the cheering play
that has been put 114), the men are
all in the pink of condition, and
there isn't a stale man or a cripple
on the team. The fine work of
"Dad" Moulton, and later of A 1
Lean, is responsible for this—the first
time within three years that Stan
ford has gone into the big game in
better shape than it was at any
other period during the season.
The effort has been this year to
work the men up gradually to a cli
max on the big day, and it looks
now as though the climax will
come at that time. Training rules
have been kept faithfully by the
players, and all that the trainers
and coaches have advised has been
done.
The line-up of last night, when
the Varsity and the Second faced
each other for the last time, was
short and brisk and encouraging to
the bleachers, though there was no
yell leader there to get the rooters
to manifest their appreciation.
Only once was a yell given, and
then the yell leader disappeared
among the crowd and was seen 110
more. But the bleacherites were
pleased over the play, notwith
standing their silence, and after
the practice there were many
prophecies as to how large the score
would be.
The interference around the ends
was beautiful to look upon, it
made a semi-circle and placed Hill,
Smith, and Tarpey a number of
times beyond the reach of tacklers.
One disastrous fumble occurred
where it could do most damage—
within two yards of the Second's
goal line. But when the Second
tried to kick it out, there was a

Varsity man through ami on the
fullback, before the leather got any
start. In this way the damage
done by the fumble was repaired,
but the team realizes that the per
formance must not be repeated
with Berkeley. The Varsity's de
fense was first-class, and the Sec
ond was able to do but little —the
lines held too strong and the ends
were too vigilant. Lee and Hau
verman held down the two center
positions, and both of them played
such excellent ball that it is very
doubtful which will* enter the big
game Hrst, though both will doubt
less make their "S," having earned
it by hard, conscientious work.
Tarpey added to his reputation for
speed by making a fifteen-yard run
around the end; he has the prettiest
straight-arm on the field. Traeger
was not in the line-up, but occu
pied himself with making two beau
tiful placement kicks from the for
ty-yard line; it is not at all un
likely that Berkeley will again feel
the significance of the great man's
cleverness in this direction.
After the practice was over and
the men had heaved a sigli of re
lief, Coach Fickert walked across
the field smiling pleasantly. 'T
am satisfied with the condition of
the men and the ball that they are
playing," he said to a Palo Alto
man.
The conclusion is that we will
win.

than it has been at any other time
during the season; and it looks
mightily as though they have over
come the dangerous habit of fum
bling.
In addition to the cheering play
that has been put 114), the men are
all in the pink of condition, and
there isn't a stale man or a cripple
on the team. The fine work of
"Dad" Moulton, and later of A 1
Lean, is responsible for this—the first
time within three years that Stan
ford has gone into the big game in
better shape than it was at any
other period during the season.
The effort has been this year to
work the men up gradually to a cli
max on the big day, and it looks
now as though the climax will
come at that time. Training rules
have been kept faithfully by the
players, and all that the trainers
and coaches have advised has been
done.
The line-up of last night, when
the Varsity and the Second faced
each other for the last time, was
short and brisk and encouraging to
the bleachers, though there was no
yell leader there to get the rooters
to manifest their appreciation.
Only once was a yell given, and
then the yell leader disappeared
among the crowd and was seen 110
more. But the bleacherites were
pleased over the play, notwith
standing their silence, and after
the practice there were many
prophecies as to how large the score
would be.
The interference around the ends
was beautiful to look upon, it
made a semi-circle and placed Hill,
Smith, and Tarpey a number of
times beyond the reach of tacklers.
One disastrous fumble occurred
where it could do most damage—
within two yards of the Second's
goal line. But when the Second
tried to kick it out, there was a

Varsity man through ami on the
fullback, before the leather got any
start. In this way the damage
done by the fumble was repaired,
but the team realizes that the per
formance must not be repeated
with Berkeley. The Varsity's de
fense was first-class, and the Sec
ond was able to do but little —the
lines held too strong and the ends
were too vigilant. Lee and Hau
verman held down the two center
positions, and both of them played
such excellent ball that it is very
doubtful which will* enter the big
game Hrst, though both will doubt
less make their "S," having earned
it by hard, conscientious work.
Tarpey added to his reputation for
speed by making a fifteen-yard run
around the end; he has the prettiest
straight-arm on the field. Traeger
was not in the line-up, but occu
pied himself with making two beau
tiful placement kicks from the for
ty-yard line; it is not at all un
likely that Berkeley will again feel
the significance of the great man's
cleverness in this direction.
After the practice was over and
the men had heaved a sigli of re
lief, Coach Fickert walked across
the field smiling pleasantly. 'T
am satisfied with the condition of
the men and the ball that they are
playing," he said to a Palo Alto
man.
The conclusion is that we will
win.
