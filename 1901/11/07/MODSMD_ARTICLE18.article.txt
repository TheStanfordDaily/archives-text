Mr. Soule, who is in charge of the
Manual Training department, gave
a lecture to his students last Friday
in which he told them about the life
and work of the foundersof this Uni
versity and events in its history.
Mr. Soule has had intimate con
nections with the Stanford family
for more than forty years and
knows probably more about them
than any one else connected with
the University. A few extracts
from his address and summaries
of some of the parts follow:
Leland Stanford was born in
Watervliet, New York, March 9,
1824. He was the fourth of seven
brothers and was brought up as a
farmer. Ever since 1829 the Stan
fords have been interested in rail
roads. One of them commenced
the first iron road built in the
United States. Another, a son of
that pioneer, drove with his own
hand forty years later, the last
spike of the first transcontinental
railroad. Leland, when eighteen
years of age, made two or three
thousand dollars by clearing of
timber a tract of land along the
Mohawk and Hudson River Rail
road and selling the wood for ties.
He took this money and in three
years at Albany he spent all his
earnings, but he was a lawyer.
After a few years of law practice,
he married Jane L. Lathrop in
1850. For the forty-three years
that remained to him his wife was
his best counsellor and firmest
friend. In 1852 his law office in
Port Washington was burned and
he came to California to go
into business with his brothers.
In 1860 he was a delegate to the
National Convention which nom
inated Lincoln. During the cam
paign he was a worker for Lincoln
and one of his trusted friends.
While in the East he was nomi
nated for Governor of California,
Mr. Soule being a delegate to the
convention. As Governor of Cali
fornia, Mr. Stanford aided very
much in keeping the state quiet
during the Civil War, and he was
aided by a large Russian fleet of
nineteen warships. In 1861 he
was president of the famous com
pany which built the Central Pa
cific Railway. He realized earlier
than most men how infinitely
greater was California's prospective
wealth from the fruits of her soil
than from her mines of gold and
silver. It was in accordance with
this that he bought his large-farms.
He thought a great deal of forestry
and horses and therefore he planted
what is now the arboretum and
started the stock-farm. On May
14, 1868, in Sacramento, was born
Leland Stanford, Junior. After a
short life, in which he manifested
his various likings and genius in
mechanical things, he died of ma
laria contracted in Rome, on the
13th of March, 1884. At his
father's request to know what he
should do with his fortune, almost
the son's dying words were, "Dear
father, you can help your fellow
men, â€”help the boys and girls."
The rest of Mr. Soule's address
dealt with the foundation of this
University and events since then
with which most of us are so
familiar. In speaking of the great
affliction which came upon the
father and mother in a strange
land and among strange people, he
said significantly, "Sometime these
dispensations of Divine Providence
seem hard, but perhaps this one
was for a wise purpose"; and he

closed by saying, "We would sug
gest to each of you, young men and
young women, to bear in mind the
sacred admonition of the wise
King, 'Remember thy creator in
the days of thy youth.' "
