# Memorial for Barbara Jordan.
## 
### 
A memorial tablet, bearing the
inscription, "To the study of orni
thology this room is dedicated in
tender memory of Barbara Jordan,
who knew and loved the birds," has
arrived at the University and will
be placed in one of 'the new build
ings. The smaller panel contain
ing this inscription is within the
tablet â€”a horizontal panel, in size
about thirteen by nineteen inches.
The outer panel is decorated by a
large pine bough, among the tufts
and twigs of which are to be dis
covered several birds. On the
smaller tablet, the spaces not
covered by letters are occupied by
a mother quail leading her litttle
ones.
The work was designed by Pro
fessor Boltorv Coit Brown. It was
sent to Japan and very per
fectly chiseled in bronze by a
Japanese artist. The tablet is a
most admirable production of art,
beautiful in design, in its sympa
thetic delineation of the swaying
pine brand, in its drawing and
placing of the letters of the inscrip
tion, and in the perfection and
sympathy with which the Japan
artist has carried out the composi
tion.
