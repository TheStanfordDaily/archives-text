# FOOTBALL RALLY.
## Plenty of Enthusiasm at the Final Send-Off to the Football Men. 
### 
Last night the student body met
in the Assembly Hall for a final
rally and a send-off to the football
team.
It was a Quaker prayer-meeting
in one respect, for a strict balance
of sexes was maintained between
balcony and lower floor, but in
every other sense the rules of
Quaker service were disregarded.
The spirit moved everybody, all
the time â€” the Stanford spirit.
Eleven men are going to fight in
that spirit on Saturday, and their
supporters have only the vocal
means of showing their interest.
For downright enthusiasm the rally
was certainly the equal of any
which has been held in past years.
It was not in support of a failing
cause, and it was not based 011 a
certainty of winning. There is
just the right amount of doubt
about this year's contest and
enough assurance in the outcome
to make the meeting what it was.
When the building was full, and
half a dozen aspiring benedicts
had been called down from the bal
cony by call-downs from the floor,
the band struck up "Rah, Rah,
llali," then "Rush the Ball Along,"
and the prize song. "Just Because
They Hit That Line So Hard."
The first talk was by President
Jordan, who, in his usual good
natured style, prepared the team
for defeat and then told them de
feat could not come.
"A team prepared for victory can
always take defeat like men. I
shall be glad to be with you on
Saturday, for I have missed only
one game of the entire number.
That was because I was three
thousand five hundred miles
away, but even then I bad fre
quent telegrams to tell me how the
contest was going.
'"I believe in football, because it
teaches loyalty and the best way
of developing nerve. The whole
tone of the colleges of the United
States has been raised since foot
ball came into vogue."
Professor B. E. Howard was the
second speaker. It would have
been odd to omit this man from
the list after his speech made a
year ago, but in the future it will
seem impossible to get along with
out him or his equivalent. His
remarks of last night were of an
entirely different nature from the
jesting which the crowd may have
expected. They were earnest words
which carried a message to every
Stanford man:
"I come from one athletic gen
eration to another," he said, "to
bid you Godspeed and to do your
best in the name of true, clean
athletics. You go forth from a
University of great ideals. Stan
ford has stood firm in the face of
opposition that would have daunted
any other university in the world,
I believe. That is the spirit you
are to exemplify. We expect you
to win, and we have not the slight
est doubt but that you will win.
But do not come back to us with a
stain on our colors. An unclean
victory is the worst possible defeat.

If yon pltiy clean football we are
with you. It isn't winning the
game, but being men that counts."
The coaches and the players re
sponded to demands from the
house.
Mr. Fickert declared that the
Stanford team does not know when
to quit, that it will play to the last
minute, and that it will turn the
tables even though its opponents
may score at the start.
Mr. Spalding responded, prais
ing the spirit of the men. Mr.
Lewers, Mr. Searles, and ex-Cap
tain Burnett gave their reasons for
believing that Saturday would see
a Cardinal victory by a convincing
score.
With more songs and yeils, the
rally was ended.
