"Dad" Moulton, when asked re
garding the physical condition of
the football men had the following
to say:
"I consider the team to he in as
good condition as any J have ever
had anything to do with. There is
not a man on it who needs to go
into the game wearing bandages.
The men deserve credit for the con
sistent training which they have
done. 1 believe that they have
lived up to the rules as nearly as is
possible, and if I am rightly in
formed, better than Stanford teams
have done in the past. The re
sults have been good. The players
are a fine lot of fellows, gentle
manly and free from the petty
jealousies which so often spoil a
team. It has been a pleasure to
deal with them. They are what I
call perfectly game. They will
fight to the finish. lam especially
pleased with the coaches; they are
all hard working, conscientious
men.
" Science of conditioning holds
that a man should work harder
after the first ten minutes than be
fore they wear off the edge and get
a second wind for the rest of the
game. The team is in this condi
tion and, barring accidents, every
man will play harder and better in
the second half than in the first.
I can't see why we have'nt more
than a fighting chance. The men
have it in them to win, and they
are in the condition to win, and,
moreover, 1 expect them to win."
"Al" Lean, the Olympic Club
trainer, expressed himself as fol
lows:
"The men are in as good condi
tion as a team can be. They are
in as good condition as I have ever
seen a team. The boys are right
on edge, are feeling fine, and have
no complaints of any kind. They
will go into the game practically
without a bandage on them.
" There is no danger of over
training, for the hard work is
done. They are not over-confi
dent ; they realize that they will
have to work hard, and they are in
a condition to do it. The man
agement has done the right thing.
We have had everything we want
ed, —bandages, liniments, every
thing. The coaches and trainers
have done their duty and it is up
to the men to win."
