Although some upper-classmen
are disposed to underrate all at
tempts at jollification as compared
to what they experienced in their
first year, and refer to the crowded
and spirited gatherings in the little
chapel a few years ago as the ideal
type of a football rally, last night's
meeting in the Assembly Hall was
up to the standard. The most im
pressive feature was the hopeful
tone shown in all the speeches.
Devoid of over-confidence, recogniz
ing that a hard fight is in store for
the team, everyone expressed the
feeling that we ought to win. If
determination of players and en
thusiastic support of student body
presage anything, Saturday will be
a great day for Stanford.
