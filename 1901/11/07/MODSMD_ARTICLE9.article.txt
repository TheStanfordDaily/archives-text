Eleven players in the finest con
dition possible, and not a bruise nor
a bandage to tell the story of over
two months' strenuous football!
Such is the way our men are going
into the game, thanks to the intel
ligent and untiring efforts of Train
ers Moulton and Lean. It is a rec
ord these men and the University
may well be proud of. Whatever
be the outcome of this crucial con
test, the faithfulness of the trainers
is deserving of recognition far
greater than can be expressed in
terms of monthly salary.
