ration for the battle tomorrow.
Coaches and trainers have fin
ished their work, the men are se
lected who will play. The game
will be the first one between the
two universities in which the teams
received their instruction from
graduate coaches. Stanford sends
forth an eleven which judges pro
nounce the best balanced aggrega
tion ever developed here. The men
excel in the positions they play;
their physical condition cannot be
improved. \\ iih deteiminution to
make ilie fight of their lives, they
are serenely awaiting the game
which they kimw will lie one of the
hardest ever played on the Pacific
Coast, for the University of Cali
fornia will enter the very best team
it can choose from its more than
two thousand students. With con
fidence in the players and in the
issue of the contest, the supporters
of the Cardinal are counting the
hours until the whistle blows for
the kick-off at 2:30 o'clock tomor

Folsom streets grounds, San Fran
cisco.

of the game. The weights for the
California players are from a table
published some time ago and may
not be altogether reliable; those for
the Stanford men were taken yes

pounds, for the Cardinal of 1890,

pounds to the man for our oppo
nents and 171 9-11 for us, a differ
