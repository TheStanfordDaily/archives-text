# Rooters, Attention!
## 
### 
The men are to meet in the
rotunda of the Palace Hotel at 11
a.m. for band concert and general
"jolly up." We want every man to
leave town at 1 o'clock, so as to be
at the grounds not later than 1:80;
and it is very important for each
one to have his song-book with
him. There are several new yells
to be practiced before the game,
hence the importance of being on
time. Let each man have a liberal
amount of red ribbon on him, and
after the game join in the march
through town.
Chester Nahamokk,
Yell Leader.
