# Concert November 22d.
## 
### 
There is a strong probability that
Fran Schumann-Heinsch and Herr
liispham, two of the greatest sing
ers of the Grand Opera Company
of Maurice Grau, now at San Fran
cisco, will appear Friday, Novem
ber '22(1, at Stanford. Dr. Goebel
has succeeded, through bis friend,
Walter Damrosch, in obtaining the
promise of a concert by these ar
tists, provided a sufficiently large
bouse can be guaranteed. Since
the concert will be a treat such as
the University never before has had
it is hoped that faculty and stu
dents will give their support to
the undertaking.
