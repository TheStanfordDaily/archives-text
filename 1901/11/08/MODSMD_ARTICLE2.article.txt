# Fickert Fully Satisfied.

### 
When interviewed, Coach Fick
ert leaned back in his chair and
said: "Yes, I'll talk about the
game. I don't believe in all this
mysterious business, anyhow. You
may say that 1 consider the work
done during this season to have
been very good, on the whole. The
season has been a bad one for the
men, both in its shortness and in
the warm weather we have had.
Hut the fellows have played hard,
and their spirit has been good.
We've been very well supported by
the second team, and 1 want to
thank them for staying with the
game the way they did, even when
they knew they had no chance. I
think the game wili be one of the
most interesting and hard-fought
we have seen here on the Coast. It
will be a, whole lot better game
than last year's. 1 think it will be
full of possibilities and brilliant
plays. Both sides will use their
punters a whole lot, Overall for
Berkeley and Hill for us. Open
plays will be preferred over the
old, close formation. 1 expect a
pretty small score,but 1 think we'll
beat them. The physical condition
of the men is all that any one
would want. No. 1 don't* think
they'll run our ends so very much.
Maybe they'll try it, though."
Spalding- Talks of 18 to 0.
Coach Spalding spoke as follows
of the team:
''1 think we have a winning
team. I expect the game tomorrow
to be one of the most exciting we
have ever had. It will be full of
sensational plays on both sides. 1
am afraid that Berkeley may score
in the first few minutes of play.
Several of our men are new in
their positions, and as it will be
their first line-up in a big gamej
they may be more or less nervous
on that account. If we score first
I think the score will be a large
one and strictly one-sided and in
Stanford's favor.
"1 do not believe that there is a
team in the country that is better
balanced than the team that will
represent Stanford on Saturday.
1 1 expect to see Raitt add to his
brilliant reputation as a player
and look for him to use good gen
eralship in running the team.
Every man has earned his place on
the team by hard, conscientious
work, and any one of the eleven is
liable to develop into a star. 1
think that the playing of some of
the men will be of the kind that
will be talked over in the future
in the' telling of football stories.
It will be left to the men them

selves to determine who shall be
the heroes of these stories. 1 think
the score will be either 18 to 0, or
18 to 5 or 6."
McMillan Not Confident.
Coach McMillan spoke today on
the outlook as follows: "1 don't
feel nearly as confident as 1 did
two weeks ago. Not because our
team has gone back any, but
because Berkeley's improvement in
that time has been wonderful. Our
plays, 1 think, will be effective,
and we will be able to gain, but the
team fumbles so dreadfully that
we are liable to lose the game on
the very point of scoring. Then
again, Berkeley's play is always
dangerous, and there is no telling
when a man may get away for a
long run to a touchdown. To win
our team must play ball from the
start —play ball all the time. That
is what California will do. Our
team will make a good showing,
but 1 am not nearly as confident of
winning as some of the others here
are. The Berkeley backs are light,
but they are hard fighters, and
tbev die hard when they have got
the ball. If Stanford wins, the
men have got to get together on
every play, and play bal' all the
time. 1 expect to see a good game,
and as exciting as was ever played
on the Coast, but I don't think that
this is the best team that Stanford
has ever turned out, as some have
asserted."
Captain Fisher Determined.
Captain Fisher, when interviewed
this afternoon, said:
"We have the (inest team Stan
ford has ever sei t out, that 1 have
ever seen. The men are all experi
enced, and all hut three, — Barn
hisel, Thompson, and Clark — have
gone into an intercollegiate game
before. And these three men have
had considerable experience on
class teams or the second team of
last year, which played such good
ball. The men are not over-confi
dent, but though they realize that
they must play a good hard team,
they expect to win. There is not a
man on this team with the excep
tion of Slaker who cannot he re
placed without greatly injuring the
team.
"The Second has been especially
willing and 1 want to thank those
who have come out time after time
without getting in a line-up. 1 also
, wish to thank the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity for the thoughtfulness
and accommodation they have
shown us. They have allowed us
to have the training-table at their
house and they have run a first
class table. Fvery wish has been
granted.
"We will go into the game tomor
row with the intention of playing a.
good, hard, clean game, and whether
we win or lose we will do all there
is in us."
Searles Doubtful.
Professor Searles said it was
difficult for him to predict, not
knowing the other side very well.
He expects we will win, and this
opinion is bused on the line-play
ing qualities of the team and its
good condition. The most disturb
ing element is the tendency to fum
ble, but this has been largely over
come in this week's work. Over

confidence as well as fumbling is
fatal, and we can only win if we
"play hall."
Lewprs—lndications Favorable.
Professor Lewers, when inter
viewed about the game tomorrow,
said: "I do not wish to make any
predictions about the score, simply
because unforeseen circumstances
may arise, and there is always a
certain element of chance in every
football game. But 1 believe that
the team will win that can take
advantage of those chances, and
seize the opportunities when they
come. If the Stanford team plays
the game we al 1 expect them to play,
we may hope to win. On the
whole, indications favor us, though
we are not going up against an
easy team. Berkeley's ends play
fast and tackle well, and we shall
have to look out for them. Their
backs also will play a strong, reli
able game, and Overall punts well
and is a good, all-round man.
We are not as strong in our line as
some previous Stanford teams, and
California may take advantage of
some of these weak points, hut in
general we are stronger on the de
fensive than they are. Our backs
are heavier and quite as fast. We
have no reason to feel over-confi
dent about the result, for our op
ponents are not quitters in any
sense of the word. If we gain vic
tory, il will be because we earn it
by harder and better play. Ido
not think a rainy day will neces
sarily work to the advantage of the
he;i vier team."
