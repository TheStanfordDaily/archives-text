# Captain Fisher, Right Half.
## 
### 
Captain Ralph S. Fisher, light
halfback, played his first football
in the interclas√ü game between '02
ami '03, when he was a sophomore,
lie made the Varsity that season,
going into the 1900 game as half
hack. Last year he had his collar
bone broken in the game with the
alumni, three weeks before Thanks
giving, and could not play against
Berkeley. He now wears a specially
constructed harness to protect his
shoulder. He is a hard player,
and as captain of the team this
year has been most careful and en
thusiastic in his efforts to promote
the success of the season. During
the trouble between the faculty and
Treasurer Nourse, when it looked
as though our athletics might be
stopped for a time, he accepted the
responsibility of conducting affairs
so as to satisfy the demand of the
faculty, thus adding greatly to the
anxiety of his position.
Captain Fisher entered Stanford
in the fall of 1898, the season when
his brother, Forrest Fisher, who
had played a phenomenal game at
half in the 28 to 0 victory the year
before, was carried from the field
on Thanksgiving day, the captain
of the first defeated Stanford team,
it is Ralph Fisher's burning am
bition to captain%i Cardinal eleven
that will administer an overwhelm
ing defeat to the Blue and Gold,
which three years ago won its
initial victory over his brother.
Fisher prepared for Stanford at
the University of Oregon. He reg
isters from The Dalles, Oregon, and
is a physiology major. He is 21
years old, weighs 161 pounds, and
is 5:11 tall.
