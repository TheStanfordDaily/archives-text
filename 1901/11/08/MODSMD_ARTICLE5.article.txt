Tomorrow Stanford will play
the game of the year, for which she
lias spent two months of hard
training and practice. Her oppo
nent has had the same advantages
and opportunities. Neither team
has been handicapped. Both are
in the best possible condition. It
is only a question of which side has
made the most of its material. The
best team will win, and we hope
that we have that team.
