# CALIFORNIA WON THE GAME.
## In a Drizzling Rain Berkeley Defeats Stanford by a Score of 2 to 0.— Great Crowd Watched the Contest. 
### 
It was only on a "fluke" that
Berkeley scored Saturday, but that
inadequately tells the story of the
gamest struggle against pressing
odds, and of the finest fight from
start to finish that Pacific Coast
football has seen. And now that
the battle is fought, and the up
holders of the Cardinal are wonder
ing and asking each other how
such an end came to their rising
hopes, one picture is impressed on
the memory of every man who wit
nessed the game, which carries in
itself a weight of explanation. The
picture is of quarter-back Raitt,
standing in the back field, unsup
ported by his fellows, catching the
slippery ball with unerring accur
acy, and starting 011 a lone run
toward the swooping rush of Cal
ifornia tacklers, only to be downed
in his tracks, scarcely a yard to
the good. To enable his men to
get over the slushy field, Overall
kicked high in the air, and the ab
solute lack of interference on the
part of the. Cardinal players did
the rest. Captain Womble and
Hudson might as well have been
running on an open prairie so far
as systematic resistance to their
rushes is concerned. California's
interference, on the other hand,
was superb, and to that, as much
as to the heavy field, does she owe
the victory. Whether running-in
punts or dashing around the op
posing ends, there was invariably
a moving wall of players, shifty
and strong, repelling the attacks
on the runner. Such protection
our team had no conception of; it
was born of weeks of patient drill
by men who knew that in team
work lay their only hope not only
of winning but of staving off a
crushing defeat.
It was not energy, enthusiasm,
determination, and ability that
Stanford lacked. The eleven fought
from first to last with the despera
tion of men who would cut through
swarming ranks to liberty. But
the Californians' weapons were
keen-edged, and theirs was the art
of handling them, —there lies the
whole secret of the defeat.
The actual score of the game was
2 to 0. The "safety" that resulted
from Raitt's clutching the leather
back of his goal-line after Hill's
punt from near the fifteen-yard line
had been blocked by right guard
Overall, was made before the game
was tifteen minutes old, but it
scored the winning points. Tech
nically, the points came from a
"fluke," but breaking through and
blocking kicks is a part of
good football, and the credit due to
Overall cannot be questioned. If
further excuse for the result be
looked for, two factors present
themselves : The first is the lack
of interference both in line and
back-field plays that characterized
the Stanford team; the second is
the nature of the gridiron, which,
all contrary statements notwith
standing, was ruinous to the suc

cess of the heavy Cardinal backs
and the style of play that had been
adopted. Ankle-deep in mud and
sand, the weighty ball-carriers
stuck fast and floundered where the
lighter Berkeleyans gamboled as if
on greensward. Slaker, the fastest
man to start with the ball the Coast
has seen, was constantly hampered
by the sticky surface beneath him,
and the heavier players all affirm
that they were handicapped far
more than their-cornpanions.
Stanford's team to a man fulfilled
their antebellum promise of play
ing "the best they knew how." In
tense eagerness to do his part and
more characterized every wearer of
the "S." But invariably natural
ability brings a few men to the
front whose showing has more of
the spectacular than that of his
neighbor, who, perhaps, strives as
earnestly. This time it was Sla
ker, Raitt, Traeger, and Fisher who
were most in evidence. Slaker fought
to the last whistle-call with all the
dash and skill that won him fame
at Chicago. When he found that
hy some strange coincidence a
quartet of California players
blocked his path the instant his
signal was given, he took to hurd
ling the line, and both here and in
hacking up his team on the defense,
he made a record in his last college
game that will long stand as a
model. Traeger was easily the best,
tackle on the field and only mis
sed a field goal at forty-three yards
because of the sogginess of the ball.
Raitt, in spite of his lack of aid,
worked like a Trojan, while Fisher
went hard and desperately into
every play.
It has been estimated that four
teen thousand people saw the con
test, although the exact figures
will be unknown until tomorrow.
This is about two thousand less
than last season's total. The first
rain in weeks had chosen the day
of the annual football match for its
debut. From a misty drizzle it
developed into a genuine drencher
before the game was ended. Six
hundred rooters had seats in the
Stanford section, while Berkeley's
force was two hundred better than
that. California's blue and yellow
hats and gaudy banners produced
the usual effects, and her souks
and yells were given with a pre
cision and volume that told no
tales of neglect. To the north, the
sloping rows of seats blossomed out
in a mass of cardinal with hats of
the brightest of scarlet and an in
novation in the way of rooting par
aphernalia in the shape of blood
red megaphones that swayed in
time with the music of the rea
coated band, and when putin use,
swelled the chorus-sound until it
equalled that of many thousand
voices. It was quite annoying that
the band, instead of being in the
center of the Stanford sections, as
usual, was perched in a corner,
and so far from the rooters that
following the music was practically

an impossibility. The crowd
cheered manfully for the team un
til the last hopeless moment had
come and the victors were dancing
their serpentine around the grid
iron and down Market street.

of winning but of staving off a

It was not energy, enthusiasm,

the Californians' weapons were

whole secret of the defeat.

further excuse for the result be

themselves : The first is the lack

the Stanford team; the second is
the nature of the gridiron, which,
all contrary statements notwith
standing, was ruinous to the suc

cess of the heavy Cardinal backs
and the style of play that had been
adopted. Ankle-deep in mud and
sand, the weighty ball-carriers
stuck fast and floundered where the
lighter Berkeleyans gamboled as if
on greensward. Slaker, the fastest
man to start with the ball the Coast
has seen, was constantly hampered
by the sticky surface beneath him,

more than their-cornpanions.
Stanford's team to a man fulfilled
their antebellum promise of play
ing "the best they knew how." In
tense eagerness to do his part and
more characterized every wearer of
the "S." But invariably natural
ability brings a few men to the
front whose showing has more of
the spectacular than that of his
neighbor, who, perhaps, strives as
earnestly. This time it was Sla
ker, Raitt, Traeger, and Fisher who
were most in evidence. Slaker fought
to the last whistle-call with all the
dash and skill that won him fame
at Chicago. When he found that
hy some strange coincidence a
quartet of California players
blocked his path the instant his
signal was given, he took to hurd
ling the line, and both here and in
hacking up his team on the defense,
he made a record in his last college
game that will long stand as a
model. Traeger was easily the best,
tackle on the field and only mis
sed a field goal at forty-three yards
because of the sogginess of the ball.
Raitt, in spite of his lack of aid,
worked like a Trojan, while Fisher
went hard and desperately into
every play.
It has been estimated that four
teen thousand people saw the con
test, although the exact figures
will be unknown until tomorrow.
This is about two thousand less
than last season's total. The first
rain in weeks had chosen the day
of the annual football match for its
debut. From a misty drizzle it
developed into a genuine drencher
before the game was ended. Six
hundred rooters had seats in the
Stanford section, while Berkeley's
force was two hundred better than
that. California's blue and yellow
hats and gaudy banners produced
the usual effects, and her souks
and yells were given with a pre
cision and volume that told no
tales of neglect. To the north, the
sloping rows of seats blossomed out
in a mass of cardinal with hats of
the brightest of scarlet and an in
novation in the way of rooting par
aphernalia in the shape of blood
red megaphones that swayed in
time with the music of the rea
coated band, and when putin use,
swelled the chorus-sound until it
equalled that of many thousand
voices. It was quite annoying that
the band, instead of being in the
center of the Stanford sections, as
usual, was perched in a corner,
and so far from the rooters that
following the music was practically

an impossibility. The crowd
cheered manfully for the team un
til the last hopeless moment had
come and the victors were dancing
their serpentine around the grid
iron and down Market street.
It was only on a "fluke" that
Berkeley scored Saturday, but that
inadequately tells the story of the
gamest struggle against pressing
odds, and of the finest fight from
start to finish that Pacific Coast
football has seen. And now that
the battle is fought, and the up
holders of the Cardinal are wonder
ing and asking each other how
such an end came to their rising
hopes, one picture is impressed on
the memory of every man who wit
nessed the game, which carries in
itself a weight of explanation. The
picture is of quarter-back Raitt,
standing in the back field, unsup
ported by his fellows, catching the
slippery ball with unerring accur
acy, and starting 011 a lone run
toward the swooping rush of Cal
ifornia tacklers, only to be downed
in his tracks, scarcely a yard to
the good. To enable his men to
get over the slushy field, Overall
kicked high in the air, and the ab
solute lack of interference on the
part of the. Cardinal players did
the rest. Captain Womble and
Hudson might as well have been
running on an open prairie so far
as systematic resistance to their
rushes is concerned. California's
interference, on the other hand,
was superb, and to that, as much
as to the heavy field, does she owe
the victory. Whether running-in
punts or dashing around the op
posing ends, there was invariably
a moving wall of players, shifty
and strong, repelling the attacks
on the runner. Such protection
our team had no conception of; it
was born of weeks of patient drill
by men who knew that in team
work lay their only hope not only
of winning but of staving off a
crushing defeat.
