To acknowledge defeat, to grant
an opponent superiority, to admit
a victory, these are the most diffi
cult parte of every contest, as all
loyal Stanford men and women
now realize. Nevertheless, we ac
cept al 1 with that spirit of loyalty
to our team and college which even
defeat cannot weaken. The sixteen
men who represented the Cardinal
in a losing game Saturday hold as
much respect and more considera
tion than if the circumstances were
otherwise. They played the game
that we had expected of them. Not
a man disappointed us. We are
just as grateful to them, and just
as proud as though they had been
crowned the victors. We are all
loyal to our colors. We believe in
them, and have faith in their abil
ity to conquer, even though the
evidence for a time is negative.
Everything Stanford is of more
value to us than anything else.
Our football heroes and their
coaches and trainers naturally feel
the disappointment of a defeat
more keenly than their supporters.
They have not worked hard, con
scientiously, and consistently for
two months to complacently suffer
defeat. As their one purpose, idea,
and thought has been to win, so
their great consolation should be
the knowledge of our entire con
fidence in them. To Ralph Fisher,
who so ably captained, and to
Charlie Kickert and his assistants,
who have so faithfully coached our
Varsity, and to every individual
man of that eleven which so honor
ably and faithfully defended our
goal in an up-hill fight, we extend,

in behalf of the whole student
body, a hearty handshake of praise
and sympathy, and assure them of
our thanks and gratitude for their
noble efforts.
