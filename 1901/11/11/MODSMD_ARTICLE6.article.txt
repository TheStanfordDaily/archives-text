President Wheeler of the Uni
versity of California makes the
suggestion that three football
games should be played between
the universities each season instead
of one. There would he many ad
vantages in pursuing this plan,
especially so long as we are de
prived of a variety of intercollegiate
games. It would tend to develop a
much better game on the Coast.
Walter Camp sounds the warning
that, isolated as we are from the
East and relying on graduate
coaches, football is liable to stand
still if not to experience a set-back
on the Coast. With only minor
practice contests before the one
contest of the year, we are unable
to develop, a highly perfected game
because we meet the result of the
most careful coaching and training
for only the one time. President
Wheeler's suggestion merits a thor
ough consideration.
