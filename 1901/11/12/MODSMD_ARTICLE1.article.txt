# HORAN ACCUSED.
## The 						"Evening Post" Calls the Ex-Lafayette Player a Traitor. 
### 
In Monday's issue of the San
Francisco Evening Post there was a
column article headed "Stanford is
sore over the defeat," with sub-head
"Berkeley's victory attributed to
bad weather and betrayal of sig
nals." The article accuses lloran
of giving the Berkeley men our
signals. The following is quoted:
"Stanford suffered also from the
intimate knowledge which Cali
fornia had of the signals used in
the Stanford pi ays. In this con
nection the Stanford people make a
charge which, if proven, should
forever bar from the game 011 this
Coast the person whom it chiefly
concerns. The one whom Stanford
accuses of having played the part
of traitor is "Jack" Horan, the
former Lafayette man, who was at
Stanford during the early part of
the season. The facte are these:
"lloran came to the Coast to
enter Berkeley. When he got to
the city there was considerable
rivalry between the two univer
sities to secure possession of him,
as it was thought that be was a
player of some ability. The per
suasive powers of the Stanford con
tingent proved superior to those of
the Berkeley folk, and it was an
nounced thiit lloran would attend
Stanford. He went there and en
tered the lists as a candidate for
the football eleven, participating
in a number of games for Stan
ford.
"As the season wore along the
coaches made up the list of secret
signals which were to be used in the
intercollegiate game. A slip con
taining the signals was given to
each player, and the very day after
they were given out lloran an
nounced that he found it impossi
ble to remain longer at the Univer
sity, and left. Several days later
he was at Berkeley assisting in the
coaching of the California eleven,
and he remained there up to Sat
urday.
"It is now charged by the Stan
ford people that lloran betrayed
the signals to the California eleven,
and the men who participated in
the game for Stanford on Saturday
assert that the signals given by
Raitt were understood by the
Berkeley players as thoroughly as
by the players on the Stanford
side. On the night before the game
a Stanford sympathizer in San
Francisco wired to Coach Fickert
that Berkeley knew all the Stan
ford signals. It was then too late
to make any changes, and the
Stanford men were forced to go into
the game knowing that every play
they attempted would be under
stood by their opponents.
"The students are very bitter
against Horan and threats have
been made that if he ever again
visits the campus it will go hard
with him. Some of those who lost
heavily on the game looked for
him about the cafes in San Fran
cisco Saturday night, vowing to be
even with him for playing the part
of traitor. He was not found, bow
ever, by any of the angry stu
dents."
