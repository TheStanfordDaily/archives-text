We are very much surprised at
the tone and attitude of our eon
temporary sheet across the bay
when it publishes such a hitter and
discourteous article as is quoted
in today's issue. We can hardly
believe that this accusation on the
part of the editor-in-chief of the
Califomian is expressive of the
true sentiment of the Berkeley stu
dent body. We have defined our
position and believe that it is up
held by the great majority of the
students. That position is simply
that we refuse to believe Berkeley
dishonorable without positive
proof in the affirmative.
Charlie Fickert is a man who
has always held the respect and
admiration of his fellow students.
All through his undergraduate
days he stood for honesty, straight
forwardness, and square dealing.
We have faith in his sincerity to
do what is right and honorable.
Never can we think him unsports
manlike and ungentlemanly. We
are not acquainted with all the
facts, and Charlie Fickert's charac
ter and strong personality are his
own defense. .
