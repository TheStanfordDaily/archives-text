Another opportunity to hear
some excellent musical talent is in
store for Stanford people. Every
one should take advantage of it,
and support Dr. Goebel, who has
been instrumental in securing the
artists, in his effort to make tiie
concert a success. A large guar
antee has been made and the co
operation of faculty and students
is needed. The concert will be ex
ceptionally good and everyone
should keep the 2'2d of this month
open for this musical treat.
