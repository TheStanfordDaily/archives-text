# ON LIFE AT STANFORD.
## Professor Fetter, at the Cornell University Freshman Receptin, Tells About Our Student Body. 
### 
Professor Frank A. Fetter, for
merly professor of Economies here
at Stanford, gave a talk at the
freshman reception at Cornell a
few days ago on student life in
Stanford. A summary of what he
said is given below.
''As one alights from the train
at Stanford University one is im
mediately struck hy the beauty
of the site selected for the upbuild
ing of this "Cornell of the West."
Looking down a long avenue of
palms and trees one sees the college
grounds. The buildings are of yel
low sandstone, erected in a large
quadrangle. They are impressive
in exterior appearances, yet the in
terior of the quadrangle is rich in
architectural grace and beauty and
affords a most beautiful spot for
student activities.
"Although founded by great
wealth and large endowments,
Stanford University does not edu
cate a wealthy class of students.
In fact a larger number of the stu
dents there are self-supporting than
at any other large university.
Throughout the institution a most
democratic spirit is evident, which
shows itself in a marked lack of
conventionality. At no large uni
versity are the social functions at
tended with less formality, and at
no other place do they begin and
close so early. The cosmopolitan
ism of the students gives rise to
a good-fellowship exceeded in no
other institution."
