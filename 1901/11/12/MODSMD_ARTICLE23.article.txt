Professor AlphonsoG. Newcomer,
in His "American Literature," just
issued by Scott, Foresmari and Com
pany of Chicago, makes use of a
sane and well balanced method that
will be appreciated by teachers of
English. He takes it for granted
that the old idea of teaching litera
ture from text-books alone is dead,
but on the other hand he insists
that the more modern method, that
of the reading and studying of se
lected- masterpieces, is also unsatis
factory in that it leaves the student
without any clear idea of the rela
tion of what he has read to other
literature and to history. The rem
edy is to be found in a compromise.
There must be liberal reading, but
this reading must be "regulated and
the acquired knowledge set in order
by the use of a critical history."
The "American Literature" car
ries out this idea. It gives an in
teresting and orderly account of the
history of letters in this country
from the crude colonial beginnings
to the complexities of the present
time. In doing so it keeps the liter
ary movements distinct and brings
into prominent relief a dozen or
more great names. Many minor
names are introduced, but the pro
proportion is preserved so that they
help bring out the perspective,
which is perhaps the leading fea
ture of the book. In the same way
the list of contemporary writers
goes to show that literature is not a
dead thing but is still a part of our
lives. Throughout, and especially
in the case of the great writers, the
student is encouraged to study for
himself and is given many sugges*
tions. With a book of this sort to
supplement the required reading
and study, the student will gain a
much clearer conception, not only
of the great, writers themselves, hut
of the place these writers, hold in
literaurte as a whole
The work shows the result of in

Especially is this true in the au
thor's sympathetic treatment of
"native" literature as opposed to
"academic." Without allowing his
personal opinions to bee >me at all
obtrusive, Professor Newcomer is so
original and suggestive that his
"American Literature" is some
thing more than a text-book.
