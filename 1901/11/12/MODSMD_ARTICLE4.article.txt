# FICKERT ACCUSED.
## Berkeley Editor Claims Our Head Coach is Unsportsmanlike. 
### 
The Daily Californian published
the following editorial this morning
criticising Charlie Fickert as head
coach of our Varsity:
"The unsportsmanlike and un
gentlemanly spirit which the head
coach of Stanford team has dis
played since the defeat of bis team
should, to say the least, leave a bad
taste in the Stanford mouth. Cali
fornia does not believe that Coach
Fickert represents the true spirit of
Stanford University. The attitude
of Captain Fisher is conclusive
proof that he does not represent the
spirit of the team. Stanford was
defeated at every point fairly and
squarely. To insinuate that the
victory was won by employ
ment of illegitimate methods
but reflects upon the per
son making such statements. Stan
ford was defeated, and as the de
feated party she occupies a peculiar
position. If the students of Stan
ford University care anything for
the athletic honor of their univer
sity and for their reputation as
sportsmen, they should make their
coach understand in an unmis
takable manner that they are thor
oughly out of sympathy with the
puerile spirit which he has thus
far displayed. The manifestation
of such a spirit will work greater
harm to Stanford among the lovers
of true sport than the loss of every
intercollegiate contest of the year.
We feel sure that Coach Fickert
does not represent the spirit of bis
University."
