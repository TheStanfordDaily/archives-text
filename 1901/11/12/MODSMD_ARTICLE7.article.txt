# "The Man from Mexico."
## 
### 
If we bad won the game there
would have been 110 performance at
the Grand Opera House. At least
if the racket and responses from the
audience had been much greater in
victory than they actually were in
defeat, Walter E. Perkins and his
company would have seen their
farce completely rough-housed.
The play was as successful from
the student body standpoint as a
rally of defeat could well be. The
house was tilled for the most part

with University men and women,
and a profit is assured to the
lessees.
. In the first intermission the Glee
Club gave a good short selection,
being encored; and after the second
act the Mandolin Club played
twice, nniking a decided hit.
The farce itself is a clean three
act story of the imprisonment of a
New York swell, who deceives his
family into the belief that he spent
the time in Mexico. Ordinary
farce expedients and love affairs
run witli the plot. Had we won
the game the good points of the
comedy might have been more ap
preciated.
