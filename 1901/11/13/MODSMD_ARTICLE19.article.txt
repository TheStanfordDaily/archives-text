# MONEY AT THE GAME.
## Receipts Will Approximate $19,000, Which is $6,000 Less Than Last Thanksgiving. 
### 
All that is yet known of the
finances of the big game of last
Saturday is that the receipts will
approximate $19,000. Treasurer
Edwards is working night and day
over the figures, and by tomorrow
morning his report will be com
pleted. Just what the expenses at
tached to the contest are cannot
now be approximated, because .the
bills have not come in. It is safe
to say, however, that the game will
not mean as much financially to
the student body treasury as it did
last year.
The total receipts for the Thanks
giving game of 1900 were $25,195,
an increase of $4,500 over the pre
ceding year. Of this $25,195, the
two universities netted $20,143.50,
or $10,171.75 apiece, there being a
mutual expense attached to the
game which amounted t055,051.50.
Stanford's net receipts from the
game totaled $10,321.75, which in
cluded $250 received from the pub
lication of the official souvenir pro
gram. This was $2,000 more than
in '99, and probably more even
than that amount in excess of this
year's receipts; though nothing
final will be known until the treas
urer's official report is issued.
