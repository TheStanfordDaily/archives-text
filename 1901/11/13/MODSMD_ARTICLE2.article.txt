Nearly ninety young women
were present at an interesting
meeting of the Y. W. C. A. yester
day, when Miss Stafford tjdd the
girls about a young princess from
India who was at the Lake
Geneva conference last summer,
the power of whose Christian life is
ft:lt by all who hear of her.
After a solo by Mrs. El'a B.
McDowell, the simple initiation
ceremony took place. About forty
new members sat by themselves in
the central aisle. The president,
Miss Wilbur, took the chair; the
names of the new members were
read, and they stood in a body,
joining with the president and the
members of the association in a re
sponsive service which bad been
arranged on printed slips. The
meeting closed with prayer.
The association has now one
hundred and thirty-five members.
Mis√ü Stafford's visit has resulted in
the organization of an advisory
committee of faculty ladies, which
has the following duties:
1. To co-operate with the finance
committee in providing a per
manent financial basis for the gen
eral secretaryship.
2. To extend the call and make
the business proposition to the gen
eral secretary, who has previously
been nominated and chosen by the
cabinet in consultation with the
advisory committee.
3. To co-operate with the cabinet
in its social and its extension work.
This committee is deemed ad
visable so as to give a continuity
and progression to the work of the
association, which is not possible
when this is administered solely by
undergraduate students of limited
experience and short terms of oflice.
The ladies on the committee are
Mrs. Murray, Mrs. O. M. Johnston,
Mrs. O. L. Elliott, Mrs. Matzke,
and Mrs. Gilbert.
