# English Club Meeting.
## 
### 
Mrs. Margaret Collier Graham
read a paper on the Heroine in
Modern Literature before the
English Club last evening. The
article proved to be a delightful
satire 011 the amount of space in
books, magazines, and newspapers
devoted to the young woman and
her foibles. Mrs. Graham cleverly
inverted the characteristic advice

given in columns of our periodicals
and newspapers by telling the
young men how to be agreeable
and attractive to women. She ac
counted for the complexity of a
girl's characteristics by the com
plexity of influences and environ
ment in her life, whereas a boy's
surroundings make him si in pie
and direct.
The meeting was held at the
Kappa Alpha Theta house. The
election of Miss Sobey and Miss
Higgins to the membership was
announced by the executive com
mittee.
