# CAMP BUILDINGS CONDEMNED.
## Space Needed for Driveway and New Buildings. Old Ones Unsanitary. 
### 
Architect Hodges announced to
day that orders have been issued
for all the buildings on the campus
in the region of the Camp to he re
moved. The change is thought to
he advisable for several reasons:
first, to make room for the exten
sion and grading of the street
which runs in front of the Hook
store; second, because the old
buildings, which were erected
fifteen years ago when the Univer
sity was building, have become un
sanitary and are out of harmony
with the architecture of their sur
roundings; and third, to make
room for new buildings.
On Monday, Mr. Coolidge, man
ager of the Camp, received the fol
lowing letter from Mr. liodges:
"I am instructed by the University
authorities to notify you that the
Camp buildings now rented by you
have been condemned and will be
pulled down after January 1,
1902."
Today Mrs. Stanford was seen
and asked if it would be possible
to postpone the removal of the
buildings until the end of the sec
ond semester. The ground for the
request was that the men had
figured their expenses for the year,
and it would be very difficult for
them to make the change. Mrs.
Stanford stated she wished to
utilize the space for building lots,
and would give no definite answer
until she had inspected the Camp.
As far as is known no provision
has been made as yet for similar
accommodations on the campus.
