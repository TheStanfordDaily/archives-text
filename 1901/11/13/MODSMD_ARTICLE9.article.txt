Several remarks and complaints
relative to the poor street lighting
on the campus and row have been
overheard by Palo Alto men
within the last few weeks. We feel
called upon to give this sentiment
expression in the paper, that it
may reach the responsible person,
who has been so solicitous in all
other improvements on the row,
being the one who superintended
the painting of the houses on the
campus. Members of the* faculty
have paid for having the electric
light poles placed on the row at a
personal expense, with the under
standing that the public thorough
fares would he kept lighted. Their
investment seems to have been a
poor one, as the contract is not car
ried out by the second party. Con
sequently the row has been without
adequate light, causing students to
cast reflections at the management;
and the faculty, who regret their
unsuccessful attempt to forward a
common good, to strongly sym
pathize with this adverse senti
ment.
