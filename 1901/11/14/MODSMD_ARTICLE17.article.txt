Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Ah ;i member of this community,
hut hk one unable often to attend
lectures, concerts, etc., in San
Francisco, I would like to express
my gratitude to the Music Com
mittee for it√ü energy and enter
prise in bringing to Stanford so
much that is delightful in art and
music, and hope that a full As
sembly Mall one week from Friday
evening will testify to the appre
ciation of many for the untiring
efforts of a few. Faculty Lady.
