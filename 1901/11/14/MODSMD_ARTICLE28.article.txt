# The

"The Camp buildings have be
come unsanitary," says last night's
Palo Alto, The statement calls
up visions of human misery, pesti
lence, and death. I realize the
futility of attempting to alter these
ready-made conceptions, especially
so long as the truth of them, if
indeed their truth is ever ques
tioned, is tested only by such data
as can be obtained from cursory
glances at the outside of the build
ings. There have been changes at
the Camp in the last two years, but
the traditions have not changed â€”
probably they never will.
Nevertheless 1 submit a few facts.
To begin with, the Camp is prop
erly drained and has been so for
over a year. In the last two years
over three hundred dollars has
been expended in papering and
renovating the Camp. Most of
the men who live in the Camp
have stoves; those who do not, have
access to the stove in the reading
room. In the last two years there
have been three serious illnesses.
One man had appendicitis, another
the measles, a third the malaria.
Dr. Wilbur, who attended the last
mentioned patient, stated that he
contracted the desease before com
ing to the University. There have
been minor illnesses, but with the
exception of the three men just re
ferred to, no one has been obliged
to leave the Camp or to drop Uni
versity work on account of bad
health. I hear that there are men
in Encina who have had their
sicknesses; even among the inhabi
tants of the shingle palaces on the
Row, 1 am told, there are those
who are not exempt from ills of the
llesh. There are a number of valid
reasons for the removal of the
Camp; why not limit the discussion
to them? 11. F. Coolidok.
