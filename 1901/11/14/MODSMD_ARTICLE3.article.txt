# HOPPER ON SIGNALS.
## California Coach Pledges His Word On the Honor of the Blue and Gold. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
DkauSik: I beg you to ex tend to '
me, as assistant coach of the Uni
versity of California, the courtesy of
your columns.
On last Saturday, our two uni
versities met upon the gridiron in
a fair, square, and honorable strug
gle. Victory has often perched
upon your banners; this time she
has flitted to ours. We take pride
in the fact, because to defeat men
such as represent Stanford Univer
sity is a fact to give pride. We
knew that we had defeated- gritty,
courageous, and chivalrous oppon
ents.
Victory, as 1 said, has often been
yours; at such times, 1 think, we
took defeat —a bitter pill—without
a grimace. We knew we had been
defeated squarely, honorably, by
superior skill and brawn. And this
time, when defeat became your lot,
1 doubt not that your team and
your University took it gamely and
squarely, as we had of yore.
Only —such unfortunate things
happen at such times —it seems
that in the momentary chagrin
and bitterness of defeat, some of
Stanford's men let slip an insinua
tion unworthy of them in their
better moments. And unhappily,
this unpondered statement has
been passed from mouth to mouth
and taken up by the press till it
has grown into a tangible accusa
tion and bids fair to become" a
legend as stubborn and tenacious
as it is untrue.
In short, the California team has
been accused of having obtained
possession of the Stanford signals,
and of having used this knowledge
to defeat the Stanford team.
Although 1 have now seen this
charge over Coach Fickert's name
in three different San Francisco
papers, I do not believe he formu
lated it. 1 refuse to believe that
he did. 1 know Charles Fickert;
I have often seen him fight for his
college; 1 have fought against him.
1 know him as too sturdy and
honorable an opponent to ever con
ceive the thoughts that have been
accredited to him.
Rut to put a stop to the deplor
able story, 1 wish to give my word
of honor, and pledge the honor of
CoachSiinpson and Captain Womble
and the entire California team to
this fact: The California football
team went, into the game and played
the game without the knowledge of
the Stanford signals.
And I wish further to say that if
that knowledge had been offered to
us, we would have spurned it; that
if it had been forced upon us we
would have apprised the Stanford
team of the fact; and that, had any
traitor to the Stanford cause
offered us the signals, he would
have been iguomiuiously driven
away from our campus.
1 am not acquainted with Mr.
Horan. 1 have not a tremendous
respect for him; he is too llippy
floppy an individual. Rut 1 must
say that the men who accuse him
of giving away the Stanford signals
do him a stinging injustice. Horan

was on our campus during the last
few days of our training. He was
there purely as a newspaper man,
and did positively no coaching.
If he had tried to do so, he would
have been promptly rebuked. In
fact we looked upon him with some
distrust, and always excluded him
from our more intimate practice,
lie was never asked the slightest
question as to the Stanford style of
play and he had the tact never to
volunteer any information.
Mr. Editor, I have been inti
mately connected with the football
men of my college for many years.
In my measure, 1 have fought for
my college as hard as any of you
have fought for the Cardinal. I
know the California man thor
oughly, I know his spirit; and I
can tell you that when the men of
Stanford accuse us of seeking vic
tory by dirty, mean, petty means,
they show that they do not know
us. That was not the spirit of the
team that went forth to battle with
yours on last Saturday. Do not
belittle that team. It' was moved
by an ardent spirit that could have
moved mountains. It was a team
that deserved the homage of frieml
and foe. Honor that team, men of
Stanford; honor it in victory as we
honor you in defeat. And may
never a few malicious tongues,
wagged at the .bidding of stunted
minds, destroy that feeling of re
spect that we of California hold
toward your Cardinal fighters, that
you of Stanford hold, I firmly be
lieve, toward the champions of the
lilue and Gold.

can tell you that when the men of
Stanford accuse us of seeking vic
tory by dirty, mean, petty means,
they show that they do not know
us. That was not the spirit of the
team that went forth to battle with
yours on last Saturday. Do not
belittle that team. It' was moved
by an ardent spirit that could have
moved mountains. It was a team
that deserved the homage of frieml
and foe. Honor that team, men of
Stanford; honor it in victory as we
honor you in defeat. And may
never a few malicious tongues,
wagged at the .bidding of stunted
minds, destroy that feeling of re
spect that we of California hold
toward your Cardinal fighters, that
you of Stanford hold, I firmly be
lieve, toward the champions of the
lilue and Gold.
Jamks Hoppkr,
Assistant Coach
University of California.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
DkauSik: I beg you to ex tend to '
me, as assistant coach of the Uni
versity of California, the courtesy of
your columns.
On last Saturday, our two uni
versities met upon the gridiron in
a fair, square, and honorable strug
gle. Victory has often perched
upon your banners; this time she
has flitted to ours. We take pride
in the fact, because to defeat men
such as represent Stanford Univer
sity is a fact to give pride. We
knew that we had defeated- gritty,
courageous, and chivalrous oppon
ents.
Victory, as 1 said, has often been
yours; at such times, 1 think, we
took defeat —a bitter pill—without
a grimace. We knew we had been
defeated squarely, honorably, by
superior skill and brawn. And this
time, when defeat became your lot,
1 doubt not that your team and
your University took it gamely and
squarely, as we had of yore.
Only —such unfortunate things
happen at such times —it seems
that in the momentary chagrin
and bitterness of defeat, some of
Stanford's men let slip an insinua
tion unworthy of them in their
better moments. And unhappily,
this unpondered statement has
been passed from mouth to mouth
and taken up by the press till it
has grown into a tangible accusa
tion and bids fair to become" a
legend as stubborn and tenacious
as it is untrue.
In short, the California team has
been accused of having obtained
possession of the Stanford signals,
and of having used this knowledge
to defeat the Stanford team.
Although 1 have now seen this
charge over Coach Fickert's name
in three different San Francisco
papers, I do not believe he formu
lated it. 1 refuse to believe that
he did. 1 know Charles Fickert;
I have often seen him fight for his
college; 1 have fought against him.
1 know him as too sturdy and
honorable an opponent to ever con
ceive the thoughts that have been
accredited to him.
Rut to put a stop to the deplor
able story, 1 wish to give my word
of honor, and pledge the honor of
CoachSiinpson and Captain Womble
and the entire California team to
this fact: The California football
team went, into the game and played
the game without the knowledge of
the Stanford signals.
And I wish further to say that if
that knowledge had been offered to
us, we would have spurned it; that
if it had been forced upon us we
would have apprised the Stanford
team of the fact; and that, had any
traitor to the Stanford cause
offered us the signals, he would
have been iguomiuiously driven
away from our campus.
1 am not acquainted with Mr.
Horan. 1 have not a tremendous
respect for him; he is too llippy
floppy an individual. Rut 1 must
say that the men who accuse him
of giving away the Stanford signals
do him a stinging injustice. Horan

was on our campus during the last
few days of our training. He was
there purely as a newspaper man,
and did positively no coaching.
If he had tried to do so, he would
have been promptly rebuked. In
fact we looked upon him with some
distrust, and always excluded him
from our more intimate practice,
lie was never asked the slightest
question as to the Stanford style of
play and he had the tact never to
volunteer any information.
Mr. Editor, I have been inti
mately connected with the football
men of my college for many years.
In my measure, 1 have fought for
my college as hard as any of you
have fought for the Cardinal. I
know the California man thor
oughly, I know his spirit; and I
can tell you that when the men of
Stanford accuse us of seeking vic
tory by dirty, mean, petty means,
they show that they do not know
us. That was not the spirit of the
team that went forth to battle with
yours on last Saturday. Do not
belittle that team. It' was moved
by an ardent spirit that could have
moved mountains. It was a team
that deserved the homage of frieml
and foe. Honor that team, men of
Stanford; honor it in victory as we
honor you in defeat. And may
never a few malicious tongues,
wagged at the .bidding of stunted
minds, destroy that feeling of re
spect that we of California hold
toward your Cardinal fighters, that
you of Stanford hold, I firmly be
lieve, toward the champions of the
lilue and Gold.
