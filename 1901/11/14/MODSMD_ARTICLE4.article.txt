# Sentiment of a Graduate.
## 
### 
Below is an extract of a letter
from an alumnus who was prom
inent in undergraduate activities
while in college, and deserves
notice in this paper, as it accords
with the general sentiment of the
student body.
Saoramknto, Cal., Nov. 13.
I entered Stanford when she
opened in 18S)l and I graduated
with the class of '95. During my
time there I was president of the
Associated Students and also grad
uate treasurer. With the manage
ment of the football teams I had a
great deal to do, and I have seen
every game tin; universities have
played together, so you will pardon
me if I presume to say we lost a
game which was not ours to Win.
U. C. gave every evidence of being
superior, and in Heaven's name let
us not now do what we would criti
cize U. C. for doing, that is, cry
"unfair."
To me it has ever been a matter
of intense pride that every Stan
ford man could be a prince in de
feat as well as in victory. So let
us accord to them, the U. C. team,
all the glory that is theirs. It is
unthinkable that any ex-Stanford
man could ever prove the traitor it
is alleged this one did. If it be so,
let us bury the incident in pity for
the man, and have that faith in
the honor of the U. C. team which
I know is far greater than the over
zealous undergraduate is apt to
think it. Very truly,
Lkstkk J. Hinsdalk.
