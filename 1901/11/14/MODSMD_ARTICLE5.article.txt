# "THE SIMPSON SPIRIT."
## Berkeley's Head Coach Refers to Stanford in Language That Comments on Itself. 
### 
At a huge ratification rally on
the Berkeley campus laÂ«t Mon
day Head-Coach Simpson was
loudly applauded for remarks given
below. President Benjamim Ide
Wheeler of the University of Cali
fornia spoke after the delivery of
the coach's speech. The following
report of Simpson's observations
are taken from the same issue of
the Daily Calijornian that pub
lished an editorial attack on Conch
Fickert of Stanford, labeled "The
Fickert Spirit."
"The speech-making was started
by "Doc" Simpson, coach of our
victorious team. He said in part:
'I am proud of the Blue and Gold.
California went to it light from the
start and kept up the good work
throughout the game. Boys, I
hope I shall never see the day
when California gives as poor a
support to its team as Stanford did
last Saturday, i hope never to see
California's rooters slink off as
these curs did on Saturday. Why
was Stanford the favorite? I don't
know. Was it because she had the
support of the press, or because
that Archie Rice filled you full of
rot? You supported your team
from the start, and you won; do it
every year, and you will win. The
Stanford men had rain, they had
weight, they had all they wanted,
and yet the lobsters lost.'"
