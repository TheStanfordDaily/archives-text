VVk bklikvkd the associated stu
dents of the University of Cali
fornia for the most part were men
rpj lt> anil women who could ap-
Sinipson preciate a manly, cour-
H P iri â€¢ teous, and considerate at
titude in all undergraduate ath
letics. We thought them capable
of gracefully carrying an honor
after they had fairly won it.
We naturally supposed after our
defeat that they would celebrate
victory over a rival with much
pomp and ceremony. But never
once did we expect that they would
resort to slurs and mean insinua
tions to revile a rival who had
granted that they were victorious
in a fair and honorable fight. We
expected consideration, manly for
bearance, and frank evidence of re
spect. We are shown a spirit of
hatred and jealousy, whose exist
ence we never imagined, and which
is given plain expression in the
speech of Simpson.
The disrespectful and slurring
tone in which their head coach re
fers to us is neither that of a gentle
man nor a true sportsman. For a
man in his position to use such
terms in speaking of self-respecting
opponents cannot but reflect to the
disgrace of the university which he
represents. For an editor to pub
lish an editorial on one page of
his sheet setting forth maxims of
gentlemanly conduct and on an
other quotations of a football speech
devoid of all respect is, to say
the least, inconsistent. He is held
responsible for leading us to be
lieve that this disrespect is the
true attitude of his university.
We regret that our athletics can
not he clean and healthy; devoid

of all hate and unjust jealousy.
Stanford regards the University of
California in the light of a friendly
rival, competition with whom is of
benefit to l#)th parties. California
might at least reciprocate this
spirit.
