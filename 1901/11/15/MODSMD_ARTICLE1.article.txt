## Captain Cowden Calls Coaches and Pitchers Out for Practice Monday Afternoon. 
### 
Captain Dave Cowden's call for
catchers and pitchers to be out for
practice next Monday afternoon
will probably meet with an imme
diate and hearty response from the
Stanford baseball candidates. The
captain in an interview today said:
"Although there has been no can
vass of the men here, 1 do not
doubt but what there will be many
good men out for work, and, I be
lieve, an excellent grade of batting
material. Wo are going to start in
early this year and work hard, and
with every man doing his duty, as
1 think every man will, in the way I
of training and attending the prac
tices, we ought to make a strong
light to win this series. I think
that Stanford ought to try espec
ially hard to win in every other
contest this year, after our defeat in
football. It is of great importance
that every man who can should
get out for baseball work this se
mester. The drill does not seem
much, but it gets men out and gives
a line on tlieni to the coach, who
thus can work promising material ;
into shape. We will probably have
two class games this semester. We
certainly have secured the services
of a fine coach this year, who will
have this advantage over the pro
fessional coach, that he understands
our conditions here, and (lie men
he will have to handle; for college
men need to he taught differently
from other mem Then, again,
'Swin' is full of life and ambition,
and he will make every man work
hard. We want every fellow out
Monday night who has ever pitched
or caught, and we'll try to get a
line then on the material."
One of the most promising can
didates for the position of catcher
is Traeger, who has the baseball
instinct, strength, and quickness,
and who with proper coaching will
doubtless prove a star. B. C. Mc-
Gilvray, an end on the 15)04 team,
is another man with good chances
fora baseball "S," as catcher or
pitcher. He played one season on
the Denver high school team, and
another on ihe Denver Athletic
Club. He has a good arm and is a
good hitter. Knight will be a
promising candidate for the same
position. He has lots of ginger
and is a hard hitter. Butterfield,
a Varsity sub-end, may also be out.
He is strong and steady. Stillnnin,
left tackle on the 1900 football
team, caught two years for the
Lowell High, and held the same
position on the team of the Port
land Academy. Spivalo, '05, was
on the Hoitt's School team two
years as catcher. He was captain,
and had an offer to go as a profes
sional.
Pitchers are more numerous, and
among the best is Paul Parker, '03,
last year's pitcher, whose arm has
few equals even among profession
als. With the training Swindells
will be able to give him, Barker
ought to be a winner this year.
Jimmie Tritch, '04, has excellent
form, and with the improvement in
strength he will make by a long
season, Tritch will prove an able

and crafty pitcher. IJe lias no
equal in watching bases. Ballagh,
'04, is a good little man,
who is quick and willing and
will develop into a good pitcher.
\Y\ K. Roosevelt, '03, sub-guard on
this year's football eleven, was cap
tain of the baseball tea in at Lake
Forest, where lie tilled the pitcher's
box. He has plenty of speed and
should develop into a promising
candidate.
Luce, '04, was last year's Fresh
man left fielder. He played left
field two years on the San Diego
high school team and also pitched.

He is a hard and earnest worker
and has possibilities in him of Var
sity form. McFarland, '05, of Los
Angeles, is a good short-stop and
pitcher also. Everything possible
will be done to make a lighting
second team this year, and Swin
dells will often catch on it, and
Lanagan will come down from Bel
mont to do what he can for his
college. Harry Edwards will also
don the short-sleeved shirt; and
these men will be the nucleus for
what will doubtless be the strong
est baseball team Stanford has
ever had.
