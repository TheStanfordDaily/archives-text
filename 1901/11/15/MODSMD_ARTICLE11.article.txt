We iiave not forgotten altogether
our recent difficulties in the man
agement of student body athletics.
That experience has shown us that
our present constitution is inade
quate to meet all the conditions
and questions that may arise from
time to time. Before another sea
son, we should have perfected and
adopted a scheme for the manage
ment of our athletics whereby the
present centralized system, which is
so handicapped by the vagaries of
student body politics, will be en
tirely revolutionized. Immediately
following the Nourse controversy
we submitted an outline of a plan
of management for the considera
tion and discussion of the student
body. This seems an opportune
time to re-agitate the matter. The
communication in today's issue
contains some additional ideas and
suggestions worthy of considera
tion. Its principal feature seems
to be the placing of control in the
hands of those most closely con
nected and actively interested in
athletics.
We invite an open discussion of
the proposition in our columns.
If anyone is opposed to it. we would
be glad to make the reasons for
their opposition public. Jf anyone
lias suggestions relative to the
scheme as proposed, we would like
to know them; or if anyone can j
offer a new and better plan, it
should be made known, so as to
allow time for consideration and
an open and free discussion.
