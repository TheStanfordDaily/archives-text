Our band this year excells any
of its predecessors, and makes
music which it is a pleasure to hear.
The credit for its success is due
mainly to the direction of Professor
Martin, who has been unsparing of
bis time and effort to make it an
organization in which the Univer
sity may justly take pride. The
student body is grateful both to
Professor Martin and the members,
and trusts that the close of the
football season will not mean an
entire cessation of band music.
