# " THE DEADLY PARALLEL."
## As It Was Inadvertently Printed in the " Daily Palo Alto" Last Evening. 
### 
Assistant-Coach Hopper.
" It was a team that deserved
the homage of friend and foe.
Honor that team, men of Stan
ford ; honor it in victory as we
honor you in defeat. And may
never a few malicious tongues,
wagged at the bidding of stunt
ed minds, destroy that feeling of
respect that we of California
hold toward your Cardinal light
ers, that you of Stanford hold,
1 tirrnly believe, toward the
champions of the Blue and
Gold."
J amiss Hopper.

Head-Coach Simpson.
" 1 hope never to see Califor
nia's rooters slink off as these
curs did on Saturday. Why
was Stanford the favorite? 1
don't know. Was it because
she had the support of the press,
or because that Archie Bice filled
you full of rot? You supported
your team from the start, and
you won; do it every year and
you will win. The Stanford
men had rain, they had weight,
they had all they wanted, and
yet the lobsters lost.'"
Frank Simpson.
