Mr. Ernest Fox lectured to a
small and interested audience in
room 2 this afternoon on the sub
ject of "Cooperative Lunch Clubs."
Particular interest is to establish
coffee club-rooms in the different
cities and towns of California. Al
ready such rooms are in operation
in San Jose, in Oakland, and in
Sacramento, where they furnish a
place of congeniality and refresh
ment for many men who would
otherwise be attracted by saloons.
They are successful because, being
conducted on a business basis, no
man can feel that in patronizing
them he receives charity. They
aim to be free and democratic, and
without the element of religious
teaching.
Mr. Fox gave some suggestions
for the organization of a strictly
co-operative boarding club by stu
dents on the campus. Dr. Halsey
and several others present gave
their experience in student clubs,
and spoke of difficulties which
might arise.
