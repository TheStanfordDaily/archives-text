# Experiments in Salmon Planting.
## 
### 
President Jordan recently re
ceived an adult male Quinnat sal
mon, the gift of Mr. A. 1). Hochfort
of Point Reyes, which was one of a
large run of strange fish seen for
the lirst time in Paper Mill Creek.
The fish weighed seventeen pounds.
In March H ,)7, the State Fish Com
mission of California planted 855,-
000 young fry of the Quinnat
salmon in Paper Mill Creek. As
this stream had never contained
any salmon, this experiment gave
especially good opportunities, for
the observation of the young fish.
They soon dropped down from the
stream, in which they were planted,
salmon fashion, tail first, and in
little over a month were found in
considerable number in brackish
water, some even taken at Marshall,
fifteen miies down the bay, and in
June had entirely disappeared.
