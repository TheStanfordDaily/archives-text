# ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.
## Reasons Why a Change Is Advisable, and Suggestions for Effecting It. 
### 
Now that we are again in a sober
mood, since the stress and excite
ment incident to the annual football
game have passed away, it is none
too soon to begin to lay plans for
bringing about conditions which
will give some continuity to our
athletic system, and lay the found
ations for future success in all
branches of our athletic sports. As
a means to this desirable end, the
formation of an athletic association
has been suggested, and the reasons
the writer has heard advanced at
various times for such an associa
tion seem worthy of consideration.
They are, mainly, four in number:
1. It is desired to remove the
athletic management from the
vagaries of student body politics.
2. To give some continuity to
our athletic policy by introducing
an alumni and faculty element into
athletic control.
3. To provide a way in which a
larger choice of candidates for
athletic manager may be had than
in ordinary student body elections.
4. To have a responsible body
capable of acting quickiy and to
gether when the need arises, so that
we may not be subjected to the
humiliation of having the faculty
step in and remove our officers for
us.
Undoubtedly our athletic inter
ests are safest in the hands of their
friends, their active friends, those
students who either take enough
interest in the games to put on
jerseys or spikes themselves, or else
have followed them as far as friends
and spectators until they have
some notions as to who are the best
persons to be intrusted with ath
letic control.
It has seemed to the writer, as
well as to some others, that the
above conditions could be fulfilled
by having our athletic affairs con
trolled by a board of directors
elected by an incorporated associa
tion of the foregoing class of stu
dents. This board of directors to
be comprised of, say, one member
of the faculty, at least two alumni
and say one member from the
sophomore, two from the junior
and three members from the senior
class The board to have the power
of appointing and removing the
athletic manager, and the fixing of
his salary, and the power to re
move if necessary the captain of a
team.
This is only a bare outline of a
detailed plan which has already
met with some approval, and which
will be submitted to any body
formed or appointed for the pur
pose of considering such plans.
To the end that some action may
be taken in the matter, the writer
suggests that when the football
captain for next year is elected, he
begin the preliminary work fora
successful season by calling a meet
ing of those interested in our ath
letic affairs for the purpose of
considering the formation of an
athletic association. A Senior.
