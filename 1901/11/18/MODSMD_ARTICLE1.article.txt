didates who this year entered the
preliminary debates for the Carnot
team that will meet Berkeley in
February, twelve men have been
chosen, these to form, with Carl
Hayden, the thirteen to enter the
Carnot finals. Hayden, by partici
pating in the Carnot intercollegiate
debate year before last, has the
right to avoid these preliminaries.

Cameron, '03, Copp, '02, Jones, '03,
Loofhourow, '03, Maloy, '03,
Nangle, '03, Rice, '02, Hitter, '0-1,

Friday.
Friday night in the chapel
Chairman J. F. English called a
handful of people together at the
first of the preliminary contests.
Thirteen debaters spoke, the ques
tion of Chinese exclusion being
discussed by Hitter, '04, on the af
firmative, and Brown, 02, and
Thompson, '03, on the negative;
that of the recognition of labor
unions by employers, by Everett,
'03, and Roseberry, '03, on the af
firmative, and Williams, '02, on the
negative; the establishment of the
jury system, by Loofhourow, '02,
and Jones, '02, on the affirmative,
and Ryon, '03, and Maloy, '03, on
the negative; and the question of
compulsory arbitration of labor
troubles, by Scott, '02, and Leisner,
'02, on the affirmative, and Copp,
'02, on the negative. Judges were
Professors Lewers, Hall, and Alden.
Timekeeper for the evening was
President Rice of the lntersociety
Debating League.
Hitter, in the opening debate,
spoke of the Chinese as a danger
ous element, unlimited in supply,
with no intent of settling the
country they had invaded, and
with no fusion possible between
Americans and them. Brown, for
the negative, mentioned the treat
ies between the United States and
China, the non-criminal character
of the Chinaman, and the inalien
able right of man to change his
abode. Thompson, following for
the negative, spoke of the Chinese
freedom from bossism and the lack
of justice in forcing China to be
opened to the world, while her citi
zens are refused admittance to the
United States. Hitter, in rebuttal,
declared that sentiment had no
place in legislation, and that the
celestial deserved no rights to
come to America, because be would
not become a citizen.
In the next debate, Everett al
leged the recognition of labor
unions unjust to capital and en
tirely unmerited. He said that un
scrupulous men were in control of
the labor machine, and that the
union was irresponsible. Will
iams, for the negative, declared
the principle of trades unionism
good, and the form not opposed to
the ideas of the American Consti
tution. He said that the recogni
tion Â«.f the union was a forerunner
of arbitration and mutual recog
nition of rights. Roseberry, for
the affirmative, mentioned the fact

that there are more non-union
than union men, and declared the
position of arbitrary dictation an
to who shall he hired or who shall
work wrong legally and ethically.
Loofhourow, opening the debate
on the jury system, affirmed that the
modern jury does not represent the
average sense of the community,
which can not spare its most intel
ligent men for jury service, and de
clared that a system of judges
trained in law and logic would Ue
infinitely superior to the system
which uses the untrained minds of
the average jurors. Regan, for the
negative, said that judges, either
appointed or elected, were today,
and would be in the future, sub
jected to bribery and corruption;
and he contrasted thin with the
wide comprehension and sympathy
of the man of affairs, who is more
over not seeking votes. Jones, fol
lowing for the affirmative, alleged
that the average man is incompe
tent to weigh testimony; that this
requires the acute and well-trained
mind of the judge; that the soft
hearted jury is subjected to
appeals of sentiment; and de
clared a judge from the people and
responsible to them, the only so
lution of the problem. Maloy, on
the negative, said that an educa
tional qualification for jurors is
the way out of the difficulty, de
clared the judger to be often un
willing or incompetent to decide
questions of fact, and affirmed the
best lawyers and the people in
general to lie in favor of the jury
system. Loofhourow closed in re
buttal. This debate was one of
the best of the evening; all the
candidates spoke smoothly and
logically, and the fact that three
out of four were chosen for the fi
nals of the series is evidence of the
high character of the discussion.
The fourth debate was opened by
Scott, who, in one of the most
thoughtful, sincere, and able argu
ments of the entire number given
during the course of the evening,
declared settlement of disputes be
tween labor and capital ineffective,
the endeavors of voluntary boards
a failure, and asserted that compul
sory arbitrary is effective and
lawful, moreover, in view of the
damage done to the whole public
by strikes. Copp, on the opposing
side, asserted that there are no
competent arbitrators ; that com
pulsion is foreign to the nature of
arbitration, and that for economic
reasons, the whole scheme is im
practicable. Leisner argued that
the present system is bad, and that
arbitration would be better, and
gave examples of countries without
strikes. Scott followed in a good
rebuttal, which was cut a trifle
short by the unexpected extin
guishing of the lights.
Saturday.
The debates were continued on
Saturday night. The first was on
the question, " Resolved, That the
policy of excluding Chinese from
all territory within the boundaries
of the United States should be rig
idly maintained." (The United
Slates is understood to mean only
the continental territory.) Wil
liams, '02, opened the discussion,
and he argued the following main
points: First, the Chinese do not

assimilate with us; second, they
lower wages and degrade labor;
third, they aggravate capital and
labor; fourth, their labor is not
needed. Farrar, '04, speaking on
the negative, made the points that
the Chinese cannot compete with
the Americans, that they are not
an economic factor or a political fac
tor, nor are they social equals.
Williams then followed with his
rebuttal, taking up a few of the ar
guments of his opponent.
The next question, " Hesolved,
That Congress should prohibit the
immigration into this country of all
persons who cannot read and write
some language,dependents on qual
ified immigrants excepted," was
opened by Rice, '02, as first on the
'affirmative, with an able speech.
He divided it into the following
heads: Such prohibition would in
clude those who are unfit econom
ically, politically, and socially; the
test is fair; such prohibition is feas
ible. Thiriot, '04, spoke for the
negative. He agreed with his op
ponent upon all points excepting
the one relating to dependents, and
he narrowed the question to that,
lie argued that among these de
pendents would be included all
those whom the law was made to
keep out. Rice made a good re
buttal by trying to show the prac
tical nature of the question and by
emphasizing the arguments of his
former speech.
The next debate dealt with the
question, "Resolved, That the open
advocacy of anarchy should be
punishable as a felony." Diltmar,
'03, maintained that anarchistic
tendencies are increasing, and ar
gued that as the plan proposed was
simple and effective it should be
adopted. His delivery was slow
and he was unable to cover very
much ground. Winans, '02, repre
sented the negative with good ar
guments and fair delivery. An
swering the propositions of the
affirmative, he said that uniformity
among the states was impossible,
that the line could not be drawn
between proper and improper agi
tation, and that anarchy would
thrive under opposition. He ar
gued that there were better meth
ods of dealing with it: by restrain
ing immigration, and by having a
higher standard of education.
Cameron, '03, continued for the
affirmative. He made some strong
arguments to show that advocacy
of anarchy should be punished as a
felony before it led to deeds, and
that it was in harmony with the
constitution and the penal code.
Dittmar in his rebuttal attempted
to refute some statements of the
negative.
The last debate of the evening
was, " Hesolved, That it is econom
ically disadvantageous to the
United States to own possessions in
the tropics." The speaking on this
question was excellent, especially
for the affirmative. All three made
the finals. Wagner, '02, opened.
He divided his arguments into
three divisions: One, production j
and consumption; two, exchange;
three, distribution of wealth. He
argued from these that possessions
in the tropics were economically
disadvantageous. Nangle, '03, held
the negative side. He spoke on

three points: Firstly, that a bene
fit. accrues to the merchant marine;
secondly, that ihe tropical supplies
are brought to this country cheap
ly: thirdly, that an opening is
made for Americans, Itoehr, '04,
continuing for the affirmative, re
stricted the discussion to the Phil
ippines and Porto Rico. He said
our country does not need to he
protected from over-population.
Assimilation with tropical people
would he a step backward. Own
ership will not give us trade; reci
procity will. Our possessions, as
those of England, have been eco
nomically disadvantageous. Wag
ner, closing the debate, attempted
to point out the flaws of the nega
tive. He said the opponent bad
overlooked all but trade, that ii is
not to the best economic interest to
encourage the shipping trust, and
that American producers would be
cheated by introducing cheap trop
ical exports.
Criticism.
Of the preliminaries in general
Professor 11. M. Alden of the
English departmeat, a Phi Beta
Kappa and an ex-varsity debater
from Harvard, author of "Alden's
Art of Debate," a standard text
book on oral debate, said today in
an interview: "1 thought the try
outs good, indeed; the interest and
spirit shown rather above the aver
age. Both Professor Hall and my
self are of the opinion that the pre
liminaries were in every way ex
cellent, and that few, if any, of the
trials at Harvard have come up to
the grade of work done here on
these two evenings."
Professor J. P. Hall, also a
wearer of the Phi Beta Kappa em
blem, and also a Harvard ex
varsity debater, and a member of
the Harvard Union, a large de
bating society, Paid in an interview
later in the day: "They were
among the best lot of preliminaries
I have ever heard anywhere. I
have listened to a good many de
bates at Harvard and at Cornell,
and while these universities have
had more men to use, and many
more have entered the trials, their
average has not been nearly so
high as that here at Stanford. The
men all did well. They nearly all
seem to have good voices; and
their delivery was very creditable,
1 should say, to the instructor in
Elocution."
Out of a total of twenty-two can
didates who this year entered the
preliminary debates for the Carnot
team that will meet Berkeley in
February, twelve men have been
chosen, these to form, with Carl
Hayden, the thirteen to enter the

affirmative, he said that uniformity
among the states was impossible,
that the line could not be drawn
between proper and improper agi
tation, and that anarchy would
thrive under opposition. He ar
gued that there were better meth
ods of dealing with it: by restrain
ing immigration, and by having a
higher standard of education.
Cameron, '03, continued for the
affirmative. He made some strong
arguments to show that advocacy
of anarchy should be punished as a
felony before it led to deeds, and
that it was in harmony with the
constitution and the penal code.
Dittmar in his rebuttal attempted
to refute some statements of the
negative.
The last debate of the evening
was, " Hesolved, That it is econom
ically disadvantageous to the
United States to own possessions in
the tropics." The speaking on this
question was excellent, especially
for the affirmative. All three made
the finals. Wagner, '02, opened.
He divided his arguments into
three divisions: One, production j
and consumption; two, exchange;
three, distribution of wealth. He
argued from these that possessions
in the tropics were economically
disadvantageous. Nangle, '03, held
the negative side. He spoke on

three points: Firstly, that a bene
fit. accrues to the merchant marine;
secondly, that ihe tropical supplies
are brought to this country cheap
ly: thirdly, that an opening is
made for Americans, Itoehr, '04,
continuing for the affirmative, re
stricted the discussion to the Phil
ippines and Porto Rico. He said
our country does not need to he
protected from over-population.
Assimilation with tropical people
would he a step backward. Own
ership will not give us trade; reci
procity will. Our possessions, as
those of England, have been eco
nomically disadvantageous. Wag
ner, closing the debate, attempted
to point out the flaws of the nega
tive. He said the opponent bad
overlooked all but trade, that ii is
not to the best economic interest to
encourage the shipping trust, and
that American producers would be
cheated by introducing cheap trop

Of the preliminaries in general
Professor 11. M. Alden of the
English departmeat, a Phi Beta
Kappa and an ex-varsity debater
from Harvard, author of "Alden's
Art of Debate," a standard text
book on oral debate, said today in
an interview: "1 thought the try
outs good, indeed; the interest and
spirit shown rather above the aver
age. Both Professor Hall and my
self are of the opinion that the pre
liminaries were in every way ex
cellent, and that few, if any, of the
trials at Harvard have come up to
the grade of work done here on
these two evenings."
Professor J. P. Hall, also a
wearer of the Phi Beta Kappa em
blem, and also a Harvard ex
varsity debater, and a member of
the Harvard Union, a large de
bating society, Paid in an interview
later in the day: "They were
among the best lot of preliminaries
I have ever heard anywhere. I
have listened to a good many de
bates at Harvard and at Cornell,
and while these universities have
had more men to use, and many
more have entered the trials, their
average has not been nearly so
high as that here at Stanford. The
men all did well. They nearly all
seem to have good voices; and
their delivery was very creditable,
1 should say, to the instructor in
Elocution."
Out of a total of twenty-two can
didates who this year entered the
preliminary debates for the Carnot
team that will meet Berkeley in
February, twelve men have been
chosen, these to form, with Carl
Hayden, the thirteen to enter the
Carnot finals. Hayden, by partici

debate year before last, has the
right to avoid these preliminaries.
The other twelve debaters are:

Friday.
Friday night in the chapel
Chairman J. F. English called a
handful of people together at the
first of the preliminary contests.
Thirteen debaters spoke, the ques
tion of Chinese exclusion being
discussed by Hitter, '04, on the af
firmative, and Brown, 02, and
Thompson, '03, on the negative;
that of the recognition of labor
unions by employers, by Everett,
'03, and Roseberry, '03, on the af
firmative, and Williams, '02, on the
negative; the establishment of the
jury system, by Loofhourow, '02,
and Jones, '02, on the affirmative,
and Ryon, '03, and Maloy, '03, on
the negative; and the question of
compulsory arbitration of labor
troubles, by Scott, '02, and Leisner,
'02, on the affirmative, and Copp,
'02, on the negative. Judges were
Professors Lewers, Hall, and Alden.
Timekeeper for the evening was
President Rice of the lntersociety
Debating League.
Hitter, in the opening debate,
spoke of the Chinese as a danger
ous element, unlimited in supply,
with no intent of settling the
country they had invaded, and
with no fusion possible between
Americans and them. Brown, for
the negative, mentioned the treat
ies between the United States and
China, the non-criminal character
of the Chinaman, and the inalien
able right of man to change his
abode. Thompson, following for
the negative, spoke of the Chinese
freedom from bossism and the lack
of justice in forcing China to be
opened to the world, while her citi
zens are refused admittance to the
United States. Hitter, in rebuttal,
declared that sentiment had no
place in legislation, and that the
celestial deserved no rights to
come to America, because be would
not become a citizen.
In the next debate, Everett al
leged the recognition of labor
unions unjust to capital and en
tirely unmerited. He said that un
scrupulous men were in control of
the labor machine, and that the
union was irresponsible. Will
iams, for the negative, declared
the principle of trades unionism
good, and the form not opposed to
the ideas of the American Consti
tution. He said that the recogni
tion Â«.f the union was a forerunner
of arbitration and mutual recog
nition of rights. Roseberry, for
the affirmative, mentioned the fact

that there are more non-union
than union men, and declared the
position of arbitrary dictation an
to who shall he hired or who shall
work wrong legally and ethically.
Loofhourow, opening the debate
on the jury system, affirmed that the
modern jury does not represent the
average sense of the community,
which can not spare its most intel
ligent men for jury service, and de
clared that a system of judges
trained in law and logic would Ue
infinitely superior to the system
which uses the untrained minds of
the average jurors. Regan, for the
negative, said that judges, either
appointed or elected, were today,
and would be in the future, sub
jected to bribery and corruption;
and he contrasted thin with the
wide comprehension and sympathy
of the man of affairs, who is more
over not seeking votes. Jones, fol
lowing for the affirmative, alleged
that the average man is incompe
tent to weigh testimony; that this
requires the acute and well-trained
mind of the judge; that the soft
hearted jury is subjected to
appeals of sentiment; and de
clared a judge from the people and
responsible to them, the only so
lution of the problem. Maloy, on
the negative, said that an educa
tional qualification for jurors is
the way out of the difficulty, de
clared the judger to be often un
willing or incompetent to decide
questions of fact, and affirmed the
best lawyers and the people in
general to lie in favor of the jury
system. Loofhourow closed in re
buttal. This debate was one of
the best of the evening; all the
candidates spoke smoothly and
logically, and the fact that three
out of four were chosen for the fi
nals of the series is evidence of the
high character of the discussion.
The fourth debate was opened by
Scott, who, in one of the most
thoughtful, sincere, and able argu
ments of the entire number given
during the course of the evening,
declared settlement of disputes be
tween labor and capital ineffective,
the endeavors of voluntary boards
a failure, and asserted that compul
sory arbitrary is effective and
lawful, moreover, in view of the
damage done to the whole public
by strikes. Copp, on the opposing
side, asserted that there are no
competent arbitrators ; that com
pulsion is foreign to the nature of
arbitration, and that for economic
reasons, the whole scheme is im
practicable. Leisner argued that
the present system is bad, and that
arbitration would be better, and
gave examples of countries without
strikes. Scott followed in a good
rebuttal, which was cut a trifle
short by the unexpected extin
guishing of the lights.
Saturday.
The debates were continued on
Saturday night. The first was on
the question, " Resolved, That the
policy of excluding Chinese from
all territory within the boundaries
of the United States should be rig
idly maintained." (The United
Slates is understood to mean only
the continental territory.) Wil
liams, '02, opened the discussion,
and he argued the following main
points: First, the Chinese do not

assimilate with us; second, they
lower wages and degrade labor;
third, they aggravate capital and
labor; fourth, their labor is not
needed. Farrar, '04, speaking on
the negative, made the points that
the Chinese cannot compete with
the Americans, that they are not
an economic factor or a political fac
tor, nor are they social equals.
Williams then followed with his
rebuttal, taking up a few of the ar
guments of his opponent.
The next question, " Hesolved,
That Congress should prohibit the
immigration into this country of all
persons who cannot read and write
some language,dependents on qual
ified immigrants excepted," was
opened by Rice, '02, as first on the
'affirmative, with an able speech.
He divided it into the following
heads: Such prohibition would in
clude those who are unfit econom
ically, politically, and socially; the
test is fair; such prohibition is feas
ible. Thiriot, '04, spoke for the
negative. He agreed with his op
ponent upon all points excepting
the one relating to dependents, and
he narrowed the question to that,
lie argued that among these de
pendents would be included all
those whom the law was made to
keep out. Rice made a good re
buttal by trying to show the prac
tical nature of the question and by
emphasizing the arguments of his
former speech.
The next debate dealt with the
question, "Resolved, That the open
advocacy of anarchy should be
punishable as a felony." Diltmar,
'03, maintained that anarchistic
tendencies are increasing, and ar
gued that as the plan proposed was
simple and effective it should be
adopted. His delivery was slow
and he was unable to cover very
much ground. Winans, '02, repre
sented the negative with good ar
guments and fair delivery. An
swering the propositions of the
affirmative, he said that uniformity
among the states was impossible,
that the line could not be drawn
between proper and improper agi
tation, and that anarchy would
thrive under opposition. He ar
gued that there were better meth

general to lie in favor of the jury
system. Loofhourow closed in re
buttal. This debate was one of
the best of the evening; all the
candidates spoke smoothly and
logically, and the fact that three
out of four were chosen for the fi
nals of the series is evidence of the
high character of the discussion.
The fourth debate was opened by
Scott, who, in one of the most
thoughtful, sincere, and able argu
ments of the entire number given
during the course of the evening,
declared settlement of disputes be
tween labor and capital ineffective,
the endeavors of voluntary boards
a failure, and asserted that compul
sory arbitrary is effective and
lawful, moreover, in view of the
damage done to the whole public
by strikes. Copp, on the opposing
side, asserted that there are no
competent arbitrators ; that com
pulsion is foreign to the nature of
arbitration, and that for economic
reasons, the whole scheme is im
practicable. Leisner argued that
the present system is bad, and that
arbitration would be better, and
gave examples of countries without
strikes. Scott followed in a good
rebuttal, which was cut a trifle
short by the unexpected extin
guishing of the lights.
Saturday.
The debates were continued on
Saturday night. The first was on
the question, " Resolved, That the
policy of excluding Chinese from
all territory within the boundaries
of the United States should be rig
idly maintained." (The United
Slates is understood to mean only
the continental territory.) Wil
liams, '02, opened the discussion,
and he argued the following main
points: First, the Chinese do not

assimilate with us; second, they
lower wages and degrade labor;
third, they aggravate capital and
labor; fourth, their labor is not
needed. Farrar, '04, speaking on
the negative, made the points that
the Chinese cannot compete with
the Americans, that they are not
an economic factor or a political fac
tor, nor are they social equals.
Williams then followed with his
rebuttal, taking up a few of the ar
guments of his opponent.
The next question, " Hesolved,
That Congress should prohibit the
immigration into this country of all
persons who cannot read and write
some language,dependents on qual
ified immigrants excepted," was
opened by Rice, '02, as first on the
'affirmative, with an able speech.
He divided it into the following
heads: Such prohibition would in
clude those who are unfit econom
ically, politically, and socially; the
test is fair; such prohibition is feas
ible. Thiriot, '04, spoke for the
negative. He agreed with his op
ponent upon all points excepting
the one relating to dependents, and
he narrowed the question to that,
lie argued that among these de
pendents would be included all
those whom the law was made to
keep out. Rice made a good re
buttal by trying to show the prac
tical nature of the question and by
emphasizing the arguments of his
former speech.
The next debate dealt with the
question, "Resolved, That the open
advocacy of anarchy should be
punishable as a felony." Diltmar,
'03, maintained that anarchistic
tendencies are increasing, and ar
gued that as the plan proposed was
simple and effective it should be
adopted. His delivery was slow
and he was unable to cover very
much ground. Winans, '02, repre
sented the negative with good ar
guments and fair delivery. An
swering the propositions of the
affirmative, he said that uniformity
among the states was impossible,
that the line could not be drawn
between proper and improper agi
tation, and that anarchy would
thrive under opposition. He ar
gued that there were better meth
ods of dealing with it: by restrain
ing immigration, and by having a
higher standard of education.
Cameron, '03, continued for the
affirmative. He made some strong
arguments to show that advocacy
of anarchy should be punished as a
felony before it led to deeds, and
that it was in harmony with the
constitution and the penal code.
Dittmar in his rebuttal attempted
to refute some statements of the
negative.
The last debate of the evening
was, " Hesolved, That it is econom
ically disadvantageous to the
United States to own possessions in
the tropics." The speaking on this
question was excellent, especially
for the affirmative. All three made
the finals. Wagner, '02, opened.
He divided his arguments into
three divisions: One, production j
and consumption; two, exchange;
three, distribution of wealth. He
argued from these that possessions
in the tropics were economically
disadvantageous. Nangle, '03, held
the negative side. He spoke on

three points: Firstly, that a bene
fit. accrues to the merchant marine;
secondly, that ihe tropical supplies
are brought to this country cheap
ly: thirdly, that an opening is
made for Americans, Itoehr, '04,
continuing for the affirmative, re
stricted the discussion to the Phil
ippines and Porto Rico. He said
our country does not need to he
protected from over-population.
Assimilation with tropical people
would he a step backward. Own
ership will not give us trade; reci
procity will. Our possessions, as
those of England, have been eco
nomically disadvantageous. Wag
ner, closing the debate, attempted
to point out the flaws of the nega
tive. He said the opponent bad
overlooked all but trade, that ii is
not to the best economic interest to
encourage the shipping trust, and
that American producers would be
cheated by introducing cheap trop
ical exports.

Of the preliminaries in general
Professor 11. M. Alden of the
English departmeat, a Phi Beta
Kappa and an ex-varsity debater
from Harvard, author of "Alden's
Art of Debate," a standard text
book on oral debate, said today in
an interview: "1 thought the try
outs good, indeed; the interest and
spirit shown rather above the aver
age. Both Professor Hall and my
self are of the opinion that the pre
liminaries were in every way ex
cellent, and that few, if any, of the
trials at Harvard have come up to
the grade of work done here on
these two evenings."
Professor J. P. Hall, also a
wearer of the Phi Beta Kappa em
blem, and also a Harvard ex
varsity debater, and a member of
the Harvard Union, a large de
bating society, Paid in an interview
later in the day: "They were
among the best lot of preliminaries
I have ever heard anywhere. I
have listened to a good many de
bates at Harvard and at Cornell,
and while these universities have
had more men to use, and many
more have entered the trials, their
average has not been nearly so
high as that here at Stanford. The
men all did well. They nearly all
seem to have good voices; and
their delivery was very creditable,
1 should say, to the instructor in
Elocution."
Out of a total of twenty-two can
didates who this year entered the
preliminary debates for the Carnot
team that will meet Berkeley in
February, twelve men have been
chosen, these to form, with Carl
Hayden, the thirteen to enter the
Carnot finals. Hayden, by partici
pating in the Carnot intercollegiate
debate year before last, has the
right to avoid these preliminaries.
The other twelve debaters are:
Cameron, '03, Copp, '02, Jones, '03,
Loofhourow, '03, Maloy, '03,
Nangle, '03, Rice, '02, Hitter, '0-1,
Roehr, '04, Scott, '02, Wagner, '02,
and Williams, '02.
Friday.
Friday night in the chapel
Chairman J. F. English called a
handful of people together at the
first of the preliminary contests.
Thirteen debaters spoke, the ques
tion of Chinese exclusion being
discussed by Hitter, '04, on the af
firmative, and Brown, 02, and
Thompson, '03, on the negative;
that of the recognition of labor
unions by employers, by Everett,
'03, and Roseberry, '03, on the af
firmative, and Williams, '02, on the
negative; the establishment of the
jury system, by Loofhourow, '02,
and Jones, '02, on the affirmative,
and Ryon, '03, and Maloy, '03, on
the negative; and the question of
compulsory arbitration of labor
troubles, by Scott, '02, and Leisner,
'02, on the affirmative, and Copp,
'02, on the negative. Judges were
Professors Lewers, Hall, and Alden.
Timekeeper for the evening was
President Rice of the lntersociety
Debating League.
Hitter, in the opening debate,
spoke of the Chinese as a danger
ous element, unlimited in supply,
with no intent of settling the
country they had invaded, and
with no fusion possible between
Americans and them. Brown, for
the negative, mentioned the treat
ies between the United States and
China, the non-criminal character
of the Chinaman, and the inalien
able right of man to change his
abode. Thompson, following for
the negative, spoke of the Chinese
freedom from bossism and the lack
of justice in forcing China to be
opened to the world, while her citi
zens are refused admittance to the
United States. Hitter, in rebuttal,
declared that sentiment had no
place in legislation, and that the
celestial deserved no rights to
come to America, because be would
not become a citizen.
In the next debate, Everett al
leged the recognition of labor
unions unjust to capital and en
tirely unmerited. He said that un
scrupulous men were in control of
the labor machine, and that the
union was irresponsible. Will
iams, for the negative, declared
the principle of trades unionism
good, and the form not opposed to
the ideas of the American Consti
tution. He said that the recogni
tion Â«.f the union was a forerunner
of arbitration and mutual recog
nition of rights. Roseberry, for
the affirmative, mentioned the fact

that there are more non-union
than union men, and declared the
position of arbitrary dictation an
to who shall he hired or who shall
work wrong legally and ethically.
Loofhourow, opening the debate
on the jury system, affirmed that the
modern jury does not represent the
average sense of the community,
which can not spare its most intel
ligent men for jury service, and de
clared that a system of judges
trained in law and logic would Ue
infinitely superior to the system
which uses the untrained minds of
the average jurors. Regan, for the
negative, said that judges, either
appointed or elected, were today,
and would be in the future, sub
jected to bribery and corruption;
and he contrasted thin with the
wide comprehension and sympathy
of the man of affairs, who is more
over not seeking votes. Jones, fol
lowing for the affirmative, alleged
that the average man is incompe
tent to weigh testimony; that this
requires the acute and well-trained
mind of the judge; that the soft
hearted jury is subjected to
appeals of sentiment; and de
clared a judge from the people and
responsible to them, the only so
lution of the problem. Maloy, on
the negative, said that an educa
tional qualification for jurors is
the way out of the difficulty, de
clared the judger to be often un
willing or incompetent to decide
questions of fact, and affirmed the
best lawyers and the people in
general to lie in favor of the jury
system. Loofhourow closed in re
buttal. This debate was one of
the best of the evening; all the
candidates spoke smoothly and

out of four were chosen for the fi
