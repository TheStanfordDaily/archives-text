# UNTIL SPRING
## Mrs. Stanford Will Allow the Camp to Remain Until Spring. 
### 
11. F. Coolidge, manager of the
Camp, has received a letter from
Mrs. Stanford Buying that, after
considering the matter of the re
moval of the Camp buildings in
the light in which he had stated it
to her, namely, that the men had
figured on their expenses for the
year and could not change at this
season without great inconvenience,
she had decided to allow them
to remain until after the end of
next semester. This action of Mrs.
Stanfordjwas unexpected, as she has
already allowed the Camp to con
tinue several years longer than was
originally intended. It is certain,
however, that it will he torn
down sometime during the next va
cation months. The Camp restaur
ant will continue operations at the
same place until then.
