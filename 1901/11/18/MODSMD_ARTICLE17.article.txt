# Stanford Dinner.
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Stanford men in Southern
California will probably give a
dinner to the football team on the
30th of this month, in Los Ange
les. We think that a number of
Stanford men will come south at
that time with the team, so I am
going to ask you to make a note of
this in the paper and request that
all men intending to come south at
that time write me of their inten
tion, so that we c;in provide places
for them at the table. The dinner
tickets will probably lie $2, and we
are planning to-seat at least a hun
dred. Very sincerely yours,
Fred B. Hraden,
