# Daring Co-Eds at Northwestern.
## 
### 
The co-eds of Northwestern Uni
versity have gained quite a little
notoriety as the result of two
daring feats which they accom
plished last Saturday. With hun
dreds of students as spectators a
freshman crept along the edge of
the roof of Willard Hall and nailed
the class colors on the topmost
point. The roof is sixty feet ahove
the ground and a strong wind was
blowing from the lake, which made
it so perilous that many turned
away in horror. The freshman
co-ed had scarcely descended when
the daring act was duplicated hy a
hrave sophomore girl.
