### 
I)r. William 11. Tolman, secre
tary of the League for Social Serv
ice in New York, lectured in the
chapel yesterday on "Social and
Industrial Betterment." In open
ing his discussion Dr.Tolman said:
"One of the great needs of the
times has come to he a point of
contact and communication be
tween the many organizations
which, inspired hy the growing al
truistic spirit, are trying to make
their communities better places to
live in. If we profit only hy our
experience, we learn slowly and
pay a high tuition fee. It is much
wiser to profit hy the successes and
failures of others and so get our
tuition free.
"We need, therefore, a social
clearing house; and to supply this
need is one of the chief aims of the
League for Social Service of New
York. The experiments of recent
years thrown not a little light
on methods of social betterment,
but this light is, for the most part,
diffused. The League for Social
Service of New York is a lens to
gather up these scattered rays,
focalize them and reflect them
wherever they are desired; and
this it does largely through its
monthly magazine, Social Service
The lecture was illustrated with
one hundred and eighty lantern
slides, illustrating conditions in
typical industrial betterment com
munities of England, France, Hol
land, Germany, and the United
States. The speaker told of the
work of William H. Lever of Lever
Bros., Ltd., at Port Sunlight, Eng
land; of the village community
built up by Richard Cadburg at
Brownville, near Birmingham; of
the mutual aid society of coal
miners in Northern France; of the
work of .1. C. Van Marcan cfc Co.,
in Holland; and of the Krupp set
tlement in Germany. Although
European civilization has been in
advance of the United States in
recognition of the needs for social
betterment, the problem is being
handled with increased interest in
this country. The speaker gave an
interesting discussion on the work
done and advancement made by
such establishments as the West
inghouse Air Brake Company of
Wilmerding, Pa.; the Briar-Cliff
Farms of New York; the Sherwin-
Williams Company of Cleveland;
and the 11. J. Heinz Company of
Pittsburg.
An innovation recently made by
one concern is the employment of
a, "social secretary," whose duty is
to superintend and promote the
social welfare of the employes. This
offers a tield for college students to
translate their theoretical ideas
into practice.
