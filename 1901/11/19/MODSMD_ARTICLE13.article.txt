Such a proposal as that reported
tlirough the Examiner, if it is au
thentic, can scarcely h»ve been
made by one who understands the
conditions thoroughly. At this
late date, after the big game has
been played and the climax of the
season passed, it would be out of
the question to arrange two more
contests which would in any way
show the football teams in Varsity
form. Two secondary games have
already been scheduled for Stan
ford, one at Los Angeles and one
with Pomona College. With due
appreciation for the offer from a
"Stanford enthusiast" to present
a $1,000 cup for the winner of two
out of three games to be played
between the universities yet this
season, Stanford cannot ask the
men who have already given so
much of their time and energy to
make further sacrifice. The big
game of the year has been played
and decided. "Impromptu" con
tests would excite little interest, ex
cept, perhaps, to promote continued
vituperation.
