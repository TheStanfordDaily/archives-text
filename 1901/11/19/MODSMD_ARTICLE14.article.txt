With the departure of C. B. liaitt,
Stanford and the Pacific Coast lose
one of the most brilliant football
players ever seen in the West. The
announcement that Mr. lliiitt has
left the University to be married
Saturday, and that he will go im
mediately to Winnipeg, Manitoba,
to accept a permanent position,
was a surprise to all but his most
intimate friends here. While it is
hard to reconcile ourselves to his
loss from the grid-iron and as a
fellow student, the Daily Palo

Alto can but voice the unanimous
sentiment of the student body in
wishing him the fullest measure of
success and happiness.
