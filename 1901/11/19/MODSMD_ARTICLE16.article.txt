The following article on Coach
Yost by Sherman R. Duffy, the
football expert, appeared in the
American of Chicago the other day:
,{ F. PI. Yost, coach of the Wolver
ines, is the most unique figure in
Western football this fall, and be
fore the season is over it is likely
he will have added another brilliant
season to the most remarkable
coaching career of any player who
ever donned the mole skins.
" Yost is a football crank, pure
and simple. He does not coach be
cause he needs the money or be
cause it is a good way to pick up a
little extra coin, as he is pretty well
fixed in this world's goods, and owns
valuable coal property in West Vir
ginia; but be coaches just because
he likes to and is a football crank
through and through, lie talks of
nothing but football, dreams of
nothing but football —in fact he al
most might be said to eat and
drink nothing but football from
morning till night.
"Y'ost has the faculty so many
coaches have not, of imparting ali
lie knows about football, —and he
knows a lot. Other coaches may
know more, possibly, but they have
not the instructive faculty. As a
good football pedagogue, Yost is
probably the best in the country,
and he would confer a lasting bene
fit on many teams if he would es
tablish a football normal school for
the instruction of coaches in the
methods of teaching.
"But Yost is not merely a foot
ball theorist. He can put into
practice the theories for every posi
tion better than any coach now in
the West. Fast as a streak, he can
heat any man on the Michigan
squad down the field. If he plays
at end to show the fine points of the
position he is the first end down
the field, and the same if he plays
half, and so on. Each coach, as a
rule, can coach one position better
than another. Yost seems to know
them all equally well."
