Rev. Sidney C. Partridge, I'Opis
copalian bishop at Kyoto, Japan,
and one of the most eloquent
orators who have been heard here

Problem of Christianity in Japan."
After describing and praising the
people of that picturesque island
empire, he concluded that our debt
of truest sympathy to them would
be paid by the introduction of
Christianity. Not an aggressive
displacement of the traditions now
potent in Japan, but a harmon
izing of them with the influence of
the Christian religion.
