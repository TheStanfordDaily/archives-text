# First Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon an even
dozen men appeared in uniform on
the old baseball diamond, having
come out in response to Captain
Cowden's call for candidates for
batting positions. Seven of the
players, who announced themselves
as ambitious for pitching honors,
lined up in a, row and amused
themselves for half an hour in
playing toss and catch with the
quartet of catchers. Coach ►Swin
dells and Cowden were out and
both were full of pointers for the
new men.
Besides Parker, last season's
twirler, Ballagh, '04, Triteh, '04,
Lowenthal, '03, McFarland, '05,
and Roosevelt, '03, were in the box.
Blake, '05, Scales, '04, Traeger, '03,
Splivalo, '05, and Knight, '03, did
the receiving. The men were nil
worked easily, and comparison was
of course impossible.
It was learned today that sur
vevors for the Southern Pacific are
at work laying out a route for a
spur track which will cut the dia
mond on which practice is being
held exactly in two. The track
that now extends from Encina to
the power-house is dilapidated and
crooked, and the railroad men,
after consultation with the resident
architect, has decided that the
baseball held must be sacrificed in
order that a few rods of track may
be straightened. The work is in
charge of D'Arcy Porter, '95.
