# RAITT HAS GONE.
## To Wed Saturday.—Will Locate in Winnipeg.—Has Played His Last College Game. 
### 
Last night a little, quiet fellow
stepped on a south-bound train at
the Palo Alto station and watched
town and arboretum fade away in
the darkness. There was no crowd
of students to see him off, this
silent, decisive little fellow, for of
the hundreds of Stanford men who
watched him play the game, only
two or three knew that he was
about to leave his Alma Mater.
And "stubby" Raitt, the man who
has done more than nearly any
other player to help Stanford's foot
ball team, left her without receiv
ing the parting honor of a yell.
Probably he never knew what Stan
ford people thought of him; may
be he never cared. For in San
Bernardino there waits for him a
girl who will next Saturday be his
bride.
Raltt, whom "Dad" Moulton and
others who knew, including Frank
Slaker, Chicago's star, declare one
of the best quarter-backs in the
United States and second only to
.Johnnie Baird of Princeton, has
played the game on only two other
teams before coming here, that
of the San Bernardino high school
and of the San Bernardino Athletic
Club. He won his Stanford class
emblem in 1.599, when he played
quarter on the victorious 1908
Freshman team, which lie also cap
tained. During the same year he
went into the intercollegiate Var
sity contest in "Chet" Murphy's
place as quarter, displaying ex
cellent form. Last year, although
he was called home in the middle
of the season by the sickness and
death of iiis father, he returned in
time to help the Cardinal team win.
But next year a new voice will
call out "Stop 'em up, fellows!"
for Raitt has in the same silent
manner in which he played the
game slipped away forever. Miss
Nettie Mee, who will soon be
Nettie Mee Raitt, was a student at
the San Bernardino high school,
graduating in 1898, while Raitt
graduated a year later. She has
been attending the Los Angeles
Normal School for three years and
she left the school at the same time
this fall that Raitt came so near
leaving Stanford.
After the marriage Saturday at
the home of John Mee, the father
of the bride, the ex-Stanford man
will leave immediately with liis
wife for Winnipeg, Manitoba,
where his uncle, Charles Raitt,
master mechanic of the Canadian
Pacific Railroad shops, has secured
for "Stubber" a good position in
the car and machine shops of the
road. He leaves the Coast and
leaves Stanford and her football
team forever.
