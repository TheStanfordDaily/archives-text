A branch laboratory for petro
graphic work has been established
at the University by 11. W.Turner,
expert petrographer of the United
States Geological Survey. Mr.
Turner hopes to have most of the
material, containing 0,000 or 8,000
specimens, which he lias collected
during the last two years, worked
up for reports in the bulletins of
the geological survey. He has
already sent several large collec
tions, including one from the.Silver
Peak range in Nevada, one from
the Sierra Nevadas of Northern
California, one from Yosemite and
the Southern Sierra Nevadas, col
lections from Mt. Lyal and Mt.
Dana, and a miscellaneous lot of
specimens from Texas. With each
collection is a complete group of
photographic slides.
The material is of great interest
to geological and mining students,
who have free access to it. Ulti
mately, Mr. Turner expects to turn
most of it over to the University,
reserving typical specimens for the
museum of the California State
Mining Bureau in the Ferry build
ing at San Francisco. All the
Sierra collection is from the gold
bearing belt of Northern California,
and the published reports will be
of valuable service to mining men
and geologists. The Texas collec
tion is composed mainly of cinni
bar specimens, which will supply
useful data to quicksilver miners.
