# BASEBALL CANDIDATES.
## Light Work Done Last Night By Men on the Diamond.â€” No Hard Practice. 
### 
There was a small number of
candidates for the baseball team
on the diamond last night. About
eighteen men appeared, and were
put through light infield practice.
There was no attempt made to line
up the men in positions, and the
whole time during practice was
given up to working the men on
easy ground-hits. No outlield
practice was given. Praker, Var
sity pitcher last year, warmed up
a short time with Knight.
The number of men who were
out last night is but a small per
centage of the baseball material
now in college, and it is to be hoped
that twice as many candidates will
show up on Saturday. Captain
Cowden expressed himself well
pleased with the showing made and
the work done. It is not his inten
tion to put the men through any
hard practice this fall, as the main
idea of this early call is to get a
line of the new players and to de
termine the prospects for next
spring.
In addition to Parker, Brown,
Lowenthal, and Cowden, the fol
lowing men were out: Tarpey,
Warfield, Knight, Ballagh, Roose
velt, Studley, Bartell, Luce, Still
man, Copp, Tritch, Kellogg, and
Blake. Several of the new men
made a good showing for them
selves. Roosevelt and Tarpey
were both quick in gathering in
grounders and threw well to bases.
