As suggested by Mr. Gilder
sleeve in his communication pub
lished this evening, a meeting of
those interested in the formation of
an athletic association would bring
good results. From the articles
appearing thus far, in discussion of
the subject, it seems that no one
will advocate a continuance of the
present scheme. Everybody recog
nizes the need for more adequate
organization; the only question is
upon the best method of accom
plishing the result. If a meeting
is held, the ideas of those who have
studied the subject may be ad
vanced and compared, giving a
committee, which could be ap
pointed to draw up plans, some
definite basis upon which to begin
work. Meanwhile the Daily Palo
Alto will gladly continue to pub
lish communications which treat
the subject from a thoughtful
attitude.
