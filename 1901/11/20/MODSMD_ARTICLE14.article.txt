# Relieves All Doubt.
## 
### 
The paragraph given below is
from the Dally Califomian. it is
one of the patches in a long editor
ial effort from that oracle of Berke
ley spirit.
"To relieve all doubt as to the
attitude of the Califomian in re
gard to Simpson's speech, we would
state that we believe that Mr.
Simpson made a grave mistake in
speaking as lie did of the students
of Stanford University. No one
regrets it more than we do. But
he, at least, was man enough to
say what he thought in plain,
straight Englishâ€”in English which

left nothing to be doubted, and left
nothing to be imagined. We re
peat that he made a grave mistake,
that be spoke in a way in which
he had no business to speak, but
we hold that he did not act the part
of a snake in the grass."
