Editor Palo Alto:
In this communication I am re
plying to a request from the editor
of the Daily Palo Alto, who de
sires further discussion upon the
proposed plan of forming an ath
letic association here at Stanford.
This is surely a much needed re
form. We want more unity and
concentration. The present system
may have been all right years ago,
hut it has heen sadly lacking in
effectiveness for at least three
years. What we should have here
is an athletic association like that
of Harvard or Cornell. By such
an organization some clearly out
lined and definite policy would be
created. In that kind of an asso
ciation we would have a governing
board composed of representatives
from the undergraduates, the grad
utes, and the faculty, thereby
avoiding such disgraceful conflicts
as took place during the past year.
Really, the very best way to get
at this matter is to call a meeting
of those interested in this new
athletic association and discuss the
affair. We may write reams on
the subject and talk aimlessly, as
we have talked, for years, but
nothing will he accomplished until
there get together those men who
are representatives of every phase
of our college life —together with
those 1 >yal friends of the faculty
who are ever ready to give us the
best of their experience. Let us
come together, then, and determine
upon some definite and far-sighted
policy that will place our athletics
upon a. firmer foundation.
