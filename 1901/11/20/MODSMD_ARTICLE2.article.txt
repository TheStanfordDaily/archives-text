# Second-Team Trip.
## 
### 
Treasurer Edwards announced
this afternoon that the second team
will probably have a trip during
the Christinas holidays. They will
go either to Salt Lake City to play
an eleven of the University of Utah,
or to Portland, Oregon, to meet the
players of the Multnomah Club.
