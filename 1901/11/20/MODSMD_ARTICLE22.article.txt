University of Washington Women
Parade with Brooms and Dish
pans, Denouncing President.
An Associated Press dispatch
from Seattle, Wash., this morning
relates an interesting state of affairs
at the University of Washington.
It is as follows:
"Because President Graves of the
University of Washington wan
dered through the pretty co-eds'
rooms to see if there waß any truth
in the report that they were not
tidy, there is a hot old time on in
the big institution, it is said that
the president compared some of the
rooms to pig-pens, and berated the
niece of Major Robinson, United
States quartermaster, until she
dropped to the Moor weeping.
"The girls held an indignation
meeting, at which President Graves
was present without invitation.
He was accorded scant courtesy,
and Miss Gardiner and Miss Dod
son, upper-class women, told him
in plain language what they
thought of him.
"The climax came when fifty
girls, armed with brooms and dish
pans, circled the university build
ings three times,and, halting under
President Graves' window, sang a
song to the tune of 'We've Got a
Pig in the Parlor.' The fight
originated over trouble concerning
the janitorship."
