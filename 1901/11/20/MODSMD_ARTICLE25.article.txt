The late Herr Rudolph Kbnig's
great tonometer, for the purchase
of which .Stanford University has
been negotiating for over a year
past, was purchased last week
for the Physics department here
through Professor Sanford. The
instrument, which is called by
Science "a monumental piece of
work," consists of nearly four hun
dred accurately adjusted and prop
erly labeled tuning-forks, varying
several inches and even feet in
size. "These are arranged in a
series," says Science, "so that each
will make a delinile and small
number of beats with the preceding
and following ones, so that the
frequency of any source of sound
approximately simple can at once
be ascertained by direct com
parison. The range extends through
all the tones ordinarily employed
in music." The cost of the instru
ment is about ten thousand dollars.
It is now at Kbeing's old home in
Paris.
Herr Konig was perhaps the
greatest acoustician and nuvnu

fftcturer of acoustic instruments in
the world, and his tuning-forks
especially have always been recog
nized as standard by scientific
men in the United States and
Europe. He was also an original
and patient investigator in physics.
Even during the most successful
years of his life, Herr Konig was
poor, and he had attempted sev
eral times to sell his tonometer to
Stanford University. The coinci
dence of Mrs. Stanford's return
and the great scientist's death
made the purchase possible.
