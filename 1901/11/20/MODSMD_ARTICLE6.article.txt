# Professor Brown's Art Exhibit.

### 
lii the Art studios back of the
Engineering buildings is mi exhibi
tion of paintings by Professor Bol
ton Coit Brown, which is well worth
a visit.
Upon the wall of the westernmost
of the studios we discover some re
cent canvases by Professor Brown.
They come and go, but at present
eight or ten are there.
In several of the landscapes a
realization of the character of out
door light and color is secured by
a more or â€¢ less impressionistic
handling. Others, however, are
painted without the aid of broken
brushwork and analyzed tints.
The glare of California sunshine is
shown in a study of the Camp and
in a bit of the county road seen
with the morning haze still in the
air. In these, the color, analyzed
into almost primary tints, conveys
with special success the flicker and
gleam of visions flooded with the
dazzle of strong light. A road
winding among lovely bills is
similarly handled, though lower in
key, richer in color-harmony and
more agreeable in subject. In a
very impressive study of moun
tains, sombre under a fine mass of
clouds, the painting is vigorous
and not in the impressionistic man
ner. It admirably expresses the
anatomy of the long rocky slopes
and their grave beauty.
The portraits represent almost
the oilier extreme of artistic effort,
representing in low tones effects of
very quiet light. The aim has
been to convey the charm of deli
cate color harmony and subtle
light-gradations. The painting
is done in thin films and the tech
nique quite subordinated to the
strong feeling for the dignity of the
human head.
Also, after seeing in exhibition
after exhibition the narrow bounds
within which many painters are
confined, you are impressed, even
in these few canvases, by a variety
in subject and handling that indi
cates a catholic taste, a constant
growing and developing, a reacting
out towards many kinds of beauty,
and finding ways to express it.
It is not too much to say that
these are big-spirited, forceful, and i
charming pieces of painting.
