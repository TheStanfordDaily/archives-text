# ON STUDENT LABOR.
## Y.M.C.A. Employment Bureau Will Publish Valuable Statistics. 
### 
The Student's Employment Bu
reau of the Young Men's Christian
Association has in hand the prep
aration of a little pamphlet for the
use of self-supporting students.
The purpose of the pamphlet will
he to inform young men and women
who are ambitious for a university
education of the possibilities of
working their way through Stan
ford. The experience of the em
ployment Bureau for live years is
that the field for student labor has
at several seasons during the year
been decidedly in need of more
students in search of work. Es
pecially is this the case in regard
to the demand for women students
to do domestic work. On the other
hand there are many graduates of
preparatory schools who would
gladly enter the University if they
could lie assured of any definite
means of support.
The first purpose of the little
booklet will be, then, to inform
these young men and women who
have good health, ability, and am
bition, of the opportunity awaiting
them here at the University, it is
planned also to make the little
pamphlet a manual in the hands
of the student who undertakes his
own support. It will tell him what
to do when he arrives. It will give
him a great number of suggestive
and valuable hints gleaned from
the experience of scores of men and
women in the student labor field,
thereby enabling him to adapt
himself more perfectly to the con
ditions here, and to make his work
successful.
The booklet will be given con
siderable tone and dignity by a
possible introductory note written
by Dr. Jordan. A true story re
lating the experiences of some
young man, and the experience of
some young lady, added to the
more serious material, will give
color and literary interest to the
little work.
11. F. Coolidge, whose familiarity
in the field of student labor and
whose literary ability especially
qualify him for this work, has
taken largely into his charge the
compilation of statistics. Miss K.
11. Kipp will have charge of these
portions relating especially to
women's work. It is not decided
yet whether it will he appended to
the association hand-book or
printed separately. It will at
least not be published until late
next semester.
This scheme of thus assisting
self-supporting students is new to
student employment bureau work.
It is fitting that Stanford should
take the lead in tins, since she has
exceptional opportunities for work
ing students.
