Mists (Jnice Hoggs of Berkeley
lectured yesterday before the
women of the University on the
Student Volunteer movement. She
talked concerning the work of the
movement about the bay and at
Berkeley, which is in the interest of
procuring volunteers for foreign

missionary work. Miss Hoggs'
speech was largely in the nature of
an appeal to the students here.
There are seventeen volunteers at
the University of California and
but three at Stanford.
A Mission Study class will be
organized at Stanford early next
semester. The course will be under
the charge of Miss Mary Bartruff,
'04, and A. Hull, '03, with whom
all interested in the above work
should confer. The details of the
course will be given later.
