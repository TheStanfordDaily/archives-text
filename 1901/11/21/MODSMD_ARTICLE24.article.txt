# Not on Exhibit.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Will you kindly permit nie to
correct a false impression, derivable
from the title and first paragraph
of the article about my pictures
yesterday. 1 refer to the word "ex
hibit." This it in no sense is.
There are simply a few canvases
for my students to see. The public
is quite welcome to see also, but
they must not expect an "exhibi
tion." B. C. Bkown.
