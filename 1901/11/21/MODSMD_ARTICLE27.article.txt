—Pennsylvania has introduced
a decided innovation in football j
this year, in the shape of the boom
erang kick. It is used only in the

placed end-wise the ball is placed
side-wise; not horizontally, but
obliquely. When kicked it pur
sues a curved course very hard to
judge. It twists like a veritable
boomerang and is very difficult to
catch without a fumble, thus giving
the ends time to get down the
field. —Minnesota Daily.
