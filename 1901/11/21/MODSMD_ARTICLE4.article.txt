# Baseball Diamond.
## 
### 
Until the surveying of the rail
road spur across the old haseball
diamond, it had been planned to
use if this semester. The diamond
on the oval was arranged last year
for the convenience of Dr. Murphy
in coaching both baseball and track
teams, but it was a failure. Con
testing teams refuse to play on it,

as it spoils the hack-field work.
Moreover, the fall work on the oval
interferes with tlie men training on
the track. Manager Edwards and
Captain Cowden recognizing these
faults, had decided to make use of
the old diamond again, to put it in
excellent shape, and to erect some
bleachers. It is the hest and prac
tically the only place for a good di
amond on the campus. It is well
tiled and therefore usually dry and
in excellent shape. Besides, it is
handy for all the students.
The explanation given for trans
planting the railway track is that
it is in the way of the building soon
to he erected on the southeast cor
ner of the quadrangle.
