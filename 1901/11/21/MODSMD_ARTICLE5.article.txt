# Gymnasium Club Exhibition.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Gymnasium
Club last evening it was decided to
postpone the formal "at home"
until April next. Instead, the
doors will he open to the public at
a regular rehearsal on Saturday
night, the 7th of December. The
finals of the wrestling and hand
ball tournaments will be run off
and a series of gymnasium "stunts"
on the most important pieces of
apparatus will complete the pro
gram. Every one interested in the
work is welcome.
