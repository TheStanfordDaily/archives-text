# "PIRATES OF PENZANCE."
## Opera Which Will be Given by the Associated Students in February. 
### 
The opera "Pirates of Penzance"
will lie given by the Associated
Students, under the direction of
Mr. Weer of l'alo Alto, early next
February. The cast will be made
up of students of the University
and people of Palo Alto. There
will be fourteen pieces in the or
chestra, seventy people in the
chorus, and ten principals,making,
with Mr. Weer and the stage man
ager, ninety-six in all. Special
scenery and costumes will be had
from Situ Francisco. The opera is
the most popular of Gilbert and
Sullivan's. There are great op
portunities for male chorus work.
The first rehearsal will take place
tonight. The opera requires most
exacting and careful application
and those who will take part ex
pect to putin a great deal of hard
work. On account of the pressure
of University work for the rest of
this semester, work will be light,
but next semester rehearsals will
proceed vigorously up to the pre
sentation of the opera.
The following is the comment of
the Record-Union of Sacramento on
the amateur performance of this
opera given in that city in Janu
ary, 1900, under Mr. Weer's di
rection :
"The Sacramento Operatic So
ciety sang the 'Pirates of Pen
zance' at the opera house last
evening to a good audience. The
entertainment was under the au
spices of the Native Sons of the
Golden West. The musical satire
was well mounted and costumed.
It is simple justice to say that it
was well presented in all respects.
We have had no amateur perform
ance in many years equal to it.
The chorus work was especially
worthy of commendation. It is
one of the largest choruses that
ever occupied the opera house
stage, and there have been many.
It was a well balanced chorus, too;
just a little weak in contralto
volume, perhaps, but not to a
marked extent. The direction of
Mr. Weer was superior. Evidently
he has given that body of singers
such drill work and exacting prac
tice in rehearsal as its members
never before experienced. In the
director's box be identified himself
with every part —was at once
prompter and director, and kept
the very large body of singers in
constant touch with his own spirit
and enthusiasm, and enthusiasm
that became a little too manifest at
times. But it was excellent direc
tion. The orchestration was not
ably good. For once we have had
a local orchestra with sufficient
stringed instruments and handled
by men who understood what is re
quired of them."
