# FIELD DAY-TOMORROW.
## First Event of the Year for Track Men Will Take Place in the Afternoon. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the handi
cap field-day will be held on the
oval, commencing at 2 o'clock sharp
instead of at 2:30 as formerly an
nounced. No admission will be
charged and a large number of
spectators should assemble to watch
the men perform.
Each event promises to be closely
contested. "Dad" Moulton and
Captain McCaughern, having
watched the men in their work,
will have the handicaps arranged
with the intention of making every
event come out us near a tie as pos
sible.
The regular schedule of track
events will be changed so that each
one is shortened by one-fourth, on
the theory that the men are not,
as yet, fully enough trained to en
dure the strain of the entire dis
tance. A large number of entries
have been made; hitherto such a
number of candidates have seldom
appeared even in the spring se
mester and that so many should
enter, in this try-out points to a
successful year on the track. All
"Dad" asks is that he may have
plenty of men who are willing to
keep training rules and follow his
directions, and, judging from his
past record, we may safely say if
our trainer does not produce some
record-breakers it will be simply
because they are not there. So far
"Dad" seems to be well pleased
with his material. He has already
"spotted" some winners from
among the freshmen and expects
to make "crack-a-jacks" out of men
who have hitherto been but medi
ocre.
Tomorrow's field-day will give a
fair opportunity for all to size up
some of these men, and in a way, to
get a line on the team that will
meet Berkeley next April. The
