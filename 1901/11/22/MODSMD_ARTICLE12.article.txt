Considerable discussion has been
aroused by the action of the faculty
committee in adopting resolutions
affecting participation of students
in undergraduate affairs. Students
are inclined to look upon them as
unfair measures, which limit in
some ways our student body ac
tivities. A student prominent in
athletics, but who is found deficient
in his studies, will not only be de
barred from all University work
for one semester, but by the new
ruling will be prohibited from
taking any part in athletic activ
ities as well as other student body
enterprises for an additional period
of one semester. This makes the
penalty for deficiency in scholar
ship much more severe.
On the other hand, in that these
new rules will have a decided
effect on the standard of work done
by .students who take part in these
enterprises, they are commendable.
Two warnings will be given be
fore any student is suspended.
Heretofore suspension came with
out any satisfactory warning, which
placed doubtful students at a great
disadvantage. Hereafter that stu
dent who fails to show improve
ment in his work, after being ofli
cially informed that it is unsatis
factory, will be given a second
chance for attaining the stand
ard. If he fails to take advantage
of this second warning the inevit
able will occur. The new rules are
more just to all concerned for the
reason that students will be given
a fair chance to maintain that
standard of scholarship which our

faculty deems necessary to the dig
nity of the University.
