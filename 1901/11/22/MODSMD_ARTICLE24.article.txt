### 
The Stanford University Sym
phony Orchestra is planning to
give its regular concert about l)e
cember 14th. The Orchestra has
been doing excellent work this se
mester under the direction of
Professor Young, who was instru
mental in bringing the Royal Ital
ian Band here. One concert will
he given this semester and probably
two in the next. It is hoped to he
able to give an entertainment in
San Jose or San Francisco, but this
will depend upon the work done
and upon the number of players

who turn out. Brass and wind
instruments are especially desired.
The rehearsals take place Thurs
day evenings at 7:30 p.m. in the
chapel.
The Orchestra receives no sup
port from the student body fund,
as is the case with other student
organizations, and therefore when
it gives a concert it should be well
patronized. Last year at the con
cert there was such a small audi
ence that the expenses were not
realized. It is to be hoped that
this will not occur again.
