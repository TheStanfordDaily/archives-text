Ralph Fisher moved that the
right to vote for football captain be
restricted to those men who won a
sweater in the previous intercol
legiate game. The motion was
unanimously passed.
A motion to the effect that the
captain for following year be elected
immediately after the game with
California was lost. It was feared
that such a measure would encour
age the use of politics before the
game, that it would cause discus
sion among the players, and beside
it was thought that there would be
no convenient time or place to hold
an election after the game.
Dr. Angell explained the sig
nificance of the new resolutions
passed by the faculty committee.
Burt Gildersleeve was elected
alternate member of the Inter
collegiate Athletic Committee,
which is now composed of Dave
Brown, C. A. Cant well, and Ralph
Fisher, who were elected in Sep
tember.
