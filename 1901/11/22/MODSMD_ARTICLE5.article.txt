# JUNIOR ASSESSMENT.
## Class of 1903 Levies $3.00 on Each Member to Meet Expenses of "Quad" Photos. 
### 
At a meeting of the Junior class
this afternoon a Quad assessment
of $3 was unanimously voted by
those present. This assessment
will partially defray the expense
of having individual pictures of
those who affiliate with the class of
1903.
The business manager of the
Quad, Chester Naramore, will be
in room 10 on Monday from 1 to 2
p.m. and on Tuesday from 1 until
2:30, to collect the assessments and
to give each student paying such
assessment an order on the pho
tographer permitting him to have
a negative made.
in the past Juniors have often
been unable to obtain copies of the
Quad because of the limited num
ber printed. To avoid this it has
been decided that those Juniors
wishing Annuals this year shall
leave orders with the business man
ager at the time of paying their
dues, in order to be sure of obtain
taining them. There are a large
number of pictures to be taken,and
the time is limited ns they must be
in early in order that they may be
sent East to have the cuts made.
It is important, therefore, to get
the photos immediately so that if
they are unsatisfactory there will
be an opportunity for resitting.
The Quad is well under way.
Editor Renaud and Manager Nara
more worked on it all summer and
now much of the literary part is
completed and the art work is rap
idly progressing. The photographs
are practically the only remaining
feature of the book to be completed.
It is expected that the Quad will
be out earlier than usual.
