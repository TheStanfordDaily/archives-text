## Final Contest of the Debating League of California Next January. 
### 
President McCormick r>f tlie Htu
tlenl body has received a letter
from \V. Herbert Graham, general
secretary of the Debating League
of California, stating that January
18th has been set as the date for
the final debate of the series held
by the league, which is to take
place at Stanford. It will be re
called that the Executive Commit
tee last year voted to give a cup to
the school first winning three of
the contests conducted under the
organization, provided the final de
bate should be held at the Univer
sity. Last spring the first debate
after the offer had been made took
place in San Francisco because the
schedule conflicted with dates al
ready arranged here. It was won
by the Humboldt evening high
school of San Francisco, which
holds the cup and will compete in
January with the Lodi high school.
The League comprises most of the
high schools in this part of the
state, and the final annual contest
is between the two which made the
best showing in the preliminary
meets of the schedule.
Following is the letter from the
secretary:
Oakland, Cal , Nov. 17, 1901.
The President of Student Body,
Stanford University, Palo Alto,
Cal.
Dear Sik: It is with pleasure
that 1 am able to inform you that
the second final tournament debate
of this League, between Lodi high
school and Humboldt evening
high school of San Francisco, has
been set for January 18th, 1901.
Although it is rather tardy in get
ting to this point 1 am sure it will
make up for this in its brightness
and spirit.
By virtue of certain legislation
regarding this debate three Stan
ford professors are asked to offici
ate as judges, to be selected by your
hotly in regard to their especial
firmness.
Any arrangements which you
desire to be carried out to the end
of arranging this debate or any
information desired, address me
and I will see that any such mat
ter will be promptly carried out.
Yours sincerely,
\V. Herbert Gha ham,
Gen. Sec. D. L. C.
