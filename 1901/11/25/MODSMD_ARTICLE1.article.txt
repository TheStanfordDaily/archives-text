# SATISFACTORY MEET.
## Freshmen Turned Out Especially Well for the Handicap Field-Day Saturday. 
### 
The showing of the men in the
handicap field-day on Saturday
was highly satisfactory, consider
ing the time of year and the in
experience of most of the perform
ers. There were, however, some
features which must inevitably he
a source of regret both to the
trainer and the men, namely, the
lack of attendance on the part of
the student body and the failure of
the old men to turn out for their
events.
From these first performances of
the season, however, we nifty feel
assured that Berkeley will have
no walk-over next April, though as
yet we are woefully weak in the
distances. The sprints were well
contested, Kehrlein, Kitching,
Lyons, Stevens, Luce, and Mc-
Caughern showing up well. The
gamiest nice of the day was won by
"Tommy" McCaughern. In the
first heat of the 150, which he won
by a few inches, he started from
scratch, was boxed twice in the
distance, the last time being within
twenty yards of the tape. Tommy
startß fast and runs in good form.
Crossman and Sevier, who got first
and second places in the 300, both
ran well though neither had ever
before entered a field-day. Cross
man has a long, easy stride, and
Sevier seems to be a natural run
ner.
E. C. Beach entered in the
hurdles, the 75-yard dash, and in
the pole-vault, doing some good
work. Bell, Reed, Moran, Dole,
and Hopper showed capability as
all-round athletes, Bell winning a
place in the finals of the 75-yard
dash, first place in the pole-vault,
and second in the high jump.
Whitaker, coming from Columbia,
cleared 10 feet in the pole-vault in
good form, and Harper, from the
University of Washington, ran a
good strong race in the 1100, finish
ing close to Swinerton and Mc-
Laughlin, who had a 40-yard
handicap. Both Swinerton and
McLaughlin have it in them to
make good distance men. Hosmer
won the lugh jump by his handi
cap, as did Bell in the pole-vault.
Among the old men who entered
were Holman, who won first in his
trial heat in the 150 and also in
the final heat; Lyons, who did the
same in the 75-yard dash and took
first place in the broad-jump at
20:4; Taylor, Naramore, and Kuhn
in the hurdles; Nangle, in the dis
tance; Naramore, in the broad
jump; Parker, Hyde, Traeger, Haw
ley, and McFadden in the shot
put; and Nichols in the hammer
throw.
Taylor and Kuhn both did well
in the hurdles, Kuhn leaving the
mark much better than last year.
Hyde and Traeger did good work
in the shot-put, though both
showed considerable deficiency in
form. At present we practically
have no one in the hammer-throw.
Brooke, who got second place last
year, will be back next semester,
and ought to throw something over
140 feet.
The most hopeful signs are in

the readiness with which the fresh
men enter into the work. What
ever may be the result this year, it
promises great things for the fut
ure. If the same willingness con
tinues, as it will if it meets with
the proper amount of student body
enthusiasm, we shall have a suc
cessful season on the track.
"Dad" Moulton and Captain
McCaughern are satisfied with the
result of the fall training, an inno
vation at Stanford which must in
the future become a custom if we
expect to compete favorably with
other universities.

Among the old men who entered
were Holman, who won first in his
trial heat in the 150 and also in
the final heat; Lyons, who did the
same in the 75-yard dash and took
first place in the broad-jump at
20:4; Taylor, Naramore, and Kuhn
in the hurdles; Nangle, in the dis
tance; Naramore, in the broad
jump; Parker, Hyde, Traeger, Haw
ley, and McFadden in the shot
put; and Nichols in the hammer
throw.
Taylor and Kuhn both did well
in the hurdles, Kuhn leaving the
mark much better than last year.
Hyde and Traeger did good work
in the shot-put, though both
showed considerable deficiency in
form. At present we practically
have no one in the hammer-throw.
Brooke, who got second place last
year, will be back next semester,
and ought to throw something over
140 feet.
The most hopeful signs are in

the readiness with which the fresh
men enter into the work. What
ever may be the result this year, it
promises great things for the fut
ure. If the same willingness con
tinues, as it will if it meets with
the proper amount of student body
enthusiasm, we shall have a suc
cessful season on the track.
"Dad" Moulton and Captain
McCaughern are satisfied with the
result of the fall training, an inno
vation at Stanford which must in
the future become a custom if we
expect to compete favorably with
other universities.

The showing of the men in the
handicap field-day on Saturday
was highly satisfactory, consider
ing the time of year and the in
experience of most of the perform
ers. There were, however, some
features which must inevitably he
a source of regret both to the
trainer and the men, namely, the
lack of attendance on the part of
the student body and the failure of
the old men to turn out for their
events.
From these first performances of
the season, however, we nifty feel
assured that Berkeley will have
no walk-over next April, though as
yet we are woefully weak in the
distances. The sprints were well
contested, Kehrlein, Kitching,
Lyons, Stevens, Luce, and Mc-
Caughern showing up well. The
gamiest nice of the day was won by
"Tommy" McCaughern. In the
first heat of the 150, which he won
by a few inches, he started from
scratch, was boxed twice in the
distance, the last time being within
twenty yards of the tape. Tommy
startß fast and runs in good form.
Crossman and Sevier, who got first
and second places in the 300, both
ran well though neither had ever
before entered a field-day. Cross
man has a long, easy stride, and
Sevier seems to be a natural run
ner.
E. C. Beach entered in the
hurdles, the 75-yard dash, and in
the pole-vault, doing some good
work. Bell, Reed, Moran, Dole,
and Hopper showed capability as
all-round athletes, Bell winning a
place in the finals of the 75-yard
dash, first place in the pole-vault,
and second in the high jump.
Whitaker, coming from Columbia,
cleared 10 feet in the pole-vault in
good form, and Harper, from the
University of Washington, ran a
good strong race in the 1100, finish
ing close to Swinerton and Mc-
Laughlin, who had a 40-yard
handicap. Both Swinerton and
McLaughlin have it in them to
make good distance men. Hosmer
won the lugh jump by his handi
cap, as did Bell in the pole-vault.
