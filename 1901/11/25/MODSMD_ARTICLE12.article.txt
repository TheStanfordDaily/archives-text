The climax of the season's foot
ball games in the East was reached
last Saturday when Harvard in

was altogether outclassed, in buck
ing, running, tackling, and punting.
The score was 22-0, two touch
downs, two goals, and a field-goal
in the first half, and a touchdown
in the second. Thirty-six thous

That there are other good
teams is proved by the wonderful
record of the Michigan team this
year and their last score of 89-0
