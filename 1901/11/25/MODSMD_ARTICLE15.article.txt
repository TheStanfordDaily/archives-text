# Success of Wallace A. Irwin.
## 
### 
Wallace A. Irwin, ex-'O3, spent
yesterday on the campus. Mr.
Irwin was prominent in literary
circles during his undergraduate
days, and since leaving the Univer
sity has won distinct literary fame.
He is at present editor of the San
Francisco News Letter and does a
great deal of special work for the
Examiner. Mr. Irwin is just now
receiving flattering press notices
ahout his new hook, called "The
Love Sonnets of a Hoodlum,"
which is just out- It, is a collec
tion of slang in verse. The San
Francisco Chronicle printed a long
review in yesterday's issue, together
with a picture of the author. In
commenting on the work, the
writer in tin? Chronicle ranks Mr.
Irwin with Townsend, author of
"Chimmie Fadden," and George
Ade,author of "Fables in Slang,"
a sa master of slang. The Call, Bul
letin and of Chronicle yesterday also,
published reviews of the new book
and photographs of Mr. Irwin.
