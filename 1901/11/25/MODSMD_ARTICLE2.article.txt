# DEUTSCHER LIEDERABEND.
## Frau Schumann-Heinck and Mr. Bispham Give Most Delightful Concert. 
### 
The largest a ml most appreciative
audience ever witnessed at the Uni
versity filled Assembly Hall last
Friday evening to listen to a con
cert such as is rarely given outside
of New York, Boston, and a few
other American cities. That Stan
ford University has been able to
attract a singer of international
reputation like Frau Schumann-
Heinck and an artist like Mr.
Bispham is a fact which causes us
to feel just pride.
The program, which had been
arranged with fine artistic taste,
opened with Chopin's Fantasie,
op. 49. In the interpretation of
this most difficult composition,
with its hidden rhythmatic charms
and its exquisite poetic beauty,
Mr. Fickenscher showed all the
qualities of his excellent playing,
which his hearers at Stanford have
admired for many years: his truly
musical conception, his beautiful
touch, and his never-failing perfect
technique.
Mr. David Bispham followed
with Tannhiiuser's Busslied, an
interesting song from the thirteenth
century: a charming song from
Bach's famous "Coffee Cantata;"
and Beethoven's magnificent " Die
Himmel riihmen." With the ex
ception of certain nasal tones which
at times were noticeable, his sing
ing was most pleasing throughout,
and well deserving of the great ap
plause with which the audience re
warded him. He seemed to us es
pecially successful in the Bach
song and, at the close of the pro
gram, in Schubert's "Der Linden
baum," and in the ballad "Ed
ward," although in the latter song
he did not quite rise to tiie great
dramatic force of the text.
The chief honors of the evening
were, however, carried off by Frau
Schumann-Heinck, her [(leasing
appearance and her winning,
charming manners making her at
once the favorite of the audience.
It is needless to say anything of
the art of a singer who is recog
nized as the greatest living con
tralto by all competent critics and
who has been decorated by almost
every crowned head of Europe.
Her singing of Schubert's great
song " Allniacht," the charming
" Wohin ? " the beautiful Brahms'
songs, and Liszt's highly dramatic
" Die drei Zigeuner" will be forever
remembered by those who heard
it. She was called out again
and again, and three times in suc
cession she responded most gra
ciously with an encore, the most
beautiful of which was the last, the
little slumbering "Strampelchen,"
which she sang with inimitable
grace of expression.
We believe that we are speaking
for everyone who was present if we
express our deep-felt gratitude to
the great artists who gave us such
a beautiful evening.
