Saturday afternoon the San
Francisco Bulletin published the
following article on its sporting
page:
The controversy raised by Coach
Fickert of Stanford after the Cali
fornia-Stanford football game has
not yet died out. He said that
California won because John Horan
had given the Stanford signals to
the U. C. players, thus enabling
California to stop all the Cardinal
team's plays. Of course, Coaches
Simpson and Hopper and the Blue
and Gold boys denied this em
phatically. The two college papers,
namely, the Daily Californian and
the Daily Palo Alto, took the
matter np and for the last two
weeks have been devoting their
editorial columns to the subject,
and what with argument and
abuse of the other fellow they have
been having a merry time of it.
Yesterday Captain Lloyd A.
Womble and Coach Hopper of
California went to a notary public
and swore out an affidavit to the
effect that they knew nothing
whatever of the Stanford signals
either before or after the game.
Coach Simpson has not signed this
because he is in the East watching
the football games of the "Big
Four." He will sign it when he
returns.
Captain Womble said afterwards
that if Mr. Fickert was a gentle
man be would either prove his as
sertion or apologize for it. He also
said that the fact that Horan tried
both universities and then went to
California merely proves that the
idea that U. C. was a superior col
lege to Stanford was in bis mind
and not that he was paid to do it.
Altogether the evidence in favor
of the Stanford coach's assertion is
very slight, and it seems more like
the talk of a disappointed man
than anything else. The fact that
many of the Stanford students and
the paper of the college have taken
up the matter as an excuse for
being beaten by a lighter team
goes to show that Stanford cannot
take an unexpected beating grace
fuHy.
