# Spoke on Eye-Strain.

### 
Fayette Birtch, '02, gave an en
tertaining report before Education
1 Friday morning on "The Eye-
Strain of the Children in the Public

School of Palo Alto." Lust May
Birtch made individual tests on
the eye-strain of the pupils. His
results showed that if the tests in
other communities agree with these,
eye-strain increases with the cur
riculum, greater in hoys than in
girls, and that eye-strain goes hand
in hand with poor scholarship. He
then showed the great difficulty in
experience in making these tests
by the ordinary school teacher; but
proved that good work could be
done in other branches by making
tests on other of the special sense
organs, and concluded by showing
the old watch test to be a farce.
This was demonstrated by holding
a watch up before the class, includ
ing the professor, and two-thirds of
the class pretended to hear the
ticking. Birtch calmly announced
that the watch had not been run
ning for two weeks.
