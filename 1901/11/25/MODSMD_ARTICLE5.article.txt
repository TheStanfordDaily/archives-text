# The Los Angeles Game.
## 
### 
The football team, fifteen men in
all, will leave tomorrow afternoon
on the 3:01 train to take the "Owl"
from San Francisco for Los Ange
les. The team lined up for signal
practice several times last week,
and will do so again tomorrow
morning and also on Wednesday
in Los Angeles. The men will go
into the game practically as they
did against Berkeley, with the ex
ception of Bansbach at quarter in
stead of Baitt, and possibly a man
in place of Clark, who lias a bad
knee. While in Los Angeles the
team will put up at the Westmin
ster Hotel. They will play an all-
Los Angeles eleven at Fiesta Park
on Thanksgiving day, and proba
bly a game with Pomona College at
San Bernardino on the Saturday
following. Manager Edwards went
to Los Angeles on Sunday with the
intention of arranging for the latter
game, but up to the present time
has sent no word to Captain Fisher
concerning it.
