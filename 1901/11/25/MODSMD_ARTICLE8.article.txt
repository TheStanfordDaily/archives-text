The two college dailies had con
sidered the unpleasant difficulty
and misunderstanding arising be
tween their respective universities
after the intercollegiate game satis
factorily explained and settled.
But the Bulletin continues to agi
tate the controversy. The article
quoted in this issue was written by
a person either ignorant of the true
sentiment and attitude of the Stan
ford student body or determined to
injure that organization by giving
the reading public the impression
that it is composed of men and
women unable to gracefully accept
a defeat. \Ve suspect the author
is a Berkeley sympathizer who
takes this opportunity of casting un
fair reflections at a rival institution.
Although be may be ignorant of
the true situation, he is just as
guilty of unfairness. Neither the
students of Stanford nor their col
lege Â«I;iily have sought for excuses
to explain their defeat. The ma
jority of the students, as well as
their college sheet, have frankly
acknowledged California a fair vic
tory. The Bulletin displays its
ability of inventing facts to support
a sensation.
