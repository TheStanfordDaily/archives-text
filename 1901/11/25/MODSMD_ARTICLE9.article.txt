Much has been written and more
has been said during the past year
for the purpose t>f injuring the
reputation of Stanford University.
Self-appointed critics stand ready
to seize the slightest hint that will
discredit the institution. We who
are students have declared our al
legiance to the University by ac
cepting the advantages it offers.
Upon us, then, rests the responsibil
ity of showing to the world what

Stanford means. Every man who
goes out as the member of a foot
ball team, as one of the musical
clubs, or as an individual student,
must realize that the searchlight of
criticism will follow his conduct,
and that he has not only the re
sponsibility but the opportunity of
reflecting credit upon the institu
tion which means so much to us
all.
