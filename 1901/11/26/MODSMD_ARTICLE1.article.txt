## Former Treasurer Gives Facts in Opposition to an Athletic Association. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Your paper has advocated the
formation of an Athletic Associa
tion to take the place of the pres
ent Associated Students, and as I
am not able to take part in the
discussions at the University 1
would like to use some of your
space to state a few facts in opposi
tion to the scheme.
The plan of the Athletic Associ
ation is not a new one; it has been
tried before at Stanford, and it was
only after many years of misman
agement that the students were able
to break loose from the Athletic
Association and take things into
their own hands.
That Association had a commit
tee composed of students, alumni,
and faculty men, as has been pro
posed in the present scheme, and
under its management the student
body carried a debt of from three
to six thousand dollars annually.
The student managers mismanaged
and misappropriated the funds of
the Association, and the directing
committee winked at and covered
ii)> the discrepancies.
When Mr. Hoover was elected
the first student body treasurer un
der the present system, the men
who had formerly had their hands
in the student body sack opposed
him, and it was with difficulty that
he was able to establish an honest
and open policy of management.
Too much cannot he said of the
evils of the committee system; con
centration of power in the hands of
a few without responsibility is dan
gerous, — the members of a commit
tee are too easily influenced. The
scheme proposed would destroy the
democratic spirit which now exists
at Stanford; it would place the con
trol of affairs in the hands of a
small clique, and the large body of
students would become disinter
ested in them. Those who are
financially unable to meet the
dues of the Association would be
eliminated, as well as ninety per
cent of the women students, who
would think it anomalous to openly
unite with an Athletic Association.
These are the classes whose influ
ence should be retained in the se
lection of student body officers.
These people who would have no
voice i:i the proposed Association
are the ones who vote the most in
telligently and the most consist
ently in a student body election.
An election before the student
hotly means that a candidate must
stand upon his merits —he must be
honest and capable, and must have
the personal support of at least a.
majority of the students. An elec
tion by it committee of directors
means simply that the candidate
must have a long drag with the
majority of the committee, whose
votes are secured hy promises of
patronage or future support.
lam to imply from what has
been published that this Associa
tion iH to be incorporated. This
would mean that shares of stock
would he sold to the students at
the University and that in three or
four years these shares wtmld be

scattered all over the world, so that
it would he impossible to get a ma
jority of shareholders together for a
meeting.
After six years of the worst of ex
periences, the Athletic Association
was given up as a failure. The
present scheme is the work of some
of the strongest men the student
body has had, and for the students
at this time to turn hack to the
former plan would be very unwise.
Since the adoption of the present
plan of management the heavy
debt has been cleared and the stu
dents have had the experience and
the pleasure of selecting their own
officers. While under the early
system there was frequent misman
agement, I think that with proba
bly one exception the managers
chosen by the student body vote
have been honest and capable men,
who have had the support of the
entire student body, and not merely
of a clique of nine men.
There are many defects in the
present constitution, but these can
he remedied hy amendment or by
the adoption of a new constitution;
it is not necessary to change the
whole system.
