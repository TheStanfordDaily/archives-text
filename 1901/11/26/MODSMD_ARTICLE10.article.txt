Thk arguments of John Nourse
in opposition to the proposed plan
of an athletic association are
clear and well stated. There are
two sides to ever}' question, and it
is only through a careful and un
prejudiced survey of both that a
candid and just solution can he
reached. We have already had
many arguments in favor of the
new scheme. Which are the more
valid, those that have been advo
cated by several experienced and
prominent undergraduates, or those
in opposition by a graduate who
has been active in undergraduate
affairs?
The proposed scheme is evidently
misunderstood by Nourse in one
particular. He says: ''In three
or four years these shares would be
scattered all over the world, so that
it would be impossible to get a
majority of shareholders together
for a meeting." According to the
plan as proposed, however, the
student body would he divided into
districts, according to locality or
association, and these districts
would each have representatives in
the corporation, the number de
pending on the proportionate size
of that district. Whenever a rep
resentative graduated or left the
University his district would elect
his successor, who would continue
as a shareholder in place of his
predecessor. Thus the possibility
of shares being scattered all over
the world in any period of time
would be obviated.
The other arguments of Nourse
admit of satisfactory debate. How

ever, if the scheme is really a bad
one, enough has been said. Until
this has been satisfactorily proven
we will gladly continue to publish
arguments relative to a change
from our present centralized sys
tem of management to that of an
athletic association.
