The total receipts for October of
this year are $700 less than those
of October of 1900. This may he
accounted for by the fact that there
have been no class games played,
and because the schedule of games
for the Varsity and Freshman teams
has been limited. The expense
per day is practically the same as
for the month of October of last
year.
