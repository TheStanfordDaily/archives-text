# Washington Favors Debate.
## 
### 
The Intercollegiate Debating
Committee, through Secretary C. I).
McComish, received yesterday from
the University of Washington a
reply to the proposition for a de
hate submitted by Stanford some
time ago. The northeners look
with favor on a Stanford-Washing
ton contest, as is evidenced hy the
following:
Seattle, Wash., Nov. 20, 1901.
Ciiahi.es D. McComish, Secretary
Intercollegiate Debating Com
mittee, Stanford University.
Dear Sir: Your letter of No
vember 14th is just at hand. In
reply I wish to express our appre
ciation of the proposition you have
made. Whatever brings the two
universities into closer touch is
eagerly welcomed.
In regard to the time of debate,
a date during the first two weeks
of April would suit us.
We have a contract to bring
Oregon here next spring for debate,
and it will he practically impos
sible to support two debates in
Seattle next year. So, with your
consent, Stanford would he the
place.
We are willing to enter into a
contract for one, three, or five years.
We realize that we have a. reputa
tion yet to make, and if for that or
any other reason you may prefer a
one-year contract, all right.
Expenses are understood to in
clude expenses of judges and visit
ing teams, and the usual inciden
tals.
Perhaps, to bring the matter for
ward, it would be well for you to
draw up a contract, tentatively,
and submit it to us. We can then
suggest changes if we see occasion.
Very truly, Howard A. Hanson.
