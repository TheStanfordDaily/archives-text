# The 						Students' Conference.
## 
### 
Every year four students' con
ferences are held in the United
States by the college Young Men's
Christian Associations. The one
for the Pacific Coast occurs every
winter at Pacific Grove, and lasts
ten - days. Attendance on it gives
pleasure and inspiration that are
essential to a complete college
course. All who attend live and
eat at one place, and intimate ac
quaintance is made with men from
all over the country. Last year
one hundred professors and stu
dents from twenty-one different in
stitutions were present.
The mornings are spent in meet
ings, in hearing addresses, in Bible
classes, and in informal gatherings
for the purpose of talking over sub
jects of interest in regard to Asso
ciation work. The afternoons are
entirely given over to athletic
sports of all kinds, picnics, and
general recreation. Series of base
ball games between the various sec
tions, states, and colleges, a tennis
tournament, a track meet, and
other sports will be arranged. The
total expense for the ten days, in
cluding railroad fares to and from
Pacific drove from here, will be
fifteen dollars. The first meal
served will be supper, December
27th. All who wish to attend the
conference may apply to officers of
the Stanford Y. M. C. A. before
December 20th.
