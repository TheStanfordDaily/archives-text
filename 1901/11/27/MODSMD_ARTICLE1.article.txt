# "THE COMING CITY."
## Professor Richard T. Ely Delivers an Address on Municipal Reform. 
### 
Richard T. Ely, professor of
economics at the University of
Wisconsin, arrived at the Univer
sity unexpectedly this morning
from San Francisco. He is visit
ing on the Coast for a* few weeks
but his coining to Stanford today
was unlooked for, and consequently
there was no announcement of his
lecture on the bulletin-board till
late this morning. The chapel was
well filled, however, and an appre
ciative audience listened to a most
interesting address Com
ing City." Professor Ely said:
"The problem of the city is a
problem of the revolution —an in
dustrial revolution. Momentous
changes have come to our country
from the growth and increasing im
portance of cities during the last
few years, and general interest has
been aroused in municipal reform.
There have been many well-meant
attempts to crush corruption in
our big cities, particularly in New
York, but they have been inade
quate and unsuccessful. We have
thought our problem of municipal
reform too easy. Our efforts to
solve it have not been positive
enough. We turn out one set of
rascals from our government only
to place another set of rascals in
power.
"There are three things that we
must realize before we can reform
our city governments: First, that
municipal government is a profes
sion and not a business; second,
that it is a diflicult profession, re
quiring special preparation; third,
that a man should devote his life
to it. Our mayors must have not
only efficiency, honesty, and com
mon sense, which are three pre
requisites to any kind of city gov
ernment, but they should also have
the ability to select subordinates
with the knowledge necessary to
the proper fulfillment of their posi
tions. We must have a class of of
fice-11 older 8.
"The city of the twentieth cen
tury will distinguish between of
fices connected with legislation and
oflices connected with public ad
ministration. We should model
our city government on the German
method of control, which provides
that the term of oflice shall last
from ten to twelve years, and that
mayors should be called from small
towns to large cities, —in short, a
system which unites an effective
system of centralized control with a
large measure of individual liberty.
"Our cities should be like a well
ordered household. They should
appeal not only to the wage earn
ers, but to every class of the popu
lation. We should have a central
ized system of slate control, but it
should not interfere with legitimate
municipal control. I have great
hope for the future of the twenti
eth century city. 1 believe that
municipal reforms will be success
ful, if we only remember that city
government is a profession and not
a business."
