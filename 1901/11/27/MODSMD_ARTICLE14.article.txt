Following is an editorial from
the Michigan Daily News:
From the universities of the Pacific
Coast, Stanford and California,
come complaints about the diffi
culty of securing enough football
men to constitute two elevens. All
this is only another phase of the
old, old task of holding a second
eleven on the field, after the first
few weeks of the year are over, and
the men who will make the varsity
team virtually decided upon. To
the others who realize that, with
the exception of the possibilty of
an accident to a regular player,
there is little chance of their mak
ing the team, slight inducement is
offered for good work and regular
practice It is all important that for
the afternoon practice of the varsity
there must he something offered to
the reserves to encourage them in
devoting several hours every after
noon to hard and tiresome practice.
It, will not do to say that the gen
eral welfare of the university and a
student's loyalty to his institution
should he sufficient inducements.
All this may be a temporary in
spiration, but never a permanent
one. There must be a material ob
ject for which men will exert them
selves, or the best results will not lie
forthcoming. If those institutions
which complains of the lack of foot
ball candidates will take some means
of enlisting interest beyond the gen
eral motive of loyalty to the uni
versity, better results will be sure to
follow.
Michigan is mistaken in respect
to Stanford not having enough
men to constitute two elevens. The
second team men have been too
faithful to admit complaint.
What they do need is recognition
of their services, and it is with this
idea of expressing the gratitude of

the student body and at the same
time enlisting interest for the
future that the management in
tends sending the second team on a
Christmas vacation trips.
