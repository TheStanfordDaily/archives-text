The following editorial appeared
in the Daily Califomian of Novem
ber 23d:
''It has long been a matter of re
gret in California that boating can
not be included in the list of
intercollegiate contests. The time
must come, however, when boating
will occupy the same position on
the Pacific Coast as it does in the
East. When that time comes the
present Boating Club will have
dene much to assure success and
victory to California. The work of
the Boating Club at the present
time cannot have the same interest
to the student body or the mem
bers of the Boating Club which the
sport would have if a contest with
Stanford could be arranged. The
least which the students of Califor
nia can do is to encourage by their
presence the pioneer efforts of the
Boating Club."
