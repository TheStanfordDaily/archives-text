J. F. English has received an in
teresting letter from W. M. Erb,
'01, who is studying law at Colum
bia. Speaking of the Stanford
dinner in New York on the evening
of the game, November 9th, he
Bays:
" The result of the game was an
awful blow to the fellows here.
We got it ten minutes after the
game was over, but kept it away
from the gang until 9:80. When 1
announced the score a quiet fell
over the table like that which set
tles over the field before the kick
off. In those twenty seconds, in
which you could hear the breathing
of those near you, not a word was
spoken, but with a complete right
about, the tone of the evening
changed. Before, all was happy;
and after, all was disappointment.
I wish I had time to point out the
full meaning of the change. 1
merely suggest. The old-timers
sunk deeper into their belief and
said nothing. I could see it was
the last straw. The intermediates
said nothing, but smiled and wished
for one more chance. We of the
later days swore in good
Saxon. It was a great disappoint
ment."
In another part of the letter
" Billy " remarks that, from what
he can see, Stanford is-the "great
est place on earth." He now has a
position us assistant librarian in
the library of the New York Acad
emy of Sciences.
