Editor Daily Pai.o Alto:
In looking over the lint of names
of those who accepted the invita
tion to sing in the opera "The Pi
rates of Penzance" I found that a
very small number were from the
campus, and perhaps it may he well
for me to make clear my position
in the matter.
Hy lists handed me by my
pupils and a few others, one hun
dred invitations were issued, hut 1
am not sufficiently acquainted
among the University students to
know whether all who wish to ex
tend their aid have been reached. I
take this opportunity, therefore, of
extending to all a most cordial
invitation to join me in endeavor
ing to make the opera a success
and a credit to the musical people
of the UDiversity.
The next rehearsal is to be held
next Friday evening, November
28th, in Nortree Hall, Palo Alto.
All rehearsals will commence at
7:30 o'clock and will close at
sharp. Very truly yours,
Louis Wm. W'kku.
