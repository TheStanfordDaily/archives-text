The English Club held a most
enjoyable meeting last evening at
the Delta Gamma house. Literary
charades were given under the
direction of Miss Pearson, bringing
forth some very clever burlesque
acting by Jack Bonnell, '02; Fred
Fowler, "04; Miss Christabel Sobey,
'(>1; and Miss Harriett Brown, '02.
Every charade was heartily ap
plauded and the performers were
given a number of curtain calls.
Though almost impromptu, the
entertainment was one of the most
thoroughly enjoyable yet provided
by the club. Vocal selections were
given by Miss Edythe Ellerbeck
and Miss Vivian Bailey, accom
panied by Miss May Hurl hurt, and
a number of humorous recitations
were rendered by Lee Emerson
Bassett.
The executive committee an
nounced the election to member
ship of Miss May Lucille Caldwell,
Miss Helen Lathrop, and Miss
Pearl Green.
