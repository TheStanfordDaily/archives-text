Coach Swindells and Captain
Cowilen had about a score of base
ball cranks out for last night's
practice on the diamond, and they
kept their men chasing warm
grounders and llies for about an
hour. Parker warmed up his
Varsity arm by a little brisk pitch
ing to Knight's mitten, and twisted
in a few curves in a way which
showed he had not quite forgotten
the knack. McFarland, '05, who
seems to be Parker's closest rival,
did not putin an appearance; he
is easily seen, however, to be an
excellent twirler, full of life and
ambition, with a good, clear head,
and a number of very fair curves.
Stillinan sported his Portland Ath
letic Club uniform at the plate,
stopping the throws to home for
the coach's and the captain's bats.
Stillinan will, when he has
smoothed down the rough edges of
his work, prove one of the most
promising freshman players. Blake
was putin on first base for awhile,
and showed fair form. Brown, \V.
\V. Copp, and Crawford covered
the other two bases and short-stop,
and all did fair work. Brown, who
is a senior and has played two
years on the Varsity team, shows
what is perhaps the best form yet
displayed in the infield, being
quick and sure in his catching and
throws. In the outfield were Luce,
'04, McKenna, '05, Bartell, '05,
Spivalo, '05, Ballagh, '1)4, Scales,
'05, Young, '02, and Lock wood,'o4.
