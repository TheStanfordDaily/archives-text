# STANFORD WINS IN THE SOUTH.
## Defeats All-Southern-California Team, 12-0, and Perris Indians, 23-0. 
### 
The fifteen men who represented
Stanford in the two football games
in Southern California,played dur
ing the Thanksgiving vacation, re
turned to the University today
after an absence of six days. They
played an all-Southern-California
aggregation of players captained
by Phil Wilson, ex-'Ol, Thursday,
defeating it by a score of 12-0.
Saturday they met the plucky rep
resentatives of the Perris Indian
School, whom they easily defeated
by a score of 23-0. Following are
accounts of both games:
12-0 Game.
The game between Stanford and
the team representing all Southern
California was a great success. Two
hours before the game was sched
uled the crowd began to straggle in
to Fiesta Park, and at two forty
five, when the game waH called,
ever} 7 seat was taken Although a
large football game is a new thing
for Los Angeles, the people entered
into the spirit of the game to the
best of their knowledge and ability.
Most of the younger element came
decked out in colors and, although
the black and gold of the local team
naturally predominated, the cardi
nal of the sturdy visitors was much
in evidence.
The yelling was peculiar. There
was very little attempt at organiza
tion, and each individual formu
lated and delivered his own yells.
About a third of the spectators had
evidently never seen a football
game before. Whenever a Southern
man was tackled particularly hard
by a Standfordite, the crowd would
yell foul and storm around as if
some terrible error of football
etiquette had been committed.
Stanford was first on the field
and, after running through a few
plays, gave way to the All-Southern-
Californias. Both teams were
greeted with cheering. Stanford
took the north side of the field and
Southern Calif >rnia the south. The
teams appeared to be about the
same weight,although Stanford was
a trifle heavier. The Southern
Califomias kicked off to Stanford's
20-yard line, Hill returning the
ball 10 yards. On the first line-up
Hill punted 25 yards to Bazata.
The Southerners' kicked out of
bounds and Stanford punted 40
yards. Southern California was
unable to gain and was forced to
kick. Stanford took the ball and
began to buck slowly down the
field, Fisher, Hill, Slaker and
Traeger puncturing the opposing
line with apparent ease. It was
just a steady, plugging advance of
from three to live yards at a time,
with the exception of a sensational
dash around right end by Traeger,
and another a few moments later
by Hill. Slaker crossed the line
and Traeger kicked the goal. Score:
Stanford 6; All-Southern-Califor
nia 0.
All - Southern - California kicked
off to Slaker, who carried the ball
back 10 yards. Bucks and end
runs by Slaker, Cooper, Hill, Fish

er, Clark, Traeger and McFadden
soon brought the ball to within
striking distance of the Southern's
goal, and Slaker again crossed the
line for (lie second touchdown.
Traeger kicked the goal. Score:
Stanford 12; All-Southern-Califor
nia 0.
On the next kick-off Slaker
caught the ball and made a mag
nificent run of 25 yards with pract
ically no interference. Stanford
punted to Southern-California,
which lost the ball on a fumble.
Hill made 5 yards around right
end. Clark, Slaker and Traeger
followed with similar gains. Ball
went to Southern California on off
side play, and the half ended with
it in their possession on their own
25-yard line.
In the second half Stanford sub
stituted Smith for Hill, Roosevelt
for Traeger, and Dole for Clark.
Stanford kicked off to All-Southern-
California's 10-yard line. Bazata
carried the ball back 25 yards. All-
Southern-California punts to Slaker,
who made 10 yards. Stanford lost
ball on off-side play. All-Southern-
California forced to kick on third
down. Stanford punted and All-
Southern - California returned.
Stanford again punted out of
bounds. All - Southern - California
gained a few yards but was forced
to kick, Slaker carrying the ball
back 15 yards. Fisher punted to
All-Southern-California's 15 - yard
line, Wilson carried the ball back
15 yards. All-Southern-California
imnted and Stanford fumbled the
punt, Bentley securing the ball and
making for Stanford's goal. lie was
tackled after 5 yards. After another
interchange of kicks time was called
with the ball in possession of All-
Southern-California in the center
of the field.
At no time was there any danger
of the All-Southern-California scor
ing by straight football. Had
Bentley been a trifle quicker when
he recovered Bazata's fumbled punt
in the second half he might possi
bly have scored.
For Stanford Traeger, Fisher,
Hill, Slaker and McFadden were
the bright particular stars, while
Bazata, Ryas and Salisbury put up
the best game for the Southerners.
The Stanford team was apparently
in excellent condition, while their
opponents were continually forced
to take (jut time for trivial injuries.
23-0 Contest.
On Saturday the Varsity defeated
a team from the Perris Indian
School at Fiesta Park, Los Angeles,
by a score of 23 to 0. Tite 1500
football enthusiasts who turned out
to witness the struggle were re
warded with a contest which, for
good hard playing, was far and
away ahead of the Thanksgiving
game with All-Southern-California.
The Indians were outweighed by
the college men, but had had the
advantage of watching the Thanks
giving game and of seeing the style
of play used by their opponents.
Much was said in Los Angeles prior

to the game of the wonderful en
durance and staying powers of the
Indians. People had heard of the
famous Carlisle team, and many
confused the two. The game itself
was not spectacular. It was clean,
straight football. There were no
long runs, and very little kicking
was resorted to by either side. Not
a Stanford man was hurt during
the game, while after nearly
every scrimmage an Indian or two
would need the attention of the
rubber.
The team lined up at 2:40, the
Indians kicking off. Slaker re
ceived the ball on the 5-yard line
and carried it back 14 yards. The
ball was advanced steadily by
short bucks by Slaker and end
runs by Fisher and Hill until the
5-yard line was reached, when the
lied line held a wall, and the ball
was held on downs.
The Indians were unable to fol
low up their advantage, however,
as they lost the ball on a fumble
after trying three plays. Nettled
by the aggressiveness of the In
dians, the Stanford team braced up
and forced the ball down the field
for the lirst touchdown. On the
kick-off the ball went over the goal
line. Stanford kicked out from
the 25-yard line and the Indians,
after two ineffectual attempts
at the line, were forced to kick.
Stanford gained steadily, and final
ly sent Hill around left end for a
25-yard run and touchdown. The
Indians again kicked over the line.
Stanford kicked out, and the half
ended with the ball in the posses
sion of the Indians. Score, Stan
ford 12, Indians 0.
Stanford kicked off in the second
half, the ball going barely 12
yards. The Indians were unable
to gain, and the sphere came to the
Northeners on downs. After this the
ball was advanced steadily by
short, fierce'bucks and end runs till
Slaker was sent through center for
t e third touchdown. By the
same tactics, Stanford worked down
the field for their fourth and last
touchdown, Slaker being sent out
side of right tackle. For the first
time during the game no goal was
kicked, as the ball was fumbled
and allowed to touch the ground.
The game ended with the ball in
Stanford's possession on the In
dians' 30-yard line.
Finances of the Trip.
The trip was a financial success,
something in the neighborhood of
a thousand dollars being cleared.
Stanford received sixty per cent of
the gate receipts at both games.
Our share for the Thanksgiving
game was '$1383.20; for Saturday's
game, $356.25. The expenses of
the trip amounted to about $750.00.
Captain Fisher on Trip.
Captain Fisher, in speaking of
the southern trip by the football
men, said : "I believe we were en
tertained better than our team ever
has been before. Parties and din
ners were given for us by many
friends. An Alumni banquet was
held in onr honor in Los Angeles.
Colonel Sherman gave us a trip up
Mount Lowe and to Santa Monica.
The Norman's Auxiliary also en
tertained us. All the Alumni did
their best to make the trip a plea^-

ant one. The games were the
cleanest J have ever seen and were
marked by no disputes 'whatever."

23-0 Contest.
On Saturday the Varsity defeated
a team from the Perris Indian
School at Fiesta Park, Los Angeles,
by a score of 23 to 0. Tite 1500
football enthusiasts who turned out
to witness the struggle were re
warded with a contest which, for
good hard playing, was far and
away ahead of the Thanksgiving
game with All-Southern-California.
The Indians were outweighed by
the college men, but had had the
advantage of watching the Thanks
giving game and of seeing the style
of play used by their opponents.
Much was said in Los Angeles prior

to the game of the wonderful en
durance and staying powers of the
Indians. People had heard of the
famous Carlisle team, and many
confused the two. The game itself
was not spectacular. It was clean,
straight football. There were no
long runs, and very little kicking
was resorted to by either side. Not
a Stanford man was hurt during
the game, while after nearly
every scrimmage an Indian or two
would need the attention of the
rubber.
The team lined up at 2:40, the
Indians kicking off. Slaker re
ceived the ball on the 5-yard line
and carried it back 14 yards. The
ball was advanced steadily by
short bucks by Slaker and end
runs by Fisher and Hill until the
5-yard line was reached, when the
lied line held a wall, and the ball
was held on downs.
The Indians were unable to fol
low up their advantage, however,
as they lost the ball on a fumble
after trying three plays. Nettled
by the aggressiveness of the In
dians, the Stanford team braced up
and forced the ball down the field
for the lirst touchdown. On the
kick-off the ball went over the goal
line. Stanford kicked out from
the 25-yard line and the Indians,
after two ineffectual attempts
at the line, were forced to kick.
Stanford gained steadily, and final
ly sent Hill around left end for a
25-yard run and touchdown. The
Indians again kicked over the line.
Stanford kicked out, and the half
ended with the ball in the posses
sion of the Indians. Score, Stan
ford 12, Indians 0.
Stanford kicked off in the second
half, the ball going barely 12
yards. The Indians were unable
to gain, and the sphere came to the
Northeners on downs. After this the
ball was advanced steadily by
short, fierce'bucks and end runs till
Slaker was sent through center for
t e third touchdown. By the
same tactics, Stanford worked down
the field for their fourth and last
touchdown, Slaker being sent out
side of right tackle. For the first
time during the game no goal was
kicked, as the ball was fumbled
and allowed to touch the ground.
The game ended with the ball in
Stanford's possession on the In
dians' 30-yard line.
Finances of the Trip.
The trip was a financial success,
something in the neighborhood of
a thousand dollars being cleared.
Stanford received sixty per cent of
the gate receipts at both games.
Our share for the Thanksgiving
game was '$1383.20; for Saturday's
game, $356.25. The expenses of
the trip amounted to about $750.00.
Captain Fisher on Trip.
Captain Fisher, in speaking of
the southern trip by the football
men, said : "I believe we were en
tertained better than our team ever
has been before. Parties and din
ners were given for us by many
friends. An Alumni banquet was
held in onr honor in Los Angeles.
Colonel Sherman gave us a trip up
Mount Lowe and to Santa Monica.
The Norman's Auxiliary also en
tertained us. All the Alumni did
their best to make the trip a plea^-

ant one. The games were the
cleanest J have ever seen and were
marked by no disputes 'whatever."
The fifteen men who represented
Stanford in the two football games
in Southern California,played dur
ing the Thanksgiving vacation, re
turned to the University today
after an absence of six days. They
played an all-Southern-California
aggregation of players captained
by Phil Wilson, ex-'Ol, Thursday,
defeating it by a score of 12-0.
Saturday they met the plucky rep
resentatives of the Perris Indian
School, whom they easily defeated
by a score of 23-0. Following are
accounts of both games:
12-0 Game.
The game between Stanford and
the team representing all Southern
California was a great success. Two
hours before the game was sched
uled the crowd began to straggle in
to Fiesta Park, and at two forty
five, when the game waH called,
ever} 7 seat was taken Although a
large football game is a new thing
for Los Angeles, the people entered
into the spirit of the game to the
best of their knowledge and ability.
Most of the younger element came
decked out in colors and, although
the black and gold of the local team
naturally predominated, the cardi
nal of the sturdy visitors was much
in evidence.
The yelling was peculiar. There
was very little attempt at organiza
tion, and each individual formu
lated and delivered his own yells.
About a third of the spectators had
evidently never seen a football
game before. Whenever a Southern
man was tackled particularly hard
by a Standfordite, the crowd would
yell foul and storm around as if
some terrible error of football
etiquette had been committed.
Stanford was first on the field
and, after running through a few
plays, gave way to the All-Southern-
Californias. Both teams were
greeted with cheering. Stanford
took the north side of the field and
Southern Calif >rnia the south. The
teams appeared to be about the
same weight,although Stanford was
a trifle heavier. The Southern
Califomias kicked off to Stanford's
20-yard line, Hill returning the
ball 10 yards. On the first line-up
Hill punted 25 yards to Bazata.
The Southerners' kicked out of
bounds and Stanford punted 40
yards. Southern California was
unable to gain and was forced to
kick. Stanford took the ball and
began to buck slowly down the
field, Fisher, Hill, Slaker and
Traeger puncturing the opposing
line with apparent ease. It was
just a steady, plugging advance of
from three to live yards at a time,
with the exception of a sensational
dash around right end by Traeger,
and another a few moments later
by Hill. Slaker crossed the line
and Traeger kicked the goal. Score:
Stanford 6; All-Southern-Califor
nia 0.
All - Southern - California kicked
off to Slaker, who carried the ball
back 10 yards. Bucks and end
runs by Slaker, Cooper, Hill, Fish

er, Clark, Traeger and McFadden
soon brought the ball to within
striking distance of the Southern's
goal, and Slaker again crossed the
line for (lie second touchdown.
Traeger kicked the goal. Score:
Stanford 12; All-Southern-Califor
nia 0.
On the next kick-off Slaker
caught the ball and made a mag
nificent run of 25 yards with pract
ically no interference. Stanford
punted to Southern-California,
which lost the ball on a fumble.
Hill made 5 yards around right
end. Clark, Slaker and Traeger
followed with similar gains. Ball
went to Southern California on off
side play, and the half ended with
it in their possession on their own
25-yard line.
In the second half Stanford sub
stituted Smith for Hill, Roosevelt
for Traeger, and Dole for Clark.
Stanford kicked off to All-Southern-
California's 10-yard line. Bazata
carried the ball back 25 yards. All-
Southern-California punts to Slaker,
who made 10 yards. Stanford lost
ball on off-side play. All-Southern-
California forced to kick on third
down. Stanford punted and All-
Southern - California returned.
Stanford again punted out of
bounds. All - Southern - California
gained a few yards but was forced
to kick, Slaker carrying the ball
back 15 yards. Fisher punted to
All-Southern-California's 15 - yard
line, Wilson carried the ball back
15 yards. All-Southern-California
imnted and Stanford fumbled the
punt, Bentley securing the ball and
making for Stanford's goal. lie was
tackled after 5 yards. After another
interchange of kicks time was called
with the ball in possession of All-
Southern-California in the center
of the field.
At no time was there any danger
of the All-Southern-California scor

Bentley been a trifle quicker when
he recovered Bazata's fumbled punt
in the second half he might possi

short, fierce'bucks and end runs till
Slaker was sent through center for
t e third touchdown. By the
same tactics, Stanford worked down
the field for their fourth and last
touchdown, Slaker being sent out
side of right tackle. For the first
time during the game no goal was
kicked, as the ball was fumbled
and allowed to touch the ground.
The game ended with the ball in
Stanford's possession on the In
dians' 30-yard line.

the gate receipts at both games.
Our share for the Thanksgiving
game was '$1383.20; for Saturday's
game, $356.25. The expenses of
the trip amounted to about $750.00.
Captain Fisher on Trip.
Captain Fisher, in speaking of
the southern trip by the football
men, said : "I believe we were en
tertained better than our team ever
has been before. Parties and din
ners were given for us by many
friends. An Alumni banquet was
held in onr honor in Los Angeles.
Colonel Sherman gave us a trip up
Mount Lowe and to Santa Monica.
The Norman's Auxiliary also en
tertained us. All the Alumni did
their best to make the trip a plea^-

ant one. The games were the
cleanest J have ever seen and were
marked by no disputes 'whatever."
The fifteen men who represented
Stanford in the two football games
in Southern California,played dur
ing the Thanksgiving vacation, re
turned to the University today
after an absence of six days. They
played an all-Southern-California
aggregation of players captained
by Phil Wilson, ex-'Ol, Thursday,
defeating it by a score of 12-0.
Saturday they met the plucky rep
resentatives of the Perris Indian
School, whom they easily defeated
by a score of 23-0. Following are
accounts of both games:
12-0 Game.
The game between Stanford and
the team representing all Southern
California was a great success. Two
hours before the game was sched
uled the crowd began to straggle in
to Fiesta Park, and at two forty
five, when the game waH called,
ever} 7 seat was taken Although a
large football game is a new thing
for Los Angeles, the people entered
into the spirit of the game to the
best of their knowledge and ability.
Most of the younger element came
decked out in colors and, although
the black and gold of the local team
naturally predominated, the cardi
nal of the sturdy visitors was much
in evidence.
The yelling was peculiar. There
was very little attempt at organiza
tion, and each individual formu
lated and delivered his own yells.
About a third of the spectators had
evidently never seen a football
game before. Whenever a Southern
man was tackled particularly hard
by a Standfordite, the crowd would
yell foul and storm around as if
some terrible error of football
etiquette had been committed.
Stanford was first on the field
and, after running through a few
plays, gave way to the All-Southern-
Californias. Both teams were
greeted with cheering. Stanford
took the north side of the field and
Southern Calif >rnia the south. The
teams appeared to be about the
same weight,although Stanford was
a trifle heavier. The Southern
Califomias kicked off to Stanford's
20-yard line, Hill returning the
ball 10 yards. On the first line-up
Hill punted 25 yards to Bazata.
The Southerners' kicked out of
bounds and Stanford punted 40
yards. Southern California was
unable to gain and was forced to
kick. Stanford took the ball and
began to buck slowly down the
field, Fisher, Hill, Slaker and
Traeger puncturing the opposing
line with apparent ease. It was
just a steady, plugging advance of
from three to live yards at a time,
with the exception of a sensational
dash around right end by Traeger,
and another a few moments later
by Hill. Slaker crossed the line
and Traeger kicked the goal. Score:
Stanford 6; All-Southern-Califor
nia 0.
All - Southern - California kicked
off to Slaker, who carried the ball
back 10 yards. Bucks and end
runs by Slaker, Cooper, Hill, Fish

er, Clark, Traeger and McFadden
soon brought the ball to within
striking distance of the Southern's
goal, and Slaker again crossed the
line for (lie second touchdown.
Traeger kicked the goal. Score:
Stanford 12; All-Southern-Califor
nia 0.
On the next kick-off Slaker
caught the ball and made a mag
nificent run of 25 yards with pract
ically no interference. Stanford
punted to Southern-California,
which lost the ball on a fumble.
Hill made 5 yards around right
end. Clark, Slaker and Traeger
followed with similar gains. Ball
went to Southern California on off
side play, and the half ended with
it in their possession on their own
25-yard line.
In the second half Stanford sub
stituted Smith for Hill, Roosevelt
for Traeger, and Dole for Clark.
Stanford kicked off to All-Southern-
California's 10-yard line. Bazata
carried the ball back 25 yards. All-
Southern-California punts to Slaker,
who made 10 yards. Stanford lost
ball on off-side play. All-Southern-
California forced to kick on third
down. Stanford punted and All-
Southern - California returned.
Stanford again punted out of
bounds. All - Southern - California
gained a few yards but was forced
to kick, Slaker carrying the ball
back 15 yards. Fisher punted to
All-Southern-California's 15 - yard
line, Wilson carried the ball back
15 yards. All-Southern-California
imnted and Stanford fumbled the
punt, Bentley securing the ball and
making for Stanford's goal. lie was
tackled after 5 yards. After another
interchange of kicks time was called
with the ball in possession of All-
Southern-California in the center
of the field.
At no time was there any danger
of the All-Southern-California scor
ing by straight football. Had
Bentley been a trifle quicker when
he recovered Bazata's fumbled punt
in the second half he might possi
bly have scored.
For Stanford Traeger, Fisher,
Hill, Slaker and McFadden were
the bright particular stars, while
Bazata, Ryas and Salisbury put up
the best game for the Southerners.
The Stanford team was apparently
in excellent condition, while their
opponents were continually forced
to take (jut time for trivial injuries.
23-0 Contest.
On Saturday the Varsity defeated
a team from the Perris Indian
School at Fiesta Park, Los Angeles,
by a score of 23 to 0. Tite 1500
football enthusiasts who turned out
to witness the struggle were re
warded with a contest which, for
good hard playing, was far and
away ahead of the Thanksgiving
game with All-Southern-California.
The Indians were outweighed by
the college men, but had had the
advantage of watching the Thanks
giving game and of seeing the style
of play used by their opponents.
Much was said in Los Angeles prior

to the game of the wonderful en
durance and staying powers of the
Indians. People had heard of the
famous Carlisle team, and many
confused the two. The game itself
was not spectacular. It was clean,
straight football. There were no
long runs, and very little kicking
was resorted to by either side. Not
a Stanford man was hurt during
the game, while after nearly
every scrimmage an Indian or two
would need the attention of the
rubber.
The team lined up at 2:40, the
Indians kicking off. Slaker re
ceived the ball on the 5-yard line
and carried it back 14 yards. The
ball was advanced steadily by
short bucks by Slaker and end
runs by Fisher and Hill until the
5-yard line was reached, when the
lied line held a wall, and the ball
was held on downs.
The Indians were unable to fol
low up their advantage, however,
as they lost the ball on a fumble
after trying three plays. Nettled
by the aggressiveness of the In
dians, the Stanford team braced up
and forced the ball down the field
for the lirst touchdown. On the
kick-off the ball went over the goal
line. Stanford kicked out from
the 25-yard line and the Indians,
after two ineffectual attempts
at the line, were forced to kick.
Stanford gained steadily, and final
ly sent Hill around left end for a
25-yard run and touchdown. The
Indians again kicked over the line.
Stanford kicked out, and the half
ended with the ball in the posses
sion of the Indians. Score, Stan
ford 12, Indians 0.
Stanford kicked off in the second
half, the ball going barely 12
yards. The Indians were unable
to gain, and the sphere came to the
Northeners on downs. After this the
ball was advanced steadily by
short, fierce'bucks and end runs till
Slaker was sent through center for
t e third touchdown. By the
same tactics, Stanford worked down
the field for their fourth and last
touchdown, Slaker being sent out
side of right tackle. For the first
time during the game no goal was
kicked, as the ball was fumbled
and allowed to touch the ground.
The game ended with the ball in
Stanford's possession on the In
dians' 30-yard line.
