## Facts About the Work of the University Association.—Pamphlet Being Printed. 
### 
The Young Men's Christian As
sociation lias increased its roll of
members l>y over seventy names
this semester, making its member
ship larger than ever before in the
history of the University. With
the expansion of the membership
the activity of the Association is
widening and it is gradually rising
to take its legitimate place as the
most potent factor in our Univer
sity community. In previous years
the faculty have been the chief
financial supporters of the work of
the Association, and have this year
contributed their usual amount.
With the increase in the budget,
however, the student body, which
has heretofore been neglected in
raising the funds, is this year to be
given the opportunity to show its
approval and support of the work
that is being done. In other insti
tutions the students are the largest
contributors towards the main
tenance of the Association. And it
is right that it should be so, since
the student body is larger in num
bers than any other class of con
tributors, and also because the work
is a voluntary effort of the students
for the students. There are, no
doubt, few men in the University
with a comfortable allowance who
are not willing to devote a dollar
or more to this work, if they knew
about the work and had the oppor
tunity to subscribe.
That there are many men in the
University who do not know what
the Stanford Young Men's Chris
tian Association is, and what it
endeavors to do, and that many of
those who do know something
about it have strange misconcep
tions concerning it, is to no small
extent the fault of the Association
itself. In view of this fact the Y. M.
C. A. has printed a little sheet es
pecially prepared to present the
needs of the work, but giving some
crisp data and information about
the Association, —what it is, and
what it does, and what it stands for.
By practical helpfulness and by
adequately filling the place which
is not otherwise provided for by the
University, it is hoped that the
Association will merit a higher
reputation than the old uncompli
mentary one, of which, to be sure,
it was not altogether unworthy, and
that it will soon be well under
stood that the Association is neither
a charity organization nor a church,
but an organization and work of
the students for the students, and—
it is to be trusted—largely by the
students. There is an exceptional
opportunity in the University for
men to learn the lesson of "the
debt of strength," the debt of
superior talent, the debt of terms of
money or of whatever a man may
have in more abundance than his
fellows. From these considera
tions and others vvhjch will appear
on this little sheet, which will be
placed as far as possible in the
hands of every Stanford man this
week, the Association hopes toenter
the second semester unhampered
by a dragging financial policy and
be thus free to widen and intensify
its work.
