## 
### 
As Professor C. H. Rammelkamp
remarked in the course of his after
dinner speech last Thursday even
ing, the Y. M. C. A. is to he fer
vently thanked for giving fifty stu
dents who are strangers in a far
country the opportunity of enjoy
ing a Thanksgiving spread that was
not of the hoarding-house variety.
Despite the dismal weather, nearly
every place available at the Palo
Alto Hotel tables was occupied,
and the Association may congratu
late itself on the success of its first
annual banquet. The toasts re
sponded to after the repast were in
the happiest of veins. Professor
Rammelkamp broke the ice with a
comical account of his experiences
as a "faculty freshman," giving
way to Prof. It. M. Aiden of the
English department, who talked of
"Thanksgiving from the Faculty
Standpoint." Scintillating as were
his sentences, the scribe may per
haps be pardoned for carrying
awav only the statement that the
Daily Palo Alto is, in the pro
fessor's estimation, the best college
daily in existence. Other toasts
were: " The Next Banquet," Lloyd
Harter, '01; " The Athletic Associa
tion Project," M. F. McCormick,
'02; "The Pacific Grove Confer
ence," Angus Hull, '04; "Our Ath
letic Prospects," J. 0. McCaughern,
'03; "The Junior Class," A. S.
Williams, '08; "The Freshman
Class," J. Coleman, '05.
