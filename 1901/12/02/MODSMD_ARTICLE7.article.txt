The trip of the Varsity football
team to Southern California was n
great success. The student hotly
realized about $1000 profit. The
men themselves had an excellent
trip and a pleasant vacation.
Southern California people were
impressed favorably by the behav
ior of our representatives, and the
University was indirectly benefited.
The next thing to be considered
is a trip for the second team men
during the Christmas holidays. It
is the unanimous desire of the stu
dent body that these men who have
worked so faithfully for their col
lege during the football season be
shown some recognition and appre
ciation for their services. Little
more than three weeks remains be
fore Christmas. If they go either
to Portland or to Salt Lake, defi
nite arrangements should be made
at once so that the players may
be notified in time to begin light
practice.
