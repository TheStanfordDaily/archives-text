# DISCUSS THE GYMNASIUM.
## Students of All Branches of Student Body Activities Interested in the Building. 
### 
Ever since Mrs. Stanford au
thorized the official announcement
that a new gymnasium will be
built, equal to any in the world,
every student has been speculating
upon and discussing the details of
its equipment. The plans they
have devised cannot but meet with
the approval of the entire student
body, because there is no other way
in which a sum of money may be
expended and accomplish as much
absolute good in so many different
ways and with so many different
individuals.
The athlete thinks of the need
for a training-house and wonders if
the gymnasium will take its place;
he asks whether there will be a
clean, adequate rubbing-room and
drying-room, where the suits may
be aired and dried; a reception
room, where visiting teams may
come; offices of the student body
treasurer, which are convenient
and commodious; and a supply
room and store-room where athletic
supplies and outfits may be kept in
safety. They would like to have
the athletic fields convenient to the
gymnasium, so that the athletes
themselves and the regular gym
nasium students may have free ac
cess to them, and to the track
especially.
The handball crank hopes there
will be a sufficient number of
courts to accommodate the many
devotees of this most popular sport;
that there will be one court of reg
ulation size, with a gallery, where
intercollegiate contests may be
played. This might, be in the near
future were there a regular court
for the candidates to practice on.
Good material there is already,
and the handball courts, make
shifts as they are, are in constant
use.
Then there are those who do not
care to, or can not, take part in in
tercollegiate athletics, and who are
deserving of recognition, who won
der whether accommodations wil 1 be
made for them. They look forward
to a. well cared for field with base
ball, basket-ball and association
football provided for, grounds that
are kept free of weeds, where the
places for the different sports are
well marked and not cut up in wet
weather by teams. This class of
men who do not appear on our in
tercollegiate field is composed of
the majority of the students who
desire, and who are entitled, to
some outdoor exercise.
The team men want an indoor
court where they may play when
the weather is inclement. The track
men would like to see an indoor
track, about ten laps, with places
for high and broad jump and pole
vault. For instance, at the Notre
Dame there is a room two stories
high, well lighted, with dirt floor
and with a gallery on the second
floor. This would allow all the
students to get that much needed
exercise on the track without leav
ing the building, and would allow
the regular track men to keep in
training rain or shine.
There are other students whose

physical make-up does not permit
them to do the work of the regular
gymnasium. These men hope to
see a special room litted with ap
paratus especially suited to their
needs, where they can be carefully
supervised hy the one who is in
charge of the gymnasium. . There
they can work without the constant
annoyance of the passing to and
fro of the regular classes.
The gymnast, the crack man on
the apparatus, and there are many
of them, hopes for many improved
pieces of apparatus on which he can
perfect his "stunts" and develop
new ones, such as triple bars, sta
tionary spring-boards, double air
springs and pyramid mats.
Those who are interested in box
ing, wrestling and fencing hope to
have special accommodations made
for them. They wish to have suf
ficient equipment provided, as
gloves, mats, foils, body protectors,
and a room where such work can
be done without the constant an
noyance of a crowd of spectators.
Bowling is a sport enthusiastically
followed by many who would like
t ) see a bowling alley tilted up.
Every student without exception
hopes to have a large, commodious
plunge bath of sufficient size and
depth to permit swimming. Apart
from the pleasure and exercise of
those who can swim, they wish to
see classes in that most important
of artsâ€”swimming.
All of these interests, except
bowling and swimming, have been
provided for in the old gym, as
well as is possible with its accom
modations and equipment. It is
still realized by the average student
that in the old, inadequate gymna
sium every branch of athletics the
students have shown an interest in
lias been recognized and will be
provided for. This has caused the
attendance of the gymnasium to
increase even though that of the
University has decreased. Uncon
sciously, perhaps, the students ap
preciate the efforts done in their
behalf and gather where those in
terests are provided for.
All look forward to accommoda
tions for physical medical examina
tion as a place where measurments
may be made, strength tests taken,
and the heart and lungs tested.
They wish to see a room well
lighted, well heated and well aired.
This most important point of the
gymnasium, without which students
might be doing themselves great
harm, is not to be neglected, but
offices conveniently situated and
fitted with the most modern im
provements, and so located that
there will be some degree of privacy
to be had.
All hope to see a library stocked
with periodicals and books treating
of gymnastics and athletics, games,
training and physical development;
a place where any student may go
and pass an hour reading what is
of interest to those who exercise.
Last, but not by any means least,
every student who has ever taken
work in the old gymnasium with
its crowded floor space, its damp
ness and cold, its lack (if apparatus,
looks forward with great eagerness
to a new drill hall, provided with
many pieces of apparatus, well
aired, heated, and of sufficient size

that the man on horse need not be
in danger of being kicked in the
face by the man on the rings. They
look to a. drill hall built to accom
modate 300 men, fitted with drill
apparatus, including enough Indian
clubs to permit them to be used by
the classes.
All look forward to a well lighted
and heated and aired locker-room
with benches ; lockers where the
suits will not remain damp all
through the winter; locker-rooms
where twenty men will not have to
dress in aspace hardly large enough
to accommodate five. Then, too, the
student when he thinks of what the
new gymnasium will mean to him
does not overlook the showers and
plunge bath. He hopes to see
enough showers to accommodate the
demand, showers that are not ice
colli and which are not a positive
menace to men with poor constitu
tions. He looks for a drying-room
where he will not have to hang his
towel on the wet, slimy floor.
There is no doubt in the mind of
any student but that the gymna
sium will be one of the best; yet
every enthusiast wishes to find in
the new building the branch of work
that most interests him. He ex
pects to be lost for a moment in
the maze of improvements and
modern facilities, but shortly he
will adjust himself to accommoda
tions he hardly dared hope for in
the ancient days of the old gymna
sium. When the student of some
years in the future takes his drill
in the large, well equipped drill
room, plays handball in the new
courts, takes his track work on the
indoor oval, plays tennis or bowls,
and when, after exercising, jumps
into the plunge bath and runs to
the showers and clean, healthy dry
ing-room, and then to dress in the
clean locker-room, be will not re
alize what the old students did in
the old gymnasium, and did well.

safety. They would like to have
the athletic fields convenient to the
gymnasium, so that the athletes
themselves and the regular gym
nasium students may have free ac
cess to them, and to the track
especially.
The handball crank hopes there
will be a sufficient number of
courts to accommodate the many
devotees of this most popular sport;
that there will be one court of reg
ulation size, with a gallery, where
intercollegiate contests may be
played. This might, be in the near
future were there a regular court
for the candidates to practice on.
Good material there is already,
and the handball courts, make
shifts as they are, are in constant
use.
Then there are those who do not
care to, or can not, take part in in
tercollegiate athletics, and who are
deserving of recognition, who won
der whether accommodations wil 1 be
made for them. They look forward
to a. well cared for field with base
ball, basket-ball and association
football provided for, grounds that
are kept free of weeds, where the
places for the different sports are
well marked and not cut up in wet
weather by teams. This class of
men who do not appear on our in
tercollegiate field is composed of
the majority of the students who
desire, and who are entitled, to
some outdoor exercise.
The team men want an indoor
court where they may play when
the weather is inclement. The track
men would like to see an indoor
track, about ten laps, with places
for high and broad jump and pole
vault. For instance, at the Notre
Dame there is a room two stories
high, well lighted, with dirt floor
and with a gallery on the second
floor. This would allow all the
students to get that much needed
exercise on the track without leav
ing the building, and would allow
the regular track men to keep in
training rain or shine.
There are other students whose

physical make-up does not permit
them to do the work of the regular
gymnasium. These men hope to
see a special room litted with ap
paratus especially suited to their
needs, where they can be carefully
supervised hy the one who is in
charge of the gymnasium. . There
they can work without the constant
annoyance of the passing to and
fro of the regular classes.
The gymnast, the crack man on
the apparatus, and there are many
of them, hopes for many improved
pieces of apparatus on which he can
perfect his "stunts" and develop
new ones, such as triple bars, sta
tionary spring-boards, double air
springs and pyramid mats.
Those who are interested in box
ing, wrestling and fencing hope to
have special accommodations made
for them. They wish to have suf
ficient equipment provided, as
gloves, mats, foils, body protectors,
and a room where such work can
be done without the constant an
noyance of a crowd of spectators.
Bowling is a sport enthusiastically
followed by many who would like
t ) see a bowling alley tilted up.
Every student without exception
hopes to have a large, commodious
plunge bath of sufficient size and
depth to permit swimming. Apart
from the pleasure and exercise of
those who can swim, they wish to
see classes in that most important
of artsâ€”swimming.
All of these interests, except
bowling and swimming, have been
provided for in the old gym, as
well as is possible with its accom
modations and equipment. It is
still realized by the average student
that in the old, inadequate gymna
sium every branch of athletics the
students have shown an interest in
lias been recognized and will be
provided for. This has caused the
attendance of the gymnasium to
increase even though that of the
University has decreased. Uncon
sciously, perhaps, the students ap
preciate the efforts done in their
behalf and gather where those in
terests are provided for.
All look forward to accommoda
tions for physical medical examina
tion as a place where measurments
may be made, strength tests taken,
and the heart and lungs tested.
They wish to see a room well
lighted, well heated and well aired.
This most important point of the
gymnasium, without which students
might be doing themselves great
harm, is not to be neglected, but
offices conveniently situated and
fitted with the most modern im
provements, and so located that
there will be some degree of privacy
to be had.
All hope to see a library stocked
with periodicals and books treating
of gymnastics and athletics, games,
training and physical development;
a place where any student may go
and pass an hour reading what is
of interest to those who exercise.
Last, but not by any means least,
every student who has ever taken
work in the old gymnasium with
its crowded floor space, its damp
ness and cold, its lack (if apparatus,
looks forward with great eagerness
to a new drill hall, provided with
many pieces of apparatus, well
aired, heated, and of sufficient size

that the man on horse need not be
in danger of being kicked in the
face by the man on the rings. They
look to a. drill hall built to accom
modate 300 men, fitted with drill
apparatus, including enough Indian
clubs to permit them to be used by
the classes.
All look forward to a well lighted
and heated and aired locker-room
with benches ; lockers where the
suits will not remain damp all
through the winter; locker-rooms
where twenty men will not have to
dress in aspace hardly large enough
to accommodate five. Then, too, the
student when he thinks of what the
new gymnasium will mean to him
does not overlook the showers and
plunge bath. He hopes to see
enough showers to accommodate the
demand, showers that are not ice
colli and which are not a positive
menace to men with poor constitu
tions. He looks for a drying-room
where he will not have to hang his
towel on the wet, slimy floor.
There is no doubt in the mind of
any student but that the gymna
sium will be one of the best; yet
every enthusiast wishes to find in
the new building the branch of work
that most interests him. He ex
pects to be lost for a moment in
the maze of improvements and
modern facilities, but shortly he
will adjust himself to accommoda
tions he hardly dared hope for in
the ancient days of the old gymna
sium. When the student of some
years in the future takes his drill
in the large, well equipped drill
room, plays handball in the new
courts, takes his track work on the
indoor oval, plays tennis or bowls,
and when, after exercising, jumps
into the plunge bath and runs to
the showers and clean, healthy dry
ing-room, and then to dress in the
clean locker-room, be will not re
alize what the old students did in
the old gymnasium, and did well.
Ever since Mrs. Stanford au
thorized the official announcement
that a new gymnasium will be
built, equal to any in the world,
every student has been speculating
upon and discussing the details of
its equipment. The plans they
have devised cannot but meet with
the approval of the entire student
body, because there is no other way
in which a sum of money may be
expended and accomplish as much
absolute good in so many different
ways and with so many different
individuals.
The athlete thinks of the need
for a training-house and wonders if
the gymnasium will take its place;
he asks whether there will be a
clean, adequate rubbing-room and
drying-room, where the suits may
be aired and dried; a reception
room, where visiting teams may
come; offices of the student body
treasurer, which are convenient
and commodious; and a supply
room and store-room where athletic
supplies and outfits may be kept in
safety. They would like to have
the athletic fields convenient to the
gymnasium, so that the athletes
themselves and the regular gym
