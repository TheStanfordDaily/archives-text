# FRESHMAN GLEE.
## Class Dance Will Last Four Hours, Beginning Promptly at 8 and Stopping at 12. 
### 
The Freshman CI lee will begin
promptly at eight o'clock, Friday
evening, and close at midnight.
The committee for the dance have
had several conferences with Dr.
Jordan relative to having the time
extended, but their efforts were un
availing and the music for the Glee
will be stopped promptly at twelve
o'clock, or class dances will be dis
continued. The matter has been
thoroughly discussed and a strict
rule has resulted, to the effect that
no class dance will be allowed to
continue later than the midnight
hour. It seems that parents of
some students have raised serious
cam plaints because dances were
continued till the small hours of
the morning. These objections have
reached the ears of Mrs. Stanford,
who has announced it as her spec
ial wish that all dancing should
close at the time stated above.
Since it has been definitely set
tled at what time the Glee will
stop, which is some time less than
was expected, it will be necessary
to start earlier in order that the
full program of twenty-six num
bers may be played. Only one en
core will be allowed, and the first
danco will begin promptly at eight
—irrespective of the number pres
ent.
Tickets, at a price of $3, are on
sale at the University Drug Store
on the campus, and at the Palace
Pharmacy in Palo Alto.
