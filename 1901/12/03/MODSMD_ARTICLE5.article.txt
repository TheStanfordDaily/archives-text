# PROPOSES AGREEMENT.
## Debating Committee Draws Up Plans For Washington to Ratify. 
### 
If the agreement prepared by the
Intercollegiate Debating Commit
tee, and approved this afternoon by
the Intel-society Executive Commit
tee, is ratified by the University of
Washington, the first Stanford-
Washington debate will take place
here next April. The proposed
articles, which are given below,
have already been mailed to
the northern university, and pro
vide for two contests. They embody
the suggestions made by a letter
from that institution, but will not
be in force unless approved by the
proper body there. Should the
plan be adopted, our team will
probably be chosen next spring
when the men are selected who will
meet Berkeley in the Intercollegiate.
The plans submitted read thus:
"This agreement between the stu
dents of Stanford University and
the students of the University of
Washington provides for a series of
two annual debates between the two

University of Washington at a fu

upon.
