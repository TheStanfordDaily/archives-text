Intercollkgiat.e debating on
the Pacific Coast will receive a
fresh impetus if the University of
Washington ratifies the proposed
agreement with Stanford. Al
though these articles provide for
only two debates, they probably
open the way for permanent rela
tions. The Intercollegiiite Com
mittee deserves congratulations for
the character of the plans drawn
up, which will 110 doubt be ap
proved by Washington, as they em
body the suggestions submitted
from that source. A broad field is
always an advantage, and it is
wise to reach beyond state lines for
intercollegiate contests. Unlike
football, little if any disadvantage
is suffered in debate by a college
with a smaller number of students
to draw from, and the meeting of
these institutions will arouse inter
est all over the Coast. It should
lead to a similar arrangement with
Oregon and other universities.
With enlarged opportunity, the in
centive will develop much debating
material at Stanford that has never
before come to the front because it
was known that there was room
for very few men to participate in
intercollegiate debates.
