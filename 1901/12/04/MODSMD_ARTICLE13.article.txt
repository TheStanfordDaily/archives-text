Today's announcement that the
East and Middle West, represented
by the University of Michigan, and
the Pacific Coast, represented by
Stanford, are likely to meet in the
football arena on New Year's Day,
comes somewhat as a surprise to
all concerned, for negotiations
toward a holiday game with a
trans-Mississippi team have until
now been fruitless. Although the
proposed plan has many critics,
tin! Daily I'alo Alto sees no ade
quate reason for such criticism,
provided that the University as a
whole, and the eleven men who will
share the bulk of the responsibility,
go into the preparations with a
sane idea of what the responsibility
really is. From a purely senti
mental point of view, there is not a
man of proper age to appreciate
the sport who would not be anxious
to see Michigan's wonderful foot
ball machine pitted against the
representatives of the Cardinal,
(iiven favorable weather, the match
would surely attract an immense
crowd, making the venture a glow
ing success financially. Hut just
at this point arises our only mis
giving, which perhaps is unjusti
fied: Is it as a money-catcher, a
holiday affair, a " fake fight," that
we are going into this contest? Or
are we anxious only to see college
pitted against college, West against
East, a team whose strength has
been proven in ;i season of unbroken
victory, against one whose strength
we till confide in, unavailing as it
proved in the crucial game? If the
former is our attitude, the sooner
the matter is dropped the better:
Stanford does not play football for

[gain. If the latter, let us by all
i means have the game. We niii√üt
go at (his contest seriously, for
| Michigan's playing is not of the
S farce order.
