# Nomination for Editor.
## 
### 
At a called meeting of the As
sociated Students this afternoon at
1:15 in the chapel, the name of Itoy
O. Had ley, '03, was placed in nomi
nation for editor-in-chief of the
Daily I'alo Alto for next semester.
Unless other nominations are made
before December 11th, at which
time the election for this office will
take place, the Executive Commit
tee will pass on the one nominee,
thus avoiding a student body elec
tion, which would be necessary.
This is the third consecutive
time that the office for editor has
not been contested. All three can
didates served their terms as manag
ing editor before coming out for
the highest office.
