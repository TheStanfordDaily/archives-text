# MURPHY AGAIN IN MOLESKINS
## Former Stanford Captain Wins New Football Laurels at Harvard.—Cardinal Rooters in Evidence. 
### 
According to the Daily Advertiser
of Saturday, November 23d, "Chet"
Murphy, quarter-back on four
Stanford Varsity teams and cap
tain during the season of '99, has
won an enviable reputation for
himself and the Cardinal in foot
ball circles at Harvard. Murphy
is a student in the Law School, and
being ineligible for an "H" on ac
count of the four-year rule, he has
been devoting his recreation to the
Law School aggregation. Eleven
universities were represented on the
team, three of the players having
been captains in their undergrad
uate days.
Says the Advertiser of the match
with Vale Law School of November
2'2d, the first ever played between
the embryo legal lights of the
two institutions:
Eli was trounced 24 0. Most
of the lirst half and the whole of
the second Harvard carried the
ball through the Yale line without
a fumble.
A more interesting game has not
often been played, nor one in which
Yale was so impotent. Hut the
cheering was its most unusual fea
ture. So many different cheers
were heard that the spectators for
got they were on a Harvard grid
iron.
Northwestern, which furnished
Captain Ferry; lowa, Stanford,
Grinnell, Beloit, etc., were vigor
ously cheered by enthusiastic groups
of men who were living over again
the glorious college days out West.
Among these prolific cheerers
none were more ingenious than the
Stanford crowd, whose great cap
tain, Murphy, was Harvard's quar
ter-back and played Ihe most bril
liant game any quarter-back has
played on Soldier's Field this year.
The Stanford group made a bit
with their —
'Ladies and gents; ladies and gents;
Centre King is simply immense!'
They followed up with a histori
cal cry: 'We have met the enemy
and they are conquered.'
Murphy was inexhaustible. His
fake drop-kick was the neatest
play sprung in the game and fooled
everyone, most of all the El is, for
he got 40 yards on it. Delayed
passes and quarter-back kicks were
used to good effect to gain distance.
Harvard's defence in the first
half on her 5-yard line was excel
lent. After they got the ball Yale
never regained it.
