# Intercollegiate College Conference.
## 
### 
The faculty representatives of
the Intercollegiate College Confer
ence passed the following at a meet
ing in Chicago last week: " No stu
dent is eligible to compete in a
college team who plays in so-called
amateur, semi-professional or pro
fessional baseball games where gate
money is charged, or where prizes,
premiums, or purses are offered."
It was voted to discourage as far as
possible prolonged absences from
college on tours. The bicycle
event, was dropped from all the
programs of college meets in future.
A rule was passed that the four
year limit in college athletics
means four years in the aggregate,
and not four years on any one
team.
