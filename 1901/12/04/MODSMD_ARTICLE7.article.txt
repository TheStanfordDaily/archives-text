# ON THE DIAMOND.
## General Conclusions to be Drawn From Fall Practice. 
### 
The continual rains of the last
few days have interrupted the fall
baseball practice, which was well
I under way before the Thanksgiving
recess, and on account of the near
approach of the final examinations
jit is doubtful whether the candi
dates will be called out again this
semester. The short time of prac
tice has not been very good for
bringing out a great amount of ma
terial. Coach Swindells has to face
a peculiar situation this year in
that he will have to develop pract
ically an entirely new team. This
is almost the lirst year that some
of the baseball stars have not re
turned, and with the exception of
Captain Cowden and Parker, the
coach faces entirely green material,
and will have to look around for
new men for nearly every position.
Notwithstanding this fact, both
Coach Swindells and Captain Cow
den look for a good team to repre
sent Stanford. It will not be a star
team, but one that will do hard,
conscientious work.
The idea of having fall practice
this year has not been to place the
men in any positions, but simply
to loosen up their arms, and to
give the coach some idea of the can
didates he will have for next se
mester.
For the position of catcher the
team seems to be up against a dif
ficult proposition. Hall's place will
be hard to fill, and unless some new
man turns up by Christmas either
Traeger or Knight will have to hold
down the plate, although some of
the freshmen gave indications of
having ability in this line. Cap
tain Cowden will, in all probabili
ty, be found on second base at the
opening of the season, which will
necessitate developing some one to
take his place on the initial bag.
Treasurer lSdwards is busy ar
ranging a schedule of games, and
the prospect is that we shall play
about the same nines as last year.
In addition there will be three
games with Belmont School, which
had a splendid team last year, and
under the coaching of James Lana
gan, Stanford '00, is doing some
line work. There will also be three
games with the Fireman's Fund
team, which will be reorganized
soon. The usual series will be
played with the San Jose Normal,
and in addition it is expected that
the All-National League team,
which is now playing in the State,
will give us a couple of games. The
class games will be played as soon
as possible after the beginning of
spring practice, and after these
games are out of the way the real
work of the season will begin in
earnest. The diamond on the oval
will not be used, as the cramped
condition of the field worked great
injustice to the outfielders. The
old diamond near the Inn will be
used unless the plans for a new
railroad track interfere.
