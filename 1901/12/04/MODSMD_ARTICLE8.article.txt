# "Tommy" McFadden Back.
## 
### 
T. L. McFadden, '00, returned
from Oregon yesterday, and regis
tered this afternoon for work in

the University. He left Stanford
nine weeks ago to coach Pacific
University, at Forest Grove. Ore.,
and gave the northeners a very
successful season. Two games were
lost to Multnomah, but in one of
them the score was only 6-0, which
is unprecedented in games between
the two elevens. The University
of Oregon refused to meet McFad
den's team at first, claiming that
the latter were out of their class;
but a game was arranged, and the
score was only 10-0 in favor of the
state institution. All the other
games were won by big scores.
xMcFadden will continue his law
work this semester and next, lie
may go to Oregon again next year,
as they want him badly. If he
does not go, some other Stanford
man will, as Pacific University
wants nothing but Stanford coaches.
