The following from the Yale
A T ews concerning the running of the
eating establishment at Yale may
he of interest to the Stanford stu
dents.
"At present a regular stated sum
—$4.25 per week— is charged each
man. While this does not at pres
ent cover the whole expense, light
ing, heating, etc., it is expected that
when the system is further per
fected it will more than pay each
man's share. When this state of
affairs takes place, a reduction in
the price of board will be made, so
that by Easter it is hoped that an
even better quality of food may be
served for $4.
"At present there is a salary list
of $5,000 per month and $600 or
$700 is expended for coal and light
each month alone. This may give
some idea of the expenses incurred
in running so vast an establish
ment.
"There are between 800 and 1)00
men eating at the Hall at present
and for these twenty-live or thirty
bushels of potatoes are required
every day. Every time beef is ser
ved it takes 1,200 pounds for the
entire number of guests. The bread
used is baked in the establishment,
and for this four or live barrels of
Hour are used each day. As large
a part as possible of the provisions
used are purchased in New Haven,
but a large amount of the meat is
brought from the West."
