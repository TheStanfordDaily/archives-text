# INN COMMITTEE REPORTS.
## Recommends the Organization of Student Eating Club and Prepares Plans. 
### 
The committee appointed l>y
President Cameron of Enema Club
to investigate and report on the
feasibility of students opening the
Inn on a co-operative basis, and to
suggest a practical plan for its op
eration, report as follows:
After procuring the most reliable
data available regarding the prev
ious expenses of operating the Inn,
and after making the most careful
estimates, upon conferring with
caterers and restaurant men, the
committee has concluded that good,
wholesome board with a variety
and quality of fare above that
which has been served at the Inn
under the previous two manage
ments, can he provided at a very
reasonable rate. It is their unani
mous opinion that owing to the
present condition, namely, the uni
versally high rate of board on the
row, the closing up of the China
man's the last of this month, and
the absence of all eating clubs on
the campus, the students are just
tified in undertaking the scheme.
These conditions make it an abso
lute necessity for adequate and
reasonable eating facilities and as
sure the success of the project.
The proposed plan for conduct
ing the business is as follows: First,
that the students incorporate sim
ilarly to the way the Bookstore is
incorporated. The advantages to
be gained by this organization are
as follows —A reliable business or
ganization which will merit the
confidence of business houses; facil
itate and simplify relations with
the University management; afford
a responsible basis for control and
management of the Jnn affairs; give
solidity and assure continuity in
the business; and furnish a capital
with which to begin. The rough
outline of the scheme of organiza
tion is as follows: The present com
mittee to form corporation and sell
shares at a price not yet deter
mined, but probably at $2.50 per
share. A share will entitle the
holder to vote in the corporation
and to the privilege of rate meal
tickets. There will be no advant
age in controlling more than one
share. All further details will be
carefully worked out by the assist
ance of Professor Green, who is
president of the present Bookstore
corporation, and is thoroughly con
versant with the weakness of the old
one and the virtues of the one now
in operation. The stock-holders
will meet either the end of this
semester, or the tirst of next semes
ter, to elect a board of directors,
who will have direct control of all
the business subject always to the
will of the stockholders. The
stockholders will also elect a com
mittee to draw up by-laws for the
corporation, subject to their ap
proval.
This, in brief, is the scheme for
the organization of the students for
the management of their own eat
ing facilities. The plans for the
dining-room and kitchen areas fol
lows:
First, the employees shall con
sist of an experienced and profic

ient caterer or steward, who shall
he paid on a sliding scale, accord
ing to the number of regular board
ers. He shall have charge of, and
be held responsible to their cor
poration for the buying and service
of the food, with full management
of the kitchen, dining-room, and all
details connected with the success
ful operation of the business; an
accountant who shall handle all
the money and keep a careful ac
count, which shall be published for
the stockholders at frequent stated
periods (it is also recommended
that if a reliable proficient student
can be found, that he, rather than
some one not otherwise connected
with the University, be procured
for this position of accountant); a
first andsecond cook; a head waiter;
and waiters, dish-washers, etc., for
which students are recommended.
It is proposed that the dining
hall be set with tables accommo
dating ten or twelve persons, and
that the meals be served in family
or club style, men who find each
other's company congenial eating
at the same table. There are many
advantages to he gained in this ar
rangement. It will add a social
value to the Inn, offer an induce
ment for men to be prompt, add a
personal interest in the success of
the Inn, he a saving by reducing
the number of waiters, reducing
laundry, and in other minor ways.
There will besides these tables he
accommodations for individual ser
vice. One of the smaller rooms
will be set apart for the ladies, and
the other for tourists and transients.
This latter room will be quite dis
tinct from the main hall in its ap
pointments, designed to cater to
the transient trade in the most ap
proved style. By affording the
very best service at this table it is
hoped to pay a revenue. A
student relishing a few delica
cies, or wishing to entertain
a friend can at any time order from
this room.
As to the rates for board, the
committee believe that it would be
safe to begin by charging $4 per
week. It is quite certain that
when the number of regular board
ers reaches 175 or 200 the price can
be reduced. Some plan which will
he entirely just to the boarder, and
still give ample protection to the
Inn, whereby students will receive
rebate for absences, will be ar
ranged. Two proposals are now
before the committee.

Owing to the limited time re
maining this semester in which to
float the stock and manage the de
tails for opening the Inn with the
return of the students after the
holiday vacation, the committee has
been authorized by President Cam
eron of the Encina Club to go on
with the organization. After con
sulting with some prominent mem
bers of the student body and facul
ty, the committee has undertaken
the work of putting the business on
its feet.
Frank Keesling, '98, attorney
at-law in San Francisco, will
confer with the committee tomor
row afternoon, and papers of incor

poration will be filed immediately
with a view to having the stock
ready for sale as soon as possible.
It is necessary for at least one hun
dred shares to be sold this semester,
since the business must be run on a
cash basis.
The committee will gladly re
ceive from students, faculty and
friends suggestions concerning any
phase of the scheme.

and after making the most careful
estimates, upon conferring with
caterers and restaurant men, the
committee has concluded that good,
wholesome board with a variety
and quality of fare above that
which has been served at the Inn
under the previous two manage
ments, can he provided at a very
reasonable rate. It is their unani
mous opinion that owing to the
present condition, namely, the uni
versally high rate of board on the
row, the closing up of the China
man's the last of this month, and
the absence of all eating clubs on
the campus, the students are just
tified in undertaking the scheme.
These conditions make it an abso
lute necessity for adequate and
reasonable eating facilities and as
sure the success of the project.
The proposed plan for conduct
ing the business is as follows: First,
that the students incorporate sim
ilarly to the way the Bookstore is
incorporated. The advantages to
be gained by this organization are
as follows —A reliable business or
ganization which will merit the
confidence of business houses; facil
itate and simplify relations with
the University management; afford
a responsible basis for control and
management of the Jnn affairs; give
solidity and assure continuity in
the business; and furnish a capital
with which to begin. The rough
outline of the scheme of organiza
tion is as follows: The present com
mittee to form corporation and sell
shares at a price not yet deter
mined, but probably at $2.50 per
share. A share will entitle the
holder to vote in the corporation
and to the privilege of rate meal
tickets. There will be no advant
age in controlling more than one
share. All further details will be
carefully worked out by the assist
ance of Professor Green, who is
president of the present Bookstore
corporation, and is thoroughly con
versant with the weakness of the old
one and the virtues of the one now
in operation. The stock-holders
will meet either the end of this
semester, or the tirst of next semes
ter, to elect a board of directors,
who will have direct control of all
the business subject always to the
will of the stockholders. The
stockholders will also elect a com
mittee to draw up by-laws for the
corporation, subject to their ap
proval.
This, in brief, is the scheme for
the organization of the students for
the management of their own eat
ing facilities. The plans for the
dining-room and kitchen areas fol
lows:
First, the employees shall con
sist of an experienced and profic

ient caterer or steward, who shall
he paid on a sliding scale, accord
ing to the number of regular board
ers. He shall have charge of, and
be held responsible to their cor
poration for the buying and service
of the food, with full management
of the kitchen, dining-room, and all
details connected with the success
ful operation of the business; an
accountant who shall handle all
the money and keep a careful ac
count, which shall be published for
the stockholders at frequent stated
periods (it is also recommended
that if a reliable proficient student
can be found, that he, rather than
some one not otherwise connected
with the University, be procured
for this position of accountant); a
first andsecond cook; a head waiter;
and waiters, dish-washers, etc., for
which students are recommended.
It is proposed that the dining
hall be set with tables accommo
dating ten or twelve persons, and
that the meals be served in family
or club style, men who find each
other's company congenial eating
at the same table. There are many
advantages to he gained in this ar
rangement. It will add a social
value to the Inn, offer an induce
ment for men to be prompt, add a
personal interest in the success of
the Inn, he a saving by reducing
the number of waiters, reducing
laundry, and in other minor ways.
There will besides these tables he
accommodations for individual ser
vice. One of the smaller rooms
will be set apart for the ladies, and
the other for tourists and transients.
This latter room will be quite dis
tinct from the main hall in its ap
pointments, designed to cater to
the transient trade in the most ap
proved style. By affording the
very best service at this table it is
hoped to pay a revenue. A
student relishing a few delica
cies, or wishing to entertain
a friend can at any time order from
this room.
As to the rates for board, the
committee believe that it would be
safe to begin by charging $4 per
week. It is quite certain that
when the number of regular board
ers reaches 175 or 200 the price can
be reduced. Some plan which will
he entirely just to the boarder, and
still give ample protection to the
Inn, whereby students will receive
rebate for absences, will be ar
ranged. Two proposals are now
before the committee.

Owing to the limited time re
maining this semester in which to
float the stock and manage the de
tails for opening the Inn with the
return of the students after the
holiday vacation, the committee has
been authorized by President Cam
eron of the Encina Club to go on
with the organization. After con
sulting with some prominent mem
bers of the student body and facul
ty, the committee has undertaken
the work of putting the business on
its feet.
Frank Keesling, '98, attorney
at-law in San Francisco, will
confer with the committee tomor
row afternoon, and papers of incor

poration will be filed immediately
with a view to having the stock
ready for sale as soon as possible.
It is necessary for at least one hun
dred shares to be sold this semester,
since the business must be run on a
cash basis.
The committee will gladly re
ceive from students, faculty and
friends suggestions concerning any
phase of the scheme.
