Stanford students face an ex
cellent opportunity to rellect credit
on their University, to draw honor
and a name for themselves as well
incidentally to coin a few shekels
for their personal use. This oppor
tunity conies in the way of an offer
by the College Publishing Company
of Boston, of a number of prizes for
essays on any one of four different
subjects, to be competed for by stu
dents of any class in any college in
the United States. The competi
tion will doubtless be fierce, but
Stanford writers have shown
marked ability in many lines of
literary work in the past, and this
chance for personal gain and honor

should be seized by postgraduates,
seniors, juniors, sophomores, and
freslunen alike.
