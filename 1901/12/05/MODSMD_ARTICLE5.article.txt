# PUT ING IN WINDOWS.
## Workmen Now Placing the Beautiful Life of Christ in the Memorial Church. 
### 
The windows for the Memorial
Church, which arrived some few
weeks ago, are now being putin
place. There are forty-seven of
them in all, twenty-seven repre
senting the life of Christ, and the
other twenty depicting prominent
Biblical characters. That they
will add materially to the decora
tive beauty of the Church is at
tested by all who have seen them.
The arrangement of the windows
is being made with a view both to
effectiveness and balance. To the
left of the main entrance are being
placed windows picturing "The
Annunciation," "The Flight into
Egypt," and " Christ in the Car
penter Shop"; and to the right there
will be "And 10, I Am with
You Alway," "The Angel at the
Tomb," and " The Dream of Pilate's
Wife." At the left of the transept
will be "Christ in the Temple,"
" Baptism of Christ," "The Sermon
on the Mount," "Christ Calming
the Storm," and"The liaising of
.Jairus' Daughter"; at the right will
be "Christ in the Garden," "Christ
in the Home of Mary and Martha,"
"Christ, the Good Shepherd,"
"Christ and the Adulteress," and
" Christ Feeding the Multitude."
The three apse windows will por
tray " The Nativity," "The Cruci
fixion," and"The Ascension."
In the nave a series of figures
will represent Abraham, liagar,
Moses, Pharaoh's daughter, Joshua,
Deborah, Hope, St. John, Priscilla,
St. Peter, St. Agnes, St. Stephen;
and over the gallery of the transept
are to be windows representing
David, Ruth, Solomon, Queen of
Sheba, Elijah, Esther, Isaiah, Ju
dith, Hannah, Simon, Anna, Mar
tha, Faith, Mark, Charity, Luke,
Dorcas, and Paul.
The windows are the work of
Frederick Styves Lamb of New
York, and are masterpieces of de
sign and coloring. They are, per
haps, the finest specimens of this
work in the world.
