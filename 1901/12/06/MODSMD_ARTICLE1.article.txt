# PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTS.
## Trained Newspaper Men Stanford Has Produced. What Becomes of "Daily Palo Alto" Editors. 
### 
When Stanford University was
founded, a mistaken report circu
lated throughout the East that a
department of journalism was to
be established. Time has proven
that such a department is unneces
sary; for in San Francisco, Stan
ford-trained newspaper men out
number all other college journalists
very many times. Most of the
men got their preliminary training
on the college daily. Only seven
of the eighteen former editors are
professionalists, but some who are
in the most prominent newspaper
positions now, held subordinate po
sitions while on the undergraduate
staff.
The journalistic spirit was in ev
idence in the early days of the
University. The Daily Palo Alto
was first issued September 19, 1892,
with John C. Capron, '93, as editor
in-chief. After one month, control
passed into the hands of Carl C.
Smith, '93. A high standard was
set from the first, and that stand
ard has been preserved with but
few lapses.
It is thought that a list .of the
editors of the Daily Palo Alto,
with major, class, and present oc
cupation, will prove interesting,
and such a list is given below:
Vol. 1. —Carl C. Smith, History,
'93, LL. B. Northwestern University
'95, was formerly justice of the
superior court at Honolulu, and is
now an attorney at Hilo, Hawaii.
Vol. II. —James F. Wilson, His
tory, '94, teacher of history at the
Boys' High School, New York
City.
Vol. 111. —Arthur C. Trumbo,
Economics,' 94, LL. B. Northwest
ern University '96, is an attorney
in Chicago.
Vol. IV. —Archie B. Rice, Eng
lish, '95, is on the staff of the San
Franeisco Chronicle.
Vol. V. —Robert L. Donald, Civil
Engineering,'9s, is in the employ
of the Southern Pacific Company
at Sacramento.
Vol. VI. —Scott Calhoun, His
tory, '95, is a member of the firm
of Burke iV r . Calhoun, attorneys,
San Francisco.
Vol. VII. —Joseph 11. Timmons,
Economics, '97, was Alameda cor
respondent of the Examiner in 1897,
and is now on the San Francisco
Call.
Vol. Vlll. — Sherri 11 B. Osborne,
Law, '97, is on the staff of the Los
Angeles Express.
Vol. IX.—Will 11. Irwin, Eng
lish, '99, was formerly on the staff
of the San Francisco Chronicle; is
now assistant editor of the Sunday
Chronicle, and editor of the Wave.
He is joint author with Charles K.
Field, '95, of ''Stanford Stories."
Vol. X. —James R. Nourse, Eco
nomics, '97, is on the staff of the
San Francisco Evening Post.
Vol. XL —Charles E. Schwartz,
Economics, '99, was editor of the
Stanford Alumnus until this year.
He is principal of the Longfellow
School at Alameda.
Vol. Xll. —Otho C. Leiter, His

ing department of the Portland
Oregonian.
Vol. Xlll.—Charles P. Cutten,
Law, '99, is an attorney in Eureka.
Vol. XlV.—Everett W. Smith,

Vol. XVI. — Royal C. Victor,

Vol. XVII. —Frank 1). Hamil
ton, Education, ex-'OO, is at his
home in Santa Clara.
Vol. XVIII. — Allan B. Lemmon,
Geology, '01, is working in the

Of these eighteen men, seven:
Rice, '95, Timmons, '97, Osborne,
'97, Irwin, '99, Nourse, '97, Leiter,
'99, and Smith, '99, are professional
journalists; six: Smith, '93, Trum

are pursuing lines of literary work.
The majority are newspaper jour

attained some prominence in this
line.
The following list of those in the

cess in the same line. One of these
won the first prize of $100 offered

When Stanford University was
founded, a mistaken report circu
lated throughout the East that a
department of journalism was to
be established. Time has proven
that such a department is unneces
sary; for in San Francisco, Stan
ford-trained newspaper men out
number all other college journalists
very many times. Most of the
men got their preliminary training
on the college daily. Only seven
of the eighteen former editors are
professionalists, but some who are
in the most prominent newspaper
positions now, held subordinate po
sitions while on the undergraduate
staff.
The journalistic spirit was in ev
idence in the early days of the
University. The Daily Palo Alto
was first issued September 19, 1892,
with John C. Capron, '93, as editor
in-chief. After one month, control
passed into the hands of Carl C.
Smith, '93. A high standard was
set from the first, and that stand
ard has been preserved with but
few lapses.
It is thought that a list .of the
editors of the Daily Palo Alto,
with major, class, and present oc
cupation, will prove interesting,
and such a list is given below:

'93, LL. B. Northwestern University

superior court at Honolulu, and is
now an attorney at Hilo, Hawaii.

When Stanford University was
founded, a mistaken report circu
lated throughout the East that a
department of journalism was to
be established. Time has proven
that such a department is unneces
sary; for in San Francisco, Stan
ford-trained newspaper men out
number all other college journalists
very many times. Most of the
men got their preliminary training
on the college daily. Only seven
of the eighteen former editors are
professionalists, but some who are
in the most prominent newspaper
positions now, held subordinate po
sitions while on the undergraduate
staff.
The journalistic spirit was in ev
idence in the early days of the
University. The Daily Palo Alto
was first issued September 19, 1892,
with John C. Capron, '93, as editor
in-chief. After one month, control
passed into the hands of Carl C.
Smith, '93. A high standard was
set from the first, and that stand
ard has been preserved with but
few lapses.
It is thought that a list .of the
editors of the Daily Palo Alto,
with major, class, and present oc
cupation, will prove interesting,
and such a list is given below:
Vol. 1. —Carl C. Smith, History,
'93, LL. B. Northwestern University
'95, was formerly justice of the
superior court at Honolulu, and is
now an attorney at Hilo, Hawaii.
Vol. II. —James F. Wilson, His
tory, '94, teacher of history at the
Boys' High School, New York
City.
Vol. 111. —Arthur C. Trumbo,
Economics,' 94, LL. B. Northwest
ern University '96, is an attorney
in Chicago.
Vol. IV. —Archie B. Rice, Eng
lish, '95, is on the staff of the San
Franeisco Chronicle.
Vol. V. —Robert L. Donald, Civil
Engineering,'9s, is in the employ
of the Southern Pacific Company
at Sacramento.
Vol. VI. —Scott Calhoun, His
tory, '95, is a member of the firm
of Burke iV r . Calhoun, attorneys,
San Francisco.
Vol. VII. —Joseph 11. Timmons,
Economics, '97, was Alameda cor
respondent of the Examiner in 1897,
and is now on the San Francisco
Call.
Vol. Vlll. — Sherri 11 B. Osborne,
Law, '97, is on the staff of the Los
Angeles Express.
Vol. IX.—Will 11. Irwin, Eng
lish, '99, was formerly on the staff
of the San Francisco Chronicle; is
now assistant editor of the Sunday
Chronicle, and editor of the Wave.
He is joint author with Charles K.
Field, '95, of ''Stanford Stories."
Vol. X. —James R. Nourse, Eco
nomics, '97, is on the staff of the
San Francisco Evening Post.
Vol. XL —Charles E. Schwartz,
Economics, '99, was editor of the
Stanford Alumnus until this year.
He is principal of the Longfellow
School at Alameda.
Vol. Xll. —Otho C. Leiter, His

ing department of the Portland
Oregonian.
Vol. Xlll.—Charles P. Cutten,

Vol. XlV.—Everett W. Smith,

Columbia University law school.
Vol. XVII. —Frank 1). Hamil
ton, Education, ex-'OO, is at his
home in Santa Clara.
Vol. XVIII. — Allan B. Lemmon,
Geology, '01, is working in the
mines at Coleville.
Of these eighteen men, seven:
Rice, '95, Timmons, '97, Osborne,
'97, Irwin, '99, Nourse, '97, Leiter,
'99, and Smith, '99, are professional
journalists; six: Smith, '93, Trum
bo, '96, Calhoun, '95, Cutten, '99,
Nourse, '00, and Victor, '00, are
studying or practicing the profes
sion of law; while the remaining
five men are following the lines of
work for which their respective
courses of study in the University
fitted them.
Many graduates and former stu
dents who were at some time dur
ing their undergraduate work con
nected with the Daily Palo Alto
are pursuing lines of literary work.
The majority are newspaper jour
nalists, many of whom have already
attained some prominence in this
line.
The following list of those in the
field of journalism does not pre
tend to be exhaustive, but it wili
give a fair idea of what Stanford
men are accomplishing in the pro
fession :

story writing. In the "Black Cat"
magazine for February, 1901, ap
peared a story,''The Smile of Joss,"
which brought its author the third
prize of $'200 from the Short Story
Publishing, Co. Besides this tale,
two others of Mr. Neidig's produc
tions have recently achieved sue

cess in the same line. One of these
won the first prize of $100 offered
by the Cycling West of Denver. The
other was awarded the second prize
of $250 in the E. A. Little it Co.

scripts were submitted in this con
