### 
The Chaparral of November 29th,
which arrived on the campus to
day, in one of tlie best numbers of
the semester. Its editorial page
tells about the game which hap
pened several weeks ago, and shows
more soundness and maturity than
usual. Especially noteworthy is a
drawing by \V. C. Francis, ex-'O3,
entitled "A Phase of Stanford Co
education at the Pan-American."
