An Associated Press dispatch,
dated yesterday from Chicago, tells
of a new society at Northwestern.
The article says:
"Following closely on the recent
announcement of the young women
of the Delta Gamma sorority of
Northwestern University that they
were open to proposals of marriage,
conies the formation of a club of
celibates among the young men of
that institution. The Knights of
the Marble Heart is the name of
the new organization, and, as the
name indicates, the club proposes
to give the ' marble heart' to the
young co-eds with matrimonial in
clinations and to cultivate the joys
of jolly bachelorhood.
"The new society of knights is
composed of members of the senior
class, and their organization was
completed tonight at a meeting
held at the residence of Professor
Robert Baird, 2206 Sheridan road,
Evanston. The colors, scarlet and
black, were pinned on the thirteen
charter members, and these will be
worn until the arrival of the so
ciety's pins, which will consist of
small hearts of marble set in gold."
