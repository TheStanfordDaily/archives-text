"As the period of the Christmas
examinations approaches, the code
of honor agitation of the first, half
of the term assumes a more prom
inent form. The scheme of form
ulating a code of honor was intend
ed primarily to check the somewhat
prevalent custom of cheating during
the period of examinations. The
wisdom of formulating such a C'.de
has been seriously doubted. It has
been pointed out that the suscess or
failure of the scheme would be ab
solutely dependent upon the senti
ment of the student body. The ac
tion of any body of men, or of any
fraction of the student body, must,
if it is to be successful, have a united
support back of it.
"The matter thus becomes a per
sonal one. The whole responsibili
ty must rest with the students of
the University in their individual
capacity. Each member of the stud
ent body must frame his own code
of honor, and its laws can only be
binding upon him. There should
be no need of a honor committee.
"The honor system, if it is ever
to pass into successful operation,
will do so because of the desire and
determination of each student.
There is no external hindrance to
prevent its going into immediate
operation. The code of honor will
apply as well and as easily this
Christmas as at any time in the fu
ture. The report of the honor coin
mil,tee is by no means a necessary
antecedent to the successful opera
tion of the system."
