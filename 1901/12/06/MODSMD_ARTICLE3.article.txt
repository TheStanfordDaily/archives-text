# McFadden Appreciated.

### 
The spontaneous way in which
the students responded Thursday
to the plea for football funds, with
which to pay the coach, certainly
shows that all the students are
proud of the team and the show
ing it has made. Not less are they
proud of Coach McFadden, for they
realize that to him more than to
any other, is due the credit for the
performances of this year's team.
The way the student body has met
its obligations is certainly encour
aging.â€” Weekley Index, Pacific Uni
