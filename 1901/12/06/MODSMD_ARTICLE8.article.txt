Today's article on Stanford's
professional journalists may lie of
interest as showing what men have
pursued the literary work begun
during their undergraduate days.
This training is of inestimable
value to anyone who anticipates a
career as a newspaper professional
ise College journalism may not
lie as severe and grinding as that
of public importance, but it is an
excellent preliminary training for
this latter profession. Those men
who today till positions as trained
journalists, attribute much of their
success to the work done on the
staff of the Daily Palo Alto
while in college. A very small
percentage of the former editors of
the Daily have continued in the
field of journalism. However, all
of those men who are following
lines of newspaper work received
preliminary training on this staff.
Outside of the professional edu
cation received by expending time
and labor in the compilation of a
college sheet, there is general train
ing and advantage to lie gained
which must not be slighted. Al
though work along this line helps
nothing towards graduation and
receives no recognition from our
faculty, it does give individual ben
efit. Any person who has kept his
position on the editorial staff for a
semester will attest the truth of
this statement. The training is
applicable and of value to whatever
profession or work you expect to
fol low.
