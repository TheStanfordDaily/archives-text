# Our Electric Lights.

### 
The current for the campus
lights, which was formerly gener
ated at the Redwood City power

house of the Consolidated Light
and Tower Co., was taken from the
wires of the Blue Lakes Company
between October and November.
During this period the quality of
the light was the worst ever known
on the campus, the light being so
irregular in strength its to he prac
tically useless for reading. It has
since been found that the amount
of current registered by the com
pany's meters in the build
ings on the campus during
that period averaged about double
per light per hour what it did
under normal conditions. The re
sult is the consumers have received
hills far larger than they ever did
before, and lnive received the poor
est sort of light.
Numerous complaints have been
made, an(l the Palo Alto patrons
have changed to the town plant in
such numbers that the town is
unable to meet the demands upon
it for electric light.
It would seem but fair tlwat the
Consolidated should make a reduc
tion on account of its poor light
during those weeks instead of
charging double for it.
If those interested will compare
their billsof October and November
this year with the bills for the cor
responding months of last year, and
send a memorandum to this oflice,
with such explanation of any differ
ence in the amount of light used as
they may be able to give, it is be
lieved it can be shown beyond
question that the increase is not
due in any way to the consumers,
but entirely to the poor service of
the company.
