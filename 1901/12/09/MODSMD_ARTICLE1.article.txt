# CONTRACT SIGNED.
## Men Have Resumed Training For the Michigan-Stanford Game at Pasadena. 
### 
The contract with Wagner, presi
dent of the Carnival of Roses at
Pasadena, was signed on Thursday
by Treasurer Edwards for the Mich
igan-Stanford game, which is
scheduled to be played on the after
noon of New Years' Day. The Car
nival management agrees to pay all
expenses of the trip and $100 for
incidental expenses which may
arise aside from the main items.
The scheme is not entered into by
our men with the hope of financial
gain, but wholly from a love of the
sport.
Twenty men will be taken down,
leaving here on Friday, the 20th,
and remaining in Pasadena for
twelve days. At present it has not
been fully decided at which hotel
the training-table will be»run; the
contract calls for training-table
services during their stay, but for
the first two days at least the team
will put up at the Hotel Green. The
twenty men will be chosen during
the next two weeks. All of those
who played against Berkeley will
be included in the twenty. The
remainder will be chosen from the
best of those who turn out for prac
tice. Naramore and McGilvray
will probably go. The intention of
Captain Fisher is to line up on the
first with the very best team possi
ble, in order to make a favorable
showing against Michigan; and the
fact that a man made the big team
at the first of November is not re
garded as sufficient reason for in
suring him a place on the eleven
that will fight, the Eastern men.
The work from now until the
time of the game will tend mainly
to help the players regain their old
form and condition. Each after
noon they will line up for signal
• practice, long end running, and
going down on punts, which are in
tended to develope lung power.
After their arrival in Pasadena
the whole time will be devoted to
training. The men will be under
the charge of "Dad" Moulton and
Captain Fisher, and it is probable
that "Billy" Austin, the rubber,
will appear to loosen the sore
muscles and stiff joints. The team
will be lined up twice a day, in the
morning and afternoon, and a
practice game with the Los Angeles
team may occur early in the week.
If so it will be but lightly contested,
and will have only 15 or 20 minute
halves.
All arrangements, so far as Stan
ford is concerned, were practically
concluded with the signing of the
contract. Manager Edwards will
be with the Musical Clubs, which
perform in Pasadena on the night
of the contest, up to a couple of days
before the game.
