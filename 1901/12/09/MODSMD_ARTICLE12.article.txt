Some of the football men do not
seem to realize the importance of
the game which they have agreed
to play on New Year's Day. They
are apparently not aware of the
heavy responsibility which they
carry in entering on a contest for
the honor of their University; or
possibly that responsibility rests so
lightly on their shoulders that it
attracts little or no attention.
Some men are irresponsible. They
are either so careless of their duties,
oaths and obligations as to never
give them a second thought, or con
sider themselves so serenely in
dependent as to be held account
able to no order or element in so
ciety for their actions.
The fact that many of those men
who have signed training rules pre
paratory to the game with Michi
gan have broken those rules re
peatedly, and seemingly with ease,
would indicate that we have some
men so careless or self-satisfied, or
possibly both, as to be unreliable
when it comes to taking an oath of
honor.
Training is for a purpose.
Utiles define that purpose, and ob
ligations to follow them fulfill it.
These resolutions are doubtless tak
en in good faith, but their import
ance is not appreciated by the ma
jority of the men who have signed
them. "1 am not the only one," is
the excuse offered by each for
treason to bis oath. This is valid;
for it apparently gilds all honor
stains. Mut will this excuse be
accepted by the captain, the trainer
and the University? There is only
one quietus to this habit of disre
garding the oaths, and the personal

requests of .captain and trainer to
keep them. It is an extreme step,
but the sentiment of the student
body will voluntarily and strongly
support Captain Fisher if he finds
it necessary to expel any member
from the Varsity for disregarding
an oath of honor.
