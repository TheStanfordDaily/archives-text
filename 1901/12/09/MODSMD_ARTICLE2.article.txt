# Football Practice.
## 
### 
Saturday evening a fair number
of Varsity men were out on the old
lield for the first football practice
of ;i series which will end only with
the Michigan-Stanford game Janu
ary 1. About an hour and a
half was spent in rapid work, and
much punting was done, together
with practice in falling on the ball

and in use of the tackling-bag. The
policy of the team, it is believed, will
he to do the very fastest work possi
ble, in order to offset the rapid
playing which will be done by
Yost's team. More team work also
will be developed by the Varsity,
as it is felt that this will be the only
way to defeat that done by the
visiting team. Three-fourths of the
time Saturday night was taken up,
however, in signal practice, and the
work done was sharp and vigorous.
The line-up was somewhat changed
from that hitherto in the season,
Naramore, McGilvray and Cooper
playing the ends; Lee and McGil
vray, guards; McFadden and
Roosevelt, tackles; Fisher and
Hill, halves; Bansbach, quarter
back; Naramore and Parker, full
back. In catching a punt a little
while before the signal practice
Slaker broke his finger, but will
not be out of the practices'
Hard work will be done every night
from now on, beginning at half
past four.
