# Gymnasium Exhibition.
## 
### 
About 400 people witnessed the
informal exhibition given by the
Gymnasium Club last Saturday
evening. Twelve members of the
club took part and the exhibition
was an excellent one in every par
ticular. The numbers were run
off promptly and the interest of the
audience never flagged for a
moment. The exhibition was the
equal of the one given last spring, if
not better in some ways. The old
stunts were given as well as before
and there were many new ones.
Especially thrilling was Jesse
Beach's drop from the upper bar
of the horizontal bar. The intro
duction of the long horse gave op
portunity for many new stunts.
There were two men, W. \V. Copp
and J. Reach, did the giant swing
this year, as against one last year.
The work on the mat was espe
cially amusing. The Gymnasium
Club performed in a manner very
creditable to themselves and enter
taining to the audience.

and Gundrum in the handball
game, the Kehrlein brothers in the
fencing bout, and Burton and Davis
in the wrestling bout, which was one
of the best seen here.
