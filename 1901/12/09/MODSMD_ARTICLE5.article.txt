# A 						UNIQUE SUCCESS.
## Freshmen Glee Was Largely Attended. Striking Decorations. 
### 
With dolls and drums and horns
and toys suspended across the hall,
with a Christmas tree by the (ire
place, laden with strings of popcorn
and trinkets, with programs in the
shape of nursing bottles, and with
everything to delight the childish
heart and to suggest the child's
play room, the baby class made a
unique success of its dance hist
Friday evening. Probably no
other Freshman (ilee has ever been
so largely attended, for more than
one hundred couples were present.
The shaded lights and the clusters
of holly berries and ivy gave beau
tiful effect to the mingling of pretty
faces and exquisite gowns in the
hig club room. The patronesses,
Mrs. Jordan, Mrs. Stillman, Mrs.
Goebel, Mrs. Price, Mrs. Wilbur,
Mrs. Frein, Mrs. Storey, Mrs. Ram
sey, Mrs. Henries, Miss Ray, Miss
Perry, Mrs. Burrel, and Mrs.
Lathrop, received by the Christ
mas tree. It was half-past eight
o'clock before Yank's orchestra
struck up the lirst two-step, and as
the lights went out at midnight
the eighteenth and nineteenth reg
ular dances, the third and fourth
extras, and the second grab, had to
be omitted.
The nursing-bottle program was
one of the striking features of the
affair. On the lirst page was a
white "S" with the numerals "'O5"
interwoven, the second page gave
the names of the patronesses, and
after the list of dances appeared
the names of the Glee Committee:
P. A. Tarpey, chairman, Miss S.
Corbett, Miss Maria Teresa Hart
nell, Miss 8. V. Hinking, W. R.
Taylor, H. W. Bell, and T. Mc-
Caughern. On the back of the
program was contained the design
of a football bearing the score of
the Freshman game, 11 too, while
the Berkeley bear sat by weeping.
Punch was served in the lobby
throughout the evening and dur
ing the twelfth, thirteenth and
fourteenth dances. Ices and cake
were also served. The toys which
were used in decomtion have been
sent to the Children's Home at
San Jose.
In marked contrast to the con
ditions prevailing some years ago
when the dances took place in En
cina gymnasium and the Glee was
invariably a financial loss, the
class will clear $100 from the func
tion Friday evening. About $300
was taken in from the sale of tick
ets, and the expenses were in the
neighborhood of $200.
