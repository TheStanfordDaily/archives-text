Mrs. Jane L. Stanford Signs and Delivers Docu
ments Transfering Vast Buildings and Grounds,
Securities and Shares, Appraised
at $30,000,000.

In this morning's San Francisco
papers appeared the news that Mrs.
Jane Lathrop Stanford legally con
firmed the endowment of Stanford
University yesterday, and has
handed over to the Trustees of the
University'all deeds to that effect.
The account in the Chronicle is
as good as could be obtained on
the campus, and is given in full:
Thirty million dollars was deeded
outright to Stanford University yes
terday by Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stan
ford—slB,ooo,ooo of it in gilt-edge
income - bearing first - mortgage
bonds and securities, and $12,000,-
000 of it in an aggregate of nearly
100,000 acres of real estate in twen
ty-six counties of the State of Cali
fornia. This at one sweep surpasses,
three times over, the largest prev
ious single gift every made by one
person in the history of the world.
In addition to this magniiicent
donation to the cause of higher free
education, Mrs. Stanford signed a
large number of contracts, complet
ing plans for the outlay of a total
of $1,500,000 for new university
buildings on the great 9000-acre
campus at Palo Alto.
The transfer was made very quiet
ly in a law office in the Mills build
ing in San Francisco in the pres
ence of Mrs. Stanford, Trustees S.
F. Leib, Timothy Hopkins, Charles
(Jr. Lathrop and Joseph 1). Grant,
and of Thomas G. Crothers and
George E. Crothers, two graduates
of tlie university, and the legal
partners who drafted the remark
able deeds of conveyance, and
Mountford S. Wilson, Mrs. Stan
ford's private counsel.
The documents themselves are as
exceptional as the enormous gift.
There are three great parchment
books of them, the pages fifteen
inches wide and twenty-one inches
long, hand written, thirty-four lines
to the page and ten words to the
line, and every page signed across
the margin by Mrs. Stanford in ad
dition to the formal attested signa
tures at the end of the last page.
There are nine of these pages in the
record of the personal property deed
gift, the document that specifies
the stocks and bonds making up
the $18,000,000 revenue producing
interests in corporations. There are
eight pages in the conveyance of
the gift of the 100,000 acres of land
in many parts of California. And
there are seven of these big pages
in the parchment pamphlet record
ing the transfer of the Stanford
residence on Nob Hill, and the con
ditions that it is to be used by Mrs.
Stanford during her lifetime, and
never to be converted into a club
house or a place of undignified
amusement, but employed rather
as ati afliliated college, or a student
branch of the University. Each of
these bulky reams of glistening,
smooth parchment, is bound to
gether at the top by the official
Stanford cardinal ribbon run

through metal eyelets, and secured
with red sealing wax. All the de
scriptions of property are briefly
stated, with mere references to the
detailed descriptions contained in
other records.
The form of each conveyance is
like the others. It begins:
i, Jane Lathrop Stanford, hereby
give, grant, bargain, sell, convey,
transfer, assign, confirm and de
liver unto the board of trustees of
Leland Stanford Jr. University
and to their successors forever, the
property hereinafter described or
designated, including all my rights
therein and thereto as widow, heir,
legatee, or devisee of my late hus
band, Leland Stanford. * * *
To have and to hold, all of said
property by the trustees of the Le
land Stanford Jr. University, upon
the trusts provided for in the grant
founding the University, and
amendments thereof, and grants,
bequests, and devises supplement
ary thereto, within the meaning of
the above words, reading upon the
trusts provided f'.r in the grant
founding the University and amend
ments thereof and grants, bequests,
and devises supplementary thereto,
as such words are used in such con
stitutional amendment."
Then follows the designation of
the property to be conveyed. 111
the case of the mansion on Nob
Hill there is this special clause:
"Subject, however, to the right of
the party of the first part to keep,
use, have, and enjoy the same and
the whole thereof for and during
the term of her natural life and
thereafter the same shall be dedi
cated and set aside as an afliMated
college or department of the Le
land Stanford Jr. University, or as
a library for the use of the students
of said University and the people
of the city and county of San Fran
cisco for the instruction of said
students and people, in such mode
and manner and with such limita
tions as said board of trustees and
their successors may deem best,
or for any of the other uses herein
before referred to, but the same
shall never be appropriated for the
use of a.clubhouse, a hoarding
house, or place of undignified
amusement."
Very carefully have the articles
been drawn by Crothers & Crothers,
two among the forty Stanford grad
uate lawyers in San Francisco, the
same two young men who drew
up the Stanford Constitutional
amendment that recently passed to
law by a general vote of the people
of California, fi. vote that meant
that hereafter Stanford may be per
mitted to receive gifts and endow
ments from any|one outside or in
side the state of California, of any
property anywhere. Every pre
caution was taken to make this fi
nal transfer absolutely law and
suit proof. So this clause was in
serted in the deeds.

"This grant shall not be defeated
by reason of the invalidity < 112 any
of the trusts herein provided for, or
by the invalidity of the aforesaid
constitutional amendment, and if
any of the powers vesting in me,
by operation of law or otherwise,
shall be inconsistent with the pas
sage hereunder to said trustees of
the legal title to any portion of
said property, in trust, as herein
provided, then it is my intention
that such power or powers shall be
so limited as to permit of the vest
ing of such legal title; and, in either
event, 1 hereby grant said property
upon such trusts and terms herein
provided as are valid, and prescribe
that the legal title shall vest in the
said trustees accordingly."
Finally there is the attesting
paragraph and the signatures of
the witnesses and the acceptance
by the president of the board of
trustees, along with their signa
tures, and the date:
"In witness whereof, I, Jane
Lathrop Stanford, have hereunto
set my hand and seal at the city
and county of San Francisco, State
of California, this 9th day of De
cember, A. 1)., nineteen hundred
and one. Jane L. Stanford (Seal.)
Signed, sealed and delivered in
the presence of
George E. Crotiieks,
T. G. CIiOTHERS,
Frank L. Owen,
Mountj-ord S. Wilson.
By virtue of the authority in me
vested as president of the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, 1 do hereby ac
cept the foregoing grant upon the
trusts therein set forth.
S. F. Leib.
As President of the Hoard of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University.
San Francisco, Cal., December 9,
1901.
The undersigned members of the
board of trustees of the Leland
Stanford Junior University do
hesehy accept the within grant for
ourselves and for the other mem
bers of said board, upon the trusts
therein set forth.
Timothy Hopkins,
Charles 1). Lathrop,
S. F. Leib."
There are fifteen trustees in all —
twelve in addition to those who af
fixed their signatures yesterday—
Henry L. Dodge, Horace Davis, Su
preme Judge Thomas 15. McFar
land, George E. Gray, Joseph 1).
Grant, Leon Sloss, Russell J. Wil
son, of San Francisco; Nathan W.
Spaulding of Oakland, United
States Senator William M. Stewart
of Carson, Nevada; Rev. Dr. Hora
tio Stebbins of Cambridge*, Mass.;
Thomas Welton Stanford of Mel
bourne, Australia; and Frank Mil
ler of Sacramento. This is the
legal body of men to whom the
great $80,000,000 gift is intrust
ed to be formally protected by
them and by their successors, most
of whom will eventually be gradu
ates of the University.
Hut while Mrs. Stanford has
made this an absolute gift, she still
retains by provisions of the consti
tutional amendment of the State
and by endowment rights the pow
er of surviving founder if she cares
to execute the function during her

lifetime. Large an the gift is to
the }>u I>l ic of California, Mrs. Stan
ford still It<iB several millions in re
serve for the future remembrance of
various distant relatives, and per
haps for further enrichment of the
University.
The deed of gift covers bonds and
stocks previously given and certain
securities not included in former
grants. It also includes a large
amount of property that has been
created during the last six years
by the immense productiveness of
some of the income properties. The
grants are largely confirmatory in
character, and are made in con
formance with the provisions of the
new Stanford University amend
ment to the State Constitution,
specially passed to enable Stanford
to secure title to what it had nomi
nally been given, and to receive in
the most secure legal form the prop
erty intended for it.
The result is that today Stanford
University is the richest endowed
institution of learning in the whole
world. The properties thus given
to the University are enumerated
as follows:
Interest-bearing stocks and bonds
of highest class, conservatively ap
praised at $ 18,000,000, and mostly
bought with following estimated
possessions of two years ago: 285,-
000 shares Southern Pacific stock
at $40 a share, $11,400,000; 10,000
shares Central Pacific stock at $25
a share, $250,000; 10,000 shares
Central Pacific stock at $57 a share.
$570,000; Market-street Railway
stock, $1,500,000; one-fourth inter
est in Pacific Improvement Com
pany, $7,000,000; total, $20,720,-
000.'

aggregating about 100,000 acres of
land, valued at $12,000,000; Vina

cultural place; Gridley ranch,
Butte county, 22,000 acres, largest

It costs considerably more than
$1000 a day to run Stanford Uni
versity. There are approximately
1400 students in constant attend
ance, almost 500 of them women,
and more than one-third of all
these students come from outside
of the State of California, from
other states and foreign countries.
There are 150 professors and other
teachers.
Stanford University has the larg
est endowment of any college in
the world; it has one of the high
est paid presidents, Dr. Jordan re
ceiving $10,000 a year; it has
