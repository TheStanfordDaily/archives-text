# Gymnasium Work for Outsiders.
## 
### 
During the present semester ;i
few I'alo Alto grammar and high
school boys have been admitted to
the Encina gymnasium. The in
creasing mini her of applications for
such accommodations has made it
seem advisable to set aside a special
hour in which Palo Alto boys may
be cared for. The hour from 4to 5
on Monday, Wednesday, and Fri
day will he used for this purpose
next semester.
This is not to he construed as
limiting that class to the younger
hoys. The same system of section
organization operating for the reg
ular college students will he ex
tended to these boys. For each
group of three there will he a
leader appointed from those stu
dents enrol led in Hygiene 12.
Those leaders who intend to
teach after leaving school, will find
here an opportunity to gain some
more experience which may he of
use to them in their professional
work.
