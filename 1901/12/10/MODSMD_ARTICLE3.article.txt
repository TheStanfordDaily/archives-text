Stanford are superfluous from stu
dents of the University. Ky her act
yesterday she confirmed the most
munificent, gift ever made to educa
tion, and we are the beneficiaries.
None of us will realize the devo
tion, patience, wisdom and forti
tude of this woman who has con
tended against what nearly every
one else believed were insurmount
able obstacles. And now, after
years of labor to this end, she has
signed the final deeds which make
Stanford University the most rich
ly endowed institution in the world.
Without cost to ourselves and with
out expense to the State, we receive
the instruction and enjoy the facili
ties placed at our disposal. Not by

is devoting the closing years of her
life to the carrying out of the plans
of her husband, which will perpetu

world; it is our duty and privilege
to contribute to the honor of that
