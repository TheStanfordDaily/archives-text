Interest seems to be steadily in
creasing in the coming game at
Pasadena, and a considerable num
ber of men have begun the train
ing work preparatory to the con
test. Last night over a score of
players were put through vigorous
signal practice and exercise in get
ting down the field quickly on punts
from back of the line. Jt is be
lieved t hat the statement made a few
days ago in regard to the men who
will be taken, is not yet fully un
derstood. Captain Fisher said
very definitely that, while the men

who entered the big game last No
vember would he given the first
chance for places on this team, the
endeavor of those in authority
would he to send their strongest
possible eleven to meet Michigan.
So it will be seen that nearly any
one who will come out, has a fair
chance to make one of the twenty
who go South.
It is understood that Frank Sla
ker will be putin as one half,
while Fisher and Hill will un
doubtedly have the other position.
Good men, however, who have fine
halfback ability, are Naramoreand
Parker, and both may have a
chance here and at fullback. Of
the ends alreadyjout, Cooper, Clark,
I'reston, and McGilvray are con
sidered to have a good chance for
the ends. Thompson and Barn
hisel were played at guard last
night, McFadden and Roosevelt at
tackle, and Hauverman at center.
