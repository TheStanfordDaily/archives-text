# VIEWS OF JAPAN.
## President Jordan Tells Interesting Facts About the Island Empire. 
### 
In the Assembly Hall last even
ing President Jordan told interest
ing facts about Japan and made
passing comments on more than
one hundred lantern slides selected
from a collection of five hundred
beautiful views of the island em
pire. The pictures were of city an 1
country, coast and islands, groves
and parks, people and institutions,
and points of historic interest from
all parts of Japan. Nearly every
one gave the speaker an opportun
ity to describe some custom of the
people, or some peculiarity of the
country. Carpenters, coopers, fish
ermen, wrestlers and members of
various trades were shown at their
work; the entire series, with the
expositions accompanying, made
the hour seem like a rapid tour over
the island itself.
Describing the native hotels,
President Jordan said they were
all one story high, with tile roofs;
inside there are no tables, no chairs,
and no beds. The floors are smooth,
covered with matting, and, as
people sit on the floor to eat, furni
ture is not needed. It is one of the
greatest possible insults to wear
ones shoes into a Japanese house.
Every house has a garden; those
belonging to the rich are very large
and beautiful, while some of those
maintained by the poorer people
may be no larger than a tray two
feet square which, nevertheless,
have all the attributes of a minia
ture garden.
There are two distinct classes
in Japan, the type of the lower one
being marked by a broad face,
while that of the aristocratic is in
dicated by a longer face. A young
woman is known to be unmarried
by a crease in her garment over
the shoulder, which is taken out
when she becomes a wife. The
most charming thing in the whole
country is the little girl. This year
the first opportunity for the higher
education of women was given by
the opening of a female college in
Tokyo. The curriculum of the in
stitution is not equal to an ordi
nary high school, but it marks a de
cided advance, for one of the chief
needs of Japan is the education of
women.

In the Assembly Hall last even
ing President Jordan told interest
ing facts about Japan and made
passing comments on more than
one hundred lantern slides selected
from a collection of five hundred
beautiful views of the island em
pire. The pictures were of city an 1
country, coast and islands, groves
and parks, people and institutions,
and points of historic interest from
all parts of Japan. Nearly every
one gave the speaker an opportun
ity to describe some custom of the
people, or some peculiarity of the
country. Carpenters, coopers, fish
ermen, wrestlers and members of
various trades were shown at their
work; the entire series, with the
expositions accompanying, made
the hour seem like a rapid tour over
the island itself.
Describing the native hotels,
President Jordan said they were
all one story high, with tile roofs;
inside there are no tables, no chairs,
and no beds. The floors are smooth,
covered with matting, and, as
people sit on the floor to eat, furni
ture is not needed. It is one of the
greatest possible insults to wear
ones shoes into a Japanese house.
Every house has a garden; those
belonging to the rich are very large
and beautiful, while some of those
maintained by the poorer people
may be no larger than a tray two
feet square which, nevertheless,
have all the attributes of a minia
ture garden.
There are two distinct classes
in Japan, the type of the lower one
being marked by a broad face,
while that of the aristocratic is in
dicated by a longer face. A young
woman is known to be unmarried
by a crease in her garment over
the shoulder, which is taken out
when she becomes a wife. The
most charming thing in the whole
country is the little girl. This year
the first opportunity for the higher
education of women was given by
the opening of a female college in
Tokyo. The curriculum of the in
stitution is not equal to an ordi
nary high school, but it marks a de
cided advance, for one of the chief
needs of Japan is the education of
women.
