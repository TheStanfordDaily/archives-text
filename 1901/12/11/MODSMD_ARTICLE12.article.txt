Michigan, if we are to judge by
the comments which are quoted to
day from the Daily News, is confi
dent of her ability to defeat any
Western aggregation of players. She
has some excuse for this self-assur
ance, as no university has ever
ended a season of football with such
a good record. But Michigan is not
invincible. She has not met any
first-class team, and Northwestern
is the only university with which
she has contested that claims to be
even second class. Nevertheless
she does have a phenomenal record.
Just three weeks from today
Stanford will meet this team, which
claims the championship of the Mid
dle West, on a Western gridiron.
To no game within the past two
years was attached so much general
importance as will be felt for the
outcome of this contest. Michigan
knows nothing hut success. She
has a reputation to sustain, and is
quite confident of the result of the
coming struggle. Stanford has none
of I lie above, hut she has tasted de
feat, she has missed the chance of a
reputation, and knows the had ef
fects of over-confidence. The im
portance, therefore, to Stanford and
to Western football of the New
Year's game can not he over-esti
mated. For some reason most of the
football men do not realize the re
sponsibility which they have ac
cepted with the Michigan challenge.
They are apparently indifferent as
to suffering a defeat or to winning
a victory. As a matter of fact, the
general feeling of the football men
seems to be that victory is impossi
ble. Such being the case the game
would better be called off than that
the Cardinal should be trailed in
the dust without a proper defense.
