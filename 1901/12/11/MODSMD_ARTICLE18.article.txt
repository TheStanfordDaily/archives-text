# The Handball Belt.
## 
### 
Last year, when the success of tho
handball tournament became as
sured, Mr. Storey offered a belt to
the winner. W. F. Dunn, '04, won
the trophy, with 8. P. Frisselle, '03,
second, iiereafter the belt will be
competed for each year, the winner
being entitled to wear it during the
year which he was successful, ihe
belt is of hand-carved leather
mounted with silver. On one plate
is engraved '!Encina Gymnasium,"
on the opposite "Handball Tourna
ment." It is provided with six
places for plates engraved with the
name of the winner and his year.
When the belt is filled it will be
placed in the trophy room in En
cina Hall, and a similar one offered
for future contests.
The tournament for the belt will
probably be held early next se
mester.
