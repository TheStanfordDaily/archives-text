Baseball Captain Dave Cowden
received a letter today from It. B.
Ball, '03, last year's Varsity catch
er, saying that he had seen ac
counts in the Daily Palo Alto of
the fall training done here by the
baseball men, and that if Cowden
thought there was any chance for
him to make the team as catcher
or fielder he fell much like return
ing in January. He is at present
at Williams, Arizona. Among the
candidates for the position of
catcher who are out so far no one
has yet displayed form in any way
up to that of the Varsity man, Ball.
He is accurate, steady, and quick,
and his work ranks high, even
when compared with professionals.
Cowden will write urging him to
come if he can possibly leave his
work in Arizona, and it is inferred
from his letter that Ball will be
here by the first of the year.
