# "The Eternal Life."

Dr. O. L. Elliott gave the chapel
sermon on Sunday morning, with
"The Eternal Life" as his topic.
"The rich young man who came
to Christ and asked how he might
obtain eternal life did not expect
to be told that he must alter or give
up entirely |he pleasant life
which he was then leading. This
command was misinterpreted by
the faithful ascetics, who surren
dered all the worth of their present
lives in bartering for future happi
ness. Today religion has entered
upon its true inheritance and is
vitally devoted to the improvement
of the world; the future life is
viewed more rationally as a direct
step from the present. The modern
stoicism accepts decay and death
as normal changes, and is not dis
couraged even by the thought that
man has but one life. The Chris
tian religion, without an insight
into metaphysical problems, teaches
of a universal love and a universal
God. The eternal life which
Christ promised the young ruler
was not a vague reward after death,
but an immediate happiness. Un
selfish life, confidence in the integ
rity of Christ, are the intelligible
qualities of 'the life eternal.'"
