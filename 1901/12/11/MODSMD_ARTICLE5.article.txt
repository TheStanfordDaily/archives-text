# ITINERARY OF MUSICAL CLUBS
## Men Who Will Go South With the Organizations During Holidays. 
### 
Advance-agent F. W. Morrison,
Stanford, '96. has been in the south
for-the last few days arranging the
schedule for the holiday trip of the
musical clubs. He has met with
success so far in arranging dates in
the lower part of the State, but it
seems probably that Modesto and
Merced will be the only two towns
in the San Joaquin Valley to be
visited. It has been impossible for
Morrison to get halls in Stockton
and Fresno; and in addition Bakers
field and Visalia, which have al
ways heretofore been visited by the
clubs, will not have concerts this
year.
The combined clubs, numbering
either twenty-four or twenty-six
men, will leave the University on
the 20th of December, playing in
Modesto that night. Merced will
have the clubs on the 21st. From
Merced the men will go direct to
Los Angeles, playing there on the
night of the 23d. On the 24th
San Diego will be visited, and on
Christmas night the usual concert
will be given at the Motel Coronado.
The return from San Diego will be
on the new Coast line, and the
following towns around Los An
geles will receive dates: Santa Ana,
Redlands, Riverside, San Bernar
dino and Ontario. On the night of
December 31st the clubs will give
another concert at Los Angeles
under the auspices of the \Vomens'
Club, and on New Year's night,
the day of the big game between
the University of Michigan and
Stanford, they will play at Pasa
dena. Returning, the following
towns will be visited and given
concerts: Ventura, Santa Barbara,
Monterey, Santa Cruz, Salinas and
San Luis Obispo. The latter town
will he visited on January 10th or
11th, and that will make it possi
ble for the men to return to the
University on the 11th or 12th of
January. Mr. Morrison is now in
Bos Angeles, and until his return
it will be impossible to give the ex
act dates where they are not above
given. The towns will be visited,
however, in the order as named.
The men who are to compose the
musical clubs in the coming trip to
Southern California have finally
been selected by the joint executive
committee of the Mandolin and
Glee Clubs, composed of 11. L. Mor
rison, R. J. Keith and A. J. Copp,
Jr., for the Mandolin Club, and L.
C. Haw ley, W. F. Whitaker, A. Per
