### 
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford left for
the East last night. Her destina
tion is New York. The trip, which
is made on private business, was
planned some time ago, but was de
layed by leg;il matters connected
with yesterday's transfer of prop
erty to the University. The so
journ in New York will lie brief, as
Mrs. Stanford is anxious to watch
the progress of the new buildings
that are being erected at the Uni
versity. â€”Chronicle.
