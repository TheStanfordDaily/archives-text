The following comments from
the Michigan Daily News explain
themselves. In the discussion of
Michigan's proposal for a game is
this extract:
" However, when the time came,
both Stanford and California de
clined to meet Michigan. Only
one conclusion can be drawn from
their action —that they are afraid
to meet the Yellow and Blue —for
the difficulty of finances is entirely
eliminated by the Pasadena Tour
nament of lioses Association.
"Those California teams seem to
be somewhat tired of football for
this year. They would be rather
more so if they ever played Michi
gan."
And again: " Handball isquitea
fad in the West. Universities
which find football a dismal fail
ure, sometimes make a success of
the milder game."
