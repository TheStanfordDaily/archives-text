# INTERCOLLEGIATE AGREEMENT
## Positions in the Carnot Debate Will be Assigned a Month Beforehand. 
### 
The Faculty Committee on liter
ary contests of the University of
California has agreed with the Fac
ulty Committee at Stanford to al
low the positions of the speakers in
the Carnot debate to be assigned a
month before the contest. This
agreement is made as an experiment
and will- hold for this year only.
The Carnot debate has been sup
posed to be extemporaneous. It
lias been the idea of the two faculty
committees to have it the opposite
of the regular intercollegiate con
test, hut the method has proved un
satisfactory. Heretofore the gen
eral field which the debate was to
cover has been announced to the
contestants two months beforehand,
and then narrowed down a month
later. The questions were not
given out until two weeks, and
sides and positions only twenty
four hours before the time
for the debate. 'This resulted in all
the debaters learning four speeches,
a negative and an affirmative
answer to the question, and a re
buttal for each side, which neces
sitated a great amount of extra
work in preparation, forestalling
all attempts to make the contest
extemporaneous as was intended.
