Till': Intersociety Debating League
gives notice that all who wish to
enter tJie preliminaries for the Cal
ifornia or Washington intercollegi
ate debates must hand in their
mi ines to members of the committee
by next Monday. There should be
a large number of entries for these
debates, Both are of great import
ance to Stanford. The question
whether this University can put
out two winning teams should be
answered in the affirmative before
the end of the year by the clinching
evidence of two victories on the
rostrum. There should he little
difference in the quality of the
two teams. The best team, com
posed of the best debaters, will, of
course, meet Berkeley. But the
second best, which will oppose the
debaters of the University of Wash
ington for the tirst time, should be
of equal calibre and ability. This
result can only be attained by the
careful selection of best men from a
large number of contestants.
It would be an excellent thing
for debating if all the prominent
and strong men of the institution
—the men who have taken an act
ive interest in our undergraduate
activities and who are managing
and conducting those affairs now,
the leading men in all branches of
our student association —would en
ter these preliminary debates. It
would lend to competition a tone
and excellence never heretofore at
tained. Although these men may
not be members of literary societies
they are mostly men of ability who
have original ideas and original
ways of expressing them. What
is needed is a strong representative
body of debaters; and such teams

could easily be selected if every
student who can would enter the
preliminaries, even though his
chances of making the finals were
slight.
