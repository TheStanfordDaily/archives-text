# E.W. MOULTON ON GYMNASIUM.
## Experienced Trainer Discusses Plans for the Proper Conditioning of Our Athletes. 
### 
Trainer E. \V. Moulton has taken
considerable interest in the articles
on the gymnasium which have ap
peared in the Palo Alto columns.
There is ha rdly a man in the United
States who is more competent to
judge of the needs of athletes than
lie. He is thoroughly familiar
with every kind of physical exer
cise, as be has cared for and con
ditioned thousands of men in his
time. He has visited and studied
the gymnasiums of every institu
tion of any size in the United States,
and his views on the subject will
be of interest. Moulton does not
favor the training-house movement,
because,as he says, a well-equipped
gymnasium will have all the facili
ties, and supply all the needs, of a
training-house.
He says: ''I have visited a great
many gymnasiums, and for all
round work consider the one at
Notre Dame, Ind., one of the best.
Although the gymnasium depart
ment is not the largest or best
equipped in America, it is lirst
class. The building itself is perfect,
and as it is not crowded, serves all
branches of athletics. In the front
part of the building on the ground
floor are the training quarters,
baths, rubbing-rooms, dry-room
and manager's office. Above is the
physical culture department or
gymnasium proper. Back of this
is a large unobstructed ground-floor
space called the track-room. It
also serves for baseball and foot
ball practice. 'Jhe interior dimen
sions of this part of the building
are approximately 100x180 feet. The
roof is supported by twelve great
iron trusses, thus doing away with
the customary pillars. The indoor
field is therefore unique, the in
closed area being so well suited to
the various sports. There is not for
all practical purposes a better gym
nasium in America, and the win
ning teams turned out there go to
prove this. Weather cannot inter
fere with training. A dirt floor
and track are advantageous for the
proper conditioning of contestants.
The gymnasium instructor uses the
dirt track for his men and finds it
far preferable, and less lameness is
found among his men than there
would be if he had a board, canvas
or rubber-covered track. In an
inclosure of this size a 12-lap track
can be made, nine feet wide, with a
30-yard straightaway finish, leav
ing ample room in the center of the
track for pole-vaulting, high jump
ing, shot-put, and a 40 or 50 yard
straight away sprinting course. A
gallery runs across the entire width
of the building, reached by stairs
on each side of the main entrance.
The space inside is large enough for
baseball practice and football sig
nal work.
The question at Stanford seems
to be, Must baseball, football, and
track men have a separate train
ing-house? The gymnasium should
be large, with ainple dressing-rooms,
dry-room, baths, plunge, offices for
gymnasium instructor and for the
manager and treasurer of athletics.
Many advantages are gained by

coin billing them in one. There
should he a dry-room for damp
football suits, and ample baths, j
Almost every gymnasium in the I
Middle Went has made mistakes in j
the size and construction of baths,'
and often has had to rebuild them.)
Too much care cannot be taken in j
that one particular, iis it is import
ant. I find this climate rather try-1
ing for athletes, for when one is
warm or perspiring after work he!
finds the air cold and, especially if j
cloudy, very chilly, making it easy
to take cold. The indoor track here j
for at least three months in the
year would do away, not only with
danger of colds, but also the en
forced idleness on account of in
clement weather. Ann' lay-off on
account of a bad track, or any other
reason, helps to make our athlete
careless in his work The question
of athletics in colleges has been
settled long since, and hy wiser
heads than mine. So I presume
that athletics will be kept up here,
and 1 go on the principle that
whatever is worth doing at all is
worth doing well.
With the right kind of a gymna
sium, indoor and outdoor fields,
and the enforcement of strict train
ing rules we are bound to raise ath
letics toa high standard. I do not
understand why young men cannot
see that training rules closely fol
lowed are for thier welfare, not only
for the time being but for life, as
habits formed while young cling
through life. I think that one de
rives lots of pleasure in keeping
rules and knowing that he is on his
honor and faithful to the cause.
I hope to see a fine athletic field
here and would be glad to give any
suggestions in regard to the con
struction of the track. I putin
the tracks at the University of Wis
consin and at the University of
Nortre Dame, which are considered
good tracks, i also assisted in the
construction of a cinder-path track
at Manchester, England, and one
near A in tree, Liverpool. 1 may
not. be here when the field and
tracks are made, but I hope they
will look well to it that the track is
so constructed that weather con
ditions will not interfere with
training; that the football field is
either of grass or dirt* that can he
loosened up and made softer than
our field this fall. Good tackling
can scarcely be taught on a field as
hard as a rock bed. To this con
dition of the field may be attri
buted many bad sprains and some
broken bones.
Again I will return to the subject
of the dressing-rooms. 1 think that
with large, light, and warm dress
ing rooms and baths the athlete will
get through practice and return to
his work sooner and much more
cheerfully than when he dresses
here and there and everywhere.
Besides, all can be properly taken
care of by the trainers and rubbers.
A football team should be together
as much as possible. :is better team
work lias been done by men more
closely associated.
As this may be the last time
your papers may give me space, 1
would like to take this occasion to
thank Mr. Storey for bis willing as
sistance in track work in allowing
us to pick and choose from his best

men. 1 think he will quite agree
with me on my views of the gym
nasium as 1 have given "themâ€”at
least 1 hope so.
1 will also take this occasion to
answer a question asked me every
day, "What are our track team
prospects?" They are good, but
you can make them better by com
ing out and taking a hand your
self. Yours respectfully,
E. W. Moulton.

through life. I think that one de
rives lots of pleasure in keeping
rules and knowing that he is on his
honor and faithful to the cause.
I hope to see a fine athletic field
here and would be glad to give any
suggestions in regard to the con
struction of the track. I putin
the tracks at the University of Wis
consin and at the University of
Nortre Dame, which are considered
good tracks, i also assisted in the
construction of a cinder-path track
at Manchester, England, and one
near A in tree, Liverpool. 1 may
not. be here when the field and
tracks are made, but I hope they
will look well to it that the track is
so constructed that weather con
ditions will not interfere with
training; that the football field is
either of grass or dirt* that can he
loosened up and made softer than
our field this fall. Good tackling
can scarcely be taught on a field as
hard as a rock bed. To this con
dition of the field may be attri
buted many bad sprains and some
broken bones.
Again I will return to the subject
of the dressing-rooms. 1 think that
with large, light, and warm dress
ing rooms and baths the athlete will
get through practice and return to
his work sooner and much more
cheerfully than when he dresses
here and there and everywhere.
Besides, all can be properly taken
care of by the trainers and rubbers.
A football team should be together
as much as possible. :is better team
work lias been done by men more
closely associated.
As this may be the last time
your papers may give me space, 1
would like to take this occasion to
thank Mr. Storey for bis willing as
sistance in track work in allowing
us to pick and choose from his best

men. 1 think he will quite agree
with me on my views of the gym
nasium as 1 have given "themâ€”at
least 1 hope so.
1 will also take this occasion to
answer a question asked me every
day, "What are our track team
prospects?" They are good, but
you can make them better by com
ing out and taking a hand your
self. Yours respectfully,
E. W. Moulton.
Trainer E. \V. Moulton has taken
considerable interest in the articles
on the gymnasium which have ap
peared in the Palo Alto columns.
There is ha rdly a man in the United
States who is more competent to
judge of the needs of athletes than
lie. He is thoroughly familiar
with every kind of physical exer
cise, as be has cared for and con
ditioned thousands of men in his
time. He has visited and studied
the gymnasiums of every institu
tion of any size in the United States,
and his views on the subject will
be of interest. Moulton does not
favor the training-house movement,
because,as he says, a well-equipped
gymnasium will have all the facili
ties, and supply all the needs, of a
training-house.
He says: ''I have visited a great
many gymnasiums, and for all
round work consider the one at
Notre Dame, Ind., one of the best.
Although the gymnasium depart
ment is not the largest or best
equipped in America, it is lirst
class. The building itself is perfect,
and as it is not crowded, serves all
branches of athletics. In the front
part of the building on the ground
floor are the training quarters,
baths, rubbing-rooms, dry-room
and manager's office. Above is the
physical culture department or
gymnasium proper. Back of this
is a large unobstructed ground-floor
space called the track-room. It
also serves for baseball and foot
ball practice. 'Jhe interior dimen
sions of this part of the building
are approximately 100x180 feet. The
roof is supported by twelve great
iron trusses, thus doing away with
the customary pillars. The indoor
field is therefore unique, the in
closed area being so well suited to
the various sports. There is not for
all practical purposes a better gym
nasium in America, and the win
ning teams turned out there go to
prove this. Weather cannot inter
fere with training. A dirt floor
and track are advantageous for the
proper conditioning of contestants.
The gymnasium instructor uses the
dirt track for his men and finds it
far preferable, and less lameness is
found among his men than there
would be if he had a board, canvas
or rubber-covered track. In an
inclosure of this size a 12-lap track
can be made, nine feet wide, with a
30-yard straightaway finish, leav
ing ample room in the center of the
track for pole-vaulting, high jump
ing, shot-put, and a 40 or 50 yard
straight away sprinting course. A
gallery runs across the entire width
of the building, reached by stairs
on each side of the main entrance.
The space inside is large enough for
baseball practice and football sig
nal work.
The question at Stanford seems
to be, Must baseball, football, and
track men have a separate train
ing-house? The gymnasium should
be large, with ainple dressing-rooms,
dry-room, baths, plunge, offices for
gymnasium instructor and for the
manager and treasurer of athletics.
Many advantages are gained by

coin billing them in one. There
should he a dry-room for damp
football suits, and ample baths, j
Almost every gymnasium in the I
Middle Went has made mistakes in j
the size and construction of baths,'
and often has had to rebuild them.)
Too much care cannot be taken in j
that one particular, iis it is import
ant. I find this climate rather try-1
ing for athletes, for when one is
warm or perspiring after work he!
finds the air cold and, especially if j
cloudy, very chilly, making it easy
to take cold. The indoor track here j
for at least three months in the
year would do away, not only with
danger of colds, but also the en
forced idleness on account of in
clement weather. Ann' lay-off on
account of a bad track, or any other
reason, helps to make our athlete
careless in his work The question
of athletics in colleges has been
settled long since, and hy wiser
heads than mine. So I presume
that athletics will be kept up here,
and 1 go on the principle that
whatever is worth doing at all is
worth doing well.
With the right kind of a gymna
sium, indoor and outdoor fields,
and the enforcement of strict train
ing rules we are bound to raise ath
letics toa high standard. I do not
understand why young men cannot
see that training rules closely fol
lowed are for thier welfare, not only
for the time being but for life, as
habits formed while young cling
through life. I think that one de
rives lots of pleasure in keeping
