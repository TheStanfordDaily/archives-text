# STANFORD STORY.
## Seattle Newspaper Man Touches on Western Student Life. 
### 
A recent number of the Saturday
Evening Post publishes a story by
Joseph Blethen, entitled "The Run
of the lied Salmon," in which the
hero, Harvey Alden, a young man
who has prepared for Harvard, is
induced by an older brother to
postpone his entrance to college for
a year and to share with him a
business venture on Puget Sound.
They putin a fish-trap, which
proved wonderfully successful, for
they hit upon a good location and
the run of the salmon was enor
mous that year. It had been a
struggle for young Alden to aban
don going directly from the prepar
atory school with his associates to
Harvard. During the fall, how
ever, after his arrival on the Coast,
he made a trip to Stanford in com
pany with a number of alumni,
and saw the big football game in
San Francisco. He was fascinated
by the University, and instead of
entering Harvard the following
year he became a student at Stan
ford. The passage in the story
which describes Harvey's visit to
the University reads:
"Taking the train with his elder
comrades at San Francisco, Harvey
went for the first time on that
forty-mile dash down the Santa
Clara Valley to Palo Alto. The
November fog was left behind, and
the November sun of the California
paradise struck a deep red glint on
the tiling where Stanford roofs
spread above their spacious quad
rangle. From the train the alumni,
with Harvey tucked in their midst,
marched up the long avenue to the
arch, with a rich, black soil be
neath their feet, two lines of trop
ical palms on either hand, and a
soft blue above them. While the
returning pilgrims cheered and
sang and waved their cardinal
with the abandon of favorite chil
dren returned to their own, Harvey
looked at the wonders about him,
and asked why he had not known
this before.
"Through the two days that fol
lowed, Harvey was an adopted
child of the red-topped principal
ity, and royally did he wave his
borrowed cardinal. From the won
ders of the University itself, with
its every evidence of wealth, he
followed the masses to the gridiron
and cheered the Cardinal team
through all that afternoon of San
Francisco fog. When Stanford
won, he was juhliant with the
older enthusiast." At the close,
when Harvey's brother tells him he
may go back to Harvard, the story
says:
"Hut somehow the glint, of the
sun on a red-tiled roof had gotten
into the boy's heart. Jie took his
cardinal flag with its white "S" to
a Stanford girl, and she embroid
ered a cardinal salmon across its
base. That's how Harvey Alden
came to be called 'The Red Sal
mon' at Stanford."
Mr. Blethen, who is managing
editor of the Seattle Times, has
written a number of stories, among
the most notable being "The Four
teenth Man," published in the La
dies Home Journal a year ago. He
visited Stanford last January, when
his sisters, the Misses Blethen,
were students at Castilleja.
