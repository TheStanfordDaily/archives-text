# STUDENT ACTIVITIES.
## Statistics Showing How the Undergraduates Spend Their Leisure Hours. 
### 
An article which is of consider
able interest to the college world is
"Some Statistics of Student Activi
ties" in the November Era. The
subject of what students do with
their time outside of their studies
is taken up; and by means of fig
ures is shown the relative import
ance of the various branches of
student affairs and where the in
terest in each centres. The writer
took as his basis the 1728 men
undergraduates of the collegiate
year 1900-1901 who spent the year
or the greater part of it at Ithaca.
Of these 556 were found to be mem
bers of fraternities, and 1172 non
fraternity men. There were 615
freshmen, 418 sophomores, 354
juniors, and 341 seniors. These
were catalogued according to all the
branches of activity with which
they were connected, crediting to
each branch not only those actually
on the teams or staffs or in clubs,
but also those actively striving for
places. The results were given in
two tables of figures which are re
produced here:

year, where there is an abrupt drop.
The lack of opportunity for coin
petition in Ihe last year is undoubt
edly responsible for this change.
The figures for journalism exhibit
the same trend, probably for the
same reason. Athletics shows
throughout the course a decreasing
tendency, and debating and dra
matics the reverse. In general the
fraternity men are much 11 ore ac
tive in proportion to their numbers
than the independents. This holds
good in each particular case except
debating and chess, the former of
which is almost wholly a non-fra
ternity affair."

In the first table, it will be seen,
the compiler gives the total number
of students connected with each
branch and the percentage of the
whole body of students so con
nected, also the number of fratern
ity and non-fraternity men in each
and the precentage of their entire
number. The second table gives
the number and proportion of each
class interested. The most signif
icant fact shown by the figures is
| that with all the multitude of clubs,
teams, and publications at Cornell,
not thirty-seven per cent, of the
students are actively associated
i with any of them. It is also notice

An article which is of consider
able interest to the college world is
"Some Statistics of Student Activi
ties" in the November Era. The
subject of what students do with
their time outside of their studies
is taken up; and by means of fig
ures is shown the relative import
ance of the various branches of
student affairs and where the in
terest in each centres. The writer
took as his basis the 1728 men
undergraduates of the collegiate
year 1900-1901 who spent the year
or the greater part of it at Ithaca.
Of these 556 were found to be mem
bers of fraternities, and 1172 non
fraternity men. There were 615
freshmen, 418 sophomores, 354
juniors, and 341 seniors. These
were catalogued according to all the
branches of activity with which
they were connected, crediting to
each branch not only those actually
on the teams or staffs or in clubs,
but also those actively striving for
places. The results were given in
two tables of figures which are re
produced here:

year, where there is an abrupt drop.
The lack of opportunity for coin
petition in Ihe last year is undoubt
edly responsible for this change.
The figures for journalism exhibit
the same trend, probably for the
same reason. Athletics shows
throughout the course a decreasing
tendency, and debating and dra
matics the reverse. In general the
fraternity men are much 11 ore ac
tive in proportion to their numbers
than the independents. This holds
good in each particular case except
debating and chess, the former of
which is almost wholly a non-fra
ternity affair."

In the first table, it will be seen,
the compiler gives the total number
of students connected with each
branch and the percentage of the
whole body of students so con
nected, also the number of fratern
ity and non-fraternity men in each
and the precentage of their entire
number. The second table gives
the number and proportion of each
class interested. The most signif
icant fact shown by the figures is
| that with all the multitude of clubs,
teams, and publications at Cornell,
not thirty-seven per cent, of the
students are actively associated
i with any of them. It is also notice
! able that nearly two-thirds are con
nected with athletics.
