It is with peculiar pleasure that
the Daily Palo Alto extends con
gratulations, first, to Itoger J. Ster
rett, because he has demonstrated
signal ability in writing the story
that captured the Post prize"; second,
to the University, because in open
competition a Stanford man has
done a better piece of work than
could be turned out by our rivals
at Berkeley. Local writers have in
the past achieved successes that are
little short of amazing to him who
knows of the youth of the institu
tion, and not of the kind of men
and women who came here; to whom
the sanity that prevails in the
Stanford method of teaching the
native tongue is an unknown
quantity. It seems that these suc
cesses are to continue. It is by such
achievements as these that the
University secures the kind of repu
tation that helps it, and any stu
dent who contributes is doing as
much for Stanford as for himself.
