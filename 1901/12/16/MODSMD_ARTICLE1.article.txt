# REPORT OF INN COMMITTEE
## By-Laws of the Stanford University Inn Club. 
### 
Saturday there were deposited
with Keesling & Mackenzie, attor
neys-at-law, papers for the incor
poration of the Stanford University
inn Cluh under the laws of the
State of California.
In order lo incorporate it was
necessary that certain preliminaries
and sound steps he gone through
with. These steps were taken last
Thursday night hy fourteen men
who met in one of the Encina
rooms. They were as follows:
Election of temporary chairman
and secretary, adoption of hy-laws,
and election of Board of Directors.
This action in itself seems some
what arbitrary, hut it is to be under
stood that the organization which
was effected Thursday night isonly
temporary, and the Board of Direct
ors were elected largely to comply
with the law, and to establish an
authoritative basis for fuller organ
ization. The directors elected will
serve for only a few days, since by
Art. IX., Sec. 1 of the by-laws, the
regular annual election of directors
will occur the -16th of January,
when all the men who are then
members of the Inn Club may ex
ercise their privilege of choice. The
present directors as elected are
Lloyd E. Harter president, Carl F.
Dittmar secretary-treasurer, Carl
Hayden, Chas. A. Cantwell, M. F.
McCormick.
The by-laws which follow do not
cover all the points connected with
the control and management of the
Inn, except in a general way. The
details will be gone into in the con
tracts with caterer and accountant,
and in the rules and regulations
which will be drawn up to regulate
the employees and the use of dining
privileges.
It is not thought necessary to
publish the articles of incorpora
tion, Bince there is nothing in them
that is of interest or particular im
portance to the members. Any
one so wishing, however, may see a
copy of the articles, which are in
the hands of the president. It
should be explained that by the ad
vice of Mr. Keesling, '98, and the
advantage to be gained in obviating
some technical difliculties arising
through the handling of shares, the
incorporation was made as an asso
ciation without capital, but a mem
bership fee will be charged. This
is the plan upon which the Bohe
mian Club and similar institutions
of San Francisco are organized.
In order to open the dining-room
at the beginning of next semester,
it. will be necessary to have some
money on hand. It is very essen
tial to the successful opening that
every man who intends going into
the Club pay his membership fee
this semester.
