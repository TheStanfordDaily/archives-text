# Yost aâ€™ " Stanford Man."
## 
### 
The following is from a letter
written by Coach Yost to the San
Francisco ('/> rou icle:
" I was very anxious for a game
with the University of California,
but it would not play. The trip is
a very long and hard one for our
men to make, but I think we shall
be in fairly good shape. I was
much disappointed over Stanford's
being defeated. I. cannot see how
it could happen. I do not expect
to win from Stanford by a large
score, but shall be satisfied with
6-0 under the conditions. 1 must
admit that I love California and
California people. L shall always
believe, though, that 1 was cut out
for a Stanford man."
