Although the report for Novem
ber is not the lust one of the se
mester, and although most of the
accounts for the football season are
not settled until December, it may
be well to give here a short resume
of expense and receipts of the foot
ball season for 1901.
The gross gate receipts of football
games for this year amount to
$13,379 as against $13,080 for 1900.
The net receipts of the Varsity in
tercollegiate game this year are
nearly $3,000 less than last year.
The cost of coaches, trainers, etc.,
is practically the same this year as
last. A saving has been made in
the season, which was three weeks
shorter. Again the games in Los
Angeles in November netted the
student body in the neighborhood
of $1000, and the show given at the
Grand Opera House November 9th
brought in (including the seats for
the team) $500. The great loss for
the season has been in the four pre
liminary games with the Reliance
and Olympic teams. The net re
ceipts for each game have fallen
short between $150 and $200 of the
guarantee demanded by the ath
letic clubs.
After the amount set aside for
the Training-House Fund is paid
there will remain about $1500 to
carry on next semester's athletics,
as against $1,800 for last year.
The student body assessments
for this year are nearly $200 less
than the amount received by the
treasurer hist year. As all the as
sessments go to the Training-House
Fund there is no reason why twice
the amount realized is not received.

Treasurer.

Although the report for Novem
ber is not the lust one of the se
mester, and although most of the
accounts for the football season are
not settled until December, it may
be well to give here a short resume
of expense and receipts of the foot
ball season for 1901.
The gross gate receipts of football
games for this year amount to
$13,379 as against $13,080 for 1900.
The net receipts of the Varsity in
tercollegiate game this year are
nearly $3,000 less than last year.
The cost of coaches, trainers, etc.,
is practically the same this year as
last. A saving has been made in
the season, which was three weeks
shorter. Again the games in Los
Angeles in November netted the
student body in the neighborhood
of $1000, and the show given at the
Grand Opera House November 9th
brought in (including the seats for
the team) $500. The great loss for
the season has been in the four pre
liminary games with the Reliance
and Olympic teams. The net re
ceipts for each game have fallen
short between $150 and $200 of the
guarantee demanded by the ath
letic clubs.
After the amount set aside for
the Training-House Fund is paid
there will remain about $1500 to
carry on next semester's athletics,
as against $1,800 for last year.
The student body assessments
for this year are nearly $200 less
than the amount received by the
treasurer hist year. As all the as
sessments go to the Training-House
Fund there is no reason why twice
the amount realized is not received.
