# Dr. Dille's Address.
## 
### 
Sunday evening Dr. E. R. Dille,
pastor of the First Methodist
church, Oakland, gave the fourth
of the series of addresses by out
side speakers before the Christian
Association. He took for his theme
the Fatherhood of God, suggested
by the words "Our Father" as
found in the Lord's prayer. This
prayer is a model in its simplicity;
there is nothing in it that cannot
be understood by a child, and yet
it contains the essense of profound
philosophy. The calmness of the
petition is impressive; it cannot be
vociferated. Jesus did not start in
to prove the existence of God. lie
left that for the idiocy of the the
ologian. He did not create the
word of God; He illuminated it.
Christ was the first to utter the
idea in the words "Our Father."
He always spoke of the Deity as
Father. With infinite patience He
taught His disciples to know this
new conception, the brotherhood of
all men. Some people are impatient
because God's love is broader than
man's mind; because He is the God
of the heathen. Every heathen
who lives up to his light, as well as
a Christian lives up to his, will be
saved. While there is a God, if we
are immortal, we shall be his chil
dren. The Almighty does not love
us because Christ died for us, but
Christ died for us because God loved
us. It is a blasphemous conception
for a mother to tell her son that if
he is good God will love him, but
not if he is bad. The mother did
not get this from her own heart, for
she never ceases to love her child.
