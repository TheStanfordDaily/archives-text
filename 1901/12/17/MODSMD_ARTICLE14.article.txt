# CHRISTMAS SERMON.
## Professor Alden Speaks of the Significance and Meaning- of Christmas Time. 
### 
Christmas services were held in
the chapel Sunday. Professor Al
den, who delivered the sermon,
said in part:
"No one occasion brings such joy
to ihe world as does the dawn of
Christmas dav. For every class of
men it has its charm; lo children
il means a time of jollity and cele
bration, to many it means a time
of home coming and reunion, and
to others its chief significance is a
religious one.
"Christmas is even more varied
in its meaning to men of different
ages. (io hack a thousand years
and imagine a meeting «» f univer
sity students for the purpose of
celebrating the advent of Christ
mas. Such an assembly would
have had a background of ideas
far different from ours of today.
"Two conceptions of Christ have
come to affect our Christmas time
and to make it a better one than
that of a thousand years ago. The
first of these is the clearer painting
of the historical Christ, and the
knowledge that God is Christ-like.
Until modern times no history of
the life of Christ had been written.
Today we understand better the
character of Christ and through
him we understand God, not by
any spiritual mysticism, but by
the knowledge that his life repre
sents divine humanity. 'Ye who
have seen me, have seen the
Father.'
"The second great revelation by
Christ, which has been made clear
to us by the modern study of the
historical Christ, is that of univer
sal brotherhood. It was for the
nineteenth century to learn that
while Christ came to save individ
ual men, he did it not for their in
dividual sakes, but for humanity
as a whole.
"Our Christmas time is a better
one because these two ideas have
been added to it. This conception
of Christ will never leave us."
