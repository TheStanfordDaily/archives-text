# R. J. STERRETT'S STORY.
## The
						Christmas Tale Which Brought Stanford the Christmas Gift of a New Laurel-Leaf. 
### 
linger Sterrett's Christmas story
is distinctly a. story of Stanford;
not of the old Stanford with its
painted fences, its vineyards, and
its Maytield road, but of the new
Stanford with its massive archway,
its Memorial Chapel, and its great
organ.
In its nature it is a problem
story into which Stanford local
color, a romantic and dramatic ele
ment, and many touches of college
life are skilfully • introduced. Its
situation is that of a student called
home from college to "the nn
painted board shanties of the des
ert station of Yucca, with its fringe
of rusty tin cans, and its cactus
and white alkali wastes stretching
far into the colorless neutral gray
of a life without hope," there to
take a position as station master in
order to support the family of an
invalid brother.
His descriptions of the new
chapel are powerful. As the Sen
ior ponders over his telegram call s
ing him home, he loiters instinct
ively toward the quad where circu
lates the tide of the "youth and
hope" of which the University is
builded, and pauses before the
carved entrance of the Memorial
Chapel, "which rose into the gloom,
a huge stone mass, above which
the flying buttresses and turrets
carried the eye to the great tower
reared against the twilight clouds
that, all scarlet-gashed and purple,
swept across the autumn sky where
the cross flashed with varying
flame of sanguine and gold.
"Within those walls the huge
stone arches, richly carven with
Romanesque tracery, swung to
gether high into the gloom toward
the roof, undefined and mystical,
seemingly without strain. The
scaffolding hung prophetic over all
like a screen, still concealing the
beauties that were some day to be
all ours. For in the heart of even
the poorest student, as he watches
the Stanford chapel shaping into
grandeur, is the dearest sense of
possession. All the wealth and
beauty of it is ours, not to take
away, but to give forever to those
who shall come after, ever fairer
and worthier for being consecrated
by our gratitude and our hopes.
Therein have the founders of the
University been generous indeed,
for they have given of their riches
to make unselfish the lives of
others.
"Deep in the extremity of the
apse, above the relief carved in pure
Caprian marble of the " Descent to
the Tomb," gleamed the rich altar
piece, a rendering in Venetian mo
saic of Rosselli's " Last Supper,"
from the Sistine. Still higher,
sheathing the entire wall clear to
the oaken beams, appeared the
frieze of Prophets and the Moses of
Michael Angelo, figures of colossal
grandeur, brilliant in the pure
colors of the stones, inset upon a
ground of sheeted gold.
"Within the choir loft itself all
was dark save for the two candles
placed upon the console of the
organ, and from these the lights

ran up and down upon the rows of
| stately metal pipes on the mighty
instrument, like the flickering of
tapers ranged upon the high altar."
One of the finest literary touches
I in the story is the description of
the Senior, in his room on the last
evening in col lege:
"Stoddard looked into the mirror
and saw there a figure tall, hand
somely clothed; a face with clear,
fair skin and strongly cut features
— his own. Hut even in an instant
the eyes glinted cold and hard, the
chin set in lines of steel, and the
! fresh boy face was gone, and in its
I stead was the face of a strange man
whom he could not trust —his
own."
In the running over of Lupe, the
Mexican tamale hoy, by a Stanford
bus, a dramatic element is intro
duced that prepares the reader's
feelings for the climax of the story,
which is in this description of the
Senior's going away:
"The Owl train, the solid-vesti
buled flyer, one long trail of lights
glinting on plate glass and nick
eled furniture, whirled straight on
into the black night, south-bound,
across the plains of the lower val
ley. liud Stoddard stared from
the window of the car as every
ghostly streak of white beside the
track cut off another mile from
Stanford. He was going back to
Yucca, back to his work. The un
reasoned stoicism of the Mexican
boy, in his poverty, without hope,
had shown the college-bred man
what he himself needed.
"This was his Higher Educa
tion."
The feeling of the story, which
becomes intense at this climax, is
well sustained throughout, and the
story as a whole brings one a little
nearer to a realization of what the
new Stanford may mean to those of
us who are her children.
The photographs were recently
made by the /'osi's special photog
rapher. One is a large view of the
interior of the quad and, another is
an excellent picture of the new
chapel. Besides these, there are
several characteristic pictures of
students in rooms and on the cam
pus.
