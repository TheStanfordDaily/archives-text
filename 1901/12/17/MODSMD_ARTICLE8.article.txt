November's report of the treas
urer of the Associated Students
shows that the student body will
have $800 less than last year to
carry on the undergraduate activi
ties of next semester. Most of these
enterprises —debating, track, and
tennis—are not self-supporting, and
depend upon outside revenue for
successful operation. It is impor
tant, therefore, that every means of
income should l>e used. The stu
dent body assessments are a source
of financial aid that cannot well be
neglected. The fact that only $450
of these assessments, as against
$031 last year, have been brought
in, would indicate that about 700
students have neglected to pay
their student body dues. These
assessments can always be paid at
the Registrar's oflice at any time
during the semester, and every stu
dent should find it a pleasure to
aid the organization of which he is
a member by promptly paying this
$ 1.00 assessment.
