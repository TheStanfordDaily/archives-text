The Michigan Daily News has
gotten out a "woman's edition"
which is so distinctly clever in sub
ject-matter and art work, and so
attractive typographically, that the
Daily I'alo Alto's vocabulary
fails to respond to the call for ade
quate terms of appreciation. Wc
congratulate the Michigan co-eds
on their achievement, and would
say to our own sisters that when
ever they feci disposed to take a
try at journalism the Daily I'alo
Alto and its plant are at their dis
posal.
