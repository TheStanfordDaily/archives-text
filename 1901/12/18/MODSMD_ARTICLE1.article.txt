# FOOTBALL CAPTAIN.
## "Bill" Traeger, Star of Three Seasons, Will Lead Stanford's Eleven Next Year. 
### 
The highest honor that can come
to a St:i iiford football player was
this evening given by an unani
mous vote to William Ishaw Trae
ger, '03, left tackle, and one of the
most daring players of the game
ever seen on a Stanford gridiron.
His record is long and enviable, in
cluding good work in 1899 as guard
on the freshman team, and a spec
tacular game the same year as left
tackle on the Varsity. His tackles
were especially low, clean, and
hard, and lie was immediately rec
ognized as a man of excep
tional ability. Last year he
was at the same position,
and his place-kick from the thirty
five-yard line won the game for his
college. This year his work dur
ing the whole season was of a very
high grade. He was found at ev
ery point where a good man was
needed, and his smashing game in
the line, his quick hard tackles all
over the field, and his tearing runs
down the field on punts, were
among the best features of the in
tercollegiate contest.
Traeger's home is at Porterville.
He is taking Law as a major in the
University, and his honor comes to
him in his senior year.
