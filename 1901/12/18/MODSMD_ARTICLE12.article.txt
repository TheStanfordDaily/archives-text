# Y.M.C.A. CONFERENCE.
## Mr. Colton Talks of It and Discusses Students Prevailing Sin. 
### 
E. T. Colton, international sec
retary for theO ollege V. M. C. A.,
addressed the local association last
evening on the approaching Pacific
Coast Conference at Pacific Grove.
This is one of the four such confer
ences on the continent, one being at
Northfield, Maps., another at Asli
ville, N. C., and the third at Lake
Geneva, Wis. Last winter there
were twenty-three colleges repre
sented by one hundred men at
Pacific Grove. The purpose of
these meetings is to train and
deepen the spiritual lives of stu
dents. The mornings are given to
study of the Bible in classes directed
I)}' men of experience, and the
afternoons are devoted entirely to
recreation. Among the leaders
this year will be S. Earl Taylor of
the missionary department. Mr.
Hibbard, who graduated from the
University of Wisconsin two years
ago with reputation of strongest
chemist who ever left that institu
tion, will lead the Bible study.
Mr. Kennedy, a University of Cali
fornia man, will lead the studies in
the Life and Epistles of Paul.
Dr. Clampett, Trinity Episcopal
Church, San Francisco; Dr. Dille,
of the First M. E. Church, Oakland;
and Dr. Chapman of Los Angeles,
are among the platform speakers
on the program.
Following bis discussion of the
Conference, Mr. Colton spoke upon
the students' prevailing sin: The
most dangerous sins are not the
gross ones; they are so disgusting
that the temptation does not pre
sent itself. Some sins are held in
check by faculty regulation, and
by popular sentiment. In stu
dents' life the prevailing sin, the
one that is most universal, that is
condoned largely by faculty as well
as by students, is selfishness.
Students are not preparing to live
in college; they are living, and
habits will follow them through
life. Selfishness distorts the per
spective, leading to cheap choices.
It blunts the conception a man has
and tempts him to seek short cuts,
disregarding the opinion of others;
or it may make of one of a differ
ent temperament a cringing
coward, who is afraid of exciting
unfavorable comment. This evil
will also predestinate a man to a
life of discontentment and dissatis
faction. The man in college, who
lives on the theory that be should
get something for every exertion,
ought to join the association of the
upturned palm, as typified by the
hotel lackey looking for a tip.
Finally, this vice of students dulls
the sense of human, need and clouds
the sense of responsibility to fellow
men.
