J. R. Whittembre was Stanford's
captain in the initial game with
Berkeley, played on March 9, 1892.
Stanford won by a score of 14 to 10.
Whittemore played the fullback
position, and Clemans and Down
ing, the two halfbacks, afterwards
became Varsity captains. Whitte
more left the following year for
Cornell, where lie took the mechan
ical and mining engineers' degree
in '90. Since then he has been
manager and consulting engineer
for the Phoenix Dredging Com
pany of New York,and also for the
St. Louis Steam Power Company of
St. Louis. At present he is super
intendent of the Erie City Iron
Works at Erie, Penu. Whittemore
held the college records in the high
and low hurdles.
In the write-up of this 14 to 10
game the Daily Palo Alto made
special mention of the wonderful
work of Carl L. Clemans.
The second intercollegiate game
with California was held on De
cember 17th of this same year, with
Clemans as captain. Clemans was

a member of Sigma Nu fraternity.
Since graduation he has spent most
of his time in mining operations
and newspaper work. At present
he is an attorney in Snohomish,
Wash.
The next captain was James F.
Wilson, an Illinois man, who came
to the University at the beginning
of the year '93. In those days the
captain was notchosen until shortly
before the big game. Wilson's
work with the men and his won
derful football ability won for him
the election the same season, al
though he had never played against
Berkeley. He gained his football
experience at the Illinois State
Normal School. While in the Uni
versity he was president of his
class, an associate editor of. the
Sequoia, and editor-in-chief of the
Daily Palo Alto. After gradua
tion he secured a position as teacher
of history in the Boys' High School
'.112 New York City, which position
he still holds.
Paul M. Downing, who led the
team in 1894, could play almost
any position with success. In the
spring of '92 lie was a halfback.
The next year he went to the line,
where he played at center and
tackle during the remainder of his
college career. Downing was a
Sigma Nu, and made the baseball
team in his freshman year. He is
now superintendent of the electrical
department of the Blue Lakes
Water Company at Blue Lakes,
California.
Guy H. Cochran, '90, was a Los
Angeles man. He played for three
consecutive years against Berkeley
as left tackle; the fourth year, that
of his captaincy, he went behind
the line to the fullback's position.
He also made the intercollegiate
tennis team in his third year. For
the last three years of his college
career he was a member of the C J lee
Club. Instead of pursuing his
studies in English, which he had
commenced in his undergraduate
work, Cochran took up the study of
medicine at Columbia, where he
was a sub on the Columbia boat
crew. His headquarters have been
in New York, where he was for a
number of years a substitute at the
Presbyterian Hospital of New York
City.
With Cochran passed out those
old-timers who to later-day Stan
fordites are more like reminiscences
than realities. Within the last
four seasons the other captains,
Fickert, Cotton, Forrest Fisher,
Murphy, "Babe" Burnett, and
Ralph Fisher, have been seen either
playing or coaching on the football
field.
Nearly every write-up of Charlie
Fickert mentions the fact that he
came out of the wilds of Tehachapi,
never having seen a football before
entering Stanford. His work with
this season's team has made him
as familiar a figure to tlie under
graduate of today as he was to the
undergraduate of five or six years
ago. Fickert held many offices
while at college, among them being
that of class president, student
body vice-president, and student
body treasurer. But.it is as a foot
ball man that he is best known.
For four years he played at guard,
the third being when he wascaptain

Fickert has been admitted to
the California bar aiid is practic
ing law in San Francisco.
After Fickert came Steuart W.
Cotton, the youngest man who ever
made the Stanford Varsity; he was
but sixteen years old when he
played right end on Downing's
team. The next year he was at
tackle, and the two following years
as fullback. He was president of
his class in his sophomore year.
Cotton is at present engaged in
business in the Philippine Islands,
having but recently left Alaska en
terprises for that place.
Forrest S. Fisher arose in his
sophomore year from the ranks of
the second eleven to the halfback's
position, which place he played in
the Thanksgiving games of that
and the following year. In his senior
year he was fullback on the team,
when his defensive work was especi
ally noteworthy. He was unable
to play the whole game on account
of injuries. After leaving college
Fisher was appointed postmaster at
The Dalles, Oregon, which place he
held until lie received a govern
ment positionin Washington, I). C.,
and at present he is attending
Columbian University at that city,
taking work in the International
Law and Diplomacy department.
"diet" Murphy's career in col
lege is so recent that it does not
need much comment. His work at
quarter-back has made him a rep
utation as a football player in the
East, where the present season he
has been playing with the Harvard
Law School Murphy was cap
tain of his freshman team. In
other athletics he was prominent;
he won a sweater on the track in
the bicycle races, and for four con
secutive years played on the base
ball team, the fourth one being
last year, when he was taking post
graduate work at the University.
He was a member of Zeta Psi.
"Babe" Burnett captained the 5
to 0 team last fall. He played on
the teams of the University of Pa
cific and the University of Southern
California before entering Stanford.
In bis freshman year, 1896, he
played sub-center. His greatest
game was as varsity center in '97,
when he was in the height of his
football career. He went to the
Philippines with the Utah battery,
but returned in time to play tackle
on the defeated team of '98. Bur
nett left the University last Christ
mas, and was engaged in business
in the Yosemite up to the beginning
of this semester. At present he is
doing work in the University.
In looking through the above it
will be seen that the following is
true: The three captains, Whitte
more, Wilson, and Downing have
been interested in work directly in
keeping with their college studies,
Whittemore, and Downing both
being superintendents of engineer
ing works, and Wilson a teacher of
history. Cochran broke away from
his college work, English, and
turned bis attention to medicine
with considerable success. Clem
ans, a Physics major, is now an
attorney. Fickert and Cotton were
History majors; Fickert has taken
up the profession of law, and Cot
ton has gone into the mercantile
trade. Forrest Fisher, Murphy,

and Burnett were all Law men
and at present each is following
up his studies, Fisher at Columbia,
Murphy at Harvard, and Burnett
at Stanford.

names of the men who have cap

the second eleven to the halfback's
position, which place he played in
the Thanksgiving games of that
and the following year. In his senior
year he was fullback on the team,
when his defensive work was especi
ally noteworthy. He was unable
to play the whole game on account
of injuries. After leaving college
Fisher was appointed postmaster at
The Dalles, Oregon, which place he
held until lie received a govern
ment positionin Washington, I). C.,
and at present he is attending
Columbian University at that city,
taking work in the International
Law and Diplomacy department.
"diet" Murphy's career in col
lege is so recent that it does not
need much comment. His work at
quarter-back has made him a rep
utation as a football player in the
East, where the present season he
has been playing with the Harvard
Law School Murphy was cap
tain of his freshman team. In
other athletics he was prominent;
he won a sweater on the track in
the bicycle races, and for four con
secutive years played on the base
ball team, the fourth one being
last year, when he was taking post
graduate work at the University.
He was a member of Zeta Psi.
"Babe" Burnett captained the 5
to 0 team last fall. He played on
the teams of the University of Pa
cific and the University of Southern
California before entering Stanford.
In bis freshman year, 1896, he
played sub-center. His greatest
game was as varsity center in '97,
when he was in the height of his
football career. He went to the
Philippines with the Utah battery,
but returned in time to play tackle
on the defeated team of '98. Bur
nett left the University last Christ
mas, and was engaged in business
in the Yosemite up to the beginning
of this semester. At present he is
doing work in the University.
In looking through the above it
will be seen that the following is
true: The three captains, Whitte
more, Wilson, and Downing have
been interested in work directly in
keeping with their college studies,
Whittemore, and Downing both
being superintendents of engineer
ing works, and Wilson a teacher of
history. Cochran broke away from
his college work, English, and
turned bis attention to medicine
with considerable success. Clem
ans, a Physics major, is now an
attorney. Fickert and Cotton were
History majors; Fickert has taken
up the profession of law, and Cot
ton has gone into the mercantile
trade. Forrest Fisher, Murphy,

and Burnett were all Law men
and at present each is following
up his studies, Fisher at Columbia,
Murphy at Harvard, and Burnett
at Stanford.
Herewith is a table showing the
names of the men who have cap
tained the Stanford football teams
from the first, season up to the pres
ent, giving their major study, their
place in the team, and the year in
which they held their positions.

J. R. Whittembre was Stanford's
captain in the initial game with
Berkeley, played on March 9, 1892.
Stanford won by a score of 14 to 10.
Whittemore played the fullback
position, and Clemans and Down
ing, the two halfbacks, afterwards
became Varsity captains. Whitte
more left the following year for
Cornell, where lie took the mechan
ical and mining engineers' degree
in '90. Since then he has been
manager and consulting engineer
for the Phoenix Dredging Com
pany of New York,and also for the
St. Louis Steam Power Company of
St. Louis. At present he is super
intendent of the Erie City Iron
Works at Erie, Penu. Whittemore
held the college records in the high
and low hurdles.
In the write-up of this 14 to 10
game the Daily Palo Alto made
special mention of the wonderful
work of Carl L. Clemans.
The second intercollegiate game
with California was held on De
cember 17th of this same year, with
Clemans as captain. Clemans was

a member of Sigma Nu fraternity.
Since graduation he has spent most
of his time in mining operations
and newspaper work. At present
he is an attorney in Snohomish,
Wash.
The next captain was James F.
Wilson, an Illinois man, who came
to the University at the beginning
of the year '93. In those days the
captain was notchosen until shortly
before the big game. Wilson's
work with the men and his won
derful football ability won for him
the election the same season, al
though he had never played against
Berkeley. He gained his football
experience at the Illinois State
Normal School. While in the Uni
versity he was president of his
class, an associate editor of. the
Sequoia, and editor-in-chief of the
Daily Palo Alto. After gradua
tion he secured a position as teacher
of history in the Boys' High School
'.112 New York City, which position
he still holds.
Paul M. Downing, who led the
team in 1894, could play almost
any position with success. In the
spring of '92 lie was a halfback.
The next year he went to the line,
where he played at center and
tackle during the remainder of his
college career. Downing was a
Sigma Nu, and made the baseball
team in his freshman year. He is
now superintendent of the electrical
department of the Blue Lakes
Water Company at Blue Lakes,
California.
Guy H. Cochran, '90, was a Los
Angeles man. He played for three
consecutive years against Berkeley
as left tackle; the fourth year, that
of his captaincy, he went behind
the line to the fullback's position.
He also made the intercollegiate
tennis team in his third year. For
the last three years of his college
career he was a member of the C J lee
Club. Instead of pursuing his
studies in English, which he had
commenced in his undergraduate
work, Cochran took up the study of
medicine at Columbia, where he
was a sub on the Columbia boat
crew. His headquarters have been
in New York, where he was for a
number of years a substitute at the
Presbyterian Hospital of New York
City.
With Cochran passed out those
old-timers who to later-day Stan
fordites are more like reminiscences
than realities. Within the last
four seasons the other captains,
Fickert, Cotton, Forrest Fisher,
Murphy, "Babe" Burnett, and
Ralph Fisher, have been seen either
playing or coaching on the football
field.
Nearly every write-up of Charlie
Fickert mentions the fact that he
came out of the wilds of Tehachapi,
never having seen a football before
entering Stanford. His work with
this season's team has made him
as familiar a figure to tlie under
graduate of today as he was to the
undergraduate of five or six years
ago. Fickert held many offices
while at college, among them being
that of class president, student
body vice-president, and student
body treasurer. But.it is as a foot
ball man that he is best known.
For four years he played at guard,
the third being when he wascaptain

Fickert has been admitted to
the California bar aiid is practic
ing law in San Francisco.
After Fickert came Steuart W.
Cotton, the youngest man who ever
made the Stanford Varsity; he was
but sixteen years old when he
played right end on Downing's
team. The next year he was at
tackle, and the two following years
as fullback. He was president of
his class in his sophomore year.
Cotton is at present engaged in
business in the Philippine Islands,
having but recently left Alaska en
terprises for that place.
Forrest S. Fisher arose in his
sophomore year from the ranks of
the second eleven to the halfback's
position, which place he played in
the Thanksgiving games of that
and the following year. In his senior
year he was fullback on the team,
when his defensive work was especi

spring of '92 lie was a halfback.
The next year he went to the line,
where he played at center and
tackle during the remainder of his
college career. Downing was a
Sigma Nu, and made the baseball
team in his freshman year. He is
now superintendent of the electrical
department of the Blue Lakes
Water Company at Blue Lakes,
California.
Guy H. Cochran, '90, was a Los
Angeles man. He played for three
consecutive years against Berkeley
as left tackle; the fourth year, that
of his captaincy, he went behind
the line to the fullback's position.
He also made the intercollegiate
tennis team in his third year. For
the last three years of his college
career he was a member of the C J lee
Club. Instead of pursuing his
studies in English, which he had
commenced in his undergraduate
work, Cochran took up the study of
medicine at Columbia, where he
was a sub on the Columbia boat
crew. His headquarters have been
in New York, where he was for a
number of years a substitute at the
Presbyterian Hospital of New York
City.
With Cochran passed out those
old-timers who to later-day Stan
fordites are more like reminiscences
than realities. Within the last
four seasons the other captains,
Fickert, Cotton, Forrest Fisher,
Murphy, "Babe" Burnett, and
Ralph Fisher, have been seen either
playing or coaching on the football
field.
Nearly every write-up of Charlie
Fickert mentions the fact that he
came out of the wilds of Tehachapi,
never having seen a football before
entering Stanford. His work with
this season's team has made him
as familiar a figure to tlie under
graduate of today as he was to the
undergraduate of five or six years
ago. Fickert held many offices
while at college, among them being
that of class president, student
body vice-president, and student
body treasurer. But.it is as a foot
ball man that he is best known.
For four years he played at guard,
the third being when he wascaptain

Fickert has been admitted to
the California bar aiid is practic
ing law in San Francisco.
After Fickert came Steuart W.
Cotton, the youngest man who ever
made the Stanford Varsity; he was
but sixteen years old when he
played right end on Downing's
team. The next year he was at
tackle, and the two following years
as fullback. He was president of
his class in his sophomore year.
Cotton is at present engaged in
business in the Philippine Islands,
having but recently left Alaska en
terprises for that place.
Forrest S. Fisher arose in his
sophomore year from the ranks of
the second eleven to the halfback's
position, which place he played in
the Thanksgiving games of that
and the following year. In his senior
year he was fullback on the team,
when his defensive work was especi
ally noteworthy. He was unable
to play the whole game on account
of injuries. After leaving college
Fisher was appointed postmaster at
The Dalles, Oregon, which place he
held until lie received a govern
ment positionin Washington, I). C.,
and at present he is attending
Columbian University at that city,
taking work in the International
Law and Diplomacy department.
"diet" Murphy's career in col
lege is so recent that it does not
need much comment. His work at
quarter-back has made him a rep
utation as a football player in the
East, where the present season he
has been playing with the Harvard
Law School Murphy was cap
tain of his freshman team. In
other athletics he was prominent;
he won a sweater on the track in
the bicycle races, and for four con
secutive years played on the base
ball team, the fourth one being
last year, when he was taking post
graduate work at the University.
He was a member of Zeta Psi.
"Babe" Burnett captained the 5
to 0 team last fall. He played on
the teams of the University of Pa
cific and the University of Southern
California before entering Stanford.
In bis freshman year, 1896, he
played sub-center. His greatest
game was as varsity center in '97,
when he was in the height of his
football career. He went to the
Philippines with the Utah battery,
but returned in time to play tackle
on the defeated team of '98. Bur
nett left the University last Christ
mas, and was engaged in business
in the Yosemite up to the beginning
of this semester. At present he is
doing work in the University.
In looking through the above it
will be seen that the following is
true: The three captains, Whitte
more, Wilson, and Downing have
been interested in work directly in
keeping with their college studies,
Whittemore, and Downing both
being superintendents of engineer
ing works, and Wilson a teacher of
history. Cochran broke away from
his college work, English, and
turned bis attention to medicine
with considerable success. Clem
ans, a Physics major, is now an
attorney. Fickert and Cotton were
History majors; Fickert has taken
up the profession of law, and Cot
ton has gone into the mercantile
trade. Forrest Fisher, Murphy,

and Burnett were all Law men
and at present each is following
up his studies, Fisher at Columbia,
Murphy at Harvard, and Burnett
at Stanford.
