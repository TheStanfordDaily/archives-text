# New Exhibit at Museum.

### 
There has recently arrived at the
Museum and been putin place an
exhibit which is of particular im
portance in California history. It
is a small whalebone model of the
old Carmel mission built near
Monterey in 1770, and as this is
one of the oldest Spanish missions
in the state, it will be of much in
terest to those who are interested
in the early mission days of Cali
fornia. The model was built es
pecially for the Museum by par
ties in Monterey. It is on a wooden
base, and is thirty-two indies wide,
thirty-six inches long, and about
twenty-four inches high. This
model will be a fitting nucleus to a
distinctive collection representing
the early history of the state, which
will be started before long
