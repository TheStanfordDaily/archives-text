The accompanying extracts from
ft personal letter written by Ad
vance, agent Morrison ought to be
read by every member of the musi
cal clubs before starting on their
Christmas tour. Not that there is
any danger of Stanford men re
flecting discredit on the institution,
for theri pride in its reputation is
too intense. Hut the knowledge of
the errors that their predecessors
have fallen into may, perhaps, help
the Cardinal musicians to shine the
more brightly in contrast. Mr.
Morrison expresses himself thus:
"The prospects are encouraging,
though I am badly handicapped
for lack of time.
"One thing I want to emphasize
right here, and 1 want you to im
press it, on the Clubs. That is, that
they must conduct themselves in a
gentlemanly manner, and not
"queer" Stanford's reputation
through the South the way Berke
ley has done for herself. 1 have
met several theatrical managers
who say they would not play Berke
ley boys on any terms. The boys
ought to have a jolly time, cer
tainly, but there is a limit. 11. C.'s
reputation is bad everywhere, both
as entertainers and as gentlemen.
At one place they smeared mo
lasses over the door-knobs of a
whole hotel, and broke into the
pantry and destroyed all the pas
try. This is only one of their
minor offences."
