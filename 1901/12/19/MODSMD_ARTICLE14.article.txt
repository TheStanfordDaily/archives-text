Available graduate football
coaches seem to be limited among
the Stanford alumni, and the article
published today suggests a serious
problem for next season. Our
alumni are located in all parts of
the world, many of them being so
far away or having such business
engagements that it is impossible
to secure them for a few weeks in
the fall. This raises the question
of the wisdom of the graduate
sytsem at the present time, which
threatens, as Walter Camp pointed
out in an article some weeks ago,
the decline of football on the Coast
because of isolation from Eastern
methods and players. The remedy
for this danger is to arrange con
tests with more institutions than
we now have, thus enabling the
men playing on our teams to meet
and to learn a variety of methods.
Each year the number of graduates
increases, and the men playing to
day will he called upon to coach in
the future. Every time they pi ay
a well trained team, they gain that
much more experience in the game,
and accordingly become better fit
ted to develop a Stanford style of
play, just as Princeton, Yale, and
Pennsylvania have become dis
tinguished.
