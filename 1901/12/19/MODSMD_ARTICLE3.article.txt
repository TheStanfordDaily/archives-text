Today Treasurer Edwards of the
Associated Students turned over
$1,118.11 to Dr. Angel I for the
Training-House fund. This repre
sents five per cent, of the gross gate
receipts from games during the
year, added to the student body
assessments, all of which go to this
purpose. The fund now amounts
to more than $3,000.
