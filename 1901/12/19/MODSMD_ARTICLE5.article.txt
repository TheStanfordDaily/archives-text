### 
Miss Irene Hardy, formerly as
sistant professor in the English de
partment, has published a hook of
poems. Professor M. B. Anderson
writes the following for the Daily
Palo Alto:
"The many friends of Miss Irene
Hardy will be pleased to learn that
they may now possess a permanent
memorial of her in the shape of a
collection of her charming poems.
The edition is limited to three hun
dred copies, most of which are
already subscribed for. At my
solicitation, Miss Hardy lias di
rected her publisher to send to the
Stanford Bookstore a small number
of copies, which may be had at the
price of one dollar and fifty cents.
The book is outwardly very taste
ful, highly creditable to the printer,
Mr. Murdock, and to its publishers,
Elder and Shephard. The beauty
and the insight of some of these
poems will surprise even Miss
Hardy's intimate friends. The
book is essentially California!),
many of the poems were composed
at Palo Alto â€”and the peculiar
beauties of the California land
scape, both lowland and highland,
seem to pervade the verses. We
all know Miss Hardy as a wise, pa
tient, large-sou led teacher, a whole
some adviser, a gracious compan
ion, and a tender friend. She is
now revealed to us as a true poet.
Her book will be treasured not only
by her personal friends, but by all
who are interested in California
literal u re."
