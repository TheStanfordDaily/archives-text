# POSSIBLE COACHES
## Scarcity of Available Material is Somewhat Startling- to Supporters of the Cardinal. 
### 
Since the old system of import
ing Eastern football coaches* was
terminated by agreement with Cal
ifornia, the problem here has been
which of the Alumni are best fitted
for the position, and which can be
secured. This season the Cardinal
was more than fortunate in being
under the guidance of* Charlie
Fickert, one of the sturdiest foot
ball men that ever wore Stanford
moleskins, and a trio of assistants
who knew thoroughly the ins and
outs of the game. The solution of
the question, so easy and satisfact
ory this year, may, when it arises
again, present difficulties, from the
fact that the material is limited.
There has been more than a little
discussion of this by those who are
interested in the welfare of the
Cardinal, and the resulting investi
gation has shown pretty clearly
what men are possible.
It is generally conceded by those
conversant with prevailing condi
tions that the selection of a coach
should be based on these several
points: on agreeable personality, a
capacity for leadership, an enthus
iasm for the work, a fine practical
and technical knowledge of the
game, and, perhaps, a record for
popularity among the fellows of
their time. An inspection of the
list of men who have won Varsity
football sweaters in former years
shows that there are many who
would fill these requirements. Hut
there are few so situated as to
make them available. And it is
this problem which Stanford will
have to face when the student body
considers the coach possibilities of
the future.
The limited number of gradu
ates who are so placed that they
can be secured is startling. Here
they are, as reported by members
of the faculty who are interested
enough in football to keep track of
the former players: Franken
heimer, left half, '92, '93, '94, '95;
Clematis, halfback,' 92; Pan! Down
ing, halfback, '92, center, '93; 11 ar
relson, quarter-back, '93, '94;
Whitehouse, tackle, '93; Cotton,
fullback, '96, '97; Williams, center,
'95, '96; Murphy, quarter, '96, '97,
'98, '99. These are all desirable
men, but they are few, and it is not
certain that any-one of them can be
secured. Fickert, Spaulding, Mc-
Millan, and Lewers will all be
available for next year, which
brightens the prospect somewhat.
