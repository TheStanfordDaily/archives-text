# From the New Captain.

### 
Much criticism has been passed
on the lack of interest in training
shown by the hoys last season. It
may he that many reasons can he
given for the lack of training, hut
these reasons can never stand as
valid excuses. There are occa
sions. oftentimes, that give reasons
for many things. Yet, these may
not he justifiable.
I only hope that next season
there will he no occasion to give
excuses for lack of training. I am
sure that circumstances will he
such that every man will he ready
and willing to observe the rules,

which will lie strictly enforced.
There can he no unity where each
man units himself; there can lie no
victory where there is no unity;
and, since, victory is the outgrowth
of unity, unity we must have.
Jt is said that through his faults
man makes progress. We want
men who can profit hy their faults.
It cannot he said with justice that
Stanford has among her athletes
one who is incapable of overcoming
a fault. We can surely give our
hoys the benefit, of a doubt and
trust them to profit by the fault
which caused the last defeat.
It will do no good to grumble
and growl about last season. It is
kindly criticism that works good
effect. Let eacli one of the Cardi
nal forget last season with all its
unpleasantnesses, and look forward
to the next. Let each one stand
by his col lege, determined that no
act or word of his shall be a bar to
that unity which is necessary to
victory. W. 1. Tkaeger.
