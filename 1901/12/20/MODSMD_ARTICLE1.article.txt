# NEW BUILDING.
## Ground for Mechanical Engineering Laboratory Will be Broken in Ten Days. 
### 
Ground is to broken within ten
days for the new Mechanical Engi
neering, building which is to be lo
cated next to the power-house an i
is to form the first of the new struc
tures that are to complete the outer
quadrangle. In a sense this is to
be one of the most attractive of the
University buildings, and in size
is the largest of the pres
ent buildings with the ex
ception of the Museum. The
main building is to have a front
age of two hundred and twenty-five
feet, and is to be sixty feet wide.
This-will lie used for a laboratory
for the Mechanical and Electrical
Engineering departments. It will
extend to Lasuen street on the east,
and will face the road back of the
chapel. Jt, is to have a very at
tractive main entrance. The gen
eral design is similar to the other
buildings, with the exception of the
portico. The interior is to have
concrete floors.
In addition, there is to be a rear
wing fifty by seventy-two feet, and
will be built two stories high, the
main laboratory building being a
single-story building. The wing is
to l>e of stone, and is to be the head
quarters of the superintendent, ofli
cers, and engineers.
Contractors are now figuring on
the plans, and it is the intention of
Architect Hodges to have this work
rushed to a speedy completion, and
if possible to have it entirely com
pleted by the first of June next.
Workmen are busy now taking out
obstructing trees, and during next
week the old railroad track will be
torn up to allow for the beginning
of excavations.
Architect Hodges is now at work
on the plans of another Engineer
ing building to be located at right
angles to the Mechanical building,
and directly across the new road.
This one will contain the wood
shops and drafting-rooms of the
Mechanical and Electrical Engi
neering departments, and is to be
connected by an arcade to the re
maining buildings of the outer
quadrangle. Work on this new
building will begin very soon after
the first of next year. The general
architectural scheme of the present
buildings is to be followed in the
construction.
