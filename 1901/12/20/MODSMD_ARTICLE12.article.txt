Thk question of u change in the
method of management of student
hody athletics, which has heen dis
missed at various times in tlie
columns of this paper, deserves a
parting shot at the end of the pres
ent regime. Several communi
cations on this subject have been
received from alumni, but only a
few have heen published. Old stu
dents are liable to consider the
columns of the Daily I'alo Ai/ro
a medium for settling old questions
of dispute with the faculty or
other alumni. It is difficult for
the editor of the later days always
to distinguish between these retali
atory measures and general common
sense arguments. The reasoning
deduced by an alumnus, as printed
November 20th, against an athletic
association on the basis that a for
mer association proved a failure, is
cogent to those who are unac
quainted with the former organi
zation. This associa tion, however,
was poorly managed, and loosely
arranged. No argument, either
for or against, can be drawn from
this trial of management.
A change in our present organi
zation will come sooner or later.
Every indication points to a differ
ent management of our athletics.
'I'llis may come in four ways: First,
in the plans of operation of the
new gymnasium; second, by the
faculty appointment of a general
athletic director; third, in the de
velopment of the training-house
scheme; and fourth, by direct stu
dent body legislation and the for
mation of an athletic association.

This last possibility should appeal
to the associated students as the
most feasible, practical, and desir
able. The faculty has probably
been sincere in its efforts to control
undergraduate affairs, and their
advice is not to be slighted. Un
dergraduates usually prefer inde
pendence in their activities. Hut
the faculty will no doubt make
their advice compulsory unless
steps are taken by the students
themselves to remedy present difli
culties.
