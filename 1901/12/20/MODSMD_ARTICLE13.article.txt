It has been customary through
out the Daily Palo Alto's exist
ence for the retiring editor to ex
press, in a masterly editorial, his
gratitude and appreciation for the
unselfish efforts of his fellow-work
ers. All that has been said in the
way of commendation by the
eighteen previous editors could be
expressed with unusual emphasis
by the present one. There has
never been a harder-working, more
conscientious and efficient staff.
