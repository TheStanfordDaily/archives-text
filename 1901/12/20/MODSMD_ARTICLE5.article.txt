# The
						Funny Paper.

### 
The Chaparral made its last issue
for this semester yesterday, and
copies were distributed today. The
crafty editors have evidently had a
few jokes held out for their final
effort, and "Chappie" really has
come up to a remarkably high
standard. The frontispiece is a
baseball man doing a plastic pose
on the disused oval, and there is
also a well-executed, detachable
ghost scene, with some excellent
poetry about it. Some of the jokes
are original and funny. "Orrin"
and the pink cards receive their
usual honorable mention; and the
Musical Clubs' members are told to
be good "'ittle" boys while they
are away.
