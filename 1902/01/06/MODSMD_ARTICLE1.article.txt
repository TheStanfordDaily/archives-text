# MICHIGAN RAN UP A BIG SCORE.
## But the Stanford Men Made a Magnificent Fight at Pasadena New Year's Day.—Marvelous Grit Shown by Injured Players. 
### 
Forty-nine to nothing is a con
vincing score, but it does not tell
the story of the big football game
played at Pasadena on New Year's
day. The many redeeming feat
ures of the losing game played by
the plucky Stanford representa
tives is not there chronicled.
Stanford was unable to withstand
the famous team work which had
been instilled into the Michigan
eleven by its winning coach, Yost.
She was unable to endure the at
tack of the better conditioned men.
Physical endurance, perfected for
the Michigan team by Trainer
Fitzpatrick, told against the' Card
inal representatives. But Stanford
in the first twenty minutes of play
showed that she possessed a knowl
edge of football. Michigan was re
pelled twice in Stanford territory,
and then the Cardinal crossed the
field and twice tried place kicks at
the goal of the Eastern men, both
from within the forty-fi ve-vard line.
The Stanford men went into the
game with a vim and snap that al
most nonplussed their opponents,
who were surprised at the way
these Westerners played. After
about ten minutes of play the
Michigan players were still more
surprised. The gravity of the situ
ation was soon appreciated by their
little quarter, who began to incite
his men with cries of '' Dig in
there, we haven't a snap." " Hur
ry-up" Yost frantically paced the
side-lines, overcome with nervous
desperation, so unexpected was this
indication of a Stanford score. He
j - -i - •
ate as line-man. When he grabbed
the rod from Phil Wilson's hand,
however, with the explanation,
" Put this here," he received a cuff
in the back of the neck from
Phil's strong right arm that put a
check to his enthusiasm.
Speaking of the defense of its
goal by the Stanford team, the San
Francisco Chronicle said:
" Late in the first half of the
game Stanford presented the most
magnificent defense ever seen on a
Far Western football field. Michi
gan had battered across all Stan
ford's territory and it looked like a
certain touchdown, with but three
yards to go. Stanford stopped
Michigan a hand's breadth from
the last white line, but it was first
down and three more chances to
carry the hall those four inches.
Again Michigan renewed her efforts,
and when the tangle of players
separated there lay the ball still
four inches from the line. Once
more Michigan formed for a terri
ble onslaught. Like a stone wall
stood the Stanford team, and down
went twenty-two men in a heap,
with big Bill Traeger on a Michi
gan man, whom he had lunged
through and tackled for a yard's
loss.
<l For the third and last time
Michigan stormed to make that little
distance. Again Stanford made a

tremendous effort. The writhing
heap was on the very line. The
eight thousand spectators were on
their feet in keen expectation.
There lay the ball, still six inches
from the line, and then a roar, a
thunder of applause went up for
the Stanford boys who had made
that fight within inches of their
goal and won. Three minutes later
Michigan was battering away with
in the five-yard line for another
try, and again Stanford stopped
the attack and took the ball away
only inches from goal."
The seventy-minute match was
twenly-tive minutes old before
Michigan could score a point, and
Stanford had already had two tries
for goals from the field. But Stan
ford was not able to keep up this
standard of play. She had a team
with a third of them substitutes.
Tarpey at quarter was a new man
who had played the position only
two days before. At that time
Bansbach, Stanford's heady quar
ter-back, received double injuries,
and Tarpey, who had been playing
end and halfback, was the only
available candidate for the vacan
cy. It is not possible to judge
what the score might have been
with Bansbach at his place. He
held the eleven together as a unit,
making that team work so essen
tial to a successful game of football.
To expect Paul Tarpey, after play
ing the quarter position Iwo days,
to fill Bansbach's place was out of
the question. He played a good
game under the conditions.
p...j ... i j
accuracy in handling punts, Stan
ford suffered the enormous adverse
score. At least seventeen points
were due to fumbling of Michigan
kicks, and six of the Cardinal
players retired from injuries, while
the Michigan team left the fight
apparently as good, physically, as
they entered it. About the third
down Roosevelt, at guard, received
a kick on the shin that shattered
the large bone. He told Captain
Fisher that something was broken,
but the Captain said "Stay with
it,"and he answered ''All right."
He stayed for ten minutes more
while the Michigan line continually
forced him for short gains. His
left leg was useless, but he could
hop to his position. And when
Stanford made her heroic stand on
her own goal line Michigan bucked
Roosevelt twice with no gain, so
perfect was the defense of the Car
dinal man. But when, in a dusky
scrimmage, Roosevelt received a kick
in the side knocking his wind and
fracturing a rib, he hopped on his
uninjured leg to the side-lines for a
man to take his place.
Clark at end played a fast and
lierce game until his old injuries
to his knee became aggravated, and
his knees swayed under him. He
wobbled about, and at last reluct
antly limped to the side. He was
replaced by Preston.

Early in the first half Clark
came near scoring for his Univer
sity. He took the ball on a quarter
hack kick from the Michigan end,
and almost got clear'for a touch
down. His weak knees, however,
prevented him, and he was stopped
with a gain of seventeen yards.
McGil vray, who has had only two
weeks practice this season, played
an exceptional game at full until
he, likewise, was forced to retire
from injuries. Slaker succeeded
him at full, and Allen took his
place at half. Then Traeger, who
had undoubtedly outplayed Mich
igan's crack tackle of the Middle
West, Shorts, in every point of the
game, left the field with a useless
arm. He had wrenched the liga
ments of his right shoulder in
making a beautiful, hut fierce,
tackle early in the play, and had
continued in the game until he
could endure it no longer. Kennedy
was placed at left tackle,and finally
Cooper had to limp off the field,
and give way to Sefton, who had
not practiced with the men at Pasa
dena. Towards the end Van Sickle,
who had taken Roosevelt's position,
was taken out, Lee moved to guard,
and Hauverman placed at center.
With so many substitutes in the
Held, some of them in strange posi
tions, it is no surprise that Mich
igan scored 32 points during the
second half.
Stanford was defeated, but Mich
igan had found in the Far West the
most powerful defensive football
team she had ever opposed.

Details of the Game.
The most vivid detailed account
of the big contest is given in the
following paragraphs from the
Chronicle.
"The first half took an hour and
eight minutes, instead of the regu
lation thirty-five minutes. Mich
igan had the opening kick-off.
Sweeley boosted the ball forty
yards, and little Tarpey ran it
back fourteen and fumbled when
tackled, but recovered. Stanford
lined up for the initial scrimmage,
Michigan tore through and spoiled
the pass and got the fumbled ball.
Then Michigan crouched. Twice
the tackles' attack was hurled at
McFadden and gained yards.
Then it was changed over to
Traeger for a yard, then for the loss
of a yard. Then Roosevelt was
hammered for three yards, but
Michigan had failed to make the
required distance. Stanford failed
to make distance on two downs
and Fisher punted up to the forty
five-yard line. One of his men in
terfered with Michigan's attempted
free catch and Michigan was given
15 yards.
"From the thirty-yard line to the
twelve Michigan battered quickly,
hammering at McFadden, Roose
velt and Lee. Then Stanford
broke through and downed Snow
three yards behind the line. Mich
down again and four yards to gain,
so Michigan quickly executed a
quarter-back kick far out toward
Clark's end, but Clark was after
the ball like a shot, and took it
away from the on-rushing Michi
gan end and tore up the field seven
teen yards and almost got clear
for a long run to a touchdown.
"Then on the thirty-yard line
Stanford went at Michigan with all
Michigan's own fury. Slaker and
McGilvray, the new player, went at
Michigan's line like human batter
ing rams, and made the two first
downs. Michigan was penalized
ten yards for playing off side. Twice
in succession Stanford gained
through Shorts, reputed to be the
greatest tackle in all the Middle
West. Traeger was against Shorts,
and was giving him the tussle of
his life. Fisher punted down to
Michigan's twelve-yard line, and
Weeks could recover but three
yards before Cooper dropped him.
Sweeley immediately punted up to
the center of the field, and Michi
gan's ends were upon Fisher before
lie could start. Slaker and McGil
vray began hammering the Michi
gan line, and lunging outside on
tackles for short gains. McGilvray
shot straight through Michigan's
mighty center for eight yards.
Stanford had reached Michigan's
thirty-five-yard line. It was third
down and three yards to gain.
"Tarpey and Traeger dropped back
ten yards and prepared for a place
kick at Michigan's goal. Like a
wall the Stanford team held on de
fense, the ball soared upward, but
slightly to the left. It was caught
three yards from the line. Sweeley
punted in first down nearly to the
forty-yard line. Again Stanford
had the ball, and McGilvray was
sent at Michigan's men. 'Isn't that
man McGilvray a good one?' yelled
Yost, on the side-line, in his ap
proval of a good opponent.
"Once more Tarpey and Traeger
dropped back near the forty-five
yard line and smoothed the dusty
field for a try at Michigan's goal,
but this time Michigan burst
through, and the ball struck the
hunch and rebounded, a dozen
men chasing it for thirty yards.
Michigan grabbed it, but dropped
it again to Preston, 175 pounds,
who had taken Clark's place at
end. Fisher punted back to Mich
igan's forty-yard line, and there
Michigan began a furious series of
plays. Ten scrimmages netted
sixty-seven yards, and Michigan
had thrust the ball over Stanford's
last line for a touchdown. A fake
kick had won eight yards, and Hes
ton had made thirty yards round
Cooper's end on a delayed pass.
Michigan was using all her tricks
now, for Stanford had been play
ing surprising football. That first
touchdown was made through
* ~«<»velt in a one-yard buck by

stanlly punted it back to the mid
dle of the field. Then Stanford
began a most persistant assault
upon Michigan. Fisher, Slaker
1 raeger, McFadden and McGii'
-V£a£ur6e yards at every
try, and then lost the ball on a
•fumble near the thirty-five-yard
line.
"Sweeley punted over to Stan
ford's thirty-five-yard line and
Fisher kicked it back twenty-five
yards on first down. Then Swee
ley returned the kick on first down
with a beautiful punt for fifty-seven
yards over Stanford's goal line
McFadden took the free kick for
the twenty-five-yard line over to
Michigan's forty-five-yard line.
Sweeley ran it back twenty yards,
with forty yards to go. Michigan
began a terrible attack, and in
twenty plays carried the ball to
within those four inches of Stan
ford's goal and there had to give it
up. Traeger was playing a beauti
ful game. Three times already he
had broken through Shorts and
tackled behind Michigan's line,and
Traeger was a convalescent from a
sick bed and his right arm was
badly injured before the game.
" 'Traeger,' called out Yost, 'you
played the best I ever saw you
play,' and Traeger's team-mates
were quite certain that Traeger had
done better than the wonderful

Shorts, who Yost had predicted
would ' eat Traeger up.'
"In the first half Michigan made
17 points, but in the second the
score was increased by 32. The
contest became largely a Michigan
opportunity, with very few chances
for Stanford."
Early in the second half McGil
vray caught a punt, but larpey
got in his way. While they were
stepping aside for each other they
missed it, and Redden came upon
them, grabbed the fumbled ball,
and had a clear field.
The line-up was as follows:
