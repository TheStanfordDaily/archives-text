# AFTERMATH OF DEFEAT.
## How Trainer, Coach, and Captain Were Impressed By the Michigan Contest. 
### 
In regard to the late Michigan-
Stanford football game, "Dad''
Moulton, trainer of the team, was
interviewed today. He said:
"The boys were up against as fast
an aggregation, and as good a team,
as I ever saw. The fact that for
the first part of the game it looked
as though we had the best of it,
only shows that we had men of
whom we can be proud. Michigan
had not been out of training
the whole season, while we had
been in training practically not
more than ten days. The result
was at once apparent. We couldn't
stand the terrific smashing of those
bull-dog tighters. After they had
laid out our best men they had
everything their own way.
"It was by far the best game we
have played this year. Most of the
boys were game, dead game, and
fought on, though some of them
were suffering terrible pain. Baird,
the Michigan manager, told me
that he would like to see an annual
game between Stanford and Mich
igan. He said that our team was
as good as any they had gone up
against this year, and felt confident
that we could have beaten Carlisle
Indians easily.
"I want to give credit to Frank
Slaker for his coaching of the team.
He made it what it was. If it hadn't
been for bis work we could never in
the world have held them up the
way we did, when they were coming
down the field in the first half."
Frank Slaker, when asked con
cerning the game, expressed him
self thus:
"I was well pleased with what the
fellows did. Every one worked
hard. It was bad luck that so
many men were hurt early in the
game. We lacked endurance. Our
men 'trained conscientiously and
consistently, and one could ask for
nothing better. Their training dur
ing the vacation showed in the
game. The football played in the
first half was the kind of football I
had not seen since being in the
West. It was more like real East
ern football, faster and more busi
nesslike. Everything moved along
quietly and smoothly, and everyone
got in and played hard ball. For
a time during the first half I
thought that we would surely score,
as did Coach Yost also. The peo
ple at the Hotel Green, and also
the Michigan men themselves, were
extremely kind to the team,and we
appreciated their treatment of us
very much."
Captain Ralph Fisher says:
"Ii has been my good fortune to
be on several trips the Stanford
team has taken for training pur
poses, Itiit I can candidly say that
never before has so profitable and
pleasant a jaunt taken place as
that of the Stanford team this va
cation. I do not believe a more
conscientious lot of fellows was
ever brought together, and we cer
tainly took advantage of the ten
days' training to get in as good
shape as was possible. There was
not a man on the team who did
not keep the student training rules.

Every man, and the team as a
whole, did nothing but play foot
hall, and I think I am safe in say
ing that the team played a forty
per cent, better game than in the
Intercollegiate contest with Berke
ley. Nor was it through any lack
of knowledge of the game that we
were defeated, hut through lack of
endurance due to our short period
of training. We were compelled to
wait thirty minutes in the hot sun
for the Michigan team, who were
late, every man being nerved to the
highest pitch. This was equal to
twenty minutes of hard playing.
"All our men went into the game
with a grim determination to tight
until carried off the field, and every
Stanford man who went out played
until he was unable to stand.
Roosevelt is the nerviest man that
ever donned a football suit. He
had his leg fractured on the sixth
down, and continued to play for
fifteen minutes while in that con
dition. With the ball on the one
foot line, he not only successfully
blocked two plays aimed at him,
but be forced them back, and only
consented to go out of the game
when he lay in a heap with two
ribs broken. Treager also played
ten minutes with a helpless right
arm. Clark went into the game
and played the firmest of any man
on the team as long as he lasted,
although he was on crutches until
the day before the game.
"Our greatest weakness lay in my
punting and in our handling of
their punts. They out-punted us
about ten yards each time. I
do not consider the Michigan
team a stronger team than Stan
ford individually, but their superior
physical condition won them the
game. Lee, Thompson, and Mc-
Fadden easily held their men. To
Frank Slaker is due the greatest
credit for spirit in the preparation
for the contest und for the consist
ency of bis game. Although Stan
ford lost the game, I think it was of
the greatest benefit to Western ath
letics."

had not seen since being in the
West. It was more like real East
ern football, faster and more busi
nesslike. Everything moved along
quietly and smoothly, and everyone
got in and played hard ball. For
a time during the first half I
thought that we would surely score,
as did Coach Yost also. The peo
ple at the Hotel Green, and also
the Michigan men themselves, were
extremely kind to the team,and we
appreciated their treatment of us
very much."
Captain Ralph Fisher says:
"Ii has been my good fortune to
be on several trips the Stanford
team has taken for training pur
poses, Itiit I can candidly say that
never before has so profitable and
pleasant a jaunt taken place as
that of the Stanford team this va
cation. I do not believe a more
conscientious lot of fellows was
ever brought together, and we cer
tainly took advantage of the ten
days' training to get in as good
shape as was possible. There was
not a man on the team who did
not keep the student training rules.

Every man, and the team as a
whole, did nothing but play foot
hall, and I think I am safe in say
ing that the team played a forty
per cent, better game than in the
Intercollegiate contest with Berke
ley. Nor was it through any lack
of knowledge of the game that we
were defeated, hut through lack of
endurance due to our short period
of training. We were compelled to
wait thirty minutes in the hot sun
for the Michigan team, who were
late, every man being nerved to the
highest pitch. This was equal to
twenty minutes of hard playing.
"All our men went into the game
with a grim determination to tight
until carried off the field, and every
Stanford man who went out played
until he was unable to stand.
Roosevelt is the nerviest man that
ever donned a football suit. He
had his leg fractured on the sixth
down, and continued to play for
fifteen minutes while in that con
dition. With the ball on the one
foot line, he not only successfully
blocked two plays aimed at him,
but be forced them back, and only
consented to go out of the game
when he lay in a heap with two
ribs broken. Treager also played
ten minutes with a helpless right
arm. Clark went into the game
and played the firmest of any man
on the team as long as he lasted,
although he was on crutches until
the day before the game.
"Our greatest weakness lay in my
punting and in our handling of
their punts. They out-punted us
about ten yards each time. I
do not consider the Michigan
team a stronger team than Stan
ford individually, but their superior
physical condition won them the
game. Lee, Thompson, and Mc-
Fadden easily held their men. To
Frank Slaker is due the greatest
credit for spirit in the preparation
for the contest und for the consist
ency of bis game. Although Stan
ford lost the game, I think it was of
the greatest benefit to Western ath
letics."
In regard to the late Michigan-
Stanford football game, "Dad''
Moulton, trainer of the team, was
interviewed today. He said:
"The boys were up against as fast
an aggregation, and as good a team,
as I ever saw. The fact that for
the first part of the game it looked
as though we had the best of it,
only shows that we had men of
whom we can be proud. Michigan
had not been out of training
the whole season, while we had
been in training practically not
more than ten days. The result
was at once apparent. We couldn't
stand the terrific smashing of those
bull-dog tighters. After they had
laid out our best men they had
everything their own way.
"It was by far the best game we
have played this year. Most of the
boys were game, dead game, and
fought on, though some of them
were suffering terrible pain. Baird,
the Michigan manager, told me
that he would like to see an annual
game between Stanford and Mich
igan. He said that our team was
as good as any they had gone up
against this year, and felt confident
that we could have beaten Carlisle
Indians easily.
"I want to give credit to Frank
Slaker for his coaching of the team.
He made it what it was. If it hadn't
been for bis work we could never in
the world have held them up the
way we did, when they were coming
down the field in the first half."
Frank Slaker, when asked con
cerning the game, expressed him
self thus:
"I was well pleased with what the
fellows did. Every one worked
hard. It was bad luck that so
many men were hurt early in the
game. We lacked endurance. Our
men 'trained conscientiously and
consistently, and one could ask for
nothing better. Their training dur
ing the vacation showed in the
game. The football played in the
first half was the kind of football I
had not seen since being in the
West. It was more like real East
