# Yost on Michigan's Record.

### 
In giving a review of the record
made by the Michigan team during
the past season, Coach Yost said:
•' The Michigan team smashed
more football reeoids this year
than any other team in the history
of the game. Ln the first place, the
score of 501 to 0 will long stand as
the high-water mark in football
scoring during a single season. But
this high score is not the only rec

ord Michigan has made this year,
fur the score of 128 to 0 against
Buffalo stands as the highest one
ever run up between colleges.
Michigan's smallest score, that of
21 to 0 against Ohio State, is larger
than the smallest score any team
has gone through the entire season
with. Of all the teams opposing
her, hut one was able to secure a
single one of its punts, showing the
tine work of our ends and tackles.
The fullback lias been called upon
but once in the course of the season
to make a tackle; this was when
Merrill of Beloit got around end
for fifteen yards on a fake kick.
The longest gain of the season
against Michigan was this same
fifteen-yard run of Merrill's.
Michigan averaged 50 points a
game, not quite one a minute. The
same eleven men played in every
game of the season, not a single
player being injured or laid up for
more than a day, something which
speaks well for Dr. Fitzpatrick's
excellent training.
"1 attribute the success of the
team to several things —to the age,
weight, and speed of the individual
players, to good defense, to splen
did team work, to the speed with
which all the plays were executed,
and to good training. The men
were of the right age; all were ovsr
20, and the average for the team
was 22. The weight of the men
was about right, and well distrib
uted; the team's average per player
was 179 pounds stripped. As for
speed, all of the men except one
were able to run a hundred yards
under 11 seconds.
"Since ten of the eleven men
were used to carry the ball, and
called upon alternately to do so,
the work was so distributed that at
the end of a game the men were
comparatively fresh. Then we had
the best punter in the country to
help advance the ball. Sweely's
punts averaged over forty yards for
the season. Kernan of Harvard,
who is considered the best punter
in the East, was able to make an
average of only thirty-three yards
in the Yale-Harvard game. To
show something of the relative
speed of Michigan and Harvard,
we can take for consideration the
Michigan-lowa and Yale-Harvard
games. On Thanksgiving day at
Chicago Michigan executed 216
plays in seventy minutes, while on
the same day Harvard ran off only
146 in seventy minutes of play,
which shows that Michigan was i>o
per cent faster than Harvard. This
shows also that Michigan executed
over three plays a minute, and,
when time is taken out for posses
sion of the ball by lowa, it can
readily be seen that she made as
high as five or six plays a minute.
" Michigan's work on the defen
sive has been excellent all season.
Four of the teams opposing her
were unable to carry the ball into
or play in her half of the gridiron
during their games. Chicago made
but one play in Michigan's terri
tory, and in the last three games
her opponents made their first
downs hut seven times. During
the season Michigan made 87
touchdowns, kicked 61 goals from
touchdowns, and one goal from the
field."
