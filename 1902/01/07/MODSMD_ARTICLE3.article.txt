# Musical Clubs Concert.
## 
### 
The Pasadena Opera House was
crowded Wednesday evening after
the big Michigan-Stanford football
game when the combined musical
clubs of Stanford gave their con
cert. Most of the football men
were present, including Roosevelt,
who hobbled about on crutches,
and Traeger with his arm in a
sling. The majority of the Cardinal
supporters who had come to Pasa
dena to witness the football game
stayed to hear the concert. The
clubs will arrive at the University
on the eleventh.
