# HORSES TO BE SOLD.
## Famous Palo Alto Stock Farm, Established In 1877, Will Be Closed. 
### 
The Palo Alto Stock Farm, which
has produced many world famous
horses, and which is now a part of
the University endowment, will
soon lie closed. An order has been
issued from the business ollice di
recting that all the stock be sold,
and in compliance with this Super
intendent Covey will place about
250 head of horses on the market.
The first sale will be in San Fran
cisco January 30th, and the last
one takes place in New York in
November. Ten of the brood mares
which have contributed to the fame
of Palo Alto will be retained and
pensioned, together with the saddle
horse that formerly belonged to Ice
land Stanford Jr.
Senator Stanford started the farm
in 1877, with the intention of estab
lishing a long string of thorough
bred trotting horses, and the estab
lishment has been run in pursuance
of this idea ever since. Beginning
with only forty or fifty, it grew
steadily until, in 1893, the year
Senator Stanford died, there were
1350 horses here and at the branch
at Vina. Since that time the num
ber has been decreased. The de
velopment was discontinued in
1896, and no entries have been
made in the races since 1898.
Few Stanford students realize
the wonderful records that have
been made by horses bred on the
Stock Farm. No stallion in the
world has such a line of notable
descendants as Electioneer, who
died in 1890. In 1892 every trotting
record in the world was held by his
sons and daughters. Palo Alto,
Senator Stanford's favorite horse,
made the stallion trotting record,
with a high-wheeled sulky, of 2:08f.
Waxann, one of the ten horses
which will be retained, trotted a
mile to a high-wheel sulky in
which has been a world's record
never since broken. The Abbot
trotted a mile in and is ex
celled by only one trotting horse in
the world, Croesus. "King of
Trotters."
It is not yet known what will be
done with the farm, but it will
probably he turned into some pro
ductive purpose.
