# Orchestra to Meet Thursday.
## 
### 
There will be a regular meeting
and rehearsal of the University
Orchestra on Thursday evening,
January 9th, at 7:30, in the chapel.
All old members and others wish
ing to work with the Orchestra are
requested to be on hand. An im
portant part of the work of the Or
chestra for the coming semester
will consist in the study of the
music for the coining performance
of the " Antigone" to lie given by
the department of Greek. The
music is by Mendelssohn and is
one of the strongest and most dra
matic of his compositions. In ad
dition to this, it, is desired to give a
concert in the near future. A
prompt beginning of rehearsals for
the semester is therefore necessary,
and it is hoped that the attend
ance on Thursday evening will be
large.
