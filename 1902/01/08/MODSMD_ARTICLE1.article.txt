# BY STANFORD PROFESSORS.
## Many Important Topics Discussed at the Pacific Grove Teachers' Convention. 
### 
The annual convention of the
California Council of Education
was held at Pacific Grove Decem
ber 30th to January 3d, and many
members of the Stanford faculty
were prominent on the program.
The relation of the high school
to the university was discussed by
Dr. O. P. Jenkins, who also con
ducted the sessions of the depart
ment of nature study.
Prof. A. B. Clark of Stanford
spoke on "Drawing in the High
School," affirming that drawing is
still the primary subject.
Of addresses made by Professor
Alden and President Jordan, one
report says:
"Professor Raymond A. Alden of
Stanford University read an inter
esting paper on 'The Appreciation
of Poetry.'' He said that apprecia
tion depends in a large measure
upon ability to catch the sensuous
qualities of the rhythm, to give
oneself over to the poetic mood of
the poet, and to see the relation of
poetry to truth. He suggested that
children be taught to feel poetry
rather than to analyze it, and he
deprecated the use of modern edi
tions supplied with notes, charac
terizing them as a hindrance rather
than a help to the youthful mind.
" President Jordan addressed the
high school department on 'The
Place of the High School in the
State School System.' He stated
that high schools should have an
individuality of their own, and
should give the youth a training
for life. They should not be
merely preparatory schools for the
university, nor should the univer
sities be permitted to dictate their
courses of instruction.
"'Let the high schools give their
pupils what they consider a good
all-round education,' said Dr. Jor
dan. 'Let the university then
take each young man in hand, find
out what he is fitted for, in what
respects his education is erroneous
or deficient, then correct the errors
and supply the deficiencies.'
" Dr. Jordan advocated the dem
ocracy of education. He suggested
that there be no compulsory
branches of study save those of
English and mathematics, but that
all branches be tried upon their
merits. Incidentally, the speaker
deprecated strongly the compul
sory study of Latin, a language
which he thought had usurped in
the past an importance due to tra
dition.
"'There are many other kinds
of culture more useful,' said Dr.
Jordan. ' Modern languages ure
better branches of study than dead
ones, but if one must choose a dead
language, why not take Greek. It,
is a far finer and more useful basis
of cultivation than Latin.'"
Dr. Jordan, later, spoke on
" Higher Education, Old and New,"
and a review of his remarks says:
" The most striking characteristic
of the American system of educa
tion, be believed, was its want of
system. High schools and tech
nical schools arose from the desire
of the people for them. 'Ouredu

cational system,' he continued, 'is
always passing through a transi
tion or chrysalis state. Already
the institutions of Europe are
looking to America to see what
they can learn.
'"The American idea is to make
a man stand on his own feet. Ed
ucation in England formerly was
simply the education of gentlemen
and clergymen. Latin was the
chief study, and pedantry resulted.
Every period of the world is a
period of great awakening. Her
bert Spencer crying in the wilder
ness first broke up old ideas. Clas
sical education was one of the
things he cried out most vigorously
and successfully against. TJie uni
versity was the place where noth
ing useful was taught. A college
degree was the budge of having
done the proper thing. Oxford
woke up to find its men were not
scholars, and its scholars were not
men. It would be as regrettable to
make the study of science a fetish
as it was in the past to make a
fetish of the study of Latin. To
furnish any person instruction in
any study is the true function of a
university. Technical schools tend
to bring the element, of reality into
work. Co-education is a strong
point in American university
life.'"
The closing sessions were given
almost wholly to the departments
of History and Drawing. A paper
on "What Not to Do," was read by
Professor Bolton C. Brown of the
Stanford faculty.
Speaking of this final session, the
San Francisco Chronicle of last
Saturday said:
"Great interest was aroused
among members of the association
this morning by the developments
of history department papers. Un
stinted criticism was pronounced
against the note-book system now
in use in this State, especially with
reference to the requirements for
entrance to Stanford University.
"Edith Jordan, daughter of
David Starr Jordan, read a paper
on "The History Note-Book."
The note-book, she said, adds in
terest to text-book work, but it is
sometimes overestimated as a re
quirement for entrance to univer
sities."
Dr. C. Benjamin, Chancellor of
the University of Nebraska, Profes
sor M. V. O'Shea, of the University
of Wisconsin, President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, of the University of
California, and President David
Starr Jordan of Stanford, were
guests of honor at a reception in
the Hotel Del Monte, New Year's
night.

Stanford University read an inter
esting paper on 'The Appreciation
of Poetry.'' He said that apprecia
tion depends in a large measure
upon ability to catch the sensuous
qualities of the rhythm, to give
oneself over to the poetic mood of
the poet, and to see the relation of
poetry to truth. He suggested that
children be taught to feel poetry
rather than to analyze it, and he
deprecated the use of modern edi
tions supplied with notes, charac
terizing them as a hindrance rather
than a help to the youthful mind.
" President Jordan addressed the
high school department on 'The
Place of the High School in the
State School System.' He stated
that high schools should have an
individuality of their own, and
should give the youth a training
for life. They should not be
merely preparatory schools for the
university, nor should the univer
sities be permitted to dictate their
courses of instruction.
"'Let the high schools give their
pupils what they consider a good
all-round education,' said Dr. Jor
dan. 'Let the university then
take each young man in hand, find
out what he is fitted for, in what
respects his education is erroneous
or deficient, then correct the errors
and supply the deficiencies.'
" Dr. Jordan advocated the dem
ocracy of education. He suggested
that there be no compulsory
branches of study save those of
English and mathematics, but that
all branches be tried upon their
merits. Incidentally, the speaker
deprecated strongly the compul
sory study of Latin, a language
which he thought had usurped in
the past an importance due to tra
dition.
"'There are many other kinds
of culture more useful,' said Dr.
Jordan. ' Modern languages ure
better branches of study than dead
ones, but if one must choose a dead
language, why not take Greek. It,
is a far finer and more useful basis
of cultivation than Latin.'"
Dr. Jordan, later, spoke on
" Higher Education, Old and New,"
and a review of his remarks says:
" The most striking characteristic
of the American system of educa
tion, be believed, was its want of
system. High schools and tech
nical schools arose from the desire
of the people for them. 'Ouredu

cational system,' he continued, 'is
always passing through a transi
tion or chrysalis state. Already
the institutions of Europe are
looking to America to see what
they can learn.
'"The American idea is to make
a man stand on his own feet. Ed
ucation in England formerly was
simply the education of gentlemen
and clergymen. Latin was the
chief study, and pedantry resulted.
Every period of the world is a
period of great awakening. Her
bert Spencer crying in the wilder
ness first broke up old ideas. Clas
sical education was one of the
things he cried out most vigorously
and successfully against. TJie uni
versity was the place where noth
ing useful was taught. A college
degree was the budge of having
done the proper thing. Oxford
woke up to find its men were not
scholars, and its scholars were not
men. It would be as regrettable to
make the study of science a fetish
as it was in the past to make a
fetish of the study of Latin. To
furnish any person instruction in
any study is the true function of a
university. Technical schools tend
to bring the element, of reality into
work. Co-education is a strong
point in American university
life.'"
The closing sessions were given
almost wholly to the departments
of History and Drawing. A paper
on "What Not to Do," was read by
Professor Bolton C. Brown of the
Stanford faculty.
Speaking of this final session, the
San Francisco Chronicle of last
Saturday said:
"Great interest was aroused
among members of the association
this morning by the developments
of history department papers. Un
stinted criticism was pronounced
against the note-book system now
in use in this State, especially with
reference to the requirements for
entrance to Stanford University.
"Edith Jordan, daughter of
David Starr Jordan, read a paper
on "The History Note-Book."
The note-book, she said, adds in
terest to text-book work, but it is
sometimes overestimated as a re
quirement for entrance to univer
sities."
Dr. C. Benjamin, Chancellor of
the University of Nebraska, Profes
sor M. V. O'Shea, of the University
of Wisconsin, President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, of the University of
California, and President David
Starr Jordan of Stanford, were
guests of honor at a reception in
the Hotel Del Monte, New Year's
night.
The annual convention of the
California Council of Education
was held at Pacific Grove Decem
ber 30th to January 3d, and many
members of the Stanford faculty
were prominent on the program.
The relation of the high school
to the university was discussed by
Dr. O. P. Jenkins, who also con
ducted the sessions of the depart
ment of nature study.
Prof. A. B. Clark of Stanford
spoke on "Drawing in the High
School," affirming that drawing is
still the primary subject.
