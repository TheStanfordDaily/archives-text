Players and observers are unan
imous in their opinion that Stan
ford was able to make her strong
showing in the early part of the
Michigan game largely because of
the coaching done by Frank Slaker.
At Pasadena before New Year's
day he gave the benefit of his ex
tensive experience in the game both
East and West, and succeeded in
developing team work that enabled
our men to hold their own for a
time against the great eleven from
Ann Arbor. While we are casting
about for available future coaches
the choice of Slaker for next year
seems to be tlie logical one.
