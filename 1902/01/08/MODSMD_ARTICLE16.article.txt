# Century Prize Stories.
## 
### 
The Century Company is to dis
continue its annual prizes for liter
ary efforts by newly made college
graduates, as the results have been
very meagre during the four years

of competition. The current num
ber of the Century Magazine con
tains the productions of the prize
winners of the class of 1900. The
story, "The Poppies In the Wheat,"
is by Katherine Fullerton, of Rad
cliffe College; the essay, "Huxley
as a Literary Man," by James E.
Itouth, of John Hopkins; and the
poem, "Octaeon," by John Erskire,
of Columbia.
