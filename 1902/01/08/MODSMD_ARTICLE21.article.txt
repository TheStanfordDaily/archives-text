# Organ Recital in Vacation.
## 
### 
As announced l>y the organist,
Mr. Scott-Brook, no more organ
recitals will be given at the Memo
rial Church until further notice.
The advancement of the work on
the interior of the building makes
it necessary for the contractors to
refuse further admission to visitors.
The recitals have been an unfail
ing attraction, and even in vaca
tion there were from twenty-five
to fifty people in the choir loft
every evening. Those present New
Year's evening were pleasantly sur
prised by three solos, "The Holy
City," "The Palms," and "Cal
vary," by Mr. Edgar Hobart of
Palo Alto. On a recent occasion
Mr. Hobart sang for several mem
bers of the Grau Opera Company,
and received much praise for the
manner in which he used his excel
lent dramatic tenor voice.
