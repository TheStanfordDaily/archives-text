# Vacation On the Campus.
## 
### 
Although not many students re
mained on the campus during the
vacation, those who did amused
themselves with short trips and im
protnptu parties, and report a good
time generally. There were fewer
men in Encina than last year, and
the absence of the football team,
Glee Club, and those who attended
the game at Pasadena, reduced the
number considerably. Several men
went to work in the Museum at the
beginning of vacation, expecting to
be employed for more than two
weeks. They worked so vigorously,
however, that at the end of three
days there was so little to do that
most of them were let out.
Among the changes accomplished
on the campus were the substitu
tion of the large Roman cross for
the smaller Greek one on top of the
Memorial Church, and the placing
of iron gates at the big arch and at
the east and west entrances to the
quadrangle; and with the close of
the year the Chinese restaurant in
the Camp went out of existence.
Perhaps the most interesting item
of news developed was the an
nouncement of the engagement of
Miss Pearson and Mr. Bartlett,

which occasioned a good deal of
surprise.
The Thetas gave an impromptu
dance one evening, and the Delta
Gammas gave small dinner parties
on Christmas and New Year's.
Christmas eve the Phi Delta Thetas
had an informal dance, and there
was a Christmas tree at Iloble.
Christmas night several University
and Manzanita students gave a
party at Castilleja. On New Year's
eve the Betas had a masque hall,
and a watch party took place at
Roble. During the vacation two
parties of students went over to
Portola.
Encina men organized two scrub
baseball teams, and played a game
last Thursday.
The lloble dining - room was
thrown open to transients, and a
few of the men boarded there, while
others went to Palo Alto and May
field for their meals.
Some faculty appointments were
announced, and altogether the
season was not as uneventful as
those who were away may suppose.
