# STUDENTS' CONFERENCE.
## Report of Sixth Annual Convention Held at Pacific Grove During Vacation. 
### 
The sixth annual session of the
Pacific Coast Students Y. M. C. A.
Conference convened at Pacific
Grove during the last ten days of
the Christmas vacation. It was
probably the most successful session
ever held this side of Lake Geneva,
Wisconsin, where the conference of
the Middle West universities is
held. The other two conferences,
conducted under the direction of
the Students' Department of the
International Committee, are at
Northfield, Mass., and Asheville,
N. C. There were eighty-six men in
attendance at the Pacific Grove
session this year, representing nine
teen institutions in the states of
Idaho, Washington, Oregon and
California. Three delegates from
Idaho and Whitman College, Wash
ington, came over twelve hundred
miles. In numbers Berkeley headed
the list with a delegation of thirty
five men. Occidental and Pomona,
two small colleges of Southern Cal
ifornia, were next. Stanford sent
only six men, notwithstanding the
fact that it cost less than half the
amount necessary to attend from
Southern California, and that the
student body is second largest in
the State.
The delegates seemed to be a
picked lot of men.prominent in their
college life, and representative of
almost every field of college activity.
To this fact is largely due the suc
cess of the Conference. However,
there were other factors, chief
among them being the ability of
the leaders, and the uniform power
of the platform addresses. It is a
testimony to the high estimate
placed upon the Conference that
such men as Dr. Wallser and Dr.
E. S. Chapman, of Los Angeles, Dr.
F. W. Clampett, Dr. E. E. Baker
and Dr. E. R. Dille, from San Fran
cisco and Oakland, leave their work
and give from two to five days to
the service of the college men. The
addresses delivered dealt almost en
tirely with the fundamental prob
lems of religious conduct and faith.
One of the most stirring addresses
was that delivered by President
Wheeler, of California. He said,
among other things: "The Y. M.
C. A. is, without any doubt, the
most powerful and effective agency
among the most powerful class of
the world, namely, the young men."
He paid the very highest tribute to
the work of Mr. Mott, who, he be
lieved, was doing more for humani
ty than any other man under the
sun.
Every one at the Conference re
ceived a lasting impression from
the strong, manly appeal of Mr. E.
T. Colton, the International secre
tary, for the men to "run up the
flag of unselfishness, and to make
no compromise with sin and evil in
college and personal life." One of
the most memorable and impressive
occasions was the Life-Work Ses
sion, held on the beach, around the
log lire, in memory of 11. W. Hose.
ATHLETIC FEATURES.
Not an unimportant feature of
the ten days is the intercollegiate
athletics each afternoon. The base
ball series was won by Berkeley. In
the Field-Day, however, California
was defeated by Occidental, which
institution had some strong ath
letes. Cleland and Cadwalader
outran, in the mile and half mile,

both Service and Rediwill,of Berke
ley, who took first and second in
the Intercollegiate last April. â€¢ The
final score in the Field-Day was:
Occidental, 39; Berkeley, 18; Stan
ford, 12.
Speaking of the benefits from the
Conference, Secretary Harter, of the
local Y. M. C. A., says:"It is hard
to express just what makes these
gatherings of college men mean so
much to them. It seems that all the
knowledge which is gained at uni
versities is cold, and needs the
warmth of a strong motive, a high
born conviction, a -vision of possi
bilities, and a realization of world
needs. Truth is ineffective and
dead without love. A good ex
pression of what the Conference is
meaning to men is found in the
words of one of the University
men, 'I never knew before that I
had so much in my breast, and
never realized that the world had
so great a need for it.'"
