# WANTS TIME EXTENDED.
## Washington Asks That Question be Submitted Twelve Weeks Before Debate. 
### 
This afternoon the Intersociety
Executive Committee met to con
sider the requests made by the Un
iversity of Washington Debating
Committee for certain changes in
the proposed agreement for a con
test to be held here next April and
another one at Seattle the follow
ing year. The reduction in tiie
length of time for the rebuttal
speech from ten to eight minutes,
and the explanation gf the defini
tion of persons eligible to compete,
were conceded according to the re
quest. Washington, however,
asked that the question be submit
ted twelve weeks before the time
for debate. The proposed agree
ment was for this to be done only
six weeks beforehand, and the com
mittee decided that it must insist
upon the original plan owing to
the schedule of debates already ar
ranged here, and the danger of in
terfering with the Intercollegiate
with California. C. D. McComish,
of the Intercollegiate Committee,
was instructed to notify Washing
ton accordingly.
