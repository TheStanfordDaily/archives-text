Some one suggests that the min
ute hand on each of the four new
clock faces for the Memorial Church
steeples be set differently. Uni
formity of time on the campus
might be an innovation to which
students could not adjust them
selves at once. Perhaps it would
be convenient for all concerned, es
pecially early in the day, if the face
next the quadrangle were slower
than the others.
