# Trip Down the Colorado River.
## 
### 
Prof. V. L. Kellogg took a very
interesting trip down the Colorado
River through the Colorado-Mojave
Desert during the hdidays. Mr.
W. W. Price, '97, head master of
Agassiz Hall, AlUi, California, con
ducted the party, which consisted
of nine persons. They started from
The Needles with two rather heavy
row-boats and a canvas canoe, and
finished the trip to Yuma, a dis
tance of three hundred miles, in
fourteen days, without encounter
ing any dangers or meeting with
any noteworthy adventures. The
water at that time of year is at its
lowest stage, and the whirlpools
and rapids of the canons offered no
danger to the boats. A sandstorm
held the party closely in camp for
a day. They spent several days
tramping and climbing in the des
ert, and took many photographs of
the desert mountains, of the cliffs
and rocks of the river canons, and
of the desert vegetation, such as
cacti and yuccas. The season of
the year was unfavorable for col
lecting, and they secured but few
specimens of birds, mammals, and
insects. They shot geese, ducks,
and quail, but saw no large game.
The valleys coming down to either
bank of the river are inhabited by
Indians of four tribes, the Mojaves,
the Chemehuevis, the Yumas, and
the Cocopahs, who live in small
villages and rancherias. The
mountains along the river, belong
ing to five ranges, Mojave, Mon
ument, Riverside, Chocolate, and
Purple, offered marvelous pictures
of beautifully colored but utterly
bare and fantastically carved rocks.
Professor Kellogg says it was alto
gether a trip of fascinating interest,
and one that is not difficult for any
lover of outings to undertake.
