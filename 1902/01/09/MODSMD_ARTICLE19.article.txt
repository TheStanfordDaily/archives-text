# Dr. Jordan on Future of Pacific.
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan contri
buted an article to the New Year's
supplement of the San Francisco
Examiner in which he discussed
the importance of the Pacific
Ocean as the theatre of future world
politics. He said that the lands
bordering on the Atlantic have
been settled already, and the Paci
fic must be the scene of adventure
and trade-seeking of the great na
tions, and that the pres6nce of the
United States among these will
have a restraining influence on
these.
The new conquests are to be con
quests of peace. The Pacific must
be all that its name implies â€”peace-
ful. Its triumphs must be tri
umphs of commerce. Success in
commerce depends on good will and
honest dealing, and this implies
fair treatment of one another by
the nations in competition. China
must be raised to the dignity of a
nation, and then the ''yellow peril"
will be history.
To deal honestly, a good article
at a reasonable price is essential.
A good article is usually the pro
duct of science, and hence the need
for training in the applied sciences
in American universities.
