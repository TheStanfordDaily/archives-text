### 
Professor Mary Roberts Smith,
who is spending a year's leave of
absence in New York City, has
sent to the Daily Palo Alto cir
culars published by the Association
of Collegiate Alumnae and the
Woman's Education Association.
They contain offers of foreign fellow
ships to woman graduates of colleges
belonging to the association. The
first one reads:
"The Association of Collegiate
Alumnae is desirous of encouraging
the pursuit of advanced courses of
study among women graduates of
colleges. It therefore proposes to
devote five hundred dollars every
year toward paying the expenses of
some young woman who wishes to
carry on her studies in a foreign
country. Applications for this
fellowship will be received by any
member of the committee having it
in charge. The candidates must be
graduates of colleges belonging to
the association, and applications
for 1902-1903 must be handed
in before February 1, 1902. The
fellowship will be awarded only to
candidates who give promise of dis
tinction in the subjects to which
they devote themselves. It will be
the aim of the committee to ap
point the candidate who is best
fitted for the position through orig
inal gifts, previous training,energy,
power of endurance, and health.
To this end they will receive appli
cations in writing from eligible
candidates, who will present, as
clearly aw possible, their claims to
the fellowship. A competitive ex
amination will not be held, but the
bestowal of the fellowship will be
based upon evidence of the candi
date's ability, and of her prospect
of success in her chosen line of
study. Such evidence will natur
ally consist of («) her college di
ploma; (b) testimonials as to super
ior ability and high character from
her professors and other qualified
judges; (c) satisfactory evidence
of thoroughly good health; (d) a
statement of the work in which she
proposes to engage subsequently;
hint, and of chief importance, ex
amples of her scientific or literary
work in the form of papers or
articles, or accounts of scientific in
vestigations which she has carried
out. The fellowship will not usu
ally be granted to those who are
intending to take up the practice
of any of the three learned pro
fessions, though such are not form
ally excluded from the competition;
it will rather be bestowed upon those
who are looking forward to positions
as professors and teachers and to
literary and scientific vocations.
Preference will be given, other
things being equal, to graduates of
not more than live years' standing.
The fellowship will in general be
held for one year; but in an unusu
ally promising case the term may
lie extended at the discretion of the
committee."
