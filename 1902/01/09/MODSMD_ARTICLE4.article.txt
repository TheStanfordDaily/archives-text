# New Electric Lamp.
## 
### 
The Electrical Engineering de
partment has received two of the
famous Nernst lamps, the first sent
to the Pacific Coast. This lamp is
of great practical and scientific
interest to the electrical engineering
profession, as it will displace, to a
certain extent, the "arc" and "in
candescent" lamps. It may be
seen in operation any afternoon
next week in room 120.
