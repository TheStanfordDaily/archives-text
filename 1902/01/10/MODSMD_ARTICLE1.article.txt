# TRACK OUTLOOK.
## Work Commences Next Week. Training Rules Will Be Strictly Enforced. 
### 
Active work will commence on
the track next week, and during
the present semester Stanford may
expect to see a complete revolution
in the methods for training and
selecting of members of the track
team. After the last field-day with
Berkeley it was evident to all who
had witnessed those events that
there was something extremely
weak in our system, not alone in
the coaching but in the manner of
training. Along with this convic
tion of a necessary change has come
"Dad" Moulton, with a life-time's
successful experince in athletics,
holding the men to a more rigid ob
servace of training than has ever
before been enforced or observed
here. Gaptain McGaughern, him
self a hard and consistent trainer,
will co-operate to the fullest extent
with Trainer Moulton in maintain
ing a high standard among the
men. Both Trainer Moulton and
Gaptain McGaughern want nothing
to do with the man who does not
keep training rules; it makes no
difference if he can break every
record in the catalogue, "Dad 11 says
he would rather have one man con
sistently trained than forty who
are not. Adherence to these rules
must be the underlying principle
upon which Stanford may expect
to produce a team to meet Berkeley
in April. The men will be taken
care of by as good a trainee as ever
wore spikes. Special attention will
be given to every one who appears
for work, and he may expect the
best treatment ever accorded to a
track man in Stanford, both from
the trainers and from the manage
ment.
The track will be covered with
cinders almost immediately, and
will be kept in first-class condition
as long as the season lasts. A
training-table will be started later
in the semester, and the men will
then be dieted under the direct
supervision of the trainer.
In speaking of the prospects Mr.
Moulton was quoted, last semester
in t he Daily Palo Alto, as saying:
"They are good, but every one can
help bv getting 011 the track him
self, or by giving encouragement to
those who are out."
Galifornia has a fine lot of ath
letes, almost all of them old men in
their events. There are good per
formers in every event, Cadogan
and Higda in the sprints, Service
in the distances, Powell and Wolsey
in the hurdles, Plaw in the weights,
Powell and Gooley in the jumps,
and Heater, the Oregon man, in the
pole-vault. Stanford expects to
develop some record breakers —in
this Moulton has been most, success
ful —but it. is still too early in the
season to forcast who they will be.
The performances of the men in the
lield-day last semester were highly
satisfactory, considering that near
ly all of those who entered were
new men. In the sprints, the hun
dred, and the two-twenty, we have
promising material to develop,
some of which has already shown
itself to be excellent. Bubb, Ham
ilton, and G. McGaughern may be

expected to do better than last year.
T. McCaughern, Kitching, Kehr
lein, and a half-dozen others will
try hard for places on the team.
In the quarter are Hoi man, Dunn,
Smith, and Hawley, with Sevier,
Hyde, and Grossman, who have
good chances to make records. By
the sickness of Sprague the team
sustained the loss of a man who
would have given Service a rub for
first place in the distances. As it
is Chadbourne and Nangle are the
only old men left. Davis, Swiner
ton, McLaughlin, and Harper
showed up well last semester. There
are three long runs to be made, and
there should be a much larger num
ber of candidates out for the posi
tions. Kuhn, Naramore, and Tay
lor may be expected to do good
work in the hurdles. A number of
good men are entered in the jumps.
Henley is back, the only one who
went over the bar for Stanford in
last year's Intercollegiate, and there
are a number of promising men in
these events. Lyons, who made a
sweater last year, will be out in the
broad jump. Hyde, who trains hard,
will do something with the shot,
and others will figure in this event
before the season is over. In the
hammer-throw Stanford cannot ex
pect to overcome Flaw's lead.
Brooke, who is not expected back
this semester, might have developed
under Moulton's coaching into a
"phenom." Lewis and Nichols will
commence work immediately.
To say the least, the team is at
present in a raw condition, and
work of the next few months must
be relied upon to make it what it
should be.
