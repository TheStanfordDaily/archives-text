At the beginning of the season
two facts must be recognized if we
expect to make a creditable show
ing against California on the track
this springâ€”a large number of can
didates are necessary from which
to choose the team, and men who
try for the events will be expected
to observe training requirements
from the time they begin work un
til the close of the season. Every
man of strength and activity who
turns out will not only contribute
his effort toward making a success
ful year, but he will gain ines
timable benefit for himself from the
systematic training, even if he fails
to make the team. And it is of es
pecial importance for new men to
come out. No one can learn his
possibilities without testing them.
A slender, unpromising young fel
low who was at Manzanita two
years ago, has been developed by
Moulton at Notre Dame into one
of the best quarter-mile runners of
the West. The man who works
hard and trains consistently will
win {joints in a field-day. With
one of the best trainers in the
country, we have the opportunity
of foundinga new era for track ath
letics at Stanford. It was immed
iately after the worst defeat she
ever suffered in football that Cali
fornia aroused herself and in the
following season of '98 first hum
bled Stanford on the gridiron, it
may be too much to expect a revolu
tion on the track in one year, but
we may profit by the parallel. Go
out and let "Dad" see what he can
do with you.
