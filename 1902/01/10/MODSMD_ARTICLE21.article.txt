# To Preserve Indian Languages.
## 
### 
The following appeared in the
San Francisco Bulletin Tuesday
evening from Berkeley.
" An effort is to be made at the
State University to preserve on
phonographic cylinders and on
written records the rapidly perish
ing native languages of the Califor
nia Indians. The university rec
ord contains an interesting account
of these endeavors to perpetuate
the sound and characteristics of the
language.
"As an illustration of the need
of haste in this work it is related
that Dr. Alfred L. Kroeber, in
structor in anthropology, has found
on the lower Trinity river two aged
men who are the only living be
ings who can speak Chimariko. Of
these one is too senile to give aid,
and the other too superstitious.
The language will probably die
with them.
" Four distinct Indian speech
communities yielded linguistic and
ethnological material to Dr. Kroe
ber's researches between September
16th and November 11th —the u
rok, on the lower Klamath, each of
whose settlements was visited, and
two of whose ceremonials were wit
nessed; the Wihosk, about Hum
boldt bay, whose language and
religion persist, but whose old man
ner of life is lost; the Karok, and
the Hupa, on the lower Trinity.
During this journey nearly three
hundred pieces were obtained for
the museum.
"The mythology, speech and life
of the Hupas, Wailakki, and other
Athabascan tribes are the subjects
of I'liny IS. Goddard's researches.
At the Battie rancheria, on October
7th, he saw a burial; at Bound

Valley lie wrote from an Indian's
dictation the text*, in Wailakki, of
twenty myths, and recorded on the
phonograph nineteen songs. Mr.
Goddard has recently worked out a
Konkau vocabulary, and has made
ethnological purchases, ethno-bo
tanical collections, and studies of
Indian and pioneer tradition."
