# DEBATERS CHOSEN.
## Jones, Wagner, and Rice, With Loof= bourow Alternate, Are the Carnot Team. 
### 
At the Carnot finals Friday
night Herbert C. Jones, '02,
Fletcher B. Wagner, '02, and Ed
ward W. Rice, '02, were chosen to
represent Stanford in the Carnot
debate this year, and L. L. Loof
bourow, '02, was given the alter
nate position. These four success
ful candidates out of the ten who
debated were selected by Professors
Green, Whittier, and Howard, who
acted as judges. Professor Burcham
presided, and J. J. Ryan, '03, was
time-keeper. The chapel was well
tilled at eight o'clock, when the de
bates began, though a number of
people came in late. Before intro
ducing the first speaker Professor
Burcham stated the Carnot subject,
which was the one argued by each
of the three squads: " Resolved,
That the President of the French
Republic should be chosen by direct
vote of the people."
L. L. Loofbourow, '02, opened
the first debate for the affirmative
by showing the dependency of the
French executive on the National
Assembly under the present system
of election. The substantial back
ing of a parliamentary government
is lacking in France, and the re
sponsibility of the President to the
people should be increased by mak
ing his election popular. The pro
posed scheme would effect a crystal
lization of political parties, and im
prove the character of the men
elected to the Chamber of Deputies.
F. B. Wagner, '02, replied for the
negative by supporting the present
form of election, and showing that
it resulted in the choice of efficient
men. The speaker praised the posi
tion of the French executive, and
maintained that by his insecurity
the security of his ofiiceis preserved.
Wagner's delivery and method of
presentation were agreeable and
effective, and bis style was finished.
J. W. Cameron, '03, continued
the debate for the affirmative. lie
held that the prevailing short term
of French ministry was due to the
lack of definite political parties, and
that this evil could be remedied by
a general election of the President.
There was need for a more thorough
education in politics,and for a more
harmonious division between the
legislative and executive branches
of government. These were needs
that could be supplied only by a
popular election of the President.
Loofbourow closed with a short,
able rebuttal,finishing with a forci
ble summary of the arguments ad
vanced in his first speech.
O. 11. Ritter, '04, in speaking on
the first affirmative of the second
squad, maintained that the French
method of election should be made
more democratic because the char
acter of the French voters was es
sentially wise, conservative, and
adapted to t he change.
I lie speech of E. H.Williams, '02,
for the negative, was one of the
most interesting and logical argu
ments of the evening, lie admitted
that a popular form of election was
desirable, and contended that the
question was merely one between
the choice of an executive by direct

and indirect popular vote. A direct
system should not be substituted
for the present one, because of the
indifference of the bulk of the
French people as to the character
of their President, and because of
the danger of a popular hero mak
ing himself a dictator.
E. W. Rice, '02, who followed
Williams with another speech on
the negative, reminded his audience
of W. A. Morris, the winner of the
Carnot medal last year, by his im
pressive delivery and thorough
command of his subject. For pure
argument Rice was, perhaps, super
ior to any of the other debaters. He
took a strong, impregnable posi
tion, and proceeded to repel the at
tacks of the affirmative. France
lacks experience in democratic
government. She is not ready for
the change, and is making no de
mand for it. She possesses the name
of a democracy, but the essence
of a monarchy. The proposed
method of election was tried in
1848, but has not been justified by
its results.
Hitter closed for the affirmative
with a three minutes' rebuttal.
Frank Roehr, '04, opened for the
third squad with the argument that
popular election was justified by
the change that had taken place in
the character of the French people.
They are the best judges of their
own affairs, and have proved them
selves worthy of electing their
President.
If it had been possible to take a
vote of the entire audience Friday
night, their unanimous choice
would have doubtless fallen on the
next speaker, H. C. Jones, '02. His
speech will long he remembered as
one of the best that iias been heard
by a Stanford audience in a debat
ing try-out. It combined solid,
logical argument with eloquent
persuasion, and held the attention
of the audience from start to finish.
Jones said that the change proposed
by the affirmative would expose
France to danger without helping
the position of her executive. That
it was inconsistent with the spirit
of the French government, and that
it would make a dictator of him.
C. DeW. Scott, '02, followed for
the affirmative in an able and care
fully prepared argument for . the
need of creating a strong public
opinion by giving the French peo
ple a chance to vote on the national
issues.
W. C. Maloy, '03, for the nega
tive, delivered the last speech of the
evening, with the exception of
Roehr's rebuttal. He upheld the
present system because it had
proved satisfactory, and had saved
France the turmoil and corruption
of popular elections.
The decision was read by Pro
fessor Burcham, after the judges
had adjourned for about half an
hour. In subsequent discussion of
the debates the judges expressed
themselves as well pleased with the
showing made. They considered
that the average of the speakers was
superior to that of any finals for an
intercollegiate debate ever before
held here. They expressed the
opinion that if our four men work
hard enough the chances are good
for Stanford again to be the winner
of the Carnot medal.

of election. The substantial back
ing of a parliamentary government
is lacking in France, and the re
sponsibility of the President to the
people should be increased by mak
ing his election popular. The pro
posed scheme would effect a crystal
lization of political parties, and im
prove the character of the men
elected to the Chamber of Deputies.
F. B. Wagner, '02, replied for the
negative by supporting the present
form of election, and showing that
it resulted in the choice of efficient
men. The speaker praised the posi
tion of the French executive, and
maintained that by his insecurity
the security of his ofiiceis preserved.
Wagner's delivery and method of
presentation were agreeable and
effective, and bis style was finished.
J. W. Cameron, '03, continued
the debate for the affirmative. lie
held that the prevailing short term
of French ministry was due to the
lack of definite political parties, and
that this evil could be remedied by
a general election of the President.
There was need for a more thorough
education in politics,and for a more
harmonious division between the
legislative and executive branches
of government. These were needs
that could be supplied only by a
popular election of the President.
Loofbourow closed with a short,
able rebuttal,finishing with a forci
ble summary of the arguments ad
vanced in his first speech.
O. 11. Ritter, '04, in speaking on
the first affirmative of the second
squad, maintained that the French
method of election should be made
more democratic because the char
acter of the French voters was es
sentially wise, conservative, and
adapted to t he change.
I lie speech of E. H.Williams, '02,
for the negative, was one of the
most interesting and logical argu
ments of the evening, lie admitted
that a popular form of election was
desirable, and contended that the
question was merely one between
the choice of an executive by direct

and indirect popular vote. A direct
system should not be substituted
for the present one, because of the
indifference of the bulk of the
French people as to the character
of their President, and because of
the danger of a popular hero mak
ing himself a dictator.
E. W. Rice, '02, who followed
Williams with another speech on
the negative, reminded his audience
of W. A. Morris, the winner of the
Carnot medal last year, by his im
pressive delivery and thorough
command of his subject. For pure
argument Rice was, perhaps, super
ior to any of the other debaters. He
took a strong, impregnable posi
tion, and proceeded to repel the at
tacks of the affirmative. France
lacks experience in democratic
government. She is not ready for
the change, and is making no de
mand for it. She possesses the name
of a democracy, but the essence
of a monarchy. The proposed
method of election was tried in
1848, but has not been justified by
its results.
Hitter closed for the affirmative
with a three minutes' rebuttal.
Frank Roehr, '04, opened for the
third squad with the argument that
popular election was justified by
the change that had taken place in
the character of the French people.
They are the best judges of their
own affairs, and have proved them
selves worthy of electing their
President.
If it had been possible to take a
vote of the entire audience Friday
night, their unanimous choice
would have doubtless fallen on the
next speaker, H. C. Jones, '02. His
speech will long he remembered as
one of the best that iias been heard
by a Stanford audience in a debat
ing try-out. It combined solid,
logical argument with eloquent
persuasion, and held the attention
of the audience from start to finish.
Jones said that the change proposed
by the affirmative would expose
France to danger without helping
the position of her executive. That
it was inconsistent with the spirit
of the French government, and that
it would make a dictator of him.
C. DeW. Scott, '02, followed for
the affirmative in an able and care
fully prepared argument for . the
need of creating a strong public
opinion by giving the French peo
ple a chance to vote on the national
issues.
W. C. Maloy, '03, for the nega
tive, delivered the last speech of the
evening, with the exception of
Roehr's rebuttal. He upheld the
present system because it had
proved satisfactory, and had saved
France the turmoil and corruption
of popular elections.
The decision was read by Pro
fessor Burcham, after the judges
had adjourned for about half an
hour. In subsequent discussion of
the debates the judges expressed
themselves as well pleased with the
showing made. They considered
that the average of the speakers was
superior to that of any finals for an
intercollegiate debate ever before
held here. They expressed the
opinion that if our four men work
hard enough the chances are good
for Stanford again to be the winner
of the Carnot medal.
At the Carnot finals Friday
night Herbert C. Jones, '02,
Fletcher B. Wagner, '02, and Ed
ward W. Rice, '02, were chosen to
represent Stanford in the Carnot
debate this year, and L. L. Loof
bourow, '02, was given the alter
nate position. These four success
ful candidates out of the ten who
debated were selected by Professors
Green, Whittier, and Howard, who
acted as judges. Professor Burcham
presided, and J. J. Ryan, '03, was
time-keeper. The chapel was well
tilled at eight o'clock, when the de
bates began, though a number of
people came in late. Before intro
ducing the first speaker Professor
Burcham stated the Carnot subject,
which was the one argued by each
of the three squads: " Resolved,
That the President of the French
Republic should be chosen by direct
vote of the people."
L. L. Loofbourow, '02, opened
the first debate for the affirmative
by showing the dependency of the
French executive on the National
Assembly under the present system
of election. The substantial back
ing of a parliamentary government
is lacking in France, and the re
sponsibility of the President to the
people should be increased by mak
ing his election popular. The pro
