At the head of this column to
day appears the staff of the Daily
Palo Alto as it will he for the
present. New members may he
added after they have served satis
factory trial, and changes will he
made from time to time in accord
ance with the character of the work
done and the degree of faithful
ness shown hy those who are giving
a large part of their time to make
the publication of the paper possi
ble. Every one now on the staff
has earned and held his place hy
persistent, conscientious effort; any
one added will have secured his
place in the same way. There are
no honorary positions, and readers
may know that the members are
devoting many of their best hours
to this work. Without compensa
tion, without University credit, and
without due recognition for the
service they do the community,
they gather the news of interest,
present announcements, and give
the students and faculty a daily re
view of our University life and a
bulletin of approaching events.
It may fairly be said that the
Daily Palo Alto has always cov
ered its field as well as any other
college daily in the country, and
better than many of them. This is
due to the energy of the staff.
Some of the dailies from the larger
Eastern institutions resemble a bul
letin board, and have about as
much life in them. On this, paper
one gets a more general experience
and, in many respects, a better
drill in newspaper work. Although
gained with no more display of abil
ity and belli with no more exercise
of effort than must be shown here, :
positions on the Eastern publica

tions are looked upon as places of
distinction.
Look over the names of this staff.
If you have an acquaintance on it,
assist him all you can in gathering
the news of the campus. It is
through his efforts that you keep
in touch with college affairs; it is
because lie spends time which
many of you give to recreation that
you know when concerts, entertain
ments, class meetings, games, etc.,
are to take place —spends thiß time
without receiving the encourage
ment of his friends, without the ap
plause given the football man and
the debater, and often without even
a complimentary to the affair
which his advertising has made
possible. For defects in the paper,
the editor is responsible, and it is
his chief function to receive the
criticism that is always given so
generously, but whenever you can,
show your appreciation to members
of the staff for the work they are
doing.
