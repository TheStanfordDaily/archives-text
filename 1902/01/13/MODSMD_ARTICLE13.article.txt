### 
The bed for the new campus rail
road track is being layed. It
branches from the main line just
where the present one does, enter
ing the estate near the old running
track and passing through the field
between the oval and Alvarado
Ilow, thence across the row and
back of Dr. Stillman's house and
the Training-house. From there
it continues in the rear of the
power-house and Engineering build
ings and for a quarter of a mile
into the field beyond the Bookstore
and Drugstore.
