### 
A four-inch layer of crushed
granite is being placed over the ce
ment for a width of about twenty
five feet at the east end of the
quadrangle. When rolled, this
flooring will be similar to the plat
form at the Palo Alto station, and
if it proves satisfactory the entire
quadrangle will be thus covered.
