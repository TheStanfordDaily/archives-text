# Successful Rehearsal.
## 
### 
The first rehearsal of the newly
formed Festival Choir occurred on
Friday evening in the chapel, and
from every point of view it wtos
most successful. About fifty singers
took part, and three of the greater
choruses from Haydn's "Creation"
were gone through. The next meet
ing is called for 4:30 next Friday,
and Mr. Scott-Brook urges all those
who intend joining the organiza
tion to be in attendance upon that
occasion.
