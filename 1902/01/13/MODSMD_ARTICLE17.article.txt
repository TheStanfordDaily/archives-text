# The 						Addresses by Professor Lloyd.

### 
Rev. R. R. Lloyd, of the Pacific
Theological Seminary, Oakland,
preached in the chapel yesterday
morning on the subject "Jesus the
Servant of Man." The minister
dwelt upon the conditions of society
in Christ's time when the world
was divided into two classes be
tween whom hostility was engen
dered â€”those who served and those
who were served. Jesus, however,
ignored these distinctions and en
deavored to reach all men. He did
not discriminate between races, be
tween the servant and the served,
the poor and the rich, the humble
and the powerful. He himself be
came the servant of men. When
he told his disciples to be as wise
as serpents and as harmless as
doves, he taught them to follow the
example of his own life. By over
looking the artificial barriers of
class, he first developed the idea of
universal brotherhood, and impres
sed the truth that one comes nearer
to Cod as becomes near to man.
In the evening Professor Lloyd
gave an interesting and profitable
address before the Christian As
sociations on the methods of bible
study. He emphasized as impor
tant the study of each book in the
bible as a whole, reading the entire
story at first, and then of taking it
up in paragraphs. Among other
things, be suggested inserting fly
leaves on which to write comments,
between the printed pages, and be
urged every one to get the best
edition of the scriptures available.
Pofessor Lloyd had a happy and
unique way of illustrating his
ideas.
