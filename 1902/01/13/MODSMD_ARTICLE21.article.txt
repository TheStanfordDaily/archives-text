## "Hotel Green Topics" Compliments Our Football Men On Their Behavior. 
### 
The Hotel Green Topics of Jan
uary 4th, published by the Hotel
Green of Pasadena, where the Stan
ford football men were domiciled
during their presence in that city,
makes many favorable comments
about the men and their conduct
while at the hotel. One article says:
"The Stanford football boys, by
their gentlemanly behavior while
at the hotel, won the admiration of
all, and despite the fact that their
defeat by the Michigan team was
accepted from the first as an al
most foregone conclusion, the Stan
ford team had a solid phalanx of
staunch supporters in the girls at
the Green, who wore the colors and
rallied around them. In the floral
pageant, the coach bearing the
young ladies from the hotel was
preceded by a coach filled with
Stanford boys, and many flattering
rounds were kept up between them
as they passed along the line of
march, which were enjoyed by the
spectators. The college cries and
returns embodied in many forms of
doggerel the idea that there were
no girls like the Green girls, and
that the Stanford men were the
whole thing."
From another article the follow
ing is taken:
"The presence of the Stanford
and Michigan University football
teams gave a zest to the festivities
this year, and with the blue and
gold was worn the red of Stanford,
the blue and yellow of the Michi
gan boys. The Green to a man
stood loyal to the California uni
versity, and to the fine, gentle
manly young men who have won
by their manliness and dignified
carriage golden opinions from all
with whom they have come in con
tact during their ten days' stay at
the hotel."
Another example of the loyalty
of the hotel guests to Stanford is
shown here:
"Twenty-four guests of the hotel
formed a party attending the Stan
ford glee club concert New Year's
night, and indicated their preju
dices in favor of the California boys
by applauding loudly at every refer
ence to Stanford."
Under "Social Life" is the fol
lowing account of the appearance
of the injured men at the Glee Club
concert in the evening:
"The Stanford Glee Club con
cert at the opera house New
Year's night was not only a highly
creditable performance, but the
audience was composed almost en
tirely of the smart set in evening
dress. The Michigan football
team occupied two of the pros
cenium boxes on the right, the
Stanford team on the left. The
defeated, crippled and bandaged
heroes appeared upon the scene,
and were greeted with even more
enthusiasm than the victors,for the
California university men won
laurels here for more substantial
qualities of nmnliness than are ex
hibited in football, and will not
soon be forgotten. That they were
entirely outclassed in the game
cannot be denied. Moreover, tbey
were handicapped by accidents to
their best men, but that they made
a brave fight and put up a credit
able game is generally admitted.
After the Glee Club concert, which
was appreciated by the hundreds
present, the men of both colleges

were guests at a large reception
and dance at the Valley Hunt Club
house, where the festivities were
kept up until nearly daybreak.
Most of the men left Pasadena
Thursday."
