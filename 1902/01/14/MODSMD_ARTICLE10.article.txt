# Could Not Do Fast Work.
## 
### 
Seventeen men showed up for
baseball practice yesterday after
noon. The cold weather has made
fast work almost an impossibility,
and little fielding was done. Coach
Swindells gave instructions in
handling the bat. Knight showed
up well, as did McGilvray, who
promises to be a heavy hitter.
