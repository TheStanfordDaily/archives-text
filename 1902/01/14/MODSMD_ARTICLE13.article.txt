# The 						Comic Opera.
## 
### 
The presentation of Gilbert and
Sullivan's comic opera, the "Pirates
of Penzance," on Friday evening,
February 141,11, in the Assembly
Hall, promises to he a musical
treat, and an important event of
the semester. Everything is being
done to make it a complete perform
ance, and judging from the work
which both principals and chorus

have done since rehearsals com
menced on November 21st, it will
undoubtedly be successful.
Arrangements have been made
with the Tivoli Opera House, in
San Francisco, for the use of their
scenery, which will add much to
the effect. Goldstein, Gohn and
Co. will supply the costumes.
The score calls for ten principals,
with a chorus of forty eight, and an
orchestra of sixteen pieces. All the
choruses and orchestration will be
given in a well balanced manner.
Rehearsals prior to February Ist
will be held in Nortree Hall, Palo
Alto, but after that time the Assem
bly Hall will be used.
