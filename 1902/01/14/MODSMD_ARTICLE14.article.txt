# Proposed Fencing Club.
## 
### 
There is some talk of forming a
Fencing Club at the University.
At least a dozen men here have had
more or less experience in that art,
and if they were to organize them
selves into a club they could bene
fit each other greatly. Most of the
larger Eastern universities have
fencing clubs and hold annual con
tests at Cornell, Yale, Harvard,
Michigan, Wisconsin, and other
institutions. Fencing is often con
sidered a gentle, light exercise;
but it is by no means such,
for it employs the whole body, and
if practiced properly should de
velop the left arm as much as
the right. It makes a man quick
and graceful and trains the eye.
As in all athletic sports, one must
practice it systematically to keep
in form. Those advocating a fenc
ing club here say that it would
bring together men of different
fencing schools, would develop those
who have had little experience, and
would keep those of considerable
experience in good practice and
trim. A meeting of students inter
ested in the sport will be called
shortly to discuss the subject of or
ganization.
