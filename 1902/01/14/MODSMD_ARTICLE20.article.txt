No one who has not worked seri
ously in preparing a debate can
appreciate the mental effort it
means to those taking part in pre
liminaries, finals, and intercollegi
ate contests. The men who were
chosen Friday night to represent
Stanford in the Carnot have, to
gether with the honor they gain, a
most arduous duty imposed on
them. During the few weeks re
maining, they must apply them
selves to study and preparation un
equaled by any course in the Uni
versity for the amount of time and
severity of application required.
And yet, nothing else so develops
the mind for the effective study of
economic, social, and political sub
jects as this very work. The man
who organizes historical facts and
economic data, who draws there
from an argument or line of
thought, who makes the informa
tion which he absorbs in the lecture

room and library serve some defi
nite purpose and illustrate some
lesson, —this man is using what he
has acquired. He employs it in a
positive purpose; he learns to
think aggressively. Exercise in
debate is just as much an applica
tion of what one learns in certain
branches of study as the labora
tory experiment is an application
of principles given. Preparation
of a thesis and of assigned papers
may in a measure give such exer
cise, bit these do not demand the
intellectual energy, the alertness,
and acuteness.
Every one recognizes that the de
bate of the college man is not the
mature and powerful product pre
sented by public orators, lawyers,
statesmen, and men of a lifetime of
active experience. For this reason
the athlete attracts wider attention,
and justly so, for the successful
college football player or truck man
has reached the acme of his field;
he can never again gain such dis
tinction in this line, and he may
never again secure such prominence
before the public. "The glory of
young men is tlieir strength, and
the beauty of old men is the grey
head." The debater, however, is
giving himself an exercise which
does more to educate his mind, to
make him effeclive for certain call
ings and for many of the activities
expected from a college graduate,
than do a large part of the courses
in the curriculum. Even the foot
ball and track man get gymnasium
credit for their work; the Greek
student gets credit for taking part
in a drama; and the Glee Club
man gets a trip; but the debater,
unless he makes a team, secures no
recognition whatever. At many
colleges credit toward graduation
is given for such work, and the
number is constantly increasing.
There may l>e some reason why a
similar provision cannot be made
by the Economics or History or
English department at Stanford.
The subject has often been agitated,
but whatever this reason may be
it is so far unfathomable by the or
dinary undergraduate.
