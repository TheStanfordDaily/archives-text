"Stanford will he richest of all
the American universities. The
management of its properties and
the improvement of its opportunities
are going to he a work of vast im
portance and heavy responsibility.
One wonders about its future;
whether its field is big enough both
for it and the other great Califor
nia university near by; whether it
will really earn its own living and
prove itself important enough as a
civilizing force to justify its enor
mous endowment. There is no uni
versity in the world whose problems
seem more remarkable and its fu
ture better worth watching. Being
only ten years old, Stanford has as
yet only a small body of alumni
(1200J, and of course lacks the ele
ment. of strength which the old
universities find in their older grad
uates. But Stanford will have
graduates enough in time and prob
ably they will have due voice in
her management."
