# Elective System at Pennsylvania.
## 
### 
The University of Pennsylvania
has just adopted the elective system
in a number of its courses. This
system has always prevailed at
Stanford, but the Eastern universi
ties have been slow in taking it up.

"()iieof the most important pages
in the new University Catalogue is
the pink slip which provides for the
new elective system. The idea is not
new. but its adoption at Pennsyl
vania makes an appreciable change
in the requirements for a collegiate
degree. Indiana University has suc

cessfully followed a similar method
since 1886, and many of the West
ern State universities use the plan.
"In each of the courses in Arts and
Science, Finance and Economy, and
Biology, sixty units of work (a unit
being one hour a week of attendance
at lecture or recitation, or two hours
a week of laboratory work for one
year) complete within either three,
four or five years, will entitle to a
degree. The required work is re
duced and the number of free elec
tives increased.
"In this way the student may
complete the course in three, four
or five years, according to natural
ability, health, strength and time
available for study. Graduation
becomes merely incidental to the
doing of the work, instead of the
work being incidental to the com
pletion of the course. It discour
ages loafing and working merely to
get through."
