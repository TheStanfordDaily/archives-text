# Removal of the Ivy.

### 
The ivy vines at the side arches
and the corners of the quad are all
being removed at the orders of
Mrs. Stanford. The vines, which
have acquired an excellent growth,
tend to relieve the bareness of the
stone buildings, and their removal
will take away much of the beauty
of the quad. The reason assigned
for their removal is that they dis
color the buildings and injure
the tiles. The dirt left on the
stones will doubtless have to be
chiseled off.
