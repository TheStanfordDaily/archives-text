# Will Not Sell lunch Tickets
## 
### 
The board of directors of the Inn
has decided not to sell any more
lunch tickets at the rate of five
meals for a dollar, as was stated in
the Daily Palo Alto last evening.
It has been found that the number
of meals served at noon is already
as great as the present facilities will
allow, and a rate of twenty-five
cents will he charged to all but reg
ular members. Difficulty is being
experienced in securing more stu
dent waiters.
