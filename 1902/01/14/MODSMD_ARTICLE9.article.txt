# TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
## Captain McCaughern Requests Men To Report for Track Work at 4 O'clock. 
### 
Tomorrow (Wednesday) after
noon all the men in the University
who can or who desire to do some
thing for their University on the
track are expected to report on the
oval at 4 p.m. We want every
man to come out and try. The ad
vantages are manifold. Even if
the candidate does not succeed in
making the team, the physical
training and general track work
will be of inestimable value.
Every man who comes out will re
ceive attention. The track work
will be conducted on a new basis,
and in every department there will
be renovation.
During the season there will be
several meets, one at least to be
held away from the campus. In
the middle of February a relay race
will take place between teams from
the fraternities, eating clubs, and
the hall. These teams will be com
posed of four men, and the distance
will be from 250 to 800 yards.
Let every man come out and do
his duty for his college. He may
be assured of receiving fair, honest
treatment.
J. C. McCaughkki^;
Track Captain.
