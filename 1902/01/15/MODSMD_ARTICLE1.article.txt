# HINMAN ELECTED.
## Chosen President of the Senior Class Today.—An Interesting Contest. 
### 
Frank Hinman was chosen pres
ident of the Class of 1902 at the J
election today. The polls were open
on the quadrangle from 11 o'clock
until 2, and when the votes were
counted it was found that 169 had
been cast —the largest number in

Hinman had received 114 to 55 for

the vote would be much closer, for

an intense interest was taken in the
contest.
