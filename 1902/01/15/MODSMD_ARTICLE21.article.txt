Here is what the Michigan Daily
Newu of January Bth has to say of
the New Year's game:
"The greatest event of the Michi
gan vacation period was the foot
hall game at Pasadena January Ist,
when Michigan defeated Stanford
University hy the decisive score of
49-0. This score is said to he quite
in proportion to the general superi
ority of Michigan over the great
team of the Far West, hut it does not
tell the story of Stanford's desper
ate hut futile effort against defeat.
The Associated Press dispatches
were general in character, so the
Michigan Daily News will only give
a detailed account of the game.
"To Stanford's honor let it be
said, however, that her team played
a plucky, ciean game of orthodox
football, and Michigan's superior
physical condition and knowledge
of the game were the factors which
worked the wonder."
