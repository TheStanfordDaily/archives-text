# Snow on All-American Team.
## 
### 
Caspar Whitney has selected
Snow of the Michigan team as one of
the ends of the all-American team.
The Michigan Daily News com
ments thus on this selection:
'Tt will he noticed that Neil
Snow is the only Western player
given a place on the team. Two
Wisconsin men, however, —Larson,
halfback, and Curtis, tackle, —are
selected as substitutes. The es
teem in which Snow's work is held
may he gathered from the fact that
the men he freezes out and sends
to the substitute list are Captain
Campbell, of Harvard, and Davis,
of Princeton, the first named a vet
eran of renown, and the other man
a player of whom Charles E. Pat
terson, admittedly a fair-minded
and competent writer, said: 'J re
gard him as the best all-round end
of the season.'"
