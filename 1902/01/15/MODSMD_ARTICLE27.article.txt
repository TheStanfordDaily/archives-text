VERY GOOD ENTERTAINMENT.
A fair house heard the Stanford
Glee and Mandolin Clubs concert
las tevening at the Armory. The
boys gave a very good entertain
ment too, particularly pleasing be
ing Maker and Bush, the comed
ians, Oldshausen, the flutist, and
Byrne, the reader. It was an even
ing of mirth and melody, generous
ly permeated by college spirit. — The
Daily Progress, Pomona.
AT REDLANDS.
At the Academy of Music last
evening the Stanford G lee and Man
dolin Clubs entertained a large au
dience. Many of the numbers called
forth encores, which were responded
to willingly. The entertainment is
a pleasing one, and of interest to all
who are watching the work of those
availing themselves of the oppor
tunity to attend Stanford Univer
sity. —Rc.dla.nds Daily Facts.
MODESTO PLEASED.
A large audience greeted the ap
pearance of the Stanford Glee and
Mandolin Clubs at the Opera House
last evening. There were twenty
eight of the young men in the two
clubs, and the mandolin pla3'ing
and glee songs were highly pleasing
to all present, and every number
was given a hearty encore, which
was responded to. The comic reci
tations of Byrnes were exceptiona
bly good and amusing, and he was
vociferously applauded, and he re
sponded twice to each recitation.
The comical antics of Corbusier
were also liberally applauded. 01s
hausen as a flutist was remarka
bly good. The imitation of grand
opera by Messrs. Baker and Bush
brought down the house. The en
tertainment was a good one through
out. —Modesta News.
ENCORED AT SAN BERNARDINO.
The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs appeared at the Opera House
last evening and gave a very credit
able performance. With the club
is Leo 1). Byrne, of this city, who
appears as a monologuist, and con
siderable interest was taken in his
appearance. His recitations and
impersonations were clever, and he
was compelled to respond to several
encores. The music of the Mando
lin Club was up to the standard,
but Stanford has sent glee clubs
this way that sang far better than
the one than appeared last night.
The audience was enthusiastic and
encored everything. —San Bernard
ino Daily Sun.
GOOD PROGRAM AT MAPKKA.
The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs gave a performance here last
Saturday night. There was a fair
sized audience, which was well re
paid for the attendance, for the pro
gram was a good one and the
players rendered some sweet music.
The pieces by the Mandolin Club
were well executed and were very
enjoyable. The Glee Club sang
several good songs, but the tenor

parts were weak. Mr. Corbusier
furnished considerable fun, and his
singing and dancing were thorough
ly enjoyed. Mr. Bvrne gave some
funny recitations which created a
great deal of amusement, and which
showed the young gentleman to be
a very clever actor. Burlesque
grand opera, by Messrs. Baker and
Bush, brought down the house, and
called for many encores. A flute
solo by Mr. Olshausen was well
.rendered. In fact the entire enter
tainment was enjoyable. — Daily
Madera Mercury.
LARGE AUDIENCE AT RIVERSIDE.
It was a large and sympathetic
audience which greeted the Stanford
Glee and Mandolin Clubs on Satur
day night. The house was crowded
from pit to foyer, and the college
spirit was as strong as if the enter
tainment had been in the seat of
a university. The performance
compared well with like concerts,
and some of the specialties were ex
ceptional for their originality and
merit. The work of the Mandolin
Club had much to commend it, and
the character of the selections was
as satisfactory as the manner in
which they were presented. Mr.
Olshausen's flute solo was the best
bit of work ever heard upon that
instrument here. The Glee Club
.was especially strong in ensemble,
and the solo numbers received a
due mead of appreciation. The
specialties introduced by Baker and
Bush were deliciously funny, and
put a fitting climax to the enter
tainment. The Berkeley and Indian
fowtball teams occupied boxes on
either side of the stage, and the dis
play of their colors lent effective
ness to the opera house decorations.

called for many encores. A flute
solo by Mr. Olshausen was well
.rendered. In fact the entire enter
tainment was enjoyable. — Daily

LARGE AUDIENCE AT RIVERSIDE.
It was a large and sympathetic
audience which greeted the Stanford
Glee and Mandolin Clubs on Satur
day night. The house was crowded
from pit to foyer, and the college
spirit was as strong as if the enter
tainment had been in the seat of
a university. The performance
compared well with like concerts,
and some of the specialties were ex
ceptional for their originality and
merit. The work of the Mandolin
Club had much to commend it, and
the character of the selections was
as satisfactory as the manner in
which they were presented. Mr.
Olshausen's flute solo was the best
bit of work ever heard upon that
instrument here. The Glee Club
.was especially strong in ensemble,
and the solo numbers received a
due mead of appreciation. The
specialties introduced by Baker and
Bush were deliciously funny, and
put a fitting climax to the enter
tainment. The Berkeley and Indian
fowtball teams occupied boxes on
either side of the stage, and the dis
play of their colors lent effective
ness to the opera house decorations.

Below are given extracts from the
press reports of the Glee and Man

the impression they made. Only a
part of the notices appear today,
and the others will he in succeed
ing issues:
VERY GOOD ENTERTAINMENT.
A fair house heard the Stanford
Glee and Mandolin Clubs concert
las tevening at the Armory. The
boys gave a very good entertain
ment too, particularly pleasing be
ing Maker and Bush, the comed
ians, Oldshausen, the flutist, and
Byrne, the reader. It was an even
ing of mirth and melody, generous
ly permeated by college spirit. — The
Daily Progress, Pomona.
AT REDLANDS.
At the Academy of Music last
evening the Stanford G lee and Man
dolin Clubs entertained a large au
dience. Many of the numbers called
forth encores, which were responded
to willingly. The entertainment is
a pleasing one, and of interest to all
who are watching the work of those
availing themselves of the oppor
tunity to attend Stanford Univer
sity. —Rc.dla.nds Daily Facts.
MODESTO PLEASED.
A large audience greeted the ap
pearance of the Stanford Glee and
Mandolin Clubs at the Opera House
last evening. There were twenty
eight of the young men in the two
clubs, and the mandolin pla3'ing
and glee songs were highly pleasing
to all present, and every number
was given a hearty encore, which
was responded to. The comic reci
tations of Byrnes were exceptiona
bly good and amusing, and he was
vociferously applauded, and he re
sponded twice to each recitation.
The comical antics of Corbusier
were also liberally applauded. 01s
hausen as a flutist was remarka
bly good. The imitation of grand
opera by Messrs. Baker and Bush
brought down the house. The en
tertainment was a good one through
out. —Modesta News.
ENCORED AT SAN BERNARDINO.
The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs appeared at the Opera House
last evening and gave a very credit
able performance. With the club
is Leo 1). Byrne, of this city, who
appears as a monologuist, and con
siderable interest was taken in his
appearance. His recitations and
impersonations were clever, and he
was compelled to respond to several
encores. The music of the Mando
lin Club was up to the standard,
but Stanford has sent glee clubs
this way that sang far better than
the one than appeared last night.
The audience was enthusiastic and
encored everything. —San Bernard
ino Daily Sun.
GOOD PROGRAM AT MAPKKA.
The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs gave a performance here last
Saturday night. There was a fair
sized audience, which was well re
paid for the attendance, for the pro
gram was a good one and the
players rendered some sweet music.
The pieces by the Mandolin Club
were well executed and were very
enjoyable. The Glee Club sang
several good songs, but the tenor

parts were weak. Mr. Corbusier
furnished considerable fun, and his
singing and dancing were thorough
ly enjoyed. Mr. Bvrne gave some
funny recitations which created a
great deal of amusement, and which
showed the young gentleman to be
a very clever actor. Burlesque
grand opera, by Messrs. Baker and
Bush, brought down the house, and
called for many encores. A flute
solo by Mr. Olshausen was well
.rendered. In fact the entire enter
tainment was enjoyable. — Daily
