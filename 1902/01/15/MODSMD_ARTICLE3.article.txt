# The 						Concert Friday Night.
## 
### 
Tickets will be placed on sale on
the quadrangle tomorrow for the
concert of the Musical Clubs Fri
day night. Later they will be sold
at the University Bookstore and
in Palo Alto. Doubtless a large
crowd will attend the entertain
ment, as this is the first opportun
ity to hear the clubs in anything
like a complete program on the
campus this year. From the press
comments published in this issue,
it will be seen that they were well
received on the recent tour. An
especially attractive feature which
took well everywhere is the imita
tion of grand opera by Baker and
Bush.
