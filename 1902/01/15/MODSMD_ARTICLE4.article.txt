An enjoyable meeting of the
English Club was held last even
ing at the Kappa Kappa Gamma
house. The spirit of the gather
ing was purely informal, and so
cially it was one of the most
successful that the club has yet
had. The feature of the evening
was a paper by Mrs. Margaret
Collier Graham on "The Virtue of
Staying at Home," which assailed,
in a deliciously satirical way, the
alleged pleasures of traveling.
Miss Kimball rendered a banjo
solo, which was heartily encored.
The rest of the evening was de
voted to an informal "jolly-up."
About thirty were present.
