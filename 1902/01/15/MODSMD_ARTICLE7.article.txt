# MORE FIELD-DAYS.
## Track Management Is Planning for Frequent Meetings on the Oval This Semester. 
### 
During the present semester it is
the intention of the track captain
and coach to pull off as many
field-days as possible. Hitherto
our teams have as a rule gone
against Berkeley without meeting
any other team in competition,
it will lie a hard matter to arrange
for meets with competent teams,
but everything possible will be
done by the management. Field
days between Nevada, Ukiah High,
Oakland High, Santa Clara Col
lege, and our Varsity and Fresh
man teams may be expected. The
regular interclass tield-day will be
held the last of March as usual,
and as many meets as it is possible
to arrange will be held on the
campus. The interdepartment field
day, which has come to be almost
an annual affair, will probably
take place early in the season.
Handicap meets will also be held
oftener than usual.
A great deal of interest has been
aroused over the proposed relay
race which McCaughern has
planned as a feature of one of the
campus field-days, it will come
in between other events, and con
siderable competition is expected.
In looking over the possibilities for
such an event, it was thought best
to shorten the distance from the
quarter-mile, as generally run on
the Coast, to 220 or 300 yards,
since a large number of men are
out for the short sprints, and it is
recognized that such sprinting will
be as beneficial to distance men as
to sprinters. Four men will com
pose each team. Several of the
fraternities, the several eating
clubs, Encina Hall, Palo Alto, the
training-house, and possibly some
of the publications will enter teams
for this event. The relay race
should be entered into seriously at
once, and if each organization will
take a proper amount of interest in
the production of a good set of
men, inestimable benefit will accrue
in the added interest sure to be
taken in track athletics.
