# No Washington Track Meet.
## 
### 
Manager Edwards is in receipt
of a letter from Charles E. Case,lies,
manager of the University of Wash
ington track team, who was here
dnring the vacation when Edwards
was absent with the musical cluhs.
tiasehes is still attempting to ar
range matters so that he can bring
the Washington team down some
time during the present semester.

He asks for a $600 guarantee,which
he proposes may lie divided be
tween Stanford and Berkeley, pro
vided lie can arrange a tneet with
both universities. Manager Ed
wards considers the proposition out
of the question; and negotiations
will go no further. The Intercol
legiate track meet will he held on
this campus and of course will be
well attended, but, judging from
past experience, the management
does not feel justified in assuming
a $300 guarantee. Field-days
have not, as a rule, been well at
tended here, as was shown last year
and in the meet with the Univer
sity of Nevada two years ago, when
not more than a few dozen spec
tators gathered to witness the per
formances.
