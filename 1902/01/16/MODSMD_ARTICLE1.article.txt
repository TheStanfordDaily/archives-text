# ON THE CINDER-PATH.
## Training Commences for Track Team Candidates with Light Work and a Fair Amount of Material. 
### 
"Dad" Moulton and McCaughern
express themselves as well pleased
witli the turn-out of men on the
track yesterday afternoon, though
the number was not as large as it
should have been. About forty
live, including several men who
were not out last semester, appeared
and were put through some light
jogging by the trainer. It is Moul
ton's intention to devote the re
mainder of this week and probably
the fore part of next to light run
ning, preparing the men for an
increase of work, and starting from
the mark. All the track men will
be trained in sprinting as will
most of those entered in the field
events. Sufficient precaution will
be taken against break-downs, the
harder work and especially the
sprinting being reserved for warm
days in preference to those days
when the air is chilly and the
muscles less ready for action. The
preliminary light work is also a
precaution aimed to strengthen the
limbs so that there can be 110 ac
cidents in the more strenuous ef
forts in starting and sprinting.
Several candidates who were not
out yesterday will commence train
ing today or tomorrow. Any one
who expects to do track work
should get out immediately. "Dad"
intends to make a team and to de
velop individual performers. He
could do the latter by working up
on the men at any time of the day,
but to work a team he must have
all the men out at once. It is im
portant that every one get out at
the hour named.
