# INITIATES PERFORMED
## Phi Delta Phi Candidates Amused Themselves and Others On the Campus. 
### 
As a prelude to their regular
initiation, which occurs tonight in
San Jose, twelve novitiates of the
Phi Delta Phi law fraternity were
put through laughable ji 11 kn thin
morning on the campus. They
climbed poles, and performed with
abandon for the amusement of
those fortunate enough to see them.
But it was not of their choice â€”they
did what they were told to do.
The jinks occurred in front of
the post-office shortly before noon.
The neophytes were arrayed in
ridiculous costumes, purported to
be Korean and Japanese, and were
accompanied by a string band of
about two strings. Alleged songs
were sung to the accompaniment of
a horn, bass viol, and a guitar.
Poles were climbed, foot-races run,
and stunts of varied and assorted
lots were given. At 12:30 the
victims were dismissed to different
sororities, where they waited on the
table, juggled the crockery, and
amused the girls. It was a very
pleasant morning for them.
Those who went through it, and
who have more still to go through
tonight, are J. W. Cameron, C. H.
Crawford, E. Fogg, VV. Morrison,
T. E. Palmer, L. F. Clinton, E. A.
Jones, G. H. Lutgerding, Roy
Keith, E. I. Thayer, H. H. Atkin
son, and Roy Leib. All are mem
bers of the Junior class.
