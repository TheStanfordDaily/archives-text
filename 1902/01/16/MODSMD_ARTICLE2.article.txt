# Short and Fast Practice.
## 
### 
Last night's baseball practice
was short, sharp, and encouraging.
Twenty-one men were out, and, de
spite the anti-baseball chill in the
air, they worked well. From the
moment Coach Swindells appealed
until the practice was over they
were hard at work with a view to
developing weak spots. In the
short game that is being made a
feature of the nightly practice
some good plays and some that
were ragged were made. Tritch
and Blake were the battery for the
Varsity, while McFarland and Gli
der officiated at the sending and
receiving ends for the second.
