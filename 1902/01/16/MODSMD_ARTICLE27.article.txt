# Glee Clubs' Philanthropy.

### 
At Fresno, the members of the
(ilee Club exercised a little practi
cal philanthropy, which occasioned
the following article in the livening
Democrat of that place:
"The Stanford Glee Club stopped
over on Sunday en route to the
southern end of the State and the
hoys amused themselves in rather
a unique manner. In the forenoon
two of them, acc< mpanied by one
of the young men of Fresno, pre
sented themselves at the county
jiiil and asked permission of Dep
uty Sheriff Payne, who was in
charge for the day, to look through
the institution. Payne took them
through the building and they re
marked that their comrades would
enjoy a similar tour of inspection
if it could be granted them. Payne
told them to take the boys up, so
in the afternoon the club went
through the jail.
"They conversed with the prison
ers, and after completing their in
spection lined up in the reception
room and sang several songs, to the
delight of all the inmates. Shortly
after taking their departure two of
them returned, their arms tilled with
books and good reading matter,
and asked whether they might be
allowed to distribute them among
the prisoners.
"Payne is enthusiastic over the
conduct of the boys. He says they
were us gentlemanly as any one
could be, and did not indulge in
any of the cheap witticisms which
young men are usually so fond of,
to display their superior mental
attainments. He thinks some of
the good people of Fresno might
profit by the example the boys
set in purchasing books to enliven
the holidays for the prisoners."
