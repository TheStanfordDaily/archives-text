# Coronado Was Discourteous.
## 
### 
The Musical Clubs, among other
experiences of their recent trip,
had a disagreement with the man
agement of the Coronado hotel that
does notspeak well for the treatment
accorded them as guests. Naturally
the .fellows didn't stay there long.
They didn't even wait for the hall.
They have also given their last
concert at Coronado. The trouble
began over a misunderstanding as
to the admission price of the con
cert, the hotel management disre
garding all arrangements which
their agent had made with the
club, and intimating to the hoys
that they didn't care to have them
around anyway. The hotel bill
was presented before it was due,
and other discourtesies were shown
Stanford's representatives. As
Manager Edwards s;iid in an inter
view in the San Diego Sun: "We
have put up at the best hotels all
up the coast and never before have
been accorded such treatment.
We will never return to Coronado
again."
