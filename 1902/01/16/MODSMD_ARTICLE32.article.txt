Here are some more of the com
ments made by newspapers in the
towns and cities visited by the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs:
JOLLY BONGS APPRECIATED.
The appearance of the Stanford
Glee and Mandolin Clubs at the
Grand last night was greeted with
a good audience who appreciated
to the full the jolly songs and
specialties of the college boys. The
chorus work of the club shows the
effect of hard training, which has
brought about that grade of en
semble singing so diflicult to ob
tain. The specialties and the solo
ists of the evening were well re
ceived by the audience and elicited
hearty applause. The playing of
the Mandolin and Guitar Clubs
was in the first rank of work of
that character. —Santa, Ana Herald.
RECEIVED UNSTINTED APPLAUSE.
A large and sympathetic audience
was well entertained at the Opera
House last evening by the Stanford
Glee and Mandolin Clubs. It was
an evening of good, rollicking col
lege music, interspersed with pleas
ing specialties, which received un
stinted applause. The voices of the
Glee Club were well balanced, and
their singing of college songs was
replete with the spirit and dash
that makes the college glee club
popular throughout the land. The
mandolin and guitar players were
very good. The Stanford song,
"One, two, three, four," by the com
bined clubs, was one of the most
pleasing numbers on the program.
Mr. Bryne had two specialties that
were very well received. While his
subjects were not particularly fun
ny, yet the audience was kept in a
continual state of merriment by the
way Mr. Bryne presented them.
Too much cannot be said in praise
of Mr. Corbusier's turn, especially
his whistling solo accompanied on
the guitar by himself. His imita
tion of the mocking bird was ex
cellent. Messrs. Bush and Baker
won the hearts of the audience by
their clever comic specialty, which
combined music, singing and danc
ing.—Santa Barbara Morning Press.
