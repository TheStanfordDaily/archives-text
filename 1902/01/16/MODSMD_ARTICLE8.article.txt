# FOR NEXT YEAR.
## Captain Traeger Has Planned a System of Coaching Similar to Cornell's. 
### 
The following description of the
graduate foothill 1 coach system at
Cornell, as given by Coach Reed, is
published at the request of Captain
Traeger, who has made plans for
next season with which this ac
cords. Mr. Reed says:
"It may be of interest to the
alumni to know something of the
graduate system of coaching. Inas
much as the success of the new sys
tem depends very largely, if not en
tirely, upon the support received
from the alumni, they are entitled
to know how the system has been
conducted, or rather, has worked
itself out during the past season.
''Under the new system the cap
tain of the team acts as head coach.
This season three graduates were
employed to assist Captain Warner
throughout the season. So far as
possible all the old graduate players
were notified before the season
opened that their services would be
expected on Percy Field at certain
fixed dates to assist in the coaching.
In other words certain graduate
players were scheduled for each
week, and so arranged that the four
regular coaches could expect assist
ance each week during the entire
season.
"The first proposition that pre
sented itself after the season opened
was the manner in which to con
duct the coaching systematically.
The old graduates who came back
early in the season offered a solu
tion that was approved by all. They
stated that inasmuch as they were
with the regular coaches for only a
short time, for them to direct the
general policy of the team and the
style of plays to.be used might lead
to confusion and derange plans al
ready made. They suggested that
their work be assigned them by the
regular coaches in such a manner
as would accomplish the best re
sults. Pursuant to this arrange
ment the material was divided into
"squads," each regular coach and
graduate coach taking a squad and
drilling each man therein in the
fundamentals of the game. Hy this
method each man trying for the
team received instructions in fund
amental football from an old Cor
nell player who, at some time, had
played the same position for which
the candidate was trying. This in
struction in fundamental football
took place during the early part of
every afternoon throughout the
season."
