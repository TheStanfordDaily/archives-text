# DIRECTORS ELECTED.
## Harter, Dittmar, Studley, Dehy and Copp Were Chosen By the Inn Club. 
### 
L. E. Harter, C. F. Dittmar, C.
K. Studley, J. G. Dehy, and A. J.
Copp Jr. were elected to the board
of directors of the Inn Club at a
meeting of the members held last
evening. An attempt was made to
re-elect the entire temporary board
which has served up to the present
time, but C. T. Hayden will not re
turn to the University ibis semes
ter, and Cantwell and McCormick
stated that they would be unable
to serve. Harter and Dittinar, who
have acted as president and secre
tary of the board, and who are
thoroughly familiar with all the
details, were re-elected. The new
members were chosen unanimously.
A vote of thanks was given the
members of the temporary board
which has devoted so much time in
perfecting the preliminary details.
Among other things an amend
ment to the articles was proposed,
which provides for three directors
to be elected in January, and two
in September of each year, thus
preventing an entire change in the
personnel from taking place at one
time. This cannot be acted upon
until it has been posted for three
days.
The financial statement given in
the Daily Palo Alto last evening
was placed on a bulletin-board be
fore the assembly, and the showing
was well received. President Har
ter. who presided over the meeting,
stated that if there were fifty more
members boarding at the Inn, the
price could be reduced by two
dollars a month. One of the sug
gestions made by tlie directors was
for each table to appoint a repre
sentative through whom all com
plaints and suggestions could be
reported to the management.
