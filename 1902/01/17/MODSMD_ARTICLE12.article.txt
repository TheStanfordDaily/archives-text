Speaking of the ball after the
close of the musical clubs' concert
at Coronado, the San Diego Union
says:"The college contingent de
clared themselves as having had
the most glorious evening of their
trip, praising the ballroom and the
accommodations of the hotel." It
doesn't say that they praised the
management. In fact, the boys
say that they left Coronado before
the ball commenced. There seems
to be some confusion in the reports.
