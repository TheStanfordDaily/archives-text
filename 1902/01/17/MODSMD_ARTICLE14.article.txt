Messrs. Dittmar, Cantwell, Hay
den, and McCormick, and especially
President Harter who has been
most active in promoting the proj
ect, have earned the gratitude not
alone of the members of the Inn
Club, but of the entire University
community, for their services on
the temporary board of directors in
successfully inaugurating the enter
prise and placing it on a solid
basis. The Inn is a public con
venience in which everyone is in
terested. The most difficult work
—that of organization—is now ac
complished, and patrons are al
ready well satisfied.
