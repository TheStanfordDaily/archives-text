# California's Two Universities.
## 
### 
The San Francisco Chronicle
calls attention to the fact that there
are but two States in the Union
that have more than one univer
sity of the first rank. The one is
New York with Columbia and Cor
nell; the other is California with
the State University and Stanford.
Together California and Stanford
have more students than Cornell
and Columbia, and both have
greater possibilities for expansion.
The State university is second in
undergraduate attendance among
the universities of the country, and
Stanford is the richest. Both, too,
are free, and Columbia and Cornell
charge heavy fees.
