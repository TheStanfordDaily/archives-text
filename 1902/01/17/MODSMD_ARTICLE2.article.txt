# No Firemen's Fund Team.

### 
Manager Edwards and Ezra I)e-
Coto, treasurer of the Berkeley stu
dent body, yesterday held a con
ference in San Francisco vvitli
Henry Hutton, president of the
Fireman's Fund Insurance Com
pany, relative to the baseball team
which the Insurance company
generally organized at this season
of the year. Mr. Hutton, who is a
baseball enthusiast, was anxious to
get out a nine to meet the univer
sity organizations, but owing to a
press of work in the office he will
not be able to do so this season.
This is much regretted by the play
ers both of Berkeley and Stanford,
who have always found the Fire
men excellent ball players and
gentlemen.
Treasurer Edwards has not yet
definitely arranged a schedule for
the season with any of the teams
but will do so immediately. A
nine from the Olympic Club will
probably take the place that in for
mer years has been held by the
Firemen's Fund Insurance Com
pany.
