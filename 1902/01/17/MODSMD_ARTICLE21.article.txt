The most readable article in No.
8 of the Sequoia, which appeared
yesterday, is "The Story of a Dog,"
by Isaac Russell, '04. The dog was
a through bred. So was the hero;
the girl too â€”for there was a girl, of
course. But the story is centered
in the firing-line at Manila, and is
written in a vein that is reminis
cent, of Conan Doyle's "Brigadier
Girard."
Other articles are stories, "They
Also Love" by Edith F. Parsons,
'03, "An Experience," by Ed. Gil
man, ex-'Ol, and a clever little
sketch by Waldemar Young, '04,
entitled, "The Only Married Man."
The Sketch-Book contains "Greater
Love Hath No Man" by L. L. Loof
bourovv, '02, and "A Fable of a
Bridge" by Edith Spencer, '04.
There is also some creditable lyric
verse by Miss Higgins.
