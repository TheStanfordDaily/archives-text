# PLEASED THE AUDIENCES.
## How the Clubs Were Received at Coronado, San Diego, and Los Angeles. 
### 
Below are the comments made bj
the press on the appearance of the
musical clubs at Coronado, Sar
Diego, and Los Angeles:
AT CORONADO.
A brilliant audience from hotel
beach and across the bay assem
bled to hear the Stanford boys in
their concert. Each car brought
visitors, and by the time of the
opening numbers the ballroom
was filled with an enthusiastic
audience. The program was made
up of pretty music, fun and non
sense, all well done, with no pre
tense at anything outside theii
grasp individually or collectively:
and for every number an encore
sometimes two, were demanded by
the cordial audience which packed
the theater. All the instrumental
numbers went with a precision,
nerve, and spirit that was both ad
mirable and infectious. In the
work of all there was the excellence
and assurance that goes with early
and often practice. Crisp martial
marches, dreamy Spanish waltzes,
irresistablerag-time,—all these and
other things equally enjoyable
were contributed by the Mandolin
Club. Humorous glees and regu
lar college songs were presented by
the Glee Club. After this the floor
was cleared and dancing occupied
the time of the young people for
the rest of the evening, every one
going in for a good time. —San Diego
(. Jnion.
EVERY NUMBKR ENCORED.
College singers and musicians are
not to he taken seriously. In fact
they do not expect to be taken this
way, for life to them is pretty
nearly all "one glad, sweet song."
When the song isn't "sweet" it is
funny.
This was the state of affairs last
night at the Stanford Glee and
Mandolin Clubs concert given at
the Los Angeles Theater. The
people had come not to hear classi
cal music, which they neither un
derstand nor care for, but to he
entertained, and the Stanford boys
did this royally.
That this was appreciated was
shown by the applause that fol
lowed each selection. There were
one or more encores for every num
ber on the program, and sometimes
there were two.
First of all there was a Stanford
song, "One, Two, Three, Four," by
the combined clubs, for the students
are loyal to their college first, last,
and all the time; and so they ended
with a Stanford "Hail, Stanford,
Hail."
Then there were coon songs, rol
licking college songs, drinking
songs, and"The Harp That Once
Thro' Tara's Halls," and enough
more old and new compositions to
give indications of an extensive re
pertoire. The members of the Glee
Club have excellent, well-trained
voices, and too much cannot be
said in praise of their leader, F. A.
Corbusier.
The Mandolin and Guitar Club
get from their instruments as much
music as it is possible to coax from
mandolins and guitars. Their
rendition of the "Florodora" sextet,
"Tell Me, Pretty Maiden," was es
pecially pleasing, for people have
not tired of it although it now be
longs to the class labeled "popular
music." There were other good
things by the Mandolin and Guitar

Club, namely, the "Zamona Inter
mezzo," selections from"The Sing
ing Girl," and a march, "Hail to
the Spirit of Liberty."
Then there is "Mr." Byrne. He
probably has a Christian name.
"Mr." is too dignified, for "Mr."
Byrne, as it is written on the pro
grams, tells funny stories and tells
them well, with an accent that is
easily mistaken for the real thing.
These are not all the attractions
of the club. There is "Mr." Ols
hausen —the "Mr." goes only with
his dress suit —who knows how to
play the flute well; and Messrs.
Baker and Bush.
With a laughter-provoking imi
tation of grand opera, they made
the hit of the evening. Their
"Tired" song, which was given as
an encore, was especially clever.—

ANNUAL VISIT POPULAR.
The Stanford Varsity Glee and
Mandolin Clubs held the boards at
Unit}' Hall last evening before a
large and cultured audience of lo
cal music lovers. These organiza
tions are among the most popular
that ever appear in Southern Cali
fornia, and their annual visit is
ever looked forward to with antici
pated pleasure as one of the necces
sary adjuncts of the holiday season.
The program was the usual inter
mixture of fun and pathos, from
the rollicking college song to the
higher pieces of technical music.
The Mandolin Club plays with fin
ish and effectiveness, which be
tokens not only talent in the in
dividual players but long practice
and patient effort. The Glee Club
contains some excellent voices.
One of the best mandolin numbers,
which brought down the house with
its now familiar strains, was Stew
art's "Tell Me, Pretty Maiden,"
from "Florodora." The encores
were gracefully responded to by
quick catchy pieces which left a
pleasing impression on the audi
ence. —San Diego Union, Dec. 25,

going in for a good time. —San Diego

EVERY NUMBKR ENCORED.
College singers and musicians are
not to he taken seriously. In fact
they do not expect to be taken this
way, for life to them is pretty
nearly all "one glad, sweet song."
When the song isn't "sweet" it is
funny.
This was the state of affairs last
night at the Stanford Glee and
Mandolin Clubs concert given at
the Los Angeles Theater. The
people had come not to hear classi
cal music, which they neither un
derstand nor care for, but to he
entertained, and the Stanford boys
did this royally.
That this was appreciated was
shown by the applause that fol
lowed each selection. There were
one or more encores for every num
ber on the program, and sometimes
there were two.
First of all there was a Stanford
song, "One, Two, Three, Four," by
the combined clubs, for the students
are loyal to their college first, last,
and all the time; and so they ended
with a Stanford "Hail, Stanford,
Hail."
Then there were coon songs, rol
licking college songs, drinking
songs, and"The Harp That Once
Thro' Tara's Halls," and enough
more old and new compositions to
give indications of an extensive re
pertoire. The members of the Glee
Club have excellent, well-trained
voices, and too much cannot be
said in praise of their leader, F. A.
Corbusier.
The Mandolin and Guitar Club
get from their instruments as much
music as it is possible to coax from
mandolins and guitars. Their
rendition of the "Florodora" sextet,
"Tell Me, Pretty Maiden," was es
pecially pleasing, for people have
not tired of it although it now be
longs to the class labeled "popular
music." There were other good
things by the Mandolin and Guitar

Club, namely, the "Zamona Inter
mezzo," selections from"The Sing
ing Girl," and a march, "Hail to
the Spirit of Liberty."
Then there is "Mr." Byrne. He
probably has a Christian name.
"Mr." is too dignified, for "Mr."
Byrne, as it is written on the pro
grams, tells funny stories and tells
them well, with an accent that is
easily mistaken for the real thing.
These are not all the attractions
of the club. There is "Mr." Ols
hausen —the "Mr." goes only with
his dress suit —who knows how to
play the flute well; and Messrs.
Baker and Bush.
With a laughter-provoking imi
tation of grand opera, they made
the hit of the evening. Their
"Tired" song, which was given as
an encore, was especially clever.—

ANNUAL VISIT POPULAR.
The Stanford Varsity Glee and
Mandolin Clubs held the boards at
Unit}' Hall last evening before a
large and cultured audience of lo
cal music lovers. These organiza
tions are among the most popular
that ever appear in Southern Cali
fornia, and their annual visit is
ever looked forward to with antici
pated pleasure as one of the necces
sary adjuncts of the holiday season.
The program was the usual inter
mixture of fun and pathos, from
the rollicking college song to the
higher pieces of technical music.
The Mandolin Club plays with fin
ish and effectiveness, which be
tokens not only talent in the in
dividual players but long practice
and patient effort. The Glee Club
contains some excellent voices.
One of the best mandolin numbers,
which brought down the house with
its now familiar strains, was Stew
art's "Tell Me, Pretty Maiden,"
from "Florodora." The encores
were gracefully responded to by
quick catchy pieces which left a
pleasing impression on the audi
ence. —San Diego Union, Dec. 25,

Below are the comments made bj
the press on the appearance of the
musical clubs at Coronado, Sar
Diego, and Los Angeles:
AT CORONADO.
A brilliant audience from hotel
beach and across the bay assem
bled to hear the Stanford boys in
their concert. Each car brought
visitors, and by the time of the
opening numbers the ballroom
was filled with an enthusiastic
audience. The program was made
up of pretty music, fun and non
sense, all well done, with no pre
tense at anything outside theii
grasp individually or collectively:
and for every number an encore
sometimes two, were demanded by
the cordial audience which packed
the theater. All the instrumental
numbers went with a precision,
nerve, and spirit that was both ad
mirable and infectious. In the
work of all there was the excellence
and assurance that goes with early
and often practice. Crisp martial
marches, dreamy Spanish waltzes,
irresistablerag-time,—all these and
other things equally enjoyable
were contributed by the Mandolin
Club. Humorous glees and regu
lar college songs were presented by
the Glee Club. After this the floor
was cleared and dancing occupied
the time of the young people for
the rest of the evening, every one
going in for a good time. —San Diego
