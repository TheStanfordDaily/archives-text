# Work on the Track.

### 
The track men in a cold wind
went through some light jogging
last night under the direction of
the trainer. Quite a number of the

men who were not out the evening
before appeared at the oval and
commenced training for the season.
From now on men are expected to
make themselves as nearly clock
working machines as possible, eat
ing, sleeping, and working regu
larly. All dissipation must cease.
The attitude of the trainer and of
the captain is well understood by
the men. Men who, previous to
this season, have continued break
ing rules up to a week or two be
fore the final contest, have already
"sworn off" all things not strictly
in keeping with an athlete's be
havior.
The new men will be watched
very closely by Moulton, in order
to discover their strong qualities
and if possible to pick for them the
events for which they are best
fitted. Sometime within the next
week or two each man will undergo
a personal try-out of some sort and
from that time on will devote him
self to the event for which he is
best fitted.
