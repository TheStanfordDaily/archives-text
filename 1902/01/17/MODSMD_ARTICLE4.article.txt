took place yesterday evening, and
was very successful. The main
work of the semester will be de

Professor Young intends to give a
Mendelssohn evening sometime
before the performance of the Greek
play, at which some of the music
of the latter will be played.
The Orchestra, as organized this
semester, promises to be strong.
There are still needed, however,
more violas, cellos, and claironets,
and anyone playing these instru
ments will be welcomed at the re
