# Musical Clubs' Concert.
## 
### 
The program for Friday night's
return concert had to he jumbled
about about a hit* at short notice
because of the inability of the Glee
Cluh's leader, Corbusier, to appear
and carry out his part. The loss
by graduation of Olshausen and his
liute was also evidenced in the per
formance, but under the conditions
the musicians acquitted themselves
creditably, and at times brilliantly.
The audience was rather small, but
manfully appreciative, and no
number escaped without an encore.
The Mandolin Club won especial re
cognition. Stanford has not had a
better one. The members play with
harmony and finish and a dash
that is infectious, never suffering
their work to fall below the level of
excellence. The specialties were of
a class that would do credit to pro
fessional vaudeville, the applause
that followed the monologues of
Byrne, '05, and the burlesque songs
of Baker, '03, and Bush, '05, being
more than a matter of sentiment.
Financially, the concert brought
in a tidy sum, although the sale of
tickets was not phenomenal. The
receipts were $140, and the expenses
were about $30.
