# Date for Carnot Debate.
## 
### 
Preparations for the Carnot de
bate, which will be held in Berke
ley on February 14th, are nearing
completion. The U. C. chooses
her champions this evening, and
as those who uphold the Cardinal
have already been selected, it is
now a question of work for both
sides. The positions of our men
have already been decided upon,
and will be announced as soon as
California's debaters are chosen.
As provided in the rules governing
the Carnot, each university is to
have her team divided, one mem
ber upon one side and two upon
the other. It has been a matter of
interest to know how the order
would fall. The Stanford team
happened to be chosen in the finale
from speakers upon the negative.
As decided by a toss, Stanford will
have one affirmative speech and
two speeches upon the negative,
but to whom these positions fall,
is not yet announced.
