# Problem of the High School.
## 
### 
Last Thursday evening the
Education Journal Club, which
met at the home of Professor Star
buck, considered recent discussions
on the problem of the High School
in its organization and relation to
the University. At the recent
State Teachers' Association the
sentiment was almost unanimous
in favor of establishing training
schools for the preparation of high
school teachers. It is noteworthy
that educational interest has turned
vigorously toward this aspect of
the school system, and the High
School in its relation to the Uni
versity and to practical life was a
leading topic at the last meeting of
the National Educational Associa
tion and of the New England High
School and College Association.
The interest in these points is the
outgrowth, in part, of the strength
and weakness of the report of the
Committee of Ten, and of the rapid
development in the number and at
tendance of secondary schools.
The State Association, after
giving the matter extended con
sideration, appointed a committee
to take the problem of secondary
education under consideration dur
ing the coming year, and report to
the Association next year. The
aspect of the high school, which
has especial interest just now for
the people of California, is the pro
posed amendment to the constitu
tion giving it State support, thus
bringing it in line with the primary
and grammar departments and the
University. The present law was
enacted in 1879, when high school
education was regarded as possible
only for the favored few. It stiin Is
now as an anomaly in school legis
lation. It is hoped by educators
that the sentiment in the St;ite will
be sufficiently a roused to pass the
proposed amendment next fall.
