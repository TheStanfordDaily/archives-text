### 
Already three dates have been
set for meets with the big univer
sities of the Atlantic Coast,and two
more are being negotiated for with
good prospects of favorable settle
ment, says The Call, in speaking of
the approaching trip East by the
California track team. The sixth
and last meet will lie in Chicago in
the Western Intercollegiate Field-
Day, which will take place in the
early part of June. The universi
ties which California wishes to
compete with are Yale, Harvard,
Princeton, and Pennsylvania, the
four she met two years ago. Dates
for tield-days have already been
made with the last two named, and
on May 10 California will meet
Pennsylvania, and on May '24
Princeton. The Mott Haven
games of May 31 will also be
entered, and there the hardest light
for places will take place. This
last meet is a contest between all
the big universities, and is held on
Manhattan oval, in New York.
