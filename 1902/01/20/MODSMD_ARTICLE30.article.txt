### 
The Beatitudes were the basis of
Dr. Halsey's address before the
Christian Associations last night,
his subject being "Vital Christian
ity." His plea in brief was for
purity of heart and altruism,
"Blessed are the pure in heart" be
ing considered by the speaker as
the climax of the Beatitudes.
