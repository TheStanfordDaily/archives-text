# THE 						1903 "Quad."
## Work More Nearly Completed Than Ever Before at This Time of the Year. 
### 
The 1903 Junior Annual is more!
nearly completed than any previ- j
ous annual has been at this time
of the year. All work not purely
editorial is already done or well
under way. Photographs are
handed in, and printing contracts
are let. Stories and poems have
not all been submitted, as the time
for their competition has not yet
expired. Much good material is
expected, but the editors urge all
who can to submit work.
The volume is dedicated to the
Honorable S. F. Leib, President of
the Board of Trustees. This is a
titling tribute to Mr. Leib and to
the work and devotion that he has
given to the University. The book
will be a memorial edition in honor
of the opening of the University.
It will include articles by promi
nent members of the faculty on va
rious subjects relating to the open
ing and early days of Stanford.
The design on the cover will be
a dignified block of lettering, sunk,
and done in gilt bronze. Fine,
smooth, heavy plate paper, such as
has been found most useful and
most desired by the public, will be
used. A novel feature of the make
up will be large decorative draw
ings heading the various depart
ments, printed on soft, rich-tinted,
light brown parchment paper. Be
sides the value of these as art
features, they will serve to separate
the departments distinctly and to
facilitate reference. The engraving
of all the cuts will be the best that
can be secured, and it is confidently
stated that the half-tones will be
the best ever used on any of our
annuals, Great care will be taken
to have them distinct and to secure
a tone that shall be neither sickly
nor glaring. An attempt is being
made to secure color-plates of two
Original designs used for windows
in the new Memorial Church. The
value of this attempt, if successful,
is evident. In regard to tone and
work in general, it will be the best
possible, and it is hoped that its
excellence will make it a very im
portant feature of the book, in ac
cepting art work, the editors have
accepted none but the best, believ
ing that quality is better than
quantity, and that a little good
work is better than much mediocre.
An important feature will be the
devotion of a portion of the book
to the Memorial Chapel. Suitable
articles will describe the building
completely, and this chapter will
be illustrated by views of the
church in all its points. These
and other features such as so fine a
building alone could furnish, will
assure to this section of the Quad a
worth proportionate to the value
and beauty of the church and the
greatness of the achievement of its
building.
A new department—dramatic—
will be introduced. The past and
promised activity in this line seems
to justify the editors in this addi
tion. The accounts of the trips of
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs and
of the football team will also be a
feature of great interest. Great

stress will be laid on the athletic
department, as it is believed that
this branch of college activity ap
peals to the college public and to
the general public, and also stimu
lates student activity. More space
than usual will be devoted to pic
tures of the athletic teams, space
enough for full-length individual
pictures being allowed, in place of
the usual small space occupied by
group pictures only. In this con
nection full accounts and illustra
tions of all contests will appear.
It is announced that the josh
section, which the college still de
mands and in which it takes great
interest, will not be sligbttfd. The
joshes will be fast, funny, and nu
merous. No one will be immune.
