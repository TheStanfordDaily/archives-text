# Wants the Meet at Tanforan.
## 
### 
Treasurer Edwards has proposed
to the Executive Committee to have
the intercollegiate field meet with
California held at Tanforan track
instead of on the campus oval. He
believes several advantages would
result from the change, among
them being a larger attendance be
cause of the proximity of Tanforan
to the city. If the crowd were as
large as the one that attends the
meets in Berkeley the gate receipts
would be about $000 more than can
be expected here. People from San
Francisco would not need to leave
the city until after lunch, whereas
if they come to the campus it will
be necessary for them to consume
the whole day.
One of the most important con
siderations is that this plan will
allow the removal of the bleachers
from the oval to the baseball dia
mond. Before anything can be
done, however, the sanction for the
arrangement must be given by the
Athletic Committee, the Faculty
Committee on Athletics, and the
management at California. Ed
wards says that the -later will no
doubt favor the change.
