# FAILED TO ELECT.
## The
						Sophomores Scattered Their Votes Among Five Candidates for President. 
### 
Five warring factions, strenu
ously active in electioneering, a
heavy vote, and no decision as to
the presidency —these were the
features of the Sophomore election,
which occurred today at the north
end of the quad. Not in recent
years has there been such a hotly
contested light for the chair of any
Stanford class. And it will all
have to he done over again, for
none of the candidates got a ma
jority—or close to one.
This was the vote when the
count was made after the polls
closed: .J. Taylor, 54; K. F. Ken
nedy, 41; W. D. Patterson, 28; A.
Stevenson, 27; \V. Grossman, 24.
For secretary, \V 7 . F. Dunn gave
M. E. Van Dine a good run, win
ning out by 80 to 60; and Isaac
Russell captured the treasurership
by a good majority, defeating M. H.
Farrar 91 to 61. L. P. Bansbach
for vice-president, B. C. Bubb for
athletic manager, and M. A. Thom
as for sergeant-at-arms were the
only candidates for those offices,
and were therefore elected unani
mously.
The election created no end of
interest, not alone among the mem
bers of the '04 class, but also
among many from the upper
classes. From the time the polls
opened at 11:15 until the balloting
closed at two o'clock a large crowd
was gathered, and the interest was
intense throughout. The different
factions worked hard for votes, tel
ephoning here and there, and but
tonholing every Sophomore who
ventured near. As a result, the
vote was unusually heavy, and the
election close and exciting.
It is understood that at the next
election, which will be announced
later, the lowest three candidates
will withdraw, in order to secure a
choice.
