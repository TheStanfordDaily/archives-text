# Praises Stanford Organ.

A letter from 11. J. Stewart,
organist of the Phillips Brooks
church, Boston, to Manufacturer
Harris of the instrument now in
the Memorial Church, says:
"1 have much pleasure in plac
ing on record my appreciation of
your work, as shown in the noble
instrument lately built by you for
the Stanford University.
"In judging of any instrument,
we must always bear in mind the
two great essentials, tone and
mechanism. Some builders excel
in one department and some in the
other, but seldom do we find both
to be equally satisfactory. In the
case of the Stanford organ, how
ever, I found absolute perfection of
tone and mechanism. The rapt
attention of the thousands who at
tended my recitals is a sufficient
proof of the beauty of tone, a point
which was universally commented
upon by all who heard the instru
ment. As to mechanism, I have
seldom found an instrument re
spond to the demands of the player
with sucti absolute certainty. The
fact that, not only during my re
citals, but throughout the Epworth
League Convention, the organ was
entirely free from even the slightest
defects which almost invariably
show themselves in newly-erected
instruments, is something unprece
dented in my own experience. It
is a striking testimony to the suc
cess of your electric action.
"1 was particularly struck with
the orchestral quality of tone
which you have so successfully re
produced in certain stops.
"Even in the exacting selections
from the Wagner operas, I found
no difficulty in obtaining the tone
qualities demanded by the orches
tration, and of course no higher
test is possible."
