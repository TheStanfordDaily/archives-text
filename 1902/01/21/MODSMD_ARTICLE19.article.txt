# Berkeley Chooses Debaters.
## 
### 
The final Carnot preliminaries
at Berkeley last evening resulted in
the choice of H. L. Kothchild, F. M.
Allen, and L. E. Martin, with
Walter Kothchild of the Hastings
Law School as an alternate. All
are seniors. Martin represented
California in the Carnot debate at
Stanford last spring. All these
men took the negative side of the
debate in the preliminaries, as did
the men chosen to represent Stan
ford with the exception of Loof
bourow, the alternate, who debated
on the affirmative side of the ques
tion.
