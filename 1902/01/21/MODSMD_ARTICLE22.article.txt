# Santa Clara County Athletics.
## 
### 
Besides being members of the
State Athletic League the prepara
tory schools of Santa Clara county
are organized into the Pacific Ath
leiic League, with a schedule in the
spring of the year for baseball and
track events. The San Jose, Santa
Clara, Campbell, Palo Alto, and
Los Gatos high schools and the
the academy of the University of
the Pacific make up the league.
San Jose high school, which won
the field-day last year, will have a
stronger team this year, as will also
the Santa Clara high. Campbell has
always shown up well and will do
so again. Palo Alto and Los Gatos
have not been doing much for a
couple of years but, will in all prob
ability improve this spring.
The field-day will be held in the
latter part of A pril and will as usual
be a feature of high school life in
Santa Clara county. Aside from
the regular baseball schedule,
games may be arranged between
the preparatory schools and the
University of the Pacific, San Jose
Normal, and Santa Clara College.
The University of the Pacific has
some excellent baseball material,
including a good pitcher. About
twenty-live men are out at practice
each evening, a number equal to
that on the Stanford diamond.
The Normalites are conceded to
have one of the strongest teams in
their history. They have an experi
enced battery with Martin in the
box and Erie behind the bat, and
are said to be very fast both in
field and outfield work. They
seem confident of winning their
games against Stanford, Berkeley,
and Santa Clara.
Santa Clara's line-up has already
been given in the Daily Palo Alto.
The men have been practicing con
sistently and are now ready for the
first game of the season. Although
their team has not the material
that it had in the past, it will be a
hard aggregation for either univer
sity to defeat.
