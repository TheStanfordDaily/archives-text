The Inn has just completed its
first fortnight under student man
agement. The movemeut thus far
has been very successful and has
come up to the expectations of the
most sanguine. At the meeting
last Friday night in Encina club
room, ninety-four regular members
were reported. The number has
since increased, so that at the pres
ent time there are about one hun
dred. There are 120 chairs in the
main dining-room and every chair
is tilled at lunch, 120 to 150 people
being fed. At breakfast and
dinner there are fewer transients.
Sixteen regular waiters have charge
of the service in the dining-room.
On account of inconvenience and
conflicts of the students' hours,
their help has been almost entirely
dispensed with in the kitchen and
paid help procured. A separate
room for women is provided, and
while there are but few women eat
ing at the Inn now, the manage
ment expects the number to in
crease.
Mr. Strowbridge is taking espec
ial interest in the transient trade
and the women's room. He is mak
ing an effort to increase the transi
ent patronage by advertising,
through the drivers, by good
meals at reasonable prices, and
by prompt and etlicient service.
Thus far all the transients who
have expressed themselves have
greatly praised both the meals and
the service.
