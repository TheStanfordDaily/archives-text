The Berkeley correspondent of

" George Holmes Howison, M. A.,
Lfj. D., Mills professor of intel
lectual and moral philosophy and
civil polity at the University of
California, in his lecture before the
class in the history of philosophy,
delivered 011 Friday, made known
to the students that newspaper re
porters were not wanted in his
classroom, although he would glad
ly welcome all other adults to his
course. Professor Howison declared
reporters to be 'lost souls,' who

would not do to associate with a
class in philosophy.
" Professor Howison's remarks
caused unusual comment among
the students in his class, and he
was quoted freely about the cam
pus. Although declining to discuss
the subject any further, he state !
that in his lecture he made the fol
lowing remarks:
" 'We cordially invite graduate
students and adults not in the uni
versity to visit this course, pro
vided they are not newspaper men.
We want no reporters or corre
spondents. They are lost souls,
and we want no beings of that de
scription in our classroom unless
they have deeply repented of their
sins and promised to reform."'
