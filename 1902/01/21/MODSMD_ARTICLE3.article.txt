# New Lots on Row.
## 
### 
Work has been going on for
some time on the grading down of
the hind adjacent to and hack of
the Kappa Kappa Gumma house.
The short street connecting Lasuen
street to the county road will he
closed up and graded, making an
additional lot on Lasuen street.
This lot, with the two next to the
Kappa Kappa Gamma house, will
provide space for three new houses
which are expected to go up soon.
