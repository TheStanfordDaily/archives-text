# INTERESTING SERMON.
## Professor Burt Estes Howard Spoke in the Chapel Sunday with Characteristic Force. 
### 
The ch a pel sermon was delivered
Sunday by Prof. Burt Estes How
ard. In substance, he said:
"There is a sublime pathos and a
sublime heroism in the declaration
of the apostle Paul â€”'From hence
forth let no man trouble me, for 1
have branded in my body the
marks of Jesus.'
"Paul had become old before his
time, worn by bis labors and his
battles in service of principle. It
is pathetic that Paul should have
had to defend himself against a
swarm of upstart critics. Having
once dedicated his life to Truth
and learned for himself the mean
ing of life, he claimed the right to
think and to act, for himself.
''The experience of Paul was not
unique. It is the lot of greatness
to be misunderstood. After one
great soul has felt the need of the
world and has devoted himself to
long service toward that end, his
acts are too often assailed by little
minds too small to understand.
A life-time of labor should count
for more than one footslip or mis
take.
l 'A struggle against old tradition
is like the heroic struggle of a Titan;
it is more noble when tempered by
a divine contentment. The grand
est devotion is that which sur
renders its own strength uncom
plaining to the service of some
high ideal and of perfect Truth."
The sermon was as valuable as
any that has recently been heard
in the University chapel. A sy
nopsis cannot reproduce the enter
tainingness of it. Forcible illus
tration, odd figures of speech, and
uniquly coined phrases that fuse
sense with sound, are qualities
which made Professor Howard
known in the pulpit before he
came to his position here, and that
are still appreciated.
