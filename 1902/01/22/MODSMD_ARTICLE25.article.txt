## Spooner, '99, Studying Sanskrit With the Buddhists, Writes Interesting Letter. 
### 
D. Brainerd Spooner, '99, who
has been teaching English at the
Imperial School of Languages, in
Tokyo, Japan, since graduation,
recently went to India to study
Sanskrit with the Buddhist priests.
From Benares he writes to a mem
ber of the staff:
"Benares is wonderful, simply
wonderful, as regards the Sanskrit
language. What it would mean
to a Latin student to live in Rome
with the Forum restored, and daily
meet there with Cicero and his
like,—that Benares means tome.
Give me —or anybody else, it is
quite impersonal —give me three
years here and I'll read, write and
speak Sanskrit as no man in Amer
ica ever thought of doing. Think
of it, in the college here they speak
nothing else but Sanskrit. Given
three years in such an atmosphere
could you, or I, or anybody else
learn Sanskrit? You would have
been interested to hear my first
lecture under a new fundit today.
He had no book even; knows the
whole thing by heart; chants it off
and then gives a running com
mentary on it in the most extra
ordinary fashion, and as rapidly as
a Parisian speaks French.
"As to India itself, it is very dis
appointing. Indeed, the gorgeous
ness of the whole East is best
learned at home through the medi
um of Turkish rugs, carved screens,
silks, attar, and the Arabian
Nights. There is gorgeousness here,
to be sure, but it, like the fat, is
monopolized by a limited company.
Some swells are marvels of price
and color. At one show that was
here the Maharaja of Benares and
his suite came in on nine elephants,
and the jewels and gold braid on
the princelings with whom 1 stood
would have ransomed Rajah and
.all! Perhaps one man in a thou
sand is the despair alike of the
rainbow, the peacock, and Tiffany,
and for every fleeting whiff of attar
you have an overhanging cloud of
smoke and noxious hookah
fumes, The sacred Ganges and
its ghats are interesting. I could
hardly claim any of it was prosy,
still much of it is interesting that
you bold your nose to view; and
many things attract the eye that
make you shudder even as you look.
"I was amused today as I was
biking home from college to be
nearly run down by a camel. (The
amusement was a latter thought.)
It was very novel in its way. You
never know how large a brute a
camel is until you skim past bis
towering sides, your head just
skimming his back.
"The city doesn't seem the safest
place in the world. I never see
another white man there, and
sometime at night when I ve been
followed through those pitclf-dark
lanes by men whose thuggish aspect
1 discovered by lighting a cigarette,
—I've almost wished 1 hadn't
lighted it for my peace of mind. 1
always take a servant with me, but
he serves only to moving their
heels while 1 attend to the rest, for
I wouldn't exaggerate, and I have
not as yet. throttled a man though
I've wanted to, and all but thought
of it.
"There are very few Europeans
here; and my teachers, and all at
the college with a few exceptions,
are Hindoos."
