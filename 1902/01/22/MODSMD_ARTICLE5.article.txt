# MERCHANT OF VENICE.
## Mr. Bassett Gave Interesting Presentation of Several Scenes Last Evening. 
### 
Mr. I.ee Emerson Bassett of the
English department gave a pleas
ing presentation of scenes from the
Merchant of Venice in the chapel
last evening. The rain seemed to
have had no effect upon the size of
the audience, which quite filled the
hall. Probably everyone who at
tended had seen this drama pre
sented on the stage with a full com
pany and with every advan
tage of costuming, ycenery, and
complete action. No doubt many
had expected that a recitation hy
one man, being simply the recita
tion of selected parts from the play,
would lack the element of drama
tic interest, and lose half the force
of the usual performance.
The interpretation of Mr. Bas
sett was an acceptable surprise in
this regard. So far was it from
lacking vividness that the audi
ence was held undeniably, and
taken through the events of the
drama in full sympathy with every
character.
In the four scenes â€¢ which were
presented, Mr. Bassett handled
from two to eight distinct parts.
To do this required knack. Per
haps the most favorable quality
which was noticed is the ease and
naturalness with which the speaker
moved from one characterization to
the attitude and the tone of the
next. There was hardly a sign of
artificiality in this. Stature, posi
tion, gesture, and action were mod
ulated without offense and without
undue exaggeration, even in the
clownish, triumphant taunts of
Gratia no, at the climax of the
trial scene. To the central figure,
that of the Jew, Shy lock, Mr. Pas
sett properly subordinated the rest;
but one of the most pleasing pic
tures was the casket scene, where
the tenderness of Portia, her trepi
dation at the da nger of the choice,
and her indirect suggestion through
music to her lover, were by no
means poorly handled.
This recital showed the value
which rapidity and unity give to a
dramatic rendering in the hands of
one person. If Mr. Bassett sinned
in any regard, it was not by the
classic and detestable crime of
exaggerating.
As a conclusion, hy request, Mr.
Bassett gave Biley's "Knee Deep
in ,J line," an old favorite.
