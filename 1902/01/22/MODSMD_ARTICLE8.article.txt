(ire milking an effort to consolidate
the University post-office with the
one at i'tilo Alto. The latter, dur
ing the past year, has increased its
business to $8,000, entitling it. to be
rated as a second class office, with
the postmaster's salary $2,000. If
the annual receipts reached $10,000
it would be made a free delivery
office; and since the receipts of the
University office were $5,000 last
year, the object is to secure free de
livery by the consolidation. If this
is done, mails would probably all be
distributed at l'alo Alto, and the
carriers would start from there
to the campus. Under this plan
the present star route by which
mails are conveyed between the
railroad station and the Uni
versity would be abandoned.
It is stated that 'the campus office
might be continued as a station <»112
the town office. *
