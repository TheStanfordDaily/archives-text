# PROPOSED CHANGES.
## Alterations Which May be Consummated in the Intercollegiate Athletic Agrument. 
### 
The joint intercollegiate com
mittees of Stanford and the Univer
sity of California will meet at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco, on
Saturday at 1 :J3O o'clock, for the
purpose of considering several pur
posed amendments to the athletic
agreements between the two uni
versities. The committee from
Stanford is composed of C. A. Cant
well, '01, 11. S. Fisher, '02, Dave
Brown, '97, with J. Burt Gilder
sleeve, '02, alternate.
There will lie seven amendments
offered, of which Stanford will pur
pose six. The committee from the
University of California wants the
annual football game continued in
San Francisco. 'They claim that
the crowds can never be attracted
to either campus in such numbers
as to the games in San Francisco,
and they are going to make the
proposition for financial reasons.
The Stanford representatives will
probably defer action on this pro
posal, as the next game will be
held in San Francisco anyway, and
in the next year or two contingen
cies may arise that would make any
action at the present time unwise.
The morning papers of San Fran
cisco today printed reports that
Stanford wanted the annual track
meet between the two. universities
held at Tanforan Park this spring.
Manager Edwards says that lie has
made no such propositions; nor is
it likely that he will. The Stan
ford committee do not intend to
speak for this change, nor has there
been any desire on the part of
Stanford to have the meet pulled
off at Tanforan. Such a change
would only have a tendency to in
crease the feeling of professional
ism, and Stanford wishes to eradi
cate that as much as possible
The Stanford men will propose
an amendment in regard to the
athletic standing of students com
ing here from other colleges. There
will be a classification of all the
colleges and universities, and men
who come from any college or uni
versity of recognized standing will
have to remain in either university
one year before they will be al
lowed to compete in intercollegiate
events. However, students who
come from agricultural and mining
schools will not be affected by the
rule, and they will be allowed to
play on the same basis as entering
students. Then it is also desired
by the Stanford committee that
there be some agreement as to
special and partial-standing stu
dents, whereby men in limited
standing at Berkeley will be put on
the same basis as specials at Stan
ford.
Another amendment to he pro
posed is one bearing upon the num
ber of years a man can participate
in athletics. Ilerelofore a student
could compete four years in a 11 four
branches of athletics,---football,
baseball, track, and tennis; and by
the new rule it is proposed that the
four years constitute participation
in any of the four branches, and
that a student's taking part in any
intercollegiate event will count as

one year. Thus, if a man makes
the varsity football and the varsity
baseball team in his freshman
year, there will remain to him only
one year more in which he could
take part in both branches, or two
years in either one of the two
branches.
The last proposed change is in
the direction of giving the baseball
umpire the same powers in regard
to ruling players off the Held as I he
football referee now has. This is
to be done primarily to raise the
standard of baseball between the
two universities. In the last few
years the intercollegiate games
have fallen into a great deal of dis
repute among the San Francisco
people on account of the boisterous
element that is now such an annoy
ing feature of the games. It is to
do away with this boisterous feat
ure and to prevent the indulging
in personalities between the oppos
ing forces, that this change will be
proposed. There will probably be
very little objection from Berkeley's
representatives to Stanford's pro
posals, as it has long been recog
nized by both universities that
changes along the lines proposed
by Stanford have been greatly
needed.
Dr. Frank Angel I, whose persist
ent strong stand for the improve
ment of the amateur sport and en
tire obliteration of the professional
element on this Coast is always in
evidence, has been largely influen
tial in preparing these proposed
amendments.
