Although no serious conse
quences resulted from the run
away this morning, the passengers
were in great danger because of the
carelessness of the driver in leaving
his horses unattended when the bus
was full of people. This sort of
negligence jeopardizes the lives of
people who ride between the Uni
versity and Palo Alto, and calls for
as strong condemnation as the reck
less racing up and down Univer
sity avenue. Drivers should realize
Hi a t they are responsible for the
safety of their patrons.
