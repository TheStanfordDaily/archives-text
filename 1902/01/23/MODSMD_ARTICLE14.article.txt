That was a pretty good start the
baseball men made yesterday.
Early season ball, no matter liovv
good the players, always has can
didates more or less noticeable; and
in the first practice game of the sea
son, by a team composed largely of
heretofore 11011-Varsity men, on a
field that was mucilaginous with
mud, perfect playing was not to be
expected. It is the combination of
these circumstances that makes
yesterday's practice promising.
Swindell's good coaching was evi
dent, for the men showed considera
ble feeling for team work.
