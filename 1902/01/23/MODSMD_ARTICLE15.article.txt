Last Monday evening L. L. Loof
bonrow, alternate on the Stanford
Carnot team, was present at the
final try-out in Berkeley, when the
men were chosen to represent the
University of California in the ap
proaching debate. Yesterday the
Daily Californian published an ed
itorial bitterly attacking him for
"such ungentlemanly action," and
calling upon the press and student
body of Stanford to hasten with as
surances that the action was unau

thorized. If these debates are con
ducted publicly at California as
they are at Stanford, we see no
more occasion for condemning his
visit than there would be to censure
football men for observing the pre
liminary games of a team against
which they will play. It was cer
tainly not Mr. Loofbourow's pur
pose to "stoop to questionable
means to win.'' He did not go in
disguise nor did he try to conceal
his presence, for he met several of
the California debaters.
The objection to the visit is
summed up in the charge that "a
man well informed on the subject
debated cannot help but learn
much of his opponents' line of argu
ment, even if he does not desire to
take notes." It is unfortunate that
the incident has caused ill-feeling
at California. Had this been antic
ipated, had it been suggested that
the try-out was a rehearsal of argu
ments for the Carnot debate itself,
or had an intimation ever been
made that these supposedly public
affairs were not open to Stanford
debaters, the gentleman surely
would not have committed the in
trusion. When the finals occurred
here the Daily Palo Alto pub
lished as full a review of each
speech as its space would allow,
considering each one public proper
ty after having been delivered to a
general audience.
