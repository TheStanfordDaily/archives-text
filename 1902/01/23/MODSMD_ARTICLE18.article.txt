# GIFTS OF A YEAR.
## 1901 Marks an Epoch in Endowments to Educational Institutions. 
### 
The first year of the new century
set a high standard in its contribu
tions to educational institutions.
Mrs. Stanford's gift of $30,000,000
easily heads the list of single con
tributions, but the gifts of Andrew
Carnegie to various institutions ag
gregate a greater total. Beside the
$10,000,000 gift to provide instruc
tion for Scotch students only in the
Edinburgh, Glasgow, St. Andrews,
and Aberdeen universities, and the
founding of a new college at Gala
shiels, Scotland, at the cost of $500,-
000, he has given $5,000,000 for the
building of a polytechnic institute
at Pittsburg, with a promise of $25,-
000,000 more when it is needed for
the endowment fund. His latest
gift has been $10,000,000 for the
founding of the "Carnegie Institu
tion" for advanced study at Wash
ington.
Harvard received $1,000,000 from
J. Pierpont Morgan for a medical
school as a memorial to his father;
and from a Boston man whose
nnme is withheld, $100,000 for a
new building. William Sampson,
of New York, left the bulk of $500,-
000 estate to Yale. John Simmons,
of Boston, who died twenty-nine
years ago, provided in his will that
when the principal of his property
amounted to $2,500,000 it should
be devoled to the erection of a
college for women at Boston. The
estate reached the required figure,
and Simmon's College was founded
last year.
Wallace C. Andrews left by will
$1,200,000 for a girls'school in Ohio.
Brown University received $2,000,-
000 from its alumni. William Wy
man, of Baltimore, gave a sixty
acre plot of land for a new site for
Johns Hopkins University, on con
dition that $1,000,000 be raised for
the buildings, a sum which has
been subscribed.
GeorgeN. Kennedy gave $40,000,-
000 to Syracuse University, John
1). Archibald, of New York, $400,-

College, Conn., $10,000 from Dr.
Gurdon W. Russel, the senior

John 1). Rockefeller has given
$200,000 as a preliminary step in
founding a national organization
for medical research, somewhat

Paris and the Koch Institute at
Berlin. The institute will be erected
in New York, and Mr. Rockefeller
has promised $1,000,000 toward the
