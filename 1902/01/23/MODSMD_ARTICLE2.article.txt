# Fencing Club Organized.

### 
Last evening at a called meeting
at the Delta Tail Delta house a
fencing club was organized. The
meeting was called to order by A.
B. Watson, '04, as temporary chair
man. A. V. Babine was then elected
permanent president, and A. J.
Copp Jr. secretary-treasurer. All
present seemed to favor the organi
zation and, it will doubtless he a
success.
It is planned to meet once a week
in the gymnasium, probably from
7:80 to 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday
evenings, at the same time the
Gymnasium Club meets. A leader
will he elected later, and as the
club grows older possibly a fencing
master from the city will he brought
to the campus to give instruction.
Nothing was said about tourna
ments in the college or with other
institutions, but they will probably
conic as the club develops. The
club is not at present open to be
ginners, and the status of admis
sion will be determined later. It
will doubtless be restricted to per
sons who ha ve had some experience
in the art of fencing.
A .committee of live men was
selected to draw a constitution, to
select a name, and to discuss the
general policy of the club. They
are to report at the next meeting
on Wednesday, January 20th.
The charter members of the club
are A. V. Babine, A. J. Copp, Jr.,
