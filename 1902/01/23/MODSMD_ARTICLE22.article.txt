# Bus Runaway Averted.
## 
### 
One of the large Palo lAI to buses
came near having a runaway and
(serious accident this noon at the
quad. There whs no driver at the
head of the bus, which was loaded
with students. A team dashed up
in front of the horses, frightening
them and causing them to start
and jump around in a rather wild
manner. The driver rushed out
into the mud and caught the horses,
but not before several people had
jumped from the bus and several
more had been pretty badly scared.
A serious runaway might have re
sulted, but fortunately it did not
occur.
