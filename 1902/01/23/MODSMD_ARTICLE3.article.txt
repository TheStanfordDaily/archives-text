# STANFORD MAY NOT CONTEST.
## Track Authorities Averse to Entering Team for the cross-country Trophy. 
### 
It seems probable that Stanford
will not enter a team for the Olym
pic cross-country run to be held in
San Francisco on Washington's
Birthday. Considerable discussion
has taken place among the track
men lately concerning the event
and as a rule there has been a de
cided stand against putting a Car
dinal team in the field.
It is not at all feared that Stan
ford runners would not stand even
chances of again winning the cup
which they brought home last year;
but from a trainer's point of view,
considering the physical condition
and the relation which the best
men hold to the team, it is certainly
unadvisible. A four-mile race re
quires a long and strenuous exer
tion such as no man should submit
himself to without due preparation.
This was especially noticeable in
last year's team; Taylor ran an
excellent race but as a result came
near having to drop all athletics
for the season on account of the
weakening of his heart. At pres
ent the college has not five men
who are in a position to put up the
necessary race and still be in con
dition to go on with the training
for the Intercollegiate field-day
with hopes of as good results in the
end as they would have if they did
not enter for the trophy.
Of last year's team — Hamilton,
Sprague, Chadbourne, Taylor, and
Zschokke —Hamilton is not now
in the University; Sprague will
not be able to participate in athlet
ics, owing to his late illness;
Zschokke, who could easily take
a first place in the Intercollegiate
distances, has not yet appeared for
training; Taylor, who is working
at the hurdles, would be seriously
handicapped if he dropped training
for his event, even for a month.
This makes Chadbourne the only
available man of the five.
There are plenty of good men on
the track, and five could be easily
selected who could be counted upon
to cover the twenty miles in as
short time as any of the competing
teams. The question is one of ex
pediency. Shall the Intercollegi
ate be sacrificed for the cross
country run? The question has
not yet been finally answered. If
enough men express themselves as
desirous of entering a team, who at
the same time are willing to get
out and do the necessary "graft,"
they will be given every attention
by the trainer. Otherwise it is
more than likely that the cross
country run will be dropped, for
this season at least.
