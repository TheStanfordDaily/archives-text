# Tennis Tournament Saturday.
## 
### 
The first tennis tournament of
the season will take place on the
Encina courts at nine o'clock next
Saturday morning, provided only
the rain does not prevent. It is
the intention of the tennis manage
ment to hold as many preliminary
tournaments as possible in order
that the players, a majority of
whom are inexperienced, may be
come as thoroughly acquainted
with tournament conditions as pos

sible. This first, try-out, however,
is of special importance to the play
ers because the men securing the
first six places will be allowed to
substitute tennis for gymnasium
work. All who have any proficien
cy are urged to compete. Names,
accompanied by the usual fifty
cent fee, may be handed to Treas
urer Edwards or to Frank A. Leib
any time before Saturday morning.
