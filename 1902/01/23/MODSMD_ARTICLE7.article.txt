# Chicago Orchestra Coming.
## 
### 
The Chicago Orchestra, one of the
best musical organizations of Chi
cago, is making a tour of the West
and will play at Stanford Univer
sity on the afternoon of February
27th. The Orchestra is composed
of about fifty-five pieces, under the
direction of Mr. Roserbecker.
The programs resemble in musi
cal character those of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra and there is
no question but that a treat of the
highest order is in store for local
music lovers.
