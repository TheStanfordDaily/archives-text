# TAYLOR WAS ELECTED.
## The 						Sophomore Presidential Fight Decided Today By a Fairly Close Vote. 
### 
The Sophomores have chosen a
president. One of the most excit
ing elections ever held by an under
class at Stanford was brought to a
close this afternoon, and H)O4,
which began its struggle a few
days ago with five aspirants for
the big plum, has now a chief ex
ecutive who is not a hold-over
from last semester.
John Taylor, the candidate who
polled the highest vote in the pre
vious contest, is the man upon
whom the honor was bestowed.
Eighty-six votes were cast his way.
Karl P. Kennedy, his strongest
rival, got seventy-one, while A. M.
Stevenson, Jr., also ran thirty-four.
Had a majority vote, the lack of
which caused a deadlock at the last
election, been required, there would
have been no choice and still an
other contest would have been nec
essary. The candidates foresaw
this and before the balloting hegan
signed a written agreement to the
effect that a plurality should elect.
As a result, the fight is over, and
Taylor is in possession of the covet
ed office.
Hot and sizzling was the contest
from the time the polls opened at
11 o'clock until the judges walked
away with the ballot-box at 2
in the afternoon. The north end
of the quad fairly buzzed with poli
tics, more than one fair co-ed work
ing hard for her favorite; while
masculine outposts for the three
factions despatched envoys to the
different houses and halls and
pounced with figurative . avidity
upon anyone who looked like a
member of '04.
The contest had narrowed down
from the last time the three candi
dates met at the polls, and with
this narrowing came added in
tensity. Two of the original five
had withdrawn, W. 1). l'atterson
and Walter Crossman, their fol
lowers going almost equally to
Tavlor and Kennedy. Taylor
gained thirty-two votes over last
time, while Kennedy's increase was
an even thirty. Stevenson gained
but seven votes. The total vote
cast was 191, which is very heavy
indeed for an underclass election.
John Taylor, the succesaful can
didate, is a Physiology major and
is a graduate of the Santa Rosa
high school. He is a wearer of
Varsity "S," having won the 220
low hurdles in last year's Intercol
legiate field-day. lie is also a
member of the '01 track team, and
took part in the cross-country run
of last vear.
