With the baseball game at Santa
Clara tomorrow the intercollegiate
season for Stanford ought to begin
with that dash and determination
on the part of the Varsity players
which they are determined to make
the feature of their work during the
spring. The Catholic college
students have invariably proved
themselves mettlesome opponents,
and this year they are making un
usual efforts to defeat both the
large universities. Three times
Stanford has failed of winning the
intercollegiate series by failure to
attain concerted action in time to
make nse of it. A good showing
tomorrow will breed the confidence
that may prove of much avail in
subsequent games.
