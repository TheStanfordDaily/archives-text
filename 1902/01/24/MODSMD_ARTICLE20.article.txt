men of promise are Frank Curry,
captain and catcher of the Kansas
University varsity last year, and
Saeltzer of last year's Berkeley

Three thousand dollars will be
needed to send the track team to
the East, and contributions of two

every student.
MacGavin of last year's tennis
team, and Hunt and Braly of the
'99 team, together with Baker, '03,
Brown, '04, and Hendries, '05,
make up the tennis material for
this year at California. Braly and
Hendries will, however, confine
their time to baseball. An inter
class tournament will be held in
February, and the doubles champi
onship tournament, which deter
mines the make-up of the varsity
team, in March.
