# Professor Fish Operated On.

### 
Professor J. C. L. Fish was op
erated on for appendicitis at his
home in Palo Alto yesterday morn
ing. Professor Fish has been suf
fering for some time, but it was
thought that he would recover
without the necessity of an opera
tion. Dr. Stillman of Lane Hos
pital performed the operation, and
latest indications are favorable for
recovery.
