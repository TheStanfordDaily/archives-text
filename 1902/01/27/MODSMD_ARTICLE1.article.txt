# SANTA CLARA WON.
## Varsity Lost First Game by a Score of 13 to 7. Men Showed Lack of Team Work. 
### 
Santa Clara defeated Stanford 13
to 7 in the baseball game Saturday.
The score, although decidedly in
Santa Clara's favor, does not mean
that the game throughout need be
a source of worry to Stanford sup
porters*, for the team played as
good ball as could be expected at
thiH time of the season. They
were matched against a team
which has already approached its
height of excellence. The story of
the Santa Clara victory may be
told in a few words. A series of
"hard luck'' errors by Crawford
and Lowenthal coming at critical
periods, and a bad inning, cost
Stanford the game. Santa Clara
played good, clean ball; the players
hanging together well, showed the
results of the systematic coaching
by Graham, the San Francisco
catcher.
As a whole, Stanford played
well. Brown at third did good
work. Copp in center-field played
a rattling good game, successfully
taking six out of seven chances,
and making a throw to the home
plate, which caught the runner
from third. McGilvray also put
up a good game. His one throw
to second was clean and fast,
though muffed after reaching its
destination. Parker does not yet
have his arm in Varsity shape, and
did not let it out during the game.
He has all his old-time speed and
curves, although he is still lacking
in control.
Keefe, the Santa Clara pitcher,
is a systematic performer, although
the .visiting team found little
trouble in hitting him on Saturday.
During the game Stanford made
eight hits off Keefe, and Santa
Clara seven off Parker. Keefe
walked three men and Parker four,
filling the bases with three of them
in one inning. Lowenthal is new
at infield work, and was handi
capped by an injury to his hand
early in the game, and by the
benches and spectators around first
base. The Stanford men did fairly
well in the (ield, at the stick work,
and in running the bases. With
perfected team work, they should
be able to defeat Santa Clara.
The teams were made up as fol
lows:
Stanford —McGilvray, c; Parker,
