The Chajiarral of January 25th
issued today shows considerable
improvement from last semester.
The jokes are really good; the draw
ings are up to the usual standard;
and the editorial page gives evi
dence of a surer and more practical
hand. Mr. Tooley again speaks
after a year's silence. Especially
noteworthy is the poem "On the
Removal of the Ivy,'' by Hazel
Hope Webster, which is of a higher
order than the usual run of under
graduate verse.
