### 
Photographs of the Palo Alto
Stock Farm, presented by Superin
tendent Covey to J. Larkin, have
heen placed on exhibition in the
lutter's barber shop at Palo Alto.
The collection contains a picture of
almost every horse of world-wide
note that has come out of the Palo
Alto stables, and is of especial in
terest because the farm will soon
he closed out. The list of record
breakers is exceedingly large, and
of these famous horses this collec
tion contains the following photo
graphs: Palo Alto, 2:08$; Elec-j
tioneer; Arion, 2.07^; Piedmont,]
2:175; Clifton Hell; Mendocino,
2:194; Altivo, Rex ford;
Harry Morse; Albany Boy; May
flower, 2:304; Thad Stevens; Ben
Butler; Ajax, 2:29^; Longfellow,
2:19 A; Pedlar, 2:18$; Sunol, 2:08±;
Green Mountain Maid ; Abtlel 1,
2:23; Beautiful Bells ; Electioneer
with Reynolds, his driver ; On
ward Silver ; Eleata, 2:08$ ; Ido
lita, 2:12 ; Alix, 2:03$ ; The
Abbott, 2:03i; Boralma, 2:07;
and Betonica, Of these the
most interesting is the one of Palo
Alto, it being the only photograph
ever taken of the famous horse
when in company with the dog
which was known as "Palo Alto's
protector." The dog's friendship
for the horse has often been re
marked upon. He slept, rode, and
lived with Palo Alto throughout
a great part of the stallion's career.
Of the other horses many are fam
ous for their records, others for the
foals they produced. Aside from the
horses are several pictures which
are interesting from other stand
points. Among them views of the
Palo Alto training stable, of the
farm from the hill, and of "the old
tree.'' The latter is tli« tree under
which Senator Stanford sat to take
the time of the horses as they went
around the track. Some of the
pictuies dale back as far as 1872.
