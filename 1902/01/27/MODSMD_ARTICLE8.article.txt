### 
Richard Sheldon, the all-round
athlete of Yale, and his cousin,
Ralph W. Mersey of San Jose,
Tufts '86, a member of Zeta Psi,
spent the day at Stanford and took
luncheon at the Zeta Psi house.
Sheldon is now traveling for his
health and is on his way to Pasa
dena, but intends to return to Yale
next year. His record in athletics
is a brilliant one. Walter Camp
said of him that lie was the strong
est man who ever played on a grid
iron, and he is a world's champion
track man. He played on the'9s
Yale varsity football team, and
was picked by Camp for the second
all-American. Following this, he
was out of college until '99, because
of ill health, but he again played
football or. the varsity of 1900.
His track work lias been equally
notable, and he has accompanied
two Yale aggregations to England,
besides taking part in American
and Canadian contests. Sheldon
will probably participate in the
coming Olympian games.
