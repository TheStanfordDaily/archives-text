# BASEBALL SCHEDULE OUT.
## First Campus Game Occurs Next Saturday.—Coach Swindells Talks of Material. 
### 
The baseball schedule is com
pleted. Eleven games, filling every
Saturday from February Ist to
April sth, are slated, with the ap
pended promise of frequent week
day games with San Jose Normal,
Santa Clara College, and the Deaf
Mutes of Berkeley. This assures
Stanford enthusiasts practically a
continuous performance of the
national game. It is a welcome
prospect, and quite in line with
Coach Swindells' idea that the best
way for a team to learn to play
ball is to play ball.
This is the schedule, as just com
pleted by Treasurer Edwards:
Varsity vs. Alumni, Feb. 1.
" San Jose Normal, Feb. 8.
" Alumni, Feb. 15.
" Olympics, Feb. 22.
" Alumni, Mar. 1.
" Olympics, Mar. 8.
" Alumni, Mar. 15.
41 Olympics, Mar. 22.
" Alumni, Mar. 28.
" Olympics, Mar. 29.
" California, April 5.
All these games are to be on the
campus, except the one with Olym
pics on March Bth, which will be
at Berkeley; and they are all sched
uled for Saturday, except the one
with the Alumni on March 28th,
Junior day.
As shown by the schedule, the
initial contest will be with an
Alumni team the coming Saturday
—a time for the rallying of every
one who is proud to wear the Car
dinal. The bleachers are to be
moved from the oval and placed
again in the position they occupied
before it was thought necessary to
play baseball with an abbreviated
right field. The ''Alumni" team is
not strictly composed of alumni, in
the collegiate use of the word, but
the name is apt for the men who
are to play. They are "alumni" of
the game of baseball—good men
all —and close contests are looked
for. Many of the visitors are well
known to Stanford people, particu
larly Moskinion, who, for the past
two seasons, has distinguished him
self in games against the Cardinal.
The make-up of the team follows:
Graham, catcher, Santa Clara and
San Francisco; Moskinion, pitcher,
Oakland; Sykes, first base, Califor
nia; Edwards, second base, Stan
ford; McCabe, third base, Califor
nia; Hamilton, shortstop, Califor
nia; Morse, left lield, California;
lloag, center field, California;
Mills, right field, San Francisco.
Coach Swindells, who knows
baseball, thinks the Cardinal's
chances for a successful season are
bright.
"Our prospects are good," he
said this afternoon. "We have a
good hitting and a good base-run
ning team. What we need more
than anything else is team work,
and it will take some time to de
velop that. The inen are all new
to their positions, and that makes
the development seem slow. The
team will be worked up gradually
from now on, but it will be four or
live weeks yet before satisfactory

results can be obtained. Then
again the men won't be out of gym
work for two weeks yet, and that
spoils the evening's practice.
"The team is strong in the box.
We have three good men —Parker,
Tritch, and McFarland —each one
of whom is good Varsity material.
McGilvray ought to be a good man.
He has a fast arm, and all
the requisites. Crawford will make
a good shortstop; he knows the
game well, but the position is new
to him. The same thing holds
with Lowenthal on first. Brown
and Cowden are the only men in
the infield who have played much.
In the outfield we have Christie,
Knight, Kellogg, Copp, Wilson,
Traeger, and Doherty —all good
material. Those who do their best
hitting and base running and show
the most nerve will get the place;
we take it for granted that they
know the fielder's position.
"One of our faults every year is
a lack of nerve at critical times.
Some man falls down from stage
fright at a critical moment, and it
has been very disastrous. This
year the men without the nerve
will be weeded out. The only way
to do this is by playing a number
of preliminary games. Beside the
regular games with outside teams
there will be games right along be
tween the first and second teams."

All these games are to be on the
campus, except the one with Olym
pics on March Bth, which will be
at Berkeley; and they are all sched
uled for Saturday, except the one
with the Alumni on March 28th,
Junior day.
As shown by the schedule, the
initial contest will be with an
Alumni team the coming Saturday
—a time for the rallying of every
one who is proud to wear the Car
dinal. The bleachers are to be
moved from the oval and placed
again in the position they occupied
before it was thought necessary to
play baseball with an abbreviated
right field. The ''Alumni" team is
not strictly composed of alumni, in
the collegiate use of the word, but
the name is apt for the men who
are to play. They are "alumni" of
the game of baseball—good men
all —and close contests are looked
for. Many of the visitors are well
known to Stanford people, particu
larly Moskinion, who, for the past
two seasons, has distinguished him
self in games against the Cardinal.
The make-up of the team follows:
Graham, catcher, Santa Clara and
San Francisco; Moskinion, pitcher,
Oakland; Sykes, first base, Califor
nia; Edwards, second base, Stan
ford; McCabe, third base, Califor
nia; Hamilton, shortstop, Califor
nia; Morse, left lield, California;
lloag, center field, California;
Mills, right field, San Francisco.
Coach Swindells, who knows
baseball, thinks the Cardinal's
chances for a successful season are
bright.
"Our prospects are good," he
said this afternoon. "We have a
good hitting and a good base-run
ning team. What we need more
than anything else is team work,
and it will take some time to de
velop that. The inen are all new
to their positions, and that makes
the development seem slow. The
team will be worked up gradually
from now on, but it will be four or
live weeks yet before satisfactory

results can be obtained. Then
again the men won't be out of gym
work for two weeks yet, and that
spoils the evening's practice.
"The team is strong in the box.
We have three good men —Parker,
Tritch, and McFarland —each one
of whom is good Varsity material.
McGilvray ought to be a good man.
He has a fast arm, and all
the requisites. Crawford will make
a good shortstop; he knows the
game well, but the position is new
to him. The same thing holds
with Lowenthal on first. Brown
and Cowden are the only men in
the infield who have played much.
In the outfield we have Christie,
Knight, Kellogg, Copp, Wilson,
Traeger, and Doherty —all good
material. Those who do their best
hitting and base running and show
the most nerve will get the place;
we take it for granted that they
know the fielder's position.
"One of our faults every year is
a lack of nerve at critical times.
Some man falls down from stage
fright at a critical moment, and it
has been very disastrous. This
year the men without the nerve
will be weeded out. The only way
to do this is by playing a number
of preliminary games. Beside the
regular games with outside teams
there will be games right along be
tween the first and second teams."
