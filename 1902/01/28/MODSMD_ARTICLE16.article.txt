Whatkvkk motive may inspire
the effort to combine the campus
post-office with the one in Palo
Alto, it is not based on frendship
for the University. The purpose
is to increase the receipts of the
town office — and incidentally
the salary of the postmaster —
thereby securing free delivery
which would be extended to the
campus as compensation for the
loss here.
Hut free delivery would
not compensate. The volume of
the money order and registered
letter business done on the campus
shows that this office has grown to
be not only a convenience but
practically a necessity for the com
munity that patronizes it.
Even with mails distributed to
the dormitories, fraternity and
boarding houses, we should be
forced to to Palo Alto whenever
we received notice of a package too
large for delivery, or of a registered
letter, or whenever we yvished to
cash or to purchase money orders.
And if a sub-station were es

tablished, an has been suggested,
it would mean the loss of the name
Stanford University Post-office,
which is a distinguishing character
istic of the institution.
Palo Alto might he benefit
ted hy free delivery, but the
campus would not, under these
conditions. The town exists be
cause of the University, and any
attempt of the former to profit at
the expense of the residents of the
campus is a dangerous move.
