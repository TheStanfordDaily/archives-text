# Training on the Turf.
## 
### 
The track men have been exercis
ing for several days on the turf
back of tiie gymnasium, as the
track was too wet to work upon.
The cinders, when they arrive and
are spread over the clay, will make
the wet weather but a small incon
venience. At present the cla'y track
dries hut slowly after a rain. A
larger number of men than usual
turned out last night and did some
jogging and starting.
