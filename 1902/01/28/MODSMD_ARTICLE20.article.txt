# About the Mosaics.

The San Francisco Chronicle of
Sunday contained an interesting
article on the mosaics in the Me
morial Church, l>y Will 11. Irwin,
'99. It mentions the fact that this
work is not only the most extensive
piece of mosaic in the United
States, hut it is the first that ever
called Venetian workmen to Amer
ica.
The "Last Supper/' directly over
the altar, is a copy of si work of the
fifteenth century hy Cosimo Roselli.
The original is in the Vatican, and
no previous copy of the work has
ever been allowed. Mrs. Stanford,
however, in consideration of her
gifts to the church in this state,
was given permission to have it re
produced in mosaic.
An account of the method of
working is quoted in full:
"First, the head of the firm,
himself an artist and painter of
merit, copied the original paintings
from which the mosaics are taken,
many weeks heing consumed in (he
work with ihe 'Last Supper' alone.
When this was done, and the infi
nite shades of color had been deter
mined to a certainty, he ordered
the glass from which all Venetian
mosaics are made. This involved
dozens of shades; they came from
the factory in the form of little
cuhes about a quarter of an inch
square. Except for the green,
which has the appearance of bot tle
glass, it. would be hard to deter
mine the real material of these
cubes. They resemble nothing so
much as small, regular bits of par
ti-colored taffy. Then the work
men, each one an artist as well as
an artisan, followed the painting,
section by section, breaking the
pieces with a hammer over a wedge
to make them fit exactly. When
they were finished, all the little
sections were pasted face down
upon a strong sheet of paper, and
numbered to correspond to the plan
of the painting. In this way the
whole design was put together in
Venice; then, in sections not over
two feet square, but all numbered
to fit their places, I hey were shipped
to Palo Alto."
A section of the lobby in the
Museum is to be finished in mosaic,
and this, together with the work to
be done on the dome of the church,
will keep the Italians in this coun
try at least a year.
