# "20TH CENTURY RELIGION."
## Ethical Program of the Future Forcefully Discussed in a Notable University Sermon. 
### 
"The Religious .Program of the
New Century" was the topic of an |
unusually thoughtful sermon de
livered in the chapel last Sunday by
by Rev.T. B. Vrooman, who is temp
orarily occuping the pulpit of the
First Unitarian church in Ala
meda. Before joining the liberals
Mr. Vrooman was a Presbyterian
clergyman, and has occupied pul
pits in London, Worcester, Mass.,
Elmira, and Chicago. Following
is an outline of the address:
"The doctrine of evolution as
commonly stated may be said to;
disregard one element, —that of aj
conscious intelligence. The same
principles which govern the work-1
ings of natural evolution may be
applied to man's method of dealing l
with the world. To foresee and aid
the course of history is a practical
problem. A rational plan or trend |
of development can be substituted
for the hit or miss method of j
chance. Professor Summer has
written a treatise on the absurdity
of remodeling the world, but it can
not be denied that in every walk of
life man foresees history, makes j
programs, makes new connections!
on the switch-board. Man's safety
lies in a wider intelligence. Mil —
leniums are to be made faster than j
they may be born. It is possible .
not only to progress, but to accel- i
erate progress.
"The spiritual and social world
needs an architect. The same in
telligence that molds the material
world can mold the spiritual. Re
ligion can reform the world only
by the conservation and the direc- ;
tion of forces already at work, j
Emotion towar i God is useless uu- j
less combined with rational good
will to men. Christendom is paved
with good intentions; nowhere is
there such a force of emotion as in
the Christian church. But too
much is of the subjective, undi
rected sort. Maudlin sentimental
ity drives no wheels. In no Held
of the world is there such a reck
less waste of energy as in the
Christian church. More than two
hundred sectarian creeds, each
claiming to be the genuine teach
ing of Christ, are wasting energy
in their disagreements.
"We should try to find those 1
points on which we all agree, and I
work for them. The century calls
for a cause and for a leader. We i
lack a world view-point, a world j
method. A few simple lines are
needed, which will lie close to the
elements of life, cutting sharply
between right and wrong. We
need to live up to the simple in-1
tegrity of character and truth.:
Doctrines will take care of them-!
selves.
"A recent writer has suggested
as universal tenets these elements:
Regard for the weak and the poor,
respect for women, a realization of
the duty of raising up the brother
who is below you, hostility to slav
ery, regard for the sanctity of mar
riage, temperance, a sense for jus
tice between the employer and em
ployed, the equal political rights of
men, an opposition to war. and an
appreciation of the doctrine that
injury to one nation is an injury to
all. This world-program would
make all skepticism small. It is
suitable for our renaissance. Prot
estantism has failed because it was
subjective rather than objective

static and not dynamic, and be
cause it emphasized theology rather
than religion. The new chivalry
of Christendom will be to upbuild,
to redress human wrong. Here is
a creed broad enough to unite the
church, and beautiful enough to
save the world."
