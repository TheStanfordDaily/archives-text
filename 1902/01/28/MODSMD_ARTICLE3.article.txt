# Hawley Junior Treasurer.
## 
### 
The fight for the treasurership of
the Junior class closed this after
noon with the election of L. C.
Hawley after a close contest with
his opponent, F. E. Nangle. The
vote as finally counted stood: Haw
ley, 34; Nangle, 32. There were 95
votes cast, of which number 29 were
thrown out by the Board of Elec
tion on account of careless marking
of the ticket by the voter. Many
of the crosses were placed indis
criminately on almost any part of
the ballot, some after the name of
the candidate, some before and
after, some between the two candi
dates, and some before and after
both names. The instructions on
the ballot read, "Place a cross at
the left of the name of the candi
date yow wish to vote for,"and
the ballots not marked in accord
ance with these instructions were
declared void. By this* Hawley
suffered a loss of 15 votes and Nan
gle 14.
With the choice of Hawley lhe
last of the officers of the Junior
class is selected, the remainder
having been elected on last Wednes

polled, the present election showing
an increase of 9. At the previous
