## Men Running- Short Heats.—Cinders Promised Next Week.—No Tanforan Team. 
### 
The past two evenings on the
track have been largely devoted to
the running of heats in the fifty
and two-twenty, and to a few try
outs in the half-mile. The time on
about forty trials was taken for
comparison with the work later in
the season. Trainer Moulton is
making freer use of the pistol and
watch than has ever before heen
seen at Stanford, and he will con
tinue doing so throughout the sea
son, as by comparing time only can
a. man tell whether he is improving
or not. The trials so far have been
fairly satisfactory; excellent time
was made by some of the men for
this stage of the season, and in the
face of cold weather. Hamilton
has done the hest time in the fifty,
Moran in the two-twenty, and Mc-
Laughlin in the half-mile. It was
clearly proved that almost every
man on the track made a much
better showing with competition
than without. This is a satisfactory
feature. The quarter-mile men
have not heen doing as well as
they should, but will improve with
the approach of warm weather.
The men cannot do their best work
with the truck in its present con
dition. Part of the path is full of
holes and rough places, and the
runners undergo a constant danger
of turning their ankles.
Manager Edwards has seen
Superintendent B. A. Worthington,
at the Third and Townsend street
grounds, and made arrangements
for two car-loads of cinders, which
will probably arrive on the campus
sometime next week. The cinders
will have to be accumulated before
they can be sent down, for the stack
cinders only are to be used and
they will have to be separated from
the grate cinders. They will be
spread immediately, and better
work may he expected as a result.
With the improvement of the path,
the addition of the men who will
substitute track work for gym.,
and the approach of warmer
weather, increased activity may be
!-een during the next month.
The Olympic management pro
posed some time ago that a meet l>e
arranged for Washington's Birth
day between Stanford and Califor
nia, the proceeds to go toward de
fraying the expenses of the Califor
nia team on their proposed Eastern
trip, but the Stanford men have
rejected the idea as totally unadvis
able at this time of the year. Con
sequently no team will be entered
in theTanforan meet, a 1 though there
are no serious objections to mem
bers from the Stanford team enter
ing as individuals. However, but
few, if any, will do so.
