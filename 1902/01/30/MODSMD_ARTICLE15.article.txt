# Why the Church Is Closed.

â€¢ Hereafter a guard will be placed
at the new Memorial Church in
order to keep all visitors from en
tering the building, unless the)'
hear written permission from Mr.
Hodges. l ids step has been ren
dered necessary in order to protect
work going on inside the building
from being molested.
Some visitors have been guilt)'
of acts of inexcusable vandalism
and have seriously impaired the
work by taking souvenirs. A few
Sundays ago an enthusiastic me
mento collector made use of the
mosaic-artist's trowel in removing
the hand and forearm of Moses
from the figure on the wall, and
this was replaced at considerable
expense and inconvenience. Al
most every one who enters the

building pockets a few of the glass
or stone pieces used in making up
the mosaic. The individual of
fence is not serious, but when a
succession of losses occur this
makes trouble, especially for the
Italian artists. The guard will he
stationed at the entrance each Sun
day until the inside work is fin
ished. By that time the cement
behind the mosaic work will he
hardened so that removal of the
parts will he impossible.
