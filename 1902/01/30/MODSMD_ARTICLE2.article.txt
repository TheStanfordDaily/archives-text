# Preparing for Saturday's Game.
## 
### 
A section of the bleachers has
heen moved from the oval to the
baseball grounds, in anticipation of
Saturday's game with the Alumni.
The remainder will be brought
over in a short time, in case the
managers decide next week to hold
the Intercollegiate track meet off
the campus; otherwise, new bleach
ers will be put up on the diamond.

To the game on Saturday an ad
mission fee of twenty-live cents will
be charged. The men should play
better ball than they did against
Santa Clara, though deficiencies in
team work m'ay be expected.
Next week Coach Swindells and
Manager Edwards will appear on
the diamond with the second team,
the object being to make the oppo
nents of the Varsity as strong a
team as possible. The ill effects of
a Varsity playing against a weak
second team were seen last year,
and it is to remove this source of
weakness as far as possible that the
coach and manager will get out
their baseball clothes.
