Something of the success of the
Chicago S ymphony <)rchestrn,which
appears in the Assembly U;i II Feb
ruary 27th, may he gained from
the following press notices of its
work and its soloists:
"The Orchestra is one of the
finest organizations of its kind in

tlie country. 1t is capably handled
by Mr. Rosenbecker, a thorough
musician, and its members are each
conscientious artists. All parts
seem equally well balanced. The
opening number, the overture from
Tannhauser,. was admirably execu
ted. Strauss' 'Beautiful Blue Dan
ube' with its dreamy, graceful ca
dences, was greeted with hearty
applause. Any future appearance
of the Chicago Symphony here will
be tneeted with delight."—Minne
apolis Tribune.
''Adolph llosenbecker is a con
ductor of dignity and reserve, and
does not resort to false motions to
bring out the effects and shadings
which constitute the artistic- rendi
tion of a number. The concert was
■ I.success in every respect." —Ann
Arbor Times.
''The Chicago Symphony Orches
tra, which appeared at Chatterton's
opera house last night, is more
than its managers claim for it. A
superior musical entertainment
was doubtless never given in the
capital city, and an immense audi
ence was fortunate to be present.
The interpretation of Rossini, Liszt,
Strauss, Handel, Mendelssohn, and
other renowned composers was
most brilliant, Round after round
of applause was elicited by each
success!ve selection." — Springfield,
