# ATHLETIC CONTROL.
## Dr. Angell in the "Alumnus" Discusses Problem of Undergraduate Organization. 
### 
In the article by Dr. Angell con
cerning athletic control, published
in the January number of the
Alumnus, the writer makes the fol
lowing observations in connection
with the work to he done by the
committee on permanent athletic
grounds:
"Now it is not impossible that
this committee may in the course
of its work come to touch on the
question of athletic organization in
connection with the management
and maintenance of the athletic
fields, and if this is the case the
question of the introduction of an
alumnus element into our scheme
of athletic organization is pretty
sure to arise. That such element
is necessary to maintain, if not to
formulate, a consistent athletic poli
cy seems at present to be the opin
ion of most of those who have given
enough thought to the matter to be
warranted in having an opinion.
We have seen the football and base
ball fields shifted here and there at
the fancy of managers, coaches and
captains who naturally looked on
the particular branch of athletics
which tliey represent as a "hardy
annual" rather than as a perennial
growth. We have had bewildering
changes in our coaching and train
ing systems since first we began in
tercollegiate sports. J n fact it is
only in relation to Walter Camp
that we may venture to use the
word "policy'' at ;ill in connection
with our athletics.
"That we have not long since had
official alumnus influence in our
athletics is, however, mainly due to
the overzealousness to use a char
itable word—of some of the alumni
themselves, who a little over a col
lege generation ago evolved a
scheme for relieving the under
graduates of most of the responsi
bility of managing their own affairs
—a scheme which for vigor and
rigor left nothing to be desired. In
some mysterious manner it became
noised abroad that the alumi>i in
general, and the San Francisco
alumni in particular, were prepar
ing to "run" athletics at Stanford,
with the very natural result of
making the name of alumnus rep
resentation an " anathema " in the
minds of undergraduates.
"For the growth in our athletic
activities, to which we may reason
ably look forward in the next three
or'four years, it would seem that
our present machinery is inade
quate, and in whatever'the change
is to come —whether through exten
sion of the present plan, or by
adoption of a new one —it is to be
hoped that some place will be found
for the influence of disinterested
and tactful alumni who will have
at once the respect and liking of
faculty and students. It is not
necessary that these alumni should
be numerous or have either execu
tive or legislative functions. It is
not desirable or feasible that alumni
should supply the power to run un
dergraduate machinery; but it
would be well for them to act as
balance wheel—to have some official
advisory function. Last semester

we had alumni acting in a semi
official capacity —as graduate
coaches —and it seems to the writer
that the results are, in the main,
encouraging. There has heen less
friction between team and coaches
than in former years, the coaches
have won the respect and liking of
the men, and in addition have heen
the much needed medium for the
interaction of faculty and student
opinion. Had they heen somewhat
more stringent in the matter of dis
cipline, it would have heen better.
What Walter Camp charitably
termed the "independence" of some
of the men was a stumbling block
in the way of the coaches. It is not
probable that the same, or even
different coaches, would err again
in the direction of too great lenien
cy. But, taken as a whole, the ex
periment with graduate coaches
seems to show that alumni and un
dergraduates can work harmonious
ly and advantageously together,
and there is no reason to believe
that the relation might not be more
beneficial if it were continuous and
without money and without price.''
