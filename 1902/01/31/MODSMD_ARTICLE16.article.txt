With pleasure we announce the
addition to the Daily Palo Alto
staff of (). l)u K. Kehrlein, ii. C.
Dey, and E. H. Favre, whose work
on the paper for some time past
entitles them to their positions. In
this connection, it may he interest
ing to point out the different parts
of the country from which the
member√ü of the staff come to Stan
ford. The managing editor is from
Massachusetts, three associates are
from California, two are from lowa,
and one from Utah. Of the assist
ants, two are from Oregon, two
from California, one from Massa
chusetts, one from Pennsylvania,
one from Indiana, one from lowa,
and one from Utah. Probably no
other college paper has such a wide
extent of the country represented.
