# The
						Next ”Sequoia.”
## 
### 
The next number of the Sequoia,
which will he out the first of next

week, promisee to be an exception -
nlly good one.
The republication of R. J. Ster
rett's prize story, in magazine form,
will be appreciated by those who
were unable to secure it when it
came out in the San Francisco
Evening I'ost, while those who have
already seen the story will also be
glad to have it in this more compact
form. E. M. 11 uline, '97, a former
editor of the Sequoia, writing from
Cornell, was the first to suggest its
republication. The initial poem,
by Miss H. H. Webster, and a
longer poem by 15. 10. Remind, tire
the verse features. An article on
Japanese students at Stanford, by
one of them, will be of interest to
every one. "About It and About,''
by Miss M. L. Caldwell, and ''Mis
sion Bells," by Miss Florence Hey
wood, are excellent short stories.
