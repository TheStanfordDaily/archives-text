— Three college basket-ball teams
of the ICast have been suspended
by the A. A. U. —Pennsylvania,
Vale and Columbia —for playing
against suspended or unregistered
teams. Pennsylvania and Colum
bia have been reinstated, but Yale
is still under the ban, and as some
of her team have played in other
branches of athletics, it may prove
serious for her.—Minnesota Daily.
