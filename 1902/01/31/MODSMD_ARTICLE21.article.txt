# On College Journalism

### 
An editorial in a recent issue of
the Philadelphia Times' Saturday
liooh Review has the following to
say of college journalism:
When the Hon. Whitelaw lleid
received from Yale University his i
degree last October, Mark 1 wain ,
enlivened the occasion by remark
ing: "And yet they say that this
nice little school here does not en
courage journalism!' As the long:
procession of invited guests filed
back across the campus, Mr. lleid,
half turning in order to speak to j
Mark Twain, who followed two or
three couples behind, said: "1 hat's
how the colleges help us most." He
pointed as he spoke to a small boy
who was endevoring to violate the
proprieties of the occasion by sell
ing to the distinguished guests the
latest issue of the Yale Daily News,
which contained a very creditable
account of the ceremonies which
had closed about half an hour be
fore.
Time was, and not so very long
ago, when the undergraduate publi
cations consisted entirely of month
lies or weeklies, devoted to sopho
moric essays on Wordsworth or
(jreek fragments, with weak at
temps at verse or weaker attempts
at humor. It was a poor school of
journalism. Hut all this has
changed. The college magazine,
itself, is as different today from
what it was in the 70s or 80's as
the Yale of today is different from
the struggling institution which
fought its way from Say brook to
New Haven. More than this, daily
journalism has become a compo
nent part of undergraduate life.
When that step was taken a few
years ago, when Harvard started
the Crimson and Vale followed
with the News, Pennsylvania,
Princeton and a score of others tak
ing up the idea, two things were
predicted. In the first place, it
was openly said that the day of the
college magazine had passed. I hose
on the other side of the question
insisted quite as strongly that this
new movement was destined to die
an early death. Neither guess came
anywhere near the truth. Spurred
on by the progressive and up-to
date influence of the little dailies,
the college magazine developed into
the creditable thing which it is to
day; while the dailies, serving up
every twenty-four hours all the
news of the college world, made
themselves so useful that their per
manency was insured.
Incidentally, but inevitably, the
col lege daily trains the American
young man who connects himself
with it, in one of two ways —it
teaches him the methods of the
business oflice, introduces him to
both printer and advertiser, and
definitely instills that basic truth of
successful journalism that -neither
the publishing otfice nor the busi
ness oflice can successfully run
the sheet alone. On the other
hand, the college daily is making

reporters and editors. It is teach
ing the arts of gathering news, of
writing up one's items in a straight
forward, simple way, of boiling
down speeches, of building clever
introductions — of a score of things,
in short, every one of which tends
directly to make easier that young
man's entry into the field of jour
nalism beyond the college campus.
And that is what the editor of the
Tribune meant when he told Mr.
Clematis that the colleges were
helping the makers of great news
papers in a way far more practical
than giving them honorary derees.
There is one point in favor of the
training afforded a man by work
on a college daily which deserves
especial mention, lie is forced to
be what in newspaper phraseology
is termed ''conservative." lie is
forced to confine himself to the
exact news, just as surely as the
very limited space placed at his
disposal forces him to write his
story in the briefest and most di
rect manner possible.
