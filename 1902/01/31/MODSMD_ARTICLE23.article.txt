U. C. Co-eds Don't Vote
An effort is being made at the
University of California to encour
age the women students, to vote in
class elections. The recent sopho
more election showed that only 85
per cent of the entire class took
any active interest in the contest.
It has been decided that the reason
is that the co-eds are too timid to
come to the polls, and booths will
be erected in Hearst Hall to obvi
ate this difficulty in future elec
tions.
