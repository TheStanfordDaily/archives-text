# DEFEATED THE VETERANS.
## First Campus Game a Varsity Victory by a Score of 6 to 5. 
### 
As a contest indicative of what
may be expected from the Varsity
a little later in its season, Satur
day's 6-5 victory over the Alumni
was in many ways encouraging.
Although but a week had elapsed
since the careless work of the team
at Santa Clara, wonderful improve
ment was in evidence all around.
Errors were less, hits more frequent,
and every man seemed to have at
least a glimmering of what his
play should be at a critical mo
ment. Jt is the opinion of wit
nesses of both the recent games
that the Alumni were fully capable
of defeating the Santa Claras,
which,would make the week's im
provement discernible in the score
as well as in general development.

As a rule, the individual work of
both teams was good, a surprising
fact in view of the sloppy condi
tion of the diamond. The Stanford
battery worked with beautiful har
mony. Tritch held his own for the
full nine innings, keeping the hits
down, watching the bases closely,
and fielding his position in good
shape. 'Behind the plate, McGil
vray's catching was the best he has
done, lie and Knight also distin
guished themselves by each draw
ing a two-base hit from "Jimmy"
Lanagan's delivery. Crawford bad
to vie in the shortstop's position
with Hamilton of the Oakland
League team, who appears with the
old-timers, and the result was not
at all unfavorable to the Stanford
man. His two errors out of ten
chances were partly due to the

slippery footing. The calibre of
Kellogg's fielding was Varsity to a
certainty, and his stick-work was
equally satisfactory. Lowenthal
hatted well and brought in two of
the runs, but his two errors were
hardly excusable. Captain Cow
den's game was up to his standard.
For the Alumni, Christy, Califor
nia coach, who occupies tlie second
corner, Shortstop Hamilton, and
"Brick" Morse in the left field, were
in best form.
