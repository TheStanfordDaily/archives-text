# SERMON YESTERDAY.
## Dr. Barrows Gave an Impressive Discourse on the Lord's Prayer. 
### 
President John Henry Barrows
of Oberlin College delivered one of
the most polished and impressive
sermons heard in the chapel this
year, at the services yesterday
morning. He is a magnetic and
eloquent speaker of strong pres
ence, and bis discourse abounded
in examples and figures and was
marked by a wealth of vocabulary.
Dr. Barrows spoke on the Lord's
Prayer, drawing his lesson mainly
from the opening phrase, "Our
Father." Prayer he described as
the act of adoration, of confession,
of thanksgiving, of submission,
and, primarily, of petition. The
Christian idea includes the element
of communion. In the Lord's
Prayer the seven distinct petitions,
all in phrases taken from the Old
Testament, condense the spiritual
and physical wants of man. By
the term "Our Father," the frater
nity of all men is implied. A sup
plicant cannot come to God in the
spirit of selfishness, nor as the rep
resentative of any sect, cast, nation
ality, or social set; he must pray
in the name of the whole human
family. The word "our" blots out
the heathenism of cast, and is a re
buke to the paganism of social dis
tinction.
