# The 						Address on India.
## 
### 
Last evening Dr. Harrows held
the close attention of the audience
gathered in the chapel to hear his
address on India. He said that,
after all his travels throughout the
Orient, he had found nothing so
inspiring as the sight of his own
country, in the East, America is
most prominent in missionary and
philanthropic enterprises. Army
officers and globe trotters who state
that missions have accomplished
nothing, could learn something of
thejvalue of the work being done by
consulting the opinion of the great
statesmen and thinkers of the
Orient, who recognize the power of
this influence. Such critics, on be
ing specifically questioned, usually
reveal the fact that they form their
judgment without direct acquaint
ance with any missionaries or their
work.
Unlike Europe and America,
Asia is not united by the unity of
spiritual conception, but it is the
continent of diversity. The Hin
doos are the most intellectual and
fallen people in the world, the Jap
anese the most progressive, and
the Chinese the most tin progressive.
China is the greatest unused factor
among nations, for when it moves
it will move the world.
India is a country with one
fourth of the population on the
verge of starvation, and one-half
the women imprisoned for labor.
One and a half millions of the
Hindoos speak English in its pur

est form, for they learn it from the
Bible unci Shakspere. There is no
basis for the minor that Brahmins
are never converted to Christianity,
for many are seen preaching the
gospel. Missions in India are a
stupendous success. In the realm
of spirit, the most impressive sight
offered by the empire is a humble
Christian Hindoo home.
Dr. Barrows closed eloquently
by saying that there is no parallel
in history with the sudden enlarge
ment of national responsibility
that came to the American repub
lic: when Dewey fired the first shot
at Manila, bringing the nations of
the East 7,000 miles nearer the
center of modern thought. Hence
forth, the advance of the Christian
faith is to be inseparably entwined
with the commercial and material
welfare of the 800,000,000 people
living in the Pacific.
