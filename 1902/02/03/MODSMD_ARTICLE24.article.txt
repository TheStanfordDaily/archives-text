# WON BY LODI.
## Stanford Trophy Debating Cup Changed Hands After the Contest Saturday. 
### 
The Stanford trophy cup has
changed hands. It is now held by
the Lodi high school, whose team
defeated the debaters of the Hum
boldt Evening High School, of San
Francisco, in a creditable contest
at the chapel Saturday night.
Each team was supported by a
following from its school, numerous
and enthusiastic. The young men
and girls from Lodi arrived during
the afternoon, and were given an
informal reception at the Encina
club-room. By some delay the
Humboldt students missed the
earlier train, and the debate did
not begin until almost nine o'clock.
The size of the audience, and the
attention paid the speakers, were
commendable.
President McCormick, who intro
duced the speakers, explained first
the purpose of the student body in
offering the silver debating cup.
This trophy stood on the platform,
decorated in the blue ribbons of
Humboldt. These colors • were to
remain, or to be displaced by those
of Lodi, according to the verdict
which Professors Newcomer, Whit
tier, and Starbuck should render
on the debate. The subject for dis
cussion was: " Kesolved, That labor
unions are detrimental to the wel
fare of the United States."
Supporting the affirmative the
first speaker was Mr. Cressy, of
Humboldt, who attacked the
method by which labor unions
work, and the results which come
from their policy, lie spoke with
much native force. His work was
careful and showed preparation.
Although he followed a manuscript
he was not unpleasantly tied to it.
Mr. Lilly, who opened the nega
tive for Lodi, was less spontaneous
in his manner. He defended labor
unions on economic grounds as
necessary to maintain the balance
of industries in this country.
Mr. Forsythe, the second affirm
ative for the San Francisco school,
made an excellent impression with
an energetic conversational delivery
and a pleasing voice. His argu
ment was good, in support of the
difficult position that unions are
oligarchic in their nature, and that
their strength is misdirected. He
became nervous as he proceeded
and lost much effect by his hesita
tion.
Joseph Priestly, second negative
for Lodi, argued from the educa
tional value of the labor unions,
not only in their literature issued
but in the fact that they secured
for workmen leisure and money for
self-improvement. A neat turn
was the suggestion that unions
made it possible for workmen to at
tend night school and enjoy libra
ries. Since two of the hoys from
San Francisco are expert machin
ists, and spend their days in the
shop, this placed them in a di
lemma. Priestly had the best
negative speech.
Pressly followed for Humboldt
with the best affirmative speech.
His manner was as good as his de
livery, having organization and ac
cent. He replied directly to the
argument of "education," and said
that the public, taught through the
press, were accomplishing such
work unsugges-ted and influenced
by the unions. He brought figures
to prove that skilled labor was be
ing rewarded at the expense of un

skilled; that union terms dictated
equality of wage, and discouraged
the man of exceptional merit, while
putting a premium on incompe
tency and half-heartedneßS. Profit
sharing was then proposed as the
solution of labor problems. The
very existence of labor unions,
Pressly declared, to be inconsistent
with the notion of profit sharing.
This speaker excelled in his sum
mary, which left little to be desired.
Mr. Gehan, who closed for Lodi
in twenty-seven minutes, was a
favorite with the audience. Al
though lame, Mr. Gehan had a
vigorous and militant bearing on
the stage. He began at once to
obey the loud exhortations of his
schoolmates to "Go at them, Bos
co!" His style was unique, and
adapted to the sharp, almost petty
incisions which he made upon the
case of the infirmative. A succes
sion of minor retorts, threateningly
delivered and emphasized by the
flopping of a page of manuscript,
formed the first half of his speech.
The remainder was devoted to
statistics, proving that while
general wages had fallen in thirty
years, the wages of organized labor
had risen slowly. It was a fault
that he did not make clear his
answer to the claim of the affirma
tive, that this very process was the
unjust result of labor union meth
ods. The negative failed to show
that labor unions were necessary
as a step toward "profit sharing."
Mr. Cressy's rebuttal for the af
firmative was better than his first
speech, dealt directly, and was de
livered with littie hesitation and
genuine natural force.
The lights went out before the
judges rendered a decision. These
had been asked to select the best
speakers for honorable mention.
Pressly of Humboldt was named
as having made the best speech.
One vote was cast for Gehan of
Lodi. It was merely a question of
choice between two styles of speak
ing, for each of these had excelled
in his manner. By a unanimous
vote the debate was decided in
favor of the negative.
It does not mean dissent to say
that the audience did not expect
this decision. Humboldt had ex
celled in those qualities which
appeal to a general audience.
Her speakers showed good prepara
tion, finish, and a forceful conversa
tional manner. Their voices were
incomparably better. The decision
was awarded to the negative team
because of their skill in preventing
the affirmative from fully main
taining a rather difficult position.
Speaking of the contest, Professor
Newcomer, one of the judges, said:
"The decision was given to the
negative for the best array of cogent
arguments least successfully com
bated. Too much, however, cannot
be said in praise of the presentation
and delivery of the affirmative
side—a perfection of form that,
supported also by good matter,
seemed almost to carry the victory,
and that would surely have done
so under lesser disadvantages of a
difficult side. Throughout it was
one of the best conflicts I have ever
had the discomfort of sitting in
judgment upon."
