# NEW SYSTEM.
## Captain Traeger to be Head Coach. Frank Slaker First Assistant. 
### 
Friday evening, at a meeting of
first and second team men, Captain
William 1. Traeger and Frank
Slaker were chosen head football
coach and first assistant, respect
ively, for theseason of 1902-3. The
selection of Traeger to act as cap
tain and head coach marks a new
era in Stanford athletics. The
same plan has been pursued at
Cornell for several years and has
met with much success.
Captain Traeger explained to the
men several plans,of coaching that
bad been suggested for next year,
and on the motion of retiring-cap
tain R. S. Fisher to make Traeger
both captain and head coach for
next year, the men voted unani
mously in favor of it. Traeger is
to have entire charge of all the
football men, and his lirst assistant
will be Frank Slaker. Slaker's rep
utation as a football player is well
known. Prior to coming to Stan
ford he played two years as full
back on the University of Chicago
eleven, and was given a place on
the All-American team by Walter
Camp. Slaker looked after the
Stanford men while they were at
Pasadena training for the game
with Michigan, and to him a good
deal of credit is due for the strong
tight they got up against Yost's
powerful team. Slaker will supply
the experience Eastern coaches
ha ve hitherto given Stanford, as he
is well acquainted with the Eastern
style <Â»112 playing.
In genera I, 'Integer's new system
of coaching embraces the plans
followed by Coach Yost, of Michi
gan, and Burr Chamberlain, of
Yale, Stanford's coach in 1899.
Yost believed in perfecting team
work, while Chamberlain was an
advocate of individual develop
ment. Both plans will be given
the greatest attention. The first
few weeks will be given up to in
dividual training; and each coach
will be placed in charge of a squad
of men.
The appointment of Traeger and
Slaker does not mean that the team
is to be without the coaching and
advice of the men who have always
given their time during the past
seasons, for Captain Traeger ex
pects to have the aid of many
alumni and members of the fac
ulty, including Professors Lewers,
Searles and others.
