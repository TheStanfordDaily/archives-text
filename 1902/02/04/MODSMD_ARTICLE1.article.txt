# MUSEUM CHANGES.
## Description of the Exhibits Added and Improvements Made Recently. 
### 
With the reopening of the Mu
seum yesterday to students and,
visitors, a decided improvement;
was found in the arrangement of
exhibits, and nearly all the changes
made since the building was closed
seem to be an advantage.
The Natural History exhibits
which formerly occupied the ex
treme room of the north art gal
lery have been placed in the upper
rooms of the south annex, and are
arranged in a much more systemat
ic and striking order. The Egyp
tian collection has been taken from
the room adjoining the Cesnola
collection of pottery and placed on
the lower floor of the north wing.
The whole of the second floor on
the north side of the vestibule will
he made into an art gallery in
which the pictures that arrived last
spring, and many others, will be
hung. This part of the Museum
will be closed for some time, as the
paintings which were taken down
to be oiled and to have their frames
polished and gilded are not yet
ready for rehanging. Some change
has also been made in the arrange
ments of the articles in the Chinese
room.
The annexes are repainted and
calcimined. The cases, with the
exception of those in the Egyptian
room, have been opened and the
maroon-felt backing has been re
moved and a buff-colored oilcloth,
especially prepared for the purpose,
substituted. With this colored
backing the exhibits show up much
better than formerly. Varnish,
paint, and sandpaper have been
used freely. The Egyptian cases
are distinctly different from the
other cases in the building, both in
arrangement and style. They
have been lined with a beautiful
tint of deep English vermilion oil
cloth, the most expensive lining
ever used on a Museum case.
The first of six mirror cases de
signed for the Egyptian department
arrived at the Museum a few days
ago, and has been set up. It is a
benutiful and unexcelled piece of
workmanship. While in Europe
Mrs. Stanford examined the four
cases in the Louvre which contain
Baron Rothchild's celebrated
Egyptian collection, and immedi
ately on her arrival in San Fran
cisco she gave specifications for the
construction of six cases which in
many respects eclipse those of Both
child. They are seven feet long,
four feet wide, and six feet deep,
and are of plate glass. They are
fitted with polished French art
mirror shelves, ground and fitted
in pyramid style, five deep, giving
the appearance of a solid polished
surface of silver. By the aid of
the mirror backing tlie spectator
will be enabled to look upon the
object exhibited from both sides
at once. The work upon this case,
and upon those which will later be
placed in t he Museum, was done
by the most expert cabinet and
glass makers on the coast, Mr.
Bautnan having charge of the case
and Fuller & Co. of the glass. A
great deal of interest was aroused

in San Francisco by the exhibit of
the ease, while it was being put to
gether and afterwards, especially
among cabinet builders, glass
workers, and those interested in
museums and exhibits. These
cases will be filled with the very
choicest articles of Egyptian an
tiquity, and will hereafter he a
striking feature of the Museum.
King Chafra now occupies the
rotunda of the Egyptian room, and
his place of honor in the center of
the vestibule is taken by a large
Oriental alabaster vase, as attrac
tive an article of its kind as is now
in the Musuem. It was purchased
in Europe by Mrs. Stanford and
arrived at the Museum last spring
hut was not unpacked until re
cently. It has been placed upon a
beautiful marble pedestal. The
vase is an Oriental alabaster, and
was hewn out of fragments of the
blocks presented the Khedive of
Egypt for the rebuilding of the cele
brated Basilica of St. Paul's, outside
the walls of Rome. The artist's
name is unknown by the Museum
curator, and many other facts of
its history, which are at present in
the possession of Mrs. Stanford,
will be placarded in a few months.
The prize was presented to Pope
Gregory XIII, whose relatives in
herited it after his death. The
vase is a magnificent work of art,
the grain of the stone, the execu
tion and finish of the work being
of the highest order. The form
and expression of the serpents
adorning its exterior are especially
remarkable.
The Museum library, owing to
the interest that has sprung up
concerning Egyptain antiquities,
has been supplied with several
very excellent works upon Egyp
tian architecture and symbols. By
far the best of the collection is a.
"Mizraim," of which only 800 copies
are in existence; this was obtained
at considerable expense. The
"Ancient Egypt or Mizraim," as it
is entitled is edited, by Samuel
Augustus Binon and is profusely
illustrated with engravings and
colored plates containing views of
the Temples of Dendera, Karnak,
Hathnr, Philae, Rameses 111, Lux
or, and other temples of old Egypt,
taken by the artists who worked
in connection with L' Expedition
de 1' Egypte, Lepsius, and Prisse
d' Avenues. It was printed by
Henry S. Allen, New York. There
is also a complete set of the "Book
of the Dead, the Chapters of Com
ing Forth by Day," by E. A. Wal
lis Budge of the British Museum,
London, 1898. A number of the
later histories of Egypt are in
cluded.
Work will continue as rapidly as
possible. Many boxes of Egyptian
relics, besides a vast quanity of
other articles, remain yet to be
opened and placed on exhibit.
Curator Peterson is getting things
into presentable shape and the re
opening of a part of the Museum
shows the results of his skill and
svstematic direction.
