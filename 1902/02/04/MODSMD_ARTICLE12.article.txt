Every <>nk will he pleased with
the favorable showing of the Inn
finances for January. Notwith
standing the heavy expense of es
tablishing the enterprise, a small
balance stands at the end of the
first month, and the announcement
is made that, with twenty more
regular boarders, the price to mem
bers may be reduced from $4.00 to
$3.75 per week, or more than $1.00
per month. Members seem well
satisfied both with the food and
service, and these have steadily
improved since the beginning.
Many residents of Encina have
not yet taken advantage of the
convenience offered by the Inn
and yet every additional member
means a pro rata reduction of ex
penses, a more solid basis for the
concern, and continued improve
ment. The venture has already
been more successful than was
anticipated.
