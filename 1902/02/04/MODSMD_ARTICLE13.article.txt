This vvkkk the graduate man
agers of California and Stanford
are to decide finally whether or
not the Intercollegiate Field-day is
to be held on or off the Stanford
campus. With no intention of
meddling in affairs without its
province, and believing that the ex
pression of the best student body
sentiment is the first duty of the
college paper, the Daily Palo
Alto would like, before it is too
late, to state clearly the position of
its constituents in this matter.
That the opposition of the Associ
ated Students would be overwhelm
ing if the question could come be
fore them, is undeniable. The only
reason so far advanced by the ad
vocates of a meet off the campus
is wholly financial. By going
to Tanforan or San Francisco,

it in asserted, the shekels
would fall a little more rapidly
into the University coffers. Hut
this fact is as yet unproven, and
against it is arrayed every other
consideration. In this connection
it must he remembered that, meet
or no meet, the track in the oval
will have to he putin trim, and
that at once; to supply a first-class
trainer with fourth-class apparatus
is worse than folly. Jt is the gen
eral belief that the whole subject
of finances is beside the question;
that the only legitimate consider
ation is whether Stanford's chances
are going to be hampered or helped
by going abroad for a contest.
