# "Chappie" Again.
## 
### 
In the current number of the
Chaparral the editor writes in a
confidential mood. It is no easy
tiling, he Hays, to issue the maga
zine. The editorial board should
represent the college at large, and
ail invitation is given to candidates.
The best feature of the issue is
little Willie's page of caricatures of
"Chappies Bored." The removal
of the ivy seems a productive
source of inspiration to the local
muse. This time it is "The Girl or
the Ivy"â€”a most successful at
tempt. The most notable drawing
is "Songs Without Words, No. 98,"
a full-page production by Ilenaud.
The supply of joshes, too, seems to
bave increased, and their quality is
up to standard.
