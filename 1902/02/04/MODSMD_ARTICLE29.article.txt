# Roosevelt, '03, Gone East.
## 
### 
W. K. Roosevelt, '03, whose in
juries received in the football game
with Michigan on New Year's day
prevented his registering this
semester, left today for his home at
Ackley, Iowa. Fie will return to
Stanford next fall. At Lake For
est University Roosevelt was cap
tain arid pitcher of ,the baseball
team, and his inability to come out
on the diamond this spring removes
one of the most promising candi
dates for the pitcher's position.
