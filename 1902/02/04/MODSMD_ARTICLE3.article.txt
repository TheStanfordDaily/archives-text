# INTERCLASS GAME
## How the Juniors Conquered the Seniors in a Muddy Battle. 
### 
The first battle of the Interclass
baseball series was fought 011 the
campus, yesterday afternoon, be
tween the Seniors and Juniors, and
resulted in an easy victory for the
Juniors with the score 14 to 3.
Battle it was in name, but in reality
it was more of a comedy abounding
in errors. The muddy condition of
the lield prevented any good exhibi
tion of ball, and as a result the en
tire game was played with abandon.
The Juniors, with the Varsity
pitcher, Parker, and four other
Varsity men, proved too hard a
proposition for the Seniors, and
the latter went down to defeat
under a fusilade of base hits and
two-baggers.
The game was the Juniors' from
the very start when McDowell gave
Copp, the first man, his base on
balls. The fun commenced im
mediately, and when the smoke
had cleared away it was found that
the Juniors had piled a total of
four runs, and had live hits to their
credit. They repeated the perform
ance in the second inning, and
closed with five additional runs.
After this the runs were
scattered, but at 110 time of the
game were the Seniors able to break
the Junior charm and pile up more
than two tallies on their side. The
game was marked by an endless
array of errors and had plays, al
though the heavy hitting of tiie
Juniors relieved the monotony to
some extent. Captain Cowden and
student body President McCornnck
were the particular stars of the
Seniors, and the latter proved him
self the pride of the bleachers by
his skilful handling of two long
hard flies in right field.
