# Cause of Conflict.
## 
### 
Unfortunate as the conflict is be
tween the date for the Pirates of
Penzance and the Carnot debate,
there seems to he no possibility of
making any change now. The
management set the time for the
opera when it was understood that
the debate would be on February
7th, and made plans accordingly.
Since then the debate has been
changed to the 14th. The adver
tising is already issued for the en
tertainment, and it is necessary to
make the best of the situation.
