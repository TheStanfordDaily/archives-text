# SOPHOMORES VS. FRESHMEN.
## The
						Two Lower Classes Will Play Baseball Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
Tlio Freshman-Sophomore base
ball game will be called tomorrow
afternoon at 4 o'clock with Swin
dells as umpire. The Freshman
captain, McFarland, has not yet
selected his team, having had but a
day or two in which to examine
the material. He will do the
twirling, and Stillman will catch.
Kehrlein will probably be on first
and Trowbridge on third. P. Tar
pey and Carter will fill other posi
tions on the Held.
For the Sophomores Captain
Tritch will pitch and McGilvray
will be behind the bat; Blake, at
first; Luce, second; Ballagh, third;
Yerington, shortstop; Baker, left
field; Wilson, center field; Shields
and McFadden, right field. Indi
cations point to a Sophomore vic
tory. Tritch and McGilvray in
Saturday's game worked well to
gether, while the whole infield is
composed of good second-team men.
They should he stronger in team
work also, since the Freshmen failed
to organize in time to prepare for
the contest as they should have
done.
The successful team tomorrow
will play the Juniors for the class
championship, but the date for
this contest is not yet set.
