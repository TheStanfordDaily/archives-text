At a meeting of the Sophomore
Cotillion Committee this afternoon
it was decided to hold the class
dance on the 2'2d of February.
There will be sixteen regular dances,
four extras, and one "naughty-four
grab." The supper dances will be
the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth.
Prizes are offered for the best pro
grain design, and competition
will be closed next Friday.
