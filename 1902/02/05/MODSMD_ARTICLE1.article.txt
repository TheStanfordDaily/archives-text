# TRAINING ON THE TURF.
## Track Men Making Progress Despite the Weather. Fifty-two Candidates in Harness. 
### 
While awaiting the arrival of
the cinders the track men have
been working on the turf. The
number of men on the list is in
creasing, seven or eight new men
having come out within the last ten
days. A review of the names
entered in the different events
should produce several results
among Stanford students. It ought
first to show a degree of confidence
in Trainer Moulton which has been
aroused by his enthusiastic and
conscientious work. Every man
feels that Moulton knows his busi
ness and is determined to work for
whatever there is in it. He is a
man that is never beaten until the
last shot is fired and the last string
broken. The scarcity of men in
some of the events should encour
age every man with any ability at
all to get out and make a try for
the team; for it is conceded that a
place on the track team of 1902
will he an honor worth having and
worth working for. There is also
plenty of room for men to win
points in the class field-day. No
class at the present time has a
"cinch" on that contest, in the
two-mile race, the hurdles, the
jumps, and in the weights places
are open to point-winners in both
the Intercollegiate and the class
meets.
In the athletic agreement of last
January the two-mile race and a
mile relay race were added to the
events, the mile walk being struck
out. Good judges of athletics have
held that no man in the State can
beat Zschokke out in the two-mile
race if he will enter it. Zschokke
is as yet undecided, but is certainly
needed in the event.
Relay races have, as a general
rule, been novelties in California
track meets. Stanford's chances
in the event are good. Five points
will be counted on the side of the
winner. According to the agree
ment the relay team will be com
posed of four men when the field
day is held at Stanford, five men if
at Berkeley. In case the field-day
is held at Tanforan or in San Fran
cisco other arrangements may be
made.
Captain McCaughern has written
to George James of the Olympic
Club informing him of the fact
that Stanford will not enter a team
for the cross-country cup to
be competed for on Washing
ton's Birthday. McCaughern has
looked the ground over and has
decided that it would be unadvis
able, as the men have expressed
themselves as opposed to such ac
tion. Trainer Moulton has held
himself in readiness to get the ath
letes into the best, possible shape
in case any should present them
selves for training, but no one
has done so. Both captain and
trainer have recognized the fact
that by allowing a man to enter
they practically sacrificed him for
the remainder of the season. More
over, the decision has been left
with the men, and none have
shown a desire to compete.
The following list includes most

of the candidates who have ap
peared for practice.

held that no man in the State can
beat Zschokke out in the two-mile
race if he will enter it. Zschokke
is as yet undecided, but is certainly
needed in the event.
Relay races have, as a general
rule, been novelties in California
track meets. Stanford's chances
in the event are good. Five points
will be counted on the side of the
winner. According to the agree
ment the relay team will be com
posed of four men when the field
day is held at Stanford, five men if
at Berkeley. In case the field-day
is held at Tanforan or in San Fran
cisco other arrangements may be
made.
Captain McCaughern has written
to George James of the Olympic
Club informing him of the fact
that Stanford will not enter a team
for the cross-country cup to
be competed for on Washing
ton's Birthday. McCaughern has
looked the ground over and has
decided that it would be unadvis
able, as the men have expressed
themselves as opposed to such ac
tion. Trainer Moulton has held
himself in readiness to get the ath
letes into the best, possible shape
in case any should present them
selves for training, but no one
has done so. Both captain and
trainer have recognized the fact
that by allowing a man to enter
they practically sacrificed him for
the remainder of the season. More
over, the decision has been left
with the men, and none have
shown a desire to compete.
