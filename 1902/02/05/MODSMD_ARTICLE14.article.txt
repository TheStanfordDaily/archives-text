If Stanford is able to schedule
a football game with Michigan for
next Thanksgiving day, it is an op
portunity not to be lost. We have
been made to realize the import
ance of securing more contests, and
scarcely any other would be as prof
itable as one with the team that
overwhelmed us on last New Year's.
We must learn to play football as
they do in the East, and the best
way to learn this is by meeting
the strongest elevens available. A
Stanford-Michigan Thanksgiving
game in San Francisco would
draw immense crowds. Now is the
time to begin negotiations.

In coming years one of the fond
est memories of Stanford alumni
will be that of the hells sounding
in beautiful harmony from the
church tower every fifteen minutes
throughout the day. We who are
here have heard them ring for the
first time, and have today wit
nessed the beginning of a custom to
continue, no doubt, while the Uni
versity stands. For the under
graduate, the bells will be a con
stant inspiration; and for the
alumnus, the ringing of chimes,
wherever he may be, will thrill him
with recollections and associations
from the campus of his alma
mater.
