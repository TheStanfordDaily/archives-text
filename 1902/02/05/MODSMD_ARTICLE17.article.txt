The Colorado School of Mines, at
Golden, Colo., where Ed. Oilman,
'01, is now doing work, is closed,
awaiting the outcome of a hitter
light between the president of the
institution, the faculty, and the
student body. A short time ago
seven students were dismissed for
throwing crucibles around the lab
oratory. All the students threat
ened to bolt in a body unless these
men were allowed to come back, so
the president of the college, Regis
<le Cheuvenet, reinstated them.
The faculty immediately resigned,
because of the action of the presi
dent. A petition has been sent to
the state board of regents, which
has control of the college, request
ing that the president he dismissed,
and if this is done the present fac
ulty will remain, lint liegis de
Cheuvenet is said to have such po
litical power that the board will
hardly dare dismiss him. The
school is nearly deserted now, and
unless the matter is adjusted at
once it will not resume work this
semester.
