# HANDBALL MEET.
## The 						Intercollegiate Committee Will Consider Definite Arrangements. 
### 
So far as the executive commit
tees of both universities are con
cerned, the Intercollegiate handball
tournament is now a certainty, as
the Stanford committee acted favor
ably last night. It only remains
for the Intercollegiate Athletic
Committee to make final definite
arrangements as to rules, date, and
place of meeting. This will proba
bly be done the last of this week.
