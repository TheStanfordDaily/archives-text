Miss Mevitt, an expert on dis
eases of the eye and ear, gave a
very interesting talk before the Ed
ucation classes this morning. She
has a system of correcting and de
veloping the vocal organs, by means
of which she has accomplished
many astonishing cures. Her sys
tem is, in general: First, gymnastic
and articulate exercises of organs

of Bound; second, gymnastic and
silent oral exercises; and third,,
great care that exercises do not i
tire. To have and retain a good
voice and hearing, one should !
never wear a stiff, high collar. An 1
erect carriage is of the greatest iin - j
porta nee.
Miss Mevitt gave many instances
of her experiences in this country, '
in Canada, and in Japan. Her
work has been, a great deal, among
deaf mutes.
The exercises which she pre
scribes are of greatest aid to people
with no pronounced defect, as well
as to those who are more seriously
affected.
