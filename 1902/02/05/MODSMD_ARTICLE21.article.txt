Can you give me a little of your
space to make a comment upon a
practice that is getting to be ver\'
common and very annoying. 1
refer to the custom which some
young gentlemen have of stealing
refreshments, especially from the
sorority houses, when everyone is
in the front room receiving guests.
It would be very much pleasanter
if all the gentlemen came to the
front door in the regular way.
Sometimes a great deal of annoy
ance and embarrassment lnis been
caused, not only because refresh
ments have been carried away, but
because plates and freezers were
not returned. I believe that this
sort of raiding ought to be stopped,
or at least carried on with more
consideration to the hostesses. M.
