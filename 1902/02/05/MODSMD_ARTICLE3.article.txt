# Tennis Manager Appointed
## 
### 
Treasurer Edwards has appointed
T. E. Stephenson, '03, to act as
tennis manager for the remainder
of the season. The policy of the
manager in the past will probably
be followed during the present se
mester, but a larger number of
tournaments will be held than
usual. At least one in every two
weeks will be arranged, and if pos
sible they will be more frequent.
A fee of fifty cents will be charged
all those who enter, in order to
cover the cost of the balls which
will go to the winners, probably
two-thirds to the first man and
one-third to the second man. The
next tournament will be held on
Saturday, February 15th.
