## Professor Rolfe Gave a Most Entertaining Lecture Last Evening. 
### 
Students who did not attend
Professor Rolfe's lecture on Oxford
last evening missed a delightful en
tertainment. More than twenty
views of the famous university
town and of the different colleges
were thrown on the screen, and
each one gave the speaker oppor
tunity to relate in a most engaging
style some historic association or
modern custom. The audience was
impressed with the beauty of Ox
ford, and surely no one came away
without wishing to visit the scenes
so well illustrated and described.
The lecture did not treat of the
place particularly as an educational
center, hut related rather to the sur
roundings. There were pictures of
the town with its buildings, towers,
and spires in the background; of
High street, known simply as the
High, which is one of the linest
streets in Europe; of St. Mary's, of
Christ's church, and of several
college buildings, halls, and quad
rangles. Although Cambridge ex
cels in beautiful individual build
ings, Professor Rolfe said that the
charm of the entire surroundings,
and the many inviting spots at Ox
ford, made it altogether the more
attractive to him. In speaking of
names and terms peculiar to the
community he observed that, with
the exception of some unique ex
pressions, the speech cultivated
there is strikingly pure, bright, and
epigra mmatical, thus accounting
for the finish of English newspaper
writing, much of which is done by
Oxford graduates.
In front of St. Mary's church,
one of the oldest buildings, where
many prominent incidents of his
tory have occured, is the scene of
the famous "town and gown" fight
every September. In the past this
conflict between students and towns
men was a serious affair, often re
sulting in the loss of several lives,
but now it has come to be little
more than a rush between the two
factions.
Without the views themselves,
and the accompanying comments
and anecdotes of the speaker, it is
impossible to convey an idea of the
lecture. One striking feature of
nearly all the scenes represented
was the clinging vines on every
tower and building and in every
corner of the quadrangles which
softened the barrenness of the stone
walls and gave an indescribable
charm to the pictures.
Among the views shown were
the town of Oxford, High street
and St. Mary's, Magdalen Bridge,
Magdalen Quad, St. Mary's, Trin
ity School, Exeter Gardens, Balliol
Quad and Library, St. John's street
Front, St. John's Garden Front, St.
John's Garden, New College Quad,
New College Chapel, Oriel Quad,
Oriel Hall, Christ Church Front,
Christ Church Quad, Christ Church
Staircase, Christ Church Hall, and
Boat Racing. One of the most in
teresting of these pictures was that
of a boat race on the Thames. At
the close of each year the colleges
contest on the river,which is too nar
row there for to row boats abreast,

! in what is called the humping race.
I The boat winning the series the
! year before takes the lead, and
| whenever the one behind overlaps,
ior humps, it is counted as a
"hump." These races occasion
great enthusiasm among the stu-
I dents.
