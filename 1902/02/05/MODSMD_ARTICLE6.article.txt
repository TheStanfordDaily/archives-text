# THE 						BELLS RING.
## Hereafter They Will Sound the Westminster Chimes Every Quarter-Hour. 
### 
The Memorial Church bells have
been keyed up to the proper pitch,
and will hereafter ring the West
minster chimes every quarter-hour,
going over them once the first
quarter, twice the second, and three
times at the third quarter, and at
the hour they will ring four times,
followed ten seconds later by the
striking of the hour.
The clock is the finest huilt and
best operated machine on the
Coast, and has many new features.
There fire two silencing devices,
which make it possible to shut off
both the chimes and the striking
hammer, so that they may be made
silent at any time.
As soon as it can be done, the
electric lights will lie put up in the
tower. These will be turned on
and off by a device on the clock
which is self-regulating and adapt
ed to the varying lengths of the
night in the different seasons.
The work of regulating the ma
chinery of the clock is in charge of
F. H. McConnell of San Francisco.
When this is finished the works
will be enclosed in a glass case.
