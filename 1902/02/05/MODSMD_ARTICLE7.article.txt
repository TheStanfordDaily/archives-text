The general choir rehearsed
yesterday in the Assembly Hall
under the direction of Mr. Scott-
Brook. Twenty students were
present. Only those whose musical
abilities are above the average are
allowed to take part, in order that
a high standard may be kept up in
the choir. The anthems that were
sung were: "Fear Not, 0 Lord,"
by Gobs; "Incline Thine Ear,"
Himmell; "I Will Call Upon the
Lord," Mozart. Misses Bird and
Martin sand the duet, "1 Waited
for the Lord." The rehearsal was
pronounced a perfect success.
