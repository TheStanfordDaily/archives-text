# Place Undetermined Yet.
## 
### 
The place of holding the Inter
collegiate field-day, which occurs
on Saturday, April 19th, has not
yet been determined, but a decision
will probably be reached within a
few days. The feeling among many
of the track men seems to be strong
against taking the meet away from
the campus, and the only reason
for making any change is the be
lief of the management that gate
receipts will be larger at Tan for an
or at some other track nearer San
Francisco. California will hold
try-outs on March 29th for posi
tions on its team.
