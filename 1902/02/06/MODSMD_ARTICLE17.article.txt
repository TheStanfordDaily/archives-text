# Review of " Love Sonnets."
## 
### 
The current Bookman contains a
review of "The Love Sonnets of a
Hoodlum," and an excellent
picture of the author, Wallace
Irwin, ex-'OO. The article ends
with the following characterization
of the sonnets: "The sonnet has
been likened to an exquisite thought
so that it cannot hold another drop
without overflow. Mr. Irwin's son
nets are, we presume, more like
schooners of steam beer, and we
must not complain if a few bub
bles burst over the edge."
Says the entertaining reviewer:
"Slang, which during the last de
cade has grown so enormously in
vogue, has at last readied the pure
ly lyric development in this sonnet
cycle, which is an audacious parody
of George Meredith's "Modern
Love." While Mr. lieorge Ade has
confined himself to the didactic
vein, Mr. Irwin's vagabond muse
has taken up the lyre and has
twanged it to a rag-time ac
companiment. The vivid tropes
of modern slang are paraphrased,
intensified, and involuted to such
an extent that it required a close
reading study to troll the literal
meaning ; no one but a district
messenger boy, or a Browning stu
dent, can hope to understand every
line.
"Mr. Wallace Irwin was born in
Oneida, New York, in 1875, and
but for a characteristic conflict with
the faculty of the Leland Stanford
Junior University,would have grad
uated at that institution with the
class of l l J00."
