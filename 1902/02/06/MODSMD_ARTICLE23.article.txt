Many visitors who have never
Been the University will come here
if the Intercollegiate Field-day is
held on the campus. This is a
consideration of no little import
ance that should enter into the
determination of the place for the
event. California students would
take the opportunity to visit Stan
ford and, in all probability, as
many if not more of them would
come here than would go to Tan
foran. It is certain that practical
ly our entire student body can be
counted on for a meet at the oval,
whereas only a portion would go
away. In former seasons, when
the event took place in San Fran
cisco, the crowds of city people, on
whom the management relies for
increased gate receipts this year,
never attended. There is no reason
to suppose that they will turn out
in any larger numbers now. When
the lield-day was held here two
years ago, the gross receipts ex

ceeded those of the last meet at the
Olympic grounds.
If any conclusion can be drawn
from the experience, it is that no
financial gain will be made by
taking the meet away from the
campus. Upon the other hand,
there is every reason to believe that
it would mean a loss. The expense
of renting grounds will be consid
erable; the only expense here will
be whatever is incurred by moving
bleachers from the baseball dia
mond; a small item, as this track
must, under any circumstances, be
putin first-class shape for the men
who are training. The attendance
here would, almost without doubt,
be larger, the expense less. Men
will not have to be taken to a
strange track, and California run
ners will be at no more disadvant
age than at any other place away
from their own campus. Our men
themselves prefer to stay here.
Some of them object seriously to
any change being made. Even if
there were assurances that it w< uld
mean financial gain to go to Tan
foran or to San Francisco, this
should not override other considera
tions. However, it is practically
certain that not a cent could be
gained.
