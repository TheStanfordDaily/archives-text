# BIG BASIN PURCHASE.
## Professor Dudley, Member of State Commission, Reviews Status of Project. 
### 
Professor Dudley, head of the
Systematic Botany department,
and a member of the Big Basin
Commission, has given the Daily
Palo Alto an authoritative ac
count of the work of the Commis
sion, and the present status of the
project to purchase the Big Basin.
The following paragraph is re
printed from a recent issue of the
Palo Alto Times:
"An enthusiastic meeting was
held in San Jose last week to urge
the purchase of the Big Basin forest
reserve. Resolutions were adopted
to that end, and a number of elo
quent addresses were made. Among
the speakers was Professor W. R.
Dudley of Stanford, who is a mem
ber of the Commission. He said
that the Commission had not been
idle, but had done a great deal of
work. The territory in the Basin
had been gone over, the owners
seen, and a vast amount of pre
liminary detail looked after. He
felt absolutely certain that the Big
Basin would be purchased, but that
it required time and business meth
ods do all this. That body, of
which he was one, is composed of
capable men of high motive, and
they are acting, he said, for the
people of all the State. Professor
Dudley suggested that the people
of Santa Clara, San Mateo and
Santa Cruz counties do something
direct themselves by building roads
into Big Basin, and seeing that the
supervisors of the three counties be
induced to take hold of this work.
He said that no timber is being cut
on the land which it was proposed
to purchase, though some is being
cut on the Bloom tract, an inferior
body of trees."
When shown the above today,
Professor Dudley said it was sub
stantially a correct statement; but
added that the Bloom tract, of
which much has been said of late,
lies upon the border of the basin
drained by the Waddell Creek. It
has never been included in the
tract which the Commission has
considered most desirable, and pos
sible to acquire for the sum appro
priated, although it contains some
good timber. The great body of
the Basin forest still lies undis
turbed. Furthermore, not only
was the suggestion made for the
three peninsular counties to build
substantial roads to the border of
the proposed park, but the com
mittees suggested to address the
supervisors were actually appoint
ed before the close of the San Jose
meeting, live from each county.
To present this matter was the
sole object of Professor Dudley's
attendance at the meeting, lie
outlined the natural and feasible
routes for such roads, and sug
gested that they be made equal to
the Mt. Hamilton road, or the best
roads over the Swiss Alps, and that
the grade up the mountain he such
that bicycles could be used over
the entire distance. A profitable
industry might be created in San
.lose, Santa Cruz, and other termi
ni of such roads, if comfortable

coaches were ready to convey trav
elers over a fine Santa Cruz moun
tain road to the borders of the pro
posed park. One of the most
charming views in California is
gained by looking down from the
tops of the Santa Cruz mountains
in March and April, upon the
orchards in bloom in the Santa
Clara Valley.
The sum of $250,000 has been
appropriated by the State for two
purposes, one to preserve a fine
body of the most splendidly pro
portioned trees in the world, —an
act proper for the whole State; but
the other purpose: as expressed by
the Governor in his approval of
the bill, was to create a park for
recreation. This, from its situa
tion, would largely be for the bene
fit of the great population of the
San Francisco Bay region. The
Commission strongly felt it was
due the tax-payers in other parts
of the State that some expression
be obtained from the county super
visors of their intention to con
struct roads and thus demonstrate
their willingness, before the park
purchase was made, to pay some
thing extra, in consideration of the
local advantages of a great forest
park.
This project has met with ap
proval from some of the best citi
zens of the three counties, and
there is little question but that
such roads will be built in good
time. Santa Cruz had already
subscribed $5,000 to be expended
on the road toward the Basin.
When asked as to the work of
the Commission, Professor Dudley
said one of the most difficult mat
ters, in this broken, heavily wooded
country, was to lay down the lines
of the proposed park so as to meet
the requirements of the bill, and to
safeguard the interests of the State
completely for a long time to come.
The entire Commission had spent
several days with the advisory
committee in going over the trails
of the Basin: timber experts had
traversed every quarter-section and
made their reports; one of the
Commission had spent an addi
tional week with a surveyor and
two assistants in surveying the
streams to their sources, and this
work had been carefully mapped.
The whole question of water sup
ply and future control of the park
must be carefully weighed, and
titles and boundaries are to be
closely scrutinized.
Most of the desirable land offered
is owned by Mr. H. L. Middleton,
and the continuation of his offer
during the necessary examinations
was an important matter, although
the Commission has a right to con
demn any land in the Basin if it is
necessary. A complete and harmo
nious understanding has existed
between Mr. Middleton and the
Commission that his offer should
continue during these examina
tions. Mr. Middleton's word is as
good as a bond. There is, there
fore, not the slightest reason for the
frantic alarm of a few people over
the fact that a bond, entered into
by a few private citizens in the in
terest of this purchase, had expired.
On account of the above under
standing, and in view of its rights,

the body solely authorized to act in
the purchase has not deemed it ad
visable to renew any bond.
A San Francisco paper has as
serted that the Big Basin lands are
assessed at $5.00 per acre, and a
San Francisco attorney has asserted
that they have risen in market
value to $400.00 per acre. Both of
these statements are probably
shameless displays of carelessness.
The Santa Cruz Surf recently
printed the following, which is sub
stantially correct: "Three-fourths
of the lands (in the Basin) which
the State seeks to purchase are
assessed at $50 per acre, some at
$45, some at $40, and some as low
as $20." Undoubtedly Mr. Mid
dleton, who is regarded as a public
spirited citizen in Santa Cruz
county, asked what he considered a
fair price for the land, in placing
its market value (which is always
much above the assessed value) at
$100 per acre. Mr. Middleton has
acted in a strictly honorable man
ner in this matter, and if the State
does not purchase, he will establish
a small park there himself, near
the Barlow Camp. But it is the
Commission's business to make
such a bargain as it thinks best, or
else condemn the land. The char
acter of the Commission's work in
this direction can he judged
from the personnel of the following
named business men, members of
it or its advisory committee: Ar
thur W. Foster, president of Cali
fornia Northwestern Railway; Win.
H. Mills, for a long time land
agent of the Central Pacific Rail
road; Hervey Lindley, vice-presi
dent and manager of the lumber
company at Klanmthon, Sis
kiyou County; W. W. Van
Arsdale, a half-owner of the
great timber interests at Mc-
Cloud; Robert Dollar, formerly a
redwood lumberman; and General
N. P. Chipman, president of the
State Board of Trade. All the mem
bers serve without compensation.

printed from a recent issue of the
Palo Alto Times:
"An enthusiastic meeting was
held in San Jose last week to urge
the purchase of the Big Basin forest
reserve. Resolutions were adopted
to that end, and a number of elo
quent addresses were made. Among
the speakers was Professor W. R.
Dudley of Stanford, who is a mem
ber of the Commission. He said
that the Commission had not been
idle, but had done a great deal of
work. The territory in the Basin
had been gone over, the owners
seen, and a vast amount of pre
liminary detail looked after. He
felt absolutely certain that the Big
Basin would be purchased, but that
it required time and business meth
ods do all this. That body, of
which he was one, is composed of
capable men of high motive, and
they are acting, he said, for the
people of all the State. Professor
Dudley suggested that the people
of Santa Clara, San Mateo and
Santa Cruz counties do something
direct themselves by building roads
into Big Basin, and seeing that the
supervisors of the three counties be
induced to take hold of this work.
He said that no timber is being cut
on the land which it was proposed
to purchase, though some is being
cut on the Bloom tract, an inferior
body of trees."
When shown the above today,
Professor Dudley said it was sub
stantially a correct statement; but
added that the Bloom tract, of
which much has been said of late,
lies upon the border of the basin
drained by the Waddell Creek. It
has never been included in the
tract which the Commission has
considered most desirable, and pos
sible to acquire for the sum appro
priated, although it contains some
good timber. The great body of
the Basin forest still lies undis
turbed. Furthermore, not only
was the suggestion made for the
three peninsular counties to build
substantial roads to the border of
the proposed park, but the com
mittees suggested to address the
supervisors were actually appoint
ed before the close of the San Jose
meeting, live from each county.
To present this matter was the
sole object of Professor Dudley's
attendance at the meeting, lie
outlined the natural and feasible
routes for such roads, and sug
gested that they be made equal to
the Mt. Hamilton road, or the best
roads over the Swiss Alps, and that
the grade up the mountain he such
that bicycles could be used over
the entire distance. A profitable
industry might be created in San
.lose, Santa Cruz, and other termi
ni of such roads, if comfortable

coaches were ready to convey trav
elers over a fine Santa Cruz moun
tain road to the borders of the pro
posed park. One of the most
charming views in California is
gained by looking down from the
tops of the Santa Cruz mountains
in March and April, upon the
orchards in bloom in the Santa
Clara Valley.
The sum of $250,000 has been
appropriated by the State for two
purposes, one to preserve a fine
body of the most splendidly pro
portioned trees in the world, —an
act proper for the whole State; but
the other purpose: as expressed by
the Governor in his approval of
the bill, was to create a park for
recreation. This, from its situa
tion, would largely be for the bene
fit of the great population of the
San Francisco Bay region. The
Commission strongly felt it was
due the tax-payers in other parts
of the State that some expression
be obtained from the county super
visors of their intention to con
struct roads and thus demonstrate
their willingness, before the park
purchase was made, to pay some
thing extra, in consideration of the
local advantages of a great forest
park.
This project has met with ap
proval from some of the best citi
zens of the three counties, and
there is little question but that
such roads will be built in good
time. Santa Cruz had already
subscribed $5,000 to be expended
on the road toward the Basin.
When asked as to the work of
the Commission, Professor Dudley
said one of the most difficult mat
ters, in this broken, heavily wooded
country, was to lay down the lines
of the proposed park so as to meet
the requirements of the bill, and to
safeguard the interests of the State
completely for a long time to come.
The entire Commission had spent
several days with the advisory
committee in going over the trails
of the Basin: timber experts had
traversed every quarter-section and
made their reports; one of the
Commission had spent an addi
tional week with a surveyor and
two assistants in surveying the
streams to their sources, and this
work had been carefully mapped.
The whole question of water sup
ply and future control of the park
must be carefully weighed, and
titles and boundaries are to be
closely scrutinized.
Most of the desirable land offered
is owned by Mr. H. L. Middleton,
and the continuation of his offer
during the necessary examinations
was an important matter, although
the Commission has a right to con
demn any land in the Basin if it is
necessary. A complete and harmo
nious understanding has existed
between Mr. Middleton and the
Commission that his offer should
continue during these examina
tions. Mr. Middleton's word is as
good as a bond. There is, there
fore, not the slightest reason for the
frantic alarm of a few people over
the fact that a bond, entered into
by a few private citizens in the in
terest of this purchase, had expired.
On account of the above under
standing, and in view of its rights,

the body solely authorized to act in
the purchase has not deemed it ad
visable to renew any bond.
A San Francisco paper has as
serted that the Big Basin lands are
assessed at $5.00 per acre, and a
San Francisco attorney has asserted
that they have risen in market
value to $400.00 per acre. Both of
these statements are probably
shameless displays of carelessness.
The Santa Cruz Surf recently
printed the following, which is sub
stantially correct: "Three-fourths
of the lands (in the Basin) which
the State seeks to purchase are
assessed at $50 per acre, some at
$45, some at $40, and some as low
as $20." Undoubtedly Mr. Mid
dleton, who is regarded as a public
spirited citizen in Santa Cruz
county, asked what he considered a
fair price for the land, in placing
its market value (which is always
much above the assessed value) at
$100 per acre. Mr. Middleton has
acted in a strictly honorable man
ner in this matter, and if the State
does not purchase, he will establish
a small park there himself, near
the Barlow Camp. But it is the
Commission's business to make
such a bargain as it thinks best, or
else condemn the land. The char
acter of the Commission's work in
this direction can he judged
from the personnel of the following
named business men, members of
it or its advisory committee: Ar
thur W. Foster, president of Cali
fornia Northwestern Railway; Win.
H. Mills, for a long time land
agent of the Central Pacific Rail
road; Hervey Lindley, vice-presi
dent and manager of the lumber
company at Klanmthon, Sis
kiyou County; W. W. Van
Arsdale, a half-owner of the
great timber interests at Mc-
Cloud; Robert Dollar, formerly a
redwood lumberman; and General
N. P. Chipman, president of the
State Board of Trade. All the mem
bers serve without compensation.
Professor Dudley, head of the
Systematic Botany department,
and a member of the Big Basin
Commission, has given the Daily
Palo Alto an authoritative ac
count of the work of the Commis
sion, and the present status of the
project to purchase the Big Basin.
