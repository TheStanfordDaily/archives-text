For the first time in a number
of years Stanford won the Carnot
medal last February. Our repre
sentatives who will try for it again
next Friday night are doing their
utmost in preparing for the debate
spurred on by a desire to repeat
the success of hist year.
The average student, however,
seems to lose sight of the fact that
this is the first intercollegiate con
test of the semester, and only real
izes its importance after we have
won or lost. It is necessary as an
evidence of University spirit, as
well as to encourage our represen
tatives, that a large crowd go to
Berkeley on the fourteenth.
