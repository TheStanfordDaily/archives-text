Much interest is being shown in
the approaching western tour of
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,
which will appear at the University
on February 27th. On but very
few occasions has any organiza
tion visited the Coast which
has earned the reputation that
attends the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra, for it is acknowledged
to be among the first musical organ
izations of its kind in the United
States. In the Orchestra are fifty
one people, including the leader,

Adolph Rosenbecker, the soprano
soloist Mine. Ragna Linne, Ed
ward C. Towne tenor, Jan van
Oordt concert violinist, and Franz
Wagner cellist. Each of these
stands at the front of his or her
particular line of work. The Chi
cago, Illinois, Musical Leader says
of the Orchestra:
"To the honor of the Orchestra
let it be said that Adolph llosen
becker is such an all-round musi
cian that he can conduct with the
same finished effect a score of Schu
bert's Unfinished Symphony or a
Strauss Valse. As an accompanist
Rosenbecker has shown himself un
surpassed. When Carreno, after
her triumph at Galesburg, was be
ing vociferously applauded, she
twice brought Rosenbecker to ac
knowledge the applause. Speaking
after the concert Mine. Carreno
said: 'Mr. Rosenbecker's accom
paniment was splendid; the suc
cess was as much due to him as to
anything else. 1 am delighted with
the Orchestra. It was one of the
best accompaniments I have ever
had.' "
