# A 						GOOD GAME.
## Freshmen Will Play Juniors Monday for the Class Championship. 
### 
Flaring across the top of the
tickets to yesterday's willow battle
were these words in bold black
type: "Second Class Game.'' The
prediction may have had some
foundation in the experience of
other years, but in this case the
prophet was without honor. It was
a first-class game —as pretty base
ball as any one would come to see
any place. Surprise followed
quickly by great glee was the way
it hit the bleachers. Seldom has
there been such a good class contest.
And the Freshmen won. The
class championship now lies be
tween 1903 and 1905, who will play
next Monday afternoon. The two
intervening classes have been laid
carefully away on the little plush
shelf where they put the has-beens.
Hut it took more of an effort for
the Infants to conduct 1904 to the
rear than it did for the Plugs to lay
low the Sombreros on bloody Mon
day. The score yesterday was six
to three —and the six were wrapped
up neatly by the Freshmen.

It was a good game —the kind of
a game that keeps shivering fans
on the bleachers, when the wind
cuts big blary holes in the enthusi
asm; and the wonder of it was that
they could play any ball, for it
wasn't national game weather, as
any one who might, perchance,
have had a thermometer, can
testify. It was cuttingly cold;
quite unusual weather for careful,
scrupulous handling of a horse
hide sphere.
The truth of it was that it was a
pitchers' battle. McFarland for
the Freshmen and Triteh for the

Sophomores were responsible, large
ly, for the limited supply of tallies,
though their support was invariably I
of a high class order. They are
both candidates for the job on the
Varsity, and if their slab work of
yesterday is any criterion the out
come is doubtful —this much being
certain, that the Varsity is assured
of a good man. McFarland had a
little the better of it yesterday,
holding the Sophs down to three
hits, while the Freshmen un
raveled Tritch's mysteries for six
safe ones. McGilvray and Still
man held down the reception ends
and did it well, McGilvray having
just a shade the better of the argu
ment. On the initial sack, both j
lilake and Kebrlein were there —
but why go on? It was a pitchers'
battle in which the support had
much to do with the result. That's
not a paradox, either; it's an epi-;
gramtnatic summing up of one of j
the best games ever played by any
two classes.

the contest, considering that it was j
much pleasanter indoors. At the
close of the game there was the

ball. No casualties were reported, j

much to do with the result. That's

Flaring across the top of the
tickets to yesterday's willow battle
were these words in bold black
type: "Second Class Game.'' The
prediction may have had some
foundation in the experience of
other years, but in this case the
prophet was without honor. It was
a first-class game —as pretty base
ball as any one would come to see
any place. Surprise followed
quickly by great glee was the way
it hit the bleachers. Seldom has
there been such a good class contest.
And the Freshmen won. The
class championship now lies be
tween 1903 and 1905, who will play
next Monday afternoon. The two
intervening classes have been laid
carefully away on the little plush
shelf where they put the has-beens.
Hut it took more of an effort for
the Infants to conduct 1904 to the
rear than it did for the Plugs to lay
low the Sombreros on bloody Mon
day. The score yesterday was six
to three —and the six were wrapped
up neatly by the Freshmen.
Here's the score as engineered by

It was a good game —the kind of
a game that keeps shivering fans
on the bleachers, when the wind
cuts big blary holes in the enthusi
asm; and the wonder of it was that
they could play any ball, for it
wasn't national game weather, as
any one who might, perchance,
have had a thermometer, can
testify. It was cuttingly cold;
quite unusual weather for careful,
scrupulous handling of a horse
hide sphere.
The truth of it was that it was a
pitchers' battle. McFarland for
the Freshmen and Triteh for the

Sophomores were responsible, large
ly, for the limited supply of tallies,
though their support was invariably I
of a high class order. They are
both candidates for the job on the
Varsity, and if their slab work of
yesterday is any criterion the out
come is doubtful —this much being
certain, that the Varsity is assured
of a good man. McFarland had a
little the better of it yesterday,
holding the Sophs down to three
hits, while the Freshmen un
raveled Tritch's mysteries for six
safe ones. McGilvray and Still
