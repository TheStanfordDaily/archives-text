# Work on Chemistry Building.
## 
### 
Work on the Chemistry build
ing is being rushed to the utmost
in order to complete it by Septem
ber Ist. The stair builders have
been forced to work on Sunday in
order to get their work finished in
time for the mechanics of other
trades. The wainscot and elec
trical fixtures have yet to be set in
place, the water fixtures are not
completed, and some of the plas
tering is still unfinished.
Steel laths are a feature of the
building, and it is thought that
plaster laid over steel instead of
wood is less liable to crack. The
double sink of the old laboratory
will l>e replaced by a large single
one in the new quarters. The
desks to be placed in the labora
tories will have tops of soapstone,
as that material is proof against
acid, making a marked improve
ment over wood or glass.
