Lectures often lose their interest
to students because classrooms do
not receive sufficient ventilation.
This is especially true early in the
morning, after the room has been
closed all night.
A certain faculty member an
nounced in public the other day
that the two members of the Car
not team who are taking a course
under him will be excused from
work until the contest with Cali
fornia is over. If we may be par
doned for it, we venture to say
that the professor's move is decid
edly in the light direction. It has
been predicted that Stanford will
ultimately grant university credit
to the student making a place on
an intercollegiate team. Our de
baters would hail with joy such a
decree, but meanwhile conces
sions like the above-mentioned are
thoroughly appreciated.
