# "SEAT OF AUTHORITY."
## Professor Howard Discussed Foundation for Religious Interpretation. 
### 
Yesterday morning Professor
Hurt Estes Howard preached in
the chapel on the "Seat of Author
ity in Religion," basing Ins dis
course on the fundamental idea
that all men are religious. In sub
stance he said:
"Whatever any man holds, Chri
stianity or fetishism, it is his stand
ard of faith and belief that is his
religion. Ail faiths have for their
final standards an infallible truth
growing out of a desire to know the
truth, although it may be an at
tempt to shift moral responsibility
from our shoulders to some external
spirit. We are constantly looking
for something to measure our morals
by —a mechanical device or idol to
prostrate ourselves before. This
seeking for seat of authority has
been marked by a blind groping of
the spiritual intuition of man.
"In Christianity the attempt to
find an infallible standard has re
sulted in placing the Beat of author
ity on either church, Bible or reason,
or on all three. But does infalli
bility lie with church, Bible, or
reason? This state has been reached
by overlooking a simple fact —that
within man there lies spiritual in
tuition which cannot be infalli
ble authority. Scores of ideas have
been held for beliefs which are now
theological curios—slight proof for
infallibility of the church. What
ever church in any age has insisted
upon its dogmas has been forced to
withdraw again and again from its
declarations; but it inconsistently
clings to infallibility.
"No truth, therefore, gets into life
that does not partake of the mis
takes of human agency; and yet,
come whence it may, a new truth
once committed to the mind forms
into molds of former standards.
Everywhere in Christendom the di
vine and limited human ideas are
blended. No book was ever written
which has given rise to so many
thoughts, and religions, and sects
as has the Bible; and if the Bible is
infallible it is of little practical
worth except to an infallible inter
preter, which we lack. It isn't the
Bible that is to be given up, but
that infallibility which represents
the Ecclesiastes as written with
the same nobleness as the Psalms.
"While vesting the scriptures
with authority, we must remember
that the source of the Bible is else
where. Revelation of God's will
through the scripture has come
down to us warped by human
passion and tainted by human
prejudices. Man himself is made
the final authority, and not church
or book. lie gets no more than he
brings eyes to see and ears to hear.
The court of ultimate appeal is to
our own spiritual sense through
which we interpret things.
"However much we may insist

upon outside authority in books or j
cooperation, we accord it to the
spiritual sense which each one lias'
for himself. Creeds, confessions,
Bible, even God—l speak with all
reverence —are summoned before
the bar of our own spiritual reason.
This must be so in the very nature
of things. Those who have bene
fited us were 'men whose spirits
spoke in deep silence of their souls,
and told what they heard.'
"Our own religious insight, with
a hunger and thirst for righteous
ness, is the best judge we have.
Jesus always threw man back on
himself, placing him on his own
moral judgment, to use the spirit
of the law instead of the letter.
There is a spiritual sense, J take it,
just as there is a musical sense; and
not all may have it. \Vherever the
soul has spiritual ears to hear God,
God is heard. The Bible is a light
over our heads and under our feet,
but greater is the communion of a
soul passing into the great infinite.
God's truth comes into the world
crooning softly for those who hear
—a love-song for the home-sick."
