## 
### 
Last evening Rev. Charles Ellis
Smith of the Presbyterian church
of Palo Alto delivered a thoughtful
address before the Christian Asso
ciations on "Ideals and Idols," urg
ing the importance of having some
ideal in mind as the object of aspi
ration, and describing all weak
nesses and pet sins as forms of
idolatry.
