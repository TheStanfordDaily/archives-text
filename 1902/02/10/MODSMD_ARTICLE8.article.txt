# New Library.
## 
### 
Rumors have been in circulation
today that a new Library building
is to be erected on the campus
within the near future. Dr. Jor
dan stated this afternoon that
while probably nothing will be
done for some years, it is the inten
tion of the University eventually
to build a large library that will
hold something like 1,000,000 vol
umes. This will be used for stu
dents doingadvaneed work, while the
present Library will be continued
for general reference purposes for
undergraduates. The plan is for
the proposed building to stand east
of the roads leading to University
avenue, in a position correspond
ing to the new Chemistry labora
tories on the west.
