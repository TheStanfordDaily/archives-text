# JUNIORS WIN SUPREMACY.
## Class Baseball Championship Captured Yesterday by 1903.—Game Was Loose and Ragged. 
### 
The class baseball championship
went to 1903 yesterday by a plen
teous score of 12 to 5. Fresh from
their conquest of the Sophomores,
the Infants toddled on to the soggy
diamond with nine white hats on
their belts, only to be plucked by
the Plugs, glory and all. This
ends the series of conflicts for the
class supremacy. For the second
time in three years it has gone to
1903.
Yesterday's game was too easy.
It was thought by some few who
lay claim to intuition in the dis
covery of baseball material, that
the Freshmen were ball-tossers of
no mean ability, and that they
didn't know a balloon ascension
when they saw one. This view
arose as a result of the splendid
stand which 1905 made last week
against the Sophs, playing ad
hesive, team-work baseball for nine
crucial innings. But yesterday,
when so much was expected of the
children, they took a sure-enough
shoot forty miles in the air. In
the meantime the Juniors plugged
out a dozen.
Despite seeming discrepancy in
ability, the contest was exciting
enough to watch, made so by the
frantic sprinting of Juniors span
ning the bags, lest they run over
one another. The coaching along
the sidelines was original, apt, and
witty. There was no big mix-up
following the contest, because there
was no occasion for one. The su
premacy of the Juniors was proved
only too clearly in the game.
Neither was the weather particu
larly obliging, for, although the
rain held off, it was cold enough
for an occassional shiver from the
bleacherites, and a more than oc
casional tinge of the fingers from
those who were wandering afar
from home out in the mud-patch.
Still there was a good crowd at
the game, and much noise.
The Juniors deserved to win, for
they out-pointed the Freshmen in
every line of baseball endeavor.
Hits and errors make runs in a.
baseball game, and in those two
features the first-year men suf
fered.
McFarland, who officiated on the
rubber so capably for the Fresh
men last Thursday, was touched
up for eight hits, and his support
piletl up seven errors, many of them
inexcusable even on a cold day.
On the other hand, Parker held '05
down to four hits, and his support
has but two errors charged against
it.
This is the score:
