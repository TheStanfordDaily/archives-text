With the prospect of ji trip for
the Varsity track team to meet the
universities of Oregon and Wash
ington, of a meet for the winners of
the interclass field-day with l'o
monu College in the South, and of
contests between the Freshmen and
Berkeley High School and Nevada,
and between the Sophomores and
Ukiah, this will he the most active
track season Stanford has known.
It marks the beginning of a policy
to secure frequent meets with a
variety of competitors, a policy
that has long been needed to stim
ulate interest and effort here, and
that must be pursued in order to
give our teams the fullness of their
development. Last season Califor
nia went North, meeting Oregon
and Washington; this year our
rival is planning a tour of the
East. By establishing rivalry on
the track with more institutions,
we shall widen the opportunity for
our men to neach the limit of their
possibilities. Credit is due Cap
tain McCaughern, through whose
efforts the enlarged schedule is
being arranged.
