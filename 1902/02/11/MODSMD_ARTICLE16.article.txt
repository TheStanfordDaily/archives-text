Would it not l)e a good plan to
appoint someone yell lender for the
Oiirnot debate? Stanford's repre
sentation at best will he pitifully
small compared with the great
body of California students, hut by
concentrating what force we do
have we may overcome much of
tliis disadvantage. A good exam
ple of what may be done in the
way of team support against press
ing odds was furnished when the
debate was held here last season.
The little band of Berkeley enthu
siasts were outnumbered about
lifty to one, hut so energetic was
their effort and able their leader
that the U. C. debaters were quite

as well supported as our own. At
the Intercollegiate, later on, Stan
ford was representee! by a large
delegation, but our cheering was
wofully weak, for the simple reason
that a leader had not been pro
vided. Badinage between support
ers of the rival universities has
come to lie a prominent feature of
the debates, and it will be very un
fortunate if Stanford is forced to
confess inability to hold her own
in this direction.
