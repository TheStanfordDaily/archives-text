# REVIEW OF DEBATES.
## Arguments Made by Speakers in the Intercollegiate Preliminaries. 
### 
Herewith in given a review of the
arguments made by speakers in the
Intercollegiate preliminaries last
Friday and Saturday evenings.
The audience was depressingly
small, hut the speeches all showed
careful preparation.
The first question was, "Re
solved, That it is unwise for the
United States to continue to op
pose the extension of foreign con
trol over any territory of the West
ern Hemisphere.'' M. K. McCor
mick, opening for the affirmative,
took the stand that the Monroe
doctrine was not suited to the pres
ent, that it would retard civiliza
tion to exclude Europeans from
South America, and that the pres
ent policy was supported by no
right, and was useless.
J. W. Cameron was the only up
holder of the negative, but he made
an a hie speech and covered a great
deal of ground clearly. He said
that the present policy had long
been followed by success, and that
this was testified to by the flourish
ing conditions in South America;
that the republics would not be
helped, because there would be dis
cord in Europe and opposition on
their part; and that the United
States would be hurt industrially
and politically.
P. Ij. Rourke argued for the
affirmative that by holding to the
Monroe doctrine we relieve the
South American republics of much
responsibility; that we have less
commercial influence with them
than have European countries; and
that the only thing for us to do is
to go on the same footing as Eu
rope.
C. L. Firebaugli, third on the
affirmative, made the three argu
ments that the original ground for
the Monroe doctrine no longer held;
that the question is whether the
United States has ground for con
tinuing the policy; and that the
powers were more anxious to keep
peace if the policy were abolished,
lie said it was for the negative to
show a good reason why it should
continue.
McCormick attempted to refute
the arguments of Cameron in a
three-minute rebuttal.
The next debate on the question,
"Resolved, That the adoption of
the Fifteenth Amendment was un
wise," L. I). Lock wood opened as
first affirmative with better argu
ments than delivery. He declared
that Negro suffrage is bad; that it
causes sectionalism and race preju
dice; that the amendment in ques
tion is a disgrace to the constitu
tion; and that it prevents unified
voting on great matters among
different parts of the country.
W. C. Maloy upheld the nega
tive with four arguments, —first,
that the franchise is right for the

Negro; second, that it has caused
his great development; third, that
it is beneficial to the white man;
and, fourth, that the amendment
was necessary.
A. 0. Hull, on the affirmative,
said that the Negro was unfit for
goverment; Unit his power to vote
meant rule by conscienceless whites;
and that it caused race hostility.
A. (I. Thompson then followed
on the same side. He was logical,
his delivery was good, and it was
noticeable that he cited good au
thority and not too much. He
made the points that the Negro
were and are unfit for voting, and
that the results of giving them
suffrage have not been good.
Lockwood in his rebuttal made
prominent his former points of race
prejudice and incapability for vot
ing, and skillfully pointed out some
fallacies of his opponent.
The third debate was, "Resolved,
That municipalitiesshould own and
operate their own street railways."
C. F. Dittmar opened with his usual
conversational delivery. He is clear
and easy in his manner, and bis
fault is, perhaps, in being too easy.
His main argument was that pri
vate ownership was a corrupting
influence in city government.
11. W. Everett for the negative
made four points, only the first
two being covered fully,—that city
operation of street railways leads
to inefficiency in the service; and
that civil service fails to keep up
the standard of efficiency, and
causes corruption.
J. 11. Page then delivered the
second speech of the affirmative,
one of the best of the preliminaries.
His arguments were, —first, munic
ipal ownership would result in low
fares; second, service would be more
efficient; third, it would result in
decreasingcorruption in city affairs;
fourth, it would increase interest of
people in city affairs.
A. Jones followed with a con
vincing talk. He made the two
statements that private ownership
is advantageous, both morally and
economically, and that public
