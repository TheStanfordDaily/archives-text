# REVIEW OF DEBATES.
## Arguments Made by Speakers in the Intercollegiate Preliminaries. 
### 
Herewith in given a review of the
arguments made by speakers in the
Intercollegiate preliminaries last
Friday and Saturday evenings.
The audience was depressingly
small, hut the speeches all showed
careful preparation.
The first question was, "Re
solved, That it is unwise for the
United States to continue to op
pose the extension of foreign con
trol over any territory of the West
ern Hemisphere.'' M. K. McCor
mick, opening for the affirmative,
took the stand that the Monroe
doctrine was not suited to the pres
ent, that it would retard civiliza
tion to exclude Europeans from
South America, and that the pres
ent policy was supported by no
right, and was useless.
J. W. Cameron was the only up
holder of the negative, but he made
an a hie speech and covered a great
deal of ground clearly. He said
that the present policy had long
been followed by success, and that
this was testified to by the flourish
ing conditions in South America;
that the republics would not be
helped, because there would be dis
cord in Europe and opposition on
their part; and that the United
States would be hurt industrially
and politically.
P. Ij. Rourke argued for the
affirmative that by holding to the
Monroe doctrine we relieve the
South American republics of much
responsibility; that we have less
commercial influence with them
than have European countries; and
that the only thing for us to do is
to go on the same footing as Eu
rope.
C. L. Firebaugli, third on the
affirmative, made the three argu
ments that the original ground for
the Monroe doctrine no longer held;
that the question is whether the
United States has ground for con
tinuing the policy; and that the
powers were more anxious to keep
peace if the policy were abolished,
lie said it was for the negative to
show a good reason why it should
continue.
McCormick attempted to refute
the arguments of Cameron in a
three-minute rebuttal.
The next debate on the question,
"Resolved, That the adoption of
the Fifteenth Amendment was un
wise," L. I). Lock wood opened as
first affirmative with better argu
ments than delivery. He declared
that Negro suffrage is bad; that it
causes sectionalism and race preju
dice; that the amendment in ques
tion is a disgrace to the constitu
tion; and that it prevents unified
voting on great matters among
different parts of the country.
W. C. Maloy upheld the nega
tive with four arguments, —first,
that the franchise is right for the

Negro; second, that it has caused
his great development; third, that
it is beneficial to the white man;
and, fourth, that the amendment
was necessary.
A. 0. Hull, on the affirmative,
said that the Negro was unfit for
goverment; Unit his power to vote
meant rule by conscienceless whites;
and that it caused race hostility.
A. (I. Thompson then followed
on the same side. He was logical,
his delivery was good, and it was
noticeable that he cited good au
thority and not too much. He
made the points that the Negro
were and are unfit for voting, and
that the results of giving them
suffrage have not been good.
Lockwood in his rebuttal made
prominent his former points of race
prejudice and incapability for vot
ing, and skillfully pointed out some
fallacies of his opponent.
The third debate was, "Resolved,
That municipalitiesshould own and
operate their own street railways."
C. F. Dittmar opened with his usual
conversational delivery. He is clear
and easy in his manner, and bis
fault is, perhaps, in being too easy.
His main argument was that pri
vate ownership was a corrupting
influence in city government.
11. W. Everett for the negative
made four points, only the first
two being covered fully,—that city
operation of street railways leads
to inefficiency in the service; and
that civil service fails to keep up
the standard of efficiency, and
causes corruption.
J. 11. Page then delivered the
second speech of the affirmative,
one of the best of the preliminaries.
His arguments were, —first, munic
ipal ownership would result in low
fares; second, service would be more
efficient; third, it would result in
decreasingcorruption in city affairs;
fourth, it would increase interest of
people in city affairs.
A. Jones followed with a con
vincing talk. He made the two
statements that private ownership
is advantageous, both morally and
economically, and that public
ownership would be corrupt. He
then showed that the most logical
solution of the problem was for the
corporation to be on a private basis
with public control.
Dittmar showed considerable
ability for undermining arguments
in his rebuttal.
The question for the first debate
Saturday evening was, "Resolved,
That all executive functions should
be concentrated in the mayor, and
that his appointments should not
require confirmation." As Bacon,
who was scheduled for the first
affirmative, did not appear, R. H.
Kimball opened the discussion. He
argued for centralization of power,
because such a change in city gov
ernment would stamp out corrup
tion in the city administration, be
cause it would elect better men to
the office of mayor, and because it
would unify the executive branch
of municipal government.
J. J. Edwards followed in the ab
sence of Williams. He spent most
of his time in refuting the affirma
tive argument, and this he did
ably, showing command of his sub
ject and ease of manner.
Kimball made a good rebuttal in
which he touched all bis points,
and strengthened some of his
former statements.
The next debate was on the "Can
teen Question." McComish and
Williams were absent, Leistner
opening. He had to contend against
a poor voice, but the strength and
arrangements of his argument de
serve the credit for his making the
finals. He contended that it was
right to abolish the canteen on both
practical and moral grounds.
F. Roehr followed with the con
tention that the abolition of the
canteen has injured health, morals,
and discipline.
C. B. Wintler said that the can
teen caused the drink and debt
habits; and that the canteen was
proven unnecessary.
Leistner gave a three-minute re
buttal.
The sixth debate was, "Resolved,
That the United States should
maintain a system of bounties and
subsidies on the protection of its
merchant marine." Leib was not
present to take his place as first,
and affirmative A. J. Copp opened.
He argued from the following
statements: Industries have de
veloped since the Spanish-Ameri
can war; the United States has
adopted a less exclusive foreign
policy; war with Europe is more
probable than ever before; the
merchant marine goes hand in
hand with the navy.
O. H. Ritter, speaking for the
negative, ended the debates except
for the rebuttal of Copp. He had
four main contentions. First, that
there is no need of subsidies; sec
ond, that subsidies cannot restore
our supremacy if artificial means
are necessary; third, that the pol
icy of the subsidies was bad in
principle.
The judges, Professors Bassett
and Burcham, declared themselves
well pleased with the debates.
