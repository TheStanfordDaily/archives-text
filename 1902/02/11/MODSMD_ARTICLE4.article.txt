## 
### 
The committee on programs for
the Sophomore Cotillion has ac
cepted the design submitted by C.
K. Studley. The front represents
a German stein on which two
crossed pi pes rest, with the class
numerals and yell above them.
The back cover pictures a cherub
with a mandolin, playing before a
sheet of music. The program will
be cut in the shape of the stein.
