# TENNIS SATURDAY.
## Entries Being- Made for the Second Tournament of the Season. 
### 
The second tennis tournament of
the season will be held on next
Saturday morning, for which en
tries, with a deposit of fifty cents,
should be made at once, it will be
another "round-robin," each play
er contesting with every other one
for the best of seven games. Who
ever wins the greatest number of
games will be accorded first place
and two-thirds of the balls used.
One-third of the balls will go to the
winner of second place.
This tournament ought to call
forth better work than last time,
the men having bad two weeks ad
ditional practice. The playing of
Weihe, Leib, Boyle, and Hopper is
such as to warrant a hot fight for
first place, with chances in favor of
Weihe, the only remaining member
of last year's intercollegiate team.
Through the season a number of
tournaments will be held prelimi
nary to the try-outs for positions
on the team which will meet Berke
ley at the California courts in San
Francisco in April.
