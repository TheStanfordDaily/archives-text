# CINDERS ARRIVE.
## Track Work Will Now be Uninterrupted.â€”More Freshmen Needed. 
### 
The hearts of the track men,
trainer, and captain were glad
dened when an engine hacked up
into the campus and left a carload
of cinders this afternoon. Moul
ton's method of training calls for
steady, every-day work, and bad
weather is not allowed to interfere
if it can possibly be avoided. As a
consequence of the rains for the
last two weeks the track has been
unfit for use, and the men have
been doing work on the turf, which
to say the least, is unsatisfactory,
as no judgment can be formed in
regard to distance speed. The cin
ders will be spread tomorrow and
thereafter training will go on unin
terruptedly, rain or shine.
If everything is in readiness, and
next Saturday is a warm day, a
large number of trials will be run,
and a line may be secured on the
improvement which the various
men have made.
The interest in the organization
of class track teams will be greater
from now on to the last of the
season than it hitherto has been at
Stanford, the management having
arranged for field-days which will
call forth greater effort from each
class. Last year the annual trip
of the Freshmen to Reno was
omitted, as was also the meet
with Ukiah High School. This
year the Freshmen will he given
their trip to Reno, and the Ukiah
athletes will be brought to the
campus.
The winners of the Interclass
Field-day on the 28th of next
month will probably he given a
trip to Southern California for a
meet with Pomoma College, who
have always put a strong team on
the track. This will add a zest to
the annual contest.
The Freshmen as yet do not
seem to realize that class organiza
tion in track work is necessary, for
they have put out but a limited
amount of material from which to
draw men for their events. They
are well represented in the sprints,
especially in the hundred and
quarter, McCaughern, Kitching,
Kehrlein, Dole, Stevens, Sevier,
and Hyde having shown up well in
practice. In the pole-vaults and
jump they have several good men
to choose from, hut in the dis
tances, hurdles, and weights they
cannot expect to hold their own
unless they get a lot of new men at
once.
Swinerton is practically the only
Freshman entered in the distances,
but he cannot be expected to do
all the running in the half, the
mile, and the two-mile. Crawford
is throwing the hammer and
putting the shot and Dole is jump
ing the sticks. Three men doing
seven out of thirteen events will
not win many field-days for any
team. There are plenty of good
men who can, by a little urging, he
made to get out and try. In try
ing for their class team they may
develop into good Varsity material.
