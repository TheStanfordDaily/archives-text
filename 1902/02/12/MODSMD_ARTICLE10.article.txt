A beautiful representation in
water colors ami gold of the mo
saic decorations in the apse of the
Memorial Church was this morn
ing received at the Museum, it
arrived from Vickery in San Fran
cisco where it had been sent for
framing immediately after its arri
val on the .campus about two
months ago. The picture meas
ures nine by three feet and is the
work of the mosaic artists, Salviati
and Company, of Venice, who de
signed the tigures in the church,
with the exception of the copy of
the Lord's Supper. The represen
tation is an excellent piece of work
and gives a better idea of the de
signs than can be obtained from a
view of the apse in its present con
struction. Jt will not be hung,
however, for some time.
The north art gallery of the Mu
seum has been tinted and the re
hanging of the pictures was com
menced this morning but the

tion of four pictures in water colors

three are of the Santa Barbara
Mission, views of the front, rear,
and court, while the other is a
copy of the well-known picture of
Fra Junipero Sena, the greatest
of the California padres. These
pictures are well executed and fur
nish an attractive addition to the
department. They have been hung
