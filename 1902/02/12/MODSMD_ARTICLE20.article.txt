New zest will be put into the
track work since the cinders have
arrived. A well-made path and
the enthusiasm inspired by the
efforts of the captain and by thelex
perience and ability of Trainer
Moulton, will produce surprising
results for Stanford this year. In
spite of the wretched facilities and
the unfavorable weather up to this
time, the progress is already un
precedented, for the men have been
training bard. A determination is
in the air to hegin the new era in
our track history for which we have
so long been praying.
While this determination is be
ing shown so admirably by the
men who have already come out, it

must be re-enforced by the moral
support of the student body at
large, and by the addition to the
squad of everyone who is able and
can spare the time to train for
some event. Every year it becomes
necessary to admonish the Fresh
men, especially, to build up their
class team, and the importance of a
strong aggregation being put forth
by 1905 is greater than ever before
because two meets are arranged in
which the class will represent the
University. As shown by the ar
ticle published today, the Fresh
men need more material for dis
tances, hurdles, and weights. New
men do not realize what they may
do until they have been given sys
tematic training, and the Univer
sity as well as the class is concerned
about the strength of the team
brought out by the Freshmen.
