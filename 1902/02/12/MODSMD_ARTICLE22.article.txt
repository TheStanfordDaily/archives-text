# Prize from French President
## 
### 
Athletes of the Olympian games
to be held in Chicago in 1904, says
the Minnesota Daily, will contest
for a prize offered by Emile Lou bet,
president of France. To show his
interest in the coming festival,
Monsieur Loubet has announced
that lie will give a piece of Sevres
porcelain as a prize.
Just what disposition will be
made of the work of art, has, of
course, not been decided upon, but
it probably will be put up for com
petition in one of the principal ath
letic events of the festival, and will
be won in a competition, in which
athletic merit only will count, open
to athletes representing all the
countries of the world.
