### 
In"The Sportsman's View Point"
department of the February Out
iny, Editor Caspar Whitney, lias
some characteristic things to say
about the case of 0. K. Cutts of
Harvard, who bus recently been
declared a professional after hav
ing successfully refuted similar
charges prior to his participation in
the game with Vale. He says:
"The recent disclosures of 0. F.
Cutts' professionalism were start
ling; not so much because he had
successfully concealed his offense,
as that in full knowledge of the
deception to two great universities
he should have wished to do so.
Knowing he had been paid money
for boxing lessons, and that he waH
therefore ineligible to play any
amateur game, he not only pledged
his word falsely to the Harvard
Athletic Committee, but allowed
that Committee to pledge its word
falsely to Vale. It was a pretty

stiff price to pay for the pleasure of
helping Harvard win its most im
portant football game.
"There it is— the curse of the |
frenzy to win—to win, win, win, j
that is hammered into the heads of
our college boys, until there is no j
love of the game for its own sake j
left in them. That is why .1 am
irrevocably opposed to preliminary j
training seasons, to professional)
coaches, and to all the cursed'busi
ness' of college sport, which neu
tralizes its wholesome, strenuous
value, and makes for that madness
of sport, for the sake of winning j
rather than sport, for the thrill of I
the game honorably and vigorously !
contested."
In view of the facts, Mr. Whit
ney has withdrawn Cults from the
AII-American eleven, moving Bun
ker of West Point to his place and
placing (loss of Yale in the hitter's,
position as subtitute.
