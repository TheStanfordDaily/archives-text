# Exhibition of Japanese Painting.
## 
### 
Mr. Shimada has kindly acceded
to our request to give a practical
illustration of the methods of Jap
anese painting. On next Monday,
at 2:15, in the studio, he will paint

before the art students, and an in
vitation to be present is extended
to the public generally. In addi
tion to seeing the method we shall
also enjoy some of its results in the
shape of a number of masterly
pictures and sketches which he will
exhibit. Some of these will be for
sale.
Mr. Shimada is by birth a Japa
nese nobleman. His work delights
by a high order of artistic excel
lence. 1 might say much in its
praise, but compresß it all into the
one final praise of a work of art —
it is very beautiful.
