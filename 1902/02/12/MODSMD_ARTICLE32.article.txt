# Mormon Choir Coming.
## 
### 
Professor Evans Stephens, the
director of the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir, was on the campus yester
day visiting Paul Tarpey, '05.
About a third of the famous Choir
will visit the Coast next month.
Professor Stephens was planning
an extensive concert tour, but was
unable to complete arrangements
for it. A delegation of about 250,
including 150 members of the
Choir, will, however, come to Stan
ford some time in March, and it is
possible that a complimentary con
cert may be arranged in the new
Church or Assembly Hall.
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is
one of the largest and best known
in the country. It comprises 500
voices in all, and sings for the reg
ular Sunday services in the Mor
mon Tabernacle at Salt Lake City.
The Tabernacle seats 15,000 people,
and the organ which accompanies
the choir is next to the largest
in the world. The organist
is F. F. McCellan, a graduate of
the University of Leipsic. The
Choir took second prize in the
World's Fair choir competition, and
has made many concert tours
through the cities between Salt
Lake and Chicago. It was in Cali
fornia about eight years ago.
