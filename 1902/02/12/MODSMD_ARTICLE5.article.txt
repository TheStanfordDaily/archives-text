Walter Handel Thorley, the rep
resentative English organist at the
Paris Exposition and the leading
organist of England, played on the
organ in the Memorial Church to
day at noon. Mr. Thorley and
wife are making a tour of the
United States, and were here for
the day as the guests of Mr. Scott-
Brook. Mr. Thorley speaks in the
highest terms of the organ and was
much pleased with the tone, though
the circumstances were adverse for
appreciation of sound.
Wallace A. Sabin, organist of St.
Luke's church San Francisco, was
with the party and was persuaded
to play. Mr. Sabin was delighted
with the organ but thought that
when the church was completed
the tone would be more fully ap
preciated.
