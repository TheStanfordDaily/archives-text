# Another Railroad Wreck.
## 
### 
A frei-ght train jumped the track
this afternoon at the corner of Al
varado and Lasuen streets, and
barely room enough remains for
the passage of vehicles at the cross
ing. This is the second time with
in the last week that a train has
been derailed on the campus. The
cause of the accident was due to
the poor condition of the rails and
ties, the heavy rains, and the ex
treme weight of the cars. An un
successful effort was made to pull
the cars back on the track.
