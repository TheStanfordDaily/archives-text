## Criticism of Professor King's Reading' of Hamlet Monday Night. 
### 
As Professor King of London,
who gave the recital from Hamlet
Monday evening, comes highly
recommended, an entertainment of
unusual interest was anticipated.
Nor was the audience disappointed.
Attention did not flag at any point.
Yet a criticism based on the efforts
of Monday night would do the
speaker injustice. Anyene who has
heard him before and has felt the
power of his interpretation could
but regret the loss occasioned by
the unfavorable conditions attend
ing this recital. The reader failed
to adjust iiis voice to the hall. A
light tone and rather high pitch
stirred a disagreeable echo which
rendered much of the reading in
audible, especially to those at some
distance from the platform. In en
deavoring to overcome the difficulty
and hold interest, Mr. King in
creased the movement, with the re
sult that the difficulty was in
creased. Not only were many
words entirely missed, hut clear
ness was sacrificed for lack of time
in transition. One could not re
press a feeling, too, that much fine
ness of modulation and saliency of
emphasis were lacking, in conse
quence. Though the dialogue suf
fered, character and situation
stood out with imaginative clear
ness.
The selections chosen were such
as would show the development of
Hamlet's character. And herein
lay the strength of the reading.
The deepening and intensifying of
Hamlet's nature under stress of
confusing discoveries, the constant
strengthening of his purpose, the
clever assuming of an ''antic dispo
sition," were cleverly suggested.
Perhaps the scenes most valuable
and satisfactory as interpretations
were those between Hamlet and
Ophelia and Hamlet and his
mother. In these, the reader cre
ated a vivid dramatic situation in
which characters moved ami spoke
with ease and naturalness.
Among the many excellencies of
Mr. King's reading might he men
tioned the delightful conversa
tional simplicity of his speech, and
an enunciation delicate and accu
rate. There was no rant or stilted
declamatory effort. All was
touched gently. The rendering
was imaginatively suggestive, and
pervading all was an atmosphere
of grace and beauty that marks
the work of an artist and renders
the memory of it a pleasant
thought.
After the recital Dr. and Mrs.
Jordan tendered an informal recep
tion to the faculty of the English
department, in honor of Mr. King.
