For the eighth time, three de
baters from the University of Cali
fornia and three from Stanford
will compete tomorrow evening for
the medal offered by the Baron de
Coubertin, which is awarded to the
best individual speaker. It may
be seen from the table above that
Stanford won the first of these de
bates, and thereafter the victory
went to California for five succes
sive years, until W. A. Morris
broke the spell and again brought
the medal to Stanford. The result
tomorrow is awaited with in
tense interest. The first contest
was held at Stanford, and has
alternated between the two univer
sities each year since, so that four
have occurred here and three at
California. Twice when the debates
were here the Blue and Gold won
the medal. If a Stanford man is
successful tomorrow, it will be the
first time the Cardinal has won a
victory at the home of its rival.
The Stanford debaters, Messrs.
Wagner, Rice, and Jones, have
completed their preparation and
are ready for the contest. In com
pany with J. F. English, '01, they
will leave here on the 3:00 train to
morrow afternoon, going to Cali
fornia hotel in San Francisco,
where they will remain until time
to leave for the 6:30 ferry for
Berkeley. It is urged that the del
egation going from Stanford
arrange to take that boat, so as to
go over with the team; the train
connecting with it will reach
Berkeley about 7:30.
Speaking of the arrangements
being made for the debate, the
Daily Californian said yesterday:
"The debate is to be held in the
Harmon gymnasium at eight
o'clock. The total seating capacity
of the gymnasium is 2,300, out of
which only a few hundred seats
will be reserved. About 150 Stan
ford students are expected to at
tend the debate, and will occupy
a part of the reserved seats, almost
all the rest of the hall being thrown
open to California students. To
effectively handle the crowd and
prevent confusion, a larger number
of ushers has been appointed than
usual."
The question to lie debated is the
same one used in the Carnot finals:
"Resolved, That the President of
the French Republic should be
chosen by direct vote of the peo
ple," and the order of the speakers
will be:
(1) 11. Rothschild, California,
affirmative; (2) 10. W. Rice, Stan
ford, negative; (3; F. B. Wagner,

Stanford, affirmative; (4) F. M.
Allen, California, negative; (5) L.
E. Martin, California, affirmative;
((i) H. C. Jones, Stanford, nega
tive. Each one of these will have
fifteen minutes, which he may di
vide as he pleases, part for his
main speech and the rest for rebut
tal.
The Carnot was from the first
intended to he a test of extempor
aneous debating ability. With
this object in view, the plan, until
this year, was to announce the gen
eral held of study, which must be in
French Politics, one month before
the debate, the specific question
one week before, and to decide by
lot the sides and positions only
forty-eight hours prior to the con
test. This arrangement has always
proved decidedly unsatisfactoy be
cause the representatives of both
the universities each learned four
speeches, an affirmative and a neg
ative opening argument, and two
rebuttal speeches. No one would
trust himself to the moment for in
spiration to make a creditable
showing, and hence the four
speeches were committed, thus
necessitating a tremendous amount
of labor for the sake of deceiving
an audience into the belief that
splendid extemporaneous work
was being listened to.
Two alternatives were proposed
this year for a change in the
scheme. The first, that the ques
tion be given out the night of the
debate, thus compelling the speaker
to talk extemporaneously; this was
abandoned as impracticable, for few
debaters would want to take such
a. responsibility and fewer audi
ences would care to listen to the
character of the arguments which
would result.
The other alternative, which was
chosen, was to announce the definite
subject, with sides and positions of
speakers, three weeks previous to
the debate.
Of necessity Stanford and U. C.
men must be associated with one
another on both si ies of the ques
tion; this year there are one Stan
ford and two California men on the
affirmative, and two Stanford and
one U. C. man on the negative.
E. W. RICE.
