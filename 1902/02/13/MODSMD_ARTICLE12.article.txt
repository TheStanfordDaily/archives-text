Preparation is now complete,
and the debaters of both California
and Stanford, as well as the stu
dents of the institutions, are await
ing the issue of the contest tomor
row evening. Although the honor
of winning can he gained by but
one man, the decision will mean a
victory for the university that he
represents. With the change in
the plan of conducting the debate
this year, by which the subject and
positions are announced weeks he
forehand, we may expect a decided
improvement in the standard of the
speeches. Each man will speak
with more interest and greater
earnestness than when the question
was announced only one week in
advance and the debaters were not
assigned their positions until two
days before they had to appear on
the platform. The members of our
team have been working with all
the power at their command, and
if the Californians are as well pre

pared the debate will be one of the
ablest and most closely contested
ever seen between Stanford and
California. Our men have won
honor by their effort not only to
satisfy an individual ambition, but
to make a strong showing for the
University. Each one has only a
single chance in six of securing the
medal for himself, and yet, what
ever the decision, we shall have the
satisfaction of knowing that we
were well represented. Predictions
are out of the question, and all we
can say to the team is this:
Gentlemen, we expect one of you
i to bring home theCarnot medal.
