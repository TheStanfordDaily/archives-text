# Track Forces Increase.
## 
### 
There was a large increase in the
number of men who got out on the
turf yesterday afternoon and who
may he expected to he out for reg
ular training on the track for some
time to come. The number hitherto
has rarely exceeded fifty, but last
night there were between seventy
five and one hundred. This will
produce good results, as it
gives the trainer and captain a
larger number of men to choose
from. The big increase was due
largely to the fact that the men
:ire now allowed to substitute track
for gymnasium work.
