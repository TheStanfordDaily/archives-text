Loofbourow's first attempt in a

preliminaries of 1897. In the
recent Carnot finals he was the
only man from either California or
Stanford who was chosen from the
affirmative side of the question de
bated. In the campaign during
the fall of 1900 for the Stanford
constitutional amendment he made
many speeches in San Francisco
for the measure.
