A MOVEMENT is Oil foot among
certain alumni and students here
to have a student body law adopted
at Stanford similar to one in force
at Princeton, whereby the students
take it upon themselves to discover
and try persons guilty of inten
tional injury of any sort to Univer
sity buildings and property. Un
der the proposed plan, anyone
found guilty would be recom
mended to the University authori
ties for dismissal. This method of
dealing with the kind of vandalism
practiced more or less since the
opening of the University proves
effective at Princeton, and would
put a stop to depredations here.
Whatever destruction and petty
thefts are committed by individu
als, whether from thoughtlessness
or otherwise, violate the sacredness
of the University buildings and re
flect stigma upon the student body
at large. It is probable that few
people realize the aggregate num
ber of such acts committed, for
there are certainly few if any bona
fide members of the student body
who are guilty. Of late, however,
depredations in connection with

the new buildings and the Memo
rial Church make action impera
tive, if we would relieve ourselves
of the appearance of responsibility
for the destruction. Everyone will
resent the imputation that students
would commit such outrages as the
recent taking of pieces from the
mosaic work on the church. The
Stanford man and woman are
proud of "the most satisfying
group of academic buildings in
America,"and are anxious to pro
tect them, by organized vigilance,
if necessary.
