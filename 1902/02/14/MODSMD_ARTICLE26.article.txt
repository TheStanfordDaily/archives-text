# "Pirates" Nearly Ready.
## 
### 
The finishing touches are being
put on the production of "The Pi
rates of Penzance," which holds
down the hoards next Friday night
at Assembly Hall. Both princi
pals and chorus are almost letter
perfect in their parts, it now being
merely a matter of perfection of de
tails. Nightly rehearsals have
been held the past week in Assem
bly Hall, with the result that the
opera is now just about ready for
presentation. The costumes and
scenery, which come from the Tiv
oli in San Francisco, will arrive to
morrow. The principals, all of
whom have done exceptionally well
in the rehearsals, are Mtb. Roberts,
Miss Bartlett, Miss Shreckhise,
Miss Kirkpatrick, Dr. Little,
Charles Firebaugh, E. W. Prentice,
and R. E. Warfield. The chorus
numbers about fifty. The orches
tra, under Professor Weer's direc
tion, has the opera splendidly in
hand. The whole production, it is
said, will be a revelation.
