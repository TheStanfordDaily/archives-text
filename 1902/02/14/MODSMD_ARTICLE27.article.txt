Speaking of the Chicago Sym
phony Orchestra which appears in
the Assembly Hall on the '27th,
the Detroit Evening News has the
following to say: "The music af
forded was of the best. The or
chestra numbers fifty-one men, and
in the balancing and placing of the
parts Mr. Rosenbecker has laid a
foundation which results in an ex
cellent quality of tone. The over
tures and symphonies were read
with an intelligent appreciation of
the score. The adagio and scherzo

from Mendelssohn's Scotch sym
phony were played very well; the
peculiar wailing theme, like the
lament of a clan, which runs
through the adagio, and the gay,
dancing strains of the scherzo,
which make one think of the High
land fling and hear the piper com
ing over the hills, were given with
equal finish by the orchestra. Mr.
Rosenbeeker lias complete com
mand of his men, and directs with
a quiet force and simplicity of
manner good to see."
