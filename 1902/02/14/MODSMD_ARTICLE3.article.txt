# One Hundred Went to Berkeley.
## 
### 
About a hundred certificates were
given out from the Registrar's of
lice for reduced rates to San Fran
cisco today. Aside from this there
were a large number who went, from
Palo Alto without the certificates,
avoiding a trip to the quad on ac
count of the weather. This means
that Stanford will be well repre
sented at the Carnot debate in
Berkeley tonight.
The three judges of the debate,
who were finally selected this morn
ing after some difficulty, are Ralph
Harrison, justice of the State Su
preme Court; F. H. Wheelan, pres
ident of the University Club; and
Samuel Knight, member of the San
Francisco law firm of McCutcheon,
Page, Knight and Hardy. The
last named acted as judge of the
Intercollegiate of last season.
