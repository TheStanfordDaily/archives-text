# Discussion of Psychology.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Educa
tional Journal Cluh last night the
topic for the evening was a review
of recent discussion on the ex
pediency of psychology in the sec
ondary school curriculum. It has
already begun to find a place in
the high school course. In the
United States four per cent of the
students study psychology, which
exceeds the number who study
Greek.
In considering its practicability,

a review was given of Home of the
recent elementary text-books, in
cluding Titchener'H Primer of
Psychology, James' Talks, Bald
win's Story of the Mind, Thorn
dyke's Human Nature Club. Pos
sible courses of study indepen
dent of text-books were outlined.
One of the leading points
of interest was whether the
study of psychology is well adapt
ed, by any method of approach, to
students of high school grade, or
whether the mental peculiarities of
that period of life do not point
toward the advisability of reserv
ing it exclusively for the college
course, its culture value,, aside
from any consideration of univer
sity preparation, was considered,
and whether it might to advantage
replace in part some of the studies
which owe their large place in the
curriculum to a past utility which
has been largely outgrown.
