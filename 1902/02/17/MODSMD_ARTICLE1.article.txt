# WAGNER BROUGHT THE MEDAL HOME.
## Stanford Man Excelled in the Carnot at Berkeley Friday Night and Wins Victory for the Cardinal.—Review of the Debate. 
### 
Fletcher Bernard Wagner won
the Carnot medal last Friday night,
and thus brought victory to Stan
ford for the second consecutive time
in this contest, and for the third
time since it was instituted in 1895.
When the judges, after deliberation
for a full half hour, announced
their decision to the great audience,
the little group of sixty or seventy
Stanford people became almost de
lirious with enthusiasm, and the
Blue and Gold rooters generously
applauded the winner. It is the
first victory Stanford has gained on
California's own territory.
The debate was one of the best
and one of the closest ever held be
tween the two universities, and the
arguments were uniformly strong.
Wagner excelled because of his
fundamental grasp of the subject,
his ability and cleverness in pre
senting a comprehensive argument
in the time allotted without burden
ing it by details, facts, and inci
dents, and his spontaneity and
magnetism of manner. Allen, of
California, who was ranked second
by the judges, exhibited strong, in
dividual force, and an aggressive
ness that carried much weight; his
style was altogether different from
the Stanford man's, and was not
equally polished, but the time con
sumed by the judges in reaching a
decision indicates how nearly equal
they considered the merits of the
two. Jones for Stanford made a
remarkably clear, well proportioned
speech, but he failed in some degree
to put the tire into his effort that he
showed in the finals. Martin, of
California, spoke in his charac
teristic manner, and gave careful
argument which, however, lost force
because he attempted to compress
too much into it for the time given
him; this feature of Martin's speech
emphasized by contrast the strength
of Wagner's handling of the ques
tion. Itice gave one of the best
arguments of the evening, but he
did not do himself full justice in
delivery because of an apparent un
certainty and hesitancy at times
in the use of words. Rothchild,
California's first speaker, gave a
fluent and careful opening argu
ment, but weakened his standing
considerably by his rapid, almost
frantic, rebutta 1.
Before 8 o'clock Harmon gymna
sium was tilled both on the main
floor and in the gallery with a
crowd of nearly 2500 people. Blue
and Cold and Cardinal bunting
were profusely draped from the bal
cony and ceiling and at the sides
and rear of the stage, while French
and American flags hung above the
platform. The Stanford support
ers, most of whom had arrived at
7:30, were met at the station and
directed to the gymnasium, where
150 seats had been reserved at the
left of the stage. The visitors were
given a hearty welcome by the big
crowd of California rooters, who sat
at the right and were already yell
ing in wonderful unison. Good

natured bantering between the two
sections preceded the debate, and
although the volume of sound
seemed small from the Stanford
contingent, the Cardinal held its
own in vigor and in repartee. An
oil stove stood on the stage, and
the Stanford crowd called out: "Is
that stove to keep your feet warm,
Berkeley?" whereupon the (J. (J.
forces responded, "It's on your
side, Stanford," and the Cardinal
men immediately rejoined, "It's off
side, Berkeley." As usual, the re
marks had reference to past con
tests, and each side came in for its
share of embarrassment.
Professor C. M. Gay ley of Califor
nia presided with his customary
ease. He stated the question for
debate: "Resolved, That the Presi
dent of the French Republic should
be elected by direct vote of the
people," and instructed the judges,
Messrs. F. H. Wheeler, president of
the University Club, Samuel Knight
of the law firm of McCutcheon,
I'age, Knight and Hardy, and
E. S. Fowler of San Francisco, who
had taken the place of the Hon.
Ralph C. Harrison, to base their
decision on the best argument
showing a grasp and knowledge of
the subject, skill in presentation,
and appearance of spontaneity.
Each speaker was allowed fifteen
minutes, to be divided as he desired
between his first speech and his
rebuttal.
The Arg'uments.
Herbert 1). Rothchild of Califor
nia opened the debate. II« «>\u
lined the present form of French
government,calling ita parliament
ary system in which the ministry
acted as the real executive. He
said that the lack of political
parties in France was responsible
for the evils in administration.
Direct election of the president
would remedy these evils, by put
ting party issues before the people.
Rothchild stated bis case clearly
and well, and his delivery was
smooth and polished. His voice
lacked conveying power, however,
and he spoke a trifle too fast.
E. W. Rice, '02, opened the ar
gument for the negative. He main
tained that the proposed change
would introduce an element of dis
cord into French administration,
dividing the people against them
selves. There can be no t wo powers
in France. The people are not
ready for complete self-government,
and do not desire it. The time is
not ripe for an introduction of the
party system. Rice delivered a
sound, well prepared speech, and his
argument was one of the best of the
whole debate, but it lost force by
his apparent nervousness of man
ner and hesitancy in pronunciation.
F. B. Wagner spoke next for the
affirmative. In part, he said:
"The gentleman of the negative
has left one principle unassailed, —
the principle of democratic govern
ment. Democracy has been the
ideal of Frenchmen battling

J against the tradition of monarchy.
The present form of election is a
I compromise with the past. Direct
election will have a democratic
effect on the entire machinery of
French government. It is one ele
ment in the complete democracy of
France.
"To say that Frenchmen are not
able to choose their president as we
choose ours—that is a tremendous
indictment to bring against the in
telligence of a race. This reform
is not incompatible with the vivac
ity of the French. They should
have a form of government that
will give a brief permanence to
their manifold division. But
among the negative doubts is an
other phantom—the spectre of
dictatorship. As a matter of fact,
where do dictators grow? There is
no spot in the courts of the world
today where a ditcator could more
quickly rise than in the fretful
French assembly.
"In one aspect, this problem has
a vital interest for you and me.
Today, the friendship of America
is at a premium. Our attitude to
ward France should not be one of
carping criticism. We can point
the way to a better democracy.
This reform will mean an example
of successful democracy to all the
powers of Europe, and for France
a better government than she has
ever known."
When Wagner finished his speech
he received hearty applause by the
whole audience. His argument
was brilliant, and he met the ob
jections of the first negative, and
answerered them skilfully. He
got at the essence of the question,
and brought out the principle of
optimism in reform. The conclu
sion of his speech, in which he
pointed out what the United States
coulil do toward liplping nP.fi to
a more complete democracy, became
genuinely eloquent, and his diction
throughout was graceful and be
yond criticism.
Frederick M. Allen of California
upheld the second negative with a
great deal of force and ability. He
attempted to prove three points:
Direct election will not cure the
evils in French administration, as
the remedy is worse than the dis
ease; the proposed reform stands
condemned before the bar of public
opinion; and the evils of French
government are deep-rooted in the
national characteristics of the
French, and therefore cannot be re
moved by a mere change in the
governmental machinery. The
plan was tried in 1848, and resulted
in failure and revolution, and has
been rejected by nine-tenths of the
French people —by all except the
Bonapartists. ''Doctrines,Jlike men,
are known by the company they
keep." Allen was applauded for
fully a minute by the California
rooters. Although his was the
shortest of any of the opening
speeches, he presented the case of
the negative in an almost invinci
ble argument. His delivery was of
the hammer and tongs variety.
His voice and manner were not
smooth nor pleasing, but they
proved effective.
Leon E. Martin, the only veteran
on either team, concluded the argu
ment for the affirmative. His

voice and mathematical method of
presentation resembled the style of
his brother, a former Carnot win
ner, but he lacked some of his
brother's ability in handling ma
terial and in sharp, telling deliv
ery. His speech was clear and
well prepared, and maintained that
popular election is a needed step in
the evolution of France. Repub
licanism is the political force dom
inating the French people and ex
cessive centralization is threatening
the power of the State. The reform
will cure existing evils and satisfy
the republican spirit of France.
H. C. Jones, '02, concluded for
the negative. His argument may
be briefly analyzed thus: Direct
election of the French executive is
incompatible with the French con
stitution, and would place power
in the hands of a dictator; the re
form will not result in the forma
tion of political parties, because the
French lack the capacity for polit
ical cohesion; France needs har
mony in her administration, not
change; her people are impulsive
and ever ready to submit to a dic
tator, —to place a popular hero in
supreme power. "Popular election
will overthrow the Third Republic,
and establish a tyranny more real
than that of any monarch." Jones
was superior in epigrammatic force
and eloquence of presentation, and
his address showed more strongly
than any other the qualities of an
oration.
The rebuttal work by all of the
debaters was clever and spontane
ous. Rothchild spoke one and
three-quarter minutes, but very
much too rapidly. Rice replied
ably in a speech of four and three
fourths minutes. Wagner had
only one and one-half minutes for
refutation, during which he han
dled his opponents' arguments
cleverly, out wnn hardly iiic [u.m
that lie did in opening, due,
perhaps, to bis lack of time;
lie concluded with an appeal for
constructive statesmanship. Allen's
rebuttal speech lasted live and a
quarter minutes, and it was com
prehensive, keen, and destructive.
Martin summarized his first argu
ment and tried to answer the ob
jections of his opponents; he con
sumed four and a half minutes.
Jones concluded the debate with a
five-minute rebuttal, in which he
strengthened his former position.
During the interval of half an
hour between the debate and the
decision of the judges, the rooters
of both universities waited in the
usual state of tense impatience.
The Stanford contingent felt
reasonably confident of victory,
and the feeling of the Blue and
Gold was typified by the president
of one of the debating societies, who
said that be thought Allen had
won, but he was afraid of Wagner.
At last, one of the judges put an
end to the suspense by advancing
slowly from the room of consulta
tion, and announcing that for in
formation on the subject, good de
livery, skill in debate, and spon
taneity, the judges had decided to
award the medal to Wagner.
In discussing the merits of the
debate later, the judges expressed
themselves as well satisfied with
the showing made by both teams.
They said this was one of the best
intercollegiate forensic contests
they had ever heard. If it had
been between the two university
teams, they would have awarded
the decision to California.
Fletcher Bernard Wagner won
the Carnot medal last Friday night,
and thus brought victory to Stan
ford for the second consecutive time
in this contest, and for the third
time since it was instituted in 1895.

governmental machinery. The
plan was tried in 1848, and resulted
in failure and revolution, and has
been rejected by nine-tenths of the
French people —by all except the
Bonapartists. ''Doctrines,Jlike men,
are known by the company they
keep." Allen was applauded for
fully a minute by the California
rooters. Although his was the
shortest of any of the opening
speeches, he presented the case of
the negative in an almost invinci
ble argument. His delivery was of
the hammer and tongs variety.
His voice and manner were not
smooth nor pleasing, but they
proved effective.
Leon E. Martin, the only veteran
on either team, concluded the argu
ment for the affirmative. His

voice and mathematical method of
presentation resembled the style of
his brother, a former Carnot win
ner, but he lacked some of his
brother's ability in handling ma
terial and in sharp, telling deliv
ery. His speech was clear and
well prepared, and maintained that
popular election is a needed step in
the evolution of France. Repub
licanism is the political force dom
inating the French people and ex
cessive centralization is threatening
the power of the State. The reform
will cure existing evils and satisfy
the republican spirit of France.
H. C. Jones, '02, concluded for
the negative. His argument may
be briefly analyzed thus: Direct
election of the French executive is
incompatible with the French con
stitution, and would place power
in the hands of a dictator; the re
form will not result in the forma
tion of political parties, because the
French lack the capacity for polit
ical cohesion; France needs har
mony in her administration, not
change; her people are impulsive
and ever ready to submit to a dic
tator, —to place a popular hero in
supreme power. "Popular election
will overthrow the Third Republic,
and establish a tyranny more real
than that of any monarch." Jones
was superior in epigrammatic force
and eloquence of presentation, and
his address showed more strongly
than any other the qualities of an
oration.
The rebuttal work by all of the
debaters was clever and spontane
ous. Rothchild spoke one and
three-quarter minutes, but very
much too rapidly. Rice replied
ably in a speech of four and three
fourths minutes. Wagner had
only one and one-half minutes for
refutation, during which he han
dled his opponents' arguments
cleverly, out wnn hardly iiic [u.m
that lie did in opening, due,
perhaps, to bis lack of time;
lie concluded with an appeal for
constructive statesmanship. Allen's
rebuttal speech lasted live and a
quarter minutes, and it was com
prehensive, keen, and destructive.
Martin summarized his first argu
ment and tried to answer the ob
jections of his opponents; he con
sumed four and a half minutes.
Jones concluded the debate with a
five-minute rebuttal, in which he
strengthened his former position.
During the interval of half an
hour between the debate and the
decision of the judges, the rooters
of both universities waited in the
usual state of tense impatience.
The Stanford contingent felt
reasonably confident of victory,
and the feeling of the Blue and
Gold was typified by the president
of one of the debating societies, who
said that be thought Allen had
won, but he was afraid of Wagner.
At last, one of the judges put an
end to the suspense by advancing
slowly from the room of consulta
tion, and announcing that for in
formation on the subject, good de
livery, skill in debate, and spon
taneity, the judges had decided to
award the medal to Wagner.
In discussing the merits of the
debate later, the judges expressed
themselves as well satisfied with
the showing made by both teams.
They said this was one of the best
intercollegiate forensic contests
they had ever heard. If it had
been between the two university
teams, they would have awarded
the decision to California.
Fletcher Bernard Wagner won
the Carnot medal last Friday night,
and thus brought victory to Stan
ford for the second consecutive time
in this contest, and for the third
time since it was instituted in 1895.
When the judges, after deliberation
for a full half hour, announced
their decision to the great audience,
the little group of sixty or seventy
Stanford people became almost de
lirious with enthusiasm, and the
Blue and Gold rooters generously
applauded the winner. It is the
first victory Stanford has gained on
California's own territory.
The debate was one of the best
and one of the closest ever held be
tween the two universities, and the
arguments were uniformly strong.
Wagner excelled because of his
fundamental grasp of the subject,
his ability and cleverness in pre
senting a comprehensive argument
in the time allotted without burden
ing it by details, facts, and inci
dents, and his spontaneity and
magnetism of manner. Allen, of
California, who was ranked second
by the judges, exhibited strong, in
dividual force, and an aggressive
ness that carried much weight; his
style was altogether different from
the Stanford man's, and was not
equally polished, but the time con
sumed by the judges in reaching a
decision indicates how nearly equal
they considered the merits of the
two. Jones for Stanford made a
remarkably clear, well proportioned
speech, but he failed in some degree
to put the tire into his effort that he
showed in the finals. Martin, of
California, spoke in his charac
teristic manner, and gave careful
argument which, however, lost force
because he attempted to compress
too much into it for the time given
him; this feature of Martin's speech
emphasized by contrast the strength
of Wagner's handling of the ques
tion. Itice gave one of the best
arguments of the evening, but he
did not do himself full justice in
delivery because of an apparent un
certainty and hesitancy at times
in the use of words. Rothchild,
California's first speaker, gave a
fluent and careful opening argu
ment, but weakened his standing
considerably by his rapid, almost
frantic, rebutta 1.
Before 8 o'clock Harmon gymna
sium was tilled both on the main
floor and in the gallery with a
crowd of nearly 2500 people. Blue
and Cold and Cardinal bunting
were profusely draped from the bal
cony and ceiling and at the sides
and rear of the stage, while French
and American flags hung above the
platform. The Stanford support
ers, most of whom had arrived at
7:30, were met at the station and
directed to the gymnasium, where
150 seats had been reserved at the
left of the stage. The visitors were
given a hearty welcome by the big
crowd of California rooters, who sat
at the right and were already yell
ing in wonderful unison. Good

natured bantering between the two
sections preceded the debate, and
although the volume of sound
seemed small from the Stanford
contingent, the Cardinal held its
own in vigor and in repartee. An
oil stove stood on the stage, and
the Stanford crowd called out: "Is
that stove to keep your feet warm,
Berkeley?" whereupon the (J. (J.
forces responded, "It's on your
side, Stanford," and the Cardinal
men immediately rejoined, "It's off
side, Berkeley." As usual, the re
marks had reference to past con
tests, and each side came in for its
share of embarrassment.
Professor C. M. Gay ley of Califor
nia presided with his customary
ease. He stated the question for
debate: "Resolved, That the Presi
dent of the French Republic should
be elected by direct vote of the
people," and instructed the judges,
Messrs. F. H. Wheeler, president of
the University Club, Samuel Knight
of the law firm of McCutcheon,
I'age, Knight and Hardy, and
E. S. Fowler of San Francisco, who
had taken the place of the Hon.
Ralph C. Harrison, to base their
decision on the best argument
showing a grasp and knowledge of
the subject, skill in presentation,
and appearance of spontaneity.
Each speaker was allowed fifteen
minutes, to be divided as he desired
between his first speech and his
rebuttal.
The Arg'uments.
Herbert 1). Rothchild of Califor
nia opened the debate. II« «>\u
lined the present form of French
government,calling ita parliament
ary system in which the ministry
acted as the real executive. He
said that the lack of political
parties in France was responsible
for the evils in administration.
Direct election of the president
would remedy these evils, by put
ting party issues before the people.
Rothchild stated bis case clearly
and well, and his delivery was
smooth and polished. His voice
lacked conveying power, however,
and he spoke a trifle too fast.
E. W. Rice, '02, opened the ar
gument for the negative. He main
tained that the proposed change
would introduce an element of dis
cord into French administration,
dividing the people against them
selves. There can be no t wo powers
in France. The people are not
ready for complete self-government,
and do not desire it. The time is
not ripe for an introduction of the
party system. Rice delivered a
sound, well prepared speech, and his
argument was one of the best of the
whole debate, but it lost force by
his apparent nervousness of man
ner and hesitancy in pronunciation.
F. B. Wagner spoke next for the
affirmative. In part, he said:
"The gentleman of the negative
has left one principle unassailed, —
the principle of democratic govern
ment. Democracy has been the
ideal of Frenchmen battling

J against the tradition of monarchy.
The present form of election is a
I compromise with the past. Direct
election will have a democratic
effect on the entire machinery of
French government. It is one ele
ment in the complete democracy of
France.
"To say that Frenchmen are not
able to choose their president as we
choose ours—that is a tremendous
indictment to bring against the in
telligence of a race. This reform
is not incompatible with the vivac
ity of the French. They should
have a form of government that
will give a brief permanence to
their manifold division. But
among the negative doubts is an
other phantom—the spectre of
dictatorship. As a matter of fact,
where do dictators grow? There is
no spot in the courts of the world
today where a ditcator could more
quickly rise than in the fretful
French assembly.
"In one aspect, this problem has
a vital interest for you and me.
Today, the friendship of America
is at a premium. Our attitude to
ward France should not be one of
carping criticism. We can point
the way to a better democracy.
This reform will mean an example
of successful democracy to all the
powers of Europe, and for France
a better government than she has
ever known."
When Wagner finished his speech
he received hearty applause by the
whole audience. His argument
was brilliant, and he met the ob
jections of the first negative, and
answerered them skilfully. He
got at the essence of the question,
and brought out the principle of
optimism in reform. The conclu
sion of his speech, in which he
pointed out what the United States
coulil do toward liplping nP.fi to
a more complete democracy, became
genuinely eloquent, and his diction
throughout was graceful and be
yond criticism.
Frederick M. Allen of California
upheld the second negative with a
great deal of force and ability. He
attempted to prove three points:
Direct election will not cure the
evils in French administration, as
the remedy is worse than the dis
ease; the proposed reform stands
condemned before the bar of public
opinion; and the evils of French
government are deep-rooted in the
national characteristics of the
French, and therefore cannot be re
moved by a mere change in the
governmental machinery. The
plan was tried in 1848, and resulted
in failure and revolution, and has
been rejected by nine-tenths of the
French people —by all except the
Bonapartists. ''Doctrines,Jlike men,
are known by the company they
keep." Allen was applauded for

showing a grasp and knowledge of
the subject, skill in presentation,
and appearance of spontaneity.
Each speaker was allowed fifteen
minutes, to be divided as he desired
between his first speech and his
rebuttal.
The Arg'uments.
Herbert 1). Rothchild of Califor
nia opened the debate. II« «>\u
lined the present form of French
government,calling ita parliament
ary system in which the ministry
acted as the real executive. He
said that the lack of political
parties in France was responsible
for the evils in administration.
Direct election of the president
would remedy these evils, by put
ting party issues before the people.
Rothchild stated bis case clearly
and well, and his delivery was
smooth and polished. His voice
lacked conveying power, however,
and he spoke a trifle too fast.
E. W. Rice, '02, opened the ar
gument for the negative. He main
tained that the proposed change
would introduce an element of dis
cord into French administration,
dividing the people against them
selves. There can be no t wo powers
in France. The people are not
ready for complete self-government,
and do not desire it. The time is
not ripe for an introduction of the
party system. Rice delivered a
sound, well prepared speech, and his
argument was one of the best of the
whole debate, but it lost force by
his apparent nervousness of man
ner and hesitancy in pronunciation.
F. B. Wagner spoke next for the
affirmative. In part, he said:
"The gentleman of the negative
has left one principle unassailed, —
the principle of democratic govern
ment. Democracy has been the
ideal of Frenchmen battling

J against the tradition of monarchy.
The present form of election is a
I compromise with the past. Direct
election will have a democratic
effect on the entire machinery of
French government. It is one ele
ment in the complete democracy of
France.
"To say that Frenchmen are not
able to choose their president as we
choose ours—that is a tremendous
indictment to bring against the in
telligence of a race. This reform
is not incompatible with the vivac
ity of the French. They should
have a form of government that
will give a brief permanence to
their manifold division. But
among the negative doubts is an
other phantom—the spectre of
dictatorship. As a matter of fact,
where do dictators grow? There is
no spot in the courts of the world
today where a ditcator could more
quickly rise than in the fretful
French assembly.
"In one aspect, this problem has
a vital interest for you and me.
Today, the friendship of America
is at a premium. Our attitude to
ward France should not be one of
carping criticism. We can point
the way to a better democracy.
This reform will mean an example
of successful democracy to all the
powers of Europe, and for France
a better government than she has
ever known."
When Wagner finished his speech
he received hearty applause by the
whole audience. His argument
was brilliant, and he met the ob
jections of the first negative, and
answerered them skilfully. He
got at the essence of the question,
and brought out the principle of
optimism in reform. The conclu
sion of his speech, in which he
pointed out what the United States
coulil do toward liplping nP.fi to
a more complete democracy, became
genuinely eloquent, and his diction
throughout was graceful and be
yond criticism.
Frederick M. Allen of California
upheld the second negative with a
great deal of force and ability. He
attempted to prove three points:
Direct election will not cure the
evils in French administration, as
the remedy is worse than the dis
ease; the proposed reform stands
condemned before the bar of public
opinion; and the evils of French
government are deep-rooted in the
national characteristics of the
French, and therefore cannot be re
moved by a mere change in the
governmental machinery. The
plan was tried in 1848, and resulted
in failure and revolution, and has
been rejected by nine-tenths of the
French people —by all except the
Bonapartists. ''Doctrines,Jlike men,
are known by the company they
keep." Allen was applauded for
fully a minute by the California
rooters. Although his was the
shortest of any of the opening
speeches, he presented the case of
the negative in an almost invinci
ble argument. His delivery was of
the hammer and tongs variety.
His voice and manner were not
smooth nor pleasing, but they
proved effective.
Leon E. Martin, the only veteran
on either team, concluded the argu
ment for the affirmative. His

voice and mathematical method of
presentation resembled the style of
his brother, a former Carnot win
ner, but he lacked some of his
brother's ability in handling ma
terial and in sharp, telling deliv
ery. His speech was clear and
well prepared, and maintained that
popular election is a needed step in
the evolution of France. Repub
licanism is the political force dom
inating the French people and ex
cessive centralization is threatening
the power of the State. The reform
will cure existing evils and satisfy
the republican spirit of France.
H. C. Jones, '02, concluded for
the negative. His argument may
be briefly analyzed thus: Direct
election of the French executive is
incompatible with the French con
stitution, and would place power
in the hands of a dictator; the re
form will not result in the forma
tion of political parties, because the
French lack the capacity for polit
ical cohesion; France needs har
mony in her administration, not
change; her people are impulsive
and ever ready to submit to a dic
tator, —to place a popular hero in
supreme power. "Popular election
will overthrow the Third Republic,
and establish a tyranny more real
than that of any monarch." Jones
was superior in epigrammatic force
and eloquence of presentation, and
his address showed more strongly
than any other the qualities of an
oration.
The rebuttal work by all of the
debaters was clever and spontane
ous. Rothchild spoke one and
three-quarter minutes, but very
much too rapidly. Rice replied
ably in a speech of four and three
fourths minutes. Wagner had
only one and one-half minutes for
refutation, during which he han
dled his opponents' arguments
cleverly, out wnn hardly iiic [u.m
that lie did in opening, due,
perhaps, to bis lack of time;
lie concluded with an appeal for
constructive statesmanship. Allen's
rebuttal speech lasted live and a
quarter minutes, and it was com
prehensive, keen, and destructive.
Martin summarized his first argu
ment and tried to answer the ob
jections of his opponents; he con
sumed four and a half minutes.
Jones concluded the debate with a
five-minute rebuttal, in which he
strengthened his former position.
During the interval of half an
hour between the debate and the
decision of the judges, the rooters
of both universities waited in the
usual state of tense impatience.
The Stanford contingent felt
reasonably confident of victory,
and the feeling of the Blue and
Gold was typified by the president
of one of the debating societies, who
said that be thought Allen had
won, but he was afraid of Wagner.
At last, one of the judges put an
end to the suspense by advancing
slowly from the room of consulta
tion, and announcing that for in
formation on the subject, good de
livery, skill in debate, and spon
taneity, the judges had decided to
award the medal to Wagner.
In discussing the merits of the
debate later, the judges expressed
themselves as well satisfied with
the showing made by both teams.
They said this was one of the best
intercollegiate forensic contests
they had ever heard. If it had
been between the two university
teams, they would have awarded
the decision to California.
Fletcher Bernard Wagner won
the Carnot medal last Friday night,
and thus brought victory to Stan
ford for the second consecutive time
in this contest, and for the third
time since it was instituted in 1895.
When the judges, after deliberation
for a full half hour, announced
their decision to the great audience,
the little group of sixty or seventy
Stanford people became almost de
lirious with enthusiasm, and the
Blue and Gold rooters generously
applauded the winner. It is the
first victory Stanford has gained on
California's own territory.
The debate was one of the best
and one of the closest ever held be
tween the two universities, and the
arguments were uniformly strong.
Wagner excelled because of his
fundamental grasp of the subject,
his ability and cleverness in pre
senting a comprehensive argument
in the time allotted without burden
ing it by details, facts, and inci
dents, and his spontaneity and
magnetism of manner. Allen, of
California, who was ranked second
by the judges, exhibited strong, in
dividual force, and an aggressive
ness that carried much weight; his
style was altogether different from
the Stanford man's, and was not
equally polished, but the time con
sumed by the judges in reaching a
decision indicates how nearly equal
they considered the merits of the
two. Jones for Stanford made a
remarkably clear, well proportioned
speech, but he failed in some degree
to put the tire into his effort that he
showed in the finals. Martin, of
California, spoke in his charac
teristic manner, and gave careful
argument which, however, lost force
because he attempted to compress
too much into it for the time given
him; this feature of Martin's speech
emphasized by contrast the strength
of Wagner's handling of the ques
tion. Itice gave one of the best
arguments of the evening, but he
did not do himself full justice in
delivery because of an apparent un
certainty and hesitancy at times
in the use of words. Rothchild,
California's first speaker, gave a
fluent and careful opening argu
ment, but weakened his standing
considerably by his rapid, almost
frantic, rebutta 1.
Before 8 o'clock Harmon gymna
sium was tilled both on the main
floor and in the gallery with a
crowd of nearly 2500 people. Blue
and Cold and Cardinal bunting
were profusely draped from the bal
cony and ceiling and at the sides
and rear of the stage, while French
and American flags hung above the
platform. The Stanford support
ers, most of whom had arrived at
7:30, were met at the station and
directed to the gymnasium, where
150 seats had been reserved at the
left of the stage. The visitors were
given a hearty welcome by the big
crowd of California rooters, who sat
at the right and were already yell
ing in wonderful unison. Good

natured bantering between the two
sections preceded the debate, and
although the volume of sound
seemed small from the Stanford
contingent, the Cardinal held its
own in vigor and in repartee. An
oil stove stood on the stage, and
the Stanford crowd called out: "Is
that stove to keep your feet warm,
Berkeley?" whereupon the (J. (J.
forces responded, "It's on your
side, Stanford," and the Cardinal
men immediately rejoined, "It's off
side, Berkeley." As usual, the re
marks had reference to past con
tests, and each side came in for its
share of embarrassment.
Professor C. M. Gay ley of Califor
nia presided with his customary
ease. He stated the question for
debate: "Resolved, That the Presi
dent of the French Republic should
be elected by direct vote of the
people," and instructed the judges,
Messrs. F. H. Wheeler, president of
the University Club, Samuel Knight
of the law firm of McCutcheon,
I'age, Knight and Hardy, and
E. S. Fowler of San Francisco, who
had taken the place of the Hon.
Ralph C. Harrison, to base their
decision on the best argument
showing a grasp and knowledge of
the subject, skill in presentation,
and appearance of spontaneity.
