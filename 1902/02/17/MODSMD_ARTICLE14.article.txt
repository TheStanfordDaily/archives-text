# Washington Requests Changes
## 
### 
The University of Washington
will agree to the conditions sent
from Stanford, and the debate be
tween the two universities will be
held here. A request is made by
the Washington committee, how
ever, that tlie time be extended to
May 2d, and that Stanford tele
graph the question instead of send
ing it by mail. They also request
that in case the judges cannot be
chosen from the list submitted by
Stanford, the visiting team may
send down a list, of ten, from which
the rewarding judges sha 11 be taken.
