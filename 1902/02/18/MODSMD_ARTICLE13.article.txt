### 
A dispatch to the Call from Los
Angeles, dated last night, says:

Mrs. June L. Stanford was in Los
Angeles today en route from New
York to San Francisco. While her
train was at the Arcade station she
confirmed the report that Stanford
University was to have several ad
ditional new structures. Mrs. Stan
ford said:
"We have in view a new library
building and a new gymnasium.
The plans for both will be approved
when I reach home. Our present
library building will be used exclu
sively as a law library, and the new
building is expected to meet the
university's requirements for the
next fifty years. The plans are to
be patterned after the Congressional
Library in Washington. 1 '
