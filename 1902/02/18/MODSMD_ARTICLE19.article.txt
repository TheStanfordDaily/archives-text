Editorially the Daily Califor
nian of yesterday morning com
ments on the Carnot thus:
Once again we have gone against
the enemy and we are theirs. There
is no use of crying over our spilled
milk. The judges considered that
the gentleman from Stanford who
won the medal was the best speaker.
About this we can have nothing to
say. That we lost was notour fault
nor the fault of our teams. Every
man vlid his best, and we appreciate
it. Jt was simply a case of sound
logic couched in earnest, straight
forward terms, pitted against ease
and fluency of an orator; and the
orator won. We are inclined to
agree with Professor Bacon when
he said: " The good of debating is
that it develops the power of clear
thinking and of clear expression.
And I am not sure but that the
power of expression is more valua
ble than that of thinking." The
Intercollegiate is still to come. Let
us see to it that we respect last
year's history.
