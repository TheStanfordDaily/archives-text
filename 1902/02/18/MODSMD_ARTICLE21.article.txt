# Professor Newcomer's Vacation.
## 
### 
Professor Alphonso G. Newcomer
of the English department will
leave the University in June for a
European trip covering at least one
semester. His plans are as yet
largely undetermined, hut it is cer
tain that the major portion of his
time will he divided between Eng
land and Italy. Professor New
comer's position at Stanford dates
from the opening of the University
in 1891, and during his ten years
of service his labors have been con
tinuous. The contemplated outing
will therefore he in the nature of a
sabbatical vacation.
