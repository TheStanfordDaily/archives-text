"The Unified Life," was the sub
ject of the Sunday sermon hy Pro
fessor A Iden. Jn brief the speaker
said: "Ordinary lives appear com
monplace as compared with those
of men in fiction or history, who
seem to have had definite aims,
thus accomplishing great ends.
The best way to appreciate the ad
vantage of a unitary life is by com
paring it with one that is not so.
A man should have principles
which do not make it necessary to
decide questions on little things
every time they arise. Temptation
has power over a life not unified.
Among students there are two
classes —those who make it a prin
ciple to do their work at the ap
pointed time, and those who are
always debating as to whether they
will do their work on lime. There
is no other lfberty like the strong
willed liberty of law, and little
choices merge into what will he
great choices or refusals.
"St. I'aul says,' Whatsoever ye do
in word or in deed do all in the
name of the Lord Jesus.' He
thought of life as organized toward
one ideal. Love is the unifying
principle of all virtues. The fam
ily must he united by it; and it
must not he a, mere principle or
form, but a force. Religion is not
a part, hut a mode of life."
