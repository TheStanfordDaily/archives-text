# Mr. Shimada's Painting.
## 
### 
A novel and most interesting en
tertainment was afforded the audi
ence which assembled in the Studio
yesterday to see Mr. Shimada, the
Japanese artist, paint. Upon his
knees—or, rather, upon "all fours"
—on a rug in the center of the
floor, surrounded by a dense ring
of observers, the Japanese profes
sional deftly and silently created
design after design. The work was
done in India ink used as a wash
—sometimes with the addition of a
little tender color. First came a
vigorous chrysanthemum plant
with a joyous bird singing in the
air above. Ten minutes later there
had irrown under that marvelous
brush, wielded at arm's length, a
splendid pike rushing open-jawed
through the water. Then came a
cockerel with alert eye and spring
ing tail; then another fish, a carp
rushing up a waterfall —in Japan
emblematic of theyoung man over
coming the obstacles of life. Next
appeared a fish-hawk on a pine
branch, a bunch of translucent
grapes, and so on—until some ten
or twelve beautiful designs were ly
ing round and the bus man ap

peared at the door to carry the
artint away.
Absolute attention was accorded
Mr. Shimada, and many were the
expressions of pleasure and aston
ishment at his art, while personal
dignity and kindliness of manner
made his observers his friends.
The works created during the ex
hibition were given to Ihe art stu
dents. His more elaborate pieces
—some dozen or more examples of
which are on the studio walls —will
remain there for a day or two.
