# FIELD-DAY OFF.
## Saturday's Track Meet Has Been Postponed for Better Weather. Training Notes. 
### 
The field-day for Saturday has
been called iff, owing to the fact
that the track will not he in condi
tion in time to bring out the men
for more than one or two practices
before the date set. The men are
Kti 11 working on the turf, the late
rain having interfered with spread
ing the cinders.
Last night about sixty men were
out, but u number of candidates
who have been showing up well
have not been attending, in the
opinion of the trainer, as regularly
to their work as they ought.
Among the men who lmve ap
peared for work and instruction
are: A. 11. Lett, '05, and I). Tar
pey, '05, in the quarter; U.S. Maw
kins, '05, 0. (i. Stanley, '05, Dud
ley, '05, 11. A. Campbell, '02, S. C.
Haver, '05, Hampson, '04, and
E. Y. Pomeroy, '05, in the distances;
C. \V. Thomas, '03, N. H. Braly, '05,
and J. li. Dehy, '03, in the weights;
F. VVoodhams, '05, in the high hur
dles.
W. H. Dole, athletic manager of
the Freshman class, has issued a
call for all candidates for the
Freshman team to get out immedi
ately. With the addition of those
who answer this call to the squad
of men who have commenced
training within the last two weeks,
the Freshman team promises to be
stronger than at first expected.
However, the manager says there
is plenty of room for new material.
Every Freshman who gets out
makes his team that much the
stronger, as it gives a larger choice
to the captain and coach. More
distance men are needed, more men
with the weights, more hurdlers
and jumpers.
