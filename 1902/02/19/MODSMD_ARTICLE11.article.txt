# STUDENTS AT OXFORD.
## Mr. Seward Described Life in the English University. 
### 
A large gathering filled the Uni-I
versity chapel last evening to listen
to the lecture given by Mr. Seward
on Oxford University. The lecturer'
opened with a short description of:
the building and grounds, and then
took up in detail the daily and
social life of the student. This in
cluded an interesting description of
the dormitory rooms and clubs, and
dealt in a humorous way with the
system of board and personal at
tention given by the university.
In connection with the institu-1
tional life, Mr. Seward stated that'
the original purpose of Oxford was
to provide a place where mature
men might carry on advanced re
search work, but that now students
step from college into civil-service
position under the government.
The rank in their examinations
grades them for the positions. A
few of the students are furnished
with fellowships, which they win in
competitive entrance examinations.
The university is divided into many
societies not unlike the fraternities
in American colleges. The students
are required to attend chapel, and
to dress in cap and gown, especi
ally when outside of the college
grounds.
Considerable interest is shown in
debating. The method of debate
follows very closely the plan used
in the English Parliament. The
decision is rendered by a vote of
the audience, and it is to he based
upon the convictions of the judges
at the close of the debate rather
than on the efficiency of the de
baters.
Mr. Seward also gave a detailed
account of the athletics at Oxford.
The university is divided into
several colleges, each of which has
its own well-kept grounds for
cricket, football, etc. iMore than
twenty colleges are represented in
all the lines of athletics. The va
rious colleges contest, and from the
contestants a team is chosen to
meet Cambridge. The men are
never out of training. They train
themselves and are at all times
ready to enter the contests. Row
ing is one of the chief sports.
Everybody exercises in the after
noon. There are no afternoon lec
tures. A very sportsmanlike feel
ing prevails among all. For in
stance, when Oxford had won the
rowing contest from Cambridge for
several successive years, she sent
her coach to train the Cambridge
men, who won after this for a few
years. Much enthusiasm is shown
at all athletic events.
Throughout his lecture Mr. Sew
ard brought in many amusing ac
counts of his personal experiences,
and many interesting facts in re
gard to the mannerisms and college
expressions of the English stu
dents.
