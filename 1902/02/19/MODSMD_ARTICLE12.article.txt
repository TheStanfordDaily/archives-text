The San Francisco Chronicle of
today bases its leading editorial on
I he reported probability of the
erection at Stanford of a new libra
ry to hold in the neighborhood of
1,000,000 volumes, calling atten

tion to the fact that it would rank
with the great libraries of the
world, and in this connection stat
ing that the two large and com
plete literary collections on the
Coast, the Bancroft and Sutro li
braries, are hoth in danger of being
broke!) up. These two libraries
together number 340,000 volumes.
The Bancroft collection, containing
60,000, is devoted almost entirely
to Western history, while the Sutro
collection is of a more general
nature. It contains, however,
many books which are priceless be
cause of their antiquity. In con
clusion, the editorial says:
"The erection of a big library
building for Stanford University
awakens the hope that they may
be both rescued and find an abid
ing resting-place within its walls.
All great libraries have attained
fame and value through the acqui
sition of special collections whose
notability is due to their complete
ness. If the Bancroft and Sutro
collections were absorbed by the
Stanford library they would give it
a standing as a great library at
once. The decision to erect the
structure comes at an opportune
time to save them from being
broken up and scattered abroad,
which would be as unfortunate as
it would be discreditable to the
State."
