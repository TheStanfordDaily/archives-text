Although the student hod) 7 is
much smaller here than at most
other institutions where dailies are
published and the support given
the paper is correspondingly less,
it may he of interest for our read
ers to know that the Daily Palo
Alto has been printing more words
in each issue than any of its con
temporaries in the field of college
journalism during the present year.
An estimate based on a number of
copies of the same dates shows an
average of the following number of
words in each issue: Indiana Stu
dent, 1750; Brown Herald, 2500;
Minnesota Daily, 2550; Daily Penn
sylranian, 2550: Harvard Crimson,
2(550; Daily Nebraskan, 2700; Yale
Neios, 2750; /)aiiy Calij'ornian,3oo();
Michigan Daily News, 3400; Daily
