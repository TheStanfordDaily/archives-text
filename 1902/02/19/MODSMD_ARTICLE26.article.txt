The Occident administers the fol- !
lowing rebuke to students who are;
said to have beaten their way into
a recent dance given by the Boat
ing Club at California:
"At the dance given last week
certain students of the university
were guilty of ungentleinanly con
duct. These men git i ned admission
to the floor of the gym through un
blushing fraud. Some of them rep
resented to the doorkeepers that
they were not going to dance, and
only wished to look on; as soon asj
they were inside the building they
gave up their intention of looking
on. Others presented "faked"
cards of admission. What makes
the matter all the more aggravated
is that none of these men ever ap
pear to be seriously handicapped
by the lack of funds. On the con
trary, on most occasions they seek
to convey the impression that they
do possess sufficient worldly goods.
They knew perfectly well that the
Boating Association gave the affair
to raise the money necessary to pay
the expense of shipping the shell
Harvard has donated out here. Yet
their conception of college spirit is
so lofty that they descend to de
ception to defraud the Boat Club
out of a few dollars. In the cnse,
say, of sophomores beating their
way into the fresbie glee there may
be a slight excuse, for it may be re
garded as an act of class rivalry,
the sophs merely endeavoring to
outwit the freshies. But under the
circumstances the action of these
men can only be branded as, to say
the least, ungentleinanly."
