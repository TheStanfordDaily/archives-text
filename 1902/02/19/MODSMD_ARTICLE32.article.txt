— Booker T. Washington applied
to President Northrop of Minnesota

—Indiana defeated Illinois in

ago. Its speakers defended the af
firmative side of the question, "Re
solved, That the early annexation
of the island to the United States
presents the wisest solution of the
problem of Cuba."
— August Hyllested, the noted
piano [(layer, has accepted the po
sition of piano instructor at the
University of Wisconsin left va
cant by the death of Professor
Smith. Mr. Hyllested was former
ly court musician of the King of
Sweden, and has for five years

—A statue of Eugene Sandow,
who is now exhibiting at Harvard,
will be given to that university by
him. This is the only instance of
an exact reproduction in plaster of
a living man, and there are only
two other copies of this statue in
existence. The Harvard Crivison
says: "Great difficulties were en
countered in obtaining the cast, as
it was necessary for the subject to
stand in a rigid position, with the
muscles tense, for twenty minutes
at a time, and 180 trials, covering
a period of several months, were
made before the experiments met
with success."
