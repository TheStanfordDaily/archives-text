# REPRESENT STANFORD.
## Several Players Will Enter California Club Tournaments Saturday. 
### 
A tournament of singles to be
given under the auspices of the
California Club on Washington's
Birthday will be participated in by
a number of Stanford tennis play
ers. Weihe, F. Leib, Hooper, Hop
per, Moore, Fuller, and perhaps a
number of others, will go up. In
consequence the tennis tournament
which was to have been held on the
Encina courts next Saturday will
be postponed until the Saturday
following. The opportunity for
play upon the California courts
will be gladly accepted by Stanford
players, as they are in every way
superior to the courts on the cam
pus, upon which preparation for an
intercollegiate contest is almost an
impossibility.
