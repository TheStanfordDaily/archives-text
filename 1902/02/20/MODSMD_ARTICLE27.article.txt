# Ran on the Cinders.
## 
### 
The new trade with its new coat
of cinders was used for the first
time last night, and so far seems to
he highly satisfactory. The per
formance of several of the men last
night was very good, considering
the condition of the path and the
fact that the men have been practic
ing on the turf for almost two weeks
past. Dunn ran a good quarter,
and Nangle and Gundrum went
through a very neat half-mile.
Trials and relay development will
go on now without much interrup
tion. If the weather permits, a large
number of trials will he run on Sat
urday.
