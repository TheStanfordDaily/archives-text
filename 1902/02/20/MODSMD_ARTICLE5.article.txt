# Faculty Wins at Baseball.
## 
### 
The Faculty baseball team de
feated the stick artists of Phi Delta
Tbeta yesterday l>v a score of ( J to
8. The game was played on the
Faculty Club grounds, and it was a
close light from start to finish, as
the score indicates. At the end of
the fourth inning Phi Delta Theta
had three marks in the book to two
for the Faculty. It was the fatal
fifth that changed the story.
Everybody went up in the air,
more or less, the Faculty piling up
live runs, while Phi Delta Theta
only got three. Each captured
two in the sixth, and that was all.
The teams lined up as follows:
FACULTY. PHI DELTA THETA.
