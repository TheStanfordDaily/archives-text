# DEBATERS FEASTED.
## Euphronia Banquet in Honor of Carnot Team Entirely Successful. 
### 
What will probably become a
college custom was initiated last
night when twenty-live members
of a literary society and nine in
vited guests united in a banquet at
Harriss' in honor of the Carnot de
bating team. This time the so
ciety was Euphronia which pro
vided the feast, because she claims
the medal winner; next season, as
Toastmaster McCormick took oc
casion to remark, the honor may
fall to one of the other organiza
tions, or in the case of an adverse
decision, there may be a toss-up
for the privilege.
The occasion was a happy one.
In the way of menu there was a
completeness that could but tempt
the most dedicate palate, and the
intellectual condiment was equally
inspiring. The themes of the re
sponses to the different toasts var
ied widely, anecodte and humor
ous reminiscence interspersed with
thoughtful analyses of Stanford's
debating positions and suggestions
making for future success. All
were in the sympathetic vein that
marks the best type of after-dinner
speaking, the company being seem
ingly inspirited by the presence of
the successful debaters. At the
head of the table sat F. B. Wagner,
the medalist, with Toastmaster
M. F. McCormick At the immedi
ate right were Jones and Lliee, the
other two debaters; Loofbourow,
the alternate; and English,
'00 and '01 Carnot teams. The
faculty guests, l'rofessors Lewers
and Alden and Instructors Bur
cham, '97, and Bassett, '01, were
seated at the left, with the Euphro
nians occupying the remaining
places.
After the repast had been served,
Toastmaster McCormick spoke of
the fact that students generally see
only the final contest of a debate
and do not observe the work re
quired for training and prepara
tion from day to day as in football
or on the track. He then called
on F. B. Wagner, the winner of the
debate, who discussed ''The Carnot
from the rostrum" in a happy vein,
explaining how everything had in
dicated the certainty of a Stanford
victory. Wagner complimented
his colleagues of the team, each of
whom stood for a style of debating
that would win the medal if the
judges were partial to either of the
methods, while he himself had a
premonition that something else
might (ill up the gaps. At the
close of his remarks Wagner held
up the trophy, saving he had dis
covered that it was not coined of
gold but of Palo Alto sunshine,
which meant continued future suc
cess for Stanford and indicated a
contrast with the fogs and mists of
Berkeley, which are not conducive
of optimism. The medal was then
passed around the table for each
one to examine.
Professor Alden spoke of the Car
not debate as it seemed to a mem
ber of the audience. He compli
mented the Carnot team very high
ly on the work they had done, and
praised the thorough argumenta

tive quality of California debating
as contrasted with the spread-eagle
oratorical contests of the Middle
West.
L. L. Loofbourow, '02, offered a
humorous defense of the position of
an alternate on an intercollegiate
team. There are four reasons
he said, among others and one
that appealed particularly to his
audience as being undeniably true,
was that any three men can make
a team, but there can be only one
alternate.
H. C. Jones, '02, spoke of the
difference between a Carnot and
Intercollegiate debate. The Carnot
is an individual contest —the best
man wins; while in an intercollegi
ate debate struggle is between two
teams —the best three men win, and
the individual is considered only
as a part of the perfected whole.
Mr. J. T. Burcham, '97, who, as
he himself remarked, is "the oldest
living graduate of the Stanford Law
School," outlined the history of
past debates between Stanford and
California. He said that California
has developed a definite debating
policy, in which faculty coaching
of the debaters, and a finished
manner of presentation, are dis
tinctive features. Stanford, on the
other hand, has always depended
on the originality and individuality
and individual merits of her de
baters.
Frank English, '01, continued
Mr. Burcham's line of thought
when he spoke of ''Our Present De
bating Policy." He said that Stan
ford ought not to stick too closely
to any one policy, but must always
be ready to adapt itself to the
necessities of a particular situation.
K. W. Rice, '02, in discussing our
chances in coining contests, said
that Stanford must not put too
much faith in her veterans, but
must try to develop her new de
bating material.
Professor Farrand, who was to
deliver a toast on "Eastern Debat
ing," was unable to be present.
The next speech fell to Professor
Lewers, who emphasized the value
of practice in debating to any one
who intended to be a lawyer.
Mr. L. E. Bassett, '01, had the
concluding toast in the absence of
Professor Howard. He spoke of the
value of literary societies as a train
ing school for young debaters.
With toasts to all the debating
societies and a rousing Stanford
yell, one of the most successful
banquets ever given at Stanford
came to an end.

much faith in her veterans, but
must try to develop her new de
bating material.
Professor Farrand, who was to
deliver a toast on "Eastern Debat
ing," was unable to be present.
The next speech fell to Professor
Lewers, who emphasized the value
of practice in debating to any one
who intended to be a lawyer.
Mr. L. E. Bassett, '01, had the
concluding toast in the absence of
Professor Howard. He spoke of the
value of literary societies as a train
ing school for young debaters.
With toasts to all the debating
societies and a rousing Stanford
yell, one of the most successful
banquets ever given at Stanford
came to an end.
What will probably become a
college custom was initiated last
night when twenty-live members
of a literary society and nine in
vited guests united in a banquet at
Harriss' in honor of the Carnot de
bating team. This time the so
ciety was Euphronia which pro
vided the feast, because she claims
the medal winner; next season, as
Toastmaster McCormick took oc
casion to remark, the honor may
fall to one of the other organiza
tions, or in the case of an adverse
decision, there may be a toss-up
for the privilege.
The occasion was a happy one.
In the way of menu there was a
completeness that could but tempt
the most dedicate palate, and the
intellectual condiment was equally
inspiring. The themes of the re
sponses to the different toasts var
ied widely, anecodte and humor
ous reminiscence interspersed with
thoughtful analyses of Stanford's
debating positions and suggestions
making for future success. All
were in the sympathetic vein that
marks the best type of after-dinner
speaking, the company being seem
ingly inspirited by the presence of
the successful debaters. At the
head of the table sat F. B. Wagner,
the medalist, with Toastmaster
M. F. McCormick At the immedi
ate right were Jones and Lliee, the
other two debaters; Loofbourow,
the alternate; and English,
'00 and '01 Carnot teams. The
faculty guests, l'rofessors Lewers
and Alden and Instructors Bur
cham, '97, and Bassett, '01, were
seated at the left, with the Euphro
nians occupying the remaining
places.
After the repast had been served,
Toastmaster McCormick spoke of
the fact that students generally see
only the final contest of a debate
and do not observe the work re
quired for training and prepara
tion from day to day as in football
or on the track. He then called
on F. B. Wagner, the winner of the
debate, who discussed ''The Carnot
from the rostrum" in a happy vein,
explaining how everything had in
dicated the certainty of a Stanford
victory. Wagner complimented
his colleagues of the team, each of
whom stood for a style of debating
that would win the medal if the
judges were partial to either of the
methods, while he himself had a
premonition that something else
might (ill up the gaps. At the
close of his remarks Wagner held
up the trophy, saving he had dis
covered that it was not coined of
gold but of Palo Alto sunshine,
which meant continued future suc
cess for Stanford and indicated a
contrast with the fogs and mists of
Berkeley, which are not conducive
of optimism. The medal was then
passed around the table for each
one to examine.
Professor Alden spoke of the Car
not debate as it seemed to a mem
ber of the audience. He compli
mented the Carnot team very high
ly on the work they had done, and
praised the thorough argumenta

tive quality of California debating
as contrasted with the spread-eagle
oratorical contests of the Middle
West.
L. L. Loofbourow, '02, offered a
humorous defense of the position of
an alternate on an intercollegiate
team. There are four reasons
he said, among others and one
that appealed particularly to his
audience as being undeniably true,
was that any three men can make
a team, but there can be only one
alternate.
H. C. Jones, '02, spoke of the
difference between a Carnot and
Intercollegiate debate. The Carnot
is an individual contest —the best
man wins; while in an intercollegi
ate debate struggle is between two
teams —the best three men win, and
the individual is considered only
as a part of the perfected whole.
Mr. J. T. Burcham, '97, who, as
he himself remarked, is "the oldest
living graduate of the Stanford Law
School," outlined the history of
past debates between Stanford and
California. He said that California
has developed a definite debating
policy, in which faculty coaching
of the debaters, and a finished
manner of presentation, are dis
tinctive features. Stanford, on the
other hand, has always depended
on the originality and individuality
and individual merits of her de
baters.
Frank English, '01, continued
Mr. Burcham's line of thought
when he spoke of ''Our Present De
bating Policy." He said that Stan
ford ought not to stick too closely
to any one policy, but must always
be ready to adapt itself to the
necessities of a particular situation.
K. W. Rice, '02, in discussing our
chances in coining contests, said
that Stanford must not put too
much faith in her veterans, but
must try to develop her new de
bating material.
Professor Farrand, who was to
