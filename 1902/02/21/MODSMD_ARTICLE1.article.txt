# SAYS IT'S WONDERFUL.
## Clarence Eddy, America's Most Noted Organist, Speaks Highly of the Chapel Organ. 
### 
Clarence Eddy came to the
University today and played on
the organ in the church during the
noon hour. Mr. Eddy is the most
noted of American organists. He
IB to America what Mr. Walter
Handel Thorey, who played here
the other day, is to England. He
has just been making a tour through
the Southern States and left for
Los Angeles this afternoon. Mr.
Eddy was not announced and in
consequence comparatively few stu
dents were enabled to enjoy his
playing. He played only during
the noon hour, when the men were
not working. He was obliged to
stop because the noise became too
great. The pieces which he ren
dered were these: The Toccata of
Verdi, Le Cygne by Saint-Saens,
the Prelude and Fugue by Bach,
a Tanniehauser march, Schubert's
Serenade, and the intermezzo by
Hollins. They were all very much
appreciated and spiritedly ap
plauded by the gathering, which
increased by degrees.
Mr. Eddy, in speaking with a
representative of the Daily Palo
Alto, commented enthusiastically
on the tone of the organ and said
that as an organ it was a wonder
ful piece of work, worthy of its
grand and beautiful home.
Mrs. Jordan was there and con
versed with the organist. She in
vited him to come back to give a
concert. As he was also very ur
gently requested to do so by Mr.
Harris, the maker of the organ in
Los Angeles, he thinks it very prob
able that he will. He says that he
lives six months in this country
and the other half-year in Europe,
making Paris his headquarters.
He has given concerts in all the
large cities of Europe, and concert
izing, as he says, is his business.
Although he does not, as a rule, ac
cept invitations to play in churches,
he thinks favorably on returning
to Stanford to play on March 10th
on his return from Los Angeles.
