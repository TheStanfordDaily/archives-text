# COTILLION TOMORROW.
## National Colors Will Predominate in Decorations in Honor of the Day. 
### 
The Sophomore Cotillion Com
mittee met last evening, and ar
rangements of the annual class
dance are nearing completion. The
sale of tickets so far indicates that
a much larger crowd than usually
goes to this dance will be in at
tendance, and predictions are that
the affair will be the most success
ful of the year. The committee
has adopted some novel schemes of
decorating, and in commemoration
of Washington's birthday the na
tional colors will predominate.
The music will be furnished by
Yanke's Orchestra of eight pieces,
and on account of the fact that
dancing must stop promptly at
midnight, the first number 011 the
program will commence sharply at
eight o'clock. Heretofore the first
piece has been put off long past the
announced time of starting, but
the committee states that this
dance will be an exception, and
that the program will positively be
started on the hour. Tickets for
the dance are on sale at the Hook
store on the campus, and at the
Palace drugstore in Palo Alto. A
great deal of attention has been
given to trie floor in the Encina
club-room lately and it will be in
excellent shape for dancing tomor
row evening. Refreshments will
be served during the eleventh,
twelfth and thirteenth dances.
The list of patronesses is as fol
lows: Mesdames Jordan, Branner,
Still man, Pease, Matzke, Howard,
Wilbur, Storey, Searles, Hodges,
Oilman, Rayson, Mayhew, and
Miss Ely.
The committee that has been in
charge of arrangements for the
Sophomore class is: 1). C. Wiley,
chairman, M. L. Van Norden,o. A.
Wilson, Miss Minnetta Parkhurst,
Miss Evangeline Oossett, H. A.
Sprague, George W. Bernhard.
