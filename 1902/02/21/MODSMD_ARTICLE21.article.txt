The action of the baseball man
agement yesterday in compelling
the Santa Clara team to continue
the game under circumstances
wholly averse to the hitter's suc
cess has occasioned considerable
severe criticism which, it appears,
is entirely merited. The spectacle
presented was anything but cheer
ing to the man who likes to draw
distinctions between the ethical
standards of collegians and pro
fessionals. It is not beyond our
belief that the latter would resort
to any chicanery in order to secure
an advantage, but to find a univer
sity adapting the sa ) e tactics, and
Stanford University at that, is
really painful. That our team was
outplayed from first to last was

evident to the most unenlightened
occupant of the bleachers, and the
machinations by which it was
hoped to increase our score could
well be viewed in a very humorous
light. Just now, however, the mat
ter is a serious one, for it represents
a tendency that must he checked.
To he sure, if we had chanced to tie
the score on account of the inabili
ty of opposing players to handle a
ball too slippery for any mortal to
manipulate skilfully, there was
still another inning for Santa Clara
to retrieve herself, thus making the
chances theoretically even. Hut
that is mere speculation, the point
of the situation being this: Accord
ing to all principles of fair play the
game should have ended when the
Santa Clarans wanted it to endâ€”
at the beginning of the downpour.
That it did not end there was owing
to the stand our officials took. As
it happened, the sco e remained un
changed, but if we had won the
game the Catholic College men
would have gone home with the
bitterest of criticism of the Stanford
attitude. Better that the Univer
sity lose every game of the season
than forfeit its reputation for sports
manship.
