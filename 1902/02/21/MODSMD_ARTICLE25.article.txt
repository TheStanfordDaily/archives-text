# THE 						"ANTIGONE."
## Critical Discussion of the Greek Play to be Given at the University in April. 
### 
A critic, writing in the Toronto
Globe of the approaching presen
tation in that city of the "Antigone"
of Sophocles for the first time in
English, gives the following discus
sion on the play which will be given
in the Assembly Hall next April.
"The influences of the 'Antigone'
play itself are important points.
For one thing, the purity of its eth
ical tone is striking and suggestive.
One cannot help reflecting on the
difference in this respect between
the Attic and the modern drama.
The play 'Antigone' is an eloquent
and powerful sermon. It places
before us characters grand, heroic
and inspiring, and at the same
time it, shows how faults, trivial as
they would seem and quite con
sistent with nobility of soul, may
lead to terribly tragic consequences.
No one could possibly be otherwise
than benefited by this play. It
stirs the tenderest and holiest emo
tions, it prompts to serious and
lofty reflection, and there is posi
tively, throughout the whole play,
no approach to any lower or ignoble
element in human nature. There
would be no need for the declama
tion of preacher against the stage
if the drama were what it was in
the lands of Sophocles.
"The presence and actions of the
chorus seem strange to modern
taste, but of course this is explained
by the development of Attic dra
mas from the religious and purely
musical performances of an earlier
time. Even after the acting was
introduced it was for a. time subor
dinate to the music. By and by it
became the more important of the
two, and the chorus reflected the
action of the play. This is scarcely
in keeping with our modern no
tions of realism. We are painfully
realistic nowadays, and our plays,
like our novels, must, we insist, be
merely copies of what occurs in
real life. The Greeks —what need
to tell it of a race that produced
Plato? —were a nation of idealists,
yet withal practical enough people.
The nicety of the Greek taste ap
pears in many ways in this play.
Not only is there a marked ab
sence of all that is in itself coarse
and vulgar, but even the faintest
suspicion of vulgarity is absent.
There is no free and easy repartee
to come between the heavy parts,
no pandering to questionable taste,
nor rude or indelicate jesting.
"And though the play is a heavy
tragedy, the horror presented on
the stage is purely the intellectual
and moral horror. There are no j
scenes of bloodshed. The actors j
who commit suicide do it off the j
stage. We are robbed even of see- j
ing Haemonsagony--a particularly
telling scene, a moedrn dramatist
would think —when he finds liisj
beloved dead. There is absolutely ]

nothing that could offend the most'
sensitive taste. Yet it does not go
to the other extreme of being disa-!
greeably stiff and proper. It is!
natural, life-like and strong.
"A point that could not escape 1
the audience is noticeable in the
last scene, where Creon is stricken
with grief at the double loss of wife
and son, but it seems strange that;
his grief for his son was much
more intense than that for his
wife. To the Greek, however, the !
ties of blood were infinitely strong
er than the ties of marriage. This
consideration serves to explain An-j
tigone's preferring apparently her j
brother to her lover. She would
not, she expressly says, have done I
what she did for a husband. But j
what would without doubt strike
the modern audience as most sur-1
prising is the absence of love-mak- j
ing on the stage. We aresupposedi
to believe that Antigone and Hae
mon are lovers, hut they have no
interviews on the stage, and there
are no tender passages to interest
the audience in their romance.
Possibl}' it would be interesting to
have just a little —a very little —of
classic love-making, for the purpose
of comparison of ancient and mod
ern methods in this art. But at
any rate it is refreshing to the last
degree to see for once a play which
contrasts so strongly with those in
which the supreme and, in fact,
only, interest centers on the senti
ment of love. This is purely one
of the great merits of 'Antigone' as a
work of art and of refined taste."
