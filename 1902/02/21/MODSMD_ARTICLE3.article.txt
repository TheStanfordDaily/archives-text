The agreement for the two an
nual debates with the University
of Washington was signed today by
M. F. McCormick, J. K. English,
and C. D. McComish, of the Inter
collegiate Debating Committee, and
forwarded to the committee in
charge of affairs in the northern
institution. This is the first step
in the broadening of Stanford's de
bating interests. The first debate
will be held here on May 2, 1902,

practically the same as that pro

minor changes have been made
since negotiations were opened.

judges, was inserted by the Stan
ford committee today. With this
exception, the Washington commit
tee has already approved the arti
cles. The agreement follows:
