The performance of the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra, which re
ceives flattering press notices where
ever it has appeared lately, will he
the chief attraction in the way of
entertainment next week. The con
cert will be in the Assembly Hall

is any profit over the expense of
bringing the aggregation here, the
committee in charge will turn it
into the fund being accumulated to
purchase a new piano for the Assem
b!y Hall.
