# Death of Edwin Starbuck.
## 
### 
At 4 o'clock this morning Edwin
Starbuck, youngest son of Dr. Star
buck of the Education deparment,
passed away. The child was taken
sick with scarlet fever on Sunday,
and the case proved a severe one
from the first. Artificial means
were used for respiration, and on
Thursday night it was expected the
child would live, but early this
morning he took a turn for the
worse, and all hope was abandoned.
The funeral arrangements have not
as yet been made.
