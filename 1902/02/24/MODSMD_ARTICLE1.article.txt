# OPERA A SUCCESS.

### 
Pirates of Penzance Pleased Audi
ence Friday Night.—Second
Performance Postponed.
A capital performance of the
"Pirates of Penzance" was pre
sented in the Assembly Hall Fri
day evening. This opera is one of
the best and most popular of the
Gilbert and Sullivan collabora
tions; and it lost little at the hands
of the local cast. Thorough train
ing and a judicious selection of
principals were evident throughout
the two acts. In spite of the con
tinued dismal weather the audience
was large, every part of the house
being filled except the parabolas of
the balcony.
First credit is due to Mr. Weer,
whose painstaking thoroughness
and absolute understanding of
operatic work made the perform
ance a success. His manner is
very quiet and shows mastery. At
least twice it was necessary for him
to prompt a principal or the chorus,
and his tenor carried the air while
the audience was not aware of the
substitution. The work of prepara
tion has been long and perhaps
tedious.
Among the members of the cast
the success of Mrs. Perry Roberts
was most noteworthy. She possesses
talent as an actress besides a clear
silver soprano voice. As Mabel,
General Stanley's youngest daugh
ter, she was petite and charming.
The air, "Poor Wandering One,"
sung in the first act with chorus,
was very well received. The cun
ning seriousness which Mrs. Roberts
put into the part was distinctly
successful.
C. L. Firebaugh, '04, as king of
the pirate band, displayed a voice
which might be his fortune. The
pirate king solo and the trios of the
second act were sung in a commend
able way.
Dr. G. B. Little, in the part of
Frederick, was pleasing with a
clear, well-trained tenor. His
spoken lines were less successful
than his songs, in which he showed
real dramatic fire, especially in the
duets with Ruth and with Mabel.
Miss Pearl M. Bartlett,'04, carried
well the part of Ruth, which is by
no means an easy one.
The comic side of the opera is
shared by the sergeant and major
general, Case, '02, and Prentice,
'04; each were successful. Prentice
had the most effective costume and
proved himself the cleverest actor
of the evening; while Case, as
leader of the police, took care of the
more clownish details.
R. 10. Warfield, '08, in an unim
portant part showed ability for a
better one and was completely at
ease.
The chorus work was good. That
of the daughters lacked volume,
but was clover. The music and
spirit of the nonsense verse —"How
beautiful blue the sky" was delight
fully feminine. The reply to Fred
erick's request for a maid with poor
complexion was also well given.
The l»est of the "daughters" were
the Misses Shreckhise, Ellerbeck,
Hoitt, Wright, and Kirkpatrick.
Among the villainous looking pir
ate gang, and the police, the best

action whs that of Young, Gay,
Powers, Burton, Nangle, Dudley,
and Stack. The chorus of pirates
and police in the second act was
the best of men's choruses. The
spoken responses in chorus were
rather explosive than spontaneous.
The scenery from the Tivoli was
effective, and the lights were well
handled. Credit is due to Lester N.
Bryte, the stage manager.
Mr. Weer and Manager Edwards
decided this morning not to repro
duce the performance tomorrow
evening, as was announced from
the platform Friday night, and
have postponed it until sometime
next week. This change is made
because of the unfavorable weather,
especially as the second production
will be mainly for the benefit of
people living in surrounding towns.
The cast given below will be the
same in the reproduction, and there
will be no change in the personnel
of the chorus from that previously
published.
