# GOES TO HAWAII.
## Dr. Gilbert Leaves the Latter Part of This Week to Take Charge of Scientific Expedition. 
### 
At the end of this week or the be
ginning of next, Dr. Charles H.
Gilbert, head of the Zoology depart
ment, will start from San Francisco
on his scientific expedition to Ha
waii, to take charge of the United
States Fish Commission work which
was being conducted last year by
Dr. Jordan and Dr. Jenkins. He
will go on the U. S. steamer Alba
tross and make that his home dur
ing his stay of six months, return
ing on it in time for University
work next autumn. He will he ac
companied by Prof. C. C. Nutting,
who is head of the department of
zoology at the University of Iowa;
John O. Snyder, instructor in Zool
ogy here at Stanford; and Walter
K. Fisher, '01, a graduate of that
department.
The party is to make investiga
tions in all branches of natural
history. Professor Nutting will
have general charge of the inverte
brate work, and Mr. Fisher, who
has done considerable work for the
United States Biological Survey,
will probably take charge of the
birds, as he is specially fitted in
that line. The principal part of
the work will be done several hun
dred miles off the islands, among
the deep-sea forms; but parties will
lie left at times to conduct investi
gations along shore.
The Albatross is one of the best
equipped vessels for scientific work
that exist. It is manned by officers
and sailors of the United States
navy, and is devoted entirely to
scientific work. Dr. Gilbert has
made trips on this steamer before.
He was in charge of work along the
coast of Southern California and in
the Gulf of California, and at an
other time spent five months with
it in Bering Sea.
