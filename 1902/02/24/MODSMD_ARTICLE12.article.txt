### 
The Olympic Club won the four
mile cros√ü-country run in Golden
Gate Park Saturday by eight sec
onds, from the Oakland high
school team. Lund) 7 , an Oakland
boy, made the best time, tying the
record of 23:01 made last year,
when Stanford brought home the
trophy cup. E. W. Smith, Stan
ford '99, of the Olympic team,
made second-best time, finishing in
23:40. This is a remarkable show
ing when it is considered that he
had had no training, and had been
working until 3 o'clock that morn
ing at his desk in the Chronicle
news-room. In his senior year
Smith was editor-in-chief and busi
ness manager of the Daily Palo
Alto, and captain of the Varsity
track team.
