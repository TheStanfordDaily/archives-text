The chapel sermon was delivered
Sunday by Dr. Halsey of the Eco
nomics department. Under the

title "The Heavenly Vision" he dis
cussed the aspects of a spiritual
awakening such as comes once in a
lifetime to every man. He com
pared the decision of Saul of Tarsus
and his sudden change of life, to
moral or spiritual repentance which
sanctities a soul at any time or
place. This awakening, he said,
must come to all who follow or testi
fy to the doctrine of Jesus Christ, and
sanctified acts will flow naturally
from such a revival of faith.
