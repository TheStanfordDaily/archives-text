# THE
						SOPHOMORE PARTY.
## Large Crowd Attended the Cotillion Saturday Night.—Handsome Decorations. 
### 
Patriotic decorations, a good floor,
excellent music, careful prepara
tion of every detail, and an unpre
cedented attendance made the
Sophomore Cotillion Saturday night
a thorough success. About one
hundred and thirty couples were
there, including many from outside
the University, and the crowd ex
ceeded what had been anticipated.
The committee kept its promise to
have the music begin at eight
o'clock, and the dancers were as
sembled on time. Promptly at the
hour announced, Yanke's orchestra
struck up an overture, and when a
few minutes later the first two-step
began, the floor of Encina club
room was nearly filled.
Suspended from the four corners
across to the middle of the room
were crepe paper streamers of red,
white, and blue, in honor [of the
birth of Washington, and the
national colors predominated every
where; while around the wall at
intervals stood handsome palms
and plants Just above the fire
place at the end of the hall was a
big "'O4" of electric lights with a
cardinal background, combining
the class numerals and the Varsity
colors. From the chandeliers hung
Japanese lanterns. The corners
were cosily supplied with couches
and rugs, and the patronesses,
Mrs. Branner, Mrs. Stillman, Mrs.
Pease, Mrs. Matzke, Mrs. Wilbur,
Mrs. Storey, Mrs. Searles, Mrs.
Hodges, Mrs. Gilman, Mrs. Layson,
Mrs. May hew, and Miss Ely occu
pied the recess at the right of the
fireplace. The lights were more
subdued with color shades than
at any previous dance, and the
effect, on the crowded floor of
dancers and the exquisite gowns of
the ladies, was beautiful and pleas
ing. The committee had done its
work well, and altogether the dec
orations were handsome and appro
priate.
The program, designed by O. K.
Studley, '03, represented a stein
with a portion of the Sophomore
class yell, "We roar, Stanford," on
the rim at the top. The numerals
04, were just above the last three
words of each line of the Sophomore
stanza from "One, two, three, four,"
the opening words apparently being
hidden by the curvature of the sur
face. The design had been sug
gested by the line, "The sophomore
blows from his tankard the foam."
By this quotation was the picture
of a knight with spurs and helmet
holding a stein in his lap, and at
the base of the cover-leaf was the
inscription "Sophomore Cotillion,
Encina Hall, Feb. 22, 1902."
Dancing ceased a few minutes be
fore midnight, and the lights went
out before all the guests had left the
building.
