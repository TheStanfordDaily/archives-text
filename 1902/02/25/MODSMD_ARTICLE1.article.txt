# PROGRAM FOR CONCERT.
## Feast of Music to Be Given in Assembly Hall Thursday Afternoon. 
### 
A musical treat is looked for on
Thursday afternoon, when the Chi
cago Symphony Orchestra appears
in the Assembly Hall. The pro
gram has been arranged by Dr.
(joe be], and it is one which holds
more than a little promise of pleas
ure. The choicest there is in music
has been chosen, the selections
holding plenty of possibilities for
line work.
That these possibilities will all
be utilized and that the concert
will be one of the very best ever
given here is evidenced by the
high place which the Chicago Sym
phony Orchestra occupies in the
world of music. The appearance
of the orchestra in San Francisco
is looked upon as a great musical
event, the tickets having been sold
out in advance; and in San Jose
the amount necessary to secure the
concert has been subscribed for al
most twice, so great is the interest
in the concert.
Following is the program:
Overture, "Leonore," No. 3
Beethoven
Violin Concerto Wieniawsky
Mr. Van Oordt
Symphony (unfinished). ..Schubert
Les Preludes Liszt
Roses from the South Strauss
