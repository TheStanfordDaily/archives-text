# "Sequoia" Is Out.
## 
### 
The Sequoia appeared today and
is a number of especial interest.
The principal stories, "The Key of
the Krachenfels," l>y Mary Lucile
Caldwell, and "A Heart Solo," by
Sue O'Brannon Porter, are both of
unusual merit, lacking the crinle
ness and amateurishness so often
seen in college fiction. Ike Russell
has some swinging lines in"The

Pathoß of Glory, "while an exquisite
verse, entitled "To Japan," is con
tributed by K. Koda, a Stanford
student whose home is in the Is
land Empire. "In Florem Sepis,"
by R. Giorgio; "A Prospective
Trip," by Ed Gil man; "Found —a
Locket," by Alice Aileen Higgins;
and the Sketch-book, complete one
of the most substantially good
numbers yet issued.
