Work in Oratory.—An effort is
going to be made to form an ora
torical association at Stanford. The
purpose of the organization is to
drill men to become efficient pub
lic speakers, to furnish a thorough
training for future oratorical con
tests, and to give an adequate prep
aration to those who wish to try
for intercollegiate debating teams
in future years. The idea for the
present is to put the association on
a firm basis, so as to be ready to
receive new incoming students next
year. Those interested are request
ed to come to room 23 next Friday,
February 28th, at 4:30, and discuss
plans for the work.
