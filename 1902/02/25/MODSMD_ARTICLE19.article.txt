An interesting condition of our
finances is presented by the treas
urer's report published today.
With a surplus above liabilities of
only about two hundred dollars to
meet the heavy expense of baseball,
track, and tennis during the spring,
it looks as if we shall have a large)'
deficit than usual at the end of the
second semester. Treasurer Ed
wards' appeal for the students to
co-operate with the management
deserves to be heeded. More than
one hundred dollars will be added
from the receipts of the Pirates of
Penzance, and it is hoped that a
substantial income may be realized
from the campus baseball games
and track tournaments.
