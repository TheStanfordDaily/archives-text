# Coming Tennis Tournaments.
## 
### 
A tennis tournament of singles
will be held on next Saturday,
and one of doubles on the Satur
day following, March Bth. The en
trance fee will be the same as
usual, both for the singles and
doubles. The try-out for positions
on the Intercollegiate team will
probably he held somewhat earlier
in the season than last year, as the
men to represent Stanford will need
considerable practice upon good
courts, and some of the players
may object to the trouble of going
to San Jose or San Francisco with
out assurance of the fact that they
will meet California.
