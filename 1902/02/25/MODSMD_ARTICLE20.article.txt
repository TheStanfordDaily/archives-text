Captain McCaughekn's sum
mary dismissal from the track
team of men who have violated
training rules will meet with strong
approval from the student body.
It is merely putting in force the
policy announced at the beginning
of the season, which must be rigidly
observed if we are to succeed in
building up a strong track team at
Stanford. Heretofore there has
been a lamentable failure to en
force the rules, upon the one hand,

and a disgusting lack of regard for the
binding nature of a pledge solemn
ly given, upon the other. Those
who agree to follow training reg
ulations may feel that they are
making some sacrifice, but they do
so voluntarily and are bound to
suffer the consequences of deliber
ate violation. They have led the
student body, the captain, and the
trainer to expect the best work pos
sible from them, and this requires
observance of the simple rules laid
down for physical welfare. The
sooner it is considered a disgrace
to break this pledge, the sooner
shall we have wholesome conditions
in our athletics.
