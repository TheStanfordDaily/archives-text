# Hay and "The Love Sonnets."
## 
### 
In acknowledging the receipt of
a copy of Wallace Irwin's "Love
Sonnets of a Hoodlum," Secretary
of State Hav recently said, accor
ing to the Chronicle:
"I have received the Love Sonnets
and read it through. Indeed, I
do not see how any one could lay
it down without finishing it. It is
an astonishing tour de force. A
man who could do that could do
almost anything he tried. J am
greatly obliged to you for letting
me see such an interesting and up
to-date piece of work." It may be
of interest to note that over 12,000
copies of the little book have been
sold.
