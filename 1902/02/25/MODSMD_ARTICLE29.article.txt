## Says Officials Merely Adhered to the Rules in Game With Santa Clara. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
On account of a misunderstand
ing of the rules of the game, some
of the people present at Thursday's
game with Santa Clara may have
gotten a false impression of the
action of the officials and the
team. 1 would like to state the
rules of the officials and the Stan
ford team.
The following appeared in Fri
day's issue of the Palo Alto: "Ac
cording to all principles of fair play
the game should have ended when
the Santa Clarans wanted it to
end —at the beginning of the down
pour. That it did not end there
was owing to the stand our officials
took. . . . Better that the
University lose every game
of the season than forfeit its rep
utation for sportsmanship."
In terminating a game on ac
ocount of rain, the umpire is gov
erned by the following rule: Rule
64, Baseball Guide, "The umpire
shall suspend play for the follow
ing causes: First, if rain is falling so
heavily as to oblige the spectators
on the open field and open stands
to seek shelter, in which case he
shall note the time of suspension;
and should rain fall continuously
for thirty minutes thereafter he
shall terminate the game.''
The officials carried out this rule.
When the spectators sought shelter
the game was suspended, but it
could not 'mated for thirty
minutes n'» -mi • : nsion. After
five or six if .en ton the
rain subaid* n game was
re • . "d. T . the ninth
with > men to be
put out before it would constitute a
full game. The Santa Clarans had
nothing to lose by playing out the
game, which took less than five
minutes, and thereby saved a sus
pension and wait of thirty min
utes. They well knew if Stanford
had tied the score before they were
able to put out the remaining two
men, the rain continuing, the offi
cials would be compelled to suspend
the game for thirty minutes, and
the score would have related back
to the eighth inning, the last even
inning played. They would have
won the game just the same, and
our runs of the ninth inning would
not have counted.
1 think the Stanford men showed
the spirit of true sportsmanship
when they did not insist upon tiie
game being suspended in the fifth
inning. In that inning, with one
man out, some of the spectators
sought shelter at the Inn, and the
Stanford team could have insisted
that the game be suspended, and if
the rain continued for thirty min
utes it would have been scored "no
game," as five innings must be
played to constitute a game. This
was appreciated by the Santa Clara
men, as we continued to play until
they put the third man out, com
pleting the five innings, and made
victory certain for them.
Ciias. J. Swindells, Coach.
