# Track Work Handicapped.

Cinders were spread on the track
hint week hut up to the present
time luive proved of little benefit
to the athletes. The intention of
the management was to spread
them and then by rolling to mash
them into the clay, thus forming

the desired consistency. The cin
ders alone are much too light and
dusty to he "fast," and of no service
whatever. The big roller, which
for a number of weeks has not had
a team attached to it more than
once or twice, would have put the
stretch into good condition with
a half-hour's additional work.
But the roller could not be ob
tained without permission, and
permission could not be obtained
even after a surprising process of
"red tape." The consequence is
that the track is unrolled. The
men have putin their time in un
satisfactory work on the turf and
mud back of the gymnasium.
Trainer Moulton is disgusted
with the turn of affairs, since it is
impossible for him to make any
kind of progress, ban iicapped as
he is. There is a better spirit
among the track men than has
ever before been witnessed at Stan
ford. They are willing to work,
they have the greatest confidence
in the trainer, yet the long contin
uance of such conditions against
which they have been compelled to
fight so far this season would
sorely try the spirit in any
team. Manager Edwards, since the
failure to secure the roller be
longing to the University, has been
endeavoring to procure another.
Up to the present time he has been
unable to do so, but will have one
by the time the track is dry enough
to permit the use of horses upon it.
