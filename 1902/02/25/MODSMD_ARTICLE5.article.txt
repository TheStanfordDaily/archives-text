# Enforcing Training Rules.
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The attitude of myself and the
trainer, Mr. Moulton, in regard to
the keeping of training rules?, in too
well known to admit of any argu
ment. If I am rightly informed,
in previous years men have repeat
edly been allowed to break the
rules and were still kept on
the team. This is something
we have refused to consid
er for a moment. A man is
either in training or not, and we
will not be bothered by anyone who
will not live up to those rules
which, by his appearance on the
track, he agrees to observe. The
need of the present communication
is that some few of the track men
seem to think that the matter of
training in a bluff on our part. I
want it clearly understood that J
will do my duty in this regard.
As to publishing the names of those
whom we choose to drop—l con
sider it effective. Up to the pres
ent time 1 have found a fine spirit
among the men, and training rules
have, I think, been well regarded
by all. I have been compelled to
drop l>nt one man, Mr. Hampson,
for infringement of rules.
