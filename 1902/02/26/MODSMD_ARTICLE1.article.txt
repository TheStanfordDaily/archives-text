# BASEBALL PROSPECTS.
## Work Retarded by Wet Weather The Men Who Are Trying for Positions. 
### 
Baseball practice was carried on
Monday afternoon, notwithstanding
the miserable condition of the field.
Infield work was done, hut there
was no game between the first and
second nines. The frequent heavy
rains of the last few days have put
the men back a great deal. The
wet season has been more of a
handicap this year than ever be
fore, on account of the great num
ber of new men who are trying for
places. The chances for develop
ing any great amount of team work
have been materially lessened, and
in this particular the University
of California has an advantage.
Its team is composed almost en
tirely of old and experienced Var
sity men who are used to playing
with each other, and more time
can be given there to the develop
ment of the main points of the
game. If the present rains con
tinue our chances in the intercol
legiate contests will be considerably
decreased.
The first contest with the Uni
versity of California is less than
five weeks off, and so far only three
practice games have been held,
whereas there would have been
eight or ten under ordinary circum
stances. It is very evident, then,
that the intervening time between
now and the opening contest will
need to be used to great advantage.
However, the marked improve
ment in the men since the first
game with Santa Clara College is
gratifying to the coach and student
body. The throwing has been bet
tered, and the several ''dumb"
plays that characterized that match
have been done away with. Indi
vidually the Stanford players are
improving right along, and if their
team-work can be advanced to the
same degree in the next few weeks
there can be no doubt but that
a high-class game of ball will be
put up by the Varsity when it
meets California. The outlook at
the present verifies Coach Swin
dell's statement made early in the
season that the 1902 Varsity would
be an average Stanford team. Be
hind the bat McGiivray has been
doing some good work. He is im
proving right along, and is a
strong, accurate thrower to bases.
There is a chance for him to better
himself in running, as he does not
work hard enough when he gets on
base.
The pitchers have not had much
of a chance to show their true
value. The bad weather has pre
vented them from getting their
arms into condition and from de
veloping good control of the ball.
Tritch gave an exhibition of great
form in the Alumni game a few
weeks ago, but in the match with
Santa Clara College on last Thurs
day he had an off-day. Barker
and McFarland will be tried in the
next game. In any event, there
will he a very close competition be
tween the three men, and the one
who starts in the first intercollegi
ate will have to work hard for the
place.
The race for the initial bag has

changed a great deal. Lowenthal,
Blake, and Traegerhave been tried,
but the latter has not been out
much. Blake seems to be the best
candidate at this time. He plays
the bag well, but his batting has
been rather weak. Blake is an ag
gressive player, is in the game all
the time, and is a hard, conscien
tious worker.
Captain Cowden has shown his
fine old form. He is fielding and
hitting well, and is without doubt
the most reliable hitter on the
nine.
Brown has not yet developed his
last year's form at the bat, but he
is the fastest and best base-runner
on the field. His fielding has been
good, although third base is a new
position for him, as he was in the
outfield last season.
Crawford is improving each day
in every department of the game.
He is a good, hard worker, has a
fast arm, and plays a tine, deep
shortstop.
The outfield is practically a new
one, Copp and Knight having had
no experience on the Varsity.
Lowenthal and Knight are hitting
well, while Copp is easily the star
fielder, though not so strong at the
bat. Kellogg has been doing good
work, and has excellent chances
for a place in the outfield. Row
land has but recently come out.
He has done some good pitching,
and may be called on to show what
he can do in the box. Hayden,
Grider, Ballagh, Dougherty, Trow
bridge, and others have been doing
well on the second team, and have
a good chance for the Varsity.
The next game to be played will
be on the campus tomorrow after
noon with the San Jose Profession
als, providing the weather permits.
The game between the Stanford
Freshmen and the Cooper Medical
Freshmen, scheduled for Monday
afternoon, was postponed indefi
nitely.

tious worker.
Captain Cowden has shown his
fine old form. He is fielding and
hitting well, and is without doubt
the most reliable hitter on the
nine.
Brown has not yet developed his
last year's form at the bat, but he
is the fastest and best base-runner
on the field. His fielding has been
good, although third base is a new
position for him, as he was in the
outfield last season.
Crawford is improving each day
in every department of the game.
He is a good, hard worker, has a
fast arm, and plays a tine, deep
shortstop.
The outfield is practically a new
one, Copp and Knight having had
no experience on the Varsity.
Lowenthal and Knight are hitting
well, while Copp is easily the star
fielder, though not so strong at the
bat. Kellogg has been doing good
work, and has excellent chances
for a place in the outfield. Row
land has but recently come out.
He has done some good pitching,
and may be called on to show what
he can do in the box. Hayden,
Grider, Ballagh, Dougherty, Trow
bridge, and others have been doing
well on the second team, and have
a good chance for the Varsity.
The next game to be played will
be on the campus tomorrow after
noon with the San Jose Profession
als, providing the weather permits.
The game between the Stanford
Freshmen and the Cooper Medical
Freshmen, scheduled for Monday
afternoon, was postponed indefi
nitely.
