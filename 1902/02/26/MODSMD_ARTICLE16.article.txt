# U.C. Notes.

### 
—California will not meet Har
vard on the Eastern trip, owing to
the latter's inability to arrange a
date that would not interfere with
the annual Harvard-Vale meet.
—Saturday was observed as
Women's Day at the University of
California. Tennis and basket
ball, a farce in the afternoon, and
a dance in the evening, were the
order of the day.
—California, Wisconsin, Yale,
and Pennsylvania will enter the
four-mile relay race for the college
championship at Philadelphia in
April. A. C. Flaw, U. C. '02, who
recently made a practice throw of
187 feet, will meet champion John
Flanagan in a special hammer
throw at the same meet.
