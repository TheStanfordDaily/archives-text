# Harvard Interclass Debating.
## 
### 
The interclass debating system
at Harvard has been changed, to
he conducted hereafter as follows,
according to the Harvard Crimson:
"Each of the four class clubs will
in future hold three debates each
month. These debates will be con
ducted under the present system,
but at the conclusion of each the
club will choose by vote the best
speaker in the debate. The three
men thus chosen each month will
form a team to debate with a simi
lar team from another class; and
the two winners will debate for the
interclass championship. In this
manner, by the holding of monthly
interclass debates, it is expected
that a more active interest in the
club meetings will arise."
