# President Roosevelt and Football.
## 
### 
President Roosevelt is quoted as
saying in regard to his son's recent
illness:
''Ted is strong and rugged, or he
couldn't have shown this wonderful
improvement. He had a little ac
cident here last fall when lie broke
his collarbone playing football, but
that is nothing. His mother was
rather glad that it happened, 1
think, as it showed him what to
expect."
