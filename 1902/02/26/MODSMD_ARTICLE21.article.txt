The students of Kansas Univer
sity and of Baker University are
engaged in a violent discussion as
to which acted the worse at a re
cent debate between the two institu
tions held at Lawrence, says the
Daily Nebraska,!),, it appears from
the evidence that a good deal of
rowdyism was prevalent on both
sides.
The editor of the Kansas Weekly
hurls this at the heads of the Baker
ites as a parting shot:
"Perhaps Baker realized that, by
some strange fore ordination of
fate, it required only the addition
of the simple letter "m" to her init
ials "B. U.'' to perfectly character
ize her work and outside reputation,
her vaunted, tumid self-esteem
might subside, and recognizing her
own petty position, cease to slime
the greatest institution of the
Middle West."
