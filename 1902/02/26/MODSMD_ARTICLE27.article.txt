# Work Being Rushed.
## 
### 
Things are rapidly being made
ready for the dedication of the
Memorial Church March 9th. Only
three images remained this after
noon to be placed in position near
the altar, and the pews are already
putin the gallery, while the main
floor will be seated as soon as the
tile work is completed. By the end
of this week the carpenters will
have finished all the wood work.
The clock was started again today,
and the damage done to the cross
and the roof of the steeple by the
storm yesterday will be repaired at
once. A large tarpaulin thrown
over the organ protected the big in
strument from being damaged by
the rain which penetrated a leak
above the gallery.
