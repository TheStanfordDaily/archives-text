# GROWTH OF HANDBALL.
## How the Sport Has Developed Here at Stanford, and Its Popularity. Intercollegiate Possibilities. 
### 
There is probably no sport which
has grown into popularity so quick
ly or has taken so great a hold on
the average student as handball.
The courts in Encina Gymnasium,
makeshift though they are, are con
stantly in use. Students, strong or
weak, agile or slow, derive the
same pleasure from the game.
Handball was first introduced in
the Roble Gymnasium in the spring
of 1899. Seeing the popularity of
the sport, Mr. Storey moved the
apparatus from the corner of En
cina Gymnasium to the gallery
and marked off a court. From the
very first the game had enthusi
astic supporters, and good players
rapidly developed.
Soon the windows were painted
and protected by wire screens.
The court was enlarged, but was
still inadequate, so more appa
ratus was moved and a smaller one
was made in the opposite corner of
the Gymnasium, during the Christ
mas vacation of 1899. The accom
modations were still insufficient
for the large number who wished to
play. At Christinas, 1900, a third
court was constructed in the main
hall by means of a heavy swinging
4oor. This court has three walls,
and though small develops quick
ness of eye and muscle.
In order to organize the sport
and put it on some recognized ba
sis, an interclass tournament was
held in the spring of 1901. There
were many entries, and some good
exhibitions of the game were seen.
After the class championships had
been decided, — Marks for 1902,
Frisselle for 1903, and Dunn for
1904, —the winners played for the
championship of the Univorsity.
Dunn won, with Frisselle, '03, YV.
\V. Copp, '03, Gundrum, '03, and
Raitt, '03, following close. Then
doubles were held, in which Gun
drum and Raitt, a '03 team, won
the champiotiship.
A carved leather belt, silver
mounted, with the name of the
winner, the date, and the tourna
ment carved on the mountings, was
presented to the winner by the
Gymnasium. It is intended that
the belt be contested for six times,
and that each time a silver plate be
engraved with the winner's name
on. Then the belt will be hung in
the trophy room. A second tour
nament is now in progress. The
influence of practice is seen in the
improved games. Dunn, '04, the
present holder of the belt, will, in
all probability, carry off the cham
pionship honors.
Moved by repeated urging from
the University of California, the
Executive Committee this year de
cided to have an Intercollegiate
contest on the same basis as tennis.
For some unknown reason, the
University of California suddenly
lost interest; and it is now too late
to hold a recognized intercollegiate
contest. However, an informal one
may be arranged.
The possibility of handball be
coming an intercollegiate event
brings forward the sad lack of
courts. There is no regulation

court nearer than San Mateo. This
would cause much inconvenience
in practice. It is hoped by the en
thusiasts that in the near future
there will be a new gymnasium fit
ted with a sufficient number of reg
ulation courts to accommodate the
demand.
Handball in connection with the
regular Gymnasium work is as
signed to the sections at regular in
tervals so as to interpose spicy
work between the more irksome.
The courts are always in use, and
tlie students look forward with a
great deal of eagerness to the
period when their sections are as
signed. In this way every student
in the Gymnasium gets a chance
to play.
Handball has been and iH very
popular among other universities.
Columbia has ten courts, Wiscon
sin has an entire floor in her gym
nasium devoted to ihe game, and
Michigan also has several courts.
