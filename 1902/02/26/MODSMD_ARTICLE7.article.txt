A leter in regard to the proposed
handball tournament was received
from Berkeley yesterday. It seems
that there has been difficulty to get
the California Intercollegiate Ath
letic Committee to act on the
matter, owing to the fact that the
question was not submitted in time
to be considered at the annual
meeting January 30th. There was
no mention of a tournament made
at that meeting, and the committee
did not think proper to act until
hearing from the Stanford commit
tee officially. In view of this fact,
the letter proposes that negotiations
be opened from the Stanford end
of the line. This will undoubtedly
be done, but there is little chance
of holding the meet this semester,
owing to the time already lost.
