# THE 						ANTIGONE MYTH.
## Story About Which Is Woven the Greek Opera to Be Given Here in the Near Future. 
### 
As the time for the production of
"Antigone" draws nearer interest
in it increases, and more than a
little curiosity as to just what it
will be like is prevalent through
out the student body. The mem
bers of the Greek department are
the only ones who know very much
about the opera, the rest of the stu
dents having only a faint knowl
edge of its characteristics and pos
sibilities.
The myth of which Antigone is
the last chapter deals with the
working out of the oracle of Apollo,
which stated that the son of Laius,
King of Thebes, should kill his
father and marry his mother.
When the son (Edipus was born,
he was exposed to die; but a herds
man saved him and gave him to
the King of Corinth, who raised
the boy as his own son. The ora
cle was disclosed to the boy, who,
to avoid it, set out from his adopted
home. On the road he met his
father and slew him. He jour
neyed on to Thebes and, killing
the sphinx which was devastating
the*land, set himself up as tyrant.
After many years of prosperous
reign, during which several chil
dren were born to him, a plague
beset the land. Teiresias, the
soothsayer, made known that the
murderer of Laius must be driven,
out, if the land was to be prosper
ous again. (Edipus found out
that he was the dread pollutor, and
in the agony of his remorse tore
out his eyes with the clasp from
the belt of his wife and mother.
He went into exile, attended by his
daughter Antigone. After (Edipus
came to his end, his two sons, Poly
nices and Eteocles, agreed to rule
for alternate years. But Eteocles
refused to give up the kingdom
when his year was up. Polynices
left the country and gathering to
gether a great army returned to at
tack his native city. The two
brothers killed each other in single
combat.
This brings the myth to the
opening of the Antigone.
An abstract of the play, taken
from Prof. Lewis Campbell's book
on Sophocles, follows:
Opening —Antigone declares to
Ismene in grey dawn, her purpose
of burying Polynices in defiance of
Creon. Ismene vainly expostu
lates. Antigone goes forth to pour
libation. Ismene retires disheart
ened.
The chorus of Theban elders en
ters, chanting the triumph of
Thebes over Argos. They speak of
the fratricidal war of the two
princes, rejoice that the war is
ended, and await the proclamation
of them w king. Creon enters and,
to prove 11is patriotism, forbids the
burial i»f Polynices, the traitor.
The elders are surprised, hut do
not remonstrate.
One of the watchmen set to
watch the body enters and reports
that some unknown person lnis vio
lated the edict and that the corpse
has received symbolic burial. The
chorus thinks that the gods have
interposed. Creon is in a rage at

the rebellious act and with the sus-!
picion of a mutinous spirit among
the elders. Me threatens the
watchmen with death if they do
not apprehend the malefactor.
The stage is vacant and the cho
rus descant on the mysteries of
human nature.
The watchman returns, bringing
in Antigone. Creon enters from
the palace and the watchman re
ports. Creon is at first amazed,
but when Antigone avows her deed,
he becomes enraged. This is
heightened by her fearless appeal
from human laws to divine. He
threatens her and Ismene, the sis
ter, whom he' accuses with com
plicity, with death.
Antigone prefers death to fur
ther converse with the tyrant.
The people and Eteocles, now that
he is dead, approve the deed. Her
part is not with hatred but with
love.
Ismene enters and tries to share
the responsibility, but Antigone re
jects her with scorn. Creon breaks
in on them with impatient con
tempt. Ismene reminds him that
it is his son's betrothed bride he
intends to slay. The maidens are
led within, Creon remaining upon
the stage.
The chorus sings of the sad fate
of the royal house whose last hope
if. fading away, and of the infatua
tion of human passion. They are
thinking of Antigone, but will soon
have to apply the words to Creon.
Haemon enters and gently ex
postulates with his father. Hae
mon not only shows his own love
for Antigone but makes it felt how
her action and her condemnation
for it had moved the hearts of the
people. This exasperates Creon the
more. Haemon goes forth in omin
ous silence. Creon declares his
purpose more particularly. Anti
gone is to be immured.
The aged chorus marvel at the
power of love such as Haemon's,
which can transport the soul so as
to defy authority, and yet they are
almost moved to pity. For Anti
gone is brought in guarded and
complains in lyric verse. The
chorus at first offers barren conso
lation and finally still more bar
ren reproof.
Antigone then apostrophises her
living tomb and anticipates her
meeting with those who have gone
before. She demands for Creon a
doom not worse than hers.
As she is led away the chorus
sing of the similar fate of Danae
and Lycurgus.
Unexpectedly, the blind old
prophet, Teiresias, comes and tells
the truth to Creon. At first the
seer's recital of portents only en
rages the king. Hut his circum
stantial prophecy of the personal
calamities and the dangers to the
State which attend upon the act
which is :«11 but aoc'.mplished,
Creon is struck with sudden con
viction, and hastens forth if possi
ble to revoke the deed. At this
moment, which is the chief turning
point of the drama, the chorus
utter a wild prayer to Dionysius to
come and save his favorite
city from the pollution threatened
by the seer.
But it is too late. One of those
who had gone forth with Creon re

ports that Haemon is dead. At
this news, Eurydice, the wife of
Creon, comes from the palace and
the messenger tells her how, after
first burying Polynices, they had
gone to the vault where Antigone
had already taken her own life.
Even Haemon's haste had not pre
vented this, and he was lamenting
over her when his father came. On
being entreated to come forth Hae
mon threatened his father with his
sword. Creon escaped and the
youth thrusts the sword into his
own side. Eurydice goes forth
silently and the messenger follows
her. Creon enters with Haemon's
body in his arms, and laments his
fatal error. His lamentation is in
terrupted by the announcement
that Eurydice had taken her own
life, after cursing him. At this
Creon's lament is redoubled, and
he is led off in desolation and de
spair.

in Antigone. Creon enters from
the palace and the watchman re
ports. Creon is at first amazed,
but when Antigone avows her deed,
he becomes enraged. This is
heightened by her fearless appeal
from human laws to divine. He
threatens her and Ismene, the sis
ter, whom he' accuses with com
plicity, with death.
Antigone prefers death to fur
ther converse with the tyrant.
The people and Eteocles, now that
he is dead, approve the deed. Her
part is not with hatred but with
love.
Ismene enters and tries to share
the responsibility, but Antigone re
jects her with scorn. Creon breaks
in on them with impatient con
tempt. Ismene reminds him that
it is his son's betrothed bride he
intends to slay. The maidens are
led within, Creon remaining upon
the stage.
The chorus sings of the sad fate
of the royal house whose last hope
if. fading away, and of the infatua
tion of human passion. They are
thinking of Antigone, but will soon
have to apply the words to Creon.
Haemon enters and gently ex
postulates with his father. Hae
mon not only shows his own love
for Antigone but makes it felt how
her action and her condemnation
for it had moved the hearts of the
people. This exasperates Creon the
more. Haemon goes forth in omin
ous silence. Creon declares his
purpose more particularly. Anti
gone is to be immured.
The aged chorus marvel at the
power of love such as Haemon's,
which can transport the soul so as
to defy authority, and yet they are
almost moved to pity. For Anti
gone is brought in guarded and
complains in lyric verse. The
chorus at first offers barren conso
lation and finally still more bar
ren reproof.
Antigone then apostrophises her
living tomb and anticipates her
meeting with those who have gone
before. She demands for Creon a
doom not worse than hers.
As she is led away the chorus
sing of the similar fate of Danae
and Lycurgus.
Unexpectedly, the blind old
prophet, Teiresias, comes and tells
the truth to Creon. At first the
seer's recital of portents only en
rages the king. Hut his circum
stantial prophecy of the personal
calamities and the dangers to the
State which attend upon the act
which is :«11 but aoc'.mplished,
Creon is struck with sudden con
viction, and hastens forth if possi
ble to revoke the deed. At this
moment, which is the chief turning
point of the drama, the chorus
utter a wild prayer to Dionysius to
come and save his favorite
city from the pollution threatened
by the seer.
But it is too late. One of those
who had gone forth with Creon re

ports that Haemon is dead. At
this news, Eurydice, the wife of
Creon, comes from the palace and
the messenger tells her how, after
first burying Polynices, they had
gone to the vault where Antigone
had already taken her own life.
Even Haemon's haste had not pre
vented this, and he was lamenting
over her when his father came. On
being entreated to come forth Hae
mon threatened his father with his
sword. Creon escaped and the
youth thrusts the sword into his
own side. Eurydice goes forth
silently and the messenger follows
her. Creon enters with Haemon's
body in his arms, and laments his
fatal error. His lamentation is in
terrupted by the announcement
that Eurydice had taken her own
life, after cursing him. At this
Creon's lament is redoubled, and
he is led off in desolation and de
spair.
As the time for the production of
"Antigone" draws nearer interest
in it increases, and more than a
little curiosity as to just what it
will be like is prevalent through
out the student body. The mem
bers of the Greek department are
the only ones who know very much
about the opera, the rest of the stu
dents having only a faint knowl
edge of its characteristics and pos
sibilities.
The myth of which Antigone is
the last chapter deals with the
working out of the oracle of Apollo,
which stated that the son of Laius,
King of Thebes, should kill his
father and marry his mother.
When the son (Edipus was born,
he was exposed to die; but a herds
man saved him and gave him to
the King of Corinth, who raised
the boy as his own son. The ora
cle was disclosed to the boy, who,
to avoid it, set out from his adopted
home. On the road he met his
father and slew him. He jour
neyed on to Thebes and, killing
the sphinx which was devastating
the*land, set himself up as tyrant.
After many years of prosperous
reign, during which several chil
dren were born to him, a plague
beset the land. Teiresias, the
soothsayer, made known that the
murderer of Laius must be driven,
out, if the land was to be prosper
ous again. (Edipus found out
that he was the dread pollutor, and
in the agony of his remorse tore
out his eyes with the clasp from
the belt of his wife and mother.
He went into exile, attended by his
daughter Antigone. After (Edipus
came to his end, his two sons, Poly
nices and Eteocles, agreed to rule
for alternate years. But Eteocles
refused to give up the kingdom
when his year was up. Polynices
left the country and gathering to
gether a great army returned to at
tack his native city. The two
brothers killed each other in single
combat.
This brings the myth to the
opening of the Antigone.
An abstract of the play, taken
from Prof. Lewis Campbell's book
on Sophocles, follows:
Opening —Antigone declares to
Ismene in grey dawn, her purpose
of burying Polynices in defiance of
Creon. Ismene vainly expostu
lates. Antigone goes forth to pour
libation. Ismene retires disheart
ened.
The chorus of Theban elders en
ters, chanting the triumph of
Thebes over Argos. They speak of
the fratricidal war of the two
princes, rejoice that the war is
ended, and await the proclamation
of them w king. Creon enters and,
to prove 11is patriotism, forbids the
burial i»f Polynices, the traitor.
The elders are surprised, hut do
not remonstrate.
One of the watchmen set to
watch the body enters and reports
that some unknown person lnis vio
lated the edict and that the corpse
has received symbolic burial. The
chorus thinks that the gods have
interposed. Creon is in a rage at

the rebellious act and with the sus-!
picion of a mutinous spirit among
the elders. Me threatens the
watchmen with death if they do
not apprehend the malefactor.
The stage is vacant and the cho
rus descant on the mysteries of
human nature.
