A movement is reported to be on
foot at California looking to (he
establishment of an Intercollegiate
Freshman Debate between the two
1
universities. The subject has not
been discussed at Stanford for
some time, and, in view of the other
contests already scheduled and the
lateness of the year, it is doubtful
if anything can be accomplished
during the present semester. Such
a debate, however, if held in the
fall, might serve the same purpose
in stimulating interest that the
Freshman football game does in
athletics.
