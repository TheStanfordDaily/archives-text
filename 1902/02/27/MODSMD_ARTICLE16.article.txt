# Disagreement at California.
## 
### 
A conflict is on between the Cali
fornia executive committee and
the Daily Californian over the
question of reward for the football
men. It has been the custom to
present an emblem to each member
of the Varsity at the close of every
season. This year the executive

committee ruled that a man who
had played on former varsity
teams, and had, therefore, already
received an emblem, should not he
given another. This, in the opinion
of the editor of the Calif or nian, is
false economy in the extreme.
