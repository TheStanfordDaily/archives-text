The try-outs for positions on the
Intercollegiate tennis team will, if
possible, all be held before the

day the try-out for first position on
the singles. The try-outs for
second place will be held on the
Saturday following, March 15th.
The doubles will be held on the
22d.
Tomorrow the new nets will be up,
and with auspicious weather there
will be considerable opportunity
for practice. A few loads of cinders
will be hauled and spread at the
ends of the courts. The "round
robin" tournament sheduled for to
morrow may not be called, but
every tennis player should show
up for practice. Wei be, Lieb, and
perhaps one or two others will go

nia Club.
