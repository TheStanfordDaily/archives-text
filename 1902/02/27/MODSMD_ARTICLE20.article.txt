# WAS A FEAST OF MUSIC.
## Chicago Symphony Orchestra Concert Appreciated by Large Audience of Music Lovers. 
### 
The large audience which gath
ered in the Assembly Hall yester
day afternoon to hear the concert
given by the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra was amply repaid for
its presence. Mr. Rosen becker
succeeded well in conducting a re
markably varied program, the
beautiful overture and Liszt's "Les
Preludes" being the numbers which
were most satisfactorily given. The
full, majestic finale to the latter
composition was really splendidly
done, marking the highest point
reached during the whole program.
The Strauss waltz and the Dvorak
dances both made thoroughly satis
factory numbers.
Although the Tschaikowski Pa
thetic Symphony was given in a
manner well worth hearing, it is no
severe criticism of Mr. Rosenbecker
to say that he failed to bring out
all the wonderful depth of beauty
thai is contained in this remarka
ble composition. The Symphony
is the masterpiece of one of the
greatest masters, and a thoroughly
satisfactory interpretation of it is
as rare as a thoroughly satisfactory
interpretation of Hamlet. Those
who were somewhat puzzled by the
rhythm of the second movement
may be interested to know that it
is written in five-four time, and is
the best known example of this
rare style of composition.
Among the soloists, Mine. Linne
deserves first mention. The Wieu
iavvski Concerto was very well given
by Mr. Van Oordt, as was also his
encore, although the latter was far
too technical to gain great apprecia
tion from most of us. The work of
the Orchestra in accompaniment
was, for the most part, a trifle too
heavy, and the failure to properly
subjugate the strings marred some
what the beauty of the ''Wald
weben." On the whole the pro
gram was not an easy one to give,
and we are to congratulate our
selves that we heard it so remarka
bly well given.
For one other thing, also, we are
indebted to Mr. Rosenbecker. His
refusal to wear out both himself
and his orchestra by responding to
repeated success is to be highly
commended. Our audiences should
remember that the rendering of a
heavy program is a considerable
strain on all concerned, the audi
ence included, and the result of ex
cessive encoring is to weaken both
the productive power of the artists
and the receptive capacity of the
hearers. A good illustration of the
effect <»112 this sort of thing was seen
at the recent concert of the Italian
Band, where the band, wearied with
undue encoring, failed to rise to the
occasion in the "Carmen" number,
which should have been a. climax,
but came dangerously near being
a n anticlimax.

The thanks of the community |
are also due to I)r. Goehel fur his
untiring efforts to make the eon
cert a success, in-so-far as the Uni
versity community was responsible
for such success.
