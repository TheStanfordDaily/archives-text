# FIELD-DAY HERE.
## Student Body Treasurers Decide to Hold Meet at Stanford. 
### 
The Intercollegiate Field-day will
be held on the Stanford campus
on April 19th. The matts' of se
lecting a place to hold the ineet
had been left in the hands of the
student body treasurers of the two
universities, DeCota and Edwards.
After throughly canvassing the
proposition of holding the meet at
Stanford, Tanforan, or in the city,
Edwards decitled that the Univer
sity is the best place for the event.
It will be more satisfactory to the
students, he thinks, and the possi
bilities of making more money by
holding it elsewhere are doubtful.
Treasurer DeCota of California to
day sent his approval of having
the meet held here.
