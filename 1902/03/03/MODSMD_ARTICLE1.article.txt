# DEDICATION ON EASTER.
## Exercises for the Memorial Church Are Postponed From Next Sunday. 
### 
The Memorial Church will be
dedicated on Easter Sunday, March
30th, instead of next Sunday as had
been planned. Mrs. Stanford auth
orized the announcement yesterday.
This will allow more time to pre
pare for the exercises.
Owing to the large crowd that
will attend the dedication, admis
sion will be given to the exercises
that day only by ticket, which stu
dents and alumni will be able to
secure at the Registrar's office some
time beforehand. The two galleries
will be reserved for students, but as
these will not hold the entire num
ber, some part of the main floor will
also be provided to accommodate the
remainder. The mechanics and
workmen who have worked on the
church, about two hundred in all,
will be present. It is Mrs.Stanford's
desire that all students, alumni,
and faculty who are able to attend
be given preference, and for this
reason tickets will be issued. Other
wise visitors from the outside might
till the church.
