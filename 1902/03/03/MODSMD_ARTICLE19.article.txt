Thjc Juniors have elected a track
captain. This is the first step
toward organization of class, teams
and the example should be fol
lowed immediately by the other
classes. Class teams will play a
larger part this spring in track
work than ever before, and hence
the need for early organization.
The Sophomores are to meet Ukiah
on the 22d, the Freshmen are to go
to Reno, and the winning class
team will undoubtedly go to Los
Angeles to meet Occidental. This
week should see every class captain
chosen and every available man
out on the track.
