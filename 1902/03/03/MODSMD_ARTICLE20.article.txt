More inconvenience than usua!
lias been caused this year by the
failure of men entered for tlie de
bate try-outs to appear in their as
signed positions. This was true!
not only in the Carnot and Inter
collegiate preliminaries, hut also in j
the class debates last. Friday and
Saturday evenings. In one in-;
stance all hut one man had with
drawn from a squud, and he was
left alone to defend the negative of
a question which had no advocates.
This was an extreme case, but al
most equal injustice has been done
when two or three drop out without
notice, disarranging the entire plan
of the debate and placing the men
who remain at a great disadvan
tage. Unavoidable circumstances
arise at times, but there can seldom
be any excuse for a man who has
entered his name and received a

position in apparent good faith
failing to ho present without giving
previous notice. When there are
several squads, eacli working on a
different question, it is impossible
to consolidate the remnants of two
or three, and any person who fails
to keep his assignment works a
serious hardship on the other speak
ers.
