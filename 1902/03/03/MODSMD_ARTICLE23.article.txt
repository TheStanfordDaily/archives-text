# Dr. Murray's Sermon.
## 
### 
Dr. Murray of the Greek depart
ment preached in the chapel yes
terday on the theme "Worship,"
which he defined as the heart's at
titude toward God regardless of
any show of splendor in the cere
mcny or place of devotion. In
this connection he compared the
magnificence that accompanied the
worship at the dedication of the
temple of Solomon with the lonely
condition and surroundings that
attended the apostles during their
struggle following the crucifixion of
Jesus. Dr. Murray closed with the
suggestion that as we are now to
have the University church and to
worship in a much grander struc
ture, that we enter there with a no
less spirit of devotion than we have
come to the present place of wor
ship.
