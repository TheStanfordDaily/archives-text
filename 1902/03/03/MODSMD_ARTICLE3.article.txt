### 
Dr. Gilbert and the others of
the party who were to have
started on the scientific expedition
to Hawaii before today have been
delayed. In the storm the other
night a transport escaped its moor
ings in San Francisco harbor and
went wandering around the bay.
Striking the United States steamer
Albatross, which is the vessel to be
used by the Fish Commission
party, in the stern. It carried off the
great anchor and anchor chain,
dropping them somewhere in the
bay. The refitting is in the hands
of the United States government
and is likely to be slow. Dr. (iil
bert hopes, however, to be off at
I lie end of this week.
