# Effects of the Storm.

### 
The record-making storm that
visited California and the Coast in
general Saturday did not neglect
the vicinity of the campus, as vari
ous mishaps testify. Beyond a
further bending of the cross on the
church, and the flooding of the
Museum basement by the bursting
of an over-worked drain-pipe, no
damage of any moment is reported
among the University buildings.
On the row many of the dwelling
houses had a hard struggle, evi
denced by sundry broken windows
and inundated cellars. A serio
comic incident was the scattering
to all parts of the campus of the
manuscript of the curtain raiser,
and a part of the second and third
acts of the Junior farce, which a
stray gust discovered in an open
window. Reconstruction was ne
cessitated.
Numerous evidences of the temp
est were left in Palo Alto, the most
startling occurrence being the elec
trocution of a, livery horse which
came in contact with a prostrate
live wire. The telephone company
was put completely out of business,
twenty-six lines in the vicinity of
I'alo Alto being incapacitated. The
electric lights shone intermittiintly.
and at times crossed altogether.
