## Ground Was Broken for Two Additional Structures This Morning. 
### 
Ground was broken this morning
for two additional University
buildings, one an imposing two
story structure that will be devoted
to the needs of the Mechanical En
gineering department, the other a
smaller building the purposes of
which are as yet undetermined.
The latter is to form that portion
of the outer quadrangle which lies
between the present headquarters
of the Latin department and the
University Inn. Its length is to be
IJ7 feet, and its width, including
the arcade, 76 feet. The height
will be one story, and in plan the
structure corresponds to the one
adjacent to it now nearing comple
tion.
At the extreme southeast of the
outer quadrangle, its 1.. shape front
facing Lasuen street and the Engi
neering laboratories, the imposing
two-story edilice which is to con
tain the oftices, drafting-rooms,
and recitation-rooms of the Me
chanical Engineering department
has been started. With its arcades,
the edifice will form the southeast
corner of the outer quad. Its ele
vation plans correspond to those of
the new History building on the
northeast. The dimensions are
150x120 feet.
A third building, and one which
will complete the second quadran
gle, is to be commenced as soon as
the contracts can be let. It will be
exactly the counterpart of the En
gineering building started today,
nnd will be devoted to the depart
ment of Geology.
The plans of each of the struc
tures mentioned were drawn by
Charles E. Hodges, the resident
University architect.
