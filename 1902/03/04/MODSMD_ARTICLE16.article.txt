As the semester progresses the
Inn Club becomes more firmly es
tablished. The venture has had
careful and conservative manage
ment, and during the month just
closed has made considerable gain
in resources, compensating for the
necessarily heavy expenditure of
the first few weeks. The experi

of the club becoming a permanent
institution. The question of board

so much discomfort in the past,
seems to be solved.
