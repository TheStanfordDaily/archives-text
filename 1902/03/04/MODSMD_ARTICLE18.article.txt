Stanford is one of the institu
tions to he included in the Inter
collegiate Athletic Calendar this
year. We take pleasure in endors
ing the following comment from
the Michigan Daily News:
The effort now being made by
the managers of the Lntercollegiate
Athletic Calendar to interest the
students at all the universities of
the country in that book is a com
mendable one. Formerly this pub
lication was limited in its scope to
:i summary of the athletic situa
tion in the East. Now, however, it
is proposed to include a review of
college athletics in the whole
United States. This advance
should he heartily welcomed by
Western colleges. It marks the
breaking down of the barrier of ex
clusiveness by which the Eastern
ers have hitherto surrounded them
selves. It means a closer union
and better relations between the
great universities and colleges of
both East and West, not only in
athletics but in all intercollegiate
interests as well.
