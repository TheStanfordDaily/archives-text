The Soph Try-Outs.
The contest for positions on the
Sophomore debating team was held
in the chapel at 7:30 last Friday
evening. The judges were F. 15.
Wagner, E. W. Ilice, anil L. L.
Loofbourow of the Carnot team.
(). 1). Scott presided.
The first speaker of the evening,
0. II. Bitter, was unfortunate in
being the only member of the first
squad who had not withdrawn his
name before the debate. In spite
of this handicap, however, Bitter
delivered a sound, logical argu
ment. on the negative of the ship
subsidy question. His form and
delivery were better than usual,
and the conclusion of his speech
was particularly forcible.
L. 1>. Lockwood opened the dis
cussion for the second squad,
speaking on the affirmative of the
question,''Resolved, That the adop
tion of the Fifteenth Amendment
was unwise." Lock wood's voice
was good, and bis delivery and
gestures were graceful and pleasing.
His argument was of the persuasive
sort, but it seemed to lack evidence
and to contain too much repeti
tion.
C. L. Duncan, who followed for
the negative, gave the impression
of being a little over-prepared. But
his argument was good, and fairly
well presented, though his voice
did not quite fill the room.
R. H. McComas, speaking second
on the affirmative, displayed con
siderable originality and power of
interesting his bearers. Apparent
inexperience in debate, however,
was shown by his rambling some
what from the question, and by
speaking several minutes overtime.
M. E. Van Dine, the concluding
speaker on the negative, began his
speech forcibly and well, and
showed a good grasp of his subject.
The question for the third squad
was, "Resolved, That the white
people of the South are justified in
taking every honorable means in
maintaining their political and
social supremacy over the negro."
Both the affirmative speakers on
this question, Lewis and Jones,
made the Sophomore team. II. M.
Lewis, the first, affirmative, deliv
ered what was, in the opinion of
many, the best argument of the
evening. His manner of presenta
tion was agreeable.
