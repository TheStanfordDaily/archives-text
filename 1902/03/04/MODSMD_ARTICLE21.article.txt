The Soph Try-Outs.
The contest for positions on the
Sophomore debating team was held
in the chapel at 7:30 last Friday
evening. The judges were F. 15.
Wagner, E. W. Ilice, anil L. L.
Loofbourow of the Carnot team.
(). 1). Scott presided.
The first speaker of the evening,
0. II. Bitter, was unfortunate in
being the only member of the first
squad who had not withdrawn his
name before the debate. In spite
of this handicap, however, Bitter
delivered a sound, logical argu
ment. on the negative of the ship
subsidy question. His form and
delivery were better than usual,
and the conclusion of his speech
was particularly forcible.
L. 1>. Lockwood opened the dis
cussion for the second squad,
speaking on the affirmative of the
question,''Resolved, That the adop
tion of the Fifteenth Amendment
was unwise." Lock wood's voice
was good, and bis delivery and
gestures were graceful and pleasing.
His argument was of the persuasive
sort, but it seemed to lack evidence
and to contain too much repeti
tion.
C. L. Duncan, who followed for
the negative, gave the impression
of being a little over-prepared. But
his argument was good, and fairly
well presented, though his voice
did not quite fill the room.
R. H. McComas, speaking second
on the affirmative, displayed con
siderable originality and power of
interesting his bearers. Apparent
inexperience in debate, however,
was shown by his rambling some
what from the question, and by
speaking several minutes overtime.
M. E. Van Dine, the concluding
speaker on the negative, began his
speech forcibly and well, and
showed a good grasp of his subject.
The question for the third squad
was, "Resolved, That the white
people of the South are justified in
taking every honorable means in
maintaining their political and
social supremacy over the negro."
Both the affirmative speakers on
this question, Lewis and Jones,
made the Sophomore team. II. M.
Lewis, the first, affirmative, deliv
ered what was, in the opinion of
many, the best argument of the
evening. His manner of presenta
tion was agreeable.
11. A. Moran, who upheld the
negative, marred bin speuli, which
showed ability and was well
planned, by a slight nervousness
of manner.
A. Jones followed for the affirma
tive with an argument which was
sound and commendable. His
strongest quality was his admirable
lecture form and excellent de
livery, in which his speech excelled
those of bis competitors.
G. W. Leistner opened the de
bate for the fourth squad, which
argued for the abolishment of the
canteen, both the negative speakers
having defaulted. Leistner's speech
excelled in originality, humor, and
conversational style.
C. B. Wintler, the last speaker
of the evening, made a good speech,
showing a remarkable improve
ment over bis work in the Inter
collegiate preliminaries, He spoke
a little too fast, but his delivery
was fluent and ready, and his ar
gument logical.
The decision was announced by
F. B. Wagner, after about twenty
minutes deliberation.
Freshman Team Selected.
At the Freshman try-out .Satur
day evening the audience was
limited to the contestants, the two
judges—Professors Rieberand Ram
melkamp, the time - keeper, the
chairman —J.Coleman (presidentof
the Freshman class), and two spec
tators.
C. L. Lyman opened the debate
for the first squad, which discussed
the question, "llesolved, That the
Southern States are justified in op
posing by all constitutional means
the development of the political
power of the negro." Lyman seemed
well prepared, and delivered a fair
argument. W. L. Blair followed
for the negative contending that it
is neither necessary nor wise for
the South to take away the political
rights of the negro. P. I). Swing
came second on the affirmative. He
made definite progress in the debate,
but lacked smoothness in enuncia
tion.
The second squad argued the
question, "Resolved, That the Uni
ted States should resist by force, if
need be, any further colonization
of South America by Europe." 0.
Gibbons, who spoke first, had a
good argument, but was a little
hard to follow. A. M. Dibble was
the first debater of the evening who
did not seem to be talking against
time. His speech was convincing,
and seemed well planued. B. C.
Dey, second affirmative, gave a
fluent presentation of the case,
bringing out all his points clearly
and gracefully, and reenforced them
with effective gestures. H. G. Gib
son concluded for the negative with
a speech that showed considerable
natural force and originality.
The debate for the third squad
was on the subject, "Resolved, That
mun'cipalities should own and
operate their light, and water facil
ities." The first affirmative, A.
Sheriffs, was the best debater of
the evening, and gave the impres
sion of being an experienced!
speaker familiar with liis subject i
and able to convince his audience.)
His rebuttal was especially clever.
C. Peach, the first, negative, devoted |
the greater part of bis time to an
at ternpt at answering t he argument
of his opponent. T. Van Sickle,
speaking on the affirmative, de
livered a good argument.
The fourth squad discussed the

question of the federal ownership
of the railroads in the United
States, and E. K. Finney
opened with an argument that
showed careful preparation. E. B.
Favre spoke on the negative
with originality and considerable
ability. C. M. Coen gave a
well argument, but
seemed to lack interest in bis sub
ject.
After about five minutes deliber
ation, Professor llieber rendered
the decision announced above, and
President Coleman then gave the
three victorious contestants the
1905 debating pins.
