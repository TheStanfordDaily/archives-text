One of Stanford's violinists has
heard Miss Jackson, and has this
to say regarding the recital:
"We shall have tomorrow night
the opportunity of hearing the most
famous violinist America has pro
duced— one who has delighted the
crowned heads of Europe, and
ranks with Y.saye, Marteau, Petch
nikoff, and one or two others as
among the foremost exponents of
true violin playing. This is an op
portunity, not often presented, to
hear an artist the standard of
whose playing is of the highest,
and to give yourself the opportu
nity of hearing music the mere re
membrance of which will arouse
you to enthusiasm. A woman,
she has yet mastered tasks the dif
ficulty of which were so great that
her rivals dropped by the wayside
and left her to go on into the deep
est depths of violin technique.
But not alone is she complete
master of technique; on the con
trary, her exquisite tone, full,clear,
perfectly unstrained; her delicate
phrasi 11jj, ex pressi ve and comma tid
ing; and her wonderful bowing,
easy, graceful and effortless —make
one forget the supreme difficulties
she is conquering with her lingers.
' There is not the slightest touch
<>112 affectation about her playing.
She plays to your innerst lf diredly,
trusting only to her art to make a
conquest of you. and not relying
(>n those many small artifices
which most virtuosi employ.
Simply and naturally she draws
out of her violin a wealth of tone,

color, and feeiing, sustained or
changing, as the mood demands,
and never breaking in roughly up
on your sense of hearing. But
gradually she carries you with her
to the extent where your musical
feelings chime with hers to such a
degree that the music seems to
have entered your heart and soul
as it left hers."
