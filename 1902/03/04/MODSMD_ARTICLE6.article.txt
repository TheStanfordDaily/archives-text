# On the Track Again.
## 
### 
With the return of good weather
a large number of men turned out
on the track last night. A few
weeks will see the weeding out of
the poorer material, that which
will never get into Varsity form; so
that the trainer, captain, and rub
ber can give more individual at
tention to those who are best titled
to go against Berkeley.
The track is still quite soft, the
wet weather having prevented the
use of a roller on the cinders. Those
intimate with track work assert that
every man should recognize the
fact that the trainer has been handi
capped by the long spell of wet
weather, which has prohibited the
use of the track for about a month;
and to make up, should get out
every night and work harder than
ever.
