# Will Include Western Colleges.
## 
### 
This year it is the intention of
the editors of the Intercollegiate
Athletic Calendar to enlarge the
scope of the volume so as to include
the athletics of the Middle West
and Western universities, says the
Michigan Daily News. It is thought
that this innovation will not only
make it a more perfect compilation
and record of the college athletic
history of the country, but it will
also serve the purpose of bringing
the colleges of the Middle West into
closer relations with the Eastern
institutions. The publication has
a circulation throughout all the
Eastern colleges, although as yet it
is comparatively unknown in the
West. Heretofore it has contained
about 200 pages, illustrated with
over 100 cuts of the athletic teams
of the larger Eastern colleges, with
the athletic history in full.
