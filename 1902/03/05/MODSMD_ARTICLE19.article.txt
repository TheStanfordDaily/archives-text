V kbtkki jay's showing by (he
Varsity baseball team at Belmont
is more than encouraging. It is
not the fact that we won nor that
the score was liig and decisive
which causes elation of the Car
dinal; but it is the fact that our
men played clean, careful, steady
baseball â€”the kind that will count
when the big games come. There

whs not an error in the exhibition,
although the chances were as nu- j
merouH as they usually are. This
is encouraging. Coach Swindells'J
work is beginning to tell.
