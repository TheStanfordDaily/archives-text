# Meeting of Mathematicians.
## 
### 
Members of the mathematical
departments of the University of
California anil Stanford held a
dinner recently to bring them to
gether to discuss and take initial
steps for organizing a branch of tiie
American Mathematical Society
here on the Pacific Coast. The
meeting was presided over by Pro
fessor Irving Stringham of Califor
nia, mid Dr. E. M. Blake, likewise
from there, acted as temporary
secretary. A committee composed
of Dr. E. J. Wilez);nski, of Califor
nia, and Professor G. A. Miller, of
Stanford, was appointed to make
an organization and take charge of
tbe preparation for a meeting to be
held on May 3d. A petition to the
National Council has already been
made and has been received favor
ably. It will be finally acted upon
at tbe regular meeting in April. Of
this society the Daily Californian
says:
"This society was originally called
'The New York Mathematical So
ciety.' Some ten years ago, how
ever, it became known as 'The
American Mathematical Society,'
with headquarters in New York. A
little later a branch was established
in Chicago, where much activity
has been shown. It is now proposed
that the prominent Western math
ematicians become members of this
national organization.
"The society has done much for
the progress of mathematics in this
country. It publishes two periodi
cals, one of them appearing month
ly and called The Bulletin of the
American Mathematical Society.
This bulletin is mainly devoted to
historical and critical review of
mathematical happenings. The
other periodical, The Transactions
of the American Mathematical So
ciety, appears four times a year,
and contains important contribu
tions to mathematical thought."
