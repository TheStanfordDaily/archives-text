# PLAY ERRORLESS GAME.
## Varsity Defeats Belmont School Six to Nothing, Putting up Gilt-Edged Ball. 
### 
By a score of six to nothing, the
Varsity defeated Belmont School
at Belmont yesterday afternoon
and put up an exhibition of base
ball that won much commendation
from the small but enthusiastic
crowd of spectators. The score
tells just what kind of a game it
was. The class of ball was of a
high order, the Varsity quite gen
erally retiring the Belmont team
in one, two, three order. The
Stanford men played an errorless
game. The features of the contest
were the splendid pitching of Mc-
Farland and the excellent stick
work of Lowenthal. McFarland
was never in better condition than
yesterday, and in addition to his
having nine strike-outs to his
credit he never walked one of the
Belmont boys to the initial. He
was cool and steady during the en
tire match.
His support was gilt-edged, as
was Lanagan's. The prep, school
youngsters gave the latter support
that would do credit to any var
sity team. Lanagan pitched a
great game, but the Varsity men
found him for three pretty hits,
while the best that Belmont could
do off McFarland was one scratch
hit and one clean one.
The Belmont players were sim
ply outclassed, not one of their
men reaching third base in the
nine innings. But it is to their
credit that they put up as strong a
game against the Varsity as one
would want to see. The score fol
lows:
