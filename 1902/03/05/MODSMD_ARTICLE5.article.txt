# THE 						JUNIOR PROM.
## Yanke's Military Band Will Furnish Music.â€”Elaborate Preparations. 
### 
The Junior Prom Committee last
evening made preliminary plans
for the dance which occurs the
night of Junior day, March 28th.
It was decided to have Yanke's
uniformed military band of four
teen pieces furnish the music. This
is a new venture in music for class
dances. An elaborate supper will
be served in the lobby of the second
floor of Encina, and it is expected
to eclipse any previous endeavor in
the refreshment line. Plans were
discussed for decorations, but no
definite action was taken in that
regard. Competition for the pro
gram prize ends next Tuesday.
Tickets will be four dollars.
