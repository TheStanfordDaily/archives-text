An excellent full-dress rehearsal
of the Pirates of Penzance was held
last evening in the Assembly Hall.
A picture of the finale < 112 the first
act was taken for the Quad. The
play is being put into fine shape
for the production on Friday even
ing. Many of the minor faults of
the first presentation have been
corrected, and on the whole the play
will he excellently given. The
seats are selling well, especially for
a second time. Many people are
expected from Redwood, Mountain
View, and the surrounding towns,
and with good weather a large
crowd is looked for.
