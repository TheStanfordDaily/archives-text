# STORY OF GAME.
## Varsity Did Not Put Up Fast Ball Yesterday.—Five Innings Played. 
### 
One to nothing in favor of the
visiting team was the score of the
short game yesterday between the
Varsity and the Han Jose Profes
sional team. The match promised
to be a close and exciting one, but
the usual rain came up just at the
unfortunate moment, and the con
test was called in the fifth inning.
The Varsity gave no indications
of repeating its commendable per
formance of the day before at Bel
mont and leaving a clean record
in the error column, for in the few
moments of play yesterday tive in
excusable, but not costly, errors
were recorded against the infield.
Home of the players were a little too
nervous for faet ball. Notwithstand
ing this fact the game was interest
ing, and showed what the men can
can do with additional practice.
Martin, who has recently been
signed by the San Francisco League
team, was in the box for the Pro
fessionals. The class of twirlers be
served to Stanford was not so
puzzling as had been expected, and
lie was found for two safe hits.
Parker was at his best, and kept
the hits of the opponents down to
two singles. McGilvray caught
well, and did some clever throwing
to bases. A very small crowd was
in attendance, not more than sixty
people being on the bleachers.
The score follows:
