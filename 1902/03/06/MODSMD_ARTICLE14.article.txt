The attendance at yesterday's
baseball game was pitiably small,
especially when taken in connec
tion with the few opportunities of
playing the Varsity has had of
late. This is an oft repeated but con
stantly corroborated fact,that noth
ing will incite a team to do its best
more than the presence of sympa
thetic spectators and an occasional
hearty cheer. Moreover, every ad
mission fee received by the man
agement means just that much
additional impetus to an activity
in which the student body is vitally
interested. To encourage our
players and help Manager Edwards
in his endeavor to keep the finances
in a healthy condition we can do
no better than to be in evidence at
the games.

In an editorn 1 outburst the Daily
Nebraskan makes some .spicy obser
vations about a spirit that mani
fests itself among a few students at
the University of Nebraska. If
any of the comments may be made
to apply at (Stanford, readers are
at liberty to make their own selec
tion. The editorial says:
There are evidently a few stu
dents in the university who fail to
appreciate the fact that writing
for the college paper is a privilege.
Especially is it surprising, not to
say deplorable, to find a student in
this institution who replies with
"What is there in it?'' when asked
to write up a small bit of news.
It is needless to say that the gen
eral bearing of such students is
such as to make them free from be
ing asked to do writing of import
ance. These students, who always
ask "What is there in it?" are the
very ones who are a drawback to
an institution of learning; who find
fault with every university under
taking; who climb over the fence
to see the football games and then
condemn the manager for not sell
ing enough tickets. At every free
entertainment they occupy the fore
most seats bin are always missing
when there is an admission fee.
