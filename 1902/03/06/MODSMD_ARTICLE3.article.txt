# AUDIENCE CHARMED.
## Small Crowd Heard Leonora Jackson's Wonderful Performance Last Evening. 
### 
Last night Leonora Jackson, the
distinguished violinist, charmed
and delighted a small but very ap
preciative audience. The inclem
ency of the weather, and the fact
that her concert came in such close
proximity to the Chicago Orchestra
and ''The Pirates of Penzance,"
were undoubtedly the factors caus
ing the meager attendance. Before
the evening was over, however, in
spite of the many disadvantages
she had to overcome, in the shape
of a poor piano for the accompani
ment, and the effect of the weather
on her violin, she had the house
won by her simple, graceful, and
modest appearance, her sympa
thetic tone, and her wonderful in
terpretation.
Miss Jackson's tone was extraor
dinarily pure and full, her harmo
nies flawless, her shading of tone
and expression pleasing, and her
bowing, above all, a delight both to
see and to hear. Her change of
bow whs imperceptible, her change
from position to position on the
finger-board almost equally so. In
one or two places there was slurring
which was a little exaggerated.
The artist's mastery of technical
difficulties was pronounced in the
first number, the Vieuxtemps Con
certo in 1) minor, which called for
a facility of both bow and lingers
attained only by long years of con
stant practice. She displayed in
this number perfect technique.
Easily, seemingly without an effort,
she covered all technical difficulties
in such a superb manner that won
der grew and grew, to see how those
girlish fingers could perform the
arduous task. Through all this
her interpretative faculties held
sway. She never allowed technical
difficulties to absorb her to an ex
tent where interpretation and gen
uine feeling would grow secondary.
She variated perfectly from the
high, rapid notes on the upper
strings to the deep, long sustained
ones on the lower. There was
not a jar in the whole execution,
and she left the impression of a.
perfect mastery of the technical
and, what is still more, of the in
terpretative difficulties of the vio
lin.
Following the "Vieuxtemps Con
certo" Miss Jackson played four
lighter and shorter numbers, which
served admirably to bring out a
wealth of feeling and color. In
the "Zephyr" by Jenoy Hubay, a
Hungarian composer, she was es
pecially successful. There was
something lacking in her final
number, a "Gypsy Fantasie" by
Sarasate. This was not played
with the fire and dash which it re
quires, and which it took a Sara
sate to i in part.
Mr. Bauer, the pianist, though
laboring under the disadvantages
of a poor piano, was very much ap
preciated. His technique was clear
and graceful, but the preponder
ance he gave the bass proved dis
turbing once or twice. His change
of color and feeling was excellent,
especially in the llubenstein Polo
naise, through the first intricacies

of which he carried his hearers
with an ever-increasing interest,
culminating successfully with the
grand motif, made visible through
out the number by his skilful in
tonation and phrasing. His ac
companiment was especially grati
fying, being intelligent and moder
ate in the extreme. Leonora Jack
son certainly was accorded.splendid
support by him.
Mr. Fellows was more successful
with his three short songs than in
his first long one, in which an in
clination toward nasal enunciation
prevailed. His voice was of pleas
ing timbre, and though not very
powerful, was well modulated.
