## 
### 
A tablet fifty feet long is being
prepared, which will be placed on
the front of the church. On it will
be carved, "Memorial Church,
erected to the glory of God and in
loving memory of my husband.
Leland Stanford." Its position
will be directly under the front row
of windows. From this tablet to
the top of the gable the front of the
church will be covered with mosa
ics. The design to the left will be a
figure entitled "La Vita," from the
painting by Guido Reni, and to the
right a tigure called "II Tempo,"
from the painting by Itaffaelo.
Above this and rising to the gable
will be a representation of the
painting, "Christ Speaking to the
People," by A. Ermolao Taoletti.
On the interior of the church, from
the top of the stone arches to the
first balcony of ttie tower, will be
placed mosaic designs, the patterns
for which have not yet arrived.
Above this balcony, to the top of
th* dome, the walls will be frescoed.
The mosaics come from the fac
tory of Salviati in Venice, Italy,
and are being put up bv Zampatto
Lorenzo and Angelo Delia. Toffola.
Practically all of the windows
have been set, the latest being the
large one in the front, entitled the
"Rose Window," in the center of
which i's the Christ child. Seen
from the interior this window is a
marvel of beauty.
The stairways are being placed
in the vestibules, the pews are be
ing varnished, and the temporary
electric light chandeliers, number
ing 750 lights, have been putin
place. A large bronze reading-desk
in the form of an angel has been
set at the right-hand side of the
apse.
