# THE
						PIRATES AGAIN.
## Comic Opera Tomorrow Promises to Surpass Success of Original Performance. 
### 
The final rehearsal of the Pirates
of Penzance preliminary to the sec
ond production of the opera in the
Assembly Hall tomorrow night
took place this afternoon, the gen
eral verdict of the cast being that
the performance was a more fin
ished one in every detail than the
public presentation of two weeks
ago. Every point where improve
ment could possibly be made was
carefully noted on the former occa
sion by Director Weer, and the re
sult of his observations has been
effectively applied. Rough places
were few enough in the work of the
chorus and principals, but such as
they were, they have been scrupu
lously eliminated, until now a per
formance is assured which will em
body all the possibilities of the
singers. Among the new features
are a number of cleverly interpo
lated local hits.
The sale of seats, the price of
which has been tixed at 35 and 50
cents, has been fairly brisk, but the
size of the house will depend on
the weather tomorrow. If the
evening is favorable, a large num
ber of tickets will go to residents of
the valley towns who were deterred
by the rain-storm from witnessing
the first production.
