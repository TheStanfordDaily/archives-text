# U.C. VS. SANTA CLARA.
## A 						Good Game is Promised on Stanford Campus Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
Good baseball is promised at the
game between California and Santa
Clara on the campus tomorrow
afternoon. Play begins at 2:30,
and the usual admission fee of
twenty-five cents will be charged.
Santa clara is playing a fast
game this year, and the contest
will be an interesting one. Cali
fornia has been impeded by the
rain as much as Stanford in carry
ing out the preliminary schedule,
and the field at Berkeley has been
in a worse condition for practice
than the diamond here. However,
the U. C. aggregation is almost the
same as it was last year, and the
loss of practice will not be felt as
much as in the Stanford team,
which is made up largely of new
men.
California has two good pitchers,
Overall and Williams. Braly is
an excellent man on second, and
shortstop Adams is a new man who
substituted in one game here last
year. The team has defeated the
Alumni, which was supported by a
poor pitcher, 14-4, and easily piled
up a score of 1(5-2 against the Deaf
and Dumb Asylum, but it went
under to St. Mary's by 3-0. Many
games of the schedule were not
played last month.
The line-up of the teams will be:
CALIFORNIA. SANTA CLAHA.
