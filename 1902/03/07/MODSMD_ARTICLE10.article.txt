Thecrossof the Memorial Church,
which has been removed, will be re
placed by one slightly smaller and
of greater strength. A Roman cross
of stone will be placed on the gable
end at the front of the building.
The chandeliers which were recently
hung in the body of the church are
to be replaced by a chandelier of
the ''rainbow shape."
