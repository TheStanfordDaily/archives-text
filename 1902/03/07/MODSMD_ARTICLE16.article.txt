# "Chappie" Under New Management.
## 
### 
The initial number of the Chap
arral under the new management
is eminently successful. It con
tains a great deal of verse —good
verse, too —(he best of which is
"The Ballad of ye Oyster-Loaf,"
by Miss Barbara G. Hitt, with
illustrations by Miss EthelTrapha
gen.

There are fewer drawings than
usual, hut the high standing set by
the preceding editors is main Lai net l .
F. B. Tucker,'os, B. C. Buhl), '04,
and R. P. McLaughlin, '02, are
among the new contributors, and
the work of Larry Bowman and
Bristow Adams is attractive.
Among the noteworthy features are
"My Lady's Wheel," a poem hy
Hazel Hope Webster; "Will the
Muse Work Backwards?" a series
of verse purporting to he addressed
to three prominent men of the stu
dent bod)' by feminine admirers;
some clever foot-notes from the
"Parlorous Altar"; an ingenious
"Key to the Bawl-Out"; and Chap
pie's Examinations. The editorials
are good.
The one bad feature of the issue
is "A Second Interlude." It is
difficult to speak dispassionately of
this. One was disposed to overlook
the grossness of the first article on
the ground of extreme verdancy;
but had as that one was, it pales
before the second installment. And
if it is crude, what shall be said as
to its offense against good taste?
The introduction of personalities
into such an article calls for severe
condemnation. The writer, it
seems, has begun to have doubts
himself, for this second article is
unsigned. The editor should in
vest in a blue pencil.
