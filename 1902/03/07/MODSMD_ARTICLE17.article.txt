# The
						"Sequoia" Monday.
## 
### 
The latest number of the Sequoia,
which comes out next Monday, con
tains some very good stories. In
"Snake-Eyed l'asqnal," a tale of a
Cocopah medicine man, H. F. Cool
idge lias attempted the rather diffi
cult task of placing a theme of sav
age superstitution in the midst of
conventional surroundings. Told
in his usual terse and forceful man
ner it is on the whole successful.
"Death by Common Consent," by
T. E. .Stephenson, is an incident in
cowboy life,dramatically told. "A
Soliloquy of a Dutch Jug," by Miss
Alice Aileen Higgins, is a charming
little story,delightfully quaint and
humorous. The introductory poem,
"The Acknowledgment," by 11. E.
Renaud, and"The Last Reward,"
by Miss E. F. Parsons, are the verse
features of this number. The edi
torial alludes indirectly to the
scarcity of verse writers this year.
