A baseball game will be played
on the campus between the Univer
sity of California and Santa Clara
College tomorrow afternoon —pro-
vided the elements do not interfere.
The first match of the intercolleg
iate series is only four weeks in the
future, and this game is of peculiar
interest to Stanford, for it offers not
only an opportunity to observe the
work of the men from across the
bay, but also to show a cordial,
sportsmanlike interest in the play
ers from the neighboring institu

tioiiw which meet oil neutral ground
for an exhibition contest.
Santa Clara has always heen
most valuable as a rival of the Car
dinal during the early part of the
season, and its team is well-known
on the campus. California, Stan
ford's chief competitor in baseball
as well as in football, track, tennis,
and debate, seldom appears here
except in intercollegiate games.
Rivalry with these two institutions
makes the development of a base
hall tenm possible. The visitors
should be given a royal welcome.
