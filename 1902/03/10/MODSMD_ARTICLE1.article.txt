# HIS LIFE ENDED.
## Sudden Death of James William Cameron in San Francisco Hospital. 
### 
James \V. Cameron, '08, passed
away at the Lane Hospital in San
Francisco a few minutes after two
o'clock on the morning of Satur
day, March Bth, after a critical ill
ness of little more than twenty-four
hours. The immediate cause of his
death, which came unexpectedly
even to the attendant surgeons, was
the shock and collapse incident to
an operation for the removal of a
gastric ulcer. The affection was
probably of long standing, although
there had been no previous realiza
tion of its nature.
None c.f Cameron's relatives were
present at the end. His venerable
father is now hastening from his
home in Montana in response to a
message apprising him of the sad
result, and all the necessary ar
rangements are at rest until his
arrival.
In Friday night's issue of this
paper there appeared an item of
comparative insignificance stating
that Cameron had been taken to
the Lane Hospital to be treated
for an attack of what seemed to
be appendicitis. That danger was
so imminent was not for a moment
realized, even by the friends who
were with him through the agony
of the first attack and the hours of
inconceivable suffering that ensued.
It was just after one o'clock last
Friday morning that Cameron's
Encina Hall room-mate, Joseph 11.
Page, '08, was awakened to find
his friend tossing in almost unen
durable pain, the seat of the attack
being apparently a. trifle to the
right of the median abdominal line
in the region of the stomach.
Everything possible in the way of
local applications was done, but it
was soon seen that the trouble was
of a serious nature and that medi
cal help was necessary. Dr. Wil
bur was summoned and reached
the scene at two o'clock. The case
was baffling from the first and the
physician did not hesitate in order
ing Cameron to be taken to the
city hospital on the earliest train.
Meanwhile his suffering was al
layed to such an extent that Dr.
Wilbur returned to his home only
to be recalled by a second attack at
live o'clock. The patient was con
veyed to the train leaving Palo
Alto at 7:80, and in the care of W.
Lee Lewis, '02, and H. A. Sprague,
'04, he was taken to San Francisco
and to the hospital. The journey
was attended with constant suffer
ing, the acuteness of which, disap
peared shortly after the arrival at
the hospital, permitting a sleep of
some hours duration. After see
ing that everything intelligent
care and the highest medical skill
could devise was beine done for the
sick man, Lewis returned to the
University, leaving Sprague to stay
until after the operation, which
had proved necessary. During the
afternoon Cameron talked ration
ally with his friend, but had little
realization of the gravity of the
situation. Until the final diagno
sis both the surgeons and himself
believed the trouble to be appendi

citis, the symptoms of which were
almost exactly duplicated.
The operation, which was of an
intensely complicated nature, was
performed by Dr. Stillman, the sur
gical specialist of the Lane Hos
pital, assisted by I)r. Thorite, Dr.
Castigan, and Dr. Rumwell, three
eminent San Francisco surgeons,
and by Drs. Watt, Hertzog, and
McCue, the hospital internes. The
cause of the trouble was located
and removed, and there were al
most even chances of recovery
until at 2:15, about half tut hour
after the operation was completed,
and while the patient was appar
ently in an untroubled sleep, the
heart suddenly succumbed to tlie
over-powering strain to which it
had been subjected and life ceased
without a tremor to tell of its
departure.
James William Cameron was
born in Carson City, Nevada, .June
2,1877: his age was twenty-four
years, nine months, and six days.
Most of his life was passed in Boze
tnan, Montana, where his father
and a family consisting of three
brothers and two young sisters now
reside. His earl)' education, which
was received in the common schools
and in a college at Bozeman, ended
in 1808, when he enlisted with it
company enrolled in his home town
for service in the Philippines. For
over a year he shared the uncer
tainties of army life in the tropics,
and it is probable that the iounda
tions were then laid for the afllic
tion which finally overcame him.
At one time he was taken to the
hospital in Manila suffering with
an attack very similar to the recent
one, but it left him after three
days, and was attributed to indi
gestion In August, 1899, he re
turned to the United States- and in
September entered Stanford, thus
realizing a boyhood ambition.
Cameron's first year at the Uni
versity was passed in comparative
seclusion. 11 is few intimate friends
knew him as a student whose high
aspirations were matched by un
usual depth of character and un
flagging energy. The ability as an
organizer and as a moving force in
needful enterprises, which came to
be very marked later on, was al
ready shown in the effectiveness
with which he aided in the forma
tion of the Society of Stanford Vol
unteers. He had chosen law as a
life profession, and with a desire to
develop his talent for public speak
ing he joined forces with Euphro
nia Literary Society, which three
semesters after his initiation gave
him a unanimous vote for the pres
idency.
Last year Cameron came to be
known as a debater of Varsity cal
ibre, his first attempts winning
him a place in the Carnot finals
and later in the finals of the Inter
collegiate. His highest ambition
while in college was to represent
Stanford on the platform, and to
attain that end he was willing to
make every effort. But it is note
worthy that in all his endeavor
outside the classroom he never per
mitted other interests to infringe
upon the standards of scholarship
be himself had set.
For the past year Cameron's life

had been a compelling force wher
ever exercised. The duties of En
cina Club's president during the
fall semester he fulfilled with all
possible energy and tact, and the
larger opportunities encountered in
the councils of the student body
Executive Committee were met
with a far-seeing adaptability that
brought his executive ability into
strong relief and marked him as a
man to bear scrutiny.
Had perfect health been granted
him, Cameron's grit and a physique
in many ways excellent, would have
made him famous as an athlete. He
had always had a tendency in this
direction, which went to account in
his work with the Oymnasiuni Club.
In addition to the affiliations men
tioned above, he was a member of
the legal fraternity, Phi Delta Phi.
One of the dead student's closest
friends has spoken of his character
in this manner:
"Cameron was a very superior
man of more than ordinary promise.
By nature he was far from self
assertive, and only those who knew
him closer realize l the full depth
and richness of his character. Ac
quaintance ripened only slowly into
a strong and abiding friendship. To
such he seemed to have realized
most nearly what this institution
stands for, in full, round manhood.
His was a strong, calm mind, set
in a nature conscientious and un
selfish almost to a fault. All his
conduct was ruled by principle, and
no element of policy or self-seeking
entered into his motives. In little
things—if, indeed, there are little
things is such lives—he was ever
sympathetic and considerate. He
was first to offer a helping hand
when others were sick or in need.
Such deeds were not for parade, but
rather the simple, open expression
of a nature kind and gentle.
"In this last year at the Univer
sity especially, he seemed to come
into fuller possession of himself,
and to feel more the earnestness
of our work here. He was a type
of the clean, manly Stanford man.
To us who feel his loss most deeply,
it is a solace to know that though
his life was cut short cruelly and
quickly, yet be had realized in
what was granted him its best
possibilities."
