### 
At the second production of the
Pirates of Penzance last Friday
night Ihe Assembly 11 all was about
half tilled. The performa nee as a
whole was better than the former
one. Credit is due Mr. YVeer, the
conductor, for sustaining the inter
est of the cast, in their parts, and
for eliminating many of the imper
fections <>112 the first production.
The cast showed greater con
fidence, ami seemed to be thorough
ly at ease. Mrs. Roberts as Mabei
was as elia i mingly graceful as'ever.
Miss Bartlett carried her difficult
part more successfully than befoie.
Her contralto is full and rich, and
capable of showing much feeling.
C. Jj. Firebaugh, the pirate Icing,
sang as well as he did before and
acted much better. l)r. Little's
tenor was fuller and much more
dramatic than at the former per
formance. Case, as the sergeant of
police, did justice to the more comic
side of the opera. He introduced
some new features. Ceneral Stan
ley's daughters acquitted them
selves with as much credit as be
fore, and the chorus work of the
pirate gang and police force was
considerably more effective and
amusing. The audience, in spite of
its size, was very enthusiastic, the
comic parts being particular pop
ular.
