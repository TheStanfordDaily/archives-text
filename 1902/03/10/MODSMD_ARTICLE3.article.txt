# Ball Games Not Played.
## 
### 
The ball game scheduled on the
Stanford campus Saturday after
noon between the University of Cal
ifornia and Santa Clara College was
called off on account of the rain, as
was also the one at Berkeley be
tween Stanford and Olympics.
Manager Edwards is not on the
campus today and it is impossible
to learn whether or not these games
will be held at some future date.
