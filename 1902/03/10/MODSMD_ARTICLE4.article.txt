# GOOD TRACK TRIALS.
## Friday's Work Shows Condition and Ability of Men.â€”Varsity May Go to Reno. 
### 
A number of very good trials
were run on the track on Friday
afternoon. T. McCaughern, '05,
and Hamilton, '04, are doing good
work in the hundred, and will im
piove a great deal before the Inter
collegiate. JMcCaughern, '03, is
running in hin old form and will
he a hard man to heat in which
ever event he enters, either the
hundred or the quarter. Dunn, '04,
and Smith, '03, are both at the
quarter, with prospects in favor of
reducing their last year's records.
Crossman, '04, has a long stride,
and with a little increase in wind
will he a feature in the try-outs for
the quarter. In the half, probably
Thompson, '03, has shown up best
so far, though there are several
who can run him a close race.
It is very hard to determine the
best men in the mile and two-mile,
though it is easily conceded that
Chadbourne, '02, can win either
one he enters in. Davis, '03, and
McLaughlin, '02, at present suffer
ing from an injured knee, will cer
tainly figure in the distances. J.
(J. Taylor, '04, is laid off from the
hurdles on account of sickness.
Naramore, '03, and Kuhn, '03, can
be counted on for high hurdle work.
The weight men and jumpers have
not been doing much for some time.
Hyde, '04, with the shot, and Nich
ols, '04, with the hammer, are in
the lead. Crawford, '03, will im
prove sufficiently to he a point
winner both in the class meet and
in the Intercollegiate.
The meet with Occidental College
has not as yet been fully arranged.
The University of Nevada has
written asking for a meet on the
oval April 26th, one week after the
Intercollegiate, in return for a
meet to be held with the Freshmen
at Lie no on the 12th ; but if the
proposition is not accepted they
are willing to meet either the
Freshmen or Varsity at Reno or
Stanford on either date. If the
Varsity is not sent north for meets
with the Washington and Oregon
teams, it will probably go to Reno
on April 26th. If these meets are
arranged the Freshmen will go to
Reno on the 12th.
