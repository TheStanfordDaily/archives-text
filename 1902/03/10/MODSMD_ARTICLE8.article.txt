When death visits our commu
nity, where everyone is preparing
for years of active life; when sud
denly and without warning it takes
one whose personal qualities at
tracted those who knew him, whose
capacity made him prominent
among his fellows, and whose judg
ment and ability gave promise of a
future never to be realized, it is
the occasion of intense sadness.
Formal resolutions and words of
eulogy will not give full expression
of the grief felt by the associates of
J. W. Cameron and by the student
body at large. He was in every
sense a man, broad, generous, and
sincere, lleumrkable for his self
control, he was, withal, so modest
that his strength was not realized
until the sheer force of his charac
ter made him appreciated. He
never thrust himself forward, but
never refused a responsibility.
Calm but not passive, conserva
tive bin always ready to act when
there was occasion, public spirited
and self-sacrificing, he was the kind
of man in whom Stanford feels her
greatest pride. The estimate of his
ability and the confidence in his
judgment is shown by the many
positions in which his fellow stu
dents placed him. It may be truly
said that these were unsought.
Last week Cameron was among
us, active and apparently vigorous.
Only those close to him knew that
he had suffered at all, but they had
no conception of the pain he must
have endured in silent fortitude for
many weeks. So unexpected has
been his call that it cannot be re
alized at once. There was no anx
ious waiting. The end did not
come as the climax of a period of
suspense, but with a suddenness
that shocks us. The life that had
concealed its pain from those
around it went out and left us all
to mourn.
