# RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED.
## Action Taken by the Organizations to Which J.W. Cameron Belonged. 
### 
All the organizations in which
J. \V. Cameron was especially in
terested will forward letters or res
olutions of sympathy to the family.
Saturday evening each of the three
literary societies adopted expres
sions of mourning and adjourned.
Yesterday afternoon the Law stu
dents, and last evening the Encina
Club, drew up resolutions, and to
day the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students, and the
Junior class, took similar action.
Floral pieces have been ordered by
the Law students, by Euphronia,
and other organizations. The ex
pressions already recorded follow.
Student Body.
The students of Stanford Univer
sity extend the most profound sym
paty to the family of James Wil
liam Cameron, whom death has
taken from us. He was a man in
the prime of his college career, giv
ing promise of a brilliant future,
and holding the respect and love of
every person with whom he was as
sociated. He had shown a nobility'
of character in every pursuit which
he undertook, had proved his ex
ceptional ability in more than one
direction, and had won the loyal
regard of all who knew him. The
students who have twice chosen
him to leadership during life, claim
the right of paying this last tribute
to his memory. If it can be a con
solation to his family in this hour
to know that he held the highest
place in the estimation of his asso
ciates, and that for manliness, and
tenderness, and talent, and integri
ty, his life had not been lived in
vain, then this consolation can he
theirs in the fullest measure.

Junior Class.
Whereas, God in His infinite
wisdom has seen fit to remove from
among us our friend and classmate
James W. Cameron; and,
Whereas, We, in a small measure,
realize and partake of the sorrow
which thus falls upon his family;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That we desire to ex
press to them the esteem in which
we held him for his quiet manli
ness and earnest character; and,
be it further
Resolved, That we extend to
them our heartfelt sympathy in
this hour of bereavement, and we
commend them to Him Who alone
can give comfort and aid at
such a time.

Law Students.
The Law students adopted these
resolutions, which will be engrossed
on parchment and sent to the rel
atives:
Whereas, Death has taken from
our midst our beloved friend and
fellow student, James W. Cameron,
be it
Resolved, That we tender to his

family our deepest sympathy in
their great bereavement. While
they have lost a noble son and
brother, we lose one who has won
our respect and love by his fine,
strong qualities as a student, lead
er, patriot, and friend. He has
been called from us when just about
to enter on a career which we know
would have reflected pride and
honor upon his Alma Mater. In
his loss we are tempted to say with
the poet:
"The good die first;
And those whose hearts are dry
as summer dust
Burn to the socket."
But God's ways are not our ways,
and his purposes we are not given
to understand. One thing we
know: To those of us who were for
tunate enough to know him, his
strength of mind, his integrity of
purpose, his spirit of unselfishness,
will always be an inspiration.
Encina Club.
We, the members of the Encina
Club, while conscious of the in
adequacy of any expression we may
make of our grief at the loss of
James William Cameron, feel that
the occasion cannot pass without
an attempt to voice our feelings,
trusting that the sorrowing rela
tives may be in a measure cheered
by the knowledge that the life of
our dear friend, while cut off thus
suddenly, has been helpful to us
far beyond its years. Both as a
fellow-member and as president of
our organization his deportment
has been such as to win for him
universal recognition as a man of
sterling worth, of intellectual force,
and of the native genius that makes
a leader.
Those who were closest to him
loved him, and were better for the
association. Those who saw his
daily life saw a life filled with high
ideals, and an earnest striving to
reach them. The honors given him
by his fellow students, slight though
they were, attest in some measure
the esteem in which he was held.
We would join our hearts' regrets
with yours, believing that, though
his life in the narrower sense has
ended, his influence will go on and
will lead to better lives.

Euphronia.
The members of Euphronia Liter
ary Society are bowed in grief at
the death of a fellow member,
James William Cameron. But a
few hours ago we saw him in the
fullness of life. Now his absence
from our number forces us to
realize that he is no more. Some
months ago, as presiding officer of
this society, he spoke with subdued
emotion when he proposed adjourn
ment out of respect for the mar
tyred President McKinley, whose
call to eternity had just come.
Then we mourned with him for the
nation's loss, for a man whom we
honored but did not know except
as a public character. Tonight,
each of us misses an associate, a
companion, a friend. Unassuming
as he was, we recognized in him a
leader, and his future seemed rich
with promise.

To the family, whose grief we in
a measure share, we extend sym
pathy and condolence, and offer
the assurance that this career, ap
parently so untimely in its end,
lias by its unselfishness, its sincer
ity of purpose, and its intellectual
force, exercised upon us, his asso
ciates in Euphronia, an influence
that will continue in each of our
lives.
Philolexian.
In view of the sudden and shock
ing death of our fellow student, J.
W. Cameron, as a token of our deep
sense of personal loss in recogni
tion of his sterling qualities as a
man, and his substantial contribu
tions to the interests of the Stan
ford student body, and especially
to the debating interests, be it
Resolved, That the Philolexian
Literary Society stands adjourned
in memory of J. W.Cameron.
Nestoria.
Whereas, In the death of James
William Cameron, Stanford Uni
versity has lost one of her most
worthy and loyal sons and one of
her most faithful and promising
debaters,
Therefore, be it resolved, That
the Nestoria Debating Society, be
cause of the love and esteem in
which we held him, and because of
our appreciation of his devotion to
debating interests, do hereby ad
journ,
And be it further resolved, That
this resolution be spread on the
minutes of the society, when it is
published in the Daily Palo Alto,
and that it be forwarded to the be
reaved family.

Edward H. Rice,
Committee.
