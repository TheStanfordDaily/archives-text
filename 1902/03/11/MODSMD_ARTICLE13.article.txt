With the provision yesterday,
the Athletic Committee places the
selection of a Varsity tennis team
each year on a basis similar to that
for the choice of debating teams.
It gives recognition to the man
who has played in intercollegiate
matches, exempting him .from the
preliminary singles tournament,
just as the Varsity debater is free

from the necessity of entering the
preliminary debates. The plan is
intended to be a permanent one. It
does not apply to the present year
alone, as may have been inferred
from the statement in the Daily
Palo Alto last evening, but will
be followed in the future. No defi
nite policy has been pursued here
tofore in selecting tennis teams, and
the method varied from one season
to another. This gives the sport a
firm footing in Stanford athletics.
