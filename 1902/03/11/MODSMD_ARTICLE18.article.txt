# HISTORY REQUIREMENTS
## More Liberty Allowed Preparatory Schools in Adapting Collateral Work. 
### 
The Register to be issued this
spring contains a revision of the
statement governing entrance re
quirements in History, which, re-1
taining the principles of the old
requirements is intended to afford
greater liberty to the individual
teacher in adapting collateral work
to the conditions in each school
and the attainments of the pupils.
Less stress than formerly is laid
upon notes taken of all reading.
The most important change made
is the permission given in the case
of accredited schools to present a
detailed statement of the work that
has been done in place of the sub
mission of the note-book itself.
With regard to these points the Reg
ister will say:
"All candidates for credit in en
trance History must submit evi
dence of considerable work done in
addition to the text-book prepara
tion. For the sake of the training
involved as well as for the informa
tion acquired and stimulating of
interest, the following exercises are
recommended: supplementary read
ing, including the use of original
material where possible; notes and
digests of reading; abstracts or an
alyses of specified chapters, both of
the text-book and supplementary
reading; outlines of subjects, gath
ering material from all available
sources; and map drawing from
printed data or comparison of ex
isting maps, showing movements of
exploration, migration or conquest,
territorial changes or social phe
nomena.
"Such work should be regarded
as a means rather than the end of
historical study, and in every in
stance should be adapted in char
acter and amount to the stage of
advancement of the class and of
the individual pupil. As the pupil
progresses in his study, more ad
vanced work may well be required
in the form of historical composi
tion and of note-taking in the class
from talks by the teacher or re
ports of fellow-pupils.
"The evidence of such work must
be presented in the form of a note
book or bound collection of notes,
containing all exercises prepared
upon any of the four History sub
jects arranged in order.of their as
signment, and certified and ap
proved bv the teacher. In the case
of schools whose recommendations
are accepted in place of the exami
nations, a detailed statement by
the teacher as to the character,
amount and quality of the work of
each candidate may be substituted
for the note-book."
