# Baseball Practice Again.

The first and second teams came
out for practice yesterday after a
few days' interruption, and played
a game of seven innings after a
little preliminary practice. Mc-
Farland pitched against the Var
sity, while Rowland was in the box
for the first team, lioth pitchers
did some commendable work, and
each struck out seven men in the
short time of play. McFarland
was in fine shape. He was very
steady all through, had plenty of
speed, and kept the hits of the Var
sity few and scattered. Rowland
was a little wild at first, but after
he had cooled down he did some
excellent work.
The infield playing of the Var
sity was rather weak at times.
Four or five bad errors were made,
the majority of which were poor
throws. The playing in the second
team was first-class, and the men
succeeded in preventing a score by
the Varsity for five innings. A
great deal of the careless work done
by the Varsity was doubtless due
to the fact that this was the first
practice for several days. Now
that good, warm baseball weather
has putin an appearance, the can
didates for the team may be ex
pected to do the fast playing that
they are capable of. As a whole
the practice was satisfactory.
McGilvray did some clever work
behind the bat, and was quick in
throwing to the bases. He im
proves every day, giving promise
of making one of the best backstops
the Cardinal has had for some
time.
