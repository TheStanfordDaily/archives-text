## 
### 
The Faculty baseball nine de
feated the Zeta Psi fraternity last
Friday in a hotly contested game
by the score of ten to eight. The
beginning of the contest pointed to
a big score, but after Professor
Howard got warmed up the runs
were kept well scattered. There
was much heavy hitting on both
sides, and the Faculty succeeded in
getting three two-base hits down
to its credit. The professors showed
up rather badly in the error col
umn, piling up six errors in the
short game, while the Zetes kept
their number down to three. Only
five innings were played.
