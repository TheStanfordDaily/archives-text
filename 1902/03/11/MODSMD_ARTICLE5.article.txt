# TENNIS TOURNAMENTS.
## The
						Athletic Committee Adopts a System of Preliminaries and Finals. 
### 
The resolution adopted yesterday
afternoon by the Athletic Commit
tee provides in effect that each
year there shall be held tourna
ments of singles, from which the
members of the Varsity of previ
ous years shall be excused. The
three best men selected through
these tournaments shall compete
with members of the previous Var
sity team for first and second
places. The winners of first and
second places shall then compose
a doubles team, which shall com
pete with the winners of a doubles
tournament for the intercollegiate
position.
The drawing for the first of
these tournaments has already
been made. Entries for the second
will be open as soon as the first is
played off. The co-operation of
every man entered in the tourna
ment is desired by the manager,
the new rule requiring a larger
number of tournaments than usual
to be run off with but a short time
in which to play them.
If possible every match up to the
finals will be played off by Wednes
day night, the finals to be played
on Thursday afternoon, the entries
and drawings for the seccnd tourna
ments to be made and posted by
Friday night. Men who are
matched should arrange to meet on
the courts as soon as possible.
Balls may be obtained at the train
ing-house. The first list of matches
is as follows; Hooper and Hopper,
R. Leib and Fuller, F. Leib and
Watson, Moore and Boyle, Splivalo
to play the winner of the K. Leib-
Fuller match, Baker to play the
winner of the F. Leib-Watson
match.
The winners of the three tourna
ments will play with Weihc for
first and second places on the In
tercollegiate team, Weihe being the
only member of last year's team
now in the University.
