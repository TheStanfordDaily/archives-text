# STRICKEN WITH PARALYSIS.
## Percy E. Nichols,'04. the Hammer-Thrower, in a Precarious Condition. 
### 
Percy E. Nichols, '04, lies in a
critical condition in his room, 47
Camp, as the result of a paralytic
stroke caused by the bursting of a
blood-vessel in the head early this
morning. His room-mate, J. S.
Burcham, '01, was awakened at one
o'clock by the sound of a fall. It
appears that Nichols was stricken
with partial paralysis, the impact
of the stroke being so violent that
he was thrown from his cot,
striking partly on his head, though
the fall in itself was probably not
serious. He soon lost conscious
ness, and the paralysis has extended
almost over the entire body. Dr.
Wilbur announced his condition
unchanged this afternoon, and his
chances of recovery are small. His
mother was summoned from the
family's home in San Jose, and
everything possible is being done
for the patient.
Nichols has been working very
hard all the year, and it is thought
his over-strained condition may
have been the cause of the stroke,
although he was apparently exceed
ingly robust. He has been prac
ticing with the hammer for the In
tercollegiate Field-day, and was
counted on as a sure point-winner.
