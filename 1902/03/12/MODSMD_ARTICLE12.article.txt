# AGAINST CAPS AND GOWNS.
## Senior Men Decide Not to Adopt the Ancient College Custom. 
### 
The men of the Senior class voted
thin afternoon against the adoption
of caps and gowns for the Com
mencement exercises. The meeting
whs called to order in the chapel at
1:15 by President Hinman. A
motion was made that the Class
adopt the caps and gowns to he
worn on the day of graduation. A
discussion followed and the pre
vailing opinion was not in favor of
the custom. Arguments brought
up against the caps and gowns
were that they would be expensive,
that other classes before 1902 had
not seen Ht to adopt them, and
that the custom would in no way
be unique to Stanford. A motion
was made and carried that the
original motion he laid on the
table. The original question was
called for and lost.
Treasurer Boren called attention
to the fact that very few of the
Seniors had paid their assessments,
and spoke of the need of immediate
settlement.
