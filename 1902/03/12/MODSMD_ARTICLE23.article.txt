# California Has Two Universities.
## 
### 
"December haH been a good
month for education." writes Miss
Gilder, in the Critic. "Thirty mil
lion dollars from Mrs. Stanford to
the University of California, and
ten millions from Mr. Carnegie for
a university at Washington."
Any month is ii good month for
education in the West, but it is hard
to perceive that December differed
from any other month in its effect
on the intelligence of the ICasL.
In Berlin, Manila, and Sidney it
is known that the belaud Stanford
Junior University was founded ten
years ago; that it is about twice as
well endowed as any other univer
sity in the world; that its president
is David Starr Jordan (who has
also been heard of there); that it
turns out graduates as well
equipped as any; that the Stanford
millions are in Stan for I U niversily
and in no other. * * * There
is also more or less awareness in
Hongkong and Budapest that
Mrs. Hearst and Mrs. Stanford are
not aliases for tbe same person;
that Berkeley and Palo Alto are
not like some Mexican land-grants,
two or three deep in tbe same town
ship. In a word that California
has two Universities--both big,
both successful, both deserving suc
cess, both with sinews of war; in
proportion to population about four
times ahead of any State east of tbe
of the Missouri. â€” Out Went.
U. C. Sophomores a Circus.
The sophomores at the Univer
sity of California are to give a
class "circus" instead of the usiu.l

"farce", and (lie Califomian says:
''There can be no doubt but that
there is a great deal more talent in
the cbiKH for a show of this kind
than could have possibly been de
veloped for an artistic perform
ance."
