Speaking of the gift to be made
by the Chinese government to Co
lumbia University in recognition
of the establishment of a depart
ment of Chinese there, the San
Francisco Chronicle says:
"It appears that the collection
selected by the Foreign OHice of
China for presentation to Columbia
University is known as the "T's
Shu Chi Cheng." it is the most
comprehensive collection of books
that has ever been made in China.
The collection consists of over (>OOO
volumes, and treats of every subject
known to Chinese literature. The
work was originally undertaken by
a commission of eminent Chinese
scholars appointed by Emperor [
Kang Hai, who reigned from 1682
to 1733. From a scientific point of
view the gift is invaluable."
