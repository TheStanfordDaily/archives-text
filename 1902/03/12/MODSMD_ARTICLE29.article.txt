tried at Yale in preparation for the
Harvard-Yale debate, says the
Harvard Crimson. Under the pro-1

interdepartment debates for the:
university championship. The;
law, divinity, academic, and scien

by competitive trials from the de
bating clubs in these departments.

The academic department will then
debate against the scientific school,
and the law school against the di
vinity school; and the winners of
these two debates will meet to de

preliminary trials will be selected
to debate against Harvard.
