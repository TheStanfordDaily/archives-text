# SANTA CLARA AGAIN.
## Varsity Meets Catholic Collegians For the Third Time Tomorrow. 
### 
The Cardinal will again meet the
Santa Clara College baseball nine
on the campus tomorrow. Both,
nines have improved much since
the game on February 20th, and
a hard fought game may be looked
for. The batting order of the two
teams will be as follows:
Varsity—Brown, 3b; Crawford,
ss; McCil vray, c; Cowden, 2b; Low
enthal, If; Knight, if; Blake, lb;
Copp, cf; McFarland or Parker, p.
Santa Clara—Keefe or Cutter, cf;
Faery, ss; Cutter or Keefe, p; Ken
nedy, c; Strand, rf; Caltes, lb;
Feeney, If; Strub, 2b; Merle, 3b.
The Varsity did some good woek
yesterday against the second team
and piled up hits and runs at a fast
rate. Parker did the twirling for the
second. This is the first appear
ance he has made on the diamond
for several days and he did not
show up in his best form. The
wildness he exhibited in the early
part of the game was tamed down
after a couple innings of play, and
after that he did some first-class
pitching.
The batting of the Varsity was
much improved. The men hit
safer and placed their singles far
better than usual. Three two-base
hits were knocked out by the Hist
team, and nearly every man on
the nine got a hit sometime dur
ing the match. The hitting
has always been the weak
est point of former Stanford
nines. Early in the season the can
didates gave indications of making
this a hitting team, but lately
things have changed for some rea
son, and good safe hits have been
the exception, making iast night's
showing the more encouraging.
Cowden is the only one of the old
men that can be depended on for a
hit every time he comes to bat. He
always hits safely, and has the
knack of placing his hits. In this
department Knight is not tip to his
early form, but his fielding con
tinues very good. There is much
chance for improvement in the
stick work of all the new men.
They are fielding their positions
well but invariable fall down after
they come to bat. Brown is still
behind in his batting and has not
yet reached his last year's record.
McFarland and Triteh were in
the box for the Varsity last night.
Neither tried to do any speedy
pitching.
