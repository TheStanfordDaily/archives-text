# PARALYSIS WAS FATAL.
## Nichols Expired Last Night—Funeral Services at Encina Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
I'ercy E. Nichols died shortly
before nine o'clock last evening at
Encina Hall, where he had been
taken from his room in the camp
three hours earlier. The funeral
service will he held at Encina Hall
tomorrow at two in the afternoon,
and a large attendance is expected.
Professor Show will conduct the
service at the Hall and afterwards
the hearse will be followed by the
family carriage and a line of stu
dents to the arboretum, where the
body will he laid in the little grave
yard.
After the attack of paralysis at
one o'clock yesterday morning,
Nichols was conscious at no time,
and the only sign of life he gave
throughout the day was a slight
respiration and action of the pulse.
This morning Dr. Wilbur held an
autopsy, examining the heart and
brain, and finding that the stroke,
as he had diagnosed it yesterday,
was due to cerebral embalism and
hemorrhage. The endocardium or
covering of the heart had been af
fected and a small piece of diseased
tissue, having been loosened, had
escaped into the circulation and
clogged up one of the principal ar
teries at the base of the brain. It
was the impact of this that caused
the shock which threw Nichols out
of bed on Tuesday night, giving
the first warning of his trouble.
The cutting off of the circulation to
the brain produced paralysis and
Inter death. Dr. Wilbur says that
overwork was a prominent factor
in causing the trouble, for the heart
was diseased and had become en
larged because of the severe phys
ical work and strain. .Nichols' con
dition was absolutely hopeless, and
no medical or surgical procedure
could have saved him. Had he
1 iveil he would probably have been
completely paralyzed on one
side.
The deceased was just twenty-one
years of age. He came to Stanford
in September, 1900, having been
graduated from the Santa Clara
high school class of 1899. His
earlier education was received at
the public schools of San Jose.
One of his class-mates at the high
school speaks of him as being the
best student in mathematics and
one of the best in general scholar
ship in bis class which was a large
one. While preparing for college
he took an active interest in tha
athletics of the high school, play
ing football and throwing the
weights.
When he entered Stanford he
took up his abode in the (-amp,
where he has since lived making a
hard struggle to fulfill his ambi
tion of gaining a college education.
Geology was his major subject and
he was a good student. Being of
strong physique he excelled in the
athletic events in which size and
strength count most. He made the
Varsity track team last year as
hammer thrower and was showing
the most prominence this year
among the candidates in that event,
lie recently made a record of one

hundred and twenty-five feet with
the hammer.
lie leaves a mother, who has
been 011 the campus since yesterday
morning, and a little sister besides
a few other relatives in San Jose.
In the small amount of time for
social life which a self-supporting
student has at his disposal, Nichols
had little opportunity to form a
large number of friendships in uni
versity circles. He was probably
not known to many outside of his
classes, the athletic men, the stu
dents from his home, and the small
group of working students who
were his daily associates. It is a
significant fact that those who
knew him, even slightly, had the
one estimation of him —"He was a
good man." No one of his univer
sity acquaintances thought less of
him than this, and only his close
associates really understood and
appreciated the full worth of his
character.
One of the little group of inti
mate friends speaks of him thus:
"To us his life stood for even more
than a laudable ambition for learn
ing and quiet industry. It is the
old truth of the depth of still
waters; the worth of the man who
expresses himself only after long
and purposeful thought. One stu
dent who knew him only during
the present school year, marked in
conversation with him, that when
his confidence was established he
turned the thought to the spiritual
significance of a man's life, and the
[lower of a strong soul over others.
This was the every-day life of
Nichols. That a man could make
of life with its severe struggles and
common circumstances, the possi
bility, even more, the actual posses
sion, of such a deep power, this is
an inspiration to us. He believed
above all in the worth and power
of a man, and in the spiritual value
of goodness. And that this belief
was sincere was evidenced in several
ways in his conduct.
"lie was characterized by an un
broken serenity, a cheer of temper
that affected those around him. It
was not the lightness of one who
fails to appreciate the serious prob
lem of evil, but rather the calm
that sees life as it is, and is glad in
the belief that there is an abiding
goodness in men. He could see,
judge, renounce without bitterness;
and it is a fact that he worked and
mingled without loosing that good
temper. His character spoke also
in his quiet voice, his appreciation
of pleasure, and in the honesty of
independent work. His devotion to
his mother, and his plans for the
happiness of his little sister, mod
estly revealed, were qualities that
speak eloquently of him."
