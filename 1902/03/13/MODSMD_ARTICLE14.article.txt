Death, quick and unexpected,
has seized another fellow-student;
it 11 as stricken a powerful man, ap
parently one of the most robust
among us. Percy Nichols was so
quiet and unobtrusive, so studious
and industrious, that his circle oi
acquaintances did not extend far.
His friends testify that his brain
was as strong as his body and that
his earnestness would have made
him widely influential as he be
came better known. Already we
recognized that he would have
made a success as an athlete.
Facing the problem of self-support,
he worked hard to maintain him
self; ambitious as a student, he
worked with intense interest in his
studies; and, loyally striving to rep
resent his UDiversity in athletics, he
worked with equal faithfulness in
his training. The coincidence of
the past few days, when two men
of exceptional promise have been
tiiken from us, is most solemnly
impressive of the uncertainty of
life.
