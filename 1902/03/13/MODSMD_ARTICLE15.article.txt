# Caged the President
## 
### 
The students of Wabash College
at Crawfordsville, Indiana, re
cently revolted against the decision
of the faculty not to dismiss recita
tions for founder's day, and accord
ing to an item in the Chicago Trib
une, proceeded to observe the an
niversary.
Immediately after chapel, yell
ing and singing, they started to
invade the recitation rooms and
break up all classes. The few stu
dents who had gone to classes were
hauled out by their companions
and tied to trees on the campus,
while their captors danced and
howled around them.
President Kane was hearing a

few faithful recite in philosophy
when the collegians came upon
him and locked him in his room,
placing upon the door the inscrip
tion: "Jojo, the caged monkey."
After having been imprisoned for
an hour Dr. Kane escaped by
climbing from a window, while the
student body assembled, bellowed
and shouted with delight.
In the afternoon, a student who
had heen guilty of studying in the
morning, was dragged to Dr. Kane's
residence and tied up with ropes to
a pillar of the front porch. Later
Dr. Kane cut his bonds while the
students hooted.
