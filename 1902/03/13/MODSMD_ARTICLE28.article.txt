### 
Some weeks ago the Brown Her
ald contained the following item on
the misunderstanding between Yale
and Harvard:
"Owing to the increasing ill-feel
ing between Yale and Harvard,
their crews may not race against
each other this year. If this hap
pens Yale will probably send her
eight to Henley, and Harvard will
enter the intercollegiate regatta at
Poughkeepsie with Cornell, Colum
bia, and Pennsylvania. Harvard
men are making charges of profes
sionalism against Sharpe, De
Saulles, and Spraker, of Yale, in
answer to Yale's charges against
the Crimson athletes."
The trouble seems to have been
overcome, however, for the Michigan
Daily News, in a later number,says:
"As the result of the conference
last week Yale and Harvard have
agreed to patch up all differences.
A meeting will be held within a few
days to settle ;ill questions, includ
ing eligibility. ArragemenU for
the rowing, track, and baseball
contests this spring will be per
fected, and these meets will take
place as usual."
