# Yesterday's Practice.
## 
### 
The baseball teams did not line
up yesterday, and on account of
the game today with Santa Clara
College, Coach Swindells put the
men through light practice. Some
fast infield work was done, after
which the players were given bat
ting practice. The candidates for
pitcher's box were out for a short
time, and contented themselves with
simply warming up. The coach
tried the infield on high flies, and
the afternoon's work was generally
very satisfactory. The players are
in good form for a game, and if the
hot weather of the past few days
continues, a great change is looked
for in the playing of the Varsity.
Lowenthal was out again last night
but he is still a little sore from the
injuries received last week.
