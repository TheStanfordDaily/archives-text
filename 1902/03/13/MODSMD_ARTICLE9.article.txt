# Trials Run Yesterday.
## 
### 
The trials run on the truck yes
terday afternoon were most highly
satisfactory. Moulton has only a
little over a month in which to get
the team into shape anil will do
the best he can with the material
and limited time. The had weather
and the condition of the track have
in great measure prohibited the
development of new material, and
he will have to depend largely on
the old men for the winning of
points. The performances of Mo
ran, '04, Smith, '03, Crossman, '04,
Dunn, '04, Thomson, '03, Davis, '03,
Chadhoume, '02, and Nangle, '03,
last night were good. Smith ran
the quarter in 53 2-5 seconds;
Thomson, the half in 2:12 2-5, Da
vis in 2:13 1-5; Chadbourne, the
mile in 5:09.
