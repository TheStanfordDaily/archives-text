# THROWING WAS POOR.
## This Fact Spoiled Several Good Plays by the Varsity in Yesterday's Ball Game. 
### 
For the third time this season
the Varsity was defeated yesterday
afternoon by Santa Clara College,
this time in a close and exciting
game by the score of 2 to 0. It
was by far the best contest of the
three, full of interest for the hand
ful of spectators that braved the
usual baseball rain. The weather
did not stop the playing, but made
it exceedingly disagreeable both
for the men on the diamond and for
the audience.
Although marked by an absence
of heavy hitting and sensational
plays, it was a good game to watch.
The Varsity made some very had
plays,"but their showing was as a
whole encouraging. The great
drawback with the men yesterday
was their inability to connect with
the hall. In the second inning
there were three men on bases with
only one man out, yet the side was
retired without scoring. Again in
fourth inning the Cardinal had
a chance to score with men on sec
ond and third and only one out.
In each instance the old habit of
batters falling down at critical
times again showed itself, and the
inning ended without a Stanford
man crossing the plate. At no
other point in the nine innings did
the Varsity come near scoring.
Parker pitched an excellent
game against the visitors. He was
fast and steady, and did not walk
away to first. The Varsity spoiled
several fine plays by bad throws,
but with this exception work was
good in both the infield and out.
The Santa Clara collegians put
up an errorless game. Their field
ing was brilliant, and the nine
worked together in machine fashion.
The best they could do off Parker,
however, was five singles. The
score follows:
