In voting to drop the proposed
amendment, to the Intercollegiate
Agreement, which requires men
coming here from other universities
to remain one year before they may
take part in athletic events, the
Executive Committee brushes aside
a measure that demands the most
careful consideration, if, indeed,
there is any valid ground for oppo
sition at all. The amendment was
proposed by the 1 ntercollegiateCom
mittee, in which Stanford is repre
sented by men of long experience
in dealing with our athletic prob
lems. While the Executive Com
mittee has the power of veto, a
decision reached by these men
should be overruled only in ex
treme cases when there is some
strong reason for doing so. Before
any measure is rejected, however,
it should be discussed, with all ar
guments given on each side. The
conditions demanding the change
were not considered sufficiently by
the Executive Committee. The
measure is felt by those of experi
ence to be necessary in the interest
of purely amateur athletics, it is
similar to a provision in force at
other universities. It protects us
against the danger of becoming
tinctured with professionalism. We
must not grow to depend on ath
letes who may come here from
other institutions, but must develop
men who enter primarily as stu
dents, not to win athletic honors.
The clause has the approval of the

Faculty Committee. The only dif
ficulty presented is in deciding
what may he included hy the
phrase, "universities of standing," i
hut this is a minor point and
would be passed upon by the fac
ulty, removing the fear of annoy
ance to student associations. The
Executive Committee should recon- j
aider its vote of rejection.
