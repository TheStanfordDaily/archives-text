# Expressions of Grief.
## 
### 
We, wlio were his fellow mem
bers of the Class of 1904, wish to
express in some slight measure the
grief we feel at the death of our
friend and classmate, l\ E. Nichols.
While fully conscious of the in
adequacy of any expression of our
own grief to lighten that of his
sorrow-stricken parent, still we
wish to extend her our sympathy
and condolence, itnd to assure her
that the life thus cut short at the
entrance into a manhood full of
promise and of hope will ever live
among us, his associates and fellow
classmen, as an influence and stim
ulus for loftiness of purpose and
sincerity of effort.

We, the members of the Stanford
Track Team, realizing the dilliculty
of expressing ourselves at the loss
of our fellow worker and comrade,
Percy Nichols, cannot but try to
voice our feelings. Always shall
we remember his untiring interest
and efforts for the University, al
ways shall we remember him as a
true friend whom we loved and re
spected, and one whose place can
not be idled.
(rod has seen lit to take him
from our midst, and God's ways
are notour ways, and His purposes
we are not given to understand.
But we do know that those who
were closest associated with "Per
cy" could not lÂ»e hut better for the
association.
To the family, whose grief we in
part share, we extend our heart
felt sympathy and condolence.
We would like them to know of the
esteem and love in which the de
parted was held. His life with lis
was short. Yet in that time we,
who knew him, came to trust and
love him for his unassuming way,
his noble character, and steadfast
ways. Mis influence has helped
us in the past, his memory will
help us in the future.

We, the men of "The Camp," wish
to express in some way our feelings
at the loss of our friend and associ
ate, Percy Nichols. We, who were
most closely associated with him,
loved him not because of any pre
dominant qualities of leadership,
hut because of the vein of tine man
hood that flowed through his na
ture and bespoke itself in every
word and action, lie recognized
the uncertainties of life and was
not afraid either to live or to die.
We wish to express our deepest
sympathy to the mother and sister
to whose future his life was devoted.
