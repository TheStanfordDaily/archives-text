# MEET AT SANTA CLARA.
## Freshman Truck Team Will Compete With the Catholic Athletes Wednesday. 
### 
The Freshman track team will
go to Santa Clara on Wednesday
afternoon for a meet with the Santa
Clara athletes. Cutter, the best
man in the Catholic college, him
self capable of winning a lield-day
through his own performances, has
been limited to entrance in four
events. The Freshman captain,
T. McCaughern, has not yet fully
decided upon the men who will
be taken down. The entries will
be published tomorrow.
The Sophomores are getting into
team shape for Saturday's meet
with Ukiah. Many of the events
on that day will be closely con
tested.
A number of successful trials
were run on Saturday morning,
Davis, '03, in the mile, McCaugh
ern, '08, in the two-twenty, and
Henley, '04, in the broad jump,
each excelling anything that has
been done in their events this
season.
