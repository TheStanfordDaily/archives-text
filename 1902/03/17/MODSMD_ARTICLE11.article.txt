# WON FROM SAN JOSE.
## In a Loosely Played Contest, Varsity Defeated Normal School by Score of 11 to 4. 
### 
The Varsity defeated the Sal)
Jose Normal team Saturday in a
ragged and loosely played game by
the score of 11 to 4. There were
enough errors made to have lost
three close games, and that the Car
dinal won is due to the gilt-edged
pitching of McFarland, who kept
the hits down to four, and to the
very creditable work of Stanford's
men at the bat. McFarland was
in excellent form, and proved a
hard puzzle to the Normal school
men. He twice struck out his hat
ter after he had given him three
balls, and kept the few hits well
scattered.
The game offered much amuse
ment and interest to the spectators,
but as a good exhibition of the na
tional game it was a dismal failure.
Stanford could have reduced her
opponent's score by two runs if her
players had not done such bad
throwing in the third inning. In
this inning the Cardinal went up
in the air, and the visitors got their
only runs. The throwing was one
of the home team's greatest draw
backs.
The hitting of the Stanford team
was a revelation to the spectators.
Martin, the promised leaguer, was
found for thirteen hits, four of which
were clean two-baggers. In the
ninth inning he retired to Emer
son, who proved an easy proposi
tion for the Cardinal in the few
minutes he was in the box.
The fielding of the home team
could have been improved upon a
great deal. The base-running, how
ever, was a feature of Stanford's
playing, nine stolen bases being to
her credit at the close of the con
test. The score follows:
