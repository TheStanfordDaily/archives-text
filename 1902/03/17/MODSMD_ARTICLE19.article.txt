The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
played to a delighted audience at
Del Monte Saturday night. It was
an audience of wealthy Eastern
people, with whom the beautiful
hotel is now crowded. Both of the
clubs were at their best, and the
audience was enthusiastic, encoring
every selection and personally com
plimenting the men after the con
cert was over. In this way the
clubs help extend and maintain
the reputation of Stanford.
