# Made a Hit at Del Monte.
## 
### 
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
returned yesterday afternoon from
their short concert trip to Santa
Cruz and Del Monte. They played
at Santa Cruz Friday night to a
small but enthusiastic audience,
and on Saturday night they took
Del Monte by storm. The ball
room of the famous resort was very
comfortably filled, and the ap
plause throughout was hearty and
spontaneous. Every number on
the program was received enthusi
astically, the concert constituting
one of the biggest "hits" the clubs
have yet made. These were the
only two concerts on the trip.
