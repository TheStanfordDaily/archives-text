Notwithstanding the number of
errors shown in the score, and other
weak features in the game, the per
formance of the Varsity last Sat
urday in gaining thirteen hits oft
Martin, the San Jose Normal
pitcher who has made such a record
in the box, is encouraging. If the
fielding and throwing are improved
to a commensurate degree during
the next three weeks, we may look
for genuine baseball when the first
game occurs with California. Coach
Swindells is laboring hard against
the disadvantages of bad weather
and comparative inexperience of
the material. The men likewise
are doing their utmost. A fairly
good crowd saw the contest Satur
day, but the interest shown by the
student body at large should be in
creased —an interest manifesting
appreciation for the players in their
efforts. While there was not much
occasion for a display of enthusiasm
in the recent game, there was a
decided lack of it. Machine-made
yells may not accomplish much —
some people positively object to
them—nevertheless organized root
ing has an important place. Not
only do our own men merit the
recognition of a cheer now and
then, but as a matter of courtesy
every team that comes to play on
the campus should be shown the

courtesy of such a welcome. Is it
not time to have a yell leader who
will direct such expressions?
