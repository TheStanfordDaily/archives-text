Every one who attended the
memorial meeting for J. \V. Cam
eron, held by the Intersociety De
hating League Saturday evening,
carried away a deep impression.
The exercises were brief, appropri
ate, and sincere. E. W. Rice, pres
ident of the league, spoke of the
qualities of manliness which dis
tinguished Cameron and of the
soundness and ability he showed as
a member of the Executive Com
mittee and of the debating commit
tee. A. C. Hall, who had been
closely associated with the deceased,
paid a tribute to his personal char
acter, as did also H. M. Lewis. Pro
fessor Lewers told how Cameron
had impressed the members of the
Law faculty, who looked upon him
as one of the strongest men here,
one who would be an honor and a
credit to the profession which he
intended to follow. At the con
clusion of the remarks, M. F. Me-
Cormick, who presided, announced
the adjournment, and the audience
silently left the room.
