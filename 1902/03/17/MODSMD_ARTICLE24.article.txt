# POWERFUL SERMON.
## Dr. Hemphill Gave Eloquent Discourse on Doubt of the Age. 
### 
Dr. Hemphill, of the Calvary
Presbyterian church, San Fran
cisco, yesterday morning preached
one of the most powerful and elo
quent sermons heard in the chapel
this year, lie spoke on some char
acteristics of our times, from the
text, "And they worshipped Him,
but some doubted." The minister
said that while doubt is not the
characteristic of the present age
more than it may be of others, the
doubt of today has characteristics
of its own. In the first place, peo
ple are inclined to think super
ficially. Modern theories need the
winnowing of centuries to drive
away the chaff and leave ihe facts.
Heady made summaries are popu
lar, but, like ready made clothing,
are liable to fit badly.
Again, the thinking for the last
fifty years has been chiefly mater
ialistic. Everything must be
measured by the pound. Most
men think of the active and not
of the contemplative phases of life.
Even in the movement for "practi
cal religion" there is a tendency to
ignore the inner spiritual life.
"1 am glad to notice a reaction
against this materialism," said Dr.
Hemphill. "We seem to be enter
ing on the psychical. Theosophy.
spiritualism, and all these cults —
while 1 am a disciple of none, and
much of their reasoning is crude —
yet 1 almost say that 1 welcome
them as a protest against the cur
rent of the sewage of materialism
which has swept underneath our
cities for so many years."
Dr. Hemphill characterized many
of the assaults on scientific unbelief
of today as being as foolish as the
negro preacher Jasper's, who main
tained that the world could not be
round because Revelations speaks
of the four corners of the earth.
Scientists are masters in their own
field. Ministers are only novices.
God's answer to all forms of unbe
lief is merely "Jesus Christ."
