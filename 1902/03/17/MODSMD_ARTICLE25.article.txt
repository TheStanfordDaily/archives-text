Rev. A. H. Barnlmel, '93, spoke
in the chapel Sunday evening on
"Some Distinctive Features of
ChristianityHe said in part:
"Of all religions, Christianity is the
most successful in giving character.
However men differ in their esti
mation of creeds, they are one in
their estimation <>112 character and
righteousness. The Jews tried
hard to be righteous, hut they did
not hnve the right system. Theirs
was outward and not inward.
Religion consists in possession and
expression, in faith and in the
working out of principles. We
must have faith that God is super
natural, hut not unnatural. It is
not that we should believe in mira
cles, but in the God that wrought

them. The truly righteous must
have first, a sublime faith in God
as our Father and the Father of
Jesus Christ; and secondly, there
must be an open manifestation and
living of the faith."
