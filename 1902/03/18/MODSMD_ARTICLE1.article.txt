# SPOKE ENTERTAININGLY.
## Howard Kyle, the Actor, Lectured Today on "Nathan Hale, the College Man." 
### 
Howard Kyle, the actor, lectured
this afternoon to an audience that
comfortably tilled the chapel. He
was announced to speak on "Na
than Hale, the College Man," and
in handling this subject he spoke
most entertainingly, not only of
the college days of the patriot-spy,
but of the stage and the sympathy
of the actor for the character he
portrays. Seldom has a more in
terested audience filled the chapel.
Mr. Kyle began happily by al
luding to himself as out of his ele
ment in front of a "congregation."
He referred to the actor as being
accustomed to impersonating other
characters than his own, anil hav
ing always in front of him a barri
cade of footlights, which, when re
moved, leave him at a disadvan
tage. He then told some anec
dotes in a happy vein, and spoke
of the general ignorance of any
thing definite regarding Nathan
Male. While playing in Milwau
kee, he heard a man say that he
"didn't think he'd go to the show
because this Nathan Hale is a bad
actor."
In leading up to his subject of
"Hale, the College Man," Mr. Kyle
dwelt interestingly upon his own
sympathy and feeling for the char
acter, and the research he had
made in order to ascertain and in
terpret the emotions of the martyr,
lie then spoke briefly of Nathan
Hale's days at college, and the
honors he won as champion runner
and jumper and Latin student.
After graduation, young Hale
taught school until the outbreak of
the war, when he enlisted and
fought in the battle of Lexington.
He was promoted to a captaincy
for bravery, and when General
Washington called for the services
of a spy, he volunteered. The
story of his capture was told, and
the dramatic scene when brought
before General Howe was very ef
fectively presented. Mr. Kyle re
lated how the British commander
told Hale he was surprised to see
an educated young man engaged in
the business of a spy.
"This is where Nathan Hale was
grand," said Mr. Kyle. "This is
where he was the true college man.
Drawing himself quietly up to his
full height, every inch of him a
man, he looked General Howe
squarely in the eye and said: 'Any
thing 1 do for my country is not
degrading.' "
In summing up the character of
Nathan Hale, Mr. Kyle said: "He
was a Christian without being a
prig; a college man without being
a snob. He was the typical Amer
ican."
