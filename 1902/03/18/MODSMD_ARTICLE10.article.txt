Santa Clara College defeated the
University of California yesterday
at Santa Clara in a clone and hotly
contested game by the score of 4 to
3. The pitchers controlled the sit
uation throughout, and made the
contest a warm pitchers' battle.
Williams, a new man, was in the
box for California in place of
Overall. He made a very credita
ble showing.
