Coach Swindells was not present
at practice last night, having gone
to witness the game between Santa
Clara College and the University
of California. Captain Cowden put
the nun through fast infield work,
and then gave all the Varsity men
some practice in bunting. On ac
count of the small number of sec
ond team men out, the usual
practice game was not played.
The game at San Jose with the
San Jose Normal School will be
on Thursday, instead of Tuesday as
printed in last evening's issue. On
Saturday the Cardinal will have
their first game with the Olympic
Chib. ______
