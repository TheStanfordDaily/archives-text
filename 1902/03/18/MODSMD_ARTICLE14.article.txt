When the Executive Committee
last week voted "to drop" the one
year residence rule provision to the
intercollegiate athletic agreement,
it not only did so without giving
the subject any degree of considera
tions, but it assumed a prerogative
that belongs to the Athletic Com
mittee. The records show that
whenever a measure has been
agreed upon by the intercollegiate
Committee, it has always, hereto
fore, been referred for ratification
to the Athletic Committee. This is
one of ihe functions of the Athletic
Committee, which appoints the in
tercollegiate representatives, who
are responsible to it. The Execu
tive Committee bases its authority
for acting in the present instance
on the provision of the intercolle
giate agreement adopted in Janu
ary, 1901, which reads:
It shall be the duty of the secre
tary of the Intercollegiate Commit
tee to make to the secretary of the
Associated Students of each univer
sity an immediate detailed report
of any and all amendments passed
in the annual meeting. Such
amendment shall become binding
upon receiving the approval of the
members of the Intercollegiate Com
mittee, if not rejected by the con
trolling committee of either student
body within thirty (30) days after
the mailing of the notice provided
for above. The secretary of the
committee so rejecting a proposed
amendment shall within three
days notify the secretary of the
corresponding committee at the
other university.
Undoubtedly this is vague. The
words "Controlling committee" may
be construed to mean the Executive
Committee as the controlling body
of student affairs here. The inten
tion of the amendment, however,
was for action to be taken by the
committee in charge of the branch
of activity to which the measures
applied. At Stanford this is clear

ly the Athletic Committee; the
phraseology was left vague because
there is only one committee at Cal
ifornia. Otherwise it would have
said simply, "the executive com
mittees" of the Associated Students.
Last year the Athletic Committee,
from which the amendment in
question first emanated, ratified the
provision but did not consider that
in so doing it abandoned its pre
rogative for future ratifications.
There can be no question of prece
dent, and none as to the inten
tion of amendment. The fact
that it is misunderstood so
soon after its adoption points
strongly to the necessity of having
some such advisory board as the
one suggested by Dr. Angell of the
Faculty Athletic Committee in his
article on Athletic Control, to in
sure continuity of policy from one
year to another, and to avoid mis
construction.
It is evident that the Executive
Committee was mistaken in taking
any action at all on the one year
residence rule and the other meas
ures considered at the same time.
These will, no doubt, be taken up
by the Athletic Committee and
112 1111 v discussed.
