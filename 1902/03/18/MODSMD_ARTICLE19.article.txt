While in New York, President
Wheeler of the University of Cali
fornia was interviewed regarding
the Eastern trip of the California
track team. He said it was by all
odds the best that has yet invaded
the Fast from the Golden Gate.
Outside of the question of change
of climate, on neutral ground, with
climatic conditions equal, he says
it would have an equal chance
with any Eastern college team.
"California produces the finest
kind of material," he said. "The
climate makes tall, big men, and a
healthier lot of students is not to
be found anywhere. in football
we are as good on the Coast as any
on the defensive, but are not as
good at scoring. There has come
to he a good deal of artificiality
about football in late years, it
seems to me. It has come to he too
much of a game for a few only,
and one where the average healthy
man is left out. It is not a desir
able condition in college sport
when there is one class of students
who are athletes and another class
who are bench howlers. College

loyalty and enthusiasm are good
things, but we do not want bo
much of what savors of profession
al rooting. After all, the aim of
athletics is not to develop the vocal
cords."
