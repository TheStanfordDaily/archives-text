# New "Sequoia" and "Chaparral."
## 
### 
Both the Sequoia and the Chap
arral are making up lost time Ihese
days, a single week having seen
two issues of each. The numbers
that appeared this morning are
fairly representative of the two
magazines.
In the Sequoia, the place of honor
is given to "A Modern Samaritan,"
an Alaskan story by Mabel H.

Brown. Other (stories of merit are
"The Crescent Ghost," by Leon L.
Loofbourow, and "Where Failed
Poetic Justice," by "M. S.". The
most noteworthy article in the
Sketch-book is "In Whose Clear
Depths," by Waldemar Young.
"Hank," by Miss E. M. Hale, is also
good. A scarcity in verse is no
ticeable, two quatrains by "W. R.
H.,'' entitled "My Lady's Moods,"
and a stanza "To Her," by I. A. W.,
comprising all there i* in this
department.
The editorial is a strong protest
against the stamp of unconven
tronality at Stanford that objects
to the adoption of the cap and
gown for Commencement.
One might characterise the num
ber of the Chaparral, out today, by
quoting from the advertisement on
the cover: "More brilliant than
ever. New equipment," for the editor
has bought a blue pencil. This he
has applied to his prose contribu
tions, but in the verse there is one
spasm, which an editorial attempts
to interpret, that should have been
eliminated. Generally the issue
has made a hit. The poem 'Ashes
of Ivy" is good, and there are
numerous drawings of merit. The
leading editorial on the status of
Encina Club "At Homes" seems
to express the general sentiment on
this subject. Aside from "a very
clever take-off on the editorial page
of the Parlor Altar," the most in
teresting thing is the third editorial.
