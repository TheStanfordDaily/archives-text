# Further Postponement Probable.
## 
### 
It is probable that the dedica
tion of the Memorial Church will
be subject to a second postpone
ment, owing to the impossibility of
having the structure completed by
Easter Sunday. Although no defi
nite decision has heen reached,
there is a strong liklihood of the
exercises being set forward until
some time in April, when the build
ing will be entirely finished.
