# New Verses by Wallace Irwin.
## 
### 
Wallace Irwin, ex-'OO, whose
"Love Sonnets of a Hoodlum" were
so well received, has abandoned
slang to write "The Ruhaiyat of
Omar Khayyam, Jr." The humor
and nonsense will rank with that
of the author's first production.
The book will be illustrated by
Gillett Burgess.
