### 
Baron de Coubertin offers a
Carnot medal at Tulane University
in New Orleans as well as on the
Pacific Coast. The purpose is
the same as here—the encourage
ment of the study of French politics.
The last debate was held on Febru
ary 22d, and seemingly the interest
shown in it was not as great as is
evinced here. The weekly Olive and
Blue of Tulane says:
"Only about forty persons gather
ed in the Assembly Hall last Sat
urday night to hear the debate for
the Carnot medal. This was not a
surprise to those interested in this
contest, for no very considerable
audiences have in former years
listened to the debate. The con
testants were Ralph J. Schwartz
and George H. Wright, negative,
and Marcel Garsand, affirmative.
The question was, 'Resolved, That
it is for the interest of France to
form a close alliance with Italy.'"
