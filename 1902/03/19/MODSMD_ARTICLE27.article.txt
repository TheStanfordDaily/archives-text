# LECTURE ON AGASSIZ.
## Dr. Jordan Talked About the Life and Work of the Great Naturalist. 
### 
An appreciative audience tilled
the (Jniversity chapel last evening
to listen to Dr. Jordan's lecture on
Agassiz.
The lecturer opened with a few
remarks in regard to the birth and
early life of Agassiz, who was horn
in Switzerland near Neucluitel.
Even during his early boyhood he
showed a great tendency to investi
gate nature, making collections of
insects and other specimens. As a
young man he was without money
but was assisted in his undertak
ings by those who could not stand
by and see so brave a man fail.
For many months Agassiz, in
order to make a careful study of
glacial moraines, lived in a hut
upon the glaciers of the Alps, and
this investigation advanced the
true theory of the movements and
effects of glaciers. After he moved
to Paris he lived in the Latin
quarter, from which he was taken
by the wealthy Humboldt. In
1846, when only thirty-nine years
old, lie was considered the first nat
uralist in France, lie then came
to the United States as a Swiss re
publican, to study in a land rich
in resources. He spent some time
in investigating the glacial effect
in this country, and soon after ac
cepted a professorship at Harvard.
The new country appealed to Agas
siz, and he decided to make it his
home for the greater opportunities
it afforded.
As a teacher, Agassiz brought
the student in close relation with
his subject. He enjoyed having
students around him and took a
particular interest in instructing
school-teachers. Jle was an ardent
advocate of co-education.
Dr. Jordan then dwelt at some
length on the period during which
he as a student was associated with
Agashiz. This included a history
of the summer school founded by
Agassiz on I'enikese island, a per-
Botiitl description of the naturalist,
and many interesting and humor
ous episodes in which he figured.
Agassiz died in 187K and was
buried at Ml. Auburn. A boulder
brought from Switzerland rests up
on his grave.
