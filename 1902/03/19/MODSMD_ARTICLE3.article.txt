# PACIFIC COAST FOOTBALL.
## Caspar Whitney Makes Some Pertinent Observations in March "Outing." 
### 
Caspar Whitney, in the Outing
for March, has this to say in the
course of an article on "Graduate
Coaching on the Pacific Coast:"
"Out of the West come echoes
of the last football season, which,
although late, are yet worthy of
being recorded. Of the Michigan
Stanford game at Pasadena, which
ended the California season on
New Year's day, we have already
heard the result; but according to
recent advices, the game was more
closely contested than the over
whelming score suggests — the final
victory being accounted for as
much because of Michigan's su
perior physical condition as for its
superior football. Twice in the
first half the Californians were able
to try for place-kicks, and twice,
within a foot from their own goal,
they held the Michigan men for
downs. In fact, for the first twen
ty-five minutes of play it was
everybody's game. Michigan was
in superior physical condition, and
went through the two periods with
out losing a man, while Stanford
called out almost every substitute
on the field. Such outcome, how
ever, is surprising to no one ac
quainted with the conditions at
this California university, for, with
abundance of really first-class ma
terial to draw from, the discipline
and the training at Stanford are
poor.
"The Stanford-California game
was interesting this year as a trial
of the graduate coach system, which
now forms a part of their intercol
legiate agreement. So far as the
game itself is concerned, the out
come was encouraging. California
won by better team work than has
been seen on the Pacific Coast since
'U7, and the result was as much of
a surprise to California as to Stan
ford. Both at Berkeley and at
Palo Alto the game had been re
garded as an almost'sure thing' for
Stanford; her men were heavier,
and with few exceptions, individu
ally better. 'The team had shown
to better advantage in the practice
against the athletic clubs. Never
theless, California outplayed her in
every detail of the game —even in
line bucking, where the Stanford
heavy-weights with Slaker, the ex-
Chicago player, at their back, were
supposed to be strongest. 'Twelve
to nothing rather than two to noth
ing—the actual score— would per
haps indicate better the respective
playing merits of the two teams.
"But in the matter of intercol
legiate courtesy and sportsmanlike
feeling, the graduate coach system
appears not to be particularly lielp
ful. In a newspaper interview
after the game, Head-Coach Fiok
ert, of Stanford, gently insinuated
that the California team knew the
Stanford signals; and the retort
courteous was given by Head-Coach
Simpson of California, referring to
the Stanford students at large, in a
jollification after the game, as
'curs' and Mobsters.'
"'The games played by the Cali
fornia universities on their tours
are, excepting the Michigan game,

not worth chronicling. As the
teams make no pretense of keeping
up practice or training after their
'big game' in November, these past
season matches are to be regarded
as incidental to junketing trips,
and should be discouraged as
neither sportsmanlike nor in ac
cordance with the dignity of uni
versity spirit, or the colleges con
cerned."
