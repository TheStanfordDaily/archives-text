# AUSPICIOUS BEGINNING.
## Freshmen Open Track Season by Defeating Santa Clara. Score 42-30. 
### 
Yesterday at Santa Clara, on a
track that a week ago was a stub
ble field, and at present is not
much better than a buffalo wallow,
the Freshmen won from the College
athletes by a score of 42 to 30, the
broad jump, high jump, hammer
throw, and two-twenty being called
off on account of the lateness of the
hour. No records were broken but
several of the performances were
sufficient to make the bleachers
stand np and yell and afterwards
sit down and feel sorry that Santa
Clara had lost.
In the first event, the mile,
Freshman Hawkins surprised the
cynics by taking second place, fin
ishing in gritty style. Castro, from
whom Santa Clara had expected
nothing, as he had done no train
ing, after lagging some thirty yards
behind the leaders caught up in
the last lap and broke the tape ap
parently as strong as ever. He will
be heard from in Coast athletics
again. Tom McCaughern beat
Cutter, the pride of the College, in
an even hundred, covering the mud
holes and mounds in what was ex
cellent time, 10 4-5 seconds. Kehr-
quarter was a surprise. He
ran in tine shape and in very good
time for the track. In the half,
Tarpey took the lead at the start
and kept it to the finish, Castro
coining in second and Sevier third.
Tarpey ran a pretty race and fin
ished well. Woodums and Beach
in the high hurdles, and Dole
in the low, had scarcely any com
petition at all. The finish between
Beach and Hubbard in the low
hurdles for second place was close,
Beach winning. Cutter and Magee
got first and second in the shot-put
easily. Cutler had to go but ten
feet from bis place in the pole
vault. Bell was compelled to leave
on account of the hour, after hav
ing beaten Flemming, Titus, and
Beach out for second place.
Santa Clara lost by injudicious
entries and delays. Had the last
four entries been run off, the score
would probably have been close to
a tie. Magee tried to do too much,
and Cutter should have gone into
the hurdles instead of the hundred.
The Freshmen are fairly well rep
resented in everything except the
mile, though Hawkins will improve
enough to give good men some
hard rubs before the season is ovtr
