In an account of the Freshman*
Santa Clara track meet yesterday,
the San Jose Mercury today says:
"The Santa Clarans vigorously af
firm that the action of Stanford in
leaving the field before the close of
the contest was due more to an
anxiety to avoid defeat than to
catch their train, which was given
out as the reason, the score at this
time standing in Stanford's favor."
As a matter of fact, the events
did not begin until after three
o'clock, because of the procrastina
tion of the college men in measur
ing distances and in completing
preparations. It was understood
all the while that Stanford would
have to catch the 5:40 train, the
last one of the day, for Palo Alto.
Santa Clara tried to run in a high
school athlete. Stanford brought
forward proof of this fact, and the
man was thrown out. The Fresh
men were compelled to leave before
all the events were run through,
and just made their train. Santa
Clara is sore and finds an outlet
for its denunciation in the Mercury.
If the meet had opened early
enough to complete the entire list
of events it would have been more
satisfactory to both sides.
