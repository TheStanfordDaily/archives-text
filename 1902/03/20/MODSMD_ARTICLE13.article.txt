Tiik Calif or nian h;is written an
other editorial, ll is in the familiar
strain which, to interpret, "sincere
ly hopes that Stanford's motives
are not what we, of California, most
firmly helieve they are." Through
some oversight the word "ungentle
manly 1 ' has been omitted this time.
Here is the editorial in all its liter
ary beauty:
Stanford seems to he having all
sorts of trouble about the amend
ments adopted by the intercolleg
iate Athletic Committee, which pro
vided that any athlete coming from
a different "university of standing"

must reside at hie* adopted college
at least one year before he can play
on an intercollegiate athletic team.
The athletic committee accepted the
amendment, but the executive com
mittee refused to do so. There is
just where the trouble lies. Of
course the executive committee has
the special authority in the matter,
but the members of the athletic
committee was composed of men
who imd had a great deal of experi
ence in athletic matters, and were
certainly better qualified than the
members of the executive commit
tee to judge of such matters. The
position of the executive committee
can only lie explained on one of
two grounds: Hither they are quib
bling or they have some reason for
not desiring a rule which would
prevent the possibility of importing
athletes from going into force. We
sincerely hope it is not the latter.
If the former is true, it is certainly
very childish of them.
