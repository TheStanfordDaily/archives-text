# LE 						CONTE MEMORIAL.
## Professor Dudley Explains Sierra Club's Plan for the Lodge in Yosemite. 
### 
1 am able to state somewhat more
explicity than heretofore the needs
of the Sierra Club's committee in
its efforts to raise a sufficient fund
to erect a stone lodge in the Yo
semite Valley to the memory of
that distinguished American, Pro
fessor Joseph Le Conte of Berkeley.
The sum desired is .$501)0. A
large part of this will he raised, in
the opinion of Mr. Colby, the secre
tary of the Sierra Club, without
difficulty. Le Conte had a host of
friends who will contribute. The
subscriptions were intended to be
popular, however, and the fifth
thousand may be difficult to obtain,
if 1 may be allowed, 1 will explain
the situation briefly, and ask any
one who may read this to contri
bute any sum from one to five dol
lars or more, and forward the same
to Win. E. Colby, Mills building,
San Francisco, who acts as treas
urer of the Le Conte Memorial
Committee. The California Moun
taineering Society, the Sierra Club,
including many the first citizens of
the State, has volunteered to secure
the necessary funds, to erect the
building, and subsequently to care
for it.
First of all it is to be a memorial
to Joseph Le Conte â€”to the man
rather than to the scholar. Learned
as lie was, one always felt in his
presence how much greater, loftier,
and more enduring than any scien
tific accomplishment is the charac
ter of a great man, unstained by
anything petty or selfish, always
seeking to make his fellow beings
happier, whether by personal kind
ness or acts of public spirit. There
is no man in America whose schol
arly work cannot he carried on as
well by some one else. Hut there is
no one to replace Le Conte's per
sonality, now that he is gone.
In the second place the proposed
lodge is no mere monument. It is
to be a granite building of good de
sign, with at least one spacious
room furnished with the maps,
photographs, and literature illus
trating the mountains which the
Sierra Club will place there. These
a re for free consultation by every
visitor to the Yosemite,drawn there
by the desire to climb and explore,
or to study the rocks and the life
of the mountains, and will he under
the care of a competent custodian.
Le Conte dearly loved these
mountains, lie was thirty years]
a student of the Yosemite, and a
frequent visitor. Last summer,
rich in years and in honors, he
died in that great valley. This, so j
fitting a place for the last hours of
a mini like Le Conte, i< scarcely
less fitting for a building of the
kind proposed, useful to the thou-;
sands of visitors who throng the
Yosemite every season; and useful
in a way Le Conte himself delighted

to lie of use. Let us sill honor our
selves by contributing a little to its
erection. In this appeal T am
joined by Professor Stillinnn, longer
a friend of the great man than any
other person at Stanford.

Member of the Le Conte
Memoria 1 Committee.
