# OLD-TIMERS VICTORIOUS.
## Alumni Defeat Varsity in a Slow, Uninteresting Game by Score of Eight to Six. 
### 
The Alumni team defeated the
Varsity yesterday afternoon in a
slow and uninteresting contest by
the score of 8 to 6. The home team
seemed to be the winner up to the
seventh inning, but here the Car
dinal went up in the air and the
graduates accumulated just enough
runs to give them the game by a
safe margin.
Parker did the pitching for the
Varsity. He failed to show up in
his usual form. He walked four
men, and was rather careless in
his tnrowing to bases. His sup
port was fairly good, the total of
eight errors being misleading in its
indications. The fielding was
good, and the hitting greatly im
proved.
The first inning was closed with
out a score on either side, the Var
sity having retired the Alumni in
one, two, three order. Knight
started the second inning by saw
ing at three and getting to second
on a bad throw to the initial by
Bettingan. McKennon singled to
right field, Knight going to third
and coining home on a bad throw
by Ballagh to third. The Alumni
scored three runs this inning, two
of which were brought in by Bet
tingan's hot three-bagger along
third base. The runs were scat
tered through the remainder o1 the
game with the exception of the last
half of the seventh inning, when
the Varsity went off its feet long
enough to allow the graduates to
score four runs.
