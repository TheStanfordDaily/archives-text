# NEVADA CONCERT.
## The 						Great Prima Donna Realized Expectations Last Evening. Audience. 
### 
Between live and six hundred
people listened to the concert in the
Assembly Hall hist evening. The
enthusiasm of the audience was un
restrained.
Madame Nevada fuily realized
the expectations which her fame
had aroused. Throughout the long
program she charmed the audience
with the exquisite beauty of her
voice and with her facility in the
art of colorature singing. Though
her voice in places shows slight
signs of wear, Madame Nevada has
absolute mastery of tone-gradations
and gives pianissimos nothing
short of perfect.
Besides the difficult program an
nounced, Madame Nevada gra
ciously sang again and again in
response to the enthusiasm of the
audience, giving "Old Kentucky
Home," "Annie Laurie," and "Lis
ten to the Mocking-Bird," songs
for which she has won world-wide
renown.
The pianist, M. Leon Moreau,
plays with the greatest delicacy.
Although his mastery of tone had
no chance to reveal itself through
the instrument he had to play on,
the velvet finish of his touch was
always delightful. M. Moreau
played two of his own composi
tions, "Esquisse," and a symphonic
poem written for orchestra and two
pianos His compositions, like his
playing, are graceful and poetic,
and full of appreciation of har
monic values. â€¢
