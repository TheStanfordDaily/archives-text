# FIRST CAMPUS MEET.
## Sophomores Meet Ukiah High School on the Oval Tomorrow. Good Events Expected. 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock
on the oval, the Sophomores will
meet the athletes of the Ukiah high
school. This is the first field-day
on the campus this season and will
undoubtedly be largely attended.
The track is in fine condition, and
records may be broken. The spec
tators will witness a large number
of closely contested events and con
siderable enthusiasm.
The Ukiith hundred-yard man
has done the event in 10 1-5, ex
actly the time in which Hamilton
has been going this semester. Ha
gans, the sprinter, also has done
phenomenal work in the two
twenty, 22 3-5 seconds; but unless
he repeats his performance he may
be induced to cross tfie tape behind
a Stanford man. The Sophomores
have in Dunn and Crossman two
excellent quarter-milers, either of
whom can come close around
54 seconds without competition.
Wyckoff, the high school man, has
done 54 2-5, and is expected to do
better tomorrow. In the half-mile
both Byrnes and Henley, brother
of the high-jumper, have records of
2:10. Holman or Swinerton,either
one, will make them do better
than 2:10 if Ukiah wins the event.
G. Weller ought to win out in the
mile, though no one can tell what
Burton will do, as this will be his
first race. The hurdle races will
probably be exciting, with no par
ticular advantage in either Tay
lor's or J. VVeller's favor.
Henley has been putting in the
season trying to get back into his
old form, and tomorrow's contest
with men with whom he has
worked in high school will show
to a large degree what may be ex
pected of him in the Intercolleg
iate. However, he will have a
hard time taking first place in any
of his events, the pole-vault, the
high jump, or broad jump, Sea
well and Cox having gone 10:05
with the pole, Seawell and Thomas
5:08 in the high, and J. Weller
21:10 in the broad. Briggs has
put the 12-pound shot 45 feet,
while Hyde should go beyond that
mark.
