Every baseball game on the
campus this season, with the ex
ception of the one last Saturday,
has been a financial loss to the
student body. Had weather hat
been partially responsible for small
attendance, but not altogether. The
interest shown by the student body
is lamentably weak. Many of the
contests held here might be sched
uled away from home, when tin
expenses would he borne by the op
posing team. Although this would
avoid the danger of a drain on the
treasury, the purpose of holding the
games here is to give the students a
chance to see them. Nearly every
one can spare an hour or two a
week and the price of admission.
The season is now well on and the
weather is propitious. Attend the
g:i mes.
