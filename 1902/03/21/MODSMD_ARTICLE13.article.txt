Wiikn the Mormon choir finished
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," last evening
every student felt the force of Pro
fessor Stephens' statement that
Stanford Ints the best college song
he knows. How many could have
joined the choir in the hynm if
the audience had been asked to fol
low? Out of the two thousand peo
ple in the Assembly Hall the num
ber would have been exceedingly

small. We seldom hear this su
perb hymn, written by Professor A.
\V. Smith, and set to music by Mrs.
Smith, both of our own faculty. As
given last night it was most stirring.
We have been made to realize as
never before the beauty of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," by these singers
from a distance, and the visit of the
Mormon choir will be long remem
bered at the University.
