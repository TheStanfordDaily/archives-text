# "HAIL, STANFORD, HAIL."
## Mormon Choir Surprised Audience and Aroused Tremendous Demonstration. 
### 
Not since the McKinley memo
rial services in September has the
Assembly Hall held such a crowd
as it did last evening to hear the!
Mormon choir. Hundreds of peo- j
pie were compelled to stand. I'he
first number on the program had i
been left blank, and when, without
any announcement, the hundred
and lifty voices began singing Pro
fessor and Mrs Smith's hymn,"Hail, I
Stanford, Hail," the effect was dra-j
matic. At the close of the lirst
stanza the big audience, from the
rooters in the top of the gallery to
the members of the faculty in the
forward seats on the main floor,
gave such an outburst of applause
and cheers that it was some time
before the singers could resume.
The choir sang the beautiful words
and music as they have never been
heartl here before, and the audience
was stirred with pleasure, enthusi
asm, and pride in its alma mater.
Another pause was necessary at the
end of the second stanza, for the
enthusiasm had grown, and when
the music ceased it was followed by
a tremendous demonstration. Pro
fessor Evan Stephens, the leader,
had carried out his surprise per
fectly. After the applause dieil
away he said simply: "1 want to
congratulate you on having the
best college song I know of." Again,
at the close of the program, the
hymn was given.
By half-past seven the middle
section of the gallery had been oc
cupied bv a solid crowd of rooters,
who, under the leadership of Cap
tain Integer of the football team,
indulged in a running "jolly-up."
They sang, gave the Varsity and
other yells, and furnished prelim
inary entertainment to the crowd.
When Mrs. Stanford arrived and
walked down the aisle of the main
floor with her secretary she received
an ovation. The choir was greeted
with a big cheer as it filed out on
the stage, and was given repeated
assurance that it was all right be
fore the program opened. A mutual
spirit of good feeling seemed to pre
vail from the first, for the singers
on the stage applauded an incipient
attempt of the rooters to whistle
two or three popular airs, and also
acknowledged the greetings.
Following the first number, the
program was carried out essentially
as published in the Daily Palo!
Alto Wednesday evening. Every I
selection of the chorus was given
with wonderful effect. Little'' lot"
Williams, eight years old, who sang
"The Holy City" in a marvelouslyj
pure and sweet voice that could be â– 
heard everywhere in llie big hall,
called forth the most persistent up-'
plause. With curly hair and short,
white dress the child made a beau
tiful appearance on the platform. |
Her enunciation was remarkably
clear. In acknowledgment of the
applause she came forward and
bowed. The "Soldier's Chorus,"from
Faust, and " Hallelujah," from the
Messiah, were especially popular.
Professor Stephen's "Winter and
Spring," and the old English glee,
"Sleep, While the Soft Evening
Breezes," were beautifully given.
The solos were well received, and
Mrs. Edwards responded to an en
core with "Comin' Through the
Rye." The choir sang the Mormon
hymn, "Praise the Lord, All Ye
Nations," with impressive fervor.
Professor Stephensexplained that
one reason they were so glad to sing
at Stanford was because of the
number of Utah students here.
After the chorus gave the State
hymn, "Utah, We Love Thee," the
audience was asked to rise and join
in "America," which was followed
by the "Star Spangled Banner."
The choir then sang a farewell se
lection and closed with "Hail,
Stanford, Hail."
At about three o'clock yesterday
afternoon the two excursion trains,
bearing over 500 people, reached
Palo Alto. The visitors came out
to the campus and drove or walked
around the buildings, taking in the
points of interest. They were
served with dinner at the Inn,
where the regular boarders had
been fed between five and six. It
was nearly eight before the entire
crowd was disposed of. Caterer
Strowbridge and the waiters suc
ceeded in handling the unusual
number admirably. After the con
cert in the evening the excursion
ists returned to their trains and
left at eleven o'clock for Del Monte.
There they will give a concert, re
turning to San Jose, thence to Sac
ramento, and arriving home at
Salt Lake City next Monday. They
had been away just one week yes
terday.
Only one hundred and fifty of
the people on the trip are members
of the choir. The excursion is con
ducted by Professor Stephens to
give the choir an outing, and the
expense is covered by the sale of
tickets to outsiders. The organiza
tion has made several such trips,
taking second prize at the World's
Fair, Chicago, in the choral compe
tition, and singing at the Midwinter
Fair in San Francisco.
