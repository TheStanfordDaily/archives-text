# "HAIL, STANFORD, HAIL."
## Mormon Choir Surprised Audience and Aroused Tremendous Demonstration. 
### 
Not since the McKinley memo
rial services in September has the
Assembly Hall held such a crowd
as it did last evening to hear the!
Mormon choir. Hundreds of peo- j
pie were compelled to stand. I'he
first number on the program had i
been left blank, and when, without
any announcement, the hundred
and lifty voices began singing Pro
fessor and Mrs Smith's hymn,"Hail, I
Stanford, Hail," the effect was dra-j
matic. At the close of the lirst
stanza the big audience, from the
rooters in the top of the gallery to
the members of the faculty in the
forward seats on the main floor,
gave such an outburst of applause
and cheers that it was some time
before the singers could resume.
The choir sang the beautiful words
and music as they have never been
heartl here before, and the audience
was stirred with pleasure, enthusi
asm, and pride in its alma mater.
Another pause was necessary at the
end of the second stanza, for the
enthusiasm had grown, and when
the music ceased it was followed by
a tremendous demonstration. Pro
fessor Evan Stephens, the leader,
had carried out his surprise per
fectly. After the applause dieil
away he said simply: "1 want to
congratulate you on having the
best college song I know of." Again,
at the close of the program, the
hymn was given.
By half-past seven the middle
section of the gallery had been oc
cupied bv a solid crowd of rooters,
who, under the leadership of Cap
tain Integer of the football team,
indulged in a running "jolly-up."
They sang, gave the Varsity and
other yells, and furnished prelim
inary entertainment to the crowd.
When Mrs. Stanford arrived and
walked down the aisle of the main
floor with her secretary she received
an ovation. The choir was greeted
with a big cheer as it filed out on
the stage, and was given repeated
assurance that it was all right be
fore the program opened. A mutual
spirit of good feeling seemed to pre
vail from the first, for the singers
on the stage applauded an incipient
attempt of the rooters to whistle
two or three popular airs, and also
acknowledged the greetings.
Following the first number, the
program was carried out essentially
as published in the Daily Palo!
Alto Wednesday evening. Every I
selection of the chorus was given
with wonderful effect. Little'' lot"
Williams, eight years old, who sang
"The Holy City" in a marvelouslyj
pure and sweet voice that could be â– 
heard everywhere in llie big hall,
called forth the most persistent up-'
plause. With curly hair and short,
white dress the child made a beau
tiful appearance on the platform. |
