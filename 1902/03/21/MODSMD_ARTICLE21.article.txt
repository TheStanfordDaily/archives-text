# Sheet-Music for the Farce.
## 
### 
In addition to tlie usual josh
poster and the "broken-arch"
poster, the Junior class will pub
lish another novelty in the shape
of sheet-music. This will he an
overture or melody of the chief airs
to be played at the performance.
It is Ciilled the "Ptopu Two-step,"
and has a refrain in waltz time.
The music will be printed in uni
form style with Flint's ''Cardinal
Forever." The cover will be in
blue, a reduced facsimile of John
son's broken-arch. Yanke's band
will play this as the seventh dance
at the Junior Prom, and Copp's
orchestra will give it nt the per
formance of the Farce. Original
music is sometimes published in
connection with class plays at Har
vard and other eastern colleges, but
the class of 1903 is the first to make
the attempt here. Its success will
depend on the local sale.
