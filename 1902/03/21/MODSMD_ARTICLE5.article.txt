# Jerseys for the Sophs.
## 
### 
At the Sophomore class meeting
held in the chapel this afternoon
the report of the committee ap
pointed to look up the matter of
buying jerseys for men who make
the class teams was accepted. The
jersey selected is to be cardinal in
color, with a six-inch black stripe
running across the center, upon
which will be the class numerals in
white blocked letters. A commit
tee composed of the captains of the
football, baseball, and track teams
is to award the jerseys; but, in gen
eral, every man who made the base
ball team this year, all who are on
the class football team next year,
and those who make a point for the
class in the class field-day on
March 23th, are to be given sweat
ers. A cap was also adopted,
which is to be red, with a small
black visor. The class, however,
will not furnish these, but those
who wish them can purchase one.
