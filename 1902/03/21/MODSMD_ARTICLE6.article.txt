# AN EASY VICTORY.
## Varsity Defeats San Jose Normal School by the Decisive Score of Nine to One. 
### 
The San Jose Normal School
went down to easy defeat before
the Varsity yesterday at San Jose,
by the score of 9to 1. The Stan
ford team put up a surprisingly
good exhibition of ball, while Mc-
Farland pitched a game tha 1 bor
dered on brilliancy. He was cool
and steady, and through (he entire
game proved a puzzle to the Nor
mal men. The best they could do
off his delivery was to get three
singles. His support was excel lent,
and the Varsity showed itself to be
continually improving. The field
ing was very good, especially that
of Cowden and Crawford.
The San Jose team was prevented
from scoring until the seventh in
ning, while the Cardinal succeeded
in crossing the home plate every
inning except one. The School
nine played in ragged form. Em
erson occupied Martin's usual place
in the box and proved a poor sub
stitute. He was wild and erratic,
and was repeatedly found by Stan
ford for good, safe hits.
Freshman McKennon was tried
on the initial bag, and although
he showed signs of nervousness, he
held the sack down in a good man
ner. Brown was still unable to
take his place on third, on account
of injuries, and Copp did the hon
ors there.
The contest was shortened
to enable the Stanford team to
get the evening train home.
