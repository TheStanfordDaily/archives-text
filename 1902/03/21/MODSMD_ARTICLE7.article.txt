## Story About Which the Junior Farce, to be Given Next Week, is Woven. Seat Sale Monday. 
### 
The play which the Juniors are
to present on next Thursday night
in the Assembly Hall can hardly
be called a college play, and yet it
purports to deal with Stanford
life. The action takes place chiefly
about the quadrangle, but the time
is located one thousand years in
the future, when, as may be sup
posed, many changes have come
about.
In the first place, it seems that
vast geologic upheavals about the
year 20U0 served to destroy nearly
every continent now familiar, and
to throw up volcanic islands over
the surface of the ocean, which are
slowly repeopled by the surviving
humans. Tradition and history of
the past are lost, literature is for
gotten, while science makes tremen
dous strides, due to the fact that
Stanford's scientific libraries alone
were saved from destruction. Re
gard for the past has given way to
a ridiculous world-tyranny under
Pkwtnopfu, Prince of Tahiti, and
president of the Junior class.
Human sympathy is decadent, and
love is an unknown influence.
Marriages are regulated from the
registrar's office, by a final exam,
at the middle of the Junior year.
Every man is engaged to the girl
obtaining the mark nearest his.
Pktopu is first scholar in Leozom
ics, and Limona, the keenest co-ed,
is his fiancee. The interest of the
play centers absolutely in"the
corpse Marlino." This is the body
of Alfred Martin, Stanford 1903,
who has fallen asleep in a class of
the present day, and who is pre
served for ten centuries with the
greatest care, in accordance with
the prophecy made by the San
Francisco Examiner that the mil
lenium would result when he
awoke. The third act disproves
this prophecy.
Tickets will be on sale next Mon
day on the quadrangle and at the
University Drugstore. A full cast
will be published in Monday's
Palo Alto.
