# SOPHOMORES 61, UKIAH 47
## Satisfactory Meet Saturday.—Hamilton Broke Stanford Record in Two-Twenty. 
### 
The field-day Saturday between
the Sophomores and the Ukiah high
school, which resulted in a score of
61 to 47 in favor of Stanford, was
a most satisfactory meet in many
respects. Only one man, Hamil
ton in the hundred, failed to make
the time expected of him. Al
together, the results of the season's
training were quite evident. Ham
ilton in the two-twenty, Dunn and
Watson in the quarter, Henley in
the jumps,and Hyde in the weights,
showed a marked improvemant
over performances of last year.
The mile run was lost by Burton
on account of insufficient head
work. He should have made the
pace hotter and kept to the pole
instead of taking the outside at the
turns. He has good stuff in him
for a twi)-,mile man. In the half,
Holnian won out easily, though the
time made was slow.
The hundred was a surprise, as
Hamilton was heaten out by Ha
gans, the Ukiah sprinter, in time
much poorer than Hamilton had
done in practice without competi
tion. The Stanford man, however,
made up for this in the two-twenty,
lowering theUniversity record a fifth
of a second. He started out well, i
took the turn in fine shape, and
finished strong; it was the prettiest j
run of lite day.
The four-forty was not as fast as|
had been expected, owing to a lack i
of competition. Dunn won out;
easily. The finish of Watson was j
one of the features of the meet.
He came down the track after
Crossmau with a fine finishing
sprint and crossed the tape but a
few inches behind, having gained
several yards in the last fifty.
Grossman is steadily improving.
Henley's jumping was up to any
standard he has as yet set at the
University, clearing the bar easily
in the high jump at about the same
height at which he was beaten out!
in the Intercollegiate last year. He!
was not pressed in either the pole
vault or broad jump.
"Jack" Taylor's work in the hur
dles, like Hamilton's, was much
better in the two-twenty than in
the shorter event. It was the first
time this year that Taylor went the
whole distance in the low hurdles,;
for Moulton has kept him working;
on the turn. His time, '20 2-5, was
good. He cleared the hurdles with
little loss of speed and in excellent
form.
The Ukiah men were as good a
bunch of athletes as any high school
in the Stateof equal size with Ukiah,
one hundred and twenty students,
has ever put out. Hagans, the two
Wellers, Briggs in the weights, and
Seawell in the jumps, showed the
results of consistent training and a.
great deal of native ability. Some
of their athletes lack a little in form.
The take-off in the pole-vault
bothered the Ukiah men and ac-j
counts for their failure to go to aj
greater height. Both Seawell and!
Cox have repeatedly done 10:06 on
their own grounds.
