Last Friday evening the Gym
nasium Club presented the most
creditable performance it has yet
given. The class-work was good,
llie individual features were new
and interesting. The work on the
parallel bars was especially note
worthy, being intricate and well
executed. The tumbling of Long
and Sill was perhaps the best per
formance during the exhibition.
The fencing of the Kehrlein broth
ers and the wrestling of Davis and
Burton were up to the standard set
by these men in former exhibitions.
Atkinson's fancy club-swinging
with (ire in the dark was a pleas
ing surprise. "Dad" Moulton ex
hibited his dogs for the first time
before a general audience. The
pyramid work was new and well
done, and the members in their
uniforms made a good showing.
The one accident of the evening
happened to Beach, who broke his
thumb in his first stunt on the hor
izontal bar. This prevented him
from taking part in the later work,
except a few efforts on the mat.
