# "Evil and Free Will"
## 
### 
I)r. Elliott preached yesterday
morning on the subject "Evil and
Free Will." He said that good
and evil had been the problems be
fore man ever since the world be
gan. Asceticism tried to solve it
by saying that the world is evil, to
avoid which one must set himself
apart to fast and pray. Puritan
ism said there is a great deal of evil
in the world, but some good. The
good must be severely adhered to,
and the very appearance of evil
shunned.
The student who avoids politics
because of wire pulling, and ath
letics because of gambling, counts
as a mere cipher in college life.
When a man leaves home he meets
in the college world many tempta
tionsâ€”his creed may change and
old beliefs fall away, but he must
not lose his conception of moral
values. He will enter the struggle
with joy. it is not the evil he
meets that will make him strong
but the evil that he overcomes.
