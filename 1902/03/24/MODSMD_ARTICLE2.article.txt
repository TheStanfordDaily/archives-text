'The Encina stag given Saturday
evening was an enjoyable affair in
ils informality and in the spirit of
good-fellowship shown by the stu

F. E. Nangle, '08, and L. 11. Rose
berry, '03, sang several selections,
and Joe de Forest told a number
of humorous stories. The orchestra
gave another selection, and then
L. E. Harter, '01, W. W. Copp, '03,
and G. B. Sill, '03, did some clever
tumbling. After a wrestling match
between Dehy, '03, and L. K. Wise
hart, '03, there were several hotly
contested boxing bouts between
O. S. Lousley, '05, and M. 11. Far
rar, '04; W. I. Traeger, '03.and 11.
