# A 						BIG SCORE.
## Varsity Made Eighteen Tallies Against the Olympic Club Saturday. 
### 
The Olympic Club, with its gal
'axy of old stars, furnished an easy
victory for the Cardinal Saturday,
to the extent of 18 to 7. The con
test was a walkaway for the home
team from the start, when Brown,
the first man up, was hit. Copp
ran for him and took second on a
pretty bunt by Crawford. Copp
and Crawford came home on a bunt
by Cowden, and the subsequent
wild throw of Lichtenberg to first.
Captain Cowden crossed the same
plate on a three-base hit by McGil
vray, the latter coming in on a bad
throw of Zane to third. When a
total of five runs had been piled up
Blake stopped the agony by a pop
fly to short-stop.
The Varsity put up a good game.
There was some fine fielding done,
especially by Cowden, who made
phenomenal stops and catches.
The hitting was terrific. Nearly
every man got a bit, Cowden
showing up brilliantly in the bat
tery list with four hits to his credit,
two of which were clean three-bag
gers. Lichtenberg was easily found
by everybody, and bis pitching
rather than his support accounts
for the large score. Gammon's
men played a good
iihu errors were made, but the Var
sity's showing in the error column
is equally as bad as the defeated
team's. Several inexcusable errors
were made by the same team, but
with a few exceptions the Cardinal
gave a. first-class exhibition of ball.
