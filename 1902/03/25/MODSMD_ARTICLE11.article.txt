Editor Daily I'alo Alto:
The outlook for a fair track team
seems good, but it could l>e im
proved I))' h little more college
loyalty. We are crippled in ihe
distances. The scarcity of distance
men is surprising. The loss of
Sprague can only be replaced by
one other man, who has not yet
come out to help his mates of last
year out of a positive defeat in the
distances. The wet weather lias
set us back so that it is impossible
for any coach living to develop an
other one-miler or two-miler at
this late date unless the applicant
has natural abilities. Such a one
is among us, and 1 regret that he
does not see it as a duty to come
out and help us all. College spirit
alone should prompt this. Those
who are out, are working hard and
training properly and are a credit
to the athletic department. It is
true that they may not all he
champions nor all win points, hut
the genuine, earnest, loyal spirit is
manifest in them. 1 am sure
that the men should receive the
same degree of credit from their
fellow-students and from the train
er and captain, even though they
fall by the wayside in athletic abil
ity, so long as they have trained
faithfully and stood on manly
principles. 1, for one, thank them
heartily for their support, and
would ask them to train on to the
end of the season, as no one can
tell what improvement may come
in the next four weeks. For those
who do not win t his season, per
haps their turn will come next
year. Once more I will thank the
boys one and all for their confi
dence and willing work.
