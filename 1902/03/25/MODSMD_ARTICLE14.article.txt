The announcement is made that
the Inn has been able to reduce the
price of board from four dollars to
three dollars and seventy-five cents
a week. If this can be done now
without loss after the Club has
been in existence only three
months, it is reasonable to expect
that, with a substantial increase in
patronage next fall, the price may
be again reduced or the service
made more elaborate. The co
operative plan is fulfilling the
claims of its most enthusiastic ad
vocates.
