Some years have elapsed since
negotiations failed for an intercol
legiate basket-ball game between
the co-eds of the University of Cal
ifornia and of Stanford because the
California girls refused to play out
doors and the Stanford girls sai 1
they could not play indoors. Now
a challenge has come for a tennis
contest next May. Probably there
is no danger of such a hitch as oc
cured in the former negotiations,
but the season is rather late to
schedule such a match this year.
Problems entering into the arrange
ments of this kind would be sim
plified if women's athletics were in
charge of an association with full
power to schedule intercollegiate
events. Should the women enter
into outside contests, it will be
come necessary to revise the present
plan of athletic control.
