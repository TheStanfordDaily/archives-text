# Interesting Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
A full squad of baseball candi
dates was out for practice last
night. The usual preliminary
work was carried on before the
line-up between the first and sec
ond teams. Every man on the
field shows improvement. This is
especially noticeable in Crawford,
Blake, and Copp. At shortstop
Crawford plays bis position in such
a way as to command commenda
tion of the bleachers, lilake is be
coming safer at first, and is band
ling ground bits in a most satis
factory manner. The batting of
both Copp and Blake can stand
considerable improvement.
The race for the delivery end of
the battery is becoming faster and
more interesting every day. At
the beginning of the season Barker
seemed to have the inside track.
He has done good work ever since,
but he has been hard pushed by
McFarland, whose improvement is
remarkable. He handles himself
admirably, watches the bases well,
and is a safe hitter. While Tritch
has been pitching steadily, he has
fallen down some since the begin
ning of the season. The race be
tween the three is exceedingly in
teresting, and is being closely
watched.
The men on the second team
played a strong game last night.
The work of Trowbridge, '05, at
third, was especially good. He is
fast and sure in handling ground
hits, and has a strong, careful arm
in throwing bases. McKennon
did creditable work at short, while
Stillman held down first. The
batting order of the two teams last
night was as follows:
