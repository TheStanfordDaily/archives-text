# California Co-eds Challenge Stanford.
## 
### 
The University of California co
eds have challenged the girls of
Stanford to a tennis tournament.
A request was made this afternoon
for the Athletic Committee to make
this an intercollegiate event. Ow
ing to the lateness of the semester
the committee laid the proposal
aside until next year.
