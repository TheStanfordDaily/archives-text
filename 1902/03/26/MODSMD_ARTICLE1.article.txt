# BATTING AND FIELDING.
## Averages Made by the Baseball Men in Games Played This Season. 
### 
The batting and fielding aver
ages of all the men who have
played in any Varsity baseball
game this season are given below.
The number of games played so far
corresponds exactly to that at the
corresponding time of last year.
The batting averages in general are
much better this year. The record
last year was tied by Edwards and
Cowden with an average of .354.
This year McGilvray is the suc
cessful man, with an average of
.418. The clean records in fielding
are held by men who have been in
comparatively few games. Taking
into consideration the number of
chances he has had, McGilvray
will also head this list with an av
erage of .934.
There are two more scheduled
games before the first intercollegi
ate on April sth, but as tomorrow
is the last issue of the Daily
Palo Alto before the spring vaca
tion, the list is published at this
time in order to show just what
the different candidates have done.
No doubt many of the men defi
cient now will bring up their aver
ages considerably during the next
two matches. A final list of aver
ages will be published after the in
tercollegiate series.
The abbreviations G., A. 8., H.,
1\ ()., A , E., and I'., signify games
played, times at bat, hits, put-outs,
assists, errors, and percentage.
