# REQUIREMENTS CHANGED.
## Hereafter Anglo-Saxon Will Not be Necessary for Degree in English. 
### 
Hereafter the English depart
meut will not require Anglo-Snxon
for the degree of A. B. Only one
language out of the nix, —German,
French, Italian, Spanish, Latin,
and Greek —will lie necessary for
gntduation. The knowledge of this
one language must, however, he
more thorough than was formerly
required of the three. Great stress
is to be laid upon vocal training,
and the ability to write printable
English will be made requisite to
the bachelor's degree. For those
who wish to receive the teacher's
certificate from the department
and to be recommended as teachers,
additional requirements are to be
made, including Anglo-Saxon and
the ability to interpret literature
orally.
The revised requirements will be
set forth in full in the next issue of
the Register, and will go into effect
for new and old students alike at
the beginning of next year.
