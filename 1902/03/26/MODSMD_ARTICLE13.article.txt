# Girls Will Not Play Tennis
## 
### 
The proposed tennis game be
tween the California girls and the
Stanford girl* liiih been given up
for this year. All matches between
California and Stanford have to he
authorized by the Athletic; Commit
tee of the two universities. These
committees hold ordinarily two
meetings a year, the last of which for
this year, was held early this se
mester. Although a special meeting
could he called for the considera
tion of this matter, it could not lie
done before the faster recess. Cal
ifornia closes two weeks before
Stanford, which leaves too short a
time in which lo make all the ar
rangements necessary for such an
intercollegiate event.
