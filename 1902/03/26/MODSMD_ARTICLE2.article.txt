At the meeting yesterday of the
Athletic Committee a motion was
made to reject the one-year resi

deuce provision in the Intercollegi- j
ate Agreement. A warm.discussion j
followed, which resulted in the car
rying of a motion to lay the ques-1
tion on the table until Thursday I
afternoon, when all the committee j
will he present. The objections j
urged against the amendment were j
that it was general and indefinite, j
A Stanford man might attend an
other institution for one semester,
and on returning he barred from |
athletics here. As it is now, the;
amendment excludes men from
other colleges who have not taken
part in athletics there. While the
purpose of the amendment is to
bar athletes from other colleges, it
was claimed that it more than does
this. Another difficulty was sug
gested in determining the universi
ties of recognized standing.
The arguments reflecting the
above were about the same as
have before been published: It
would aid the purification of ath
letics, and would help to develop
Stanford athletic material; if the
students do not take any action in
the matter the faculty probably
will, and their action would place
us at a disadvantage with the Uni
versity of California.
