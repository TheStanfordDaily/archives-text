The decision of the track cap
tains to bar from participation in
the field-day all athletes who have
not been in regular training, will
meet with uni ver,sal approval. The
interclase meet is intended as a
stepping-stone to the more impor
tant contest with California later
on. It serves both as an admir
able opportunity for prospective

Varsity men to become used to
strenuous competition, and as a
standard whereby the coach may
gauge the capabilities and progress
of his pupils. In such a meet
there should he no place for the
man who goes into the event simply
for a day's diversion. If he is cap
able of winning points, he should
have gone into training with the
rest of the squad at the beginning
of the season; if he is not, his pres
ence is superfluous in a competi
tion where the gaming of a single
point may mean a class champion
ship. The ruling is made in the
interests of those who have been
working faithfully for months, and
if it is prejudicial to the interests
of any one, it is the student who has
been withholding from the Univer
sity what is its rightful due.
