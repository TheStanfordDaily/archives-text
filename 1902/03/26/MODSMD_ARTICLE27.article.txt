# Teaching in the Philippines.

### 
Prof. M. li. Anderson lias received
an interesting letter from 11. C.
Theobald, '00, who is teaching in
the Philippines. He went across
last AiigUHton the Sheridan, which
carried about forty teachers, among
them being R. H. Wardall, '98,
0. J. Pierson, 97, and L. C. Walker,
'00. The letter was written at his
post, Maragondon, Cavite Province,
Luzon. Among other things, Theo
bald says:
"Most of the first assignments
seem to be made without any
knowledge of the personal charac
teristics of the appointees, and in
many instances the superinten
dents appear to have little accurate
information as to the conditions
and needs of the places to which
they are sending teachers. The
teacher is the explorer, and his
monthly report often furnishes the
first correct data. This, however,
is almost a physical necessity,
owing to the present difficulties of
travel and consequent vast con
sumption of time in any extended
journey.
"There are upwards of GOO peo
ple in this pueblo where I am, and
its Varrios, and 1 have a colleague,
Mr. Kenagy, from Nebraska. On
account of a protested election the
municipal machinery is out of gear
and we have had little opportunity
to secure native assistants or even
a suitable building. One of us
teaches part of the day at the
girls' school, which is held at the
home of a native Filipino, and in
addition we have sixty.-three boys
enrolled at the abandoned Tribunal
Building. The present small at
tendance is due to the fact that
many children are employed in
planting rice, which work is nearly
over. We have each an evening
class three times a week, and the in
terest shown is encouraging.
"The plan of the department is
to have native principals and as
sistants provided b}' the munici
palities, the English teacher to be
an adjunct, teaching his teachers
at stated sessions until they are
able to carry on instruction in
English This is working with
splendid results in the older
schools, and besides English the
Filipino teachers are given instruc
tion in school management, meth
ods of teaching, etc."
