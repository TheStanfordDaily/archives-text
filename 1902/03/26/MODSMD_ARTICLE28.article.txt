A. L. Walker,'ol, who went to
the Philippine*) last fall to join the
teaching force, writes the Daily
Palo Alto from Canton, China, as
fol lows:
"1 am spending the rice season
in the Islands, visiting in China.
1 came up from Hong Kong a week
ago, and expect to take the boat to
morrow for Macao. It seems
strange to be directed everywhere
by a Chinaman. One has taken
me all over the city. Missionaries
and consuls are the only foreigners
here; and as this seems to be a
busy time for them, I get little of
their guidance. The streets are so
winding and narrow that a fellow
can get lost in them anywhere.
The water life is one of the most
interesting features of Canton to
me. It is estimated that '200,000
beings live on the Pearl river. I
never tire watching the kaleido
scopic changes constantly occuring
among them —their highly decora
ted boats gliding here and there;
it's a sight worth seeing."
