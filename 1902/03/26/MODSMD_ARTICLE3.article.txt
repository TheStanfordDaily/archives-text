# Interclass Field-Day.
## 
### 
The arrangements preliminary
to the Interclass field-day have
about been completed. This will
he about the best meet of the season
with the single exception of the In
tercollegiate, and in many respects
will be as good a lield-day from the
standpoint of the bleachers as will
be the Intercollegiate. Not a fifth
of a second separates the men in tlie
hundred's trials, nor two-fifths in
the two twenty. The quarter has
at least three men all who
go under fifty-three seconds. The
half and the mile and the two-mile
have been run by several of the men
in time very close and fast. The
hurdles, with Taylor, Knhn, and
Naramore entered, will be exciting
raees.
The captains of the four I earns
have been selecting their men. They
have signed the following agree
ment:
"We, the undersigned captains
of the class track teams, hereby
agree not to enter any man in the
Interclass field-day who has not
been observing training rules. The
question as to who has been observ
ing training rules shall be finally
decided by Trainer Moulton.
