# The 						Name Topju.

A number of clever answers have
been received, attempting to solve
the riddle of the name of the Tahiti
Prince. Although plausible, no
one of these answers is the correct
one, nor even approximately right.
Ordinary passes for standing room
have been sent to each one who
competed. The Junior committee
regrets very much that the correct
answer was not presented.
