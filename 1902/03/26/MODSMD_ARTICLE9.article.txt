# Strong Man's Contest.
## 
### 
After having been talked of for
a long time and t hen almost for
gotten, the strong man's contest is
to be taken up again at Michigan.
The Daily Newn says:
"At the Eastern colleges a strong
man's contest is a periodical occur
rence and affords the athletes a
chance to find out how strong they
really are. No such system has
ever been putin actual practice
here, and therefore the inaugura
tion of this innovation will he
hailed with delight by the incipi
ent Sandows.
''The system, as it will be used
here, is practically the same as that
originated by Dr. Sargent of Har
vard. By this system the strength
of all the larger muscles is deter
mined, and by a certain scale
of measurements the aggregate
strength of all the muscles is com
puted."
