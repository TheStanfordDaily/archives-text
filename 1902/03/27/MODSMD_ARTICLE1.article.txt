The Varsity played Belmont
School at Belmont this afternoon,
and tomorrow they will meet the
San Francisco League team. The
last game before the Intercollegiate
next Saturday will be with the San
Francisco nine on April 3d.
The Cardinal is in excellent con
dition for the big games, and the
few rough edges that are evident
now will be carefully smoothed out
during the next week. The prac
tice during vacation week will be
fast and hard. At ten o'clock every
morning the men will appear for
batting practice. At three o'clock
they will play a game between the
first and second nines.
The condition of the Cardinal at
the present time is a source of grat
ification to everyone. Those who
were most doubtful and pessimistic
at the beginning of the season as to
Stanford's chances in the Inter
collegiate contest are now most
willing to concede that the Cardi
nal has an even chance to win the
series.
Coach Swindells has exceeded
the hopes that were expressed for
him, and has worked wonders with
the almost green bunch of baseball
candidates that presented them
selves at the beginning of the year.
With only three old men back he
started in with anything but a
bright outlook. Yet by hard, con
sistent work he has selected a team
of men who play together like clock
work. He has been ably assisted
by Captain Cowden, who has
worked unceasingly with the feel
ing that Stanford must win.
It is impossible, of course,to give
a complete forecast of the Stanford
nine now,one or two of the positions
being still in doubt. One that con
cerns most is the pitcher's box. The
contest is no nearer a decision than
a week ago. The race is hot be
tween McFarland and Parker.
Some new bleachers will be
moved over to the baseball field
next week, and seating accomoda
tions will be provided for about six
hundred people.

The Varsity played Belmont
School at Belmont this afternoon,
and tomorrow they will meet the
San Francisco League team. The
last game before the Intercollegiate
next Saturday will be with the San
Francisco nine on April 3d.
The Cardinal is in excellent con
dition for the big games, and the
few rough edges that are evident
now will be carefully smoothed out
during the next week. The prac
tice during vacation week will be
fast and hard. At ten o'clock every
morning the men will appear for
batting practice. At three o'clock
they will play a game between the
first and second nines.
The condition of the Cardinal at
the present time is a source of grat
ification to everyone. Those who
were most doubtful and pessimistic
at the beginning of the season as to
Stanford's chances in the Inter
collegiate contest are now most
willing to concede that the Cardi
nal has an even chance to win the
series.
Coach Swindells has exceeded
the hopes that were expressed for
him, and has worked wonders with
the almost green bunch of baseball
candidates that presented them
selves at the beginning of the year.
With only three old men back he
started in with anything but a
bright outlook. Yet by hard, con
sistent work he has selected a team
of men who play together like clock
work. He has been ably assisted
by Captain Cowden, who has
worked unceasingly with the feel
ing that Stanford must win.
It is impossible, of course,to give
a complete forecast of the Stanford
nine now,one or two of the positions
being still in doubt. One that con
cerns most is the pitcher's box. The
contest is no nearer a decision than
a week ago. The race is hot be
tween McFarland and Parker.
Some new bleachers will be
moved over to the baseball field
next week, and seating accomoda
tions will be provided for about six
hundred people.
