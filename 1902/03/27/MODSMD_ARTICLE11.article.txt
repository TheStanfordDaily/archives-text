Stu dents going away from the
University for vacation should bear
in mind the fact that the first base
ball game of the Intercollegiate
series will be played on the .Stan
ford campus April sth. This is
Saturday, two days before Univer
sity work is resumed. The issue of
the first game may depend largely
on the support which the student
body gives our team. As there can
be only three games in the series,
the institution winning the first
one has a decided lead in the
chances for victroy.
