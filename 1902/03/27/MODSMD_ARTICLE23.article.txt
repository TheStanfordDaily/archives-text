## 
### 
The Junior day number of the
Chaparral, which came out today, is
the best issue of the year. Per
haps the two best features are
"Theatrical Notes" accompanied by
illustrations by Bonnell, and "Lec
tures on the Word 4 Kiss'." Espec
ially interesting is a production l>y
Hur, ex-'O?, and a full-page illus
tration by R. C. Bubb, '04. There
is some readable verse, notably
"Some Plug Thinks," ''Consola
tion," and "At the Junior Farce."
"A Hobo's Idea of Heaven" is ef
fective, if not artistic. The editor
ials might well he characterized as
"exhaustive." Joshes there are in
plenty, of the usual standard; one
of them is so good, in fact, that it is
repeated on another page. "The
Spirit of Junior Day," a remark
able drawing by Borough, ex-'Ol,
is issued as a supplement.
