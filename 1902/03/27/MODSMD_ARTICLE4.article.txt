###

The style of architecture is clas

arcade along the entire distance,
with eighteen huge columns run
ning to the roof. The building will
be two stories high, surmounted by
a huge dome. The stone will be

buildings.
The interior will have a canvas
running track, swimming pool,
bowling alleys, training quarters,
kitchen and dining-room for train
ing tables, many showers, both hot
and cold; sufficient tubs, and dry
ing-rooms. The equipment is to be
complete in every sense of the word.
In addition, arrangements a re being
made for a covered track adjacent
to the Gymnasium in the forty
acres of land that are to be devoted
to athletics. The track is to lie a
quarter mile in length, and the in
terior is to be used for football and
baseball. The roof will be arranged
so as to be opened and closed as
the weather permits.
The present program is to rush
the foundations to enable the cor
nerstone to be laid before the close
of the present semester. The plans
provide for one of the most beauti
ful and fully-equipped gymnasi
ums in the world. Mr. Storey,
gymnasium instructor, and Trainer
Moulton went over the plans this
morning, and both pronounce them
the most comprehensive they have
ever seen, excelling anything else
in the country.
