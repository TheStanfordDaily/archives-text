# ONE FOR BERKELEY
## University of California Wins First Game of Intercollegiate Championship Series. 
### 
In a contest that was close and
exciting almost to the very finish,
the University of California on
Saturday won the first of the Inter
collegiate baseball series from
Stanford by a score of 6 to 3. The
game was less decided than the
score would seem to indicate —at
times it was anybody's game.
There were thrills enough, too, to
satisfy the oldest living graduate.
The weather was threatening all
day, drizzling rain having started
early in the morning. The rain
stopped, however, before ten o'clock
and the diamond was perfectly dry
when the teams appeared for prac
tice at two o'clock. The uncer
tainty of the weather kept many
people away, and the attendance
from Berkeley was unusually
small. About seven hundred
persons saw the struggle.
The contest commenced sharply
at '2:30 with Stanford at the willow
and cheers came up alternately
from the Cardinal and the Blue
and Gold as each gained fora
moment a brief, fleeting advan
tage. That California won was
dua entirely to the superb pitching
of Overall. The Stanford men were
able to find time for only four hits,
and these were well scattered. The
fielding of the teams was about
equal. The home team was un
able to land on Overall's delivery
with safety. Nearly every batter
pushed little easy grounders to the
infield and was put out handily.
The Stanford nine never played
in better form than on Saturday.
There was quickness and precision
about their playing that the Ber
keley men failed to show. Yet at
one or two critical points in the
contest the Cardinal's representa
tives fell down. Crawford and
Cowden both missed chances for
double plays, but with the excep
tion of a bad throw by Copp to
Blake, and McFarland's missing a
a throw from left field, the playing
of Stanford was excellent.
It was evident from the start that
the result of the game was to be
decided entirely by stick work.
Overall and Braly received the
honors in this part of the game,
the latter getting a hit every time
at the bat. The hits made by the
home |Pam were made at important
points and brought in runs. Both
pitchers were in excellent condition.
McFarland pitched a rattling good
game. There was a particular ab
sence of star playing. Both nines
did good, hard work, but the few
errors that were made were of the
bad, inexcusable sort that discour
age a team.
McGilvray caught splendidly,
and brought in the first run by a
safe hit between short and third.
Blake played well at first, and
made several fine stops of bad
throws. Copp, Crawford and Cow
den covered their positions well,
while Lowenthal was the particular
star in the field. It is hard to say
who did the best fielding work for
California. Hendrick covered the
initial bag in a creditable manner,
and Kennedy and Adams both

fielded their positions well. Hatch
was unable to hold Overall's deliv
ery very well, and the Stanford
players had no trouble in stealing
bases on him.
The second contest of the series
will be played off on the Berkeley
campus on Saturday of this week,
April 12th.
