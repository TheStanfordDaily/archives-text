# SOPHOMORES WON THE MEET.
## Henley Injured, Cannot Enter Field-Day.—Smith Breaks Stanford Record in Quarter. 
### 
The Sophomores won in the Class
field-day on Junior day, March
28th, with 47 points. The Juniors
were next with 45, the Freshmen
third with 26, and the Seniors
fourth with 6. Henley, whose
jumping had shown a return to his
old-time form, after clearing the
bar easily at 5 feet inches, un
derwent a "break-down" in an
ankle which will prevent his taking
part in the Intercollegiate this year.
This is the most serious blow the
track team has yet received, and is
a climax of the many accidents
which have already befallen it.
Bubb, a promising young sprinter,
was also laid off by injuries, and
can do no more work this year.
The meet was satisfactory in
many respects. Smith won the
quarter in 51 2-5, breaking the
Stanford record of 51 3 5, held by
Brunton, ex-'99. Henley and Bell
made 5 feet inches in the high
jump, tying the University record
held by G. S. D01e,'99. Hamilton,
who now holds the University re
cord of 22 4-5 for the 220, ran the
event in 2&, which is a fifth of a
second below the record that stood
b^lor^. ? tjbe_.U,kiah meet.
performances of Hawley, the
Junior captain, were a surprise to
every one. He took places in the
hundred, two-twenty, and shot-put,
events for which he had not trained.
The closest finish of the day was
that in the low hurdles between
Kuhn, '03, and Taylor,'o4. Kuhn
had the besftt of it by a few inches
when at the last hurdle he stumbled
slightly and lost the race. Dunn
finished cloVe to Smith; Watson and
Davis ran their relays in 53 seconds
or under.
The thoroughness of the training
which the men have undergone was
evident. Those who last year could
not get under 54 seconds in the
quarter, made it in less than 52.
Several of the men entered one
event after another apparently
without fatigue.
v- A-Nunpleasant feature of the
Hfieet Was tiie unannounced delay
caused by the kicking of one or two
of the athletes against points which
had already been decided. Four
different times were the class cap
tains called together, and each time
was their decision against the
giickai:.

in the two-mile, won the only places
for the Seniors. The Freshmen did

The Sophomores won in the Class
field-day on Junior day, March
28th, with 47 points. The Juniors
were next with 45, the Freshmen
third with 26, and the Seniors
fourth with 6. Henley, whose
jumping had shown a return to his
old-time form, after clearing the
bar easily at 5 feet inches, un
derwent a "break-down" in an
ankle which will prevent his taking
part in the Intercollegiate this year.
This is the most serious blow the
track team has yet received, and is
a climax of the many accidents
which have already befallen it.
Bubb, a promising young sprinter,
was also laid off by injuries, and
can do no more work this year.
The meet was satisfactory in
many respects. Smith won the
quarter in 51 2-5, breaking the
Stanford record of 51 3 5, held by
Brunton, ex-'99. Henley and Bell
made 5 feet inches in the high
jump, tying the University record
held by G. S. D01e,'99. Hamilton,
who now holds the University re
cord of 22 4-5 for the 220, ran the
event in 2&, which is a fifth of a
second below the record that stood
b^lor^. ? tjbe_.U,kiah meet.
performances of Hawley, the
Junior captain, were a surprise to
every one. He took places in the
hundred, two-twenty, and shot-put,
events for which he had not trained.
The closest finish of the day was
that in the low hurdles between
Kuhn, '03, and Taylor,'o4. Kuhn
had the besftt of it by a few inches
when at the last hurdle he stumbled
slightly and lost the race. Dunn
finished cloVe to Smith; Watson and
Davis ran their relays in 53 seconds
or under.
The thoroughness of the training
which the men have undergone was
evident. Those who last year could
not get under 54 seconds in the
quarter, made it in less than 52.
Several of the men entered one
event after another apparently
without fatigue.
v- A-Nunpleasant feature of the
Hfieet Was tiie unannounced delay
caused by the kicking of one or two
of the athletes against points which
had already been decided. Four
different times were the class cap
tains called together, and each time
was their decision against the
giickai:.

bourne in the half, and McLaughlin
in the two-mile, won the only places
for the Seniors. The Freshmen did
