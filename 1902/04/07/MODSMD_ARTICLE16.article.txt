# THE 						JUNIOR FARCE.
## Performance Given to Large Crowd. Parts Well Carried. Costuming Good. 
### 
The Junior Farce, Pkwtnopfu,
written by Wagner, '02, and John
son, '03, and staged under the di
rection of Louis Weer, on the night
before Junior day, was very suc
cessful, with the exception of the
long waits between acts. A large
and good natured audience was
present, and the farce will net a
good sum for the Juniors.
The plot, which has been pre
viously outlined, was novel and
well carried out, and the curtain
raiser was an especially well ren
dered scene. J. K. Bunnell made
an excellent over-zealous and pon
derously deep professor. The
awakening in the first act of Alfred
Marlin at Tahiti after a thousand
years' sleep, and his return to Stan
ford in the next act, were subjects
of great possibilities. Added to
this phenomenon, the love of Mar
lin for Limona, of 2903, who resem
bled his sweetheart of the time be
fore his sleep, and the explanations
and illustrations of "queening" by
the awakened man to this fair
Stanfordite, gave a pretty romantic
touch to the farce.
The special stunts were the best
features of the play. Baker and
Bush as Pktopu and Zero brought
down the house with their "Hale
loco" song, and were forced to
respond to numerous encores.
Young's dream of "Antigone" and
Richardson's "plug" act were de
cidedly good. The costuming and
singing were excellent, and the or
chestra under A. J. Copp's leader
ship gave eflicient service. Much
of the music was composed by
Wagner, and was novel and well
suited to the play.
All the parts were well carried.

Miss Soule as Limona, the keenest
co-ed, was well suited to her role,
and showed a great amount of real
talent. Miss Higgins as Limona's
aunt was a staid and dignified
chaperon, while Miss Edwards as
the food maiden, Pabula, and Miss
Dustan as Opia, the sleep maiden,
were charmingly graceful and well
suited to their parts. G. H. Baker
as Prince Pktopu, president of
2903, was all that a prince could
be in proudnees of carriage and in
haughtiness; while W. Young was
a typical bluff, good-spirited Stan
ford fellow. A perfect type of fos
silized professor was found in A.
Richardson, '04, Back Numbro;
and R. E. Renaud, who played the
part of Retori, demonstratory in
dictory,and with butan hour'sprep
aration, made a first-rate "butt-in
sky." The smile of H. E. Bush as
Zero, secretary of '03, his costume,
and his typewriter were extremely
funny. Bush's smile convulsed
the audience. H. H. Atkinson as
His pee, the spirit of rapid transit,
performed daringly on roller skates.
H. Balkan and E. C. Eppley as
lludo and Keno, the plotting Soph
omores, played their parts in a
very realistic manner. The "Lim
sies," G. V. Lowry and R. Leib,
were hideous and truly oriental in
their stealthy movements.
