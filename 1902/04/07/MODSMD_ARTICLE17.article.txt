### 
Following the Junior Farce on
Thursday evening, March 27th, the
Zetes gave their annual smoker.
About fifty upper-classmen were
guests, and various forms of enter
tainment were provided. W. Young,
'04, J. K. Bunnell,' '02, Frank
Branch Riley, '00, of Portland;
Charley Field, '95, of San Fran
cisco, and others present responded
to calls for stories and readings.
Maker and Bush did several of their
stunts. F. B. Wagner, author of
the farce, was called on fora
speech, and closed his remarks by
proposing a toast to Zeta Psi, the
hosts of the evening. The enthus
iasm with which this was received
indicated the thorough enjoyment
of the guests.
