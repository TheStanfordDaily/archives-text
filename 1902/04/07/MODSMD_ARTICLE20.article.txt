# GAMES IN VACATION.
## Record of Scores Made by the Varsity in Contests Before the Intercollegiate. 
### 
On March 27th the Varsity de
feated the Belmont School at Bel
mont by the score of 13 to 7 in a
slow and uninteresting contest.
Parker and McFarland did the box
work for the Cardinals.
On the afternoon of Junior day
the Stanford team met defeat at
the hands of the San Francisco Pro
fessionals by the score of 14 to 3.
The Varsity played poor ball, and
showed none of the form it ex
hibited in the game against the
same team on Thursday, April 3d.
This latter was the final contest be
fore the Intercollegiate game, and
the result was undecided until the
last half of the ninth. The score
was tied, and two of the Profession
als were out, when Crawford fum
bled a hard ground hit, letting in
the winning run. The Varsity
played in excellent form, and gave
the Leaguers a narrow escape.
Saturday, March '29th,the Alumni
were defeated 3 to 2 in a good game.
The detailed scores of the games
since the last issue of the Daily
Palo Alto are given below:

On March 27th the Varsity de
feated the Belmont School at Bel
mont by the score of 13 to 7 in a
slow and uninteresting contest.
Parker and McFarland did the box
work for the Cardinals.
On the afternoon of Junior day
the Stanford team met defeat at
the hands of the San Francisco Pro
fessionals by the score of 14 to 3.
The Varsity played poor ball, and
showed none of the form it ex
hibited in the game against the
same team on Thursday, April 3d.
This latter was the final contest be
fore the Intercollegiate game, and
the result was undecided until the
last half of the ninth. The score
was tied, and two of the Profession
als were out, when Crawford fum
bled a hard ground hit, letting in
the winning run. The Varsity
played in excellent form, and gave
the Leaguers a narrow escape.
Saturday, March '29th,the Alumni
were defeated 3 to 2 in a good game.

since the last issue of the Daily
