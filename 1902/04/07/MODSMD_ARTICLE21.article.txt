# The
						Junior Prom.
## 
### 
About one hundred couples were
present at the Prom, which occurred
on the evening of Junior day. Ow
ing to the Lenten season not hav
ing closed, the crowd was some
what smaller than at the two pre
ceding class dances of the year, but
the floor was less crowded and the
dancers bad more room.
The committee, consisting of
Miss Jane Evans, Miss Genevieve
Chambers, Miss Mabel Brown, and
\V. B. Barnhisel, W. B. Lowenthal,
E. Fogg and B. E. Nourse,
chairman, had utilized the Junior
plug as the feature for decoration.
Nearly all the hats in the class
had been collected. They were sus
pended on wire across the ballroom
—some of them without crowns,
some minus rims, and all showing
the scars of battle and hard usage.
Near the fireplace a dummy Me
phistopheles recalled the ceremony
at which the class emblem was
dedicated last fall. The lights
were partially shaded. Greens
and plants were used in the lobby,
giving it a cosy, conservatory effect.
In securing Yanke's band of
twelve pieces the committee made
a hit, for the music was excellent
A supper, including oyster patties,
chicken salad, sandwiches, and
coffee, was served during the tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth dances. Selt
zer punch and lemonade were also
served during the entire evening.

place, were: Mrs. Jordan, Mrs.

throp, Mrs. Grandin, Mrs. Kitch
