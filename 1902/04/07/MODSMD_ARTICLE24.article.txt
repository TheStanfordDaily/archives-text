A new steel bridge for the double
track is being built across San
Francisquito creek. The Southern
Pacific Company has purchased
from the Stanford estate a strip of
land on the south side of the right
of way between Palo Alto and
Menlo Park. This will make pos
sible the laying of the second track
on that side of the present track,
which will leave the Palo Alto tree
undisturbed. The station building
at Palo Alto will be moved further
back and about one hundred feet
