# Students in the Toils.
## 
### 
As the result of a jollification
held on the stairway leading to
Nortree Hall Thursday night, three
Stanford men are now under arrest
and fifteen more are scheduled for
prosecution in case convictions are
secured. The arrests were made at
the instigation of David A. Curry,
formerly a graduate student of
Latin at Stanford, and now a
dealer in furniture and proprietor
of Nortree Hall in Palo Alto. The
mob of students waiting outside
the hall for admission to a theat
rical performance, carried their
hilarity farther than Mr. Curry
believed was warranted even by
the traditional right of students to
"rough-house" wandering Thespi
ans, hence his action in causing
the apprehension of F. E. Nangle,
'03, T. M. Coen, '05, and M. H.
Newberg, '02, whom he had recog
nized. Two of them pleaded not
guilty to the charge of disturbing
the peace, and the date of their
trial will be fixed tomorrow.
