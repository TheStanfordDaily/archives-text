night of April 26th in Metropolitan
Hall in San Francisco, have been
chosen. The team is made up of
Ralph S. Pierce, Walter Rothchild,
Max Thelan, and F. M. Allen as

both new men, over the heads of
two members of the last Carnot
team.

collegiate which defeated Stanford
last year. He entered the debating

oped during the past three years

Lowell high school, was a substi
tute on the Carnot team last Feb
ruary, and has twice represented
the Hastings College of Law against
the Students Congress of Berkeley.

Francisco.
