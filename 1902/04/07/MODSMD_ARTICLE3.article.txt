On this same date another Stan
ford team will meet the University
of Nevada athletes at Reno. The
names of those who will make the

be the try-outs tomorrow. A num
ber of men will be started in the
quarter, and an interesting race be
tween Dunn and Smith will result.
Burton will attempt to lower his
record for the two miles. Chad
bourne and Thomson will run in
the half, and other try-outs will be
held.
