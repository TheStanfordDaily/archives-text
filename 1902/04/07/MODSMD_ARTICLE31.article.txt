yoke, allowing the surrey to strike
against the back of the horses,
which became frightened and
dashed down the bill. Finally the
team broke loose, and the surrey
was upset, rolling down a twenty
foot embankment and spilling the
two ladies. Beyond a broken rib
which one of the ladies sustained
there were no other injuries.
