On our own campus Stanford
lost the first game of the Intercol
legiate baseball series, in an exhi
bition that was one of the best ever
seen between the two universities.
Although Stanford supporters would
have been pleased if the score had
been reversed, they are proud of
the nine that made such an excel
lent fight last Saturday. The con
test was one of good, clean sport
throughout. With six members of
the team who never had played on
the Varsity before, meeting a nine
seven of whom were experienced
from former seasons, the Cardinal
made a wonderful showing. Cali
fornia had expected an easy victory,
but she did not find it. Our op
ponents won, but not without play
ing the best ball they could. Ex
cept for the work of Overall in the
box and at the bat, the performace
of the Cardinal players was prob
ably superior, as a whole, to that
of their rivals. Coach Swindells
and all the men have earned con
gratulations and the warmest ap
preciation for their success in over
coming the many disadvantages
and discouragements of the season
and in turning out so strong a
team. The students of the univer
sities are fortunate this year in
being able to see such good base
ball. The second game occurs next
Saturday. With another week for
practice, our own men may succeed
in wresting victory from Califor
nia on its home campus.
