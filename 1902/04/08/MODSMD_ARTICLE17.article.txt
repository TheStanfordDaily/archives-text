The communication signed by
"Ninety-five," published in this is
sue, was received through the mail
too late for the paper last evening.
It is a manifestation of the old pio
neer spirit which every student in
the University will endorse. The
call must not be disregarded. As
the writer says, the feeling that
the whole University appreciates
their work will do more to give the
team heart and aggressive determi
nation for the second game than
most people realize. It is in such
crises as this that the Stanford
spirit arises to the occasion. No
one can read the communication
without being infected with the en
thusiasm. Yes, "let us show our
friends across the bay that we are
proud of our ball team and mean
to see this thing through."
