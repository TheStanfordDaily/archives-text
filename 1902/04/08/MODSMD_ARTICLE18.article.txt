# The 						Rhodes Scholarships.

### 
The will of Cecil Rhodes, which
was made public Friday, provides
for the establishment of two scholar
ships at Oxford to each of the pres
ent states and territories of the
United States. Each scholarship
has a value of $1500 a year and is
tenable for three years.
Regarding the American scholar
ships Rhodes said: "Whereas, I
desire to encourage and foster an
appreciation of the advantages
which I implicitly believe will re
sult from a union of the English
speaking peoples throughout the
world, and to encourage in the stu
dents from the United States who
will benefit, from these scholarships
an attachment to the country from
which they have sprung, but with
out, I hope, withdrawing them or
their sympathies from the land of
their adoption or birth."
This endowment of American
scholarships is the more remarkable
in view of the fact that Rhodes be
stowed fifty per cent more scholar
ships than in the British Empire.
This gift is the occasion of gen
eral rejoicing throughout the Eng
lish-speaking world.
