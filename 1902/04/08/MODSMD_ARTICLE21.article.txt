Coach Courtney gave the candi
dates for the Cornell crews a lesson
which they will not soon forget, a
couple of days ago. At one stroke
he fired nine of the strongest men
in the university because they did
not obey his rules of training and
retire at ten o'clock at night.
A week ago the old man told the
boys they must get down to busi
ness. A week from tonight he was
to start the training; but last night
a show came to town, and, with
the prospect of having a rough
house, Ballinger, Merrill, Edmon
ston, and Kuschke of the first var
sity shell members of last year's
crew, and CoHin, Thomson,Torney,
and Nutting of the second varsity,
as well as Bruce of the four-oared
combination, could not stand the
temptation and attended the thea
ter. When they reported for work
at the boat-house this morning they
were thunderstruck at the orders
received for theni to "take clothes
and go."
In addition to the men fired, sev
eral of the candidates are out of
town, and there are rumors that
they will find themselves in ill
favor when they return.
Merrill and Coffin were the
strongest stroke oars in the univer
sity, and their loss will be keenly
felt. There is no indication that
the old man will rescind his orders,
for he has gone to work and made
up two crews and training goes on
just as before.
In 1899 Coach Courtney adopted
a similar course of action to teach
the men that his rules must be ob
served. On that occasion the var
sity oarsmen ate shortcake and the
crew was fired en masse. Only a
few of them ever got back to their
old places, and it is now feared
that this will be the result of to
day's action. In 1898, however,
Coach Courtney turned out one of
the fastest combinations that ever
rowed for Cornell.
The discharged candidates assert
that they will stand together, and
no one will return without all the
others.
