# PROUD OF THE TEAM.
## A
						Ringing Call from "Ninety-Five" to Support the Baseball Men This Week.

Sir:— I think every Stanford man
who saw last Saturday's base
ball game will heartily endorse
me when I say that the showing
made by Stanford's team, in the
face of heavy odds, was such as to
deserve the unqualified admiration
and applause of the entire Univer
sity. It was a plucky up-hill game
from start to finish, and, though
nominally a defeat, was a defeat
which has brought more real satis
faction to all thoughtful observers
of Stanford athletics than could
come from many easily earned vic
tories. 1 have seen a number of
games between crack Eastern teams
—such as Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton—but I never saw a better
article of baseball, or a belter ex
hibition of never-say-die lighting
spirit on any amateur diamond,
bar none.
Next Saturday we are to face the
California team again. The odds
are, of course, in their favor. But
with the added confidence which
will come to our new men from Sat
urday's experience, and with the
aid of just a little better luck in
solving Overall's delivery, it should
occasion no surprise if we manage
to pull off a Cardinal victory.
To make this possible every loyal
Stanford student should consider it
a point of conscience to give the
nine his heartiest support during
the present week. It will be a long
time before we have a chance of
supporting a better team, or a
grittier, and the feeling that the
whole University appreciates their
work will do more to hearten the
men than most people suspect. Let
us, every man and woman of us,
make this fight our own; let us turn
out for practice as regularly as
the players do, and when the day
of the match comes let us show our
friends across the bay that we are
proud of our ball team, and mean
to see this thing through.
Ninety- five.
