# The 						Heinrich Song Recital.
## 
### 
Mr. Max Heinrich and Miss
Julia Heinrich, who have been
singing before crowded houses in
San Francisco during the past
week, will give a song recital here
next Friday evening. Their pro
gram will consist of solos and duets
by Schubert, Schumann, and
Brahms, and a special feature of
the evening will be the singing by
Mr. Heinrich of several German
student songs in the beautiful com
positions of Adolph Jensen. It. is
not claiming too much that the two
artists, while resembling the Hen
schels in their work, far surpass
them in strength and artistic fin
ish.
