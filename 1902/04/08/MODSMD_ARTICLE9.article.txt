# PLAY AT SANTA CLARA.
## The
						Varsity Will Meet the Collegians on Their Own Diamond Thursday. 
### 
The Varsity goes to Santa Clara
on Thursday to meet the Catholic
collegians for one more contest be
fore the decisive game of next Sat
urday. This will he the last game
that will he played before the
wearers ol the Cardinal cross the
bay for a second struggle with the
lilue and Gold.
The men were out last night
getting into shape for the big bat
tle. All the players were in their
usual places except Lowenthal,
whose non-appearance sent Kellogg
to the left field. Some fast, snappy
practice was taken up for forty min
utes, and later there was a game
with a much patched-up second
team. McFarland was given a rest
after his vigorous exercise of Satur
day, and Triteh and Parker did the
delivery work.
Every man started in the final
week of practice with vim and de
termination to make the most of
the few days before the next inter
collegiate contest, and the result of
last night's practice indicates that
the score of the game on the Berke
ley campus will be fully as close
and small as Berkeley's victory
Saturday. The usual matches with
the second team will be continued
through this week.
