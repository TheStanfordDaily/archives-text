# TALK ON ANTIGONE.
## Professors Will Speak in Chapel Tomorrow Evening Regarding Greek Tragedy. 
### 
Antigone in all its aspects as a
tragedy will be discussed tomorrow
evening in the chapel. It will be
an evening of enlightenment. Dr.
Fairclough, Dr. Murray, and Dr.
Jordan will address the students
upon the story of the tragedy, its
historical value, and its present in
terest.
As the time for the production
draws near the work of those who
are to take part is being perfected,
and from now on it is largely a
question of putting on the finishing
touches. Much of the work of prep
aration has centered in the train
ing of the chorus, which is a very
important element. Historically
the chorus represents the first con
dition of tragedy, when it was
wholly logical. In the case of An
tigone there is an intimate connec
tion between the choral and dra
matic parts. The chorus Berves as a
link between actors and spectators,
and also to interpret the spiritual
meaning of the play, and point a
moral to the calamities predicted.
This Antigone chorus represents
the elders of the state, who are
grave and revered old men. Their
movements are directed by a leader
called Coryphaen√ü, who addressed
the actors, and is therefore a dra
matic personage. In most former
representations the chorus bus been
on a lower stage, but not many
years ago the investigations of Dr.
Dorpfeld have lead most scholars
to believe that in the old Creek
theatre the orchestra and stage
were on the same level. This prin
ciple will be followed in the present
presentation.
All Greek plays had a musical
setting, but in as much as ancient
music is lost, resource must be had
to modern art. In the case of the
Antigone there is the magnificent
music of the great Mendelssohn.
It is considered the finest choral
music ever written for men's voices
alone. This use of modern music,
though composed with the the dis
tinctive idea to ancient Greek,
necessitates a. concession of modern
conditions, and therefore a regular
orchestra is to be employed, and a
supplementary chorus will give the
desirable volume of sound.
It is safe to say that from every
point of view, musical, dramatic,
scenic, the Antigone performance
will outclass any that has ever ap
peared in our community. The
whole music for this performance is
under the direction of Mr. Scott
Brook.
