Practically all of the students
of the University, as well as the
track men who have signed the
petition, will give unqualified and
urgent endorsement to the request
that the Executive Committee make
a contract to hold Trainer Moulton
for a term of years. Unless this is
done soon, we may lose him. Mr.
Moulton has received a number of
tempting offers from universities in
the East, it is of vital importance
that he he retained at Stanford.
The new epoch in track work here
has been inaugurated since his ar
rival. More consistent develop
ment, a greater interest on the part
of the men, and a more rigid ob
servance of training rules have
distinguished this season from any
previous one at Stanford. The
foundations are laid for record
breakers and winning teams in the
future. Ifowever, unless Mr.
Moulton can be retained to carry
on his work, the advantage gained
this reason will be largely lost.
The interests of our track athletics
demand immediate action.
