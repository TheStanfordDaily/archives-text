Ok the nix intercollegiate events
contested for annually by the two
California universities, one has
gone to Berkeley, one to Stanford,
and four remain undecided. On
form, the field-day should he cap
tured by our rivals, also the tennis
tournament, with the chances in the
Intercollegiate debate in our favor.
It will be readily seen, then, that
the actual battleground for the
year's championship is the base
ball diamond at Berkeley, where
the second match of the series is to
occur on Saturday. That match
we must win, and we can win.
Among players, coach, and student
body there are no two ways of

thinking. The magnificent show-1
ing made by the Stanford nine in
the recent contest may seem to:
have gone unnoticed and unappre
ciated because of the mere fact that
victory passed us by; but our view
of the matter is that if ever a team
deserved the homage of every man
and woman who glory in the name |
of Stanford, such was the team that
faced our rivals last week. And
not only was grit in evidence from ,
first to last, but there was also an '
amount of downright baseball j
ability that caused more than 1
one onlooker to rub his eyes in en-1
deavoring to reconcile what he saw |
with the work of the verdant nov-1
ices who responded to the captain's
call early in the season. Almost!
man for man, the Cardinal team is
today superior to that of Califor
nia. Whatever doubt we may
have had disappeared last Satur
day. The men and their coach
are fired with determination, and
it remains for us to put our loyalty
to the test by getting behind the
team and evening the score of the
year's contests by bringing to Stan- j
ford the baseball championship
which has been snatched from our
very grasp in three successive
series.
