# Listless Work on the Diamond.
## 
### 
The practice of the Varsity last
night was slow and listless. Light
batting exercise was carried on at
first, and the men were given prac
tice in bunting and hitting slow
balls. There was too much of a
tendency on the part of some of the
Varsity men to indulge in horse
play to make the match between
the first and second teams interest
ing, and errors galore were pi led
up against both nines. With but
four days more before the final
struggle with California, the candi

dates failed to show the interest
and enthusiasm that have hereto
fore characterized their daily
practices. All the Varsity candi
dates for pitcher's box were re
lieved from work, and Ballagh and
Htudley were in this position.
The Varsity will go to Santa
Clara tomorrow to meet the Santa
Clara College team. This will he
the last contest for the Cardinal
before the big game at Berkeley on
Saturday. The two clubs will be
made up as follows:
VARSITY. SANTA ULAHA.
