# A 						FAST QUARTER.
## Dunn's Good Time for the Event. Track Men Petition to Retain Trainer Moulton. 
### 
A heavy wind, which hindered j
the men on the back-stretch and j
prevented good time, whs blowing
yesterday afternoon while the track
men were being run on the oval.
Every race was highly satisfactory,
considering the disadvantageunder
which the work was done. Dunn,
Smith, Grossman, Dole, YVatson,
Davis, and Kehrlein finished the
quarter in the order named, Dunn
breaking the tape in 51 2-5 sec
onds, the best he has yet done. The
mile, with Gay, Holman, Nangle,
and Gundrum, was run in 4:54 by
Gay and Holman, Gay winning by
a foot. Luce won a two-twenty
from Moran in time slightly under
24 seconds. Thomson's and Chad
bourne's half-mile was highly sat
isfactory, though the time, 2:05,
was not so good as they have pre
viously made this semester. The
wind made running the high hur
dles in good form an impossibility,
yet the time of Kuhn, 10 4-5, with
Naramore close behind, was good.
The hundred was won by Hamil
ton in 10 2-5, not so fast as he
made earlier in the semester.
Sprague, who has not been doing
work on the track, got out and ran
a half in 2:24. This was a test of
his strength by which Trainer
Moulton is satisfied that when he
goes back in the harness again next
year records will have to be
smashed before he is beaten.
In the lield events little was
done yesterday. Bell cleared
in the high jump and stopped.
Trainer Moulton has received
offers for contracts with several
IS&stern universities. The track
men are thoroughly satisfied with
the work done by him and without
exception endorse the following pe
tition to the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students:
"We, the undersigned, having
the greatest faith in the efficiency
of E. W. Moulton, under whom we
have worked, believe it would be
advisable to obtain a long-term
contract with Mr. Moulton. We
have found him systematic, thor
oughly sincere, and in every re
spect an excellent trainer. His
impress upon our track athletics
has been good and we desire it con
tinued.
"Therefore do we petition the
Executive Committee of the Asso
ciated Students to make an agree
ment with Mr. Moulton for long
term service, and to do so while he
is still open to the signing of a eon
tract."
Appended to the petition are the
names of all those working on the
track under Trainer Moulton.
