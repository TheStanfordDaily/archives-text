# "THE LITERARY ASPIRANT."
## Jack Loudon, at the English Club, Discussed His Relation to the Magazine Editor. 
### 
Jack London, the rising yonng
author, addressed a large meeting
of lite English Club, held at the
Delta Upsilon house last evening.
His article on the subject of liter
ary aspirants in their relation to
the magazine was spicy, polished,
and pleasingly delivered. He said
that just as many of the deepest
thoughts of the age are expressed
in terms of cash, so the immediate
appraisement of the literature sent
to magazine editors is made in
terms of cash. The editor prints
what the people read, and thus it
comes that neither the whole truth
or falsehood is desired, hut instead
"trimmed truth." For the writer
"bread and glory are divorced."
After a song by Miss Edith Eller
beck, accompanied by Miss Alice
Kimball on the piano, Mr. London,
by request, read bis story, "The
God of His Fathers,'' which ap
peard more than a year ago in
McClure's. }Jis reading was sym
pathetic and added to the story.
Miss Sue Bird later sang, and,
following refreshments of ice and
cakes, Waldemar Young closed the
evening with a recital of "Casey at
the Bat."
