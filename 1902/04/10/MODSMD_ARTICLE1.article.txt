# MOULTON FOR NEXT YEAR.
## Contract Signed Between Popular Trainer and Associated Students. 
### 
The track men are much elated
today over the fact that "Dad"
Moulton will he here to coach and
train them for another year. Treas
urer Edwards and Mr. Moulton
came to an agreement yesterday
afternoon, and the Executive Com
mittee of the student body gave its
sanction to the contract last night.
He will have full charge of the
training of athletes and the coach
ing of the track men.
When he came here last Septem
ber Moulton had a hard proposi
tion to face. He had to light
against sentiment, which was not
conducive to the strict keeping of
training rules, and had almost no
material upon which he could de
pend for consistent track work. He
lias gained the confidence of the
men in a way which no man has
ever yet done at Stanford, and
should not the long line of mishaps
such as would have discouraged any
ordinary trainer have occured, the
California team would have had
little chance of winning. As it is
Moulton has already lowered and
equalled several of the Stanford
record s.l
Moulton has led a life such as
few men today can boast of, and
though he is several years past his
fiftieth mile-stone, he is still as full
of enthusiasm anil determination as
when in 1863 he ran away to join
the First Minnesota heavy artil
lery. After the war, while a scout
in the West, he did his first foot
racing among the Indians of the
"Upper Missouri." Soon after
ward, having won the amateur
championship of Minnesota, he
went into the professional class.
He has run over three hun
dred races, and has been beaten
but four times. Of these four, he
re-matched and won three, and "if
the fellow hadn't died," "Dad"
says he would have beaten the
fourth.
Since entering the trainer's field,
Moulton has had phenomenal suc
cess in producing record-breakers
and winning teams. He handled
Keltleman, Skinner, Campbell, and
H. M. Johnson, professional foot
racers of note. In England with
James Collins he won the great
Sheffield handicap, the first Ameri
can to do so. He has trained hose
teams, sprinters, football men,
wrestlers, bicycle racers, and prize
fighters. He began his university
work at Minnesota, where he had
charge of the alhleten for five years.
He was at Michigan one year, at
lowa two years, at Wisconsin two
years, at Vanderbilt two seasons
with the track men, and last year
at Notre Dame. Johnnie Crum,
James 11. Mayhnry, Alvin V.
Kranzlein, I'. J. Corcoran, W.
(iearin, S. Staples, Walter Camp,
and li. B. Richards, all amateur
celebrities, were developed by
Moulton.
Moulton's strong forte in the
training of his men is the confi
dence with which he inspires them.
He urges each man to be a lirst
place man, never to lie satisfied
with a second or third place.
