With Mr. Moulton engaged as
trainer for another year, vvitli the
promise of a new gymnasium and
athletic grounds, and with the ma
terial here for a record breaking
track team, Stanford should begin
planning to enter representatives
in the Olympic games at Chicago
in 1904. A stadium, seating 75,000
people, will he erected for the spec
tators at these games. Men from
all the leading colleges in the coun
try will take part. By working
for this end during the next two
years, we may be able to send men
who will surprise the East and who
will bring records home to Stan
ford. Everyone who goes on the
track should bear in mind the
possibility of the meet at Chicago.
Freshmen and Sophomores now in
the University will be eligible at
that time. No one can foresee
what two years of development
may accomplish. To compete in
the Olympic games will be the
greatest honor open for athletes in
many years. To represent the
Cardinal offers the acme of oppor
tunity to the Stanford track man.
Trainer Moulton will continue here
for one year at least —a contract
for longer time was inadvisable be
cause the plan of management
may be changed witht he building of
the new gymnasium—and he will
be able to carry on the work he
has launched so well. The pros
pect of making up a team for the
Chicago meet will offer an incen
tive for the men to do their
utmost. Now is the time to begin
preparing for the opportunity.
