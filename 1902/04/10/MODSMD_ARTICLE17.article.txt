# Co-ed "Chaparral" Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The co ed number of the Chapar
ral, which the Chappies announced
was to be an April fool number
without any April in evidence, will
be on sale tomorrow. In view of
the ancient Chaparral policy of
knocking co-education, interest is
being manifested to see how well
the ladies can speak for themselves.
The number has been edited by
Miss Mary Caldwell and Miss Ma
bel Brown, with the assistance of a
large board of co editors. Some
novel features are promised.
