# ADDRESSED THE WOMEN.
## Miss Conde, of the Y.W.C.A., Spoke Last Evening on "Spiritual Poise." 
### 
The women of the University who
gathered last night in the chapel to
hear Miss Cond6 were much inter
ested in her clear and stimulating
address upon "Spiritual Poise."
Physical poise, social poise, and in
tellectual poise, whereby the mind
is held open and steady toward
truth, were each in turn discussed
as commendable and desirable.
Each grows possible by attention to
one point, by concentration. The
head and foot become steady when
the eye is fixed unwaveringly upon
a certain spot. Social ease is at
tained when self is forgotten, and
one's interest is fully occupied
with "the other person." And, as
every student well knows, there is
no road to intellectual strength and
control except through concentra
tion upon the study in hand.
Spiritual poise likewise comes
only by strenuous concentration
upon one point. For the quiet,
harmonious, balanced power of a
normal life, the speaker said that
the will must be centered in Cod.
Miss Conde concluded by describ
ing the beautiful simplicity, the ab
solute balance, the perfect assur
ance, and the strength seen in the
character of Jesus of Nazareth,
arising from a single hearted devo
tion to one purpose, and that the
loftiest —to do the will of God.
At the close of the address Miss
Conde met a number of the women.
In accordance with a request for
another meeting, she spoke again
at half-past two this afternoon. At
four o'clock a few of the faculty
ladies met Miss Cond6 at a tea
given by Mrs. Dr. Elliott at her
home.
Miss Conde will be one of the
speakers at the Volunteer Union
meeting to be held on Friday night,
at which will be discussed the re
cent conference of student volun
teers at Toronto.
