# U.C. Against Honor System.
## 
### 
The proposed "honor system'' in
examinations was defeated by a
majority of more than two to one
in the vote which closed yesterday
at the University of California.
Owing to the decided stand taken
by the student body in this matter,
the agitation for an "honor system"
will be dropped.
The following propositions were
submitted for ballot: (1) Do you
favor vesting the entire control of
examinations in the student body?
(2) Do you favor vesting the entire
control of examinations in the
faculty? (3) If a system of stu
dent control could be devised such
that it would lie acceptable to the
faculty and to the great majority
of the student body, would you
give it your active and consistent
support, thus pledging yourself to
support the principle of an honest
examination, and to do everything
in your power to stop the practice
of cribbing wherever it may ap
pear?
The th ii d proposition, the
keynote to the whole plan, was de
feated by a vote of (>6O to 326.
This plan, should it have been ac
cepted, provided for a student
court to try all cases of cheating in
examinations, demanding likewise
that each student act as a detective
among his fellows. Contempt for
anything approaching "telling"
prevented the acceptance of the
scheme.
