# Heinrich Concert Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The Heinrich concert occurs to
morrow evening in the Assembly
Hall and will, no doubt, be largely
attended. The Heinrichs appeared
last evening in San Francisco ami
made one of the big musical hits of
the year. A feature of the enter
tainment is the piano playing of
Max Heinrich. Speaking of the
concert last evening the Chronicle
of today says:
"They have an astonishing reper
toire, and give intelligent and
artistic interpretations of the grace
ful ballads and duets that are dear

to the hearts of music lovers, as well
as the new things which are just
finding their place. The concert
last evening in Metropolitan Hall
was thoroughly enjoyable.
"Miss Heinrich's voice is well
worth the most careful training.
It has timbre of a rare quality, is
broad and high, and deep and full,
and should in time be among the
very best. As it is, her singing is
natural and altogether enjoyable.
"Heinrich was in excellent voice
and a happy mood last evening.
His Schubert and Richard Strauss
songs were delightful, and two of
the gems of the evening were the
Schumann duets by this gifted
father and daughter, whose voices
are most sympathetically attuned."
