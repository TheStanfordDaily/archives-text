# Track Men Go South.
## 
### 
The final arrangements with Oc
cidental College, through their
manager, Theodore Chopin, have
just been made by Captain Mc-
Caughern. Ten men will go South
tomorrow night â€” Captain Mc-
Caughern, Hamilton, Dunn, Hol
man, Hell, 0. E. Hyde, Crawford,
Burton, and two others.
The regular order of events, ex
cept the hurdles and the half-mile,
but including the relay, will be
run through. First places only
will count, the number of men on
the Stanford team being limited, so
that second and third places would
count against them.
McCaughern has thoroughly in
vestigated the charge brought for
ward by the Chronicle of profes
sionalism against Dean Cromwell,
a member of the Occidental College
team, and has found nothing in it.
The feeling that Stanford would
compromise herself in holding a
meet with the Southern team is
therefore of no consequence. Where
the story started from is hard to
determine. Cromwell played foot
ball all last season with Occidental,
and competed in the track meet
with Bomona College and the Uni
versity of Southern California.
