# THE
						BOER CAUSE.
## Ambassador Muller and Commandant Snyman Told of Conditions in South Africa. 
### 
Dr. Hendrick Muller, ambassa
dor of the Orange Free .State to
Holland, and Commandant â–ºSny
man, late chief-of-staff to General
DeWet, lectured in the chapel this
afternoon.
Dr. M til lei* referred to the senti
ment in America in favor of the
Boer cause as the educational result
of the war. The release of Lord
Methuen from captivity he cited as
the latest example of South African
"barbarism." He defined the
rights of the Boers as those of pur
chase and of treaty. The Dutch
were first in the lield; they pur
chased their lands from the natives
in 1652; and in IH/i'i they obtained
the promise of the liritish govern
ment not to meddle in affairs
north of the Orange river. The
concentration camps of the British
were explained and denounced.
There is no doubt of the ultimate
result; for although the Boer army
has been reduced one-half and the
country overrun, they hold more
land in Cape Colony today than
the Transvaal and Orange Free
State combined. Boer rifles and
ammunition are no longer used, for
they fight with British guns "with
which they are now provided for
years and years." A final appeal
was made for Bed Cross aid.
Commandant Snyman gave a
picture of conditions in South
Africa before and after the war,
and illustrated his remarks with
some interesting personal reminis
cences.
