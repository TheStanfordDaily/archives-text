The present week has been em
ployed to the greatest advantage
by the Stanford team. Most of the
time has been devoted to giving
the men batting practice, as it was
in this department of the game
that they fell down last Saturday.
Coach Swindells is exceedingly op
timistic over tomorrow's contest.
When seen this afternoon he said:
"The outcome of the game tomor
row rests entirely on whether our
men can hit Overall. If the team
could have mixed in a few hits
with all their stolen bases in the
first of the series, we would have
had an easy victory, as the home
nine clearly outclassed Berkeley in
base running.
"Overall is a hard man to hit, as
shown by the fact that the San
Francisco League team got only
four hits from him in the last game
between these two nines. I con
sider him fully the equal of any
of the pitchers in the League
today, if our team puts up the
class of ball tomorrow that it did
last Saturday, and does a little
hitting, there can be no question of
the score. The players made only
three errors in the first match, and
I don't expect them to do any bet
ter fielding than this in the coming
st r uggle."
Captain o>»wden will take his
men to San Francisco on the 9:41
train. There will undoubtedly be
a big delegation going from here
for the game, on account of the un
usually low rate of ninety-five
cents for the round trip. These
tickets are good for the 9:41 train
on Saturday morning, and on
any train returning up to Monday
morning.
