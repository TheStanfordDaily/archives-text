At Berkeley tomorrow after
noon the Varsity baseball team will
meet the University of California
in the pivotal contest of the year.
From what we saw 011 our own
campus last Saturday in the first
game of the series, we may expect
an exhibition worth traveling far
to see. Leaving out the considera
tions of partisanship and college
loyalty, any admirer of good base
ball will be well repaid for his trip
to Berkeley. Stanford has a fight
ing chance to win, and for this
reason will fight with all the de
termination at her command. We
already know with what spirit our
men can play. Feeling, as they
do, that so much depends on the
issue tomorrow, and encouraged by
the support of the student body,
their spirit will be intensified. For
many seasons Stanford has lost
the baseball series when it seemed
certain that we should win. Now
the tables may be turned. Al
though our rivals have gained the
first victory this year, we may yet
defeat them. Only a few weeks
ago, in the Carnot, we first over
came the Blue and Gold on its own
campus. The little band of rooters
who went up from here, saw the
contest, and heard the decision,
in the face of a great opposing aud
ience, will always remember their
thrill of triumph when the result
was announced. No doubt the
crowd will be larger at the game
tomorrow. No doubt our team will
will have more support and a
larger volume of sympathy and en
couragement then the debaters had.
The excursion rate of ninety-five
cents to San Francisco and return
will attract a big delegation. But
the students who go to Berkeley
must carry with them that deter
mination which will overcome

every disadvantage, and must in
fuse every player with the feeling
that he is bound to succeed
Then the rooters may enjoy the
same experience that was the for
tune of those who heard the Car-1
not.
Members of the team, we expect j
you to win this, the most iinpor-1
tant intercollegiate ball game for)
many years.
