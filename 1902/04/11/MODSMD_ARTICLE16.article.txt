# DEFEAT SANTA CLARA.
## Varsity Won From Catholic Collegians by Decisive Score of Eight to Four. 
### 
It was easy for the Varsity yes- i
terday to defeat the Santa Clara
College team on the hitter's ground.
The score was 8 to 4, and this does
not show how much Stanford out
classed the Catholic collegians. The
Cardinals solved the puzzle in the
first inning by pounding out four
runs. Two tallies were presented
to the Santa Clara nine in ihe last
inning by Brown dropping a hot
fly.
Parker went to the box first and j
remained for five innings without|
walking a man. McFarland did
the twirling for the last four inn
ings. Cowden, Crawford, and Mc-j
Gilvray played stellar games, and |
the work of the captain was excep
tionally good. Lowenthal played a
good fielding game. The diamond
was in poor shape, and the players
were greatly handicapped for fast
work.
The score follows:
