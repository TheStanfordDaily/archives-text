# DESCRIBED THE PLAY.
## Dr. Murray and Dr. Fairclaugh Told of the Dramatic and Lyric Features of "Antigone." 
### 
Dr. Murray of the Greek depart
ment, and Dr. Fairclough, professor j
of Classical Literature, gave two en
tertaining and instructive lectures
in the chhpel last evening about the
coming presentation of Sophocles'
"Antigone" next Thursday. The in-j
terest of the University in the Greek
tragedy was shown hy the large'
audience, which more than filled
the chapel. President Jordan em
phasized in a few words the value
to the University of a production of
the great drama here, and then in
troduced the first speaker, Dr. Mur
ray, who said in part:
"We have laughed with you over
the jokes about 'the Greek farce.'
But an adequate production of the
Antigone is a serious artistic work,
and demands a great deal of time
and hard study.
The plot of Antigone is a
story of great simplicity, and
the outcome seems inevitable. The
facts are antique, but the principles,
the determining motives, would be
the same today. We must disre
gard poetic justice, when we inter
pret the tragedy, in accepting the
facts of human life. Life is inci
dentally sad, tragic perhaps, but its
possibilities of achievement are in
finite. Antigone, the niece of the|
tyrant Creon, accepts without ques-;
tion the duty of performing the
burial rites over her dead and (lis-1
honored brother, although she
knows that her act will deprive her
of life and all that it holds dear.!
Her soul is not laid bare before lis
as it would be on the modern stage.,
We are made to see the noble pur
pose, the great motive that, never
wavering, impels the girl to sacri
fice herself to save the soul of her
brother from never ending woe.
"Antigone's sister, Ismene, is a
character often misunderstood. She
represents average human nature,
not unlovely, but simply not heroic.
Though she is not brave enough to
join with Antigone in performing
the burial rites over her brother,
she begs to be allowed to die with
her after the act is committed. An
tigone herself repels Ismene, partly
because of the strain she is under,
and partly to save her from the
wrath of Creon. Haemon, Creon's
son who is betrothed to Antigone,
introduces an unusual element in
Greek drama—that of simple,
romantic love. Creon, the tyrant
king, is a well-meaning man, but
too narrow to see that all the right
is not on his side. Finally, when
he realizes all the misery that his
lack of foresight has entailed, he
comprehends his mistakes and gives
way to heartbreaking grief.
"Throughout the Antigone we
never for a moment lo: j e sight
of the artistic greatness of the
G reeks."
Dr. Fairclough fallowed Dr. Mur
ray with a discussion of the func
tion of the chorus in the Antigone.
He sa id:
"The chorus is not an alien ele
ment to the Greek drama, but an
essential part of it. Dramas were
at first purely lyrical, but gradu
ally, as they developed from the

songs of the satyrs, the lyrical part
was subordinated to the dramatic
element. In Aeschylus, the choral
element is still in excess, while
Sophocles represents the high
water mark of Greek dramatists.
He harmonizes the lyric and dra
matic elements with perfect art.
The chorus is an actor, one of the
dramatis personae, in the Antigone.
Its part, though at times hazy and
undecided, is still quite important.
Its attitude gradually changes
throughout the play. It is com
posed of elders, cold and politic ad
visers of the King, who at first
listen respectfully to him and agree
with all he says, but finally plead
with him and influence him. The
most important function of the
chorus is to express in lyrical form
the emotions excited at various
stages of the action.
"The Greek chorus combines
poetry, music, and dance, not
broken up, but all blended into
one. Greek dancing is very differ
ent from our dancing. It is rather
the interpretation of poetry in
bodily form, quite as much by ges
tures and attitudes as by move
ments of the feet. For music, we
have the wonderful composition by
Mendelssohn, which supplies in a
measure the lack of the Greek
music, for Mendelssohn had the
Greek text in mind while he was
composing, and tried to preserve
the Greek rhythm and idea. The
chorus sing their parts mostly in
unison, accompanied by the orches
tra."
