# U.C. WON CHAMPIONSHIP.
## Wonderful Eleven-Inning Game at Berkeley Resulted in Score of 2 to 1. 
### 
In the fiercest and hardest fought
game ever played between the two
universities, California won the
second contest and the Intercollegi
ate baseball series on the Berkeley
campus last Saturday afternoon.
Eleven innings had to be played,
and at the end the score stood 2 to
1. There were many close de
cisions and sensational plays. The
small score indicates just what
kind of a game it was.
The weather was ideal for base
ball. The sun beat down hot upon
the players and the three thousand
spectators in attendance, of whom
about three hundred were Stanford
partisans. The cheering was fre
quent and to the point, free from
unpleasant taunts and personal
ities.
It was 2:15 o'clock when Umpire
Rube Levy called "I'lay ball," and
exactly two hours later Braly drove
a hot liner over second base and
won the game for the Blue and
Gold. Seldom have two more
evenly matched nines struggled for
supremacy. California excelled
Stanford in hitting, getting eight
singles off Parker; while the Cardi
nal gained only five off Overall's
powerful delivery.
Five errors were made by each
side, but they in no way detracted
from the brilliancy of the game.
None of them were costly fumbles,
for the three tallies were all good
earned runs. Stanford had a little
the better of California in fielding.
Although the same story is told in
the error column, the chances of
the Cardinal players were mure dif
ficult. Nearly all the infield drives
were hard tries, while the Stanford
batters invariably knocked little
easy bits when they put the bail in
the infield.
To Brown must be given the
credit of making the game as pro
longed as it.was. His throwing to
second was wonderful, and in the
last of the lirst inning, after Braly
had rapped out a corking hit to
deep center, Brown got the ball and
sent it home straight as a shot and
caught Adams within a foot of the
home plate. Crawford easily
gained the honors in lielding work.
Short-stop for Stanford has seldom
been covered in as brilliant a man
ner as on Saturday. He accepted
ten hard chances without an error.
His throwing was perfect and some
of bis stops were sensational. In
general the throwing of Stan
ford was beautiful. During the
first four iimii.gs three men were
fdiiitoffat home by hair-breadth
decisions.
Parker pitched the game of his
life, lie was cool and steady at
every point of liie contest and
seemed to get stronger as the strug
gle lengthered. Although ho al
lowed eight bits to Overall's five, be
kept them well scattered. .\lc(Â»il
vray caught unusually well, and
allowed only one stolen base.
Blake carried off the baiting hon
ors, getting two singles and bring
ing in Knight for the only run of
Stanford. Kellogg went into
Knight's place at right in the sixth

inning and put up a rattling good
game. Captain Cowden held down
second in his usual brilliant man
ner, taking five hard chances
with hut one error.
Of the California team, Overall
was easily the star. His delivery
work was excellent, striking out
seven men. He kept his hits scat
tered and did not allow the Stan
ford nine a single in the last five
innings. Braly and Adams did
the best stick-work for the Blue
and Gold. The former got three
hits and brought in the winning
run by a timely drive over second.
Hendrick played a very creditable
game at first, and Kennedy and
Adams did their usual work at
third and short. Hatch had diffi
culty in landing Overall at critical
points. The score follows:
