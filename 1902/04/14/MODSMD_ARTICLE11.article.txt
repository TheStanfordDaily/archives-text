Many games of baseball have
been played between Stanford and
the University of California, and
many will be played in the future,
but never before has one been seen
to equal that of last Saturday, and
perhaps not for many seasons will
another such one he known. Stan
ford made her most terrific tight,
and lost. The result and the series
went as had been predicted by
critics all year. But at the begin
ning of the semester if anyone had
prophesied that the teams would
play as they did, he would have
been ridiculed. With six men who
had never been in an intercollegi
ate game, the work wrought by
Coach Swindells is almost marvel
ous. Although the score was not
in favor of Stanford, the student
body can never impress the full ap
preciation it feels for the deter
mined and magnificent light put up
by Captain Covvden and his men. To
have made such a showing against
the team of our opponents is far
greater honor than to have earned
a loose, careless series like some
that have occurred in former years.
California is to he congratulated
for her strong nine, and especially
for her superb pitcher, to whose
work in the box and at the bat is
due the victory of the Blue and
Gold.
In college baseball history on the
Pacific Coast, the present will
stand as a remarkable one. Lei
us hope that it indicates the turn
ing point and promises a continua
tion of good ball for the future.
From practically raw material,
Coach Swindells put out one of the
strongest teams Stanford has
known, and more than that, in
stilled into the men the matchless
spirit which they showed in piny.
With trainer Moulton engaged for

next year, he will continue the
good work done on the track. We
should pursue the same policy with
regard to baseball. The unani
mous feeling is that "Swin" must
be secured for next year.
