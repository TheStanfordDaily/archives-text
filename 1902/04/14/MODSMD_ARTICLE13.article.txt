# Co-ed "Chaparral" Is Out.

### 
The "April fool" number of the
Chaparral appeared today and, if it
is a sample of what may be ac
complished under "a season of miss
rule," it would seem advisable that
the experiment lie repeated "Mr.
Tooley on the Junior Karce" is per
haps the best literary feature, al
though "Mrs. Malaprop to Sir An
thony Absolute" is particularly
good. The most ambitious attempt
in the way of art features is a full
page production by Mary Wellman,
"The Sunset Limited." The first
pnge contains some clever verse on
"The Choir Feline," illustrated by
some inimitable drawings by Mary
V. Martin. Aside from this there
is little verse of note. The notes
on "Society" are clever and well
done, as are the editorials.
The issue was produced under
the editorship of Mary L. Caldwell
and Mabel H. Brown. The "co
editors" are: Hazel Webster, Alice
Kimball, Barbara llitt, Anita B.
Perrin, Mary V. Martin, Mary Gil
man, Mary Wellman, E. H. Mc-
Lauthlin, Ethel Traphagen, Helen
Lamson.
