# Stadium at Olympian Games.
## 
### 
The stadium for the Olympian
games to be held at Chicago in
11)04 will seat 75,000 people, and
cover a ground space of eleven acres.
A special roof has been designed
whereby the stadium may be open
or closed at will. A series of cur
tains on rollers operated by elec
tricity will be used. This unusual
feature will permit the games to be
carried on in rain or shine. The
problem of emptying the stadium
has been met by a division of the
buildings into sections seating 700
people. Each section has its exits.
There are 108 exits and 6 main en
trances. The architect claims that
the building can be emptied of 75,-
000 people in four minutes. Tbe
rows of seats slope from five feet at
the ground row to sixty feet at the
back row. This, together with the
ground plan, will give spectators
an unobstructed view of all that is
going on in the arena. The stad
ium will be so arranged that it can
be divided into three or more
smaller buildings, thus permitting
several different performances to
go on at the same time.
