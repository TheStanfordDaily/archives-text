The University of Chicago is to
have a Men's Clubhouse to be or
ganized an 1 run on plans similar
to the only two other such organi
zations in the country, â€”the Hous
ton Club at the University of Penn
sylvania, and the Harvard Union
at Harvard. The Houston Club
at Pennsylvania has been in suc
cessful operation for six years. It
is maintained by members of the
college; students, alumni, and of
ficers are eligible to membership.
There are five classes of members:
life members with dues of $20; ac
tive members with dues of $2 per
year; associate resident members
with dues of $2; associate non-resi
dent members with dues of $1; and
sustaining members with dues of
$10. Only the active members
vote and hold office. The club is
very popular, a large majority of
the students being affiliated with
it. Frequently the number of stu
dents who daily spend a portion of
their time in the club is over
2,000. The Harvard Union has
been in operation two years and is
managed on much the same plan
as is the Houston Club.
