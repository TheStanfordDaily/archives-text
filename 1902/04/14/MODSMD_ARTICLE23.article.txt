Friday evening, before an inter
ested audience at the meeting in
the chapel of the Bay Volunteer
Union, Miss Cond6 and Miss Mont
gomery, general secretary of the
Y. W. C. A. of the University of
California, told of the spirit and
the work of the Toronto con
vention which closed March 2d of
this year.
The meeting was opened by a
prayer from Dr. Ogden, after which
Mrs. Ella McDowell sang. Secre
tary Harter, of the Y. M. C. A.,
then introduced the first speaker.
Miss Cond6.
Miss Conde began by giving a
brief outline of the Student Volun
teer Movement, from its inception
nearly a century ago at Williams
College, Mass., to its present flour
ishing condition, which found ex
pression at the widely attended
convention held in Toronto last
month. Coming to the work of the
convention, she spoke of the inspir
ing infiuenceof three thousand stu
dent delegates selected as the cream
of the thousands of intellectual men
and women whom they were sent to
represent. After a brief appeal to
all students to remember that ihey
should throw themselves into the
traces, and work with a will for
foreign missions, she closed by giv
ing three reasons for every one feel
ing an interest in the Student Vol
unteer Movement and foreign mis
sions. Briefly thev were: that a
study and participation in such
work has an overwhelming influ
ence for making intelligent stu
dents; that in missionary work
there is a wonderful opportunity
for studying I he results of Christian
ity; and finally, that any one con
nected with missionary work is
nearest that field which was dear to
the heart of Christ.
Miss Montgomery spoke of a
different side of the convention. In
giving a resume of some of the most
striking addresses delivered at To-1
ronto, she showed the extent of the
work carried on in foreign fields by
the Student Volunteer Union. Es
pecially interesting to her was, she
said, Mr. Mott's talk on his tour
among thestudentsof Japan, China,
and India. Miss Montgomery
closed her talk with a wish that all
present might do something to help
evangelize the world.
Before the close of the meeting
Lloyd Harter spoke of the influence
of the Lake Geneva convention.
