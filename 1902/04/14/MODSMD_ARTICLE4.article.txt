# STANFORD 50, OCCIDENTAL 40.
## Fast Time Was Made in the Meet at Santa Monica Last Saturday. A Short Track. 
### 
The track men who went to meet
Occidental College Saturday re
turned this morning, after having
won the meet by a score of 50 to 40.
The events were held at Santa
Monica. The attendance was dis
couragingly small. The greatest
of good feeling prevailed among the
contestants, and the bleachers, 111 led
almost entirely with the black and
gold of the southern college, cheered
Stanford athletes as heartily as
they did their own.
For Southern California it was a
field-day full of record-breaking
performances, and had not the track
been short, the hundred and two
twenty record for the South would
bave been broken. Hyde, with
41 feet 1 1 .J inches to his credit, set
a record in the shot-put. Mc-
Caughern's sprinting was a feature
of the day, the timers catching him
at 10 seconds flat in the hundred,
and 22 1-5 seconds in the two
twenty. Dunn's quarter was run
in 52 3-5 seconds, setting a new
Southern California record. On
measurements the (irst two dis
tances were found to be four inches
short and as a consequence cannot
stand.
Chapin was the star of the col
lege team. He finished both the
mile and two-mile in fine shape,
sprinting across the tape safely
ahead of the Stanford men. The
Los Angeles Timet* characterizes
the meet as '■ as clean and honest
a struggle as ever athletes engaged
in for the laurels of supremacy in
speed and strength.''
The Stanford men enjoyed the
trip and are enthusiastic over the
treatment accorded them by the
Occident a I collegians.
