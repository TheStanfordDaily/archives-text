# STERRETT WINS PRIZE.
## He is the Author of the Senior Farce, "A Rank Outsider." Competition Close. 
### 
Roger J. Sterrett, '02, is the au
thor of the farce entitled "A Rank
Outsider," which has just been
chosen to be presented by the 1902
Glass during Senior week, and is at
the same time the recipient of a
fifty-dollar prize. I'he contest this
year was marked by the fact that
there were seven farces, more than
were ever before submitted. They
were all good, and the committee,
which was composed of John K.
Bunnell, Thoreau Cronyn, Frank
Hinman, Kletcher B. Wagner, and
Miss May Hurlburt, chairman, had
some difficulty in determining
which was the best. The farces
were submitted and read last Fri
day and reconsidered today. Mrs.
W. 11. Irwin has been chosen as
stage manager for the production
of Sterrett's play.
