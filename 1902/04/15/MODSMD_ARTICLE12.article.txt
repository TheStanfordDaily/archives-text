# Comment on New Gymnasium.
## 
### 
In a recent letter from New York
to a friend here, Dr. Murphy, base
ball and track coach last year, Bays:
"L have on all sides heard that you
are to have the best gymnasium in
the world, together with an indoor
track. That certainly will lie fine,
and will mark the beginning of a
new era in athletics there.'' Perhaps
nothing connected with the Univer
sity has excited more comment and
interest than the proposed gymnas
ium as planned by Mr. Hodges.
Kroin friends of the University all
over the United States references
such as-that of Dr. Murphy are be
ing received here.
