### 
The Sunday Chronicle mentioned
in its book review column the work
done by Professors H. A. Fair
clough and A. T. Murray in prepa-;
ration for the presentation of the
Antigone. The Chronicle says:
As a libretto for the perform
ances, Professors H. A. Fairclough
and A. T. Murray of Stanford have,
made a prose version of the great
drama, and have supplemented it
with many notes, especially in re
gard to references to Greek mythol- j
ogy in the strophes of the chorus, j
The prose version is in simple,
strong English, which reminds one
in its expressiveness of Hayward'si
prose translation <>112 Goethe's i
"Faust." Hut in the strophes, i
anti-strophes, and anapests of the 1
chorus, the translators have in- 1
dulged in rhythmic prose that is
full of the power and impressive
ness of the original. The hook is;
printed very clearly, has a title-;
page in black and red, and a very
handsome brown paper cover, with
red letters and gilt border.
