The recent meeting of the Club
Tertulia, held at the Phi Delta
Theta house, was one of tlie most
successful of the club's history.
The musical numbers included
piano and vocal solos by Miss Chita
Kraft and Miss Mercedes De Luna.
The national song of Mexico was
again practiced by the club. The
feature of the evening was a render
ing by I'rofessor Ramsey of the
street cries of Madrid. The calls of
the water-carrier, of many vendors
and early street visitors, were given
as loud as life, and proved fascinat
ing.
Mr. Cortes read a selection of
some length from a modern Spanish
farce. Miss Wright read a number
of letters from friends in Cuba,
prominent in business there. These
letters were interesting as showing
the change of sentiment on the part
of patriotic Cubans as a result of
the United States tariff laws.
A number of parlor games were
played, and refreshments were
served, including pineapple ice and
cakes.
