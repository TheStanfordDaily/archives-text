The evidences of outside interest
that the presentation of Antigone
have called forth are as gratifying
to the professors ii> charge as the)'
are wide-spread. Yesterday after
noon a large number of faculty
members and students of the Uni
versity of California, who will at
tend the Saturday morning per
formance of the Creek drama, met
and read the play in character.
Those who were unfamiliar with
the text followed the reading in
English in order that they might
follow the development of the
drama before witnessing the pre
sentation.
In addition to the large delega
tion from Berkeley, the sale cf seats
in San Jose and San Francisco
gives assurance tlntt both these
cities will be well represented. A
telegram was received today from
an enthusiast in Walla Walla,
Washington, requesting the re
servation of seats for the perform
ance which he will come to see.
The final rehearsals are now be
ing held, and the scenery has been
put up under the personal super
vision of Mr. R. McGreer, the scenic
artist of the Grand Opera House of
San Francisco.
