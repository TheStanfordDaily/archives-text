# READY FOR PRESENTATION.
## Dress Rehearsal of the "Antigone" Promises Most Successful Performance Tomorrow. 
### 
Last night the first complete dress
rehearsal for the Antigone was held
in Assembly Hall with the entire
cast. The scenery was in place and
the performance was carried out
successfully as it will be given to
morrow evening, beginning at eight
o'clock. Another rehearsal is being
held tonight, and everything is in
readiness for the presentation of
the great classic tragedy. The sale
of seats indicates that an immense
audience will be present, both to
morrow evening and at the per
formance Saturday morning.
For Saturday's performance spe
cial trains are to run to accommo
date those who will come from out
side points. The play is to be given
at eleven o'clock. At its close there
will be about an hour for lunch,
and then, very much in the Greek
spirit, athletic games will take
place, the annual track meet be
tween Stanford and Berkeley. In
the evening the Cilee and Mandolin
Clubs ot Stanford and the Univer
sity of California give a joint con
cert, at the close of which a train
leaves for the city.
This Stanford enterprise comes
just twenty-one years after the first
rendering of a Creek play in Amer
ica. In this case, too, Sophocles
was given, the Oedipus Tyrannus,
a drama based upon an earlier
portion of the great legend from
which the subject of Antigone is
drawn, the mighty Tale of Thebes.
The Oedipus has never been re
peated in this country, but another
}»lay of Sophocles, the Electra, has
been given, at Smith. The Antigone
has been played before at Vassar,
at Toronto University, and at
Swarthmore College, near Phila
delphia. A Creek comedy, also,
was put on the stage about a dozen
years ago by the Greek department
of the University of Pennsylvania,
the Acharnians of Aristophanes.
The Antigone has always been a
favorite play with modern audi
ences. In the first place the
music that accompanies it is
extremely beautiful. It was writ
ten by Mendelssohn, and is re
garded as one of the noblest of bis
compositions. It is sung by the so
called chorus, and is accompanied
by an orchestra of thirty pieces
'The orchestra is a University or
ganization. It was developed by
Professor Stewart W. Young, who
generously resigned it for the pur
poses of this performance to Mr.
Scott Brook, the University organ
ist and trainer of the chorus.
It is worth noting that every de
tail of the play, music, acting, cos
tuming, etc., is in the bands of
members of the University. The
costumes were prepared under the
supervision of Mrs. Fairclotigh
and Mrs. Murray. No outside help
of any kind hits been received in
connection with the plav, except
from Mr. Leo Cooper of the School
of Dramatic Expression of San
Francisco. It is doubtful whether
any American college hits ever be
fore given a play so entirely from
its own resources. In this respect,
as in many others, it is very cred

itable to the community and to the
State of California.
The chorus, which has been men
tioned, is a very important and
characteristic feature of the Creek
tragedy. Greek drama developed
from songs and dances in masquer
ade, such as were held in the past
all over Europe, and are still held
in places today, in honor of the
spirit or god of vegetation, at the
winter solstice or time when the
days begin to grow long and spring
seems at hand, and the god is pre
paring to return to the earth. In
Greece, these dances in their nobler
form were stately and beautiful
evolutions. To this service of song,
and those noble and expressive
movement of the body, speakers
and dialogue eventually were ad
ded, until finally the play, as we
understand the word, became "the
thing.'' But the choral part was
always retained, enriching the
drama and helping preserve its re
ligious character. It was moulded
into an essential part of the tragedy
itself.
In the Antigone the chorus is a
body of Theban elders who counsel
the King. They represent the col
lective opinion and enlightenment
of the State. All that, they say
has a connection with the plot and
its development, their spoken word
bearing directly upon the action,
their song interpreting it in its
larger aspects. The important and
difficult part of the leader and
spokesman of the chorus is taken
by Dr. 11. 11. Fai rclough, professor
of Classical Literature, to whose
scholarship and musical ability
much of the excellence of this per
formance of the Antigone is due.
In Antigone the movement is
swift and intense. No sooner are
the character and purpose of An
tigone revealed to us than she
leaves the stage. There is no lin
gering over detail, no statement of
non-essentials—at least of what the
Greek regarded as non-essentials.
So great was the intensity of inter
est and swiftness of action that in
such a play as the Antigone an oc
casional relaxing of the tension
was necessary. And this was af
forded by the choral odes, which,
while contributing in certain ways
to the development of the story and
keeping it, well in the hearer's
mind, yet gave him the delight and
refreshment that must of necessity
come from noble poetry wedded to
music. Then there is in tiie An
tigone another source of relief.
One of the characters, the guard, is
a "character" indeed. His part is
a serious one, and very important
to the action of the play, but still
there is a certain humor in it
which at moments relieves the sit
uation.
This intensity of the play makes
the rendering of it a difficult mat
ter. The acting, nevertheless,
judging from the rehearsals, will
be of remarkable excellence. It
can hardly fail to give great pleas
ure to every lover of the stage,
whether he is able to follow accu
rately the Greek lines or not.
In short, there will be a great
deal in this Greek play to appeal
to every lover of drama or of music.
There will be much that will seem
strange,—the fact that the scene iB

unchanged throughout the play,
the presence on the stage of the
chorus, and many other differences
between the ancient drama and
| the modern, —but the grouping, the
beautiful and varied colors of the
I costumes, the noble music, and the
great excellence of much of the
acting, will be sure to give keen
pleasure to every one who attends.
The chief roles—Antigone, taken
by Miss Cooksey, and Creon, by Dr.
Murray—are performed with great
power and beauty, and many of
the minor parts are most excel
lently rendered.
The scene is laid in Thebes, be
fore the royal palace.
