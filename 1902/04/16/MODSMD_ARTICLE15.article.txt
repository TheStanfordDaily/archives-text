Dr. I). K. Pearson, the friend of
the small colleges, has just cele
brated his eighty-second birthday.
To callers, Dr. Pearson told of the
fortune he will give this year. To
new requests for aid Dr. Pearson
said:
"I have decided not to give an
other cent until the $600,000 L still
owe to a dozen institutions is paid
â€”that is, if they comply with the
requirements first. Crop failures
in the West caused a scarcity of
money, and these trans-Mississippi
colleges had to give up the hope of
getting the additional money in on
time, so J gave them a year of grace.
I have been notified that Whitman
College at Walla Walla has raised
enough money to build its dormi
tory for girls, and 1 shall give it
$50,000 in July. Fairmont Col
lege of Wichita, Kansas, also has
gotten together its fund, and in
July T shall give it $25,000."
