clough's, translation as told in the
introduction to the story, briefly is:
"(Edipus, though unwittingly,
had fulfilled the doom which the
oracle declared should he his: he
had slain with his own hand his
father, Lai'us, and had become the
husband of his mother, Jocaßta.

When the horrible truth became
known, Jocasta hanged herself,
and CEdipus dashed out his eyes
with the brooch of her robe.
"The two sons of the ill-fated
pair fell in deadly combat, —the
younger, Eteocles, seeking to hold
the Theban throne against his
brother, Polynices, who had come
with an alien host from Argos to
claim his rights.
"Creon, the uncle of the two
youths, has become king, and has
declared that the corpse of Polyni
ces shall be left unburied, to be
rent of dogs and birds. To this
edict the citizens submit, and with
them Ismene, one of the two sisters
upon whom, as next of kin, the
duty of paying burial rites to the
fallen chiefly rested. The other
sister, Antigone, in defiance of the
edict gives burial to her brother,
and, sister's child to the king
though she is, and betrothed to his
son Heemon, is herself condemned
to be buried alive in a rocky vault,
where she takes her life.
"Hsemon slays himself in an
guish by the side of his betrothed,
and, learning of this, Eurydice, the
wife of Creon, takes her life, so that
woe upon woe is heaped on the
head of the unhappy king."
