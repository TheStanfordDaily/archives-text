# ENTRIES FOR FIELD-DAY.
## Men From Both Universities Selected to Compete Saturday.—The Events. 
### 
On Saturday afternoon, com
mencing at 2 o'clock, Stanford will
again compete with California for
supremacy on the cinder-path.
Never has the Cardinal won from
the Blue and Gold in a field-day,
and, although things are not as
auspicious as they were some time
ago, owing to the accidents that
have occurred, Trainer Mculton
and his men nevertheless intend to
surprise the Berkeley athletes in
more than one event. What Stan
ford can do, what she will do on
Saturday, it is impossible at the
present time to foretell. The men,
nearly all, have been working hard.
"Jack" McCaughern's perform
ances in Los Angeles last week
promise well for the sprints, with
Hawley, if any slower, a close sec
ond. Abadie for California has, so
far, been running fully as well as
Cadogan. Both heats in the hun
dred will beclosely contested; not a
foot should separate the first and
second men.
The quarter will undoubtedly be
a fast race, as Berkeley's bunch of
entries contains several of her best
men. Dunn, who holds the South
ern California record for (}• ■
Smith, and Grossman have shown
great improvement during thj
season.
Thomson and Chadbourne are
both of them excellent runners and,
matched against Service, who holds
the Coast record, they should make
an interesting race in the half-mile.
This is Thomson's first year on the
track and Chad bourne's fourth.
California seems to have some
the better of it in the mile and two
mile, although Burton in bis event
has done some good work, reducing
his record every time he has gone
the eight laps.
Bell in the field events is an un
known quantity in that, with com
petition, he may even exceed any of
his previous records. With Ilen
ley out, the responsibility of win
ning the high jump and pole-vault
for the Cardinal rests on him. The
work of Cooley, Powell, and Wil
cox from California promises to
make the events close.
With Flaw in the ring, Berkeley
has an easy first in the hammer
throw, and likewise with Hussey in
the broad jump. The shot-put
may be close.
The entries were arranged yes
terday by Captain McCaughern
and Captain Hussey of California,
with the exception of the hurdles,
which will be drawn later.

On Saturday afternoon, com
mencing at 2 o'clock, Stanford will
again compete with California for
supremacy on the cinder-path.
Never has the Cardinal won from
the Blue and Gold in a field-day,
and, although things are not as
auspicious as they were some time
ago, owing to the accidents that
have occurred, Trainer Mculton
and his men nevertheless intend to
surprise the Berkeley athletes in
more than one event. What Stan
ford can do, what she will do on
Saturday, it is impossible at the
present time to foretell. The men,
nearly all, have been working hard.
"Jack" McCaughern's perform
ances in Los Angeles last week
promise well for the sprints, with
Hawley, if any slower, a close sec
ond. Abadie for California has, so
far, been running fully as well as
Cadogan. Both heats in the hun
dred will beclosely contested; not a
foot should separate the first and
second men.
The quarter will undoubtedly be
a fast race, as Berkeley's bunch of
entries contains several of her best
men. Dunn, who holds the South
ern California record for (}• ■
Smith, and Grossman have shown
great improvement during thj
season.
Thomson and Chadbourne are
both of them excellent runners and,
matched against Service, who holds
the Coast record, they should make
an interesting race in the half-mile.
This is Thomson's first year on the
track and Chad bourne's fourth.
California seems to have some
the better of it in the mile and two
mile, although Burton in bis event
has done some good work, reducing
his record every time he has gone
the eight laps.
Bell in the field events is an un
known quantity in that, with com
petition, he may even exceed any of
his previous records. With Ilen
ley out, the responsibility of win
ning the high jump and pole-vault
for the Cardinal rests on him. The
work of Cooley, Powell, and Wil
cox from California promises to
make the events close.
With Flaw in the ring, Berkeley
has an easy first in the hammer
throw, and likewise with Hussey in
the broad jump. The shot-put
may be close.
The entries were arranged yes
terday by Captain McCaughern
and Captain Hussey of California,
with the exception of the hurdles,
which will be drawn later.
