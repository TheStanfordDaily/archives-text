All the entries for the Intercol
legiate Track Meet next Saturday
are published today. The men
who will represent the opposing
universities have been chosen.
California will put forth what
seems to be one of the strongest
teams in its history, an aggrega
tion that is scheduled to compete
with the foremost college athletes
throughout the East. Stanford
will send out a team that is devel
oped largely this year from new
material, one that, through a suc
cession of misfortunes, has been
deprived of several of its experi
enced and promising men. Never
theless, the meet will be interesting
and, in many events, exciting. The
performance of the Stanford men
may surprise not only their rivals,
but also many of their fellow stu
dents who have not watched the
season's development. The team
is imbued with the Stanford spirit,
with the same determination that
was shown by the baseball men.
At the Freshman-Sophomore de
bate tomorrow evening we shall
have a final opportunity to give
the men a rousing send-off which
will inspire them with the feeling
that they have the enthusiastic
confidence and support of the stu
dent body.
