# PREPARE FOR CARNIVAL.
## Committees Are Getting Ready For Elizabethan Festival.—Make Several Suggestions. 
### 
The Elizabethan Carnival prom
ises to be the spectacular event
of the season. It will certainly be
a picture worth remembering, La
gunita aflame with lights, the
flowered barges, the may-pole
dance, the singing, the rustic tables
attended by sixthteenth century
serving maids, the out-door sports
and old-time feats of skill, and,
most important of all, the throngs
of people,from Queen Elizabeth and
the Earl of Leiscester down to the
clowns and hucksters.
The success of this last, however,
the committee says, depends alto
gether upon the cooperation of the
students. The elaborate plans of
those who are getting up the affair,
and even the enthusiastic help of
the faculty ladies,will avail naught
if the students do not do their part,
which is simply to appear in some
appropriate costume and have a
good time.
The costumes worn may rep
resent any period previous to six
teen hundred, which gives practi
cally unlimited range. Any costume
short of a Raglan coat or a shirt
waist will, according to the com
mittee, be appropriate. Little inge
nuity is required to transform a
twentieth centuryeveninij; gown into
a sixteenth century court dress. The
committee suggests that ruffs are
the distinctive feature of the Eliza
bethan garb, and that they may be
made of crepe paper or tarleton.
Mrs. Moran has offered to furnish
the men with theirs. The girls are
supposed to be able to manufacture
their own. The Elizabethan cap
has a dip in the middle and stands
out on the sides. This effect, it is
suggested, may be obtained by
combing the hair over side-pads.
Robin Hood costumes, shoulder
capes (these may be borrowed from
the girls), swords, ruffs, laces, and
feathers, clowns,or priests,costumes
—the men have as great a chance
as the girls. Mr. Dodge has sent
to Han Francisco for a number of
illustrated books on the subject,
which are now at the Library and
easily accessible to every one.
Every one at all interested in
getting up a costume is invited to
meet the committee (which includes
Mrs. Anderson, Mrs. Moran, Miss
Corker, and Miss Needles) at the
Theta House, Friday, April 18th,
at four o'clock.
