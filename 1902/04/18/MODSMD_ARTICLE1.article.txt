# WAS A GREAT SUCCESS.
## Presentation of "Antigone" Surpassed Expectations.â€”Criticism of Play. 
### 
Yesterday was one of the most
notable days in the history of the
University. It brought the cul
mination of many months of un
remitting labor, in the shape of a
performance of the utmost beauty
and interest, Sophocles' Antigone,
given with Mendelssohn's music,
placed upon the stage with careful
attention to all the facts of the
Greek theatre and drama that are
known to us, played by actors
worthy of the name, rendered, in
fine, as a Greek play never has
been rendered in America before,
if we may accept the unanimous
testimony of those who brought to
the performance of last evening
recollections of the Oedipus Ty
rannus as given at Harvard, the
Electra at Smith College, the
Antigone at Vassar and Swarth
more and Toronto.
The impression left upon every
person in the large audience that
filled the Assembly Hall was one
of great richness and beauty, and
great solemnity too. A glorious
and convincing demonstration had
been given of the surpassing loveli
ness and nobility and intelligence,
and artistic excellence that are the
unfailing marks of all things
Greek. The auditors understood
how the makers of the beautiful
translation which was used as a
libretto came to prefix to it, as a de
scriptive motto, lines that may be
rendered: "Not of today or of yes
terda}' is the life of these things,
but for all eternity." One thought,
too, of Thoreau's words: "Two
thousand summers have imparted
to the monuments of Grecian litera
ture, as to her marbles, only a
maturer golden and autumnal tint,
for they have carried their own
serene and celestial atmosphere into
all iands, to protect them against
the corrosion of time, works as re
fined, as solidly done; and as beau
tiful almost as the morning itself;
for later writers, say what we will
of their genius, have rarely, if ever,
equalled the elaborate beauty and
finish, and the lifelong and heroic
literary labors, of the ancients.
They only talk of forgetting them
who never knew them.''
The details of the performance
must be touched upon very briefly.
It is enough to say that the stage
pictures, the costumes with their
varied and lovely colors, and the
evolutions of the chorus, all ap
pealed very strongly to the eye;
that the music was very beautiful,
and was intensely enjoyed by the
audience; and that the acting on
the whole was so excellent that in
many passages it held the atten
tion even of those who had but the
slightest knowledge of the play.
The title role, Antigone, as played
by Miss Cooksey, was marked by
great beauty and dignity, and thor
ough appreciation both of Sopho
cles' purpose and of the Greek
nature and ideals. Professor Mur
ray's Creon was rendered with
great nobility and power, which
were sustained to the very end. It
was a remarkable piece of acting,
even when judged by the very

highest standards. The Ismene of
Miss Crandall was excellent. It is
a part that might easily seem color
less, but Miss Crandall gave it a
great interest and charm. Mr.
Seward's Tiresias, too, was very re
markable. Like Professor Mur
ray's Creon, it would bear the test
of the highest professional stand
ards, as many persons remarked
last evening.
The secondary parts, too, were
played well. Mr. J. K. Bonnell, as
the Guard, was very effective, and
succeeded in blending well the pe
culiar humor of the part and the
underlying seriousness. The Hae
rnon of Mr. R. V. Reppy was played
with great dignity, and with fine
appreciation of the restraint de
manded of Haemon in his desper
ate attempt to win over his father
by considerations of wisdom and
mercy. Mr. K. Rees, as the Mes
senger, played his part much in
the manner of the Guard, but yet
with an originality and force of his
own. And the Queen of Mrs. J. P.

Hall, although a brief part, was
yet acted so well that it is one of
the very pleasing memories of the
performance.
The Chorus, too, was extremely
satisfactory. Its work was a rev
elation, even to those who knew,
theoretically, something of the
great importance of this element of
the ancient drama. Its success was
owing principally to the scholar
ship and musical ability and inces
sant labor of Dr. Fairclough. Con
cerning the musical side of its
work a very appreciative criticism
from a competent hand will appear
in Monday's Palo Alto.
The costumes were to most a
great surprise. Few had realized
that, while being archaeologically
correct, they could at the same
time be so rich in color, and so
varied, and so richly blended. The
costuming was under the direction
of Mrs. Fairclough.
The curtain rose at half-past
eight. The opening scene, between
Antigone and Ismene, was beauti
fully rendered. The identification
of the actors with their parts was
perfect. Neither here nor else
where in the play was there any
suggestion, in the case of any char
acter, of mere declamation, with a
few very trifling exceptions. It
was acting, throughout. This is
one of several respects in which the
performance was somewhat super
ior to the Oedipus at Harvard.
The beautiful reading of the
Greek lines, too, was very notice
able in this scene, as later, in

Creon's part, and that of Tiresias,
and in the lyric positions of the
play. All the actors, indeed, per
formed remarkably well their diffi
cult task of preserving the word
accent while bringing out, through
careful observance of quantities,
the metrical scheme. There were
slips and exceptions, but they were
few.
It is impossible, in the limited
space that remains, to do more
than mention the scenes that were
of most especial interest and
beauty. One of these, certainly,
was that of Antigone's last appear
ance. Her mingled calmness, and
elevation, and longing for a touch
of human sympathy, were rendered
wonderfully. No one who saw that
scene will ever forget the experi
ence. The ancient drama has
been called cold. Restrained it is;
but anything so deeply moving as
this portion of the Antigone one
very rarely sees upon the stage.
In the case of Creon, each new
scene was a more vivid revelation

of his blindness and self-will. The
climax of his folly, in the scene
with Tiresias, the acting there of
Tiresias himself, the remorse and
despair of Creon later, all were
most impressive.
At the close the actors were re
called. Yet the applause, though
prolonged, was subdued. The im
pression was too deep for any very
ardent expression of appreciation.
The audience rose and left the place
with much the same feeling with
which the Greeks must have risen
from their seats on the slopes of
the Acroplis, as the chorus marched
from sight, lifting their eyes once
more to the familiar plains and the
purple ridge of Hymettus and
the shining sea, from the spot
where, during the long morn
ing hours, they had seen only An
tigone and Creon and the woes of
the house of Labdaous.
