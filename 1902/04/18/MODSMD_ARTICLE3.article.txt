# TRACK AND TENNIS.
## Men are Ready for the Contests Many Close Races Promised Tomorrow. 
### 
The track men have been doing
nothing but light work since Tues
day, and are now ready for the
contest tomorrow. By a compari
son of records made, it remains a
question as to who is likely to win
the sprints, the quarter, and the
half. Men in both universities
have made 10 1-5 in the hundred,
and well under 23 seconds in the
two-twenty. Thomson in the half
mile has come very close to the
two minute mark, and has never
been pushed nor run out at the fin
ish. But the Berkeley men have
done as well this season, and the
result can only be decided by the
race.
Bell, who may be unable to enter
because of sickness, has done 5:09|
in the high jump. Cooley and
Powell cleared that distance in the
Intercollegiate last year. In the
pole-vault Bell has never had to go
much over ten feet, and may sur
prise himself in competition.
There are a dozen other men who
may be depended upon for points
in the meet. Taylor and Nara
more in the hurdles; Hyde, Craw
ford, and Van Sickle in the weights;
Burton in the two-mile —and many
others.
The entries are as published in
the Daii-y Palo Alto last evening.
