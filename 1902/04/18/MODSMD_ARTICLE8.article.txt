All the work of training and
preparation for the Field Meet to
morrow is finished. Nothing more
remains to be done until the events
take place, beginning at two o'clock
in the afternoon. Emerging from
a season of unparalleled misfortune
in the loss of men who have won
points, Stanford will make the
greatest fight possible. In ad
dition to the incentive of their
own ambition and the knowl
edge that the student body is with
them, the men have the recent ex
ample of the baseball team for de
termination manifested when going
against great odds. The meet will
be made both interesting and ex
citing. There will be a large dele
gation of visitors from the Univer
sity of California. The Stanford
student body will probably turn
out en masse. As hosts of the day,
we must give the visitors a rousing
reception as well as a hard contest,
and at the concert in the evening
everybody can " jolly-up."
