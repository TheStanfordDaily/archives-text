# TRACK MEN MADE GOOD SHOWING.
## Results of Field-Day Gratifying to Stanford Supporters.— California, 78 I-2; Stanford, 43 I-2. McCaughern Smashed a Coast Record. 
### 
By the score of to Cali
fornia won from the Cardinal in
the annual Intercollegiate Field
day last Saturday. The score in
no way shows the satisfaction that
prevails among the Stanford track
men and sympathizers who, after
the large number of mishaps which
have weakened the team from time
to time, had expected 110 better
showing than was made last year,
32 to 85.
The exhibitions were many of
them excellent. A Coast record
was made in the two-twenty hur
dles, the two-twenty dash, and in
the shot-put; the Intercollegiate
hammer-throw record was broken,
the hundred-yard equaled, and In
tercollegiate records set for the first
time in the two-mile and relay.
The time in the two-mile was slow,
while that of the relay, 3:32 2-5,
was good.
Fully 2000 people witnessed the
events. The bleachers and the oval
for seventy-five yards on the edge
of the track were crowded with en
thusiastic supporters of the rival
teams.
The mile, to begin with, was a
surprise to the wearers of tbe Car
dinal, as three places had been con
ceded to the California men. Rede
well ran a good race and finished
strong, with Holman and (Jay of
Stanford second and third, and
Graves and Woods of California far
behind on the last lap.
The hundred went easily to the
Blue and Gold, realizing Califor
nia's expectations. Their chief in
terest in the race was over the con
test between Abadie and Cadogan
for first place.
The high hurdle heats failed to
qualify Naramore, watches held on
the seconds having shown Hanni
gan to be a faster man.
California started four men and
Stanford three in the quarter. The
race started with California in the
lead, boxing every Stanford runner
on the team. Smith found a hole
and broke through, then Dunn,
then Grossman. Each ran good,
heady races and finished in the
order named. Dunn sacrificed his
chances for first place in order to
help Grossman down the stretch.
As far as Stanford was concerned,
this race aroused the greatest en
thusiasm of the day.
The two-mile race was made
interesting by the jockeying
competition in which Stanford
got the best of it. Tibbets
was as far above 'Burton's
class as Burton was above the rest
of the contestants. Although the
time was slow, tbe possibilities in
Tibbetts were apparent; the last
lap showed tbe wonderful finish in
the man. Burton's performance
promises great things for next year.
Gundrum and McLaughlin sacri
ficed their chances for positions to
help Burton, their team-mate.
The half-mile was a pretty fight
between Service, the California vet
eran, and Thomson, one of "Dad"

Moulton's most promising develop
ments. Thomson lost principally
becausft of a lack of experience, but
he gave Service a close race and
Berkeley rooters a good many anx
ious moments. Chadbourne plugged
out a good third easily, outclassing
those behind him.
The low hurdle heats qualified
two California men, Powell and
Cheek, and one Stanford man, Tay
lor. The final was run by Taylor
in as good time as he had ever
made, but his record-smashing com
petitors left him in the rear and
finished in 25 3-5 seconds, lowering
a Coast record by two-fifths of a
second.
The two-twenty yielded three
places to the Cardinal. Coach
Christie of California overstepped
himself in meddling with the list
of entries and, as a result, Ca logan
and Abadie were thrown out of the
preliminaries, although Cadogan's
"break-down" in the hundred had
put him out of the event. Mc-
Caughern and Hamilton won over
Brown and Townshend, and no
California men qualified.
Following the two-twenty came
the relay, which among Eastern
institutions in every meet is tbe
event of the day. From the first
half of the first quarter when Dunn
strode away from the Berkeley
man, Srnilie, Stanford's lead was
never diminished. Watson, then
Dole, and finally Smith got the
signal for the last quarter. When
the latter broke the string, seventy
yards ahead of the last U. C. run
ner, the time, 3:32 2-5, showed an
average quarter of about 53 sec
onds.
First places in tbe field events
all went to Berkeley. Flaw made
an Intercollegiate record in tbe
hammer-throw, and a Coast record
in the shot-put. Second and third
in tbe hammer-throw and third in
the shot-put went easily to Califor
nia. Hyde pushed Flaw very close
for his place in the shot-put.
California won first easily in tbe
high jump, pole-vault, and broad
jump. The presence of Henley on
the field would have made consid
erable difference in each of these
events. Only a half-inch separated
the best jumps of Lyons and Top
ham, Topham leading. Whitaker
vaulted well, clearing 10 feet 4 inch
es, which was better than he bad
done this year. Hell had been ill for
some time and did not accomplish
as much as he would otherwise
have done.
Captain McCaughern ended tbe
meet by breaking the Coast record
for tbe two-twenty, running it in
22 fiat, three-fifths of a second fast
er than had before been done in
the West. Five watches at the
finish caught him in the same time.

the track is short, has no founda
tion, for it has been accurately
measured many times, one meas

help Grossman down the stretch.
As far as Stanford was concerned,
this race aroused the greatest en
thusiasm of the day.
The two-mile race was made
interesting by the jockeying
competition in which Stanford
got the best of it. Tibbets
was as far above 'Burton's
class as Burton was above the rest
of the contestants. Although the
time was slow, tbe possibilities in
Tibbetts were apparent; the last
lap showed tbe wonderful finish in
the man. Burton's performance
promises great things for next year.
Gundrum and McLaughlin sacri
ficed their chances for positions to
help Burton, their team-mate.
The half-mile was a pretty fight
between Service, the California vet
eran, and Thomson, one of "Dad"

Moulton's most promising develop
ments. Thomson lost principally
becausft of a lack of experience, but
he gave Service a close race and
Berkeley rooters a good many anx
ious moments. Chadbourne plugged
out a good third easily, outclassing
those behind him.
The low hurdle heats qualified
two California men, Powell and
Cheek, and one Stanford man, Tay
lor. The final was run by Taylor
in as good time as he had ever
made, but his record-smashing com
petitors left him in the rear and
finished in 25 3-5 seconds, lowering
a Coast record by two-fifths of a
second.
The two-twenty yielded three
places to the Cardinal. Coach
Christie of California overstepped
himself in meddling with the list
of entries and, as a result, Ca logan
and Abadie were thrown out of the
preliminaries, although Cadogan's
"break-down" in the hundred had
put him out of the event. Mc-
Caughern and Hamilton won over
Brown and Townshend, and no
California men qualified.
Following the two-twenty came
the relay, which among Eastern
institutions in every meet is tbe
event of the day. From the first
half of the first quarter when Dunn
strode away from the Berkeley
man, Srnilie, Stanford's lead was
never diminished. Watson, then
Dole, and finally Smith got the
signal for the last quarter. When
the latter broke the string, seventy
yards ahead of the last U. C. run
ner, the time, 3:32 2-5, showed an
average quarter of about 53 sec
onds.
First places in tbe field events
all went to Berkeley. Flaw made
an Intercollegiate record in tbe
hammer-throw, and a Coast record
in the shot-put. Second and third
in tbe hammer-throw and third in
the shot-put went easily to Califor
nia. Hyde pushed Flaw very close
for his place in the shot-put.
California won first easily in tbe
high jump, pole-vault, and broad
jump. The presence of Henley on
the field would have made consid
erable difference in each of these
events. Only a half-inch separated
the best jumps of Lyons and Top
ham, Topham leading. Whitaker
vaulted well, clearing 10 feet 4 inch
es, which was better than he bad
done this year. Hell had been ill for
some time and did not accomplish
as much as he would otherwise
have done.
Captain McCaughern ended tbe
meet by breaking the Coast record
for tbe two-twenty, running it in
22 fiat, three-fifths of a second fast
er than had before been done in
the West. Five watches at the
finish caught him in the same time.
The Examiner's insinuation that

yards. 3:32 2-5.
By the score of to Cali
fornia won from the Cardinal in
the annual Intercollegiate Field
day last Saturday. The score in
no way shows the satisfaction that
prevails among the Stanford track
men and sympathizers who, after
the large number of mishaps which
have weakened the team from time
to time, had expected 110 better
showing than was made last year,
32 to 85.
The exhibitions were many of
them excellent. A Coast record
was made in the two-twenty hur
dles, the two-twenty dash, and in
the shot-put; the Intercollegiate
hammer-throw record was broken,
the hundred-yard equaled, and In
tercollegiate records set for the first
time in the two-mile and relay.
The time in the two-mile was slow,
while that of the relay, 3:32 2-5,
was good.
Fully 2000 people witnessed the
events. The bleachers and the oval
for seventy-five yards on the edge
of the track were crowded with en
thusiastic supporters of the rival
teams.
The mile, to begin with, was a
surprise to the wearers of tbe Car
dinal, as three places had been con
ceded to the California men. Rede
well ran a good race and finished
strong, with Holman and (Jay of
Stanford second and third, and
Graves and Woods of California far
behind on the last lap.
The hundred went easily to the
Blue and Gold, realizing Califor
nia's expectations. Their chief in
terest in the race was over the con
test between Abadie and Cadogan
for first place.
The high hurdle heats failed to
qualify Naramore, watches held on
the seconds having shown Hanni
gan to be a faster man.
California started four men and
Stanford three in the quarter. The
race started with California in the
lead, boxing every Stanford runner
on the team. Smith found a hole
and broke through, then Dunn,
then Grossman. Each ran good,
heady races and finished in the
order named. Dunn sacrificed his
chances for first place in order to
help Grossman down the stretch.

yards ahead of the last U. C. run
ner, the time, 3:32 2-5, showed an
average quarter of about 53 sec
onds.
First places in tbe field events
all went to Berkeley. Flaw made
an Intercollegiate record in tbe
hammer-throw, and a Coast record
in the shot-put. Second and third
in tbe hammer-throw and third in
the shot-put went easily to Califor
nia. Hyde pushed Flaw very close
for his place in the shot-put.
California won first easily in tbe
high jump, pole-vault, and broad
jump. The presence of Henley on
the field would have made consid
erable difference in each of these
events. Only a half-inch separated
the best jumps of Lyons and Top
ham, Topham leading. Whitaker
vaulted well, clearing 10 feet 4 inch
es, which was better than he bad
done this year. Hell had been ill for
some time and did not accomplish
as much as he would otherwise
have done.
Captain McCaughern ended tbe
meet by breaking the Coast record
for tbe two-twenty, running it in
22 fiat, three-fifths of a second fast
er than had before been done in
the West. Five watches at the
finish caught him in the same time.
The Examiner's insinuation that
the track is short, has no founda
tion, for it has been accurately
measured many times, one meas
urement having been taken just
befor? 'he Field-day.
