## The
						Antigone Company Does Not Leave Tomorrow.â€”Saturday Performance a Success. 
### 
A dispatch makes it necessary to
postpone the immediate departure
of the Antigone Company for the
South. Announcement will he
made on the bulletin-hoard as soon
as arrangements are completed.
A tentative list of those in the
the supplementary chorus who will
make the trip is composed of the
following names: Anderson, Atkin
son, Burton, Hawley, Hosmer, Jef
fers, E. A. Jones, G. P. Jones, 0.
Kehrlein, J. S. King, A. J. Klamt,
T. McCaugliern, Park, Pleak, liea,
Taylor, Tucker, F. P. Whitaker.
A meeting of those connected
with the Antigone was held in the
Assembly Hall this afternoon at
1:15. Dr. Murray spoke before the
men, thanking them for their en
thusiastic support and the hard
work they had put on the play.

The second performance of the
play on Saturday was even finer
than the first. Actors and chorus
were at their very beet. There was
a large audience. One hundred
and fifty persons came from Berke
ley, and large delegations from San
Francisco, San Jose, and Santa
Clara.
Those who had attended the first
performance gained at this second
presentation, as they saw the play
with familiar eyes and were able to
regard it as a whole, a new impres
sion of its power as an acting
drama, well suited for the stage
today, if only the veil that a
strange language interposes could
be brushed aside. One gained, too,
a new understanding of the excel
lence with which certain individual
parts were played. The Second
Messenger of Mr. Thomas was seen
to be very good, overlooked at first
only because of its brevity. One
realized more clearly than before
the difficulty of the part of Euryd
ice, and the power and beauty with
which it was played, and the per
fection with which the Greek lines
were rendered. And the chorus,
too, seemed even better than on
Thursday. The great Bacchic song
of rejoicing was given magnifi
cently, and the dancing of the
Coryphaeus and chorus was re
markably graceful and dignified
and rhythmical. There was noth
ing more perfect in the play.
Concerning the musical side of
the Antigone performance, Mr.
John Pleasants, organist and
choirmaster of Christ church, East
Orange, New Jersey, who was [ires
en t said:
"Had the chorus in last night's
performance of the Antigone been
a professional one, it would not
have been excessive praise to say
that its effect was unusually good.
When it is taken into consideration
that the chorus was composed of
amateurs, and not even regularly
organized amateurs, it is scant
praise to say that its effect was un
expectedly fine. The first tenors
were weak in comparison with the
other parts, and sounded somewhat
straine'd toward the end of the
play, but this weakness existed
only in the same proportion that it
does in the best professional male
choruses, and is due to the scarcity
of tenor voices. The fidelity to
pitch and excellence of attack were
all that could he desired, and al
though the chorus was practically
in three different places the of

fences against precision were triv
ial. In the "Hymn to Bacchus"
the effect was magnificently sonor
ous. Great credit is due Professor
Fairclough for his skill and un
wearying patience in reproducing
the atmosphere which Mendelssohn
has so successfully created under
the inspiration of this great Greek
masterpiece. And mention must
also he made of Mr. Arthur Scott
Brook's able conducting, which
greatly enhanced the success of the
performance."
