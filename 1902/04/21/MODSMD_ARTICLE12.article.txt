The combined concert of the Cal
ifornia and Stanford musical clubs,
given in the Assembly Hall on Sat
urday evening after the Intercol
legiate Field-day, was well attended
and proved a very great success.
To a slight degree California sur
passed us with her Glee Club under
the leadership of "Brick" Morse,
but Stanford's Mandolin Club was
much the better. The program
combined numbers by California's
Glee and Mandolin Club, but the
Banjo Club did not appear as had
been announced because some of
the players did not come up from
Berkeley. Berkeley was also repre
sented by an excellent male quar
tette, and by Ike Karmel, the
humorous monologuist,who claimed
to be the author of the Bogie. A.
W. Black, U. C., gave a very clever
banjo solo. Aside from the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs Stanford was
ably represented by C. L. Fire
baugh, '04, and Roy M. Smith, ex
'o3, both soloists of remarkable
power and possessed of well de
veloped voices. Waldemar Young,
Stanford '04, recited "Casey at the
Bat" in a heart-breaking De Wolf
Hopperian manner. The program
was varied enough to be interesting
all the time, though the numerous
recalls tended to make the concert
rather long. As usual with both
glee clubs were happier in their
singing of popular or college songs
than in the rendering of classical
music. The fact that the clubs of
both universities could make such
a creditable showing on such short
notice shows well for their past
training and work.
