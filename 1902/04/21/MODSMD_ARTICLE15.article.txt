Henley lias been a prominent
figure in Coast athletics for a num
ber of years. In 1900 he won the
championship of the Academic
League in the pole-vault at 10 feet
7 inches; in the high jump at 6
feet 1 inch; and in the broad
jump at 22 feet inches. He
won points in all three events in

kept him out of this year's Inter
collegiate Saturday. Henley is a
