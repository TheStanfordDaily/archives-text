# "Quad" Will Cost $2.
## 
### 
The Junior Class, at a meeting
this afternoon, voted to fix the
price of the 1903 Quad at $2, ex
cept for members of the class who,
upon presenting a receipt showing
that they have paid their assess
ment, may secure the book for $1.50.
Editor Renaud explained that the
cuts are being made in the East,
and that the annual will be larger
than usual, containing a number of
expensive features, including a
large facsimile of the Stanford
deed, and, perhaps, color repro
ductions of some of the church
windows. These undertakings call
for additional expense, making an
advance in the price necessary. The
request met objections upon the
ground that the expense, including
the assessment, is already a burden
on many students, and that it is in
advisable to increase the cost. The
motion to raise the price carried as
above stated.
