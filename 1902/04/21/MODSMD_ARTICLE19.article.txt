# Strength Tests in College.
## 
### 
According to an Associated Press
report "College men throughout the
United States have begun to take
strength tests for the purpose of as
certaining the institution which
numbers within its ranks the fifty
strongest men among the American
colleges. This competition is unique
in intercollegiate rivalry, as the
athletes do not meet in an actual
contest of strength. Each univer
sity sends to the committee the sta
tistical records of its fifty strongest
men, and to colleges who√üe athletes
make the highest total is awarded
the intercollegiate championship.
"The tests by which the strength
of men is measured were devised
by Dr. Dudley A. Sargent of Har
vard. There are seven tests which
respectively record the strength of
the back, the legs, the right grip, the
left grip, ability to "dip," to "push
up," and to pull up, and finally the
strength of the lungs.
"At present Columbia holds the
championship, and expects to in
crease the total of 65,000 points
made by her fifty men last year."
