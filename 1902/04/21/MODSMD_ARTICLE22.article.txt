# SOPHOMORES WON DEBATE.
## Judges Gave Unanimous Decision for '04.â€”Good Work by the Freshmen. 
### 
The fourth annual Freshman-
Sophomore debate was awarded on
Friday night to the Sophomores by
a unanimous decision of the judges.
The contest, however, was close,
and the speakers on both sides did
excellently. It was the more ma
ture method of handling the sub
ject that won the debate for the
representatives of the Sophomore
class. The work of Dibble and
Sheriffs for the Freshmen was
good, that of the former being note
worthy for his treatment of the
subject, and that of the hitter es
pecially for his delivery. Benja
min C. Dey, '05, could not take
part on account of illness, and his
speech was read by the alternate,
\V. L. Blair. For the Sophomores,
Lewis and Jones both had good
presence and treated the question
in a deliberate and forceable man
ner.
This victory makes the second
one for the Class of 1904, and each
time with a different team. Out of
the four interclass debates that
have been held, two have been won
by Freshman and two by Sopho
more teams. In the first, '01 de
feated '02; in the second '03 de
feated '02; and last year '04 won
from '03.
The attendance Friday evening
was comparatively large and a
great deal of enthusiasm was shown
before and after the debate, as well
as between the speeches, by the rival
factions of the Sophomores and
Freshmen. The judges were Pro
fessors Green, Whittier, and Alden.
E. W. Rice, '02, was chairman, and
R. H. Kimball,'o3, acted as time
keeper. The question debated was
"Resolved, That the United States
should resist by force, if need be,
any further colonization of South
America by Europe." The Fresh
men supported the affirmative, and
the Sophomores the negative.
