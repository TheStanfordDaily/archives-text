Professor George M. Stratton of
the University of California
preached in the chapel yesterday
morning on the "Problems of
Evil," as discussed by John Fiske,
He said in part: "Evil is so sur
rounded by mystery that it is a
hard subject to speak about. John
Fiske holds that the solution of
evil comes through the doctrine of
evolution and psychology; that our

minds obey the laws of contrast,
and unless we do evil the good we
perform will be mechanical, having
no virtue; and that in evolution
evil is indispensable, present in all
the transition steps. Fiske is right
in the main, but the theory that
evil is a necessity is dangerous.
There are cases where perfect con
ditions of life have been seen. To
day we allow evil to subdue us be
cause we weakly fall a victim to
this theory and submit to it. We
must constantly work to destroy
this theory if we wish to elevate
the condition of the world."
