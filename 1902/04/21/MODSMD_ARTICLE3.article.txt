# FOUGHT HARD, BUT LOST.
## Stanford's Tennis Men Defeated by Those From University of California. 
### 
Stanford was unable to get a set
out of the intercollegiate tennis on
Saturday, although her men fought
hard against the odds before them.
The lesson of the meet to Stanford
onlookers was the utter hopeless
ness of competition while Stanford
players are handicapped by the
lack of courts for practice. In
strokes and fighting qualities Stan
ford equalled her clever opponents,
but lost because of the superior
steadiness of the latter, a result of
long practice on good courts.
Reuben Hunt, the veteran of the
California team, put up a superb
game against Harry Weihe, whom
lie foiled time and again when
Weihe played the net by careful
and well placed strokes and drives.
Weihe worked hard to the last,
giving his opponent credit for every
good play. The score was 6-1,
6-2.
Cleveland Baker started out in
great style and fought every point
to the end of the second set, which
McGavin won, 6-3, the same score
as the first set. McGavin clearly
outclassed Baker in steadiness.
By the loss of both singles Stan
ford lost the meet for the year.
The doubles were played by Hunt
and Baker for California, and by
Weihe and Frank Leib for Stan
ford. The representatives for the
Blue and Gold won out easily, 6-2,
6-3. The Stanford men put up an
excellent game in many respects,
and their strokes, Leib's especially,
were often cheered by the specta
tors, who were throughout the meet
thoroughly impartial in their ap
plause. As in the singles, the su
perior steadiness of the Berkeley
players left little in doubt except
the score.
