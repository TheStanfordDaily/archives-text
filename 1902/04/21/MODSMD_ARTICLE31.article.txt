### 
The cases against students
charged with disturbing the peace
on the night of the Uncle Tom's
Cabin show in Palo Alto were
tried before Justice Charles this
afternoon. T. M. Coen, defendant
in the first action, was found guilty
and his penalty will be pronounced
tomorrow. The prosecution showed
that Coen was one of the company
that created a disturbance at the
show, while the defense attempted
to prove that the prosecution did
not establish the fact that Coen was
actually implicated. The prosecu
ting witnesses were Messrs.La Peire,
Parkinson, and Curry, of Palo
Alto. The attorneys for the defense
were T. McFadden, '00, and M. C.
I)e Carli, '00.
F. E.Nangle, who pleaded his own
case, was acquitted. M. J. New
berg will have a trial tomorrow.
