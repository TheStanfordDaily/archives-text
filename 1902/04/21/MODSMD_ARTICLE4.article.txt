# Card from Mr. Moulton.
## 
### 
I would like to thank the mem
bers of the track team one and all
for their good showing, game work,
and for their manly principles in
keeping training rules. I would
also like them to remember that
when I told them they had a chance
to win it was the truth, taking into
consider*)lion the records made.
Henley should have won 13, if not
15; Nichols 8; Kuhn 1, if not 3;
and Sprague 5, and a chance at 10.
Now that would have landed us
minus 20. However, all hope is
not lost. Let us all start in with
the determination to do still better
next season.
Thanking the captain, manager,
and student body for their hearty
support and the confidence they
place in me, I am
Yours to command,
E. W. Moulton.
