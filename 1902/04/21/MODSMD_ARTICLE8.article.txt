Nothing but encouragement and
delight is felt by Stanford people
over the result of the Field-day.
They have no hard luck stories to
give, except those already known to
the public on account of the loss of
men. With corresponding growth
they hope in another year to defeat
California athletes. The determina
tion, the spirit, the confidence in
Moulton is increasing. Ten out of
seventeen S's won Saturday were
made by new men, who have been
brought out by hard work during
the season. Already other men are
signifying their intention of going
on the track next year. Under Mc-
Caughern the team has been
handled as it should have been.
Too much credit cannot be given
the gritty little captain for his
stand in regard to training rules,
and for the hard work he has done,
and the ability he has exercised in
managing the team. His re-elec
tion is a logical necessity to con
tinue the improvement. With one
more season, such as the present
has been, Stanford will send out an
invincible aggregation of record
breakers.
