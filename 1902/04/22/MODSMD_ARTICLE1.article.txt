# M'CAUGHERN RE-ELECTED.
## Will Direct the Fortunes of the Track Team for Another Season. 
### 
By a unanimous vote, the track
men late this afternoon re-elected
J. C. McCaughern to direct the
fortunes of the team for another
year. The general feeling was that
the success of the present season
has been due in large measure to
the efforts of McCaughern, in con
nection with the work of Trainer
Moulton, whom he was instrumen
tal in bringing to Stanford. This
re-election is the first instance of
the kind in the history of local ath
letics, and is considered a well
earned tribute to the work of the
captain.
McCaughern entered Stanford in
January of 1900, having spent the
previous year at Dartmouth Col
lege, Me., where he played half
back on his freshman football team.
During his lirst semester here he
ran in the Intercollegiate Field
Meet, beating both Drum and Cad
ogan in the hundred. He spent
the fall semester of 1900 at Notre
Dame, Indiana, where he made the
acquaintance of "Dad" Moulton.
The second semester of last year
he returned to Stanford. In the
Interclass Field Meet he broke
a muscle of his leg, which disabled
him so that he was unable to finish
in his events at the Intercollegiate.
At the close of the season
he was chosen for the position to
which he has again been elected.
In an exhibition sprint at the
close of the events last Saturday
McCaughern ran the two-twenty in
0:22, lowering the Coast record by
three-fifths of a second. At the
Occidental meet April sth he made
the hundred in 0:10 on a track that
was a few inches short. His record
in the quarter is 0:51 2-5, in the
broad jump 21 feet 7 inches, and in
the hundred 0:10 1-5.
