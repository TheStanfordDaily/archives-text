The concert given by the Girls'
Glee and Mandolin Clubs at Los
Gatos last Friday evening was an
unqualified success, both from the
standpoint of the audience and
from that of the performers, who
enjoyed the trip. In addition to
the numbers by the clubs them
selves, Mrs. W. H. Irwin, '98, as
sisted with pantomime impersona
tions and recitations, giving Mr.
Irwin's "Baseball Game" and
Browning's "Confession." Her num
bers were received with marked en
thusiasm. Among the specialties
were whistling by Miss Bean, '04,
violin solo by Miss Bruckman, '04,
and a banjo solo by Miss May Kim
ball, '02.
