No moke outside meets will be
held this semester, and the athletic
season practicially came to a close
with the Intercollegiate Field-day.
For good steady work and solid de
velopment Stanford has never be
fore done so well on the track, and
built so firmly for the future. The
remaining contests of the year are
in the field of debating. Next Sat
urday evening the Intercollegiate
team will argue against the speak
ers from the University of Califor
nia in the annual debate. On Fri
day, Way 3d, three men from the
University of Washington will meet
three of our representatives in tlie
first interstate debating contest of
Stanford's history. While this
phase of activity is not so popular
as athletics, and only the results of
long training are evident in the
final speeches, these contests are
almost as important in the cata
logue of intercollegiate events as
any of the athletic meets this
spring. A large crowd will be able
to go to the city next Saturday
night. The entire student body
should attend the Washington de
bate here. We have won the Oar
not. The teams are making every
effort to win the remaining debates.
Let us give assurance that we are
with them.
