# The
						Alumni Smoker.
## 
### 
The Stanford Club of San Fran
cisco, under the new presidency of
Dr. Harry B. Reynolds, says the
Chronicle, gave a successful smoker
and jinks last night in the banquet
hall of Pythian Castle, and for a
special feature had a boxing con
test by two colored unknowns.
More than sixty former Stanford
students were present. Tobacco
and pipes, beer and sandwiches
and crackers and cheese lilled in
the time between various songs,
stories, and yells. A collection
was taken up, to be sent to the
Stanford men at Honolulu, with
instructions to get some beautiful
flowers to be presented to Mrs.
Stanford in Honolulu on May 14th,
the anniversary of the birth of
Leland Stanford, Jr.
