George Harvey comments editor
ially in the current Harper's Weekly
as follows: "The choice of Rev. li.
Heber Newton to be preacher at
Leland Stanford Junior University,
and his acceptance of the place, in
volving, as it does, the leaving of
his church and parish in the
Metropolis, and his going to Cali
fornia to reside, call attention to
the important place which our
larger universities are coming to
have in the religious life of the
country through their deliberate
service for young men along religi
ous lines. . If Dr. New
ton's health permits him to take up
the work at Stanford University to
which he has been called it will
mean much to the Pacific Coast,
which needs more men of his keen,
ethical sensitiveness and radical
ism. The world and the fiesh have
not had very many doughty com
batants in the clergy of the Pacific
Coast. Starr King in the early
days, Stebbins and McLean in the
generation just passing off the
scenes, and Brown and Adams of
the present generation, have done
and are doing fine work. Hut a
new day has dawned with the sud
den development of great universi
ties at Palo Alto and Berkeley."
