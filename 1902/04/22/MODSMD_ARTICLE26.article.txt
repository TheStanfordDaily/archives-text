Rev. YV. Martin, University of
California, '00, addressed the
Christian Associations meeting
Sunday evening, with a brief talk
on the essence of Christianity.
He said in substance: "Christian
ity is not sentimental, or emotion
al Neither is it a church, phil
anthropy, or a creed, although the
latter is almost essential. A Chris
tian life is the indwelling spirit of
Christ, the essential of Christian
ity. The love of Christ manifests
itself in righteousness and in ser
vice, and there are innumerable
ways in which we can serve. To
whom much is given, of him much
will be required. If we have the
spirit of Christ dwelling within us
we can take the world for God.''
