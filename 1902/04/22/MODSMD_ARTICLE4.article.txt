# MORE EXHIBITS.
## Art Collections in Museum Rearranged. â€”Many Things Added. 
### 
During the last few weeks a great
many changes and additions have
been made in the Museum. Cura
tor Peterson has, with great taste
and skill, been rearranging the Art
Galleries, and putting up cases
filled with the articles lately brought
from Europe by Mrs. Stanford.
The upper floor of the north wing
is now almost entirely devoted to
original paintings, while all the
copies will be hung in the big upper
room of the south wing. The two
large studies of the days of '49, by
Charles Nahl, have been hung in
the corridor, one on each side, and
are thus displayed to a greater ad
vantage than they were when in
the south gallery. Over a score of
pieces by well-known German art
ists have been unpacked and hung.
These pieces, mostly landscapes,
are by Bredlow,G. Schmitz, J. Jung
blut, Schinert, Zatzka, and Marce
glia. Pio liicci's "XVI Costume,"
with its rich and realistic coloring,
Fr. Chwala's "Moonlight on the
Danube," and Mazzoni's "Slave,"
an excellent and subtle study which
arrived last May, are exhibited for
the first time.
One of the upper rooms of the
south annex will be filled with pic
tures, paintings, and mementos
of the University and Stock Farm.
Several dozen well framed pictures
of Palo Alto horses, as yet unclassi
fied, have been put up, and many
more are expected. Awards, certi
ficates, and ribbons will also be put
on exhibition. On Saturday the
skeleton of the famous stallion
Palo Alto was brought from San
Francisco and putin this room.
The skeletons of Electioneer and
Occident, with the sulky in which
four world's records were broken,
will shortly be moved from the
south end of the building to the
annex. A large photograph, 18 by
24 inches, of the "Palo Alto Trees"
taken in 1877 by Watkins, is one
of the many interesting illustra
tions in the collection.
The Ford collection of mission
pictures from Pasadena, made
twenty-five years ago, recently
bought by Mrs. Stanford, have
been placed in the north annex.
In the lower annex a great many
new cases have been filled and put
in position, though not as yet
thoroughly labeled. One of these
cases contains a complete collec
tion of rare ancient Roman lamps
from Corneto, Italy. A dozen
sculptured marble heads from
Astia, Italy, and a number of has
reliefs from the Appian Way, Rome,
occupy two other cases; while coins,
keys, bowls, carved lava from Pom
peii, and inlaid boxes from Sor
rento, are in another. A case of
Modern Venetian fans, embroidery,
chests, baskets, and rosaries is one
of the prettiest.
A number of articles were putin
the Stanford room by Mrs. Stan
ford recently. Among these is an
afgan made by Mrs. James Covert
of Albany, N. Y., and presented to
Mrs. Stanford in 1886. Souvenir
postal cards collected at every place
visited on her last European tour

have been putin one of the south
cases. An interesting case filled
with mementos of Henry Lathrop
has a collection of valuable pipes,
mostly meerchaum, and coins.
The trowel with which the cor
ner-stone of the Memorial Church
was laid, January 29, 1900, has re
cently been putin the Stanford
room.
