M.J. Nevvberg was this afternoon
acquitted from the charge of dis
turbing the peace the night of the
Uncle Tom's Cabin show in Palo
Alto. The attorney for the defend
ant, Plowhead, showed that but two
of the witnesses on the prosecution,
Professor Sanford and Mr. Parkin
son, testified that Newberg had
made loud and unusual noises. On
the contrary, all witnesses for the
defendant stated that Newberg,
while in their company, made no
noise.
In summing up the case Judge
Charles stated that the testimony
of the prosecution showed that
Newberg was guilty of making
some noise, but it was done without
malice, and there were others just
as guilty in the crowd.
Coen will be given a rehearing
tomorrow.
