### 
Dr. J. C. Merriam, professor of
paleontology at the University of
California, addressed the students
of the Geology department in a
meeting held under the auspices of
the Geological Society last Friday
night.
Dr. Merriam described the beds
of volcanic ash and alluvium in
the central part of Oregon, which
are known as the JJohn Day beds.
These beds extend from the upper
Eocene into the Pliocene, and con
tain remains of the saber-toothed
tiger, three-toed horse, two-horned
rhinoceros, and other extinct mam
mals which lived and flourished at
that time. The lecturer illustrated
his remarks with lantern slides
showing the topography and geol
ogy of that section, and also the
fossil bones found in the beds, and
restorations of the animals.
At the conclusion of the lecture
the members of the society ad
journed to the Delta Upsilon house,
where a reception was held in Dr.
Merriam's honor.
