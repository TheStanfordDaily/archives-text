R. S. Fisher, '02, raised the ques
tion as to whether it was constitu
tional for J. A. Quelle, who was re
nominated for business manager of
I lie Daily Palo Alto, to run for
the office, since he is not a member
of the student body. Nothing was
found in the constitution prohibit
ing him so doing. C. A. Cantwell
explained Mr. Quelle's position
briefly, saying that when the Ex
ecutive Committee placed him in
the position the step was a neces
sity, the paper having been left
financially demoralized by previ
ous managers. Advertisements
were running at various rates; sys
tem was lacking, and business men
had little faith in the paper. Mr.

Quelle agreed to assume the man
agement, to pay the editor $2 an
issue, and to divide all profits over
$100 a month with the student
body. He has spent the year, the
speaker said, in getting the paper
on a sound basis, and has made
nothing himself. Now some one
steps in to reap the profits. It was
understood that he should be reap
pointed this year. Cantwell said
it is for the interests of the Daily
that faith lie kept with him.
In reply Fisher argued that if
any one is to make money out of
the paper a student ought to be the
one to do so. His motion to drop
the name of J. A. Quelle from the
list of nominees, after being declared
out of order, was withdrawn before
being appealed to the house.
