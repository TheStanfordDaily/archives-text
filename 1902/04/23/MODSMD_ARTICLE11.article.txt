It hits been the unbroken policy
of the Daily Palo Alto to refrain
from expressing any opinion in the
matter of a contested student body
election. Now, however, a case has
arisen in which are concerned both
the welfare of this paper and the
faith of the student body, ho that a
statement of the facts in the case
seems necessary.
As was clearly explained by the
former secretary of the student
body at the public meeting this
afternoon, J. A. Quelle, manager
of the University Press, assumed
the business management of the
Daily Palo Alto at the close of
last spring because no one else
could be found who would take it.
At that time the business was <'e
moralized: the manager had been
changed three times during the
year: discrimination had been
made between different advertisers,
rates had been varied, and the insti
tution had no business standing
whatsoever. Mr. Quelle, who came
to Stanford when the University
was opened, and who has printed
the paper, with the exception of a
period of a little more than two
months, since its establishment in
1892, stepped into the breach and
offered to take the management
this year, provided the committee
would, if the arrangement worked
satisfactorily, endeavor to have the
contract continued for another
year. In assuming the manage
ment be did so under the provision
of the constitution which declares
that the editor and business man
ager shall share equally the profits
of the publication up to $100 per
month, above which the surplus
shall be divided with the student
body. Furthermore, he guaran
teed the editor two dollars per issue.

So clear was the understanding
that Mr. Quelle was to have the |
position for two years, that not
even those connected with the
paper realized, until within the last
few days, that there was any clanger
of the plan being overthrown. Tak
ing up the business when it was so
disturbed that a student could not
be found to undertake the responsi
bility, the new manager reorganized
it. He establised uniform adver
tising rates, refused to make any
discrimination, and adhered to
strict business principles. By
this means he has placed the
concern in such a posi
tion that it commands the
confidence of business men. At a
financial sacrifice to himself, in
view of the conditions when he
took up the proposition, he has
paid more to the students —editors,
advertising solicitors, and collect
ors —than lias been made in recent
years by business managers and
editors. Furthermore, owing to
the greater space to till because no
"fake" advertisements were used, it
has been necessary to set more type
on the paper eacb day; u portion
of this lias been done by student
labor.
Several times the existence of
the Daily lias been threatened be
cause its business was so poorly
handled. Last year an agitation
was started to place it in the hands
of a stock company, removing it
from student politics, as is the case
with the notably successful college
dailies in the country. It did not
seem then that any other means
could revive it. But under the
present arrangement more issues
have been published and more news
printed than ever before, and the
business has been run satisfactorily.
