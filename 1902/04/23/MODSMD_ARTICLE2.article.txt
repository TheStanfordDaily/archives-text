### 
Edmund R. Lyman, '90, who
spent last semester here doing ad
vanced work in Chemistry, and
who was formerly director of the
Chinese Polytechnical Institute in
Shanghai, is at present at Shang
hai in charge of the translation of
scientific text-books into Chinese.
These translations are being made
primarily for the College of West
ern Science at Tai-Yuenfue, the
capital of Shansi Province. This
college, the most important educa
tional project in China, is endowed
by the indemnity exacted for the
destruction of missions in that
province. The ten yearly install
ments of $35,000 are being paid to
Mr. Richards, who is organizing
the college.
The importance of Mr. Lyman's
work cannot be over-estimated, for
this is the first attempt at translat
ing scientific books into the Chinese
language. Heretofore the teaching
of the sciences at the Imperial uni
versities has been hampered be
cause students were obliged to
learn German and English.
