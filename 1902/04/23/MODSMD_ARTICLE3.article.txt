Editor Daily Pai.o Alto:
In order to prevent any mis
understanding in regard to the fact
than I am not a candidate for the
office of student body treasurer, I
wish to say that I handed my name
to Professor Green, at his request,
over a month ago in order that the
committee might consider my ac
ceptability, and I applied to him
about a week ago for an answer,
but was told that they were not
ready to report, and that I would
be notified.
About two hour# before the.nom
inations I was told that I was not
acceptable. 1 wish it to lie dis
tinctly understood that my with
drawal at the eleventh hour was
not voluntary, but by compulsion
of the faculty for reasons which
they deem sufficient.
