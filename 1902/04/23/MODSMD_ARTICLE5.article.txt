Although this semester's inter
collegiate contests are to show in
the Treasurer's report for April, it
might be well at this stage to make
a rough estimate of the condition
of student body finances.
When college opened last Sep
tember the Treasurer's books
showed a deficit of about $1,000.
Stanford's share in the Intercol
legiate football game November
9th was $3000 net less than the
Thanksgiving Day game a year
previous. The expense of coaches
was the same, while the fact that
the season was two weeks shorter
this year, cut down the expense
some.

Two steps were tiilcen which
aided materially, and which did
much to put the student body on a
firm basis for this semester. The
first was the buying out of the
Grand Opera House the night of
November 9th, from which we real
ized $500; the second was the trip
the football team made to Los An
geles Thanksgiving Day, which net
ted .$l,OOO.
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
have been a source of revenue this
year. They have made up their
deficit and have added no less than
•$2OO to the general fund. As in
former years, we have lost money
in track and baseball.
In spite of the decreased gate re
ceipts November 9th, indications
point to a more successful year
financially than last. I look to see
last year's deficit reduced at the
end of this semester to $400.

Although this semester's inter
collegiate contests are to show in
the Treasurer's report for April, it
might be well at this stage to make
a rough estimate of the condition
of student body finances.
When college opened last Sep
tember the Treasurer's books
showed a deficit of about $1,000.
Stanford's share in the Intercol
legiate football game November
9th was $3000 net less than the
Thanksgiving Day game a year
previous. The expense of coaches
was the same, while the fact that
the season was two weeks shorter
this year, cut down the expense
some.

Two steps were tiilcen which
aided materially, and which did
much to put the student body on a
firm basis for this semester. The
first was the buying out of the
Grand Opera House the night of
November 9th, from which we real
ized $500; the second was the trip
the football team made to Los An
geles Thanksgiving Day, which net
ted .$l,OOO.
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
have been a source of revenue this
year. They have made up their
deficit and have added no less than
•$2OO to the general fund. As in
former years, we have lost money
in track and baseball.
In spite of the decreased gate re
ceipts November 9th, indications
point to a more successful year
financially than last. I look to see
last year's deficit reduced at the
end of this semester to $400.
Harry J. Edwards, Treas.
