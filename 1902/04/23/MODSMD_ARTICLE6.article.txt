# The 						Lecture of Mr. Berwick.

Edward Berwick, Sr., of Pacific
Grove, lectured in the chapel last
night upon the subject, "The Eman
cipation of the Human Soul." The
speaker traced the growth of re
ligious thought and feeling from
the time of Roman Catholic perse
cution to the present day freedom
of belief, dwelling upon the part
taken by the Protestant outbreak,
the Puseyites, the Evangelicals,
and the Methodists.
Continuing, the speaker said:
"Credit is due to Charles Kingsley
for laying stress upon the necessity
for a whole-souled gospel, and to
Lowell, who preached the gospel of
life as well as of profession. Timid
conservatism feared that truth
could not take care of itself, that
there was conflict between religion
and science. But it has now been
clearly proven that true religion
has never been opposed to science.
What the world today needs is
more and more of the spirit of love
to unite the hearts and efforts of
those who are seeking the best. It
is vain to spend the time in theolog
ical controversies; we must realize
that we have limitations; that all
attempts to determine or detine the
Infinite have ended in 'dialectic
whirl-a-gigs.' We should all seek
the love as defined by Paul in Cor
inthians, for 'love is the fulfilling
of the law.' "
