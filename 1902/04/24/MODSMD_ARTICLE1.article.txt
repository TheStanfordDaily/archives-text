# LEE IS CAPTAIN.
## Varsity Center Was Elected by the Football Men Last Evening. 
### 
Howard S. Lee, '08, Varsity cen
ter, was unanimously elected by
the football men last evening to fill
the vacancy of captain caused by
the absence of \Y. 1. Traeger. The
meeting was held in room 1, Encina
Hall.
Lee is a member of the Sigma
Nil fraternity, registering in me
chanical engineering from Denver,
Colorado, lie made the Varsity in
his freshman year, and has played
a strong, consistent, game at center
fur three years. He prepared {or
college at Hoi brook's Military
Academy, Sing Sing on the Hud
son, where his football career be
gan. In his freshman year here
Lee played center on the team un
der diet Murphy as captain. As
a sophomore lie occupied his old
position, and proved a tower of
strength in the team which de
feated California 5 to 0. During
all of last season his work was re
markably consistent, both in the
annual game against Berkeley and
in the game at Pasadena against
the University of Michigan. Cap
tain Lee will probably play his old
position at center next year, and
will inspire confidence in his sup
porters, not only for his football
ability but likewise for the faithful
training which he will demand
from every man.
The coaching outlook for next
