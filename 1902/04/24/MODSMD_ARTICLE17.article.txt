One of the student candidates for
the position of business manager of
Question of the Daily Palo Alto
the is basing the major
Managership. p or tj on 0 f ),j 8 cam
paign on the cry that he has been
the victim of "dirty politics," and
must run to vindicate himself. In
the light of reports which have
grown out of the situation, a state
ment of affairs is here offered, that
if there be any efficacy in a plain
presentation of facts this statement
may have the desired effect, namely,
admitting the members of the stu
dent body into every detail of the
"shady transaction," so-called, and
allowing them to reason out the
truth of the matter for themselves.
Last Sunday was the day on
which the undersigned received
their first intimation that anyone
outside the present incumbent
would stand for election to the
managership of the Daily Palo
Alto. It was a contingency wholly
unexpected in view of the condi
tions which seemingly could but
be recognized by the students gener
ally.
So, when the news came of Mr.
Grider's candidacy, we, in common
with such others as have kept track
of the paper's progress from the in
side, were surprised and disap
pointed. If experience on the Daily
during the past four years had
taught the staff anything, it was
that student management of the
finances has been an illustrious
failure; that after a period of ups
and downs the paper had bid fair to
become a water-logged wreck, until
the present manager appeared on
thescene â€” a veritable God-send. We
knew that he had refused to take
up the project without a reasonable
assurance of continuity. We knew
him to be alone responsible for the
present sound status of the paper
with businessmen. It was perfectly
evident to anyone sufficiently con
versant with the facts to have the
right to an opinion, that in perma
nent, non-student management the
college daily had at last found a
means of Halvation which one year
ago seemed impossible of realiza
tion.

Such was our attitude when on
Sunday the information came that
Mr. Grider had decided to become
a candidate. The source of the
news was Mr. VV. L. Lewis, who
furthermore stated that he had
thoroughly explained the position
of the paper and that of Mr. Quelle,
to Grider, but that the latter had
insisted that he had a right to try
for the place, believed he could
manage the Daily Palo Alto, and
would run in the face of the facts
presented.
In this way were the candidate's
attitude and the fact that he had
determined to contest the eleetion
reported to the writers. A new
problem was presented. Under the
information at hand, there seemed
to be no use in consulting Grider
further. Here there may have
been a mistake on our part, since
Grider later said that at the mo
ment in question he was connider
ing a withdrawal so seriously that
an avoidance of this whole un
pleasant issue might have resulted
if he had heen again consulted.
As explained last evening, those
connected with the editorial side of
the paper had believed that, the
situation was generally understood,
that it was taken for granted that
Mr. Quelle would continue the
management for at least one more
year, and that consequently no
candidate would appear at the gen
eral election, thus allowing the Ex
ecutive Committee to extend the
present contract. Therefore, when
the case was presented as explained
above, the question arose of how to
meet the situation.
In the evening, the present editor
of the paper consulted the secretary
of the Executive Committee of last
}ear, who had taken active charge
of the paper's affairs during the
closing weeks of last spring and
who understood thoroughly the
condition of the business. At the
consultation the possibility was
discussed of getting Mr. Grider to
iippreciate the status of things and
to withdraw, and furthermore the
means to be taken in case he in
sisted on making a tight. Although
Mr. Quelle was a special student
for more than four years following
the opening of the University, and
has been manager of the press ever
since its establishment, we felt then
that his name should not be intro
duced as a candidate in a student
election, and considered the advis
ability of some student appearing
as his proxy. At this point in the
conversation a third person came
up and listened until he had meat
sufficient for a sensation, and then
spread the horrible plot. Later in
the evening one man, Chester Nar
iimore, was consulted with regard
to his willingness to run under such
conditions. He refused to do
so because of personal differ
ences with the present manager.
With all candor, however, it may
be said that no one would have
been announced as such a candi
