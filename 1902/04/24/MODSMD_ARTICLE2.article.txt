## 
### 
The Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Sig
ma, and Delta Kappa Epsilon fra
ternities have applied for the three
lots on Lasuen street, beyond the
Kappa Kappa Gamma house, and
will begin the erection of new chap
ter houses as soon as Mrs. Stan
ford affixes her signature to the
leases. The Phi Kappa Psi home
will stand next to the Kappa
house, and beyond it the Kappa
Sigma and Delta Kappa Epsilon
houses in the order named. The
narrow street connecting Lasuen
with the county road has been
closed, and the Delta Kappa Epsi
lon fraternity will occupy this space.
None of the above fraternities
have plans for their new houses in
a finished state, but as soon as ar
rangements are completed, work
will be rushed to enable them to
be occupied at the beginning of
next semester. The removal of
these three organizations to the
campus will find every fraternity
located on "theßow."
