# Passing of the Stock Farm.
## 
### 
On next Monday the annual
shipment of horses from the Palo
Alto Stock Farm to the Blue Rib
bon Sale in Cleveland, Ohio, May
12th to 17th, will take place, thirty
six head, almost all two-year-olds,
to be sent. This lot of horses is an
exceptionally fine one, and should
bring a good price, as the reputa
tion of the Palo Alto Farm is more
firm than ever since the perform
ance of Eleata, 2:08f, a world
beater from the crop of 1898,
shipped in 1900; and Romellan,
2:15i, winner of the Clark Horse
Review stake; and Stewart, 2:27,
of last year's shipment. The ani
mals are well-bred, and a majority
are entered in stakes ranging from
$26,000 to $52,000, and so far have
shown themselves to be excellent
performers. Some of them will un
doubtedly be world-famous within
a year.
Among the best bred and most
promising are Princess Elden, sister
to Eleata, 2:08J; Grove N, half
brother to Ned Thorn, Laura
cino,half-brother to Freedom, 2:29|;
Lucie, sister to Lucrativa,
Registrate, half-brother to Rotnel
lan, Menrosa, Mendovena,
La Rose, Goldress, Naza, and Man
zita.
This will be the last shipment
from the California farm to the
Cleveland sales. Next September
Mr. Covey, foreman of the farm,
will take a large number of mares,
geldings, colts, and other animals
to the State Fair in Sacramento.
In November he will auction off
stallions, brood-mares, and colts in
New York. By this time the pad
docks and stables will he emptied,
and the great Palo Alto Stock Farm
will be a thing of the past.
