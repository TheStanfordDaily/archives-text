### 
In his lecture this afternoon
Bishop Brent, the newly appointed
Bishop of Manila, did not speak of
the Philippines, or of the condition
of the people there, but of the mo
tives which should sway young
Americans as lliey face the great
problems of today. He referred
briefly to the Philippine problem
as it faces the average citizen.
"We must be tolerant above alI,"
he said, "and not criticise the mo
tives of our government's policy.
We must be patriotic, for patriotism
is the greatest of virtues. We want
the absolute patriotism of youth."
In conclusion he told of his per
sonal feeling toward bis new work.
'T go without prejudice," he con
tinued, "and I do not know of what
service 1 will be to my country, but
I go with a conviction to do the
right thing. It is a hard problem
which I have to face, but 1 take it.
up gladly."
Bishop Brent spoke clearly and
entertainingly. He paid a tribute
to Stanford, and expressed a desire
to speak here again.
