The Intercollegiate Debate tomor
row evening is the linal contest
with the University of California
tiiis year. Since the Hearst cup
was offered in 1899 to become the
permanent property of the univer
sity first winning three debates,
California has been twice success
ful and Stanford once. The con
test in Metropolitan Temple will
determine not only whether Stan
ford will even up the score of de
bates held up to date, but also
whether or not the cup will go to
California. This fact lends an in
tense interest to the battle. In ad
dition to the cup, a prize of $'200
offered by Mr. James K. Moftitt
goes to the winning team.
Each speaker in the contest will
have twenty minutes, in addition to
which California is allowed ten
minutes for affirmative rebuttal at
the close. The Stanford men have
been working very hard for the de
bate and will put up a good light.
The team will leave tomorrow on
the 3:0(5 train for the city and will
stop at the California hotel. It is
expected that a large delegation of
students will attend the debate.
President Jordan is to preside, and
the judges will be the Honorables M.
C. Sloss, R. C. Harrison, and F. L.
M urasky.
The Intercollegiate agreement
provides that the decision shall be
given in the following manner:
"Without any discussion on the
debate as presented by the speak
ers, the judges shall, at the con
clusion of the debate, proceed to
ballot for the winning team. A
majority of the ballots shall be
necessary fora decision.
"The judges shall render their
decision on the merits of the de
bate. The merits of the question
shall not be considered, save as
they are presented in the debate.''
