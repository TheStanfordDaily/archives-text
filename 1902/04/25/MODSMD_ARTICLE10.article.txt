# On Dr. Stebbins' Death.
## 
### 
We, the President and faculty
of Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, desire to express the grief
with which we have heard of the
death of the venerable Dr. Horatio
Stebbins. As a friend of both the
Founders and as a member of the
Board of Trustees, Dr. Stebbins lias
a pluce in the history of the Uni
versity. In times of darkness and
uncertainty he never lost faith,
and his advice was always sane
and cheering. It has been an en
couragement to know that in every
crisis we have enjoyed the unfalter
ing sympathy of one so wise and
good. Some of us had the privi
lege of his personal friendship, and
all, both faculty and students, felt
the beneficent influence of his occa
sional visits and addresses. In
losing him the public of the Pacific
Coast loses a force making for
righteousness that can ill be
spared; and the University loses
one of the most helpful, hopeful,
and steadfast of its friends.
Melville B. Anderson,
Chairman of Committee.
