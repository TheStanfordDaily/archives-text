# Mr. Grider Explains.
## 
### 
To whom it may concern:
No one regrets more than I that
the Daily Palo Alto lias become a
medium for the airing of political
views, hut I feel that some state
ment is due in regard to my can
didacy for the office of Business
Manager of the Daily Palo Alto.
I am not a candidate to vindicate
myself, as 1 know of nothing of
which I am to be vindicated. That
Mr. Quelle, or any one else, has a
better right to the position than 1
is a question to be decided by the
student body, and not by the editor
of the Daily Palo Alto or by my
self.
In order to show that I have done
nothing very wrong in the matter
I will simply state what I know of
the situation. About two weeks
ago (not later than April 13th) Mr.
M. F. McCormick, who, as president
of the student body and chairman
of the Executive Committee, should
know of Mr. Quelle's claims, if he
has any, visited me in my room in
Encina for the purpose of getting
information about the Sequoia.
During our conversation I told Mr.
McCormick that I was considering
the matter of being a candidate for
the office of Manager of the Daily
Palo Alto. Mr. McCormick ditl
not mention that Mr. Quelle had a
moral or any other right to the posi
tion, but tried to dissuade me for
the reason that he considered it a
risky proposition financially, lie
further stated that Mr. Quelle would
probably be a candidate. All of
the above conversation was in the
presence of a third party.
Nothing further was said to me
in regard to the matter until last
Friday morning, when, as Mr. W.
L. Lewis and 1 sat down at a lec
ture, he remarked to me that he
heard that I was going to "butt in"
and try to take his job. This re
mark was overheard by a third
party who will corroborate me.'
After the lecture Mr. Lewis en
deavored to induce me to withdraw,
giving as his reasons that it was
for the welfare of the paper. I did
not agree with him. At no time dur
ing our conversation did he men
tion that Mr. Quelle had a moral
or any other right to the position.
He gave me to understand that
this meant a financial loss to him,
and unless 1 withdrew he would
probably be a candidate. Such is
the manner in which the situation
was explained by Mr. Lewis.
The first intimation that I re
ceived that Mr. Quelle had a claim
to the position was on last Sunday,
when Mr. Hauverman told me
that some one else had told
him. I told Mr. Hauverman that
if this rumor were true that I would
withdraw. I told another person
that I was considering a with
drawal for the same reason. Since
that time events have taken place
which led to me believe that Mr.
Quelle had no better claims than
any one else. I will mention these
now. On Sunday night that third
party came to my room and told
me that he had heard the following
words spoken by Mr. Had ley to
another whom I afterwards learned
was Mr. Cantwell:
"What we want to do is to put
up a popular man who can beat
Grider, and after he is elected have
him resign, and then let the execu
tive elect Quelle."
It was further stated that the
question of last year's resignation
was discussed, and Mr. Naramore
was discussed as a probable candi

date. Mr. Naramore was ap
proached upon the subject, and lie,
afterwards told me that he was
asked to be a candidate with the
understanding that he was to re
sign after election in order that the
Executive Committee might elect
Mr. Quelle. The impression that
I received in conversation with Mr.
Naramore was that the student
body was not to know that he was
to resign. I will here state that
from the foregoing facts 1 began to
suspect '"dirty politics," and so told
my friends. On Monday evening
I was visited by a delegation con
sisting of Mr. McCormick, Mr. Had
ley, Mr. Cronyn, Mr. Hinman, and
Mr. Scott. Up to this time no one
who has any connection with the
Daily Palo Alto or with student
body officers had hinted to me that
I was doing Mr. Quelle an injus
tice. They endeavored to have me
withdraw, basing their arguments
more on the welfare of the paper
rather than on Mr. Quelle's case.
They did, however, argue Mr.
Quelle's case. I charged them with
selfish motives and I do not see
how 1 could do otherwise after the
preceding events had transpired.
Such are the facts of which 1 am
in possession. They were such as
to lead me to believe that a rinp
was trying to control the Daily
Palo Alto and that they con
sidered it a misdemeanor for an
outsider to "butt in."

giving as his reasons that it was
for the welfare of the paper. I did
not agree with him. At no time dur
ing our conversation did he men
tion that Mr. Quelle had a moral
or any other right to the position.
He gave me to understand that
this meant a financial loss to him,
and unless 1 withdrew he would
probably be a candidate. Such is
the manner in which the situation
was explained by Mr. Lewis.
The first intimation that I re
ceived that Mr. Quelle had a claim
to the position was on last Sunday,
when Mr. Hauverman told me
that some one else had told
him. I told Mr. Hauverman that
if this rumor were true that I would
withdraw. I told another person
that I was considering a with
drawal for the same reason. Since
that time events have taken place
which led to me believe that Mr.
Quelle had no better claims than
any one else. I will mention these
now. On Sunday night that third
party came to my room and told
me that he had heard the following
words spoken by Mr. Had ley to
another whom I afterwards learned
was Mr. Cantwell:
"What we want to do is to put
up a popular man who can beat
Grider, and after he is elected have
him resign, and then let the execu
tive elect Quelle."
It was further stated that the
question of last year's resignation
was discussed, and Mr. Naramore
was discussed as a probable candi

date. Mr. Naramore was ap
proached upon the subject, and lie,
afterwards told me that he was
asked to be a candidate with the
understanding that he was to re
sign after election in order that the
Executive Committee might elect
Mr. Quelle. The impression that
I received in conversation with Mr.
Naramore was that the student
body was not to know that he was
to resign. I will here state that
from the foregoing facts 1 began to
suspect '"dirty politics," and so told
my friends. On Monday evening
I was visited by a delegation con
sisting of Mr. McCormick, Mr. Had
ley, Mr. Cronyn, Mr. Hinman, and
Mr. Scott. Up to this time no one
who has any connection with the
Daily Palo Alto or with student
body officers had hinted to me that
I was doing Mr. Quelle an injus
tice. They endeavored to have me
withdraw, basing their arguments
more on the welfare of the paper
rather than on Mr. Quelle's case.
They did, however, argue Mr.
Quelle's case. I charged them with
selfish motives and I do not see
how 1 could do otherwise after the
preceding events had transpired.
Such are the facts of which 1 am
in possession. They were such as
to lead me to believe that a rinp
was trying to control the Daily
Palo Alto and that they con
sidered it a misdemeanor for an
outsider to "butt in."
