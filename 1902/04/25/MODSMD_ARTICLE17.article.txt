# Statement from Mr. Quelle.
## 
### 
Those connected with the Daily
Palo Alto are fully aware of the
fact that for several years past the
paper has not been a financial suc
cess, due less to lack of ability on
the part of the students who have
had charge than to the system,
placing the manager, as it does, in
a position where he has "every
thing to gain and nothing to lose"
—others having to bear the brunt
of possible loss. If the manage
ment is successful, the manager
reaps the benefit; if the manage
ment is unsuccessful, the loss has
to be sustained by others: —the
editor, who has received no ade
quate return for the large amount
of time he has been compelled to
devote to the paper, in some cases
having found it necessary to carry
on outside work at the same time
in order to meet his ordinary ex
penses; the printer, and those oth
ers engaged in its manufacture and
distribution. On more than one
occasion final payments have not
been made till nearly a year after
the manager's term had expired.
As the position of manager has
been given generally to a student
because he stood in need of the in
come to be derived therefrom, it is
easy to understand that the money
has been spent —though not always
earned. This, then, is one weak
point in the system: the "profits"
will assuredly be spent, but not so
assuredly earned.
When, on the other hand, the
management has been unusually
successful, there has been nothing
permanent left to show for it. The
Daily has now at the end of the
tenth year of its existence no prop
erty of its own save one desk, pre
sented by the girls of the Univer
sity who published a Woman's
Edition, Dec. 10, 1897, and devoted
the proceeds of their enterprise to
its purchase.
To offset this, the treasury "of the
Associated Students was drawn on
tor $150 with which to pay the in
debtedness of the paper for the sec
ond year following.
A year or two ago an amend
ment was passed which provides
that, should the profits in any year
exceed $100 a month, half the sur
plus must be paid into the student
body treasury, to be hold as a fund
for the benefit of the paper. As
things stand at present, only this
provision gives promise of the
paper's making any advancement
during the coming ten years over
the last decade.
However, the function of the
Daily Palo Alto is not to earn
money, but rather to render the
best possible service in presenting
the news of the University. In
order to do this many students con
tribute their services, their only re
muneration being the practical ex
perience gained. Some are forced
to devote so large a portion of their
time to the paper that it necessar
ily limits the amount of their Uni

versity work. This applies partic
ularly to the editor-in-chief, who
spends all his afternoons in the of
fice. No student can afford to do
this for the experience alone, espe
cially if he happens to be depen
dent on his own resources. The
student body constitution provides
that "the editor-in-chief shall re
ceive half the profits"—but does
not in any way guarantee that
there will be any profits —and for
some years there have been prac
tically none.
The proposition I made the Ex
ecutive Committee last year pro
vided for the foregoing conditions,
by guaranteeing the editor an
amount sufficient to pay his per
sonal expenses; and providing that
if the profits ever exceeded $100 a
month ($5O to the editor and $50
to the manager), half the surplus
should be paid into the student
body treasury.
The condition of the paper at
that time was such that no one
could expect to make it pay from
the start; but it was believed that it
could he put on a sound basis by the
end of a year. My proposition was
made, and accepted, on the under
standing that I be reappointed if
the management proved satisfac
tory. J. A. Quelle.
