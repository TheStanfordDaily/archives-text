# OUT MAY 20TH.
## Date for Appearance of 1903 "Quad."â€”Many Attractive Features Introduced. 
### 
All the proof for the 11)03 Quad
has been read and corrected, and
now only the printing and binding
remain to be done. If no unforeseen
circumstances appear, the books
will be ready for sale about May
20th. This is rather late, but the
class annuals have been brought
out even more delayed than this
one. The lateness this year has
been caused by several annoying
delays in getting cuts from the
East.
The 1903 class annual is to have
many excellent features not hith
erto attempted. The binding will
be unusually attractive, and will
be in green buckram. The princi
pal feature of the publication will
be the art and photographic work.
The athletic department will excel,
containing several fine views of the
Michigan-Stanford game at Pasa
dena. There will be colored pic
tures of two of the windows in the
Memorial Church.
Probably the new feature that
will attract the most notice is an
exact reproduction of Mrs. Stan
ford's deed conveying $32,000,000
to the trustees of the University.
This will be printed on a nine-page
folder of parchment paper.
The greater portion of the art
work in the volume has been done
by Editor Renaud, " Dick" Culver,
'99, Larrey Bowman, '01, Bristow
Adams, '01, Merle Johnson, '97,
Randall Borough, ex-'Ol, and VV.
C. Francis, ex-'O3. It may be ex
pected to compare very favorably
with the professional sketching in
the Blue and Gold just issued.
Among the special articles will
be one by Dr. Jordan on " Univer
sity Inspirations." Dr. Elliott has
written one called "Our Growing
Traditions," and Dr. Frank Angell
discusses the athletic side of the in
stitution in "Some Developments
in Stanford Athletics." Professor
Newcomer has written a poem on
the Memorial Church, and the re
views of athletics and debating
have been prepared by C. A. Cant
well and J. F. English, respectively.
There will also be in this edition
a full department devoted to the
Memorial church, with many pic
tures of both the interior and ex
terior. A history of the construc
tion of the building and elaborate
descriptions of the edifice will also
be given.
The alumni and former gradu
ates of Stanford are to figure very
prominently. There are to be
poems by W. H. Irwin, '99, Wal
lace Irwin, ex-'OO, C. K. Field, '95,
and others. The jokes will be
arranged as in former years, but
they will not be vindictive in any
way. An excellent ballad by Wal
lace Irwin heads this department.
All the typographical work on
the book is being clone in San Fran
cisco by the Stanley-Taylor Com
pany. On account of the additional
expense undergone in the prepara
tion of the volume, the class decided
to raise the price, and the edition
will accordingly sell for $2.00, in
stead of $1.50, which has heretofore
been the price.
