Cardinal rooters; a section for fac

where the event will be held, is easy
of access, being located on Fifth
street between Market and Mission,

Fifth. In the Carnot we have seen
what our men can do. With the re
alization that this is the last inter
collegiate contest of any kind
against the University of Califor
nia during the present year, and

that our rivals have the record in
their favor in recent atheletic events,
they will bend every effort to win
the debate. It will be a memora
ble contest.
