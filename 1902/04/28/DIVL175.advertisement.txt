AN ARTISTIC POSTER FREE.
Send us your name on a postal card and
we will mail to you free a new brilliantly
colored Washburn poster (size 12x18
inches). This poster is the creation of
the Viking's Head Studio, and has been
pronounced exceedingly bright and
clever. It represents a pastoral scene, a
rabbit enamored of the music of a
mandolin. Write today, this offer may
not appear again.
