# CUP WENT TO CALIFORNIA.
## Stanford Failed to Win the Intercollegiate Debate.—A Good Contest. 
### 
California won the tenth annual
Intercollegiate Debate in Metropoli
tan Hall last Saturday night, by a
unanimous decision of the three
judges.
With the announcement of this
decision, the William R. Hearst
cup, offered in 1899 to the univer
sity first winning three debates,
passed into the permanent posses
sion of the University of California.
Although a victory for the Blue
and (jiold, the debate was not a dis
appointment to the wearers of the
cardinal. It was the opinion of all
who heard the contest that Stan
ford's representatives acquitted
themselves with great credit in an
up-hill fight on the unpopular side
of an artificial and complicated
question. California won because
of better team work, more definite
progress during the debate, and a
ten-minute rebuttal readily and
forcibly delivered by Walter Roth
child.
The Stanford team and alternate,
accompanied by the men who will
debate with Washington next Fri
day night, took the 3:06 train to
the city Saturday afternoon and
went at once to the California hotel,
where rooms had been reserved for
them by the Intercollegiate Debat
ing Committee. When they ar
rived at Metropolitan Temple, the
scene of action, shortly after eight
o'clock, they found the hall almost
filled with the students and faculty
of both universities and a large
number of disinterested spectators.
A bout 200 Stanford students formed
a rooting section on the right of the
gallery, while a large number of
faculty and other Stanford parti
sans sat together 011 the main floor.
The short period which preceded
the debate was occupied, as usual,
by yells and good natured banter
between the rival rooting sections,
California triumphantly declaring
the score of the Field-day, while
Stanford replied with "Remember
the Carnot Debate."
At 8:15 President Jordan, who
presided, briefly explained the con
ditions of the contest, and stated
the question, "Resolved, That the
Southern States should grant the
suffrage to the negro in accordance
with the spirit of the Fifteenth
Amendment; provided, that all
question of the constitutionality
of the negative's position be ex
cluded."
California supported the affirma
tive, and was represented by Max
Thelen, Walter Rothchild, and
Ralph S. Pierce, who spoke in the
order named. Herbert C. Jones,
George W. Leistner, and Fletcher
B. Wagner upheld the negative for
Stanford. Each speaker was al
lowed twenty minutes, and in addi
tion Rothchild, for the affirmative,
had ten minutes for rebuttal.
The judges were the Honorables
M. C. Sloss, 11. C. Harrison, and
F. L. Murasky.
The Arguments.
Max Thelen, of California,
opened the discussion for the affirm
ative. He defined the spirit of the

Fifteenth Amendment according to
its letter—llo discrimination in the
granting of the suffrage on account
of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude. He declared that the
affirmative would not maintain
universal suffrage, but simply that
race discrimination is illogical, un
just, and ineffective. lie quoted
facts and statistics to prove that
the negro, in education, property
holding, religious training, and loy
alty, was qualified to vote. ''His
disfranchisement takes away every
inducement, present and future, to
his advancement, and embitters
and antagonizes him." Thelen pre
sented a clear case, and managed
to impress upon his audience the
point of view of the affirmative.
Hut portions of his argument did
not bear directly 011 the question.
Herbert C. Jones, '02, was the
opening speaker on the negative.
He reviewed the reconstruction
period, showing clearly how negro
suffrage was forced upon the un
willing South by Northern politic
ians and philanthropists, lleat
tacked Thelen's argument on the
ground that much of it was based
on the assumption that the negro's
progress bad been due to the fran
chise, whereas the affirmative must
uphold the enfranchisement of
an already disfranchised class.
Throughout the Southern States,
the disfranchisement of the negro
lias been gradually accomplished
by means of various technical de
vices. Jones admitted that the
black race in the South has made a
certain amount of progress, but it
has been imitative, the veneer of
civilization. The negro race is
fundamentally weak and lacking
in morality. An educational test
will never suffice, because the mere
ability to read and write is not
political judgment. .Jones closed
his speech with a strong, eloquent
plea for the point of view of the
white South, comparing the race
antagonism in the Southern States
with the feelings of Californians to
ward the Chinese. Jones argued
forcibly and presented a well-pro
portioned speech in an agreeable
way.
Walter Rothchild resumed the
thread of the affirmative argument
where his colleague had left it. He
repeated the contention of the first
affirmative that the disfranchise
ment of the negro was illogical, un
just, and ineffective. He main
tained that the ballot was an edu
cation in itself, an incentive to the
building of character and the ac
quisition of property. "You can't
lit a race for self-government by
keeping it a subject race. The dis
franchisement of the negro does
harm to him, and to the poor
white, who is allowed to vote, in
creases the burden of the South,
and worse still, deprives the negro
of all participation in the govern
ment of the South." Rothchild
closed with the ingenious contention
that the disfranchisement of the
negro was undemocratic, thus im
plying that universal suffrage was
a principle of our democracy, an
inalienable right rather than a
privilege,—a contention which the
lirst affirmative had expressly de
nied. Rothchild gave the impres-
