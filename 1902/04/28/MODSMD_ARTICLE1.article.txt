# CUP WENT TO CALIFORNIA.
## Stanford Failed to Win the Intercollegiate Debate.—A Good Contest. 
### 
California won the tenth annual
Intercollegiate Debate in Metropoli
tan Hall last Saturday night, by a
unanimous decision of the three
judges.
With the announcement of this
decision, the William R. Hearst
cup, offered in 1899 to the univer
sity first winning three debates,
passed into the permanent posses
sion of the University of California.
Although a victory for the Blue
and (jiold, the debate was not a dis
appointment to the wearers of the
cardinal. It was the opinion of all
who heard the contest that Stan
ford's representatives acquitted
themselves with great credit in an
up-hill fight on the unpopular side
of an artificial and complicated
question. California won because
of better team work, more definite
progress during the debate, and a
ten-minute rebuttal readily and
forcibly delivered by Walter Roth
child.
The Stanford team and alternate,
accompanied by the men who will
debate with Washington next Fri
day night, took the 3:06 train to
the city Saturday afternoon and
went at once to the California hotel,
where rooms had been reserved for
them by the Intercollegiate Debat
ing Committee. When they ar
rived at Metropolitan Temple, the
scene of action, shortly after eight
o'clock, they found the hall almost
filled with the students and faculty
of both universities and a large
number of disinterested spectators.
A bout 200 Stanford students formed
a rooting section on the right of the
gallery, while a large number of
faculty and other Stanford parti
sans sat together 011 the main floor.
The short period which preceded
the debate was occupied, as usual,
by yells and good natured banter
between the rival rooting sections,
California triumphantly declaring
the score of the Field-day, while
Stanford replied with "Remember
the Carnot Debate."
At 8:15 President Jordan, who
presided, briefly explained the con
ditions of the contest, and stated
the question, "Resolved, That the
Southern States should grant the
suffrage to the negro in accordance
with the spirit of the Fifteenth
Amendment; provided, that all
question of the constitutionality
of the negative's position be ex
cluded."
California supported the affirma
tive, and was represented by Max
Thelen, Walter Rothchild, and
Ralph S. Pierce, who spoke in the
order named. Herbert C. Jones,
George W. Leistner, and Fletcher
B. Wagner upheld the negative for
Stanford. Each speaker was al
lowed twenty minutes, and in addi
tion Rothchild, for the affirmative,
had ten minutes for rebuttal.
The judges were the Honorables
M. C. Sloss, 11. C. Harrison, and
F. L. Murasky.
The Arguments.
Max Thelen, of California,
opened the discussion for the affirm
ative. He defined the spirit of the

Fifteenth Amendment according to
its letter—llo discrimination in the
granting of the suffrage on account
of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude. He declared that the
affirmative would not maintain
universal suffrage, but simply that
race discrimination is illogical, un
just, and ineffective. lie quoted
facts and statistics to prove that
the negro, in education, property
holding, religious training, and loy
alty, was qualified to vote. ''His
disfranchisement takes away every
inducement, present and future, to
his advancement, and embitters
and antagonizes him." Thelen pre
sented a clear case, and managed
to impress upon his audience the
point of view of the affirmative.
Hut portions of his argument did
not bear directly 011 the question.
Herbert C. Jones, '02, was the
opening speaker on the negative.
He reviewed the reconstruction
period, showing clearly how negro
suffrage was forced upon the un
willing South by Northern politic
ians and philanthropists, lleat
tacked Thelen's argument on the
ground that much of it was based
on the assumption that the negro's
progress bad been due to the fran
chise, whereas the affirmative must
uphold the enfranchisement of
an already disfranchised class.
Throughout the Southern States,
the disfranchisement of the negro
lias been gradually accomplished
by means of various technical de
vices. Jones admitted that the
black race in the South has made a
certain amount of progress, but it
has been imitative, the veneer of
civilization. The negro race is
fundamentally weak and lacking
in morality. An educational test
will never suffice, because the mere
ability to read and write is not
political judgment. .Jones closed
his speech with a strong, eloquent
plea for the point of view of the
white South, comparing the race
antagonism in the Southern States
with the feelings of Californians to
ward the Chinese. Jones argued
forcibly and presented a well-pro
portioned speech in an agreeable
way.
Walter Rothchild resumed the
thread of the affirmative argument
where his colleague had left it. He
repeated the contention of the first
affirmative that the disfranchise
ment of the negro was illogical, un
just, and ineffective. He main
tained that the ballot was an edu
cation in itself, an incentive to the
building of character and the ac
quisition of property. "You can't
lit a race for self-government by
keeping it a subject race. The dis
franchisement of the negro does
harm to him, and to the poor
white, who is allowed to vote, in
creases the burden of the South,
and worse still, deprives the negro
of all participation in the govern
ment of the South." Rothchild
closed with the ingenious contention
that the disfranchisement of the
negro was undemocratic, thus im
plying that universal suffrage was
a principle of our democracy, an
inalienable right rather than a
privilege,—a contention which the
lirst affirmative had expressly de
nied. Rothchild gave the impres-
sion of being a clever, ingenious
speaker, rather than an argumenta
tive one. He had a way of turning
toward his opponents, and talking
directly to them, which was very
effective.
G. W. Leistner, '04, the second
speaker on the negative, referred
again to the reconstruction days,
which immediately followed the
Civil War, dwelling with special
emphasis on the negro domina
tion which the possession of the
ballot, for a short period, made
possible. "Under the carpet-bag
gers, the negro with the ballot was
like a maniac with a sword. He
went about destroying. The South
ern States bankrupt and on the
verge of ruin—that was negro
statesmanship." After painting,
in graphic terms, the condition of
the South as long as the negro was
permitted, to vote, and describing
the foundation of the Solid South,
which was made necessary bv the
danger of continued negro rule,
Leistner passed to an interpreta
tion of the spirit of the Fifteenth
Amendment. He declared that the
amendment, as intended by its
framers, was universal suffrage,
and cited several authorities in sup
port of this view. "But, even ad
mitting the interpretation offered
by the affirmative," Leistner con
cluded, "discrimination by means
of an educational test is had in
theory and practice. It cannot be
enforced, and it won't be enforced.
The proud South will never give
way to her ex-slaves. Call it
prejudice, if you like, but wherever
the white race comes in conflict
with an inferior race, the white
race is going to rule." Leistner
made the mistake of dwelling too
much on the historical aspect of the
question, ground which had already
been covered by the first negative.
Ralph S. Pierce, the only mem
ber of either team who had spoken
before in an annual intercollegiate
debate and the closing speaker on
the affirmative, delivered what was
from the point of view of the audi
ence perhaps the most effective
speech of the evening. He talked
rapidly, but with great distinct
ness, having a slight rolling of his
"r's," which was particularly no
ticeable in the word "negro." He
reviewed the arguments of his col
leagues, reiterating the contention
that the policy of the negative was
illogical, unjust, and ineffective.
He contended again that the spirit
of the Fifteenth Amendment, a
phrase which gave rise to consider
able difficulty throughout the
whole debate, meant simply "no
discrimination on account of race,
color, or previous condition of serv
itude." He based the greater part
of his argument on the value of an
educational lest as the only good
solution of the race problem in the
South, contending that such an ex
pedient would remove the ignorant
voters of both races, and improve
the standard of white, as well as
negro, citizenship. He failed, how
ever, to give any instances of the
practicability of such a test, or to
show how it could he applied in
the future.
Fletcher B. Wagner, '02, deliv
ered the last speech for Stanford,
and the concluding negative speech.
He said that the affirmative had
violated the point of the question
by representing their position to be
the established one, and that of the
negative an innovation. He sum

marized the speeches of his two
colleagues in his own words, by
contending that the boundary line
of suffrage is determined approxi
mately, and for practical grounds.
Most negro leaders are mulattoes,
the true negroes forming a class
which can well be spared. The
educational test is impractical and
will not meet the needs of the case.
History does not recommend negro
voting. The feeling of the white
Southerner must be taken into ac
count in this question, which is
one of legislation. For his own as
pect of the question, Wagner chose
the welfare of the negro. "The
negro's interests will not suffer by
race distinction in suffrage. The
ballot has not been a practical bul
wark of liberty. It is not cast in a
way to earn respect. It does not
educate the negro, hut by a false
ideal has hindered his industrial
progress. Any extension at the
present time would bring him no
real good, and would alienate his
neighbor." Wagner's speech was
clear, able, and ingenious, with the
force of individual personality. He
impressed his audience in a con
vincing way with a point of view
that was at once comprehensive
and tolerant.
Walter Rothchild delivered the
ten-minute rebuttal speech for the
affirmative. He answered several
of the negative arguments with
readiness and skill. In summing
up Ihe attitude of the affirmative,
he declared their solution of the
race problem to be an educational
test, and characterized the attitude
of the negative as "illogical, un
just, and ineffective."
A unanimous decision for the af
firmative was announced, after a
brief adjournment of the judges (o
cast their ballots for the winning
team, by the Honorable M. C. Sloss.
