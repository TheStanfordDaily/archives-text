Editor Daily Palo Ai/ro:
The controversy as to the man
agement of the Daily Palo Alto
seems to be superficially understood
by many of those by whose judg
ment next Wednesday will be de
termined the ultimate good of the
paper. The question is primarily
one of policy, and secondarily of
justice, and is not in any direct
way connected with the relative
fitness or eligibilty of either candi
date for the office.
The majority of former student
managers have failed to benefit the
financial status of the paper. There
has been no permanent or solid
financial backing, and at the end
of each year the paper is materially
as weak as at the beginning. The
only financial backing has been
the credit of the student body. In
many Eastern universities the daily
publications possess a sinking fund
whereby they stand on an inde
pendent basis and can award prizes,
promoting student enterprise, print
pictures of teams and athletes, pub
lish six days in the week, issue spe
cial editions, maintain telegraphic
and bulletin service of contests
away from the campus, and own at
least a dictionary—something not
possessed by the Daily Pai.o Alto.
This is the result of some perma
nent and established policy of man
agement. Our editorial policy is a
permanent one. Why not the man
agement be as permanent? If for
any reason an editor has to leave
college there are many equally effi
cient men on the staff who can take
up the editorial work. On the
other hand, suppose, as has been
the case often enough, a manager
is forced to leave liis work. He
alone is the one who has outlined
the financial policy for the year,
and with his loss I he paper suffers
a crisis from which it takes months
to recover. Advertisers are dissat
isfied with loose management and
suspect that the rates are made to
suit the occasion. With a man
agement founded on business prin
ciples the rates will be permanent,
and the advertisers constant.
Students have gotten more ma
terial benefit this year than for
many years in the past. One man
ager, who was supposed to have
done unusually well, owed a deficit
of $800 at the end of the year.
Another left the paper in debt $150
which eventually came out of the
student body treasury. And a third
spent his first year after graduation
in securing funds to meet the debts
which he had incurred while man
aging the Daily. As it is now, stu
dents do all the soliciting and get
from 15 to 25 percent of all re
ceipts. The editor is guaranteed $2
per issue; so that students have re
alized from $70 t<»sBo per month.
That the management has been
superior this year in so far as the
paper is concerned is shown by the
fact that there have been about
twenty more issues for the year,
that the editorial room has been
enlarged and fitted up with sub
stantial file shelves, and that a tel
ephone has been placed at the dis
posal of the editorial staff. All
this added expense has been met
by the manager, in addition to al
lowing the regular percentage to so
licitors, and salary to the editor.
At the beginning of this year the
condition of the paper financially
was the worst of its history
for years. C. A. Cant well was
elected business manager for the
year but was forced to resign be

cause of other outside work. Al
though the committee endeavored
for over a week after Cantwell's
resignation to find some one who
would assume the management, no
one could be found who would be
willing to shoulder the responsibil
ity, until J. A. Quelle made the fol
lowing proposition, which was ac
cepted by the Execnt ive Committee:
He agreed to assume the publica
tion in accordance with the consti
tution of the Associated Students,
land further guaranteed that the
share of the editor-in-chief in the
profits of the publication should
not be less than $2.00 per issue—on
the condition of re-appointment,
provided the experience of the en
suing year should indicate the de
sirability of such proceeding.
Mr. Quelle has faithfully kept his
end of the contract, and, in justice
to him, should be allowed a second
year in office.
The foregoing facts are submitted i
in the hope that they will throw I
some light on the situation, the j
true status of which seems to lie!
obscured by a heated personal con-;
troversy. Frank Hinman.
