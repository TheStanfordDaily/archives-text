# STANFORD NIGHT.
## Faculty and Alumni Spoke at University Club, San Francisco.â€”Remarks of Crothers, '95. 
### 
Friday evening was Stanford
night at the University Club in
San Francisco. President Jordan
acted as toast-master, and Profes
sors Angell, liolfe, and Stillman
spoke for the Stanford faculty,
Professor O'Neill for the Univer
sity of California, and George E.
Crothers, ' C JS, for the alumni. A
quartette composed of Stanford
students and alumni rendered sev
eral selections. In all, about one
hundred guests were present.
Parts of Mr. Crothers' speech, re
ferring to the true university spirit
and loyalty, are quoted below:
"The loyalty of which I speak is
based upon an interest in the bet
terment of mankind and in the
maintenance of the principles for
which our great universities stand,
and not alone that founded upon
tradition or mere love for our Alma
Mater because it happens to be
such. Such loyalty leaves the in
dividual free, not to attack an in
stitution upon mere suspicion or
from selfish motives, but to criti
cise it unreservedly in a friendly
spirit and with a view of rectifying
real or imaginary errors. It allows
the individual within as well as
without the university perfect free
dom of opinion, however ill-founded
it may be, and permits of the free
expression of that opinion private
ly, and also upon all appropriate
public occasions. This loyalty
recognizes in the university but an
instrument for the service of the
great mass of the public.
"No great universities have gone
farther than California and Stan
ford toward the recognition of this
principle. With but a fractional
portion of Stanford University's
vast endowment it would just as
surely become a great institution;
but not without charging large tui
tion fees. This fact is as well
known to Mrs. Stanford as to any
of us. But Stanford University
was not founded merely to form a
great monument to the memory of
its founders. They had the inter
ests of the poor boys and girls of
California and America in mind.
They deemed it of utmost impor
tance that poverty alone should
not stand in the way of those who
are worthy and competent, and
who are desirous of receiving a uni
versity education. This principle
lias since become fully recognized
by the people of California, and
the result is that we have an un
surpassed state university as well
as the most promising free non
state university in existence. The
importance to California of main
taining at least the collegiate de
partments of the universities upon
this basis is apparent. The world
is watching our experiment with
interest, so that our success will
tend to bring other institutions of

higher education within the reach
of all competent and deserving
persons."
