### 
The annual Pennsylvania relay
races held last Saturday on Frank
lin field were marked by the break
ing of two world's records, of one
American intercollegiate record,
and the equaling of a world's rec
ord. Harvard lowered the world's
record time for the mile relay to
3:21 2-5 from that of 3:23 1-5 made
by Harvard in 1897. Pennsyl
vania lowered the two-mile relay
record made by Princeton two
years ago one fifth of a second,
making it in 8:04 4-5. Gray of
Pennsylvania cleared the bar at
11 feet 8 inches in the pole
vault, raising the American inter
collegiate record inches. And
Duffy of Georgetown in both heats
of the 100-yard dash equaled the
world's record of 9 4-5 seconds.
The time made by the four Har
vard men each quarter mile in the
mile relay was, in the order, 49 4-5,
51, 49 4-5, and 50 4-5. That made
for each half-mile in the two-mile
relay by the Pennsylvania men
was, 2:01 3-5, 2:00 4-5, 2:00, and
2:02 2-5. The four-mile relay was
won by Yale in slow time, the av
erage for each mile being 5:00.
Magee of Chicago raised the pole
vault record by a half inch, but
could not equal Gray's phenomenal
vault of 11 feet 8 inches.
