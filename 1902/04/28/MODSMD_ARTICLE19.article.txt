# The
						"Sequoia."

### 
The best thing in the current
number of the Sequoia is "The
Mother of Annette," a strong story
by Miss Florence Hey wood. Other
good features are "John Robertson,
Jr., and His Arkolan" by Isaac
Russell, and "There Is No Rest" by
T. E. Stephenson. The Sonnet,
"Meadow Lark," by Laura M.
Everett, is the feature of the verse.
The Sketch-Book is made up of a
number of articles with only in
itials appended.
