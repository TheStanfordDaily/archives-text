# SUCCESSFUL TRIP.
## Antigone Company Returned Yesterday from Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Santa Barbara. 
### 
Sunday morning at 9:41 the An
tigone company returned from their
Southern trip. The undertaking
succeeded far beyond expectations.
At the three cities, Los Angeles,
Pasadena, and Santa Barbara, per
formances were given and the thea
ters were tilled. At Los Angeles
every seat was sold. In each case
the audiences were very apprecia
tive, more so, perhaps, than they
had been at the University. They
were quick to see and to recognize
the good points in the acting of the
principals, and were responsive to
the work of the chorus.
At Pasadena a good house, a good
stage, and rest after traveling, all
combined to make that performance
the best on the trip. In spite of
most exacting care the voices of the
cast and chorus were affected by
colds so that it was with more or
less difficulty that the parts were
carried.
Although playing to large houses
every night, the expenses were more
than the receipts. The length of
the railroad journey alone called
for a greater outlay than could well
be met in three performances. Con
sidered sociably the trip was a most
complete success. Every person in
the party, seventy-seven people, had
an enjoyable time. All enjoyed the
common pleasures. Any scheme
for amusement was always made to
include every member of the party.
At Santa Barbara, where the com
pany spent all day Saturday,
through the kindness of Mrs. Cook
sey a tallv-ho ride was provided
for the men of the party. After
visiting the famous old Santa Bar
bara Mission the party drove
through the foothills to Montecito
school, where a lunch was provided.
The return was made along the sea
side boulevard. At the same time
eight or nine of the boys hired
horses and rode over the beautiful
mountain road, joining the tally
ho at Montecito. In the afternoon
the cast and acting chorus was en
tertained at a tea given by Mrs.
Whitehead at the Country Club
house at Montecito.
