# "The Kernel and Husk."
## 
### 
The Rev. Bradford Leavitt of the
First Unitarian Church of San
Francisco preached in the chapel
Sunday. His theme was u The
Kernel and the Husk of Religion."
In a sermon which rang with sim
plicity, sincerity, and eloquence he
developed in full the difference be
tween "religiosity" and true relig
ion. He showed that, even in the
time of Christ, true religion was
neglected in useless discussions 011
the intricate niceties of the ritual,
discussions fostered by the advo
cates of "religiosity." He then
showed the difference between what
"religiosity'' and religion offers to a
man in mental or spiritual suffer
ing. An unhappy being receives
as little hope from the superficial,
and often senseless, arguments of
the disciples of "religiosity" as
does a thirsty man receive new life
from a discussion 011 the history
and uses of water. This state of

affairs, he said, has not changed at
the present time. Sermons from
the pulpit, as well as religious
journals, are prone to offer not the
simple, never-changing doctrines of
Christ that go to make true relig
ion, hut rather hollow discussions
about the mere technique and form
in which true religion may find ex
pression.
The subject is one on which Mr.
Laavitt feels very strongly, and his
earnestness in developing it was as
much a protest against such a
lamentable state of affairs as his
own sermon was a contrast to the
class against which he takes excep
tion.
A simple and heartfelt prayer
closed with an appeal to all to
let true religion displace the posi
tion that is too often heldâ€”the
mere husk of religion.
