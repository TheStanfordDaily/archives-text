### 
Dr. Ewald Fliigel, head of the
English Philology department, has
completed his work for this term
and leaves the University for a va
cation next Thursday. He is going
first with his wife and children to
Newark, New Jersey, to visit a
brother. From there he will make
trips to Cambridge, New Haven,
Baltimore, and Washington. He
is editor-in-chief of the Early Eng
lish division of the Millenial Series,
a work dealing with a thousand
years of English literature, to be
published by Heath & Co., and he
visits these colleges in connection
with the work. He will sail for
Europe on the fifteenth of next
month and go to Leipsic, his old
home. There he will leave his
family and take a trip to England,
where he will study through the
summer at Oxford, Cambridge, and
at the British Museum. He will
return to resume his work here
toward the end of next September.
