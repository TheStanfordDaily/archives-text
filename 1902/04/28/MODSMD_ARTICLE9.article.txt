From the standpoint of recorded
victories, this has not been a Stan
ford year. The Hearst debating
cup becomes the permanent prop
erty of the University of California.
The football game, the baseball
series, the Field-day, the tennis, and
even the Chess have gone against us.
We have the Freshman football and
the Carnot medal as sole trophies of
the year. But, in spite of thin ap
parently overwhelming adverse
record, the satisfaction of students
of Stanford in the performances
of the year, in the spirit and sports
manship shown by those who rep
resented us, and in the determina
tion to overcome odds, surpasses
the elation that might result from
an unbroken list of easily won vic
tories. Every student is proud of
the record we have made, proud of
the men and the teams. To enter ob
viously losing fights with the deter
mination not to yield an inch ex
cept to the exercise of superior expe
rience and force, is the true heroism
of sportsmanship. In the debate .Sat
urday night our speakers made a
creditable showing. But they had
what proved to be the weaker side
of a hard question, and met a strong
team which made the most of its
advantage. The Cardinal debaters,
however, won honors, and some of
their arguments displayed an
ability and cleverness that was re
markable.
We salute California for her suc
cess, and expect to meet her next
year, giving her all and more than
she can overcome in competition.
