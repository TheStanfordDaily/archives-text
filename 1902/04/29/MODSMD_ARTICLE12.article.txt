Nearly every student hae had
sufficient experience in voting not
to require a repetition of instruc
tions, which will appear on the
ballots at the election tomorrow,
with regard to marking the tickets.
Nevertheless, some trouble has
been caused in the past by the fail
ure of a few voters to observe the
simple directons, making it diffi
cult to know their exact intention.
A simple cross at the direct lefl
of the candidate whom one wishes
to elect is all that is required.
Technically, if this mark is placed
at the right, the ballot may be can
celed. Vote for one candidate
each for president, for vice-presi
dent, for secretary, for treasure),
and for editor and business man
ager of the puclications; vote for
two candidates from each of the
three lower classes for mem
bers of the Executive Commit
tee; and for eight candidates from
the student body at large for the
Athletic Committee.
