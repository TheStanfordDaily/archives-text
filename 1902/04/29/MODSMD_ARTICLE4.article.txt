# SPOKE ON THOREAU.
## Son of Ralph Waldo Emerson Told of the Eccentric New Englander. 
### 
Before an interested audience
which jiacked the chapel to the
very doors, Edward Waldo Emer
son, the son of Ralph Waldo Enier
erson, spoke today on the man
whose name is intimately related
to that of his fatherâ€”Thoreau.
The subject was approached
from a personal standpoint, so that
as the speaker gradually unfolded
the story of Thoreau's life, the sym
pathy with which he looked at it
gradually cropped out and held
his listeners as no other influence
could have done.
The relation between Ralph
Waldo Emerson and Thoreau was
too well known to demand atten
tion, but Mr. Emerson introduced
his talk with a brief sketch of his
own relations with the eccentric
New Englander. He spoke of the
freedom that existed in the rela
tions of Thoreau to his own house
hold, of his. goings and his comings,
hampered by no restrictions of time
or place.
Then followed a personal de
scription of the man, which by its
vividness and strength seemed to
place that simple, unassuming fig
ure before the eyes of the audience.
His position as a friend and com
panion of the children of Concord
was touched upon. From earliest
time when, as an unparalleled
story-teller, he held his little listen
ers bound by the spell of his match
less tongue, to the time when he
led them alield as their instructor
in woodcraft, Thoreau was ever the
teacher and the friend of the
young.
Mr. Emerson then spoke of the
position Thoreau occupied in his
own town and county during his
life, and referred to the unjust and
often malicious contemporary criti
cism: how he was lazy, selfish,
irreligious, unpatriotic, and super
ficial, as gauged by the men at
whose side he walked. After this
outline of Thoreau's position while
alive, Mr. Emerson discussed the
place he really occupies and the
one he holds today.
He spoke of Thoreau's birth and
childhood and the training he re
ceived at Harvard; of his return to
Concord in '37, and of the Concord
Academy established by the two
brothers. During the next sum
mer there came into the life of
Thoreau a great grief. His brother
and a little child of whom he was
very fond both died. He entered
"into a valley of sorrow, where he
walked alone during the rest of his
life." From here Mr. Emerson led
him to the shores of Walden Pond,
where were spent the two years of
his life by which Thoreau is best
known and oftenest judged. He
went to Walden to he alone with
Nature and to work, to shake off
the binding customs of his social
surroundings, and here he stayed
until he found himself falling into
the rut of the path he had blazed.
Of his after life in Concord, Mr.
Emerson spoke at length, of the
weariness and the sordidness of it
all, and the rebellion from its slav
ish restrictions. He told how Tho

reau when taxed with his short
comings was wont to reply: "If 1
do not keep step with others, it is
because 1 hear a different drum
mer.' Mr. Emerson left his audi
ence to judge between the two: the
one which moved the multitude,
and the one which inspired this
man on his lofty and independent
course.
Mr. Emerson referred briefly to
Thoreau's literary work and the
position he occupies as one of
America's literary men. The lec
ture closed with a glowing tribute
to the qualities of the man, quali
ties so superior as to have made
him felt in whatever path he chose
to walk, and to have made his loss
a real and striking one.
