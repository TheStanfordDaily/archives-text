In its editorial columns of a recent
date the Boston Herald speaks as
follows of the reported appointment
of Rev. R. lieber Newton as
preacher of the Memorial Church:
"Having found a place of worship
for its students, Stanford University
also seems to have found a preacher,
Rev. R. Heber Newton of New York
City, whose radical utterances on
religious and social topics have
made him a conspicuous figure in
the Protestant Episcopal Church at
a time when he was in good physical
and mental form, and able to be
disputatious.
"That Dr. Newton, after thirty
three years of service in the Epis
copal Church as a parish rector,
now goes to the Pacific Coast to
preach a liberal form of Chris
tianity to the youth who flock to
Leland Stanford Jr. UDiversity is an
interesting phenomenon, doubly so
because he will not only preach on
Sunday but teach ethics during the
week, and thus come in very close
touch with the student body.
"The decision to have one
preacher for the university rather
than a rotating board of preachers
as at Harvard, Cornell, and the
University of Chicago doubtless
was determined somewhat by the
geographical isolation of the Uni
versity from the centers of popula
tion where reside those men who
are most in demand as university
preachers today; men who can in
terpret religion in modern termin
ology; men who have adjusted
themselves to the new concepts of
life. Not that the University, with
its vast resources of money, could
not afford to call to the men from
the East, but because the busy
Eastern pastors, or preachers in
theological schools, who are already
giving so much of their time to this
most influential form of personal
service for national betterment, are
so rushed and overworked now that
a trip to the Pacific Coast and back
is not to be contemplated as a Light
matter."
