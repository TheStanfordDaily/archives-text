# May-pole Dance at Carnival.
## 
### 
The committee in charge of the
Elizabethan Carnival has decided
to give an old English May-pole
dance, which will undoubtedly be
one of the prettiest features of the
entertainment. The dancers, about
fifteen girls, in costume, will be ar
ranged in two circles around the
pole, and each will carry the end of
a fiower-decked strand which at
taches to the pole. As they dance
around the pole the circles will
gradually be narrowed, until the
strands become shorter and more
closely wound to the pole. The
use of flowers is the English cus
tom, and will he much prettier
than the use of ribbon strands.
All those who are interested in
the May-pole dance are requested to
meet for a short time with Mrs.
Hodges, at 7 p.m. Saturday.
