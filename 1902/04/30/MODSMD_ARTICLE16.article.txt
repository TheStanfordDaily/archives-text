Two members of the Stanford
Law faculty, Professor Hall and
Professor Whittier, both young
men, have accepted offers of full
professorships in the new law de
partment at the University of Chi
cago, which has almost unlimited
resources, with the entire range of
American universities from which to
choose. The loss to us now seems
irreparable, but it is a striking
compliment to the ability of the
men who are building up the Stan
ford department and who are gain
ing their first experience here.
Professor Whittier is a Stanford
graduate, so that this recognition
comes as a compliment to the Uni
versity as well as to himself.
