Undergraduate elections offer
an excellent field for students of
politics to observe the practical
working of the ballot, and to draw
lessons therefrom. It is amusing
and at the same time pathetic to
see so many people exercising the
right to vote which belongs to them,
and giving expression to the die
tates of some one else, without, ap
parently, having devoted any con
sideration to the merits of candi
dates or questions involved before
they come to the polls. This would
not be surprising in the outside
world, but here we are supposed to

he preparing for intelligent citizen
ship and for an exercise of judg
ment in public affairs. The issues
decided at a student election are
not of great consequence, and yet the
idea of so many people going to the
polls and gaining all their enlight
enment after the hallot is in their
hands, is a striking object lesson
on the suffrage question.
