# RECEPTION IN SOUTH.
## Writer in "Los Angeles Express" Reviewed Antigone with Enthusiasm. 
### 
All idea of the reception accorded
the Antigone in the South may he
gained from the following from the
Los Angeles Express signed ''The
Listener":
"It was a royal reception given
the Stanford University students
and professors last evening at the
Los Angeles theater in their pre
sentation of the 'Antigone of Sopho
cles' with Mendelssohn's music.
And closely and enthusiastically
did the large audience follow the
somber tragedy; sympathetically
did it wait upon the sorrows of the
persecuted Antigone, attending with
marked deference the musical ha
rangues of the chorus.
"Impressive and stately was the
interpretation of this ancient mas
terpiece, this bit of fancy fashioned
by one who lived 400 years or more
before our Christ. So long dead,
yet the word he has left us served
last night to stir the heart, start
moisture to the eye —all for an An
tigone and a Haemon, a lover and
his lass, who were the cruel sport
of unkind fate. So old, so new, the
story!
"It is difficult to appreciate the
magnitude of presenting a Greek
drama in the original. This is only
the fifth time Antigone has been
heard in America, a fact that will
go to show it is a task not at
tempted often. Too much praise
cannot be given the excellent rendi
tion offered by the faculty and
pupils last evening. With orches
tra and voices drawn from the
ranks of the University, the music
under the direction of Mr. Scott-
Brook was beautifully executed.
In 'Love's Power' and the 'Invoca
tion to Bacchus' the chorus acquit
ted itself so admirably that repeti
tions were demanded. And a Greek
chorus is no lay figure; would that
our modern choruses were so neces
sary, so intelligent and enjoyable
as this accompaniment of the old
Greek drama.
"There was a dignity in the work
of all taking part, a sweet serious
ness, a rapt intensity that threw a
glamour of nearness over the scenes,
rolled back the years, and gave to
one a breath of that Attic air in
which Sophocles lived and worked.
"Miss Eunice Cooksey, the Antig
one, was an ideal Grecian maiden.
Brave as any man, with the tender
heart of a woman, a heart bleading
for her dear dead; with bursts of
righteous wrath, becoming one suf
fering the displeasure of the gods,
her impersonation was exquisitely
poetical. Ismene proved a gentle
foil to her statelier sister, and was
very prettily done by Miss Esther
Crandall. Creon, the hateful king,
was made terrible enough by Pro
fessor A. T. Murray, whose sonor
ous delivery of the lines was
thoroughly enjoyed.
"Comparatively a minor part, but
so well taken as to call Bpecial at
tention to it, was the Guard of Mr.
J. K. Bonnell, in perfect sympa
thy with the spirit of the character
and with facial expression and ges
tures that in themselves were a
translation of the text. Mr. Bon

nell's translation was a wonderful
bit of art.
"Mrs. J. P. Hall as the queen
looked the Greek matron to perfec
tion, and right regally did she
mourn. One ought not to forget
Haemon, the disconsolate lover,
and truly he was good to look upon.
And so were they all, chorus and
principals. And how they could
talk Greek, and sing Mendelssohn
music, too! We shall not forget
soon those haunting refrains,
voiced so manfully by these good
students. How Leader Brook
kept them all in order was a mys
tery; an eye for the chorus on the
stage, another for the supplemen
tary chorus, and —well, he should
have been argus-ej'ed, because there
was the orchestra, besides, com
posed of a goodly number of young
men and women, not to mention
the pretty girl at the piano, all
watching his baton.
"Ah, well, our players have gone
by, now. All thanks for the beau
tiful vision they evoked from the
long past. Certainly Los Angeles
has demonstrated its appreciation
of Greek tragedy by the hearty wel
come accorded it on this occasion,
and another year, let us hope, we
shall be invited to a similar feast
of the gods, such as we enjoyed last
night in the 'Antigone of Sopho
cles.' "
