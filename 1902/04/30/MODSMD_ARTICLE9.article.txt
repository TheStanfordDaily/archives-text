# PROF. WHITTIER TO LEAVE.
## Becomes Full Professor in Law Department at University of Chicago. 
### 
Professor Clarke Butler Whittier,
associate professor of Law, will
sever his connection with the fac
ulty of Stanford University at the
close of this semester. The news
that he will leave to accept a full
professorship in the new law de
partment established at Chicago,
comes as an added disappointment
to Stanford students in view of the
fact that Professor Hall will go at
the same time.
The school to be established at
Chicago next year will have for its
dean Joseph H. Beale, author of
the Beale text-books of law, who re
signed a professorship at Harvard
to take charge of the new depart
ment. Professor Whittier will re
ceive a decided increase in salary
over the one paid him here.
Professor Whittier first attended
the University of the Pacific, but
entered Stanford in his senior year
when, owing to faculty troubles,
nearly the whole senior class left
and came to Stanford. He was
graduated from Stanford in 1893,
and received his LL. B. degree
from Harvard in 1896. He came
to Stanford as an instructor in Law
in the fall of '97. The courses he
has given here have been in Con
tracts, Torts, Evidence and Plead
ing; it is understood that, while his
work at Chicago will be along those
lines, the courses he will give will
be largely of his own choosing.
Professor Whittier while a mem
ber of the Stanford Law faculty
has commanded a position of re
spect and admiration for his abili
ties, and his personal qualities
have brought him universal esteem.
His departure will be keenly felt
by faculty, students, and the de
partment.
