One thing was made more
evident yesterday than in
any previous student body elec
tion—some method is necessary
that will restrict the ballot to
students who feel at least a small
degree of responsibility. Probably
no change would have occurred in
the results yesterday if the vote
had been so limited. This, never
theless, does not obliterate the fact
that many ballots were cast in
which the voter knew absolutely
nothing of the candidates marked
on the ticket, and cared nothing.
The situation demands an amend
ment to the constitution, giving
voice for the control of student af
fairs to those only who have paid
their assessment to the Associated
Students. Then only persons really
interested will vote. One man,
through a large circle of irrespon
sible acquaintances, would be un
able to run in a myriad of votes.
Under this provision, the ballots
cast would be, to say the least, in
telligently given.
