# CHANGES AND PROMOTIONS
## Facts About the New University "Register" Which Will Appear at the End of the Semester. 
### 
On account of inability to get
the paper originally ordered the
University Register has been de
layed in publication, apd will not
be ready for distribution until just
before the close of the semester.
No startling changes will be noted

though in type, paper, and general
make-up it will be the most satis
factory edition yet issued.
The following faculty promotions
are noted: Acting Associate Pro
fessor Rolfe to be Associate Profes
sor of Greek; Instructors Snow,
Baum, Maddock, and Storey to he

Under Entrance Requirements
it will be noted that hereafter two
credits will be given for entrance
Spanish. Modifications of the his
tory note-book requirements, where
by the actual presentation of note
books may be avoided, has already
been noted in the Daily Palo
Alto. A new provision by the
Faculty Committee on Admission
assures candidates who have ful
filled the requirements of the Mid
dle West state universities of ad
mission to the University. This
provision also includes those who
have fulfilled the requirements of
Group 111 or Group IV of the Uni
versity of California. Provision is
also made for the admission of
graduates of various Japanese
schools without examination ex
cept in English Composition. Va
rious cases in which the supple
mentary tests required of recom
mended students will be waived,
are stated at length. Thus these
tests will be waived in English,
French, and German for those who
pass the entrance examinations of
certain specified universities, or of
the College Entrance Examination
Board for the Middle States and
Maryland; in Physics and ad
vanced Greek when accredited by
certain universities, or by the Col
lege Entrance Examination Board.
The provisions for the admission
from California State Normal
Schools (without examination ex
cept in English Composition) has
been extended to other State Nor
mal Schools of equivalent rank.
Under Courses of Instruction
there are the usual variations and
changes. The major requirements
in English have been materially
changed. The only prescribed
courses are Chaucer, Shakspere,
18th Century Literature, and the
History of English Literature. "A
sound knowledge of at least one
foreign language and its literature"
takes the place of the former re
quirement of three foreign lan
guages. Anglo-Saxon and two for
eign languages will still be a
prerequisite to candidacy for an ad
vanced degree. Two new provi

sions are noted under Hygiene: one,
that all students upon matricula
tion must report for medical exam
ination of eyes and general health;
the other, that students training
for athletic teams or taking gym
nasium work must report for such
examination at the beginning of
each semester. The work in Hy
giene for the coming year will be
in charge of Assistant Professor
Snow, now absent on leave and
studying in the Johns Hopkins
Medical School.
The description of the Museum
is made more complete and brought
down to date. There is a brief de
scription of the Memorial Church,
and the Rev. R. Heber Newton,
D. D., is announced as minister.
The student list contains 1294
names, a falling off of 95 from the
previous year.
