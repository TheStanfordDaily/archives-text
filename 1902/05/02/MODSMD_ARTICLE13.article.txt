Thk editor of the 1903 Blue and
Gold could hardly hope to vie with
the editor of the Chaparral as a
proofreader, but it is a noteworthy
fact that of the few typographical
errors in California's annual, two
instances should concern Stanford.
We hope that a feeling of animos
ity on the part of the editor was
not responsible for the statement
in "Concerning Colleges" that Stan
ford has but thirty-four instructors,
or that California won the second
game of last year's Intercollegiate
baseball series.
