The movement of the Library for
making a complete collection of
Stanford posters, souvenir pro
grams, etc., merits the co-operation
of every student in the University,
and of every alumnus. The me
mentoes of the early days of the
University are now largely in the
hands of graduates, making it im
portant for members of the Alumni
to interest themselves in this col
lection. Meanwhile, undergrad
uates who have more than one copy
of any poster or program of later
date can, without inconvenience,
as√üistin making what will be one of
the most interesting corners in the
Library.
