# The 						Sierra Club's Outings.
## 
### 
The Sierra Club has planned a
number of outings for the summer.
The principal excursion will be to
the King's River Canon and the
high Sierra eastward, leaving San
Francisco, June 23d, by rail for
Sanger. The club will take charge
of an outing to the Grand Canon
of the Colorado and nighboring
points of interest, leaving San
Francisco about July 14th. It has
also obtained reduced rates for its
members who wish to go to Yosem
ity Valley during June, July, and
August. The advantages connected
with the first two are: reduced
traveling expenses —about thirty
per cent less than the usual rates —
the select company, —Sierra Club
members and those recommended
by members, —and a relief from
cooking and packing, and other
burdens of camp-life. Mr. John
Muir, the distinguished president
of the Sierra Club; Dr. Hart Mer
riam, United States Biological Sur
vey; Henry Gannett, United States
Geological Survey; and Professor
Lawson and Professor J. N. Le
Conte of the University of Califor
nia, will probably be with the
King's River party. Any person
in ordinary health, and a fair
walker, can take either of these trips
with safety and pleasure.
After leaving Millwood, the end
of the stage line, the King's River
expedition will be wholly a camp
ing excursion, and will continue
for the Bpace of four weeks if mem
bers desire to stay so long. The
entire expense of this excursion for
each person, including round-trip
railroad and stage fare between San
Francisco and Millwood, and living
expenses in camp for four weeks,
the packing of baggage, etc., is esti
mated at $45. Already about a
hundred names are registered for
this excursion. All will walk
through the forest from Millwood
to King's River Canon, and to the
permanent camp, a distance of
about forty miles, consuming three
days or more. The mountaineers
will ascend to the sources of the
Bubb's Creek branch of the river
and climb Mt. Brewer, one of the
best view points in the Sierras. Mr.
Colby, the secretary of the Club,
will manage the excursion to the
King's River.
Mr. John Chetwood,the attorney,
well known to the members of the
Club, will take charge of the Grand
Canon excursion, which is of quite
a different character from the
Sierra trip. The railroad takes
you to the brink of the canon, and
hotels are situated so near the at
tractive points that the whole may
be a hotel journey; although Mr.
Chetwood will see that those who
wish may camp in the vicinity of
the canon. He estimates the ex
penses of this trip, including rail
road, living expenses en route, the
same at the canon for over a week,
as well as sleeper both ways, to be
about $75 if his party numbers

fifty, or if it is much smaller, be
tween $80 and $90. This, however,
is a reduction of about 30 per cent
from the usual cost.
None of the Sierra Club "out
ings" savor of the personally or
commercially conducted excursions.
The services of all are generously
given for the encouragement of
mountain-climbing. Further infor
mation may be obtained from the
circulars (a few may be found at
the Botanical laboratory, room
150), or by writing to Mr. Colby,
Merchant's Exchange building, San
Francisco.
The names of those in each party
will be given to the managers of
the expedition before Ma}' 15th.
