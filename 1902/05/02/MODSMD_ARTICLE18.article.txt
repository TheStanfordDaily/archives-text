The Hon. Frank Murasky, who
acted as one of the judges of the
California-Stanford debate last
Saturday night, has written a
member of the Intercollegiate De
bating Committee as follows:
"The pleasure of listening to the
debate on Saturday evening last
was more than sufficient gratifica
tion to repay any service we may
have rendered. I assure you, in
all earnestness, that there were
among the speakers some future
Delmases and Garbers. The atten
tion now being devoted —and which
for a long period was lacking—by
our universities and colleges to the
culture of the powers of persuasion
is bearing good fruit."
