# Pacific Academic League Meet.
## 
### 
Interest in the athletics in Santa
Clara county at present is centered
in the Pacific Academic League
meet to he held tomorrow afternoon
in the Agricultural Park in San
Jose, commencing at 2 o'clock.
This league is composed of the
high schools of the county, Palo

Alto, SanJo√üe, Santa Clara, Camp
bell, and Los Gatos, and the Uni
versity of the Pacific. The cham
pionship last year was won by San
Jose with a strong team, most of
which is still on the track. Santa
Clara and Campbell, however, are
in better condition. San Jose has
Cocher, their captain, to make
competition in the high jump, pole
vault, hammer-throw, and shot
put, and Maloy in the distances.
Santa Clara will depend on Hay
ward, who won the two-twenty last
year for San Jose, to win first place
in both the hundred and two
twenty for Santa Clara this year,
and Titus is expected to get posi
tions in both the high jump and
pole-vault. Campbell has a man
whose performances would indicate
some record-breaking work in the
mile. The University of the Pacific
has been working hard, and expects
to make a far better showing than
last year.
The officials for the meet are
nearly all Stanford men: Starter,
A. E. Henley, '04; timers, T. L.
Storey, Dr. Frank Angell, Trainer
E. W. Moulton; judges, W. A.
Crossman, '04, H. L. Hamilton, '04,
