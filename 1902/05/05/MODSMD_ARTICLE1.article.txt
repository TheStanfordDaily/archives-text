# DEBATE WAS A TIE.
## Absence of a Third Judge Left the Washing ton-Stanford Contest Undecided. 
### 
The first tie in the history of
Stanford debuting—such was the
outcome of the first debate with
Washington. One of the judges,
Mr. A. C. Freeman, was not pres
ent Friday evening, and the other
two, Judge VV. P. Law lor and Mr.
lfi. B. Learning, were unable to come
to an agreement on the decision.
Before announcing the result of the
contest the judges called into con
sultation \\. T. Laube and E. W.
Itiee, of (he opposing teams, and
proposed the expedient of pressing
into service some third person from
the audience, whose decision should
be agreeable to all. But after
further consideration it was deemed
best, for obvious reasons, to leave
the outcome with the two judges.
The debate was an excellent one
from every point of view. The
Washington team presented a well
arranged argument; the work of W.
T. Luuhe, the leader of the aflirma
live, was particularly noteworthy.
The Stanford team showed unity
and team work, and presented a
case which was throughout consist
ent and logical. In form the Stan
ford speakers were better than the
Washington tenm, but Washington
Inid the stronger and more popular
side of the question.
The visitors arrived at the Uni
versity at noon Friday, and were
entertained for lunch and dinner ai
the I'bi Delta Theta house. Mc-
Donald later went to the Sigma Nu
house and Laube to Eneina.
The crowd which appeared at As
sembly Hall at. 8 o'clock Friday
evening was disappointingly small,
so that adjournment was made to
the clnipel. Here about fifty Stan
ford rooters occupied a portion of
the seats on the left side, and yelled
for Washington and Stanford im
partially. The visiting team was
greeted with its own throat-splitting
slogan:
(]. of W.! Hiah! Hiah!
U. of W.! Siah! Siah!
Skookum! Skookum!
Washington!
This was immediately followed
by the Stanford yell, and as each
man rose to speak he was given an
individual cheer. The question
discussed was the now familiar one
of Negro Suffrage. Washington
supported the affirmative with Will
T. Laube, Howard A. Hanson, and
Donald McDonald; Stanford sup
ported the negative with L. L. Loof
bourow, '02, O. H. Hitter, '04, and
E. W. Rice, '02. Each speaker
was allowed twenty minutes, with
the exception of the first affirma
tive, who divided twenty-five min
utes between his first speech and
rebuttal. Professor B. E. Howard
presided.
The Arguments.
Laube opened the case for the
affirmative, lie stated the ques
tion and the altitude of the affirm
ative clearly and weli. He held
that the Fifteenth Amendment was
"no race discrimination," and that,
this meant impartial and not uni
versal suffrage. I'he experience of
Europe teaches that educational

and property qualifications are the
only just discriminations. Partial
suffrage works an injustice on tlie
white as well as the black man. |
in Mississippi an educational test :
has been put into operation, and!
proved very satisfactory to all I
classes of the population. Laube's
presence and delivery were agree
able, and his argument was well
constructed.
Loofbourow followed for the neg
ative with an excellent statement
of its point of view, lie avoided
quibbling on the interpretation of
the spirit of the Amendment by ad
mitting that the affirmative could
choose to uphold either unrestricted
suffrnge, or discrimination by an
educational or property test. The
condition of the South today, must
be taken into account in a consider
ation of the subject. Negroes in the
South are satisfied with their pres
ent condition, although they have
been practically disfranchised for
yearn This disfranchisement has
been brought about by an effort of
the indignant white South to
overthrow the mistaken legis
lation of Northern politicians,
and yet all the progress which
the negro has made has been
under this very disfranchisement.
The feeling of the South is inevit
able, and one cannot legislate it
from without. It is like local feel
ing toward the Chinese. Loof
bourow is a smooth, easy, fluent
speaker, who never stumbles or hesi
tates for a word. His argument
was ingenious. It presented a dif
ficult position in the most favorable
iight possible.
Hanson, the next speaker for the
affirmative, quoted l)u Hois and
other leading negro authorities to
show that the negro was not satis
fied with his present position in
the South, lie brought out the
educational value of the suffrage
and reiterated the idea of his col
league that suffrage must be based
on justice. An impartial test, such
as that by which the race problem
is solved in Mississippi, excludes
the unlit of both races. The negro,
on the whole, has shown his fitness
by his physical, mental, and in
dustrial capacity. On grounds of
expediency, the effect of race dis
crimination upon both whites and
negroes is bad. There is great
danger to a country in the posses
sion of a body of freedmen without
the suffrage. Hanson's argument,
one of the strongest of the debate,
was marred by a slight nervous
ness and lack of aggressive force.
Hitter delivered for the negative
a speech which was commendable
for the amount of material it con
tained. He contended that the
negro can never harmonize with
his white neighbor because he be
longs to a different and inferior
clans. The voting level of the low
est white is the same as that of the
highest negro. Negro suffrage
during Reconstruction days inten
sified race hatred Since then the
blacks have been struggling to ad
vance, but their progress has been
extensive rather than intensive.
The negro voter has been respon
sible for the division of parties
along race lines for the Solid South.
He has promulgated sectionalism
between North and South, and dis
couraged the investment of North
ern capital. Hitter closed with a
.summary of the first negative
speech, as well as his own. His
argument was logically constructed.
McDonald closed the aflirmative
case. He began his speech with
some rebuttal of the negative's
points. He then argued on grounds
of general public policy,- holding
that the race problem must be
solved with an eye to the future of
the country. "Either the while
must lift the negro up, or the negro
will drag the white down. Well
has it been said that the suffrage
is the sword and shield of our law.
If the negro is given the right to
vote, there will be no more race
prejudice. The destiny of the whole
nation is involved in the proper
solution of this question. The prin
ciple of the aflirmative is the prin
ciple of free government with the
consent of the governed, equality of
opportunity, and the Declaration
of Independence."
llice concluded the debate for
the negative with one of the best
speeches that has ever been deliv
ered on a Stanford rostrum. His
presentation was eminently logical
and straightforward. It had unity,
harmonized with the arguments of
his two colleagues, and with them
presented a clearly well propor
tioned case for the negative. Rice's
manner and delivery were sincere
and judicial, appealing to the con
fidence of his hearers. He argued
for race discrimination from the
point of view of the negro, contend
ing that the negro's own welfare le-;
manded that the right to vote
should be for the present withheld
from him. The aflirmative had con
sidered not typical negroes,but only
the Booker T. Washingtons. The
black race is not prosperous, nor
from the standpoint of their own
well-being able to vote. A property
qualification is not a good test for
aflirmative to uphold because such
a test would disfranchise almost all
the negroes in the South, and thusj
be contrary to the spirit of the Pif-'
teenth Amendment. An educa
tional qualification is not a good
test because its only basis is the;
mere ability to read and write, the!
kind of education which sinks no!
deeper than the color of the black
man's skin. Mississippi is not ai
good example to support this test, |
because in that State the regula
tion of the franchise lies wholly
within the discriminating power of
the whites. "In the hand of a
child the sword and shield is of lit-.
tie value. Let the white South
solve its own problem."
Laube delivered the rebuttal
speech for Washington. He spoke [
readily and with considerable force, I
presenting a large amount of evi- |
deuce of the negro's good citizenship
and his ability to vote, and closing
with a brief summary of the aflirm
ative position.
After deliberation for the space
of twenty minutes the drawn de
cision \va« announced by Judge
Lawlor. Thus the privilege was
given to both universities of saying
that they did not lose the first inter
collegiate contest between Washing
ton and Stanford.

other leading negro authorities to
show that the negro was not satis
fied with his present position in
the South, lie brought out the
educational value of the suffrage
and reiterated the idea of his col
league that suffrage must be based
on justice. An impartial test, such
as that by which the race problem
is solved in Mississippi, excludes
the unlit of both races. The negro,
on the whole, has shown his fitness
by his physical, mental, and in
dustrial capacity. On grounds of
expediency, the effect of race dis
crimination upon both whites and
negroes is bad. There is great
danger to a country in the posses
sion of a body of freedmen without
the suffrage. Hanson's argument,
one of the strongest of the debate,
was marred by a slight nervous
ness and lack of aggressive force.
Hitter delivered for the negative
a speech which was commendable
for the amount of material it con
tained. He contended that the
negro can never harmonize with
his white neighbor because he be
longs to a different and inferior
clans. The voting level of the low
est white is the same as that of the
highest negro. Negro suffrage
during Reconstruction days inten
sified race hatred Since then the
blacks have been struggling to ad
vance, but their progress has been
extensive rather than intensive.
The negro voter has been respon
sible for the division of parties
along race lines for the Solid South.
He has promulgated sectionalism
between North and South, and dis
couraged the investment of North
ern capital. Hitter closed with a
.summary of the first negative
speech, as well as his own. His
argument was logically constructed.
McDonald closed the aflirmative
case. He began his speech with
some rebuttal of the negative's
points. He then argued on grounds
of general public policy,- holding
that the race problem must be
solved with an eye to the future of
the country. "Either the while
must lift the negro up, or the negro
will drag the white down. Well
has it been said that the suffrage
is the sword and shield of our law.
If the negro is given the right to
vote, there will be no more race
prejudice. The destiny of the whole
nation is involved in the proper
solution of this question. The prin
ciple of the aflirmative is the prin
ciple of free government with the
consent of the governed, equality of
opportunity, and the Declaration
of Independence."
llice concluded the debate for
the negative with one of the best
speeches that has ever been deliv
ered on a Stanford rostrum. His
presentation was eminently logical
and straightforward. It had unity,
harmonized with the arguments of
his two colleagues, and with them
presented a clearly well propor
tioned case for the negative. Rice's
manner and delivery were sincere
and judicial, appealing to the con
fidence of his hearers. He argued
for race discrimination from the
point of view of the negro, contend
ing that the negro's own welfare le-;
manded that the right to vote
should be for the present withheld
from him. The aflirmative had con
sidered not typical negroes,but only
the Booker T. Washingtons. The
black race is not prosperous, nor
from the standpoint of their own
well-being able to vote. A property
qualification is not a good test for
aflirmative to uphold because such
a test would disfranchise almost all
the negroes in the South, and thusj
be contrary to the spirit of the Pif-'
teenth Amendment. An educa
tional qualification is not a good
test because its only basis is the;
mere ability to read and write, the!
kind of education which sinks no!
deeper than the color of the black
man's skin. Mississippi is not ai
good example to support this test, |
because in that State the regula
tion of the franchise lies wholly
within the discriminating power of
the whites. "In the hand of a
child the sword and shield is of lit-.
tie value. Let the white South
solve its own problem."
Laube delivered the rebuttal
speech for Washington. He spoke [
readily and with considerable force, I
presenting a large amount of evi- |
deuce of the negro's good citizenship
and his ability to vote, and closing
with a brief summary of the aflirm
ative position.
After deliberation for the space
of twenty minutes the drawn de
cision \va« announced by Judge
Lawlor. Thus the privilege was
given to both universities of saying
that they did not lose the first inter
collegiate contest between Washing
ton and Stanford.
The first tie in the history of
Stanford debuting—such was the
outcome of the first debate with
Washington. One of the judges,
Mr. A. C. Freeman, was not pres
ent Friday evening, and the other
two, Judge VV. P. Law lor and Mr.
lfi. B. Learning, were unable to come
to an agreement on the decision.
Before announcing the result of the
contest the judges called into con
sultation \\. T. Laube and E. W.
Itiee, of (he opposing teams, and
proposed the expedient of pressing
into service some third person from
the audience, whose decision should
be agreeable to all. But after
further consideration it was deemed
best, for obvious reasons, to leave
the outcome with the two judges.
The debate was an excellent one
from every point of view. The
Washington team presented a well
arranged argument; the work of W.
T. Luuhe, the leader of the aflirma
live, was particularly noteworthy.
The Stanford team showed unity
and team work, and presented a
case which was throughout consist
ent and logical. In form the Stan
ford speakers were better than the
Washington tenm, but Washington
Inid the stronger and more popular
side of the question.
The visitors arrived at the Uni
versity at noon Friday, and were
entertained for lunch and dinner ai
the I'bi Delta Theta house. Mc-
Donald later went to the Sigma Nu
house and Laube to Eneina.
The crowd which appeared at As
sembly Hall at. 8 o'clock Friday
evening was disappointingly small,
so that adjournment was made to
the clnipel. Here about fifty Stan
ford rooters occupied a portion of
the seats on the left side, and yelled
for Washington and Stanford im
partially. The visiting team was
greeted with its own throat-splitting
slogan:
(]. of W.! Hiah! Hiah!
U. of W.! Siah! Siah!
Skookum! Skookum!
Washington!
This was immediately followed
by the Stanford yell, and as each
man rose to speak he was given an
individual cheer. The question
discussed was the now familiar one
of Negro Suffrage. Washington
supported the affirmative with Will
T. Laube, Howard A. Hanson, and
Donald McDonald; Stanford sup
ported the negative with L. L. Loof
bourow, '02, O. H. Hitter, '04, and
E. W. Rice, '02. Each speaker
was allowed twenty minutes, with
the exception of the first affirma
tive, who divided twenty-five min
utes between his first speech and
rebuttal. Professor B. E. Howard
presided.
The Arguments.
Laube opened the case for the
affirmative, lie stated the ques
tion and the altitude of the affirm
ative clearly and weli. He held
that the Fifteenth Amendment was
"no race discrimination," and that,
this meant impartial and not uni
versal suffrage. I'he experience of
Europe teaches that educational

and property qualifications are the
only just discriminations. Partial
suffrage works an injustice on tlie
white as well as the black man. |
in Mississippi an educational test :
has been put into operation, and!
proved very satisfactory to all I
classes of the population. Laube's
presence and delivery were agree
able, and his argument was well
constructed.
Loofbourow followed for the neg
ative with an excellent statement
of its point of view, lie avoided
quibbling on the interpretation of
the spirit of the Amendment by ad
mitting that the affirmative could
choose to uphold either unrestricted
suffrnge, or discrimination by an
educational or property test. The
condition of the South today, must
be taken into account in a consider
ation of the subject. Negroes in the
South are satisfied with their pres
ent condition, although they have
been practically disfranchised for
yearn This disfranchisement has
been brought about by an effort of
the indignant white South to
overthrow the mistaken legis
lation of Northern politicians,
and yet all the progress which
the negro has made has been
under this very disfranchisement.
The feeling of the South is inevit
able, and one cannot legislate it
from without. It is like local feel
ing toward the Chinese. Loof
bourow is a smooth, easy, fluent
speaker, who never stumbles or hesi
tates for a word. His argument
was ingenious. It presented a dif
ficult position in the most favorable
iight possible.
Hanson, the next speaker for the
affirmative, quoted l)u Hois and
other leading negro authorities to
show that the negro was not satis
