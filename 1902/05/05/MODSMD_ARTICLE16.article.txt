# PHŒNIX UNIVERSITY CLUB.
## Description and Membership List of Unique Arizona Alumni Association. 
### 
A University Club of some thirty
members has lately been formed in
Phoenix, Arizona. Projected by
Oliver P. Morton, of the Stanford
Pioneer class, but drawing its mem
bership largely from Eastern col
lege men, it constitutes one of the
most unique alumni organizations
in the country. Phoenix Univer
sity Club has no rooms now, nor
any regular attendance. On tt
given Saturday evening—and the
meetings are usually three weeks
apart —such miners, engineers, doc
tors, lawyers, soldiers as are within
riding distance of the capital, get
together at the famous restaurant
of "Coffee Al" Williams, where a
banquet-room has been reserved.
At the first gathering of all an elab
orate supper of eight courses was
discussed. Since then by popular
consent there has been a less exten
sive bill of fare. The plentiful
but plain Dutch supper is now a
feature of the meetings. The men
bring their own steins and pipes,
but a box of Internationals is al
ways handy for those who prefer
Mexican cigars.
The spirit of the meetings is
Western, but essentially college
spirit. Probably no other town of
the same size can show such a rep
resentative body of college men,
young men who have been more
uniformly successful in the life of
the great Southwest.
