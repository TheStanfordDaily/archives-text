### 
In Germany educational boards
are waking up to the advantages <>112
co-education, says, the Boston Tran
script, and at a recent convention
of the public school teachers of
Westphalia tne following resolu
tions were adopted:
First —The aim of the public
school is the same for both sexes.
Second —Although theindividual
talents of the sexes are different,
and require different treatment, a
one-sided cultivation of them nny
easily create an unnatural chasm
between boys and girls, so it seems
desirable to educate them together.
Third — Another reason for co
education io the public schools is
that, although the two sexes will
hold different positions in after life,
yet life brings them face to face
with the same problems.

Fourth —The different degree of
interest taken in different branches
by boys and girls may prove ad
vantageous to both.
Fifth —The habit of daily associa
tion with the opposite sex tends to
diminish the moral dangers of
growing boys and girls.
Sixth —Co-education is the most
natural system, because it is most
like education in the family.
The public school teachers of
Wurtemberg, at another meeting,
declared that "for the sake of a
more advantageous organization of
the schools, small communities
should not found separate schools
for boys and girls." Baden and
Wurtemburg, from this time, will
admit girls to the boys' prepara
tory schools on passing the entrance
examination.
