### 
In the Pacific Academic League
meet at San Jose on Saturday the
Santa Clara high school athletes
won by a good margin. The final
score was: Santa Clara 75, San
Jose 54, Campbell 37, Uuiversity of
the Pacific Academy 6.
A great deal of enthusiasm was
shown by supporters of the rival
teams. Some of the athletes dis
played considerable ability, and
need only a little training in order
to make first-class performers.
Lovell of the Campbell high school
in both the mile, 4:50 1-5, and the
half, 2:21 1-5; Hayward in the
hundred, 10 4-5, and the two
twenty, 23 1-5; Stuart in the fifty,
:05 4-5; and Anderson in the four
forty, :54, each did excellent work,
and will improve if they remain on
the track for another year. In the
field events, Kocher of San Jose and
Titus of Santa Clara seemed to be
in good form and made very fail
showing. Kocher was the best of
the San Jose men, taking first
places in the pole-vault at
the shot-put at feet, and
the hammer-throw at 109 feet.
Titus won the high jump at 5 feet
inches, and the broad jump at
18 feet 11 inches. The two-mile
went to Hunter of Santa Clara in
11:16 2-5, the high hurdles to Hill
of San Jose in:17 3-5, the low hur
dles to Roll of Santa Clara in:28.
The mile relay with eight men
