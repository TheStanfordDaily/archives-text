# WILL ENLARGE THE MUSEUM.
## Additional Structures to be Started During the Summer.â€”Capacity Doubled. 
### 
Plans have been prepared by
Architect Hodges for additions and
extensions to the Museum which
will more than double the present
floor area and capacity. Contract
ors are now figuring on the pro
posed work, and it is expected that
the improvements will be started
this coming summer vacation. The
new buildings that are to be put
up number six or eight, and make
the work one of the most import
ant and comprehensive improve
ments started at Stanford this
year.
There are to be a number of addi
tions like the two last ones erected,
wicii are to be constructed in the
shape of a polygon enclosing a
large court. Connecting the pres
ent wings two circular dome
crowned structures are to be put
up, and at right angles to these, on
both sides, are to run buildings to
connect with the rear row of wings.
The continuous length of the rear
additions is to be about six hun
dred and fifty feet, corresponding to
the facade of the present Museum.
All the structures will be two
stories high, and in order to carry
out the architectural rules as orig
inally planned they are to be con
structed of stuccoed brick, making
the completed Museum exactly like
the wings built two years ago,
which were recently opened for ex
hibits. These additions will pro
vide room for several large exhib
its Mrs. Stanford has bought and
which have remained packed be
cause of lack of suitable accommo
dations. The floor area, when the
contemplated improvements are
finished, will furnish space for
years to come, and the Museum
will be among the largest in the
United States.
