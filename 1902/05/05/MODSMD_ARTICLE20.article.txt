# Berkeley Athletes Start East.
## 
### 
The University of California
track team left Berkeley last week
on their trip East to meet the lead
ing teams in the country. The
party consisted of Graduate Mana
ger Ezra W. Decoto, Trainer Wal
ter Christie, Captain Edward M.
Hussey, Alfred D. Flaw, R. Roy
Service, Anthony Cadogan, William
A. Powell, John A. Wilcox, Her
bert C. Cheek, Fraucis H. Rede
well, Edward Topham, Emile Ab
adie, and Sidney R. Tibbetts.
The men, with the exception of
Cadogan, are in good condition.
The long trip will Undoubtedly
affect their form, but they will be
given opportunity to limber up as
often as possible on the road. Five
days will be allowed for rest be
tween their arrival at New Haven
and the first meet with Yale. It is
thought that this enforced rest will
be beneficial to Cadogan, who is
suffering from a split muscle, in
jured in the Stanford meet.
This is the third team that Cali

fornia has sent East. The first
one in 1895 beat Princeton and
Union college, tied Pennsylvania,
and won fourth place at the Amer
ican Intercollegiate meet.
The 1900 team was not so fortu
nate, failing to win a single victory.
The trip resulted, however, in the
acquisition of Walter Christie, who
has been instrumental in building
up this year's team.
