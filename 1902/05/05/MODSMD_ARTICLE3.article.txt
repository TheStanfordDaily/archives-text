# The
						Rev. Brewer's Sermon.
## 
### 
The ilev. W. A. Brewer of San
Mateo preached in the chapel Sun
day and chose for bis theme ''The
Mighty Ten Years, 1 ' which he said
are those years immediately pre
ceding the step from youth into
manhood. Mr. Brewer gave a brief
outline of this period in the life of
Christ and showed the necessity ex
isting for the youth of the present
generation to be moved, as far as
possible, by the same influences
which acted upon the Master.
After developing the value ex
ercised by home influences, the
speaker showed that, in the ab
sence of these, the place should be
filled by those of some good school.
He closed with a deep-felt appeal
for encouragement and help for
schools of this character by all in
terested in the moral, mental, and
spiritual welfare of the rising gen
eration.
