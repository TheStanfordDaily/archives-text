So far as the debate itself was
concerned, the contest with the
University of Washington last Fri
day evening was eminently success
ful. Both teams handled the ques
tion skilfully. The Stanford men
surpassed themselves and worked
in perfect harmony. The cases pre
sented on each side were consistent,
straightforward, and logical. The
visitors proved to be worthy rivals.
A commendable spirit was shown
in all the speeches. The only un
satisfactory feature of the actual
contest resulted from the circum
stances which prevented a decision
from being reached as to the result.
In striking contrast to the spirit
shown by the contestants was the
scantiness of the audience. The
small attendance offered a deplor
able comment on the lack of inter
est taken by the student body.
Whether or not one cared for de
bating, loyalty to our men who
have worked for months to repre
sent the University with credit, as
well as courtesy to the visitors who
came a thousand miles to open in
tercollegiate relations with a sister
Coast institution, demanded a
larger crowd. The failure of a
crowd to turn out may have been
caused largely by the charge of ad
mission, which is an innovation for
debating here. If this is the case,
it would have been far better not to
have made any charge, since the
receipts in no degree compensated
for the loss of auditors and enthus
iasm, and contributed but little to
the payment of expenses. It seems
that debating is not so popular
that people are willing to pay
for hearing it. Still, it is an im- j
portant branch of student activity,
one that must always be main

taiued and encouraged. The yell
ing done Friday night was generous
and spirited, but it lacked the
volume of numbers. Let Stanford
take this fora lesson never to allow
such a small attendance at another
intercollegiate contest.
