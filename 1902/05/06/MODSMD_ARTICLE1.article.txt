### 
President Jordan spoke at the
convention of the General Federa
tion of Women's Chilis at Los An
geles last evening on the "Educa
tion of Women.' 1 Miss L. J. Mar
tin, of the Psychology department,
discussed "Art for Children, from
the Standpoint of Psychology."
A condensed report of Dr. .Jor
dan's address is here reproduced
from today's Call:
The subject of higher training
of young women may resolve itself
into three questions:
1. Shall a girl receive a college
e location ?
2. Sha 11 she receive t he same kind
of a college education as a hoy?
3. Shall she he educated in the
same col lege?
As to the first question: It must
depend on the character of the girl.
Precisely so with the boy. What
we should do with either depends
on his or her possibilities. No par
ent should let either boy or girl
enter life with any less preparation
than I he best they can give.
Two. Shall we give our girls the
same education as our boys?
Yes and no. If we mean the
same, an equal degree of breadth
and thoroughness, an equal fitness
for high thinking and wise acting;
yes, let it be tlie same. If we mean
this: Shall we reach this end by
exactly the same course of studies?
then my answer must lie no, for the
same course of study will not yield
the same results with different per
sons. The ordinary "collegecourse,"
which has been handed down from
generation to generation, is purely
conventional. The great educa
tional awakening of the last twenty
years in America has lain in break
ing the bonds of this old system.
The essence of new education is
constructive individualism, lis pur
pose is to give to each young man
that training which will make a
man of him. Not the training
which a century or two ago helped
to civilize the mass of boys of that
time, but that which will civilize
this particular hoy.
An institution which meets the
varied needs of varied men can also
meet, the varied needs of varied
women. The intellectual needs of
the two classes are not very differ
ent in many important respects. In
so far as these a re different, theelec
tive system gives full play for the
expression of such differences.
Three. Shall women be taught in
the same classes as men?
This is partly a matter of taste
or personal preference. It does no
harm whatever to either men or
women to meet those of the other
sex in the same class-rooms. Con
siderable has been said for and
against the union of one institution
of technical schools and schools of
liberal arts. But 1 believe better
men are made when the two are
brought more closely together.
A woman's college is more or less
distinctly a technical school. It is
a school of training for the profes
sion of womanhood. It encourages
womanliness of thought as more or
less different from the plain think
ing which is called manly. The

brightest work in woman's colleges
is often accompanied by a nervous
strain, as though the doer were fear
ful of falling short of some outside
standard. The best work of men
is natural, is unconscious, the nor
mal result of the contact of the
mind with the problem in question.
In this direction, I think, lies the
strongest argument for coeducation.
This argument is especially cogent
in institutions in which the indi
viduality of the student is recog
nized and respected. In such
schools each man by bis relation to
action and realities becomes a
teacher of woman in these regards,
as in other ways each cultivated
woman is a. teacher of men.
In women's education as planned
for women alone the tendency is
toward the study of beauty and
oriler. Literature and language
take precedence over science. The
educated woman is likely to master
technique rather than art; method
rather than »substance. She may
know a good deal, but she can do
nothing.
In schools for men alone the re
verse condition often obtains. The
sense of reality obscures the ele
ments of beauty and fitness. It is
of great advantage to both men and
women to meet on a plane of equal
ity in education. Women are
brought, into contact with men who
can do things —men in whom the
sense of reality is strong, and who
have definite views of life. This
influence affects them for good.
In like manner the association
with wise, sane, and healthy women
has its value for young men. This
value has never been fully realized,
even by the strongest advocates of
coeducation. It raises their ideal
of womanhood, and the highest
manhood must he associated with
such an ideal.
A final question: Does coeduca
tion lead to marriage? Most cer
tainly it does, and this fact cannot
he and need not he denied. The
wonder is rather that there are not
more of such marriages. It is a
constant surprise that so many
college men turn from their col
lege associates and marry some
earlier or later acquaintance of in
ferior ability, inferior training and
often inferior personal charm. The
marriages which result from col
lege association are not usually
premature, and it is certainly true
that no better marriages can be
made than those founded on com
mon interests and intellectual
friendship.
A college man who has known
college women as a rule is not
drawn to those of lower ideals and
inferior training. His choice is
likely to be led toward the best he
has known. A college woman is
not led by mere propinquity to ac
cept the attentions of inferior men.
