According to the announcement
made in the new register, all per
sons doing athletic work at tlie
University will in the future be re
quired to report for a medical ex
amination at the beginning of each
semester. Up to the present time
only men registered for Gymnas
ium courses have been subjected
to the examination. Those who
have worked on teams independent
ly, have not been apprised of their
condition and have not known
what they were able to stand, un
less they had been examined on
their own account. The new re
quirement is similar to rules en
forced at many Eastern universi
ties, and will prevent the recur
rence of sad accidents, such as we
have seen during this year.
