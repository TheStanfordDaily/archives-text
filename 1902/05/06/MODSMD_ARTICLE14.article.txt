Under existing conditions, the
annual assessment of one dollar
per year levied on members of the
Associated Students is in no sense
an assessment but a mere volun
tary contribution. Unless it is
made to signify something moie,
it should be abolished. An equal
or perhaps larger amount of money
could be raised by general sub
scription, than is realized annually
by this method. At present there
is 110 way to enforce payment of the
dollar. It is not looked upon by
many students as an obligation,
and it fails to accomplish its pur
pose. Just now the funds derived
from this source are added to the
reserve for a training-house. Jf
training quarters and equipment
are provided in the new gymnas
ium, the accumulation will be
turned over to meet the annual de
ficit,or tosomeother end equally im
portant for the student hody.
But, while the assessment is par

tially intended to produce revenue,
its main value should he to give the
members of the student community
some sense of interest and respon
sibility in undergraduate affairs.
If the ballot is allowed to those
only who have paid their dollar,
the right to vote will be regarded
as a privilege and will be exercised
with care. Atone of the institu
tions on the Coast, with a registra
tion of less than five hundred, the
assessment of $3.50 is paid by
nearly three-fourths of the stu
dents, who otherwise have not the
right to vote. At some Eastern
universities the tax is much larger
than at Stanford —at Yale it is
$7.00 — and at others where no
assessment is levied large sums are
raised by voluntary subscription,
as at Wisconsin, where the crews
are maintained by contributions.
At Stanford the Junior class levies
anassessment, and those who refuse
to pay it are not given a place in the
Quad gallery of pictures. Seniors
who refuse to meet the demand of
their class receive no commence
ment week programs. The assess
ment of the Associated Students is
alone subject to voluntary action.
The man who refuses to pay now
has as much privilege as the one
who contributes. The only appar
ent gain by the donor of a dollar
is the satisfaction he may give a
well-trained conscience with the
knowledge of having discharged a
duty.
If this is an assessment, it should
be made so by amending the con
stitution before next year. The
time for action is growing short,
and the Executive Committee,
which meets tomorrow evening,
should bring the subject before the
student body.
