# Fire Drill Progress.

The time made by the fire sec
tions of Encina gymnasium yes
terday in getting the cart from be
hind Professor Dudley's house on
Alvarado row, and starting a stream
at Encina hall, was for the 10:15
class 6:30, for the 11:15 class 6:05,
for the 4 o'clock class 6:05,
for the 5 o'clock class 4:40.
This is good time considering
the distance to the connections
and the weight of the cart. As
there is considerable rivalry be
tween the classes the record will
probably be lowered.
