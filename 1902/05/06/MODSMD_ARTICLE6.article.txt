# Bret Harte Is Dead.
## 
### 
F. Bret Harte, the author, died
last night from hemorrhage at
Ohamberley, near Aldershot, Eng
land. The hemorrhage was caused
by a throat affection. Mr. Harte
had been suffering from swelled
tonsils since December last, but he
did not consider the attack to be
serious. A week ago he went to
visit friends at Chamberlev, and
was present at lunch yesterday.
He suddenly became ill in the
afternoon, went to bed, and died in
a few hours. His end was peaceful.
