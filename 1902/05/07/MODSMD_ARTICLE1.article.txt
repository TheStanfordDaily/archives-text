The Senior Farce, "A Rank Out
sider," will be produced in the As
sembly Hall on the night of Thurs
day, May 22d, the date on which
instruction closes. R. J. Sterrett
was awarded the prize for the farce,
which is expected to excel in many
ways the excellent production of
Messrs. Erb and Bradley last year.
The plot is drawn from Stanford
life, and the many situations touch
ing on college scenes are active and
interesting. Rehearsals have been
successfully conducted for the last
two weeks. The cast of characters
has been drawn from the best
talent in the University, and a
large and practised chorus of about
forty voices will take part. Mrs. W.
If. Irwin, '98, the stage manager,
and Miss May Hurlburt, as musi
cal director, will devote all their
time from now on in drilling the
acting cast and the chorus. The
farce will be presented in three acts.
On Friday afternoon at 4 o'clock
President and Mrs. Jordan will
give an informal reception to the
graduating class. On that night
a Senior class smoker and recep
tion to the alumni and faculty will
be given by the men graduates.
The nature and character of this
affair has not been definitely de
cided. The Glee and Mandolin
Clubs will furnish the music, and a
few special stunts may be included.
It will be strictly a stag event,
somewhat of the nature of a fare
well party.
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
will not give their usual concert in
the Assembly Hall, owing to the
fact that it is hard tc keep in prac
tice throughout the year. The
Senior smoker will take the place
of the concert.
Saturday, May 24th, will be
Class Day. At 10:30 a m.the ex
ercises will be held in the chapel.
President Frank Hinman of the

Senior class will give a short ad
dress, after which the "Class Will"
will he read by J. K. Bonnell, and
the "History" by Miss M. E. Mc-
Dougal. An especially prepared
musical program will be rendered.
At 11:30 a.m. the 1902 plate will
be dedicated in the quadrangle.
Herbert Coffin Jones will deliver
the class oration, to which Presi
dent Jordan will reply. A class
song written especially for this ex
ercise by Miss Hazel Hope Web
ster will be sung by the Glee Clubs
and members of the class, and the
affair will be more in the nature of
a class memorial dedication than
formerly.
At 8:30 Saturday evening the
Senior reception to the faculty and
student body will be given in the
Encina club room. Yanke's or
chestra of ten pieces will furnish
music for the evening, and dancing
will begi naboutatten o'clock. The
affair will be entirely informal.
The program for Sunday is the
same as in former years with the
exception that there will be no
ivy- nor tree-planting. Since it is
evident that the ivy planted by
former classes has never been ap
preciated by their successors, and
since the plate exercises fill the need
of any memorial service by the
class it has been decided to leave
no other memento. At 11:00 a.m.
the Rev. Frederick W. Clampett,
rector of Trinity Church, San Fran
cisco, will deliver the Baccalaurate
Sermon in the Assembly Hall. At
7:45 in the evening the anniver
sary exercises of the Christian Asso
ciations will be held in the chapel.
At 10:30 a.m. on Monday the
Faculty-Senior baseball game will
be played. The Seniors will ap
pear in some ridiculous costume,
the make-up of which is strictly se
cret. At 8:30 in the evening will
occur the great social event of the
year, the Senior Ball, in the Encina
club-room. This will be the most
elaborate dance ever given at Stan
ford. Unusual care will be given
in the arrangement of the decora
tions, and the refreshments will be
more tastefully served than ever
before. Yanke's Orchestra of
twenty pieces will furnish the
music, which will be continuous.
A 'tringed band will play during
intermissions and throughout the
supper service.
Alumni Day will as usual be on
Tuesday. At 10:00 a.m. will be
the annual business meeting of the
Alumni, and at 11:00 a.m. the
Annual Alumni Meeting in the
chapel. The Alumni reunion and
luncheon will take place in Roble
Hall at 12:30 p.m. At 8 p.m. the
Promenade Concert will commence
in the quad. Yanke's Band of
forty-live pieces will play in a
covered bandstand in front of the
chapel. The quad will not be com
pletely inclosed with burlap this
year, but there will be the same
number of booths, and in addition
the Alumni will fit up a booth for
the special reception of all former
students and graduates who, after
leaving college for a few years,
usually find themselves among
strangers on their return.
The decoration effect will be
something unique. Electric lights
and Japanese lanterns will he
strung over the quad.
The musical program will bo
carefully selected, popular pieces
being especially sought for. In
addition to the regular number of
band pieces, the church organ will
be played during the greater num
ber of intermissions in the regular
program, so that there will be a
continuous concert.
The printed programs for all ex
ercises will he more costly and
elaborate than in any previous
year, and will he placed on sale be
fore and during the week.
Commencement exercises will
begin on Wednesday, May 28th, at
10:80 a.m., in Assembly Hall.
