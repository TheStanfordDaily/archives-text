# Antigone Again Tomorrow.
## 
### 
Tomorrow evening (Thursday)
the final performance of the Antig
one at the University will be given
in the Assembly Hall. The fact
that the cast and chorus have been
resting for a week promises to make
Thursday's presentation the best
one yet seen. The work will be
carefully gone over in rehearsal
again tonight. This third per
formance is given here in order to
allow members of the University
who failed to attend previously to
see the Antigone before the com
pany disbands. The last presenta
tion will beat Berkeley before the
students of the University of Cali
fornia next Saturday evening.
