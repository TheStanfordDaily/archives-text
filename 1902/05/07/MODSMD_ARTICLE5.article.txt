# CALIFORNIANS AT YALE.
## U.C. Track Team Reached New Haven Yesterday and Prepares for Meet. 
### 
An Associated Press dispatch
dated at New Haven, yesterday,
says:
California's team of eleven men
arrived at New Haven today on
the 1 o'clock train from New York.
The men experienced some warm
weather through Arizona, New
Mexico, and Colorado, but their
condition was not affected by it.
To keep in condition the team
played ball and practiced starting
at stations where the train waited
long enough.
The enforced rest seemed to have
brought some of the overtrained
men back into condition, especially
Service, the half-miler, who was
slightly off color before leaving
Berkeley. Cadogan's leg seems to
be entirely well again, although it
has not been tested on the track as
yet. Immediately after their ar
rival here the men went to the New
Haven House, where they are to
stay until after the meet on Satur
day. Here they were met by a
number of Californians who are at
present doing post graduate work
at Yale.
Tomorrow evening the athletes
will be entertained at dinner by the
Pacific Coast Club at Yale, which
is composed of graduates and un
dergraduates from California, Ore
gon, and Washington. In the
afternoon the men will go out to
the Yale field to try-out on the cin
der-path. This will, in all proba
bility, be the last training that will
be done before the meet on Saturday.
The general sentiment at New
Haven is that Yale will win the
games, which makes the California
boys more anxious to meet them.
In their interclass field-day last
week the Yale men made the fol
lowing records, which jnay be used
as a basis of comparison between
the two teams:
One hundred yards, 10 1-5 sec
onds; 220 yards, 22 '2-5 seconds;
440 yards, 53 1-5 seconds; 880
yards, 2 minutes, 3 2-5 seconds;
one mile, 4 minutes, 37 seconds;
two-mile run, 9 minutes, 56 2-5
seconds; 120-yard hurdle, 16 1-5
seconds; 220-yard hurdle, 25 3-5
seconds; high jump, 5 feet, 9 inches;
broad jump, 21 feet, 6 inches; vault,
10 feet, 6 inches; hammer, 136 feet;
shot, 43 feet, 8 inches.
Spraker, Yale's best jumper, and
Boardman, their best 440-yard
man, did not compete. From these
figures the 100, 220, 880, mile, and
hurdles should be closely contested,
with the 440-yard and the two-mile
going to Yale, and the hammer and
shot-put for California.
