In providing for a smoker to
the Alumni during Commencement
week, the Senior class inaugurate
a custom which it is hoped will he
come an annual feature. It has
often heen said, and with consider
able truth, that Stanford com
mencement is lacking in features
calculated to make of it an occa
sion for any considerable number
of old students to join in the fes
tivities. Even the Alumni Reun
ion, enjoyable as it is, is meagerly
attended, depending largely on the
presence of such graduates as re
side in the immediate vicinity of
the University. Many old college
customs we have, wisely discarded,
but the Eastern idea of making
Commencement week attractive to
the alumni is too valuable a one
to be ignored. The innovation in
question is calculated to strengthen
the bond of fellowship be ween the
younger and older graduates, and
as such is heartily welcomed.
