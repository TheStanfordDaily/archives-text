# FIRST EXHIBITION.
## Foil and Mask Gave an Instructive Entertainment Last Evening. 
### 
For an informal open evening
the first exhibition of the Foil and
Mask Club last night at the gym
nasium was a success in every way.
A fairly large audience was pres
ent, in view of the fact that the en
tertainment was given on a week
day night, and all thoroughly en
joyed the short program. The in
structive bout between the Kehr
lein brothers explained by Mr. A.V.
Babine made the work of the even
ing clear. Probably the most ex
citing feature of the program was
the duel without masks, between 1).
Reynolds, '05, and A. B. Watson,
'04, with regular seconds and
referee. The broadswords bout
between 0. Du F. Kehrlein, '05, and
A. B. Swinerton, '04, was novel and
well carried out; while the three
cornered fight between E. V. Kehr
lein, '05, and C. J. Crary, '03,
against O. Du F. Kehrlein, '05, who
defended himself first with one and
then with two foils, was certainly
lively and exciting. Other bouts,
all interesting and well fought, took
place between N. Collyer, '04, and
W. R. Hogan, '05; A. J. Copp Jr.,
'02, and R. E. Renaud, '03; C. J.
Crary, '03, and D. Reynolds, '05;
and the last, which was probably
the best fencing bout, of the even
ing, was between E. V. Kehrlein,
'05, and A. V. Babine. The pro
posed fight between two Japanese
in native costume was omitted ow
ing to the inability to procure the
necessary armor.
