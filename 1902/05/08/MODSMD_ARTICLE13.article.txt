### 
A recent number of the Turf,
Field, and Farm announces that
"the faculty of Stanford University
has decided to close out the I'alo
Alto Stock Farm." Continuing,
the article says: "When in 1887,
Gov. Stanford came East and
bought at Stony Ford the then ob
scure stallion Electioneer and took
him to Palo Alto, he practically
founded the vast breeding interests
of California, which in after years
made California famous for her
trotters. Few men, indeed, have
ever seen the full fruition of all

their hopes, the realization of their
greatest ideals, —but the great sena
tor did. As the young Electioneers
grew up and were developed, they
captured in a comparatively short
space of time all the champion
ships, and when Palo Alto became
the champion stallion and Sunol
the world's champion, Palo Alto
had a roll of honor such as no
other farm ever had and which no
other farm can hope to achieve."
