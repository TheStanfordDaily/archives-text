# Subjects Not Selected.

Three more mosaics are to he
placed in the Memorial Church,
one above the entrance of the east
vestibule, one above that of the
west, and one on the coping direct
ly below the organ. The choice of
subjects for the designs has been
left to Mrs. Stanford. They will be
based on scenes in biblical history.
The church was closed last evening
after the concert by Mr. Scott
Brook and will not be reopened for
visitors until after Mrs. Stanford's
return.
