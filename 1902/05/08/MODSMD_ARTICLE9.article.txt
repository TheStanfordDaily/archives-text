# CARNIVAL NEARLY READY.
## Plans for Elizabethan Festival on Lagunita Are in Good Shape. Some Unique Features. 
### 
The plans for the Elizabethan
Carnival are progressing excel
lently, and the affair promises to
be a unique success. The rehearsals
for the different tableaux and plays
are going on well, and the girls for
the May-pole dance are practicing
in the Roble gymnasium under
charge of Miss March. Fencing
bouts between students in six
teenth century costumes have also
been arranged, while sixteenth
century refreshments will be served
in various places. The Press Club
is arranging to present a represen
tation of Ben Jonson's "Mermaid
Tavern"; Larrey Bowman, '01, has
charge of the plans for this feature.
Several water-tableaux will occur,
and the whole place will be artisti
cally decorated by means of numer
ous Japanese lanterns. The Carni
val will commence at 3 o'clock on
Tuesday afternoon of next week,
and will last until late at night.
