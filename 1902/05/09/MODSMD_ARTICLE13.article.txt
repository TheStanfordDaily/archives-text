Officers for next year will be
elected tomorrow evening at the
annual meeting of the Intersociety
Debating League, the only occasion
on which all the literary societies
are brought together. The officers
chosen serve on the Intersociety
Executive Committee, which is
made up of representatives from
the various societies, and which
controls all the arrangements for
preliminaries and finals, largely
directing the debating interests of
the student body. Although we
lost the Intercollegiate contest, and
only tied the Washington team,
we won the Carnot, and this has
been a good year for debating.
From various causes the work of
the societies has met with inter
ruption to some extent, but the
interest shown by men in prelim
inaries and finals, and by those
on the team, would be hard to excel.
Upon the other hand, support re
ceived from the student body at
large has been weak and unenthus
iastic. A well attended meeting of
the League tomorrow may serve to
revive the feeling which recognizes
the importance of debating.
