### 
The Elizabethan Carnival will
begin positively at 4:30 o'clock
on next Tuesday afternoon,and not
at any of the numerous other hours
that have been advertised. Four
thirty o'clock is announced as the
ofiic'ial time, and the performances
will begin then, according to the
program to be printed in Monday's
issue of the Daily Palo Alto. The
prices of admission have been
slightly changed since the first re
port. A fifty-cent ticket will en
title the holder to admission both
in the afternoon and in the even
ing, and will have coupons for ad
mission to three of the side-shows.
A twenty-five-cent ticket gives ad
mission once —in the afternoon or in
the evening—and one coupon.
Every one is supposed to wear the
tickets in plain view.
The cast for the play of "Pyra
mus and Thisbe" and the rehears
al in the woods, taken from
Shakspere's "Midsummer Night's
Dream," is being trained by Mr.
Bassett, and is as follows: Quince,
H. F. Henderson, '05; Pyramus,
C. D. McComish, '08; Thisbe, 1. J.
Bounds; Wall, C. L. Duncan, '04;
Moon, J. 11. Page, '03; Lion, C. L.
Firebaugh, '04; Theseus, Duke of
Athens, 11. B. Knight, '03; Hip
polyta, Miss 11. Downing, '03; De
metrius, L. 11. Roseberry, '03; Ly
sander, E. L. Ilea, '01; Philostrate,
master of the revels to Thesius, R.
V. Anderson, '04.
A game of water polo has been
arranged, to be played in the
afternoon by two picked teams of
five men each. Two regulation
halves will be played according to
intercollegiate rules, and R. R.
Long, '05, who is managing the
preparations, will be referee.
Water polo was played once before
on Lake Lagunita by Stanford
men. This was about seven years
ago, when considerable interest
prevailed in boat-racing and swim
ming on the lake. The Car
nival sports in the afternoon
will help to revive some of

the old interest and will at least
furnish amusement to the onlook
ers and all who wish to partici
pate.
A good husky shout has been se
cured for the pig chase. He will
wear the Berkeley colors and act as
goal for the swimming race. The
pig belongs to whoever catches him,
and the unlucky man is expected
to invite his friends to a barbecue
in the evening.
