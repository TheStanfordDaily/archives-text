# Third Antigone Performance.
## 
### 
• The third Antigone performance
at the University was given in
Assembly Hall last evening to a
good and appreciative audience.
The production showed the good
effect in many minor details of
the experience gained during the
Southern trip. A little slackness
marked the play last night, due to
the long rest of the cast; but this
will be remedied before the appear
ance at Berkeley tomorrow night.
A large audience is assured there,
and the performance will probably
be the best yet given.
