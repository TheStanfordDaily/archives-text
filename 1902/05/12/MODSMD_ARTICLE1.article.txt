The afternoon entertainment at
the Elizabethan Carnival tomorrow
will begin by a selection played by
the Girls' Mandolin Club on the
raft at 4 o'clock. Following that
will come the May-pole dance, se
lections by the Girls' Glee Club,
the pig race, the game of water polo,
and the tilting match, the after
noon session closing at hal-fpast
six, after the tub race. The evening
program, beginning at 7:30, is
as follows: The presentation of live
tableaux on the raft, tumbling on
the raft by the Gym Club, the play
of " Pyramus and Thisbe," seven
or eight pieces rendered by the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs, and a torch
light procession. All the other en
tertainments will continue without
interruption, both in afternoon and
evening. These include the Gypsy
camp and fortune-telling, the candy
booth, refreshments, the Punch and
Judy show, and the mysteries of
" See George."
During the intermission of one
hour between the afternoon and
evening entertainments, those with
fifty-cent tickets may leave the
grounds for dinner and will be al
lowed to return later. Twenty-five
cent tickets will give admission for
only one session. The fifty-cent tick
ets contain coupons for three fea
tures of the five which otherwise cost
ten cents ei?ch. They are the "See
George," to ride around the lake, to
take refreshments, or to have your
fortune told. Everything else will
be free, except candy, which will be
sold at the booth. One coupon is
given with a twenty-five-cent ticket.
About a dozen entries have up
to the present time been made for
the swimming race. The blue and
gold pig will be let loose from the
raft into the water, and the indi
vidual contestant may beforehand
choose any place that suits him
from which to start. The one
reaching the pig and catching it first
will win it as a prize, and will
roast it at the bonfire in the even
ing.
The refreshments are being pre
pared according to Elizabethan re
cipes, and, will be enjoyed. The
tableau, which will be given in the
evening on the lighted raft, will be
the witch scene from "Macbeth,"
Ophelia from "Hamlet," Litania
and Bolton, from"The Midsummer
Night's Dream," Prince Hal and
Hotspur from "King IV," and
Queen Elizabeth. All the char
acters will probably form into a
torchlight procession later in the
evening. The play of Py ramus
and Thisbe from"The Midsummer
Night's Dream" will be given, to
gether with the rehearsal of the
handycraftsmen at the home of
Quince, but the remarks of the mem
bers of the court of Thesus have
been cut out, so that several of
the characters mentioned in Fri
day's paper will not take part.
There will be at least three tilt
ing matches in the afternoon. The
contestants are Hummel and Doh

erty, C. W. Thomas and Ilarter
and Lyman and Wintler. 11. R
