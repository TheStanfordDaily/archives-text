At some time during the after
noon or evening tomorrow practi
cally every member of the Univer
sity will attend the Elizabethan
Carnival, and many visitors will
come from surrounding towns. If
the festival proves as successful as
the preparations indicate, and as
the promoters hope, it will proba
bly be given again next year, grow
ing into fixed annual event. Stan
ford has passed only the first dec
ade of its history, so that we are
Btill in the formative period. Every
thing done now exercises an influ
ence in the establishment of per
manent customs and traditions.
The effort to arrange a program
of aquatic sports here calls atten
tion to the possibilities which the
new gymnasium and the growth of
the University within the next few
years offer for the introduction of
rowing as one of our branches of
athletics. Although the campus is
situated at a disadvantage with
reference to any water courses for
the training of crews, the difficul
ties are not much greater than at
some other institutions where row
ing is one of the leading activities
of the student body. In some re
spects it is the most attractive col
lege sport. The new gymnasium
will doubtless be provided with
every equipment for in-door train
ing. When this is supplied it may
be comparatively easy to arrange
for work at some place on the bay.
Until Stanford is able to enter into
rowing, boat racing will not assume
much importance on the Pacific
Coast. But whenever it does the

promise of competition will give a
wonderful impetus to the associa
tions already existing at California
and at Washington.
