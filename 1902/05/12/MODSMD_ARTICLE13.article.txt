# KILLED BY HIS GUIDE.
## P.O. Simons, ex-'00, Lost His Life While Collecting in South America for British Museum. 
### 
Word has just been received here
that Perry O. Simons, ex-'OO, who
has for three years been collecting
scientific specimens for the British
Museum in South America, was
murdered some time ago by his
guide in Chili. The news was sent
from the British Consul stationed
near the place where the murder
was committed, to the British
Museum, thence to Washington,
D. C., whence it reached Simons'
brother in Kansas, who notified
friends at the University. The
murder was committed probably to
gain the few dollars in money
which the collector carried with
him, and to secure possession of
his outfit. It is probable that it
occurred when Simons lay asleep.
At different times in his letters
home he has expressed a fear of the
irresponsible natives whom he had
to help him in various ways. Twice
before attempts were made on his
life, but he was not daunted by
them. Once, at a time when his
suspicions had been aroused, he dis
covered that his meal was poisoned,
for he was made sick by eating a
little and his dog was killed by it.
At another time he was robbed of
everything he had and put in
prison by the local authorities as
as a vagabond and on general sus
picion. Fora good many weeks he
was unable to get word to anyone
until he finally notified the British
Consul, who had him released. He
was heard from here just a few
days ago, being at the time of writ
ing in the mountains of Chili.
Then he was planning to leave the
country for England, intending
finally to return to Stanford.
Perry O. Simons spent several
years at the University as a stu
dent, living in the Camp. He had
worked his own way through the
high school before coming here. It
was nearly three years ago, when
he was a senior, that he was sent
to South America by the British
Museum to collect mammals and
birds. His major was Zoology, and
he had done considerable natural
history work with University col
lectors before going. All who
worked with him on collecting ex
peditions then admired his manly
qualities of courage and endurance
and his good heart.
