# Need of College Men in Philippines
## 
### 
William H. Taft, Governor-Gen
eral of the Philippines, recently
lectured at Yale and was inter
viewed for the Daily News. Part
of the report of interview is given
below:
"Judge Taft said that there is a
pressing need for college-bred men
in the islands at present and that
when the bill relating to our insular
possessions, now pending in Con
gress, is passed this demand will be
greatly increased. These men must
be supplied by the United States to
satisfy it, and the men that are
needed to fill the important posi
tions in the military, civil and
political life, to raise the islands to
the anticipated degree, are those
who have graduated from the best
colleges of this country. The same
laws and government regulations
are now in vogue in the Philip
pines as in the United States, and
a man intending to undertake a
government position must first pass
a civil service examination satisfac
torily; or if he is to enter the army,
if he can obtain a civil appoint
ment he may receive a second lieu
tenancy. The opportunity for ad
vancement is good, but the work is
hard, in most cases, and often dis
couraging, especially as a college
man is laboring sometimes under
trying conditions, thousands of
miles from his native country. On
the other hand, a man of the right
calibre is quickly recognized and
advanced.
"Opportunities are open for every
walk in life and the demand is
great, but no one should enter upon
the profession of teacher, for which
there is special need, unless he has
a true missionary spirit."
