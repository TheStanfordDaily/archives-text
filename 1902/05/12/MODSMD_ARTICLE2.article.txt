# YALE WAS VICTORIOUS
## Defeated the California Athletes Saturday In a Good Meet. Weather Unfavorable. 
### 
The first contest of the California
track team on its Eastern trip re
sulted in a victory for Yale Satur
day at New Haven. The score was
8 5-6 to 4 1-6 First places alone
counted, each event counting for one
point. The fractions of points in
the score were caused by a tie in
the high jump between two Cali
fornians and one Yale man, and
a dead heat in the mile run. A
strong wind blowing in the faces of
the contestants accounts for the
poor records made in most of the
events.
The best account of the meet is
that of W. A. Powell, U. C. '02, in
the Chronicle, which is reproduced
in part:
"The first surprise of tho day oc
curred when Abadie crossed the
tape in the hundred-yard dash
ahead of Hargrave, winner of this
event in the international contests
last fall, and who had been looked
upon as the probable winner in the
Mott Haven championship games
this year. Abadie went off the
mark like a whirlwind, and fin
ished strong in the good time of
10 2-5 seconds. Considering the
wind against him this performance
places him well toward the front
for the intercollegiate games in New
York.
"In the mile run occurred what
seemed a bad decision in Yale's
favor. Redewell ran a beautiful
race, and led Teel half a yard to
the tape, when the latter reached
forward and broke the string with
his hand at the same time that
Redewell broke it with his breast.
Although Teel did not touch the
tape with his breast the judges de
clared the race a tie, but afterward
apparently relented by awarding
the first place medal to the Califor
nian.
"In the broad jump Hussey made
only one jump, in which he cleared
22 feet inches, and strained his
leg, which prevented any further
jumping on his part.
"The 220-yard dash looked like
Cadogan's race, but Hargrave's fin
ish was too much for the Califor
nian. In the 220-yard hurdles
Cheek and Powell led the bunch
until the eighth hurdle, when Clapp
with a wonderful burst of speed won
in the quick time of 0:25. Yale
won the 440-yard event without
any opposition."
The team starts for Princeton

today, where it will train for two
weeks for the dual meet with the
"Tigers" on May 24th. Summary:
