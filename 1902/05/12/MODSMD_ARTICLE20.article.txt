# Sermon of the Rev. Briggs.

### 
The Rev. Briggs of San Francisco
preached in the chapel yesterday,
his theme being on the necessity for
every man to enter into the best
possibilities of his nature.
" Although we know little of the
history of the period during which
Christ lived','' said Mr. Briggs, "if
one thing is better known than
another it is the story of the proph
ets. Of these, John the Baptist has
left to us the most. He was, in the
words of the Master himself, the
greatest of the long line ; greater
not in eloquence nor in sincerity,
but greater because his heart had
been touched by the spirit of Truth
to a degree more than that of any
other man. It was a wonderful
thing for the young men of the
time to rally around this untutored
teacher of the desert. The renun
ciation of all carnal delights which
his ascetism involved meant a great
deal. But this was not the highest
plane, and so it should have been
discarded.
" A prophet is not necessarily a
man of the finest caliber. Prophecy
is not a supreme work. It is only
the teaching of one who acts, almost
blindly, as the instrument of the
Supreme will. Inasmnch as a
prophet could be great, John was
the peer of all; but it was left to
Jesus of Nazareth to be and do the
greatest. John spoke of sin ; Jesus
of the pardon for all sin. John
spoke of civic right; Jesus went
beyond, and spoke of the righteous
ness in the future to grow out of
righteousness in this life."
Mr. Briggs concluded by showing
that while John was great and
strove for the good, Jesus was great
er and strove for the best. This, he
said, is the lesson every man should
take strongly to heart. When the
doors of opportunity are opened to
one and he has entered, he should
not halt within the threshold; but
just as the followers of John left
him for the higher Master, so should
a man continually progress until
he reaches the extreme limit of
which his nature is capable.
