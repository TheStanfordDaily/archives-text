# Important Geological Discovery.
## 
### 
A specimen of baculites Chicoen
eia was recently found imbedded
in sandstone in the hills near the
Page Mill road by a party of Geol
ogy students. This fossil, which
is very characteristic of the Lower
cretaceous, was hitherto unknown
in this region, and the discovery
may prove very important in de
termining the age of the beds, as
future study and excavations by
Dr. J. P.Smith will determine.
