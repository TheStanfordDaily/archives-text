# ONE MORE SUCCESS.
## Antigone Scores Another Triumph, This Time Charming Berkeley's Audience. 
### 
In the performance lust Satur
day night before the people of
Berkeley and the neighboring cities,
the Antigone company excelled
anything it had previously done.
More than 2,000 people received
the play with enthusiasm.
The Harmon Gymnasium was
gaily decorated in blue and gold
and cardinal. The supplementary
chorus and part of the orchestra
were screened in by palms and in
door plants. The altar was deco
rated with beautiful garlands of
Duchess roses made by the women
of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority.
Everything was done to make the
stage setting a beautiful one. There
was a complete transformation of
the large, bare gymnasium.
The audience began to arrive at
about seven o'clock and continued
to pour in until nine. The crush was
so great about the main entrance
that all the doors had to be thrown
open to accommodate the crowd.
A large attendance coming from
San Francisco. The perform
ance opened a little late owing to
the fact that one of the orchestra
was late, and the audience was slow
in getting seated. From the first
word spoken it was evident that
the performance was to be a com
plete success. Never before did the
chorus render the first ode so well.
It was greeted with great applause.
Every ode was vigorously ap
plauded and could have been en
cored if time had permitted. The
orchestra and supplementary chor
us did their part well. The cast,
always consistent, without an ex
ception did better than before. On
the whole the performance was one
to be proud of, one worthy to be
presented before a sister institution,
a magnificent final production.
After the performance the com
pany was treated to a lunch of
chocolate and sandwiches. Student
committees were waiting to con
duct the Stanford people to their
various lodgings. Great credit is
due Professor Richardson for his
attention and untiring efforts to
make the presentation a success.
