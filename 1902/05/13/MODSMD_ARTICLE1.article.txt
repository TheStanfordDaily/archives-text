# DESCRIPTION OF NEW GYMNASIUM.
## Architect Hodges is Designing a Building to Accommodate 2,000 Students.â€” Training Quarters, Plunge Bath, Drill Hall, Ball Room, and a Complete Equipment. 
### 
Few students and members of the
faculty realize the extent of the new
gymnasium, which is being planned
by Architect Hodges for Stanford.
Those interested in the gymnasium
are receiving many letters from
friends in the East and in Europe
commenting on the reputation the
proposed building has already
gained for architectural beauty and
perfection of equipment. Although
the plans are not fully completed,
it is possible to get an idea of the
general outline of the gymnasium.
The structure will consist of a
three-story stone building 312 by
150 feet, after the plan of the Mu
seum. It will be of stone finish
and of pleasing and majestic appear
ance, by far the handsomest build
ing that has yet been erected on
the campus, with the exception of
the Memorial Church. In the rear
of the main building will be a
frame structure 100 by 200, con
taining an eight- or ten-lap track
with provision for track and field
sports.
On the first floor to the left as
one enters will be bicycle stands for
use in wet weather. Just behind
are lockers for the accommodation
of 2000 students. The lockers will
be constructed with facilities for
drying clothes and proper ventila
tion. Directly connected with the
locker-rooms will be ample bath-'
ing facilities, consisting of shower
baths, needle baths, steam baths,
tub baths, and a plunge of 30 by
72 feet. If the proportion of stu
dents taking gymnasium work in
creases as it has during the last few
years, there is a probability in the
near future of the number reaching
1,000. A plunge the size of the
one proposed would not accommo- !
date an attendance of that size, j
but the water supply of the Uni
versity would not permit of a
larger plunge. In connection with
the bathing-rooms will be drying
rooms and a recovery-room. In
this part of the building there will I
also be facilities for drying football
clothing. The training quarters,
with the rubbing-rooms and the
office of the student body treas
urer, will be near, with bath and
locker-rooms.
On the other side of the main
entrance, on the first floor, will be;
a handball court of regulation size,
with a gallery for the accommoda
tion of spectators. There will also
be at least four other smaller courts
for general use. With such an
equipment intercollegiate handball
011 a Varsity basis will not be a
possibility but a probability. On
the first floor there will be four
bowling alleys.
On the second floor above the
locker- and bath-rooms will be loca
ted the drill hall, 100 feet by 100
feet, giving 10,000 square feet in
the clear for drill work. Conveni
ently located with reference to the
drill hall will be the offices of the
director and assistants. Twenty feet 1

above the drill hall will be a gal
lery, three sides of which will be
twenty feet wide, thus giving 6,000
square feet. It may be of interest
j to note by way of comparison that
; there are only 5,400 square feet in
the entire hall of the present gym
nasium. The management has sig
nified its intention of putting all
fixed apparatus, such as spring
board, vaulting-bar, chest-weights,
and wall machines in the gallery,
thus leaving the main hall free for
drill work. To the rear of the
gallery will be rooms for boxing,
fencing, and wrestling, and a large
hall for the accommodation of those
students doing corrective gymna
sium work. As this is a special
feature, such ample accommoda
tions will greatly facilitate the
work. Here storeroom for gymna
sium apparatus and a laboratory
for special investigation in connec
tion with gymnasium work will be
located. Such laboratories have
become a feature of the larger mod
ern gymnasiums, and afford an op
portunity for gaining scientific
knowledge concerning the physi
ology of exercise.
On the second floor will be ac
commodations for anthropometric
work, photometric work, and offices
for the University consulting phy
sician. There will also be a library
containing standard literature on
gymnastic and athletic work. On
this floor a committee room will be
provided for the Board of Trustees
of the University, to be used by
them until their permanent quart
ers are ready in the new Library.
The third floor will contain a
ball-room, 100 by 100 feet. To the
rear of this hall will be a banquet
room, 50 feet by 70 feet, together
with a butler's pantry. These ac
commodations, besides the offices,
toilet-rooms, carpenter shop, boil
er-room, etc., will constitute the
main building. The frame building
in the rear will be connected with
the main gymnasium by a passage
way. It will provide for an eight
or ten-lap track, with accommoda
tions for pole-vault, high jump,
broad jump, and shot-put. What
ever space is left vacant will be
utilized for signal practice in foot
ball, battery practice for baseball,
and such other games as basket
ball or indoor baseball. Near the
gymnasium will probably be located
athletic fields, with grandstands
and dressing-room accommodations
for competing teams. The gym
nasium management expects to
have accommodations for basket
ball, association football, baseball,
handball, and tennis, and also
hopes to provide a play-ground,
such as is popular in New York
and Boston.
Exercises may then include swim
ming, boxing, wrestling, fencing,
starting 011 the track, sprinting,
distance running, hurdling, pole
vault, high and broad jump, and
shot-put, for general development.

feet, giving 10,000 square feet in
the clear for drill work. Conveni
ently located with reference to the
drill hall will be the offices of the
director and assistants. Twenty feet 1

above the drill hall will be a gal
lery, three sides of which will be
twenty feet wide, thus giving 6,000
square feet. It may be of interest
j to note by way of comparison that
; there are only 5,400 square feet in
the entire hall of the present gym
nasium. The management has sig
nified its intention of putting all
fixed apparatus, such as spring
board, vaulting-bar, chest-weights,
and wall machines in the gallery,
thus leaving the main hall free for
drill work. To the rear of the
gallery will be rooms for boxing,
fencing, and wrestling, and a large
hall for the accommodation of those
students doing corrective gymna
sium work. As this is a special
feature, such ample accommoda
tions will greatly facilitate the
work. Here storeroom for gymna
sium apparatus and a laboratory
for special investigation in connec
tion with gymnasium work will be
located. Such laboratories have
become a feature of the larger mod
ern gymnasiums, and afford an op
portunity for gaining scientific
knowledge concerning the physi
ology of exercise.
On the second floor will be ac
commodations for anthropometric
work, photometric work, and offices
for the University consulting phy
sician. There will also be a library
containing standard literature on
gymnastic and athletic work. On
this floor a committee room will be
provided for the Board of Trustees
of the University, to be used by
them until their permanent quart
ers are ready in the new Library.
The third floor will contain a
ball-room, 100 by 100 feet. To the
rear of this hall will be a banquet
room, 50 feet by 70 feet, together
with a butler's pantry. These ac
commodations, besides the offices,
toilet-rooms, carpenter shop, boil
er-room, etc., will constitute the
main building. The frame building
in the rear will be connected with
the main gymnasium by a passage
way. It will provide for an eight
or ten-lap track, with accommoda
tions for pole-vault, high jump,
broad jump, and shot-put. What
ever space is left vacant will be
utilized for signal practice in foot
ball, battery practice for baseball,
and such other games as basket
ball or indoor baseball. Near the
gymnasium will probably be located
athletic fields, with grandstands
and dressing-room accommodations
for competing teams. The gym
nasium management expects to
have accommodations for basket
ball, association football, baseball,
handball, and tennis, and also
hopes to provide a play-ground,
such as is popular in New York
and Boston.
Exercises may then include swim
ming, boxing, wrestling, fencing,
starting 011 the track, sprinting,
distance running, hurdling, pole
vault, high and broad jump, and
shot-put, for general development.
Few students and members of the
faculty realize the extent of the new
gymnasium, which is being planned
by Architect Hodges for Stanford.
Those interested in the gymnasium
are receiving many letters from
friends in the East and in Europe
commenting on the reputation the
proposed building has already
gained for architectural beauty and
perfection of equipment. Although
the plans are not fully completed,
it is possible to get an idea of the
general outline of the gymnasium.
The structure will consist of a
three-story stone building 312 by
150 feet, after the plan of the Mu
seum. It will be of stone finish
and of pleasing and majestic appear
ance, by far the handsomest build
ing that has yet been erected on
the campus, with the exception of
the Memorial Church. In the rear
of the main building will be a
frame structure 100 by 200, con
taining an eight- or ten-lap track
with provision for track and field
sports.
On the first floor to the left as
one enters will be bicycle stands for
use in wet weather. Just behind
are lockers for the accommodation
of 2000 students. The lockers will
be constructed with facilities for
drying clothes and proper ventila
tion. Directly connected with the
locker-rooms will be ample bath-'
ing facilities, consisting of shower
baths, needle baths, steam baths,
tub baths, and a plunge of 30 by
72 feet. If the proportion of stu
dents taking gymnasium work in
creases as it has during the last few
years, there is a probability in the
near future of the number reaching
1,000. A plunge the size of the
one proposed would not accommo- !
date an attendance of that size, j
but the water supply of the Uni
versity would not permit of a
larger plunge. In connection with
the bathing-rooms will be drying
rooms and a recovery-room. In
this part of the building there will I
also be facilities for drying football
clothing. The training quarters,
with the rubbing-rooms and the
office of the student body treas
urer, will be near, with bath and
locker-rooms.
On the other side of the main
entrance, on the first floor, will be;
a handball court of regulation size,
with a gallery for the accommoda
tion of spectators. There will also
be at least four other smaller courts
for general use. With such an
equipment intercollegiate handball
011 a Varsity basis will not be a
possibility but a probability. On
the first floor there will be four
bowling alleys.
On the second floor above the
locker- and bath-rooms will be loca
ted the drill hall, 100 feet by 100
feet, giving 10,000 square feet in
the clear for drill work. Conveni
ently located with reference to the
drill hall will be the offices of the
director and assistants. Twenty feet 1

above the drill hall will be a gal
lery, three sides of which will be
twenty feet wide, thus giving 6,000
