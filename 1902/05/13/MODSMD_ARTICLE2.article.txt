# STUDENTS MAY HELP.
## Plans of Mr. Peterson for Stock Farm and University Collections in the Museum. 
### 
For over a year Harry C. Peter
son, the curator of the Museum, lias
been planning the selection and
equipment of a University and a
Stock Farm room. His object in
doing that is to make a Stanford
collection entirely distinct from the
memoirs and purely personal be
longings of the members of the
Stanford family, and to have a
place where those things dealing
especially with University life and
student body affairs may be kept.
The wisdom of an immediate step
in this direction was made appar
ent by a realization that the arti
cles which should be kept together
were becoming scattered, and,especi
ally some of those pertaining to the
pioneer days, were growing exceed
ingly scarce.
Mr. Peterson has selected the
upper floor of the north annex for
the collection, and has already a
grasp upon everything that is ob
tainable in the way of relics of the
Stock Farm and the early interests
of the Senator. Frank Covey, fore
man of the farm, has helped in
gathering together a large number
of pictures of the famous horses, of
prize awards, and such exhibits.
The four-wheel skeleton wagon,
weighing sixty-four pounds, in
which Senator Stanford drove Oc
cident; a ball-bearing sulky, the
first of its kind ever made; Leland
Stanford Junior's rig with yellow
running gear, in which he generally
drove about; a Rumsey fire engine
and hose, bought by Leland for
use at the residence; and the White
hall boat, which Leland used on
Lagunita, have been placed in the
room along with the skeletons of
Occident, Palo Alto, and Elec
tioneer. For comparison the bones
of a working horse will be mounted
and put alongside the skeletons of
the thoroughbreds.
A number of old prints and
original plans have been secured
and framed. The original plot of
the Arizona gardens by R. Ulrich,
a photograph of the gates taken by
Thors directly after their construc
tion, a conception of the Univer
sity from the Pacific Advertiser of
1891, and a plan of the central
premises made in 1888, have within
the last few days been left at the
Museum.
To this room will be added ex
hibits dealing primarily with the
processes of building. Chisels, mal
lets, and the tools used in stone
carving, draughting, etc., an illus
trated process showing the mosaic
construction, and similar exhibits
will be made. The old engine, No.
1, now in a shed back of Roble, will
in time be put along with the other
relics. The articles now on exhibi
tion in the Stanford room, includ
ing cups, the ears of Palo Alto,
trowels, and awards, pertaining di
rectly to the Stock Farm and simi
lar interests, will be changed to the
new quarters.
The plans for the development of
a University collection are also well
along. Mr. Dodge of the Library
will assist, as he is working up a
collection of University publica

j tions for the Library. Members of
j the faculty and alumni have been
asked to contribute and are giving
| their earnest cooperation in the
work. The aim of the Museum
will be to gain a complete file of all
University publications, including
Quads, Sequoias, etc., to get to
gether all posters, programs, bogies,
and in fact anything and every
thing that has to do with student
body or University activities. Most
important of these at present will
be the large posters, many of which,
such as the "bloomer" poster of
1900, have been of note in Univer
sity history. Mr. Peterson wants
every poster from the beginning to
the present time; large, small, ar
tistic or josh, all are expected to be
in at once, as arrangements for
framing them will commence short
ly. These large posters will be put
into a revolving frame like the one
now in the Museum containing
Egyptian cloth. This, which neces
sitates the expenditure of some ten
or twelve dollars to the poster,
marks the earnestness with which
the promoters have entered into
their scheme. In every case full
credit will be given on the labels
to the donors. Programs of inter
collegiate events, of class dances,
and especially senior week pro
grams are desired for exhibition.
Many articles have already been
promised. The members of the
alumni when approached have in
variably expressed the greatest in
terest in the plan, and have turned
over their own personal belongings.
Mr. Peterson will shortly make
direct appeal to each member of
the alumni within his reach. He
has made the following statement
in regard to the work:
"Though we are well along in
our plans, comparatively few things
have been presented. Undergrad
uates may assist me in many ways
although they may have but little
themselves. The program and
poster line for the last four years is
scarcely begun. Aside from per
sonal donations, I should desire co
operation from the students. When
they know where something is I
should like for them to let me
know. Old lithographs and prints
are very valuable. I found one in
a back-yard scrap-barrel which ten
years from now probably could not
be reproduced. If any one has
photographs which they will give
to the collection, or if they will
lend me the negatives to get prints
from, I shall be greatly obliged.
Each committee as it issues a pro
gram or poster should send at least
two copies either to Mr. Dodge or
myself. For everything that comes
in, credit will be given on the la
bels."
