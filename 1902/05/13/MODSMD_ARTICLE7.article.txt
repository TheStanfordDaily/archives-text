When the new gymnasium be
comes a reality, with its big drill
hall, its baths and plunge, its
covered track and handball courts,
and its equipment perfect in every
detail, the students who enjoy the
privileges will never appreciate the
disadvantages that have been met
in Encina gymnasium for several
years. Cramped for room and ap
paratus, with no bath but a cold
shower, and with imperfect facili
ties, the interest shown in gymnas
tics by the men is a tribute to their
own activity, while the results ac
complished by Instructor Storey
under the circumstances are won
derful. Although physical train
ing is not required, the percentage
registered for the work is unusually
large. No other announcement
made has met such direct and en
thusiastic approval from students
as the one that the new gymnasium
would be built. Mr. Hodges' plans
are even more extensive and per
fect than had been supposed, and

Mrs. Stanford's beneficence in
wishing to provide the best gym
nasium facilities possible meets the
interests of more students than any
thing else that may be done.
