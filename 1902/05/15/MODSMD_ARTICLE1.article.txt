# THE 						COLLEGE JOURNALS.
## John P. Young, Managing Editor of the San Francisco "Chronicle," Discusses the Dailies. 
### 
Five copies of each of the college
dailies published in America were
recently sent by the college ex
change editor of the Daily Palo
Alto to Mr. John P. Young, man
aging editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle, andoneof the prominent
newspaper men of America. The
numbers of each paper submitted
were consecutive, and were of the
same dates as the others. In re
sponse to the request fora criticism
of these papers, Mr. Young wrote:
"When I promised to comply with
your invitation to discuss 'the
comparative merits of the fourteen
college daily newspapers in this
country' I had but a moderate
familiarity with that class of journ
als. Since examining the files of
the thirteen college daily publica
tions which you have submitted for
inspection I have found the task a
more difficult one than I antici
pated, for the reason that their
points of resemblance are much
more obvious than their differences.
They all appear to be formed on a
common model —that of the Har
vard Crimson. With a single ex
ception they are all of four pages
of four columns each. They nearly
all wisely confine themselves in pre
senting news to what must be most
interesting to those who patronize
them, namely the affairs of the
university within whose walls they
are published, and their view rarely
extends beyond the campus. They
all have one striking defect, that of
according disproportionate space to
advertising. In a journal of six
teen columns it is hardly fair tot he
reader to devote more than half the
space to displayed advertisements
and reading notices. It is not only
unfair, but it is unnecessary, for
advertisers would cheerfully pay
more for less space in journals con
taining a greater quantity of read
ing matter. The oldest of the col
lege journals appear to be the worst
offenders in this regard. Harvard
Crimson devotes nine of its sixteen
columns to ads, and the Daily
Princetonian has only five columns
of room to spare for reading matter.
The Daily Palo Alto treats its
subscribers more liberally than
most of its contemporaries, giving
about ten columns of reading mat
ter daily, and the Daily Calif or nian
divides its space about equally be
tween ads and reading matter.
"There may be some excuse for
dealing liberally with the adver
tiser in the matter of space, but
none can be urged in defense of the
practice of the Daily Student of
using slugs instead of leads, a de
vice by which its scant reading
space is filled with an average of
about 135 words of reading matter
to the column. The result is a pa
per which shows little advance on
the Acta Diurna of the days of
Julius Caesar. Considering the
fact that most college journals have
adequate staffs —I note the Daily
Californian has forty editors, asso
ciate editors and reporters —such
excessive brevity is hardly pardon
able.
"It may fairly be said of the col

lection of college journals under re
view that they are singularly free
from stiltedness. The news printed
in them is, as a rule, presented
plainly and directly, and the edi
torial comment and criticism is of
the matter-of-fact order. In one
publication only did 1 notice any
"fine writing." The Michigan Daily
News appears to indulge in the use
of such overworked words as
"enormous," "strenuous," "high
noon," etc. The Daily lowan's ed
itorials are the most thoughtful in
the papers under notice, and the
topics chosen are of a higher order
than those selected by rival col
lege editors. Perhaps the aim of
the college journalist is to be pre
cise and concise; if so, he generally
hits the bull's-eye, but in doing so
he sacrifices literary form, which
may be achieved even when space
is limited, and without incurring
the risk of perpetrating " fine
writing."
"And this reminds me to add that
in the sixty-five numbers of the

thirteen different journals sub
mitted by you for inspection, there
is an utter avoidance of slang; even
the sporting news being treated in
a fashion which would permit an
outsider of average intelligence to
grasp its meaning. On the whole,
considering the limitations, I should
say that the performances of col
lege journalists are highly credita
ble, and that they understand the
wants of their patrons more thor
ougly, and know as well how to
meet them as any other class of
newspaper men."
