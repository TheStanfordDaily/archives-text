Mr. John P. Young's criticism of
the college daily, which he has
kindly prepared at the request of a
member of the Daily I'alo Alto
staff, will be read with unusual
interest, for it comes from a man of
long newspaper experience who was
not previously familiar with the
student news publications. The
primary purpose of these papers is
to serve as daily bulletins of events
in the college communities. The
news field is confined so closely to
affairs within the student body that
the range of interest is not great,
being devoted almost entirely to
athletics, lectures, debating, and
the work of clubs and other organi
zations. At an institution the size
of Stanford these topics are already
expanded as fully as the public
cares to read about them, so that
there would be nothing gained by
increasing the amount of reading
matter without at the same time
branching into the field of general
newspapers.
The college daily occupies a
peculiar position in this re
spect, giving itseif strictly to an
nouncements and news —that which
seems to be news within the com
munity — and refusing both to
trespass on the province of the out
side newspaper, and at the same
time to usurp any of the functions
of the student literary publications.
This policy is followed to some ex

tent, perhaps, because the older
papers are taken as patterns, but
mainly because the experience and
the logic of the situation from the
inside seem to pronounce it the
wisest.
However, Mr. Young's criti
cism as to the amount of read-;
ing matter presented is directed not
so much against the brevity of what
the journals publish, as against the
disproportionate space given to ad
vertising. Here, again, the peculiar
situation is made evident. For the
sake of convenience a paper of four
pages of four columns is about as
small as should he issued. Never
theless, for the reasons already out
lined, little more than eight or ten
columns of the space can he til led
conveniently every day. Therefore,
the remainder must be crowded
with advertising. If the papers
were to come out only twice or three
times a week the reading matter of
each issue could he largely in
creased, hut this would destroy their
value as bulletins.
Mr. Young's criticisms are, no
doubt, thoge which present theni-
Helves most readily to an outsider.
Some do not have an equal force
from the interior point of view.
Although the number of persons on
the staff is unusually large, the
work on the paper is done by stu
dents in addition to their regular
studies, which are supposed to re
quire most of their time. In many
ways these men gain a valuable
training. The observation of Mr.
Young which will be most readily
approved by every one is that with
regard to the editorials. Often
written to fill simply a small space,
dealing with a narrow range of sub
jects that have been discussed and
rehashed until every phase of them
has become hackneyed—the pen
ally of trying not to reach beyond
the orthodox field—the editorial is
a laborious creation.
Innovations and improvements
will be made in college jour
nalism in the future, but, as
Mr. Young says, the student
dailies probably meet the wants of
their patrons as well as any other
class of newspapers.
