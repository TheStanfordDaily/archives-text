oblong table was a wreath of niaile,
hiding the wires which, in front of I
each plate, were tapped for tiie pur

end were clumps of red carnations,
surrounded by a mass of red tara
tan dotted with maiden hair ferns.
Mrs. Stanford was placed in the
center on the Waikiki side of the
board, and in front of her was a
mammoth "S" made in red carna
tions.
Before the dinner was announced
Mrs. Stanford held a reception in
the small writing-room off the main
corridor, and the young people
who had known her upon the
campus of the University and
in its balls clasped her hands and
talked with iter of the days when
the University was young. When
they took their seats to the strains
of a march by the Quintet Club,
they found cardinal leis and a
menu card upon red satin ribbon.
One of the features of the evening
was the presentation to Mrs. Stan
ford of a calabash of Koa, on one
side being the enameled arms of
the country,and beneath it a silver
plate with the inscription: "Pre
sented to Mrs. Leland Stanford,
with the Aloha of the Stanford men
and women of 11 a waii."'
When the interchanges of greet

board, Toast master J. Tarn Mc-
Gtew, who sat at the right of the
hostess, ca 1 led upon A. Lewis, Jr.,
to respond to the toast "Stanford."
Mr. Lewis said that as a representa

class of the University, be extended
greetings to Mrs. Stanford for the
men and women of the University
here.
Mrs. Stanford's Speech.
Mrs. Stanford rose at the conclu
sion of Mr. Lewis's remarks, and
said, in brief: "I come to you with
a heart full of love and tenderness
for all- those who have been helped
by their work and study at Stan
ford. It is with joy that I now
realize that God has spared me to

see the realization of our hopes.
The days which have passed have
been full of heartaches and suffer
ing, and 1 have .felt the responsi
bility for the work which was in
augurated by my dear husband
and myself, and I often feel that 1 j
am not alone, but that he must be j
near me and helping me.
"We have now come to a point
where the work of the University
will go forward along lines which I j
have long cherished, and which will
lead to a higher and better life. My
heart has been gladdened since my
arrival here by the news that the
Itev. lleber Newton has accepted
the charge of the University Me
morial Church. 1 feel that God
has been good in letting me live to
see this day, this fruition of hopes
that have been close to my heart,
and which 1 believe will be of great
good to the University.
"1 am glad to realize that you all
have been fitted for thp struggles of
life and to meet its duties, and I
hope that you will feel that above
all must come soul development.
I wish you all to lie successful."
Mrs. Stanford's remarks were
cheered by the guests as she closed
with a catch in her voice, which
showed the feeling which moved
her.
The singing of a number of new
songs was a feature, some of them
being written to fit the music of
the Quintet Club's Hawaiian selec
tions. The dinner was a most ex
cellent repast, there being such
things as Vina punch, of claret, as
I everything had to be red, a Palo
i Alto salad, a consomme a la Encina
Hall, and other things California!).
The hit of the evening was of serv
ing of grape fruit, cut in halt and
garnished, from the top of each
half-sphere flying a cardinal flag
with the word "Stanford."

and alumni of any school. The oc
casion was the dinner given by Mrs.
Stanford to the Stanford folk of
Honolulu last evening, in lieu of
the reception which ihey had pro
posed in commemoration of her
visit to the city.
The east parlor of the Moana
Hotel, which bits been Mrs. Stan
ford's home during her visit, was
transformed intoa banqueting-room
by Manager Allen, and there the
dinner was served. In the center
of the room were set the tallies with
plates for twenty-eight guests. the
garniture of the hoard whs in the
color of the University. About the
oblong table was a wreath of niaile,
hiding the wires which, in front of I
each plate, were tapped for tiie pur
pose of a cardinal light. At either
end were clumps of red carnations,
surrounded by a mass of red tara
tan dotted with maiden hair ferns.
Mrs. Stanford was placed in the
center on the Waikiki side of the
board, and in front of her was a
mammoth "S" made in red carna
tions.
Before the dinner was announced
Mrs. Stanford held a reception in
the small writing-room off the main
corridor, and the young people
who had known her upon the
campus of the University and
in its balls clasped her hands and
talked with iter of the days when
the University was young. When
they took their seats to the strains
of a march by the Quintet Club,
they found cardinal leis and a
menu card upon red satin ribbon.
One of the features of the evening
was the presentation to Mrs. Stan
ford of a calabash of Koa, on one
side being the enameled arms of
the country,and beneath it a silver
plate with the inscription: "Pre
sented to Mrs. Leland Stanford,
with the Aloha of the Stanford men
and women of 11 a waii."'
When the interchanges of greet
ings had been made about the
board, Toast master J. Tarn Mc-
Gtew, who sat at the right of the
hostess, ca 1 led upon A. Lewis, Jr.,
to respond to the toast "Stanford."
Mr. Lewis said that as a representa
tive of the class of '95, the pioneer
class of the University, be extended
greetings to Mrs. Stanford for the
men and women of the University
here.
Mrs. Stanford's Speech.
Mrs. Stanford rose at the conclu
sion of Mr. Lewis's remarks, and
said, in brief: "I come to you with
a heart full of love and tenderness
for all- those who have been helped
by their work and study at Stan
ford. It is with joy that I now
realize that God has spared me to

see the realization of our hopes.
The days which have passed have
been full of heartaches and suffer
ing, and 1 have .felt the responsi
bility for the work which was in
augurated by my dear husband
and myself, and I often feel that 1 j
am not alone, but that he must be j
near me and helping me.
"We have now come to a point
where the work of the University
will go forward along lines which I j
have long cherished, and which will
lead to a higher and better life. My
heart has been gladdened since my
arrival here by the news that the
Itev. lleber Newton has accepted
the charge of the University Me
morial Church. 1 feel that God
has been good in letting me live to
see this day, this fruition of hopes
that have been close to my heart,
and which 1 believe will be of great
good to the University.
"1 am glad to realize that you all
have been fitted for thp struggles of
life and to meet its duties, and I
hope that you will feel that above
all must come soul development.
I wish you all to lie successful."
Mrs. Stanford's remarks were
cheered by the guests as she closed
with a catch in her voice, which
showed the feeling which moved
her.
The singing of a number of new
songs was a feature, some of them
being written to fit the music of
the Quintet Club's Hawaiian selec
tions. The dinner was a most ex
cellent repast, there being such
things as Vina punch, of claret, as
I everything had to be red, a Palo
i Alto salad, a consomme a la Encina
Hall, and other things California!).
The hit of the evening was of serv
ing of grape fruit, cut in halt and
garnished, from the top of each
half-sphere flying a cardinal flag
with the word "Stanford."

Stanford, Mr. Frank Andrade, Miss
C. G. Barnhisel, Miss M. Barnard,

tiaer of April 29th gives an elubor- i
ate description of the Stanford ban
quet there last month. The article
says, in part:
Cardinal shone from hoard and
decoration upon the faces of Mrs.
Leland Stanford and her guests,
more than a score of the young
men and women who had grad
uated from the university which
bears the name of her son; songs
and yells, such as resounded upon
the campus of the young univer
sity, rang through the corridors,
and finally, to the strains of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," there was con
cluded one of the most pleasant re
unions ever held by the founder
and alumni of any school. The oc
casion was the dinner given by Mrs.
Stanford to the Stanford folk of
