# GIFT TO MOULTON.
## Track Men This Morning Presented Their Trainer With a Handsome Locket. 
### 
This morning the members of the
year's track team presented their
trainer, E. W. Moulton, with a
beautiful gold locket on one side of
which were engraved his initials,
E. W. M., and on the other an ar
tistic block "S." Every man who
has been out under "Dad" joined
in wishing the fatherly old trainer
the greatest success in the world.
He has completely won the hearts
of his men. The locket was given
as a small token of the esteem and
appreciation with which they re
gard him. They feel that nothing
but good will, earnestness of pur
pose, self-sacrifice, and whole-souled
interest in the team has character
ized Moulton's work this season.
On receiving the gift "Dad" ex
pressed himself as follows: "Boys,
I'm not much of a talker, but 1
want to thank you for this remem-

brance. When the year began I
had faith in you, and I think that
my year with you has proven that
I was not mistaken. 1 have faith
enough in you to know that every
man of you will try to be a first
place man next year, and that is
all I want. I have done my best
with you this year; I'll do my best
next year. We'll put our shoulders
to the wheel and shove it through
for all there is in it. I appreciate
this sign of good feeling and faith
more than I can say. I think it
points to good results in the future."
