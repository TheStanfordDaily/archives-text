School of Philosophy, Green Acre,
Me., spoke in the chapel this after
noon on the different phases of the

and prospects fora great future.
But all these are accompanied by
great responsibility on our part.

in the active life of the world. Every
one should work for the good, not
against it. She closed by speaking
of duty to others, the obligations
under which each one rests to work
shoulder to shoulder with his fel

ing pauses in his own work, to

strugglers around him.
