# â€œTHE RANK OUTSIDER."
## Large Chorus and Expensive Scenery for the Senior Farce. Cast of Characters. 
### 
"The Rank Outsider" will be put
on in Assembly Hall as the Senior
Farce of the Class of '02, on next
Thursday evening. It is impos
sible to compare the production to
the successful musical extrava
ganza put on last Commencement
because the present show is of an
entirely different style of farce,
more nearly resembling, in situa
tions, characters, and rapidity of
action, the legitimate farce-comedy,
"James NVobberts, Freshman."
During the past few years the plays
presented at Stanford have been
noted for imaginative and fanciful
plots of the romantic and bewilder
ing order; and in abrupt con
rast, "The Rank Outsider" deals
with real college scenes and the
sort of fellows you meet every hour
between classes.
The second act, with a chorus of
forty-nine voices on the stage, and
orchestral accompaniment to the
action, is arranged with special
scenery to present a garden fete on
the wooded shores of Lagunita. Jap
anese lanterns will be strung
through the foliage, rustic seats
and potted plants will adorn the
stage, and at the finals, unique
electrical effects will be turned
upon the scene.
The cast of actors has been se
lected from the best talent of the
University, and is as follows:
Colonel Gibbs, the Rank Out
sider, uncle of Pickerly

The chorus of carefully pitched
voices is being trained by Miss
May Hurlburt, as musical director,
to whose taste is due the selection
of bright, catchy music from the
latest New York operas never yet
sung on the Coast. A costumed
chorus of six knockers will add to
the spectacular effects of the show
by grotesque inarches, songs, and
ax drills. The cast is being trained
by Mrs. Will Irwin, well known to
many of the older students as Har
riet Hyde of the class of '98.
Among musical features are songs
written by Larrey Bowman, Miss
Hurlburt, R. J. Sterrett, and
Fletcher Wagner.
