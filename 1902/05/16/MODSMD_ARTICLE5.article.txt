# THE 						"QUAD" FOR NEXT YEAR
## Board of Editors Partially Selected. Book Will Continue Story of the University. 
### 
Work has already begun on the
Quad for next year. Appointments
to the staff are not complete, as
yet, but the following selections
have been made by the editor,
Isaac Russell: Miss Alice Kimball,
Miss Ethel Traphagen, R. V. Ander
son, B. C. Bubb, H. C. Brown, Nor
man Collyer, B. R. Cocks, F. A.
Ford, Fred. C. Fowler, O. A. Wil
son, W. Young.
It is the purpose of the editors to
get the book planned, and, as far
as possible, have the more general
drawing done during the summer,
thus leaving the last months for
current happenings. A list of de
sired drawings has been prepared,
and assignments are being made
among the artists.
It is the purpose of the board to
have the book center upon the new
growth of the University, now grow
ing on to the old, just as this year's
book centered upon the completion
of the inner quadrangle. While the
prizes for a story and a poem will
not be officially announced until
next semester, it is hoped that the
writers who intend to work during
the summer will keep their stories
in tone with the central idea of the
book.
Photographs of the new buildings
are now being taken in order to
keep a complete record of their
growth. It is the purpose of next
year's editors to take up the story
of the University where the 1903
Quad leaves it with the completion
of the inner quadrangle and the
Church, "where the new joins on to
the old."
It is hoped by the board that the
writers competing for the story
and poem will draw their inspira
tion and local color from the new
university now growing up, and not
from the old quad. The desire is
to catch the change in the spirit of
Stanford, resulting with the changes
in her facilities, and to put it all
down in black and white.
