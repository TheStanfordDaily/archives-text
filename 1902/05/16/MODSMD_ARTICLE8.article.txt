### 
"True Tales of Birds and Beasts"
is the title of a new animal hook
for children, edited by President
David Starr Jordan. The book is
very neatly put together and pub
lished by D. C. Heath & Co., Bos
ton. There are sixty-one illustra
tions by Miss Mary H. Wellman,
associate artist of the Hopkins
Laboratory, made under the per
sonal supervision of Dr. Jordan.
There are eleven stories, varied in
character, which touch on the fea
tures of animal life interesting to
children. Dr. Jordan has two chap
ters, "The Story of a Salmon" and
"The Little Blue Fox," and Dane
Coolidge, '98, contributes two ar
ticles, "The Quail of Gavilan" and
"Pico Coyote and Swivel-ears."
"Brute Neighbors," by Henry
David Thoreau, and"The Bobo
link," by Washingron Irving, are
also published. "The Story of
Kutha," by George Archibald
Clark, secretary to the President,
gives the story of the life of a fur
seal on St. Paul's island, Alaska.
Four other chapters are "Twin
Babies," by Joaquin Miller; "The
Battle of Ants," by Bailey Willard;
"A Family of Murres," by Charles
Keeler, and"The Dog that Lied,"
by Jean Aicard. On the whole the
book is extremely interesting.
