THE ATCHISON, TOPEKA AND SANTA FE RAILWAY SYSTEM
is the only one with its own rails
San Francisco to Chicago
There are combinations of railways which join each other in forming through lines between these cities, but the
SANTA FE
is the only one under the same management, and therefore the only one with uniformity of service and undivided respon
sibility. When you start on the Santa Fe you are sure to go through. You will never miss connections, because
THERE ARE NO CONNECTIONS TO MAKE
from San Francisco to Chicago. You always go through, so bear this in mind, because it is an important considera
tion. In addition to being the only through line, the Santa Fe is the only railway reaching the most stupendous
scenic wonder of the world —the GRAND CANYON OF ARIZONA.
The CALIFORNIA LIMITED leaves San Francisco daily at p a.m.,
the OVERLAND EXPRESS leaves San Francisco daily at 8 p.m.,
both running to Chicago without change. #£* ££
