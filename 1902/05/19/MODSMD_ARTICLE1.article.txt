# ON SALE AT 9 O'CLOCK
## The 						1903 "Quad" Will Be Out Tomorrow.â€”An Elaborate Edition. 
### 
The 1903 Quad will be put on
sale tomorrow morning at nine
o'clock on the quad, near the regis
trar's oflice. The books will be
sold at two places, one for the gen
eral public where the price will be
$2, and one for the Juniors who
have paid their assessments,to whom
the price will be $1.50. Quads for
juniors, who have paid their as
sessments, will be reserved until
noon and no longer, as all the busi
ness must be finished tomorrow.The
edition will number 600 and will
doubtless be sold in a very short
time.
In general this ninth annual
Quad is intended as a memorial of
the ten years' growth of Stanford.
The art work will be a special
feature of this edition, since it will
include contributions by every
Stanford artist of any importance
from Merle Johnson, '97, who had
work on the '95 annual, down
to the present undergraduates.
Among those in the University
who have contributed drawing are
J. K. Bonnell, '03, R. J. Sterrett,
'02, A. R. Johnson,'o3, R. E. Re
naud, '03, and among the new
artists, Miss Traphagen, '04, and
Miss McLauthlin, '03.
The Quad will also embody the
spirit of,.this year which has been
particularly active, not only ma-,
terially in the growth of buildings,
the completion of the church, and
in the deed of grant, but also in
student activities and in the culture
of the West as typified in the pro
duction of the Antigone.
The literary work will be of the
best. There will be articles by Pres
ident Jordan and Dr. Elliott, and a
remarkable poem by Professor New
comer on the Memorial Church.
There will be poems by such older
men of the University as C. K.
Field,'9s, W.H. Irwin,'99, and Wal
lace Irwin, ex-'OO, and also by stu
dents in the University. The aim
of the editors has been to syste
matize thoroughly the work of the
book, and accordingly everything
will be in its proper place and
there will be no miscellaneous de
partment. All the different depart
ments will be separated by full-page
drawings made on heavy manilla
parchment of a yellow tone. The
part devotdd to the new Memorial
Church will be especially complete,
and will contain a series of beauti
ful photographs of the interior and
exterior of the building. The cover
of the book will be of green, loose
woven canvas, and will have a
very simple design, while in the
coiner will be the lettering "The
Quad, Stanford, 1903." There will
be a title-page in four colors, and a
frontispiece in the form of a photo
graphic print, pasted on a heavy
buff gauges paper, of the
Honorable S. F. Leib, to whom the
book is dedicated. There will be
only about twenty pages of joshes,
as the editors have favored the re
duction of this feature, and few of
them will be severe. The Quad will
contain about 325 pages, while the
California annual, which has 500
pages, devoted 175 to joshes. There

will be two color plates of two
windows in the Memorial Church,
"The Annunciation'' and"The
Warning of Pilate's Wife," audit
will contain a complete facsimile of
the deed of grant, while other nu
merous excellent features will com
bine to make the book one of the
best yet published by a junior class.
The Quad board is made up of
Ralph E. Renaud, '03, editor,
Chester A. Naramore, business man
ager, and H. R. Johnson, P. Parker,
R. Keith, E. Warfield, C. I). Mc-
Cornish, R. Leib, Miss A. B. Perrin,
Miss M. H. Brown, and Miss R.
Taylor, all members of the class of
1903. Concerning the Quad, Henry
H. Taylor of the Stanley-Taylor
Company, by whom it is printed,
has the following to say:
"There has been such a quantity
of color work, and elaborate de
signs at that, as to make me think
that this Quad will surprise some
people by its innovations. I have
not seen any annual issued this
year (and we get all the college
annuals) that begins to approach
it in range and variety of inter
est."
