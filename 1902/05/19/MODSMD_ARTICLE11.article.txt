Following the custom of former
years, the Daily Palo Alto will
publish a Commencement edition
next week, which will be on sale
the day of the graduation exercises.
Last spring the commencement
number was omitted because of the
poor condition of the paper's busi
ness and the unwillingness of those
who had the management at that
time to assume any further respon
sibility. The edition this year will
follow the plan of previous num
bers being devoted to the Com
mencement addresses of President
Jordan and Professor Murray
which will be printed in full, a
complete list of the graduates, and
short accounts of each of the fea
tures of Commencement week.
Subscriptions may be left at the
Daily Palo Alto office at any time
this week, and orders may be sent
by mail. It is important for these
orders to be made in advance, as

the number of papers printed will
be gauged largely by the number
of subscriptions received. The
price of the paper will be ten cents.
