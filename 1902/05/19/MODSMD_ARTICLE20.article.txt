# LARGE CROWD ATTENDED.
## Elizabethan Carnival on Friday Inaugurated.â€”New Feature of Stanford Life. 
### 
Friday was Carnival-day at Stan
ford, and on the shores of Lagunita
the combined Christian associations
inaugurated a new feature in college
life. Considering the fact that this
was the first attempt to provide such
a fete here, the entertainment was a
success, and the associations, as well
as the individuals who conceived
and carried out the affair, are re
ceiving much praise for their under
taking. The gate receipts netted
each association over one hundred
dollars.
The day had promised to be per
fect, with a clear sky and warm sun,
but a strong wind made the after
noon unpleasant. Many people,
however, were there to witness the
water sports, the Punch and Judy
show, the May-pole dance, and the
decorations about the grounds, as
well as to listen to the music, have
their fortunes told, take refresh
ments, and go boating. Late in the
afternoon a number of faculty boys
dressed in pretty Robin Hood cos
tumes took part in archery contest.
The water polo game was a novel
spectacle to most of the on-lookers.
The men who took part in it were
Chad bourne, Dole, Luck, Hess, Fay,
Swinerton, Wintler, Firebaugh,
Copp, Lousley, and Dougherty.
One tilting match was held between
Lyman and Hummel. The prom
ised pig race did not occur, as the
blue and gold beribboned shoat re
fused to swim. Harter, McComas,
M, P. Anderson, Thomas, Dough
erty, Wintler, and Long, who had
entered for this event, amused
themselves by swimming and div
ing from the boats.
A large number of gayly dressed
young ladies danced about the gar
landed May-pole to violin music in
the midst of a good-sized gathering,
and the girls' musical clubs fol
lowed soon after with selections on
the raft. The center of interest was
under the pine trees by the path
where were gathered together the
"Mermaid Inn," the candy-booth,
and the miniature theatre where
performances of the Punch and
Judy show were going on most of
the time. Many serving maids in
costume were kept busy serving
various kinds of Elizabethan cakes
with buns and coffee to the visitors,
and at the end of the path, at the
gypsy camp, three gypsy maids
were telling fortunes.
After the intermission of one
hour between the afternoon and
evening, as the darkness came on,
the shores of the lake became illum
inated. Ilising from the shallow
water all the way around
lighted torches glimmered on the
quiet lake, and a profusion of red
lanterns shone from the trees.
The people began to pour into the
grounds, and a Punch and Judy
show started the evening entertain
ment. A distant halooing called
attention to a long torch procession
winding around the lake, and mean
while the serving-maids and the
fortune-tellers were busied satisfy
ing the crowds of people who were
coming into the grounds.
Probably the most carefully pre
pared and most enjoyable feature
of the Carnival was the play of
Pyramus and Thisbe from "Mid
summer Night's Dream," given on
the raft before a large audience
between eight and nine o'clock. The
barge, moored by the shore, served

as the stage, and -the lighting was
furnished in primitive style by
torch hoys standing along either
side. The cast had been training
under Mr. Bassett for several weeks,
and it gave the performance most
creditably. The dramatis personae
were as follows:
Bottom, or I'yramus
C. D. McComish
Flute, or Thisbe I. J. Bounds
Quince H. F. Henderson
Snug, or Lion It. V. Anderson
Snout, or Wall C. L. Duncan
Starveling, or Moon ... .J. H. Page
The play was followed by tab
leaux in which Queen Elizabeth
and a number of her courtiers ap
peared, music by musical clubs,
skillful fencing bouts between cos
tumed members of the court, and
some excellent tumbling by the
Gym Club experts.
