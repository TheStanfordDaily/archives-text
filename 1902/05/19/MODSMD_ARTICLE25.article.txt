# "COMING TO ONE'S SELF."
## Professor Burt Estes Howard Gave a Most Thoughtful Discourse Yesterday. 
### 
In the chapel yesterday morning
Professor Burt Esles Howard gave
one of the most thoughtful sermons
he has [delivered at the University,
it was his lust public address here
before he goes to Europe. He took
for the theme "Coming to one's
self" and for the text "He came to
himself" from the parable of the
Prodigal Son.
"The parable of the prodigal son,
so familiar to us all, contains this
thought which is so often neg
lected," said Professor Howard. "It
is not the forgiveness of the father
nor is it the humbling of the pride
of the son which is the great motif
of this wonderful story but rather
it is the thought conveyed in the
simple words 'and he came to him
self.' It is the spiritual regenera
tion of the wanderer which is the
essence of the whole story.
"The theory that all young men
must 'see life,' as it is commonly
understood, is utterly wrong. It is
not true life but the refuse and
scum of real life, all that is corrupt
and harmful, — this is implied under
the phrase 'seeing life.' See life!
See life by all means, but not this
false play which masquerades
under that name, instead, see and
live the pure, true life fashioned
after that of Christ. This was the
mistake the Prodigal Son made.
He went in search of pleasure but
he found that such pleasures were
only the wrapping cases of trouble.
At last he awoke. There came a
home-sickness for his lost self re
spect and he came to himself.
"When, in a man's life, there
comes a crisis, the use he has made
of his past existence determines
whether or not he will come to him
self successfully or whether he will
realize with dizzying numbness
that he is to be a failure. This
question can be answered only by
the possession of an insight into
things which will enable one to dis
tinguish real life from its incidents
and accidents. A sophomore," said
Professor Howard, ''to use a very
personal example, is the hardest
man in college to teach because he
lacks this discerning insight. He
knows just enough to put wings on
his egotism and not enough to put
tail feathers on his judgment.
"It is through lack of insight to
tell us what real life is that we fall
away from I he truth. The chief
aim of the Master was that the
world should he instructed in life,
not in getting a living. But for us
the path is not clear. We pride
ourselves on what Jesus Christ did
not think a finger-snap. Our "rep
resentative" men are those of great
wealth, of enormous superficial val
ues, but a man who has no merit

except in what he owns is easily
annihilated.
"These desires are false and fleet
ing. Life is what we want, not the
false life hut that gained by man
hood, strength, virility, and truth.
It is a misfortune that so many
people grasp at the husk of life in
stead of at the kernel, that so many
exist only instead of living. To
live means to he thrilled by a sense
of spiritual vitality, tense, vibrat
ing effort, hard, intelligent, consist
ant endeavor. That is living and
that is the life which comes when
a man comes to himself. The scale
by which a man is measured is dis
tinctive from any other. He is
measured by the resemblance he
bears to God's image by his posses
sion of three elements, foreign to
anything else, the moral, spiritual,
and the intellectual. To come to
one's self is to see things in their
proper relations, to be clean souled,
tine brained and white hearted.
That is the kind of a man we all
can and must be. Success in life
is not measured by man's posses
sions, by his position nor even by
his deeds, but instead by the integ
rity of his motives and the fidelity
of his ideals."
Professor Howard closed by ex
pressing the hope that these
thoughts might appeal to all young
men. He breathed sincerity as he
asked that this, bis last talk with
Stanford men, might go home and
bear weight when the crucial test
should come to the lives of those
before him.
