# REMARKABLE CAREER ENDS.
## Bishop Taylor, Famous Methodist Missionary, Passed Away in Palo Alto. 
### 
William Taylor, bishop of the
Methodist Episcopal church, grand
father of S. L. Taylor, '04, and W.
R. Taylor, '05, died yesterday after
noon at 4:30, at the home of his
son, Ross Taylor, in Palo Alto. On
May 2d he celebrated his 81st birth
day. At that time he was in his
usual health, but a week ago was
taken with hemorrhage, and de
clined rapidly. The bishop had
been a resident in Palo Alto for
three years and a half. During
these years he has been in enforced
idleness from weakness resulting
from over thirty years of missionary
labor in tropical countries, and par
ticularly from the effects of a five
hundred mile trip on foot up the
Congo when in his 75th year.
Bishop Taylor has had the most
active, and in many respects the
most remarkable missionary career
of any man since Saint Paul. After
six years of circuit preaching in
his native State, Virginia, he
reached San Francisco in Septem
ber, 1849, and in the next seven
years established the work of his
church in this part of the State.
Since then he has carried the Gos
pel over every continent, the East
and West Indies and Australia,
South America, India, and Africa
being his most important fields. In
1884 he was elected bishop, and
given the African continent as his
diocese. This office he filled until
relieved in 1896 because of failing
health. Yet he returned to Africa
again, and in a trip through the
Cape and Transvaal made 1500
converts. When at Pretoria he
was the guest of President Krti
ger.
During his early years in Cali
fornia Bishop Taylor was known
everywhere to the sailors as Father
Taylor, going among them not only
as a preacher but as a nurse and
friend. In 1885, after a trip to San
Jose and Santa Cruz to establish
churches there, he was returning to
San Francisco on horseback when
he arrived at San Francisquito at
dusk the creek was swollen by the
rains and impassable, so he rode
toward the hills, passing the night
with three miners near the present
location of the Stock Farm. That
was the last time he saw the site
of Stanford University until he re
turned in 1898.
Bishop Taylor first sailed from
New York for San Francisco in
1849 with $950 from the missionary
society of his church. That was
the last money he received as sal
ary until he was elected bishop in
1884. All his travel and work in
the intervening years he supported
by his writing. He has published
a large number of works descrip
tive of his fields of labor.
He was a man of magnificent
physique, powerful voice, and a re
markable business sagacity. He
was the founder of the present sys
tem of self-supporting foreign mis
sions. Brief funeral services will be
conducted at 10:30 tomorrow morn
ing in the Methodist church, Palo
Alto, by the pastor, the Rev. Jen
ness.
