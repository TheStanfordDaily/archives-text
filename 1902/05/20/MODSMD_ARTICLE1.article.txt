# ALL WERE SOLD.
## "Quads" Disposed of this Morning Within Fifty Minutes' Time. The Features. 
### 
It was half-past nine this morn
ing before Manager Naramore and
his assistants began to sell the 1903
Quad to the long line of students
which had gathered at the north
entrance of the quadrangle during
the preceding hour and impatiently
awaited a chance to buy the an
nual. When the sale was actually
opened several persons, who had not
been in line, forced themselves up
to the improvised counter while the
file of people who had awaited their
turn were compelled to stand even
longer. At one end of the counter
books were disposed of to the gen
eral public, while at the other the
copies were given out to the mem
bers of the Junior class who had
made reservations. One book only
was sold to each applicant. With
in fifty minutes after the sale com
menced every available book was
gone, and a disappointed crowd of
those who had been unable to make
a purchase walked helplessly
away.
The Quad is of especial value be
cause of the high grade of the art
work, and of the historical nature
of the illustrations and data with
reference to the past decade and
growth of the present year. The
pictures of the Memorial Church
and of the campus are excellent.
The arrangement of material in the
book is an improvement over pre
vious annuals. The compara
tively small number of joshes,
none of which are hard, add to the
dignity of the book as a permanent
record because of their inconspic
uousness.
The chief blemish of the publica
tion is found in the large number
of typographical errors and mis
takes in initials and data, which
seem to have been due both to poor
proof-reading and to inaccuracy in
preparing material.
The remarkable feature about the
art work is that while remaining
strictly amateur, and almost en
tirely collegiate, it strikes such a
high standard of excellence. There
is not a single drawing in the book
which could not secure a place
along with the best professional
work. Beyond the conception of
the drawings, which are bright and
original, such as one would expect
from college students, a surprising
technical ability is evinced. Of the
larger full pages those which pre
tend to be serious are carried out
with dignity and power. Through
out there is shown a reserve and
good taste which is carried into the
finer features of the book, making
seeming complete harmony and a
good setting for good work. Some
of the newer members of the art
clientelle deserve particular men
tion, as their work easily ranks be
side that which Stanford people
have learned to recognize.
On the literary side, the book
gives evidence of careful considera
tion. Nothing is needlessly in
serted, and every thing has its place.
The two poems by Carolus Ager
anil "Hill" Irwin are very strong
and beautiful, and Wallace Irwin's
ballade on the reformed editor gives

the editor's point of view with much
pathos. Professor Newcomer's mu
sical verse on the Memorial Church
is replete with the higher spirit of
the University, and will long re
main in the hearts of Stanford
men. Of the literary contributions
from the student body, J. K. Bon
nell's "The Soul's Quest" is a mys
tical lyric which shows not only
complete mastery of verse form and
music but deep poetic appreciation
ae well. The prize story, "When
the President Culls," is a clever
domestic skit quite different from
Miss Ellerbeck's psychological
study of a beautiful co-ed and a
susceptible professor.
The feature articles by Dr. Jor
dan and Dr. Elliott get at the very
core of college levelopment both as
to living ideals and growing tradi
tions. Dr. Angell is also repre
sented by an article which will do
much to strengthen the athletic
spirit. Charles Cantwell's review
of athletics and Frank English's
review of debating both show a broad
comprehension and a common
sense attitude.
The annual is one of the most
successful pieces of book-making
that we have seen at the Univer
sity. The cover is quiet and taste
ful, and from the soft brown end
papers through the rich buff
of the frontispiece to the neutral
tints of the title page, is a very sat
isfying gradation.
