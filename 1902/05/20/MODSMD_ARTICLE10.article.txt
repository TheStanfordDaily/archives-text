# An American Henley.

"The idea of an American Re
gatta on the lines of the great Hen
ley Regatta in England, which has
been discussed for some years, has
at last taken definite shape," says
the Daily Pennsylvanian, "and at
a meeting held in New York City
on May 10th the American Rowing
Association was formed to hold a
big amateur regatta annually on
the Schuylkill River. Representa
tives were present from Pennsyl
vania, Yale, Harvard, Cornell, and
Columbia, and the regatta will be
held principally for college oars
men and graduates, although no
such qualifications will be imposed.
The rules of the present National
Association will be followed, and
the program of races will be much
the same."
