A fac-simile copy of the New
Testament, which was presented to
the Empress Dowager of China,
has been added to the Theolgical
Seminary at Princeton. It is
printed in Chinese, and bound in
morrocco, with solid gold clasps.
The book was published at Oxford,
and is the only one of its kind in
this country. It is the gift of Mrs.
John Stronach of Philadelphia, to
whom it was presented by the
British and Foreign Bible Society
in recognition of the services of her
husband in making the translation
into Chinese.
