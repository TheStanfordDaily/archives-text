In last week's issues of one of
the weekly newspapers printed in
Palo Alto there were four articles,
approximating a thousand words,
which, although published osten
sibly as original matter, were lifted
bodily from the columns of the
Daily I'ai.o Alto. Three of these
articles were reprint even to the
headlines. Our other contempor
ary also borrowed generously from
the Daily in making up its last is
sue. The situation is somewhat

anomalous when a purely amateur
journal covering so restricted a
field as the Daily Palo Alto should
be compelled to remind veteran
newspaper men that it is a custom
among the fraternity to acknowl
edge carefully all borrowed ma
terial.
