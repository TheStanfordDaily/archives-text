# SEATS FOR THE FARCE.
## Tickets Were Placed on Sale This Morning. â€” 600 Taken Up to Three O'clock. 
### 
Seats for the Senior Farce were
placed on sale on the quad this
morning, and the indications so far
point to a very large attendance.
A long line was in waiting when
the sale began. About six hundred
tickets were taken up to three
o'clock.
Rehearsals for the Farce are the
order of the day of late, and already
such progress has been made that
excellent work is assured from the
cast, orchestra, and chorus. Special
scenery of striking design has been
prepared in San Francisco for the
play, and the staging has been pre
pared with a view to completeness
rather than expense. Novel effects
are promised in the way of electri
cal illumination. Authorities who
have witnessed the rehearsals are
enthusiastic over the cleverness of
the farce, and the performance of
the cast, which has been selected
with unusual discrimination. A
full synopsis of the play will appear
in tomorrow's paper.
