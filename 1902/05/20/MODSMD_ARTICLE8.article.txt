# Ramsey's Spanish Grammar.

### 
Professor M. M. Ramsey's new
grammar, which will hereafter be
used in all the Spanish classes, has
just been published by Holt & Co.
It is not too much to say its ap
pearance is the event of the year of
its kind. Of Ramsey's Text-book
of Modern Spanish, which this suc
ceeds, the conservative New York
Nation said in an extended review:
"Although as a rule we do not
notice grammars, we mention this
book because of the very great ad
vance it shows over all existing
Spanish grammars in English." It
may be added that this new work
surpasses the other almost as much
as that did its forerunners. The
proverb says imitation is the sin
cerest flattery, and the abject plag
iarism of all Spanish grammars
published since the Text-book ap
peared has amply justified the
proverb. No doubt the grammar
will have the same sort of atten
tion.
The new book is not an abridg
ment of the earlier one, although
modeled after it in part. The ele
mentary portion of the Text-book
has been expanded and more fully
elucidated, while the advanced part
iB reduced to mere essentials; about
one-half of the Text-book has been
cut out and the rest enlarged to
five-sixths of its whole. The vocab
ulary and the exercises are double
instead of single, the lessons shorter,
and exercises longer. The Gram
mar contains the first entirely clear
and adequate explanation ever
printed in English of such vexed
questions as those of ser and estar,
the personal accusative, imperfect
and preterit; para and por, the
passive and reflexive; idomatic
use of prepositions, and many
others.
Hut of interesting features the
most salient is doubtless the skil
ful wording of the exercises, which
are fresh, colloquial, useful, and
carefully illustrative of the text —
speech, in fact, and not the pu«rile
jargon so unpleasantly familiar to

students. Another valuable feature
is the clear wording of the text.
Professor Ramsey's work shows
throughout that it has not been
hurriedly prepared on the demand
of some hard-pressed publisher; it
is, indeed, the result of long prepar
ation, and, while suited to the need
of beginners, will be very useful to
those well versed in the language.
