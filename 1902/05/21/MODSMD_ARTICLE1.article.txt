# ENTER THE PLAYERS.
## Senior Farce, "The Rank Outsider," to be Staged Tomorrow Night. Advance Sale Large. 
### 
In Assembly Hall tomorrow
night festivities of Commencement
week are to be inaugurated with
the presentation of the Senior Farce,
"The Rank Outsider," written by
Roger J. Sterrett, '02, anil staged un
der the direction of Mrs. Will H.
Irwin, '98. The advance sale of
seats has thus far been a record
breaker, the cleverness of the play
and the strength of the cast hav
ing proved a combination from
which success is seemingly assured.
"The Rank Outsider," as has been
suggested before, is a departure from
the type of play that has been uti
lized by the classes during the past
few years. Although a burlesque,
it is not an extravaganza. The
scenes are familiar to Stanford
people, and an endeavor has been
made to represent incidents and
characters that will be recognized,
in spite of exaggerations, as pecu
liar to Stanford life. Following
is the synopsis of the acts and
scenes:
Act I. — Scene: Quadrangle.
Time: Two days before spring stu
dent body elections.
Act II. —Scene: The garden fete
cf the Kappa Rho fraternity on the
shore of Lagunita. Time: The
night of the same day as Act I.
Act 111. —Scene First: Stoddard's
room in Encina. Time: Night be
fore election. Scene Second: Same
room, decorated for an Encina "at
home." Time: Night after election.
The story of the misadventures
of the "Rank Outsider" revolves
about a student body election and
is further complicated by a painted
plug, queening, cutting, knocking,
Durham, kisses, pretzels and beer,
and other stock properties' of the
college playwright. Two opposing
political factions, the secret Knock
ers' Club, whose candidate for stu
dent body president is a popular
football man from Encina, and the
Kappa Rho fraternity with their
own man to support, are plunged
into a quarrel by the prime inno
cence of the Kappa Rho freshman,
Bert Pinkerley, whose devotion to
Kathryne, the irresistible Senior
queen, has put his neck under the
ax. At this point Colonel Robert
S. Gibbs, of the "Dead Coyote
Crude Petroleum," with the alkali
dust of Kern county still sticking
to his boots, falls into the play with
characteristic aplomb, is seized
upon by the Kappa Rhos as an
available dummy candidate to
split up the Knocker vote, and
throughout the rest of the play the
catastrophes heap themselves upon
his head as he proves himself in
every situation the "Rank Out
sider." But in the course of
his short and fearful career
as "just one of the boys" be
is initiated into the Kappa Rho
fraternity by mistake. lie is
ducked, abducted and shut up in
the tunnels by the Knockers, and
finally elected president of the stu
dent body by a margin of two
votes.
The pace becomes entirely too
hot. After a discovery of and re

conciliation with Bert Pinkerley as
his nephew, Gibbs solves the com
plication of the plot at the crucial
moment by escaping from his
prison, appearing in time to save
both villains (there are no heroes)
and declaring that he is "clone be
ing a college boy for good" because,
as there was nothing in college that
he had not been given already, "lie
knew when to pull out of a game
ahead." The plot is startlingly
complicated by the machinations
of the special reporter, the educa
tion major, the mystery of the yel
low dog, and the "Battle-Ax Brig
ade" of Knockers.
The musical features of the farce
will be unusually striking, embrac
ing songs and music prepared for
tlie occasion by well known Stan
ford writers. The music has been
adapted with great success from
the very latest Eastern operatic
hits.
The chorus has been working
night and day, and has reached a
state of perfection. The first act
will begin with the opening chorus,
and a solo by C. L. Firebaugh, '04,
entitled "The Chimes." The words
for this have been written by li. J.
Sterrett, '02, and the music adapted
by Miss Hurlburt. In this act there
will also be a solo by 11. E. War
field, '03, and chorus under the
name-piece of the farce, "The Rank
Outsider," with the words by Ster
rett and music from Maid Mar
ion.
The second act will open with
the song, "Our College Love is
Past," by the chorus. Miss Hurl
burt has written the words to this
with music from the opera King
Dodo. The "Rank Outsider," Wal
demar Young, will sing "The Typi
cal College Man," written by R. J.
Sterrett,'o2, and F. B. Wagner,'o2,
to music from King Dodo. One of
the best features of this act will be
the Knockers' Chorus in the "Ter
rors of the Quad," with words by
Larrey Bowman, '01. This is also
written to music from King Dodo.
The finale of the second act will be
a solo by Waldemar Young, with
a choral accompaniment.
The Knockers' Chorus will start
the third act. Assisted by the
chorus, Miss Sue Bird, '08, will
sing a solo entitled "My Freshman
Queen." Miss Hurlburt and R. J.
Sterrett have written the words to
this, and have adopted the music
from the comic opera Foxy Grand
pa, which has been running in
New York the past winter with
great success.
The grand finale to the farce
will consist of a solo by Firebaugh,
'04, assisted by the chorus. R. J.
Sterrett has written the words to
this also.
The musical director is Miss
Hurlburt, and the orchestra leader
is A. Copp, Jr., '02.
Special attention has been paid
to stage effects throughout (be play.
Special scenery has been secured,
and during the second act real
palms and foliage will be used for
decorations. During the same act
a calcium light is to be turned on
the stage. At each intermission
there is a change of costume for
the entire cast and chorus, and over
forty people participate in the
spectacular climax of every act.

the type of play that has been uti
lized by the classes during the past
few years. Although a burlesque,
it is not an extravaganza. The
scenes are familiar to Stanford
people, and an endeavor has been
made to represent incidents and
characters that will be recognized,
in spite of exaggerations, as pecu
liar to Stanford life. Following
is the synopsis of the acts and
scenes:
Act I. — Scene: Quadrangle.
Time: Two days before spring stu
dent body elections.
Act II. —Scene: The garden fete
cf the Kappa Rho fraternity on the
shore of Lagunita. Time: The
night of the same day as Act I.
Act 111. —Scene First: Stoddard's
room in Encina. Time: Night be
fore election. Scene Second: Same
room, decorated for an Encina "at
home." Time: Night after election.
The story of the misadventures
of the "Rank Outsider" revolves
about a student body election and
is further complicated by a painted
plug, queening, cutting, knocking,
Durham, kisses, pretzels and beer,
and other stock properties' of the
college playwright. Two opposing
political factions, the secret Knock
ers' Club, whose candidate for stu
dent body president is a popular
football man from Encina, and the
Kappa Rho fraternity with their
own man to support, are plunged
into a quarrel by the prime inno
cence of the Kappa Rho freshman,
Bert Pinkerley, whose devotion to
Kathryne, the irresistible Senior
queen, has put his neck under the
ax. At this point Colonel Robert
S. Gibbs, of the "Dead Coyote
Crude Petroleum," with the alkali
dust of Kern county still sticking
to his boots, falls into the play with
characteristic aplomb, is seized
upon by the Kappa Rhos as an
available dummy candidate to
split up the Knocker vote, and
throughout the rest of the play the
catastrophes heap themselves upon
his head as he proves himself in
every situation the "Rank Out
sider." But in the course of
his short and fearful career
as "just one of the boys" be
is initiated into the Kappa Rho
fraternity by mistake. lie is
ducked, abducted and shut up in
the tunnels by the Knockers, and
finally elected president of the stu
dent body by a margin of two
votes.
The pace becomes entirely too
hot. After a discovery of and re

conciliation with Bert Pinkerley as
his nephew, Gibbs solves the com
plication of the plot at the crucial
moment by escaping from his
prison, appearing in time to save
both villains (there are no heroes)
and declaring that he is "clone be
ing a college boy for good" because,
as there was nothing in college that
he had not been given already, "lie
knew when to pull out of a game
ahead." The plot is startlingly
complicated by the machinations
of the special reporter, the educa
tion major, the mystery of the yel
low dog, and the "Battle-Ax Brig
ade" of Knockers.
The musical features of the farce
will be unusually striking, embrac
ing songs and music prepared for
tlie occasion by well known Stan
ford writers. The music has been
adapted with great success from
the very latest Eastern operatic
hits.
The chorus has been working
night and day, and has reached a
state of perfection. The first act
will begin with the opening chorus,
and a solo by C. L. Firebaugh, '04,
entitled "The Chimes." The words
for this have been written by li. J.
Sterrett, '02, and the music adapted
by Miss Hurlburt. In this act there
will also be a solo by 11. E. War
field, '03, and chorus under the
name-piece of the farce, "The Rank
Outsider," with the words by Ster
rett and music from Maid Mar
ion.
The second act will open with
the song, "Our College Love is
Past," by the chorus. Miss Hurl
burt has written the words to this
with music from the opera King
Dodo. The "Rank Outsider," Wal
demar Young, will sing "The Typi
cal College Man," written by R. J.
Sterrett,'o2, and F. B. Wagner,'o2,
to music from King Dodo. One of
the best features of this act will be
the Knockers' Chorus in the "Ter
rors of the Quad," with words by
Larrey Bowman, '01. This is also
written to music from King Dodo.
The finale of the second act will be
a solo by Waldemar Young, with
a choral accompaniment.
The Knockers' Chorus will start
the third act. Assisted by the
chorus, Miss Sue Bird, '08, will
sing a solo entitled "My Freshman
Queen." Miss Hurlburt and R. J.
Sterrett have written the words to
this, and have adopted the music
from the comic opera Foxy Grand
pa, which has been running in
New York the past winter with
great success.
The grand finale to the farce
will consist of a solo by Firebaugh,
'04, assisted by the chorus. R. J.
Sterrett has written the words to
this also.
The musical director is Miss
Hurlburt, and the orchestra leader
is A. Copp, Jr., '02.
Special attention has been paid
to stage effects throughout (be play.
Special scenery has been secured,
and during the second act real
palms and foliage will be used for
decorations. During the same act
a calcium light is to be turned on
the stage. At each intermission
there is a change of costume for
the entire cast and chorus, and over
forty people participate in the
spectacular climax of every act.
In Assembly Hall tomorrow
night festivities of Commencement
week are to be inaugurated with
the presentation of the Senior Farce,
"The Rank Outsider," written by
Roger J. Sterrett, '02, anil staged un
der the direction of Mrs. Will H.
Irwin, '98. The advance sale of
seats has thus far been a record
breaker, the cleverness of the play
and the strength of the cast hav
ing proved a combination from
which success is seemingly assured.
