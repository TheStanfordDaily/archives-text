# WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED.
## Review of the Inn for tile Semester. More Members Are Needed. 
### 
The members of the University
Inn Club met last evening and
listened to a review of the business
of the organization given by Presi
dent Harter. It was decided to re
lease the Inn for next semester, but
the membership at the start must
be at leaßt 140 men to insure the
success of the project.
Two amendments to the consti
tution were adopted, and a vote of
thanks was given to the directors
for their ability and self-sacrifice
in the management. A full state
ment of what has been accomp
lished by the Inn during the pres
ent semester, and of the present
status of the business, has been
prepared by the directors, and fol
lows:
"When a co-operative dining
scheme was proposed last semester
it was very seriously questioned
whether it would be safe to launch
such a business at the middle of
the year and attempt to carry it
successfully through the spring
semester, which is a most precari
ous season for such a project. The
men interested in the affair con
sidered, however, that with one
hundred regular boarders the plan
could be carried through.
"The experience of this semester's
run is summed up as follows: The
Inn began with ninety-one regular
boarders. As soon as things were
in working order the satisfaction of
the members with their new dining
scheme was general. It was be
lieved that when the co-operative
plan proved itself to be a perman
ent success the sale of tickets would
increase. The shifting of students,
which occurs to the greatest extent
during the last two months of the
year, and the general indisposition
of the men, due to long continued
work, not only kept the sale of
tickets down, but actually reduced
the number of boarders. Having
a surplus of $180 after the first
three months run, with all bills
paid, the board undertook to avert
any further decrease in boarders by
a reduction of the price of meal
tickets from $4 to $3.75. The causes
which were reducing the num
ber of boarders were not in the Inn,
and the gradual decrease continued.
The last week of April only seventy
tickets were sold. This falling
seriously threatened the business.
In lieu of raising the price of tick
ets to the original rate, some cur
tailments were made in the ex
penses, involving a little change in
the bill of fare. Calculations have
been so carefully made that the
club will close up the business this
year without a deficit, notwith
standing the fact that the scheme
was set on foot at a very inoppor
tune season, when there is always
a natural falling off, that the stu
dents were unaccustomed to the
business, that the membership was
not as large at any time as was ex
pected, and that the scheme was at
best only an experiment.
"The results of the experiment
may be summed up as follows:
The Inn Club has paid this semester
$300 per month for salaries, and

boarded twenty-five men in return
for services; paid $82.50 per month
for rent, invented $400 in perma
nent fixtures, and met expenses in
cident to organization to the
amount of $60. With this outlay,
which is separate from table supply,
and will remain about the same
with a membership twice as large
—the items of permanent fixtures
and organization not appearing at
all next year—the club with an
average monthly receipt of $1,600
has set a more satisfactory table
than has ever been provided under
private management, and at a very
much lower price. Especially
satisfactory was the board at the be
ginning of the semester, when the
boarders numbered ninety. That
the tables have been as satisfactory
during the last two months as they
have is strong evidence of the
soundness of the co-operative plan,
for the sale of tickets has decreased
to seventy per week and each man
has been receiving his board, on ac
count of rebates, not for $3.75 but
for about $3.50 per week, or less
than $15 per month.
<l Now it seems very plain that if
by the present scheme the Inn
could furnish good board with
ninety members, as was the case
at the beginning of the semester;
invest $400 in fixtures and inci
dentals; and if it could keep from
going bankrupt with only seventy
boarders, paying an average of only
$3.50 per week—as was the case the
last two months —the co-operative
scheme opens the way for the most
satisfactory, the cheapest, and al
together the most successful dining
plan.
"The Board has accumulated
some valuable experience, and in
novations will be made next year
which will add very much to the
service and variety. If, next year,
the Inn can commence business
with one hundred and forty mem
bers, the receipts will be $2500 per
month, the fixed expendituress4oo,
leaving $2100 for table per month,
which is $3 per member more than
has been devoted to the table this
semester."

boarders. As soon as things were
in working order the satisfaction of
the members with their new dining
scheme was general. It was be
lieved that when the co-operative
plan proved itself to be a perman
ent success the sale of tickets would
increase. The shifting of students,
which occurs to the greatest extent
during the last two months of the
year, and the general indisposition
of the men, due to long continued
work, not only kept the sale of
tickets down, but actually reduced
the number of boarders. Having
a surplus of $180 after the first
three months run, with all bills
paid, the board undertook to avert
any further decrease in boarders by
a reduction of the price of meal
tickets from $4 to $3.75. The causes
which were reducing the num
ber of boarders were not in the Inn,
and the gradual decrease continued.
The last week of April only seventy
tickets were sold. This falling
seriously threatened the business.
In lieu of raising the price of tick
ets to the original rate, some cur
tailments were made in the ex
penses, involving a little change in
the bill of fare. Calculations have
been so carefully made that the
club will close up the business this
year without a deficit, notwith
standing the fact that the scheme
was set on foot at a very inoppor
tune season, when there is always
a natural falling off, that the stu
dents were unaccustomed to the
business, that the membership was
not as large at any time as was ex
pected, and that the scheme was at
best only an experiment.
"The results of the experiment
may be summed up as follows:
The Inn Club has paid this semester
$300 per month for salaries, and

boarded twenty-five men in return
for services; paid $82.50 per month
for rent, invented $400 in perma
nent fixtures, and met expenses in
cident to organization to the
amount of $60. With this outlay,
which is separate from table supply,
and will remain about the same
with a membership twice as large
—the items of permanent fixtures
and organization not appearing at
all next year—the club with an
average monthly receipt of $1,600
has set a more satisfactory table
than has ever been provided under
private management, and at a very
much lower price. Especially
satisfactory was the board at the be
ginning of the semester, when the
boarders numbered ninety. That
the tables have been as satisfactory
during the last two months as they
have is strong evidence of the
soundness of the co-operative plan,
for the sale of tickets has decreased
to seventy per week and each man
has been receiving his board, on ac
count of rebates, not for $3.75 but
for about $3.50 per week, or less
than $15 per month.
<l Now it seems very plain that if
by the present scheme the Inn
could furnish good board with
ninety members, as was the case
at the beginning of the semester;
invest $400 in fixtures and inci
dentals; and if it could keep from
going bankrupt with only seventy
boarders, paying an average of only
$3.50 per week—as was the case the
last two months —the co-operative
scheme opens the way for the most
satisfactory, the cheapest, and al
together the most successful dining
plan.
"The Board has accumulated
some valuable experience, and in
novations will be made next year
which will add very much to the
service and variety. If, next year,
the Inn can commence business
with one hundred and forty mem
bers, the receipts will be $2500 per
month, the fixed expendituress4oo,
leaving $2100 for table per month,
which is $3 per member more than
has been devoted to the table this
semester."
