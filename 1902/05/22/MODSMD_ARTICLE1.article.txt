# FESTIVITIES BEGIN.
## The 						Senior Week Events Were Inaugurated This Evening. The Programs. 
### 
Commencement Week began
with the close of University work
today and the production this
evening of the 1902 Farce in As
sembly Hall, and the festivities
will continue until the final leave
taking next Wednesday. A large
audience witnessed the successful
production of R.J. Sterrett's three
act farce. A full account of its
production will be printed in the
Commencement number of the
Palo Alto.
The Senior Week programs are
unusually attractive this year.
They are bound in handsome red
leather with gold-leaf titles. An
inner binding of fancy paper, which
has never been tried before, lends
a finished effect to the programs.
The deckle-edged paper contains
the names of all the graduates and
those taking advanced degrees. On
the first page there is a stamped
engraving of the chapel taken from
within the arcade and showing the
ivy to great advantage. All the
committees of Senior Week are
given.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
President and Mrs. Jordan will
give a reception to the Senior Class
at Roble Hall. In the evening the
Seniors will tender a Smoker to the
Alumni, at Menlo Park.
Class Day, Saturday, will open
with the Class Day exercises in the
chapel.
A neat program has been gotten
out for the Plate exercises, to be
given at 11:30 a.m., at which Her
bert C. Jones will deliver the pre
sentation address, and President
Jordan will accept the plate with a
short reply.
On Saturday evening at 8:30
will be given the reception of the
Senior Class to the Faculty and
the students in Encina club-room.
The committee wishes it distinctly
understood that dancing is not to
commence until 10 o'clock.
The Baccalaureate Sermon will
be delivered in Assembly Hall, at
11 a.m. Sunday, by the Rev. Fred
erick W. Clampett, D. D., of San
Francisco.
At 7:45 p.m., in the chapel, the
Christian Associations hold their
anniversary exercises, when the
Rev. Charles R. Brown, of Oakland,
will give a short address.
The annual baseball game be
tween the Faculty and the Seniors
will be played on the baseball dia
mond at 10:30 a.m. on Monday.
The great social event of the
graduating festivities will be the
Senior Ball on Monday evening at
9 o'clock, in Encina club-room.
The decoration committee has been
at work some time planning novel
and harmonious effects. Yanke's
orchestra of twenty pieces will play
the dance music for thirty num
bers, and during intermissions a
stringed band will play. The pro
grams for the ball are in the shape
of tan leather card-cases, silk-lined,
with a '02 plate stamped in gold
leaf on the outside, which is an
entirely new idea at Stanford.
Tuesday will be Alumni Day.
A neat program, whose covers

represent a senior maiden with cap
and gown, has been prepared for
the Promenade Concert, which is to
begin in the quadrangle at 8 p.m.,
Tuesday. Yanke's band of forty
five pieces will play in the band
stand erected in the center of the
quad.
The final events in the life of the
Senior Class will take place on
Wednesday, opening at 10:30 a.m.,
in Assembly Hall. The Commence
ment address will be delivered by
Professor Augustus Taber Murray,
of the Greek department. This
will be followtd by the conferring
of the degrees by Registrar Elliott
and the address to the graduating
class by President Jordan. With
these exercises the activities of the
Class of 1902 at Stanford cease.
