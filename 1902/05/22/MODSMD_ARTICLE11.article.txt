With the exception of the Com
mencement edition —in some re
spects a special number —the pres
ent issue of the Daily Palo Alto
is the last one under the existing
editorial control. No one can be
more conscious than the writer of
shortcomings and defects of the
paper and of the mistakes that
have been made. It has been the
aim to cover the news field within
the University as in the past—in a
direct, efficient manner. With the
most loyal and energetic staff in
the history of the Daily Palo Alto
since it came under the writer's
observation, this has been a com
paratively easy task, notwithstand
ing the larger number of issues
printed and the greater amount of
space to be filled. Furthermore,
the semester seems to have been
one of unusual activity in under
graduate affairs. Whatever failure
may be evident in the attempt to
cover this field is due entirely to
ineffective direction of the forces,
not to the staff of assistants. At
considerable sacrifice of time and
energy, these men make the Daily
Palo Alto possible, receiving no
return except a scant recognition
for tbeir services by students gen
erally, and the possibility of at
some time securing the position of
editor-in-chief. The names at the
head of the editorial column every
day do not indicate any honorary
positions or sinecures, but are
placed there as an evidence of good,
hard, effective work being done
every day.
For the editor-in-chief, who is
favored with a willing corps of co

workers and lias merely to follow
the precedents found expedient by
the experience of his predecessors,
the responsibility is a pleasant one,
and it is not without some feeling
of reluctance that he severs his con
nection from an interest with which
he has been identified for some
years. Under the present regime,
no attempt has been made to agree
with any one nor to suit any fac
tion nor interest. Although errors
may have been made in judgment
in the expression of opinions, which
have at times seemed necessary, the
intention has been only to serve
the welfare of the student body and
the University.
Problems will arise in the future
with regard to the plan of manage
ment for the Daily and other ques
tions of conduct. These should be
worked out with care and conserv
atism, and will be discussed during
the coming years. The next regu
lar publication of the paper in Sep
tember will be under the direction
of the new editor, Thoreau Cronyn,
whose ability and long identity
with the Daily Palo Alto have
contributed in a large measure to
whatever success the paper has at
tained for several semesters past.
