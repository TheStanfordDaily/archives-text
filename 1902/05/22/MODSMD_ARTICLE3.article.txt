The calabash bowl presented by
the Stanford students of Hawaii to
Mrs. Stanford, on her recent visit
to the Islands, has arrived at the
Museum and will soon be placed
among the other curios.
The bowl is of native cao wood
fourteen inches in height and one
foot across the top and base. It is
finished in natural wood with a
piano gloss, which brings the vari
ations of shading into vivid con
trast.
The Hawaiian coat of arms done
in enamel is attached to the bowl,
which is a shield-shaped plate of
silver bearing the words: "Pre
sented to Mrs. Stanford with the
aloha (good will) of the Stanford
men and women of Hawaii, Hono
lulu, April 28, 1902."
