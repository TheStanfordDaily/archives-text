# THE 						CAMPUS.
## A 						Number of Buildings to be Completed Before the Opening of Next Semester. 
### 
The coming summer will Bee the
beginning of construction work on
a larger and grander scale than litis
before been undertaken at Stanford.
New buildings are to be started
and improvements are to be put
through. A great deal of the build
ing work already under way will
be rushed to completion during the
summer months, and, barring the
possibility of strikes and unex
pected delays, the students who re
turn next September will have dif
ficulty in recognizing the campus
upon their return.
The erection of the new gymna
sium is most interesting to all stu
dents. Ground will be broken for
the foundations about July Ist, and
the cornerstone will be laid by the
students sometime in the fore part
of September. Some delay has
been caused by changes in the
plans. The detail or working
drawings are being prepared and
considerable variations have been
made in the exterior plan. The
original sketch submitted called for
a facade of eighteen columns. Later
ideas have reduced the number to
about ten, and the desire has been to
make the front of the building more
compressed,extending the structure
farther to the rear. The new plan
calls fora more • beautiful edifice,
and still retains the classical Gre
cian style. Several changes of vast
importance to the outdoor features
of athletics have been made. At
the laying of the cornerstone by
the undergraduates, Mrs. Stanford
will be present to assist in the cere
monies of starting the work on
what will be one of the finest ath
letic homes in the United States.
The architects are still working
npon the detail drawings for the
large additions to the Museum.
The stonework will commence in
all probability some time in July,
and when completed the floor area
of the Museum will be more than
doubled.
The buildings in the facade of
the outer quad are being finished
as rapidly as the carpenters are
able to do the work. The History
and Economics buildings, adjoining
the Library, are yet to be plastered.
The wood work will go in rapidly,
and the departments will have no
trouble in moving in next Septem
ber. The basement of this building
is to provide permanent offices for
the Sequoia and Chaparral. The
work on all buildings in the facade
will be carried on with the same
degree of speed. There is a great
deal of work yet to be done in the
Natural Science and the Physics
buildings on the west of the arch,
and chances are that these depart
ments will not be able to move into
the quarters until late in the fall.
Disappointment has been ex
pressed because of the delay in the
finishing of the Chemistry building.
The completion of this structure is
already a year behind time, and
still the department will have to
wait until next Christmas before
taking charge of the building. The
interior wood facing iB nearly done
but the greater part of the chemical

fittings and apparatus lias not yet
been contracted for. The desks,
shelving, bookcases, drawers, etc.,
remain to go in, and this work will
take more time. The department
of Chemistry will occupy its build
ings in the inner quadrangle until
next Christmas. After its removal
both of the present laboratories will
be subdivided into recitation and
lecture rooms. The building now
occupied by the Qualitative and the
Quantitative laboratories will be
used by the Engineering depart
ment temporarily until the new
Engineering buildings are com
pleted.
The department of Hygiene will
find a permanent home in the
building now occupied by the Inor
ganic laboratory. When the
Physics department goes to its
building in the outer quadrangle,
the department of Education will
assume its quarters in the inner
quadrangle. Likewise the depart
ment of Romanic Languages will
move into the buildings vacated by
the History and Economics depart
ments. When the permanent homes
of all the sciences are completed
the inner quadrangle will be de
voted to recitation rooms en
tirely.
The cut-stone work on the Engi
neering building on the southeast
corner of the outer quadrangle is to
commence as soon as sufficient stone
is brought in. The foundations for
the Geology building, which is to
be located on the southwest corner
of the outer quad, are to be laid
shortly. Just as soon as the grad
ing back of Memorial Church is
finished, the foundations for the
arcade connecting the Geology and
Engineering buildings will be
started. This arcade will have a
continuous length of seven hun
dred feet. A stone retaining wall
is to be constructed in front of the
old Engineering buildings. The
land above will be terraced, and
the buildings will be approached
by stone steps. A street will run
between the arcade and the stone
wall.
Probably of more interest gener
ally to those who have been here
some time will be the destruction
of the buildings. There are
many traditions connected with
these frame structures. Put up
when work on the University was
first commenced, they have furn
ished the homes of many well
known Stanford students. While
many are loath to see the Camp go,
its removal haß been found neces
sary. The work of tearing it down
will begin as soon as all the stu
dents vacate their quarters. The
grounds will be levelled off to make
room for another street and new
houses.
Among the minor improvements
will be the replacing of the tin roof
on the Library with genuine tiles,
the beautifying of the grounds sur
rounding the University with ad
ditional palms and trees, the com
pletion of the new roads already
begun, and lastly, the construction
of the terrace wall in front of the
facade of the outer quadrangle.
Stone steps forty-four feet wide will
lead to the Arch, the ground in
front of the wall will be graded off,
| and trees and flowers planted.
