# PROFESSOR PEASE RESIGNS
## Head of the Latin Department Retires at Request of the President. 
### 
Professor Ernest Mendell Pease,
head of the Latin department, who
lias been a member of the Stanford
faculty since the University opened,
resigned on May 23d, in response
to a request from President Jordan
calling for his withdrawal by resig
nation from the faculty.
The action seems to be the cul
mination of troubles of long stand
ing, about which neither President
Jordan, Professor Pease, nor other
members of the faculty will say
anything. On Saturday, May 24th,
Professor Pease gave a long state
ment to the public press, reproduc
ing correspondence that took place
subsequent to the President's formal
request of his resignation in a letter
written March 29th.
When the correspondence was
made public President Jordan
would give nothing but the follow
ing brief statement:
"The removal of Professor Pease
was under consideration in 1896,
or earlier, and his resignation was
first asked for on December 18,
1897, long before the culmination
of the Ross episode. As to the
views of Eastern professors, it can
only be said that these gentlemen
have derived their information
through Professor Pease."
