# President Goes to Samoa.
## 
### 
President Jordan, accompanied
by Mrs. Jordan, will sail from San
Francisco June 12th for the island
of Tutuila, in the Samoan group,
where he will spend several weeks
investigating the fishes and marine
products of those waters, for the
United States Fish Commission.
He expects to reach here on his re
turn August 25th. Professor V. L.
Kellogg, who is to assist in the
investigations, has already left for
the South Seas.
This expedition is in line with
the work which Dr. Jordan did in
the Hawaiian Islands last summer,
and which remains to be done in
the Philippines. The trip to Sa
moa and back will require almost
as much time as the party will
have to spend on the island.
