# THE 						CLASS DAY EXERCISES.
## Address by President Hinman, Class History by Miss M. McDougald, 1902 Will by R.J. Sterrett.— H.C. Jones Gave Oration at Laying of Plate and President Jordan Responded. 
### 
The Class Day exercises were he
gun in the chapel at half-past ten
Saturday morning. A large crowd
was in attendance, and many peo
ple had to stand. Frank liin
nian, president of the graduating
class, gave an address of welcome
to everybody for the exercises of
the week, and of farewell to the col
lege on behalf of the class. Me
dwelt upon the fact that the pre
vailing feeling of the week would
be one of freedom and enjoyment.
"Undergraduatesseldom appreciate
their good times," he said, "until
the end of their college life. The
Seniors, innocent of the future, and
not comprehending the immediate
change in their lives, realize only
that the one great object for which
they have been striving for four
years —or it may he more —is at
last achieved. The prevailing idea
is one of freedom, it is with this
thought in mind that the Seniors
have so endeavored to plan the pro
gram for the week.
"It is not possible for us to ignore
altogether the fact that this week is
the last of our college life. During
these few days that are left we must
hid a lingering farewell to all the
old familiar places about which so
many pleasant memories linger.
The quadrangle and its lecture
rooms and laboratories, Lagunita,
the foothills, Frenchman's Lake,
the cactus garden, Adelante Villa,
Cooley's Landing, and the big Ar
boretum, will live as mere mind
pictures.
"We must also say good-bye to
professors and instructors, and to
our closest friends and associates.
Our impressions of Stanford Univer
sity as we will leave it have been
given us by these people, and it is
with regret that we leave them.
But we have every confidence in
the future of our Alma Mater, and
we are glad to know that the men
to whom this future is entrusted
are worthy of that confidence."
Miss Mary E. McDougald, class
historian, read the history, which
dealt with the annals of 1902 from
the day that its members came to
Stanford as freshmen up to the
present. It was as follows:
The Class History.
Our college life began that Sep
tember day in '98 when 359 in awe
alike of the authorities and the
upper-classmen trembling, filled out
our matriculation cards, and filed
out from the Registrar's presence
—the Freshman class of Naughty-
Two. There were no daring ad
venturous spirits among us —we
had no wild idea of painting our
numerals as a temptation to
doughty Sophomores — no such
audacious thought as class rushing
penetrated our minds; we were con
tent to enter quietly, unobtru
sively, becoming a part of Stanford
undergraduate life with as little
fuss and ceremony as possible, and
behaving as good children should,
being seen and not heard. Per
haps if it had been otherwise, if
in our midst there had been some
courageous youths who would have
infused into us a spirit of daring,

or fired us with the zeal of daring
things, there is really no telling
what we might have accomplished.
If we hadn't allowed ourselves to
be tied by the Sophomores, if we
had won our Freshman cane, if —
this history might have been a
record of deeds of prowess as yet
unheard. But '98 was the year of
the terrible slump, and as dutiful
Freshmen we went down before it.
It was not all gloom that year,
however. There was one bright
spot —the tennis was ours, and the
victor, Hardy, a Naughty-Two.
Our Sophomore year began as
inauspiciously as did our Fresh
man. The lusty Naughty-Three's
arrived with a swing and swirr,
but the Naughty-Two's were happy,
going quietly on in their own sweet
way, not caring particularly for
class contests and class victories,
but offering their youth and mus
cle for the Varsity. Rice was our
only man who made the team in
his freshman days, but when the
next year Stanford went up against
Berkeley in that never-to-be-for
gotten game, four Naught-Two
men were there, fighting and strug
gling till the last scrimmage. It
was the same story in the field-day,
— again Naughty-Two girt 011 their
armor, and won points for the Var
sity. Even now class champion
ship troubled us but little; we were
happy if the brawn and muscle of
our men went to the glory and honor
of the college. Suppose we have
the reputation of winning the largest
string of booby prizes ever drawn
in college! There has been but one
terrible slump at Stanford, but it
happened when we were being
initiated into college ways and
college customs, and who knows
but what we have suffered from
the reflection of those dark days.
But our Junior year opened
brightly. The heavy shadows that
had clouded our days as under
classmen were gone. Stanford had
recovered her spirits, hope was in
the air, Jack Reynold's new battle
cry, "On to 1900," was bearing
fruit, and again Naught-Two men
bore their part in the strife and
shared in the glories of victory.
With the dignity that befits upper
classmen we planned our Junior
year. We had come into man's
estate, we must do great things.
Wise in our day and generation
we bethought ourselves that the
mystic rites and solemn dedication
of our awful plug-ugly was our
chance to provide for our future.
The thought boldly conceived was
as boldly executed, and almost one
hundred dollars added to our bank
account. But Copp's reputation as
a class treasurer did not end here.
When, after one of the most success
ful Junior days ever held (and
others besides ourselves will agree
to this) the Class accounts were
published, and our riches revealed'.
The college public stood silent in
admiration. Over five hundred
dollars —a record breaker fora
Junior class. And lastly came the
annual, the Quad. So ended our
three years.
What of our last year at college?

We gave our men, as of yore, to
lead the Varsity in football and
baseball, and to bear its brunt in
the Held. For the first time in our
career Naught-Two men won their
little gold S, and fought for Stan
ford as gallantly and bravely as
have the athletes before them.
Think not, though, that our hon
ors have been won solely on the
field and in forensics. We have
borne our part of trials and tribu
lations as college editors; we have
had a goodly number of wondrous
politicians of various hues and de
signs; we have had singers and
actors galore, with a playright or
two thrown in. What more could
a class desire in the way of college
honors?
Now we stand on the eve of grad
uation, one hundred and seventy
of us, where four years ago there
were almost four hundred. The
all-seeing eye of the Registrar's as
sistant might detect strange hidden
truths were he to compare the two
lists today,—he might, if he would,
reveal secrets that even the Bawl
out does not expose. For ourselves
we know that many a good man
and true, who stood with us in
early days, has dropped by the
way. Mut we claim them still—
Cieissler and Gage will always be
Naughty-Two's, whether they have
twenty-three hours, or one hun
dred and twenty-three hours.
The four years of our college life
is ended, the last lecture is over,
the last ex has been taken. Our
days as undergraduates are num
bered. The years we have spent
here have been wonderful ones.
We saw the ground broken for the
Library and the Assembly Hall, we
saw the massive arch builded stone
by stone, and we have watched the
Memorial Church as it grew from
its very foundations to a completed
whole. And in after years, when
the magnificent outer quadrangle
encloses the inner, we shall remem
ber all these things,and remember
ing feel ourselves both a part of the
new and a part of the old Univer
sity —a part of the old when we
think that in our first days there
was 110 arch, no church, no outer
quadrangle,—just the quad, with its
memories and associations coming
down from Pioneer days; and a part
of the new, when we realize that it
was during our college life that new
deeds were wrought, new plans con
ceived, and a Greater University
begun.
Following tilt! reading of the His
tory, President Taylor of the Soph
omore Class gave a short addresss
in delivering the cane, which has
always been an insignaof the Soph
omore Class, to 1905 in the abstract
as the president of the coming
Sophomore Class was not present,
llalph A. Hamilton read the witty
Class Will, written by Lioger J. Ster
rett,and bequeathing many interest -
ing things to the successor of 1902.
The audience then adjourned to the
the ledication of the '02 Plate be
fore the Church.
LAYING THE PLATE.
Herbert C. Jones Delivered the Ora
tion.—Response by Dr. Jor
dan. —The Song 1 .
The laying of the Class Plate,
under which was placed the parch
ment roll bearing the signatures of
the graduates, took place in front
of the Memorial Church. The
Class orator, Herbert C. Jones, in
opening his speech said that
this occasion brought the class
together for the last time but
one. He then traced briefly the
events that had transpired during
the four years of the Class in col
lege, and the part it had taken in
these affairs. During this time
the members of the Class had made
the most of their privileges, had
been forming lasting companion
ships, and had come to love and
honor their professors. In part
Jones continued:
Jones' Speech.
"And now we have completed
our course. Today we stand at the
goal, and just before we depart we
meet here within the shadow of
this Memorial Church, on this spot
hallowed by the custom of seven
preceding classes, to dedicate this
plate bearing the numerals. We
leave this plate here, not in the
spirit of boastfulness, but simply
as a tablet laid in the enduring
pavement to remind others of the
part we played. May it serve to re
mind you, President Jordan, of our
regard for you, of our sincere grati
tude for your friendly relations
with us in the years now closing.
"May it serve to tell others of
our affection for our professors, of
our gratitude to the founders who
have so wisely and generously
placed the means of education
within the reach of all, and of our
loyalty to Stanford. But not only
should it be a token to others, but
it should be a symbol to each mem
ber of the class as well. To strang
ers who shall pass by here after we
are all gone, it will mark us but as
one of many. But to us it has a
deeper meaning. To us it repre
sents all that the Class stands for.
It represents the embodiment of
our aspirations for the future, and
of those feelings of love and friend
ship that have bound us together
in the past.
"Now that we are about to separ
ate we begin to realize the true
depth of college friendship. As the
end approaches we are drawn to
gether as never before. Somehow
everything in college life tends to
make classmates love one another.
Being together day by day, as the
weeks and months and years went
by, we have found manliness and
sincerity and earnestness where
the world might have found only
sham. We have strolled along a
pleasant way, having time despite
our work to enjoy the fresh air,
green fields, and sunshine, to
wander by the lake, or through the
oaks, to roam among the hills, to
loiter a little for jest and banter
and song.
"We have been wandering in this
careless, happy way so long that we
had almost forgotten the forking of
the road. Today we have reached
a dell where the road stops. The
scenery appears strange, and there
is no way out but by little narrow
paths that wind over the hills and
up the valleys, some bright, some
dark, but all lovely so far as we
can see. And each must push his
way by himself on this journey
during the years to come. But
though we clasp hands and part, we
keep the power of the golden days.
And though in the future we be
scattered down the four wide ways,
we will still let our minds revert to
our present experiences. We will
think of this day, and this plate,
and remember that it stood for the
best that is in us. It will serve to
awaken recollections of the dear old
quad nestled among the foothills,
and symbolizing, as it does, our

steadfast loyalty to one another, it
will revive the memory of those col
lege friendships which we value
above all else.
"Classmates —some of you I may
never see —may your future be filled
with sweetness from the past. And
since to be truly loved is more than
all the brilliancy of empty honors,
may the years to come be rich in
the treasures of affection and friend
ship as these have been. From the
bottom of my heart I wish you all
Godspeed."
President Jordan's Remarks.
At the close of Jones' address
President Jordan stepped forward
and, in part, replied:
"It is both difficult and pleasant
for me to talk at this time. It is
difficult because it is hard for any
one who has talked a great deal to
throw his real feelings into a few
words in a speech, such as should
be made at the dedication of a class
plate. On the other hand it is
pleasant because of what the class
plate represents, what it stands for
in University annals. It means
that two hundred young people
have come to the end of their col
lege days. This plate will be put
alongside of these other plates, —
seven of them, —and then another
of them will be laid, and another,
and another, and as they go on
down the centuries and around the
quadrangle there will be erected
therein a monument to strength
and goodness and beauty.
"This plate represents Stanford
men and women. It is not entirely
true, as Mr. Jones has said, that
the members of the class have come
to the separating from Stanford
ways and people, for wherever
Stanford men go there they make
a new Stanford. We, who move
about over the earth, find Stanford
men everywhere; we meet Stanford
men in the streets, in the clubs, in
the schools, in the workshops
of the world. The world is not big
enough to lose the Stanford man
nor to hide the Stanford spirit.
The whole country is being dyed
with the cardinal hue, with Stan
ford life, the emanation of the
Stanford spirit.
"Mrs. Stanford, in her travels,
finds everywhere the Stanford
spirit, and is greeted on every hand
by the Stanford love for Stanford
people."
Miss Webster's Song.
After President Jordan's address
the '02 Plate Song, by Hazel Hope
Webster, was given by the assem
blage to the tune of "America."
The song is as follows:
Oh, flying years, to ye
Come we with earnest plea,
Protect this plate!
Till the old world is hoar
And stones shall stand no more,
Preserve it, we implore,
Inviolate.
Be ye its gracious guard
That it may live unscarred
Our name to bear!
Whate'er our fate may bring
Here will our inem'ries cling;
Oh! let not anything
Remove your care.
The committee in charge of the
Plate dedication consisted of Miss
Webster, C. D. Scott, A.(i. Page,
L. L. Loofbourow, W. B. Barber,
and Percy McDowell, chairman.
