The Class Day exercises were he
gun in the chapel at half-past ten
Saturday morning. A large crowd
was in attendance, and many peo
ple had to stand. Frank liin
nian, president of the graduating
class, gave an address of welcome
to everybody for the exercises of
the week, and of farewell to the col
lege on behalf of the class. Me
dwelt upon the fact that the pre
vailing feeling of the week would
be one of freedom and enjoyment.
"Undergraduatesseldom appreciate
their good times," he said, "until
the end of their college life. The
Seniors, innocent of the future, and
not comprehending the immediate
change in their lives, realize only
that the one great object for which
they have been striving for four
years —or it may he more —is at
last achieved. The prevailing idea
is one of freedom, it is with this
thought in mind that the Seniors
have so endeavored to plan the pro
gram for the week.
"It is not possible for us to ignore
altogether the fact that this week is
the last of our college life. During
these few days that are left we must
hid a lingering farewell to all the
old familiar places about which so
many pleasant memories linger.
The quadrangle and its lecture
rooms and laboratories, Lagunita,
the foothills, Frenchman's Lake,
the cactus garden, Adelante Villa,
Cooley's Landing, and the big Ar
boretum, will live as mere mind
pictures.
"We must also say good-bye to
professors and instructors, and to
our closest friends and associates.
Our impressions of Stanford Univer
sity as we will leave it have been
given us by these people, and it is
with regret that we leave them.
But we have every confidence in
the future of our Alma Mater, and
we are glad to know that the men
to whom this future is entrusted
are worthy of that confidence."
Miss Mary E. McDougald, class
historian, read the history, which
dealt with the annals of 1902 from
the day that its members came to
Stanford as freshmen up to the
present. It was as follows:
The Class History.
Our college life began that Sep
tember day in '98 when 359 in awe
alike of the authorities and the
upper-classmen trembling, filled out
our matriculation cards, and filed
out from the Registrar's presence
—the Freshman class of Naughty-
Two. There were no daring ad
venturous spirits among us —we
had no wild idea of painting our
numerals as a temptation to
doughty Sophomores — no such
audacious thought as class rushing
penetrated our minds; we were con
tent to enter quietly, unobtru
sively, becoming a part of Stanford
undergraduate life with as little
fuss and ceremony as possible, and
behaving as good children should,
being seen and not heard. Per
haps if it had been otherwise, if
in our midst there had been some
courageous youths who would have
infused into us a spirit of daring,

or fired us with the zeal of daring
things, there is really no telling
what we might have accomplished.
If we hadn't allowed ourselves to
be tied by the Sophomores, if we
had won our Freshman cane, if —
this history might have been a
record of deeds of prowess as yet
unheard. But '98 was the year of
the terrible slump, and as dutiful
Freshmen we went down before it.
It was not all gloom that year,
however. There was one bright
spot —the tennis was ours, and the
victor, Hardy, a Naughty-Two.
Our Sophomore year began as
inauspiciously as did our Fresh
man. The lusty Naughty-Three's
arrived with a swing and swirr,
but the Naughty-Two's were happy,
going quietly on in their own sweet
way, not caring particularly for
class contests and class victories,
but offering their youth and mus
cle for the Varsity. Rice was our
only man who made the team in
his freshman days, but when the
next year Stanford went up against
Berkeley in that never-to-be-for
gotten game, four Naught-Two
men were there, fighting and strug
gling till the last scrimmage. It
was the same story in the field-day,
— again Naughty-Two girt 011 their
armor, and won points for the Var
sity. Even now class champion
ship troubled us but little; we were
happy if the brawn and muscle of
our men went to the glory and honor
of the college. Suppose we have
the reputation of winning the largest
string of booby prizes ever drawn
in college! There has been but one
terrible slump at Stanford, but it
happened when we were being
initiated into college ways and
college customs, and who knows
but what we have suffered from
the reflection of those dark days.
But our Junior year opened
brightly. The heavy shadows that
had clouded our days as under
classmen were gone. Stanford had
recovered her spirits, hope was in
the air, Jack Reynold's new battle
cry, "On to 1900," was bearing
fruit, and again Naught-Two men
bore their part in the strife and
shared in the glories of victory.
With the dignity that befits upper
classmen we planned our Junior
year. We had come into man's
estate, we must do great things.
Wise in our day and generation
we bethought ourselves that the
mystic rites and solemn dedication
of our awful plug-ugly was our
chance to provide for our future.
The thought boldly conceived was
as boldly executed, and almost one
hundred dollars added to our bank
account. But Copp's reputation as
a class treasurer did not end here.
When, after one of the most success
ful Junior days ever held (and
others besides ourselves will agree
to this) the Class accounts were
published, and our riches revealed'.
The college public stood silent in
admiration. Over five hundred
dollars —a record breaker fora
Junior class. And lastly came the
annual, the Quad. So ended our
three years.
What of our last year at college?

We gave our men, as of yore, to
lead the Varsity in football and
baseball, and to bear its brunt in
the Held. For the first time in our
career Naught-Two men won their
little gold S, and fought for Stan
ford as gallantly and bravely as
have the athletes before them.
Think not, though, that our hon
ors have been won solely on the
field and in forensics. We have
borne our part of trials and tribu
lations as college editors; we have
had a goodly number of wondrous
politicians of various hues and de
signs; we have had singers and
actors galore, with a playright or
two thrown in. What more could
a class desire in the way of college
honors?
Now we stand on the eve of grad
uation, one hundred and seventy
of us, where four years ago there
were almost four hundred. The
all-seeing eye of the Registrar's as
sistant might detect strange hidden
truths were he to compare the two
lists today,—he might, if he would,
reveal secrets that even the Bawl
out does not expose. For ourselves
we know that many a good man
and true, who stood with us in
early days, has dropped by the
way. Mut we claim them still—
Cieissler and Gage will always be
Naughty-Two's, whether they have
twenty-three hours, or one hun
dred and twenty-three hours.
The four years of our college life
is ended, the last lecture is over,
the last ex has been taken. Our
days as undergraduates are num
bered. The years we have spent
here have been wonderful ones.
We saw the ground broken for the
Library and the Assembly Hall, we
saw the massive arch builded stone
by stone, and we have watched the
Memorial Church as it grew from
its very foundations to a completed
whole. And in after years, when
the magnificent outer quadrangle
encloses the inner, we shall remem
ber all these things,and remember
ing feel ourselves both a part of the
new and a part of the old Univer
sity —a part of the old when we
think that in our first days there
was 110 arch, no church, no outer
quadrangle,—just the quad, with its
memories and associations coming
down from Pioneer days; and a part
of the new, when we realize that it
was during our college life that new
deeds were wrought, new plans con
ceived, and a Greater University
begun.
Following tilt! reading of the His
tory, President Taylor of the Soph
omore Class gave a short addresss
in delivering the cane, which has
always been an insignaof the Soph
omore Class, to 1905 in the abstract
as the president of the coming
Sophomore Class was not present,
llalph A. Hamilton read the witty
Class Will, written by Lioger J. Ster
rett,and bequeathing many interest -
ing things to the successor of 1902.
The audience then adjourned to the
the ledication of the '02 Plate be
fore the Church.
LAYING THE PLATE.

The laying of the Class Plate,
under which was placed the parch

the graduates, took place in front
of the Memorial Church. The
Class orator, Herbert C. Jones, in
opening his speech said that
this occasion brought the class
