of Commencement week, for those
who were fortunate enough to take
advantage of it, was the Senior
Smoker given in Duff and Doyles'
hall, Menlo Park, Friday evening,
the 23d. The attendance was much
less than had been anticipated, but
the enthusiasm of the small crowd
present, and the delightful success
of the entertainment, made the in
auguration of the custom of
holding the smoker each year
a promising one. A generous
supper was served in the fore part
of the evening. After an informal
singing of some Stanford songs,
Professor C. It. Lewers, '96, toast

classes that have gone out into the
world from the University, and
those that are about to graduate.

vancement evidenced by the classes
of today over those of the earlier his
tory. He expressed intense pleas
ure at returning, and said that, in
his extensive travel since gradua
tion, lie has met Stanford men
everywhere, all of whom are a
credit to their Alma Mater, show
ing the spirit of honor and integ
rity.
