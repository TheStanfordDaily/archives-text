# PROMENADE CONCERT
## Music of Band, Handsome Illumination, and Attractive Booths. 
### 
With music of band, beautiful
illumination, handsomely arranged
booths, the Senior Promenade Con
cert took place last evening in the
inner quadrangle. Probably no
graduating class in the past has
achieved so great a success in this
particular feature of Senior week.
Besides myriads of Chinese lanterns,
the east and west arches were sur
mounted with cardinal electric
lights,forming designs of the figures
'02. From the front of the Memo
rial Church hung one of these de
signs, fifteen feet in height, and
lighted with white incandescent
globes. The three small arches op
posite the Church returned an illum
ination from a multitude of white
lights. The large band-stand erec
ted in the center of the quad was
artistically decorated.
The booths where the sororities
and other organizations entertained
their friends were strikingly cosy
and artistic. Yanke's military brass
band of forty-one pieces gave a pro
gram of twelve numbers.
