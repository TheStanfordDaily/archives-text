# "A PARALLEL AND A LESSON."
## Strong Address Given by Professor A.T. Murray at the Commencement Exercises This Morning.—Lessons of Hellenism For the Present Age. 
### 
In one of his most vivid and dra
matic scenes Plato represents an
Athenian youth, who, having heard
that a noted teacher is in town, comes
to Socrates' house before it is really
daylight, begging that he will take
him to hear the great man. The boy
is ready to spend all his own means
and to borrow of his friends —for the
sophist's fees were high —but at any
cost he craves this boon to sit at the
feet of a man famous throughout the
Greek world to learn of him.
We are not primarily concerned
with the art of Plato's portrayal of the
eager enthusiasm of the boy, the
playful irony of Socrates, or even
with the interest their discussion has
for us, touching as it does upon the
fundamental principles of all educa
tion ; but rather with the intellectual
atmosphere that is suggested. To be
eager to learn, to be alive to the
quickening influences about one ; to
be a lover of truth and an untiring
searcher for truth, these are charac
teristics no man may despise ; and
they are the traits most conspicuous
in the Greek, traits seen again and
again in Plato's young men.
We are sometimes inclined to lay
stress on those phases of human life
and human experience which tend to
produce in one the belief that there
is really nothing new under the sun;
but oftener, I think, to regard the
present age as one that stands alone
in human history. And in many re
spects our age is unique. Its achieve
ment almost appalls us and its prom
ise of future achievement is all but
limitless. New light comes daily, as
it were, to illumine dark questions:
new forces, or new applications of al
ready recognized forces, are brought
to bear upon material problems, until
some are all but ready to claim that
there is no really insoluble enigma,
that Nature has no secret which man
may not master, no force that may
not be made subservient to human
needs. History can assuredly offer
110 real parallel to this. Yet back of
the achievement of any period lies the
same human nature, essentially alike
in all ages, and the spirit that has
made our age what it is has not man
ifested itself now for the first time.
Two periods, in particular, suggest
themselves. One is, of course, that
of the Renascence, when men broke
free from the trammels of the Middle
Age and sought to win truth for them
selves and not by tradition of their
fathers; when, as their spiritual hor
izon widened, new and stimulating
elements of culture were seen to sur
round them on every hand; when
adventurous mariners sailed over un
known seas and brought back tales
of new worlds. There is likeness
here, despite the unlikeness. And
there is likeness too in an earlier age,
the age which Plato, in part, inter
prets, as it is the age which made
Plato possible. It too was an age of
renascence, when the Greek world,
after nerving itself fora great strug -
gle and thrusting back the barbarian

invaders who threatened to crush it,
found itself indeed born again, and
entered upon a new life, facing new
problems, conscious of new powers,
stimulated by new ideals. Then his
tory began to reshape itself, and, in a
decade 01* two, a new age had been
ushered in, the like of which the
world had never seen, the like of
which, in some respects, the world
may never see.
Our debt to the Greeks in the
matter of art and literature is gen
erally recognized, even though
the recognition is not always an
intelligent one. They were indeed a
gifted people, with whom the artistic
sense possessed a sureness that
amounted almost to instinct; and in
Art and in Literature they are eter
nally our masters. But the essential
genius of the Greeks is seen in other
fields as well, and we shall be helped
by considering it.
The Greeks, then, typify the spirit
of reason and of sanity; and this they
brought to bear 011 everything with
which they came into contact. We
see it in their religion, in their art, in
their philosophy, their politics, their
quest for knowledge. They, and
they first in human history, dared to
bring the untrammeled reason and
intellect of man to bear upon the
problems of nature and of human life.
They dared to seek to lift the veil
which hides Nature's secrets and to
fathom them for themselves, demand
ing, as it were, of the inscrutable
powers which rule the universe that
a rational explanation be afforded to
searching humanity. When first we
meet them, in the two great epics
with which the literature of Europe
begins, they bring with them a new
and a saner spirit. They are free
from the dark and brooding super
stitions of older peoples, under the
burden of which men had lived lives
warped and hampered by the terror
of malignant demons or the stereo
typed prescriptions of a priestly class,
and have created for themselves a
new heaven, as they were to create a
new earth a heaven peopled with
resplendent beings wearing the noble
form of man and with natures not far
removed from the nature of man.
Small wonder that this same inform
ing, humanizing spirit shaped their
artistic conceptions, and that in art
the form of man found, with them
first, adequate expression.
We too often think of the Greeks
as a people of bright, sunshiny tem
perament, rejoicing in the beauty of
the outward world and free from any
oppressive sense of life's mystery.
True, their attitude is eminently
healthful; true, they tend rather to
emphasize the bright and joyous as
pect of life ; but it would be a serious
error to assume that this buoyancy of
spirit came from any lack of percep
tion of the gloomier side. Man lives
his life on grim conditions, and the
ineffable sadness of much that sur
rounds human lot, the futility of
mail's hopes, the inevitable end of

all living—these things confronted
the Greek as they confront us, and
they were clearly seen and frankly
faced. The Greek vision was clear
and the Greek intellect was honest.
They never shut their eyes to the
truth, their very nature impelled them
to seek to see things as they are, to
accept them frankly, and to live their
lives in the light of them. So there
is a note of melancholy, of pessimism,
if you will, which sounds in minor
chords from Homer down to the late
Alexandrians; but it is never world
weariness, never a melancholy that
tends to paralyze the energy of
body or of mind. From this their
sane spirit saved them, and enabled
them, in the face of life's mystery
and life's sadness, to maintain an even
serenity of temper and a calm and
tonic philosophy.
But to have peopled Olympus with
radiant, humanized gods was not
enough. Nature's enigmas are ever
present, and the questionings of the
enfranchised human intellect are per
sistent. If the Greeks created gods
in their own image, they no less sanely
came to see that the legends of myth
ology afford 110 explanation of the
material universe, of things as they
are. To this enigma of enigmas they
applied themselves, nor could any
thing daunt them. For they were
lovers of truth of truth for its own
sake; and they were unresting in their
search for truth. Baffled they might
be, faulty in its method their search
might be; but persistent and unremit
ting it ever was. Now be it said that
to this restless, inquiring Greek spirit
we owe the beginnings of all science.
They were the pioneers; we, who
have come after, have pushed 011 be
yond the furthest limits they could
have imagined; we have rectified
their errors; we have revolutionized
their methods; but the spirit of in
quiry, the desire to know, the restless
search —these things are a part of
their heritage to us. It is easy for
us to overlook this, so prone are we
to regard only the discoveries of our
own day and to magnify them, for
getting that there was once a time
when the investigator not only had
no collected data upon which to base
deductions, but when the very laws
of thought had not been formulated.
It is easy too for us to underrate the
value of the scientific achievements of
an earlier age, easy to take it for
granted that they must have been
relatively unimportant. In the face of
this, even at the risk of being tiresome,
one is tempted to recall the elabora
tion of the science of pure mathematics
at the hands of Euclid, Archimedes,
and Apollonius, the researches of
the Greek astronomers- researches
pushed so far that a recent writer has
ventured to express the belief that,
but for the destruction of Greek na
tionality, the work of Copernicus, of
Kepler, and of Newton might have
been anticipated a thousand years be
fore, —the work of the Greeks in the
physical and engineering sciences,
in natural history and in medicine.
These are matters that concern the
specialist primarily, their force is to
be felt in its fullness only by those
whose studies have led them to tra
verse these fields for themselves; but
the Greek spirit was the same where
ever it manifested itself. They, and
they first, approached the problem of
government and not only evolved

democracy, but made the theory of
the state a matter of philosophic study.
They considered the relations of man
to man and developed the science of
Ethics, putting it too upon a firm
philosophic basis; they turned their
attention to the laws of thought and
of formulated speech, with the result
that Logic—the mother of the
sciences—was born and scientific
demonstration made possible.
The history of 1 lerodotus is a potent
testimony to this Greek desire for
knowledge. The very word history
—unlike the res gestae of the Ro
mans —suggests, not a chronicle of
events, but an inquiry, a search, a
getting at truth. Now, to us, with
the equipment at our disposal, this
means the use of great libraries with
their wealth of original documents,
the delving into old archives, elab
orate topographical studies, the sift
ing of evidence, the desire to get facts
at first hand and not as tradition has
distorted them. But how was it in
Herodotus' day, when there were no
libraries, 110 documents, other than
here and there a treaty, graven on
stone, and, amid temple records, lists
of priests and genealogies of noble
families, the latter making no claim
to credibility? He could at least seek
to know; and in a day when travel,
apart from its expense, was a matter
of serious danger, journeyed not only
throughout Greece proper and South
ern Italy, but as far as upper Egypt,
as far as Susa and Babylon, and to
the wild regions lying north of the
Black Sea, seeking to learn for him
self what he could of the strange
customs of distant lands, that he
might weave this into his narrative of
the great struggle between East and
West, between Orientalism and Hel
lenism. Faulty the sources of his
information were, for he was at the
mercy of dragomans in lands where
he lacked knowledge of the language;
incomplete was only too often his
understanding of fact, and his theory
of divine government made it easy
for him to see the working of higher,
external powers where we look for
an explanation based upon the facts
themselves and grounded in what we
know of human nature. But is His
tory —modern, scientific History —
to spring into life fully developed, as
Athena from the head of Zeus ?
When all allowances have been made
for defective knowledge, for credul
ity, for preconceived notions of the
workings of Providence, we have
still honesty, a desire to hear both
sides, witholding judgment where
the evidence seemed to him insuffi
cient, a love of truth, and a genuine
thirst for knowledge. Such was the
spirit of the "Father of History";
and we have but to turn from him to
his great successor to see that the
spirit of scientific criticism has indeed
awakened, that the old credulity is
gone. The ideals Thucydides sets
before him would do honor to the
historian of today, and his great His
tory, showing as it does his keen in
sight into the causes of political move
ments and his profound reading of
human nature, can never lose its
value.
These characteristics of the genius
of the Greek — sanity, serenity,
honesty of intellect, love of truth,
and a thirst for knowledge —
show themselves most clearly in
the period I mentioned at the
outset. Present they were both be
fore it and after it, pointing the
way to a better understanding of
man's nature and of man's surround
ings, and leading men to see clearly,
to think fearlessly, to bear with equa
nimity; but the fifth century before
Christ is unique, as was the fifteenth,
let us say, of our era, and as was the
nineteenth.
When the fifth century dawned
Greece had served its apprenticeship;
its formative period was past; it was
ripe for achievement. Then came
the great struggle of freedom against
despotism, a struggle to determine
the destinies of -Europe. We may
say that Herodotus' account is not
to be trusted in all its details; we may
assume gross exaggeration; but the
importance of the struggle and the
magnitude of the issues at stake can
not be overestimated. The elements
of our civilization, of our science, of
our political and social institutions,
and all that the Greeks had accom
plished, all the promise of future ac
complishment in the fields of the arts
and of letters were there to survive
or to be swept away, leaving human
ity to begin afresh centuries later.
Well for the world that the strong
arms of free men triumphed and de
termined for ;ill time what the influ
ences were to be which should mould
Europe.
Let us now see how the world of
Greek life and thought was affected
by this struggle.
One feature of national crises
is that life becomes intense; the petty
and the commonplace sink below the
surface; strong natures and high
principles come to the front. At
once throughout Greece there was a
quickening, a revivifying of those
forces that had made Greek thought
and Greek action rich in the past.
The aesthetic, the intellectual, the
spiritual sides of men's natures
craved, and found, a more satisfying
expression. A wave of deepened
religious feeling swept over Greece,
reconciling, for the time being, the
reason of the individual with the
traditions of the past. Was it not
indeed easy to believe that the very
gods themselves had saved Hellas?
So the period immediately following
upon the wars was not an age of spirit
ual unrest, of torturing doubts. It
was an age of action and of accom
plishment, intense and yet free from
extravagance and affectation, refined
and yet strong. A new Athens
springs Phoenix-like from the ashes
of the old, and to this new Athens
comes the new thought to find there
its home, to make the city —beautiful
as none other —the center whence
civilizing influences were to radiate
over Greece and over the world.
It is this Athens that we see in
Plato. For, while his writings all
date from the fourth century, the
scenes of his dialogues are laid in the
fifth, when his great master lived and
worked; and it is in relation to Soc
rates that we are to study Plato's
pictures of Athenian youth. Now
recall again the scene already men
tioned--a scene so characteristic of
the period. We can now better un
derstand the boy's enthusiasm and
his immediate resolve to hear the
great Protagoras; and, did time per
mit us to dwell upon the scene, we
should see also his honest admissions
called forth by Socrates' questions,
and the genial kindliness of the latter,
showing itself even through the irony
we come to know so well.
This great Protagoras was one of
the famous wise men of his day, one
of a large class of professional teach
ers who went from city to city
throughout Greece lecturing —olt-

times for large fees,—attracting wide
notice by their elaborate eloquence
and skilful argumentation, profess
ing themselves able to instruct and
train the youth, and, in many cases,
imparting instruction in some partic
ular branch of science.
History offers few more fascinating
problems than that which the stu
dent of the fifth century faces in en
deavoring rightly to appreciate the
position and the work of these men.
In a very true sense they were a
product of their age. They bear
witness to the widespread craving
for knowledge, and they did much to
stimulate it. To them is due real
and important progress in more than
one line of research, and they spread
abroad much sound instruction. Yet
they brought with them the danger
ous art of words—eloquence where
with to dazzle their hearers, clever
ness in argument, which in a period
antedating the study of formal logic,
was fraught with boundless possibili
ties of mischief. They were ready,
if we may believe Plato, to prove any
thing more eager to convince their
hearers of the apparent inevitability
of their conclusions than themselves
to test the soundness of their prem
ises—and their knowledge was only
too often but superficial. Added to
this, in the popular mind at least,
was a belief that these men were un
dermining the faith of the people,
teaching doctrines irreconcilable with
a belief in the gods. For the period
of deeper religious feeling which per
vaded Greece immediately after the
wars with Persia, and of which the
poet Aeschylus is perhaps the best
exponent, was not a long one. Rea
son and tradition, reconciled for the
time, were soon alienated aga : n,
and, in an age of such tremendous
intellectual activity, the foundations
of belief were sure to be callled into
question, while the results of scienti
fic investigation ran counter to ac
cepted views. More than this: These
men were prominent as speculative
thinkers; and Greek speculative
thought, before Socrates, had virtu
ally reached the conclusion that real
truth was unattainable —even as Pro
tagoras himself taught that man was
the measure of all things.
How much an age, such as this
has in common with our own! It
followed hard upon a national crisis
triumphantly met; it was an age of
wonderful alertness and energy,
shown in the development of a deeper
and fuller national life, with larger
aims and larger ambitions, so that
before the generation which had
fought at Marathon and Salamis had
passed away, Athens had become
the mistress of a great empire whose
might was feared alike on sea and
on land; shown too in an intellectual
and spiritual awakening, which broad
ened men's conceptions, enlarged
their mental horizon, roused the
forces slumbering in their midst, and
stimulated all their powers to a new
and larger activity. All this we have
ourselves seen, for these things make
up to a great extent the atmosphere
in which we live. We too feel the
air, as it were, surcharged with
energy; we too know the craving
for new things, the restless search for
truth, the joy of discovery. We too
know what it is to be called upon to
deal with world-problems fraught
with immeasurable significance for all
time. We too have seen the founda
tions of men's faith slipping away,
have heard men preaching that there
is no truth, that it is idle to talk of
truth. Again is heard the voice of
those who declare that man is the
measure, that there is no standard for
the individual other than his own

judgment, his own senses. And we,
like the Athenians of old, have our
sophistic movement to face, full of
danger for us, as theirs for them. In
our land too are teachers of large
following, men of brilliancy and of
eloquence, who care more for self
aggrandizement than for truth, and
who stoop to the tricks of the sophist
to achieve their ends, preaching un
der the sacred name of science that
which is at best but pseudo-science,
and lacking too often the first great
requisite of the investigator and the
teacher —intellectual honesty. And
we too have here and there our Soc
rateses, lifting up their voices in pro
test. In the dangers also which
beset Athens as a state—dangers to
which she, in the end, succumbed
the student of history may well see a
warning to us. She, a democracy,
grew to be the head of a great em
pire; she sought to bring under her
sway lands far beyond the seas, and
squandered blood and treasure in the
attempt, blindly, recklessly claiming
that might made right. She saw the
bitter fruits of civic strife, when her
sons put party loyalty above patriot
ism; saw too how the love of gain
could warp men from the paths of
right.
And what shall we say? That
our democratic ideals are safe, when
the opening of a new century finds
us waging a war of conquest? When
the truth is stilled by men in author
ity, and when those who might help
to right matters are more loyal to
party than to conscience? Can we
clear ourselves if one says of us that
our material prosperity makes us
slow to feel the power of the things
of the spirit ?
There is the lesson —the things of
the spirit. The great age uf Greece
was not only an age of intellectual
awakening and of material progress; it
was great also in these. This rest
less search for truth, fora reasonable
explanation of things, went hand in
hand with a love of the beautiful, with
a refusal to put up with the common
place. Throughout all the fields in
which men could exert their activities
the leaven of art was at work, and
men wrought not for the moment but
for all time. Hence the Parthenon
grew up in its severe and chaste love
liness, hence the delicate grace of the
Erechtheum, hence too Phidian sculp
ture, as wonderful for its technique
as for its intellectuality; and the
potter's ware for daily use must needs
be of exquisite outline. In literature
too it was an age of creation, and its
creations were masterpieces. The
drama springs into life to sound the
depths of human joy and sorrow, and
that with an art which, after more
than two milleniums, can still sway
our hearts and minds. Herodotus,
as the first historical investigator,
turns to tell the tale of the Persian
wars, and becomes the creator of
artistic prose; the speculations of
those whose genius led them to pon
der the problems of philosophy, of
metaphysics, of ethics, found in Plato
a master whose poetic soul expressed
itself in a style of unequaled charm,
while in oratory the forces were al
ready at work which were to culmi
nate in the impassioned eloquence of
I )emosthenes.
But why dwell on this ? The lesson
is patent. Are we too great in these
things ? Is our art, our architecture,
our poetry, or our prose, such that
coming generations, coming centuries
or even milleniums, will look to us
with wonder and seek to work as we
have wrought?
Wrong indeed would he be who
would substitute for the highest ideals
of today those of any earlier age. The
long experience and the numberless
failures of humanity have counted for
little, unless men have learned to live
richer, fuller lives than the Greeks
even dreamt of. But in our age of
gross materialism how we need their
spirit!
Young men and women of the
graduating class, I have failed indeed
if I have not led you to realize at
once our debt to Greece and the les
sons that Hellenism has for this age
of ours. These lessons concern us
all. If it is your duty to show your
selves good citizens, it is the function
of your Alma Mater to aid in the
training of good citizens. And as
you leave us to take up your work
in larger fields, we bid you carry with
you these Greek virtues. As true
men and women you will be lovers oi
the true, and an unflinching, un
swerving honesty of intellect will
come first. This will lead you to see
things as they are, unblinded by
prejudice or tradition. You will deal
with facts, not with fancies. But with
this honest clearness of vision seek to
combine the Greek sense of measure,
of proportion. This is indispensable
to every one who would take up the
calling of the investigator. He must
be judge and not advocate ; he must
see largely, see in proper perspective.
And this same sense of measure will
aid you, as it aided the Greek, when
you confront life's problems and meet
life's crises. It will enable you, 1
trust, to maintain something of their
serenity of temper ; it will save you
from falling into pessimism.
Alert you will be, you must be —
quick to respond to the influences of
culture that lie round about you.
And, while a disinterested love of
truth is the foundation-stone of all
culture, the Greeks have taught us
what it is to be lovers of the true and
of the beautiful as well. Hold to
this. Let the love of the beautiful in
nature, in art, and in literature per
meate your lives with its elevating,
sweetening influence ; let your artistic
sense be trained by noble models,
that you may be as quick to discern
between the true and the false here
as in the field of science. And to
this end cherish the love of good
books. He who has this dwells in
the society of the great souls of earth,
and communes with them as with
familiar friends, however mean and
sordid may be the conditions that
surround him. Of this friendship
neither isolation nor adversity can
rob you.
These are among the lessons taught
us by the Greeks of old -taught us
by Plato and his fellows. We have
a newer and a larger gospel to which
we turn, but their voice should not
go unheeded. Others than Plato
have taught men to live sanely and
to die bravely; but who among those
who have dealt with philosophic
thought have been artists such as
he? Who of those who have faced
the deep problems of life have done it
with so sunshiny a spirit? To our
turbulent, feverish modern life his
message comes indeed as a breeze
from goodly regions, fraught with
health'.
