# "A PARALLEL AND A LESSON."
## Strong Address Given by Professor A.T. Murray at the Commencement Exercises This Morning.—Lessons of Hellenism For the Present Age. 
### 
In one of his most vivid and dra
matic scenes Plato represents an
Athenian youth, who, having heard
that a noted teacher is in town, comes
to Socrates' house before it is really
daylight, begging that he will take
him to hear the great man. The boy
is ready to spend all his own means
and to borrow of his friends —for the
sophist's fees were high —but at any
cost he craves this boon to sit at the
feet of a man famous throughout the
Greek world to learn of him.
We are not primarily concerned
with the art of Plato's portrayal of the
eager enthusiasm of the boy, the
playful irony of Socrates, or even
with the interest their discussion has
for us, touching as it does upon the
fundamental principles of all educa
tion ; but rather with the intellectual
atmosphere that is suggested. To be
eager to learn, to be alive to the
quickening influences about one ; to
be a lover of truth and an untiring
searcher for truth, these are charac
teristics no man may despise ; and
they are the traits most conspicuous
in the Greek, traits seen again and
again in Plato's young men.
We are sometimes inclined to lay
stress on those phases of human life
and human experience which tend to
produce in one the belief that there
is really nothing new under the sun;
but oftener, I think, to regard the
present age as one that stands alone
in human history. And in many re
spects our age is unique. Its achieve
ment almost appalls us and its prom
ise of future achievement is all but
limitless. New light comes daily, as
it were, to illumine dark questions:
new forces, or new applications of al
ready recognized forces, are brought
to bear upon material problems, until
some are all but ready to claim that
there is no really insoluble enigma,
that Nature has no secret which man
may not master, no force that may
not be made subservient to human
needs. History can assuredly offer
110 real parallel to this. Yet back of
the achievement of any period lies the
same human nature, essentially alike
in all ages, and the spirit that has
made our age what it is has not man
ifested itself now for the first time.
Two periods, in particular, suggest
themselves. One is, of course, that
of the Renascence, when men broke
free from the trammels of the Middle
Age and sought to win truth for them
selves and not by tradition of their
fathers; when, as their spiritual hor
izon widened, new and stimulating
elements of culture were seen to sur
round them on every hand; when
adventurous mariners sailed over un
known seas and brought back tales
of new worlds. There is likeness
here, despite the unlikeness. And
there is likeness too in an earlier age,
the age which Plato, in part, inter
prets, as it is the age which made
Plato possible. It too was an age of
renascence, when the Greek world,
after nerving itself fora great strug -
gle and thrusting back the barbarian

invaders who threatened to crush it,
found itself indeed born again, and
entered upon a new life, facing new
problems, conscious of new powers,
stimulated by new ideals. Then his
tory began to reshape itself, and, in a
decade 01* two, a new age had been
ushered in, the like of which the
world had never seen, the like of
which, in some respects, the world
may never see.
Our debt to the Greeks in the
matter of art and literature is gen
erally recognized, even though
the recognition is not always an
intelligent one. They were indeed a
gifted people, with whom the artistic
sense possessed a sureness that
amounted almost to instinct; and in
Art and in Literature they are eter
nally our masters. But the essential
genius of the Greeks is seen in other
fields as well, and we shall be helped
by considering it.
The Greeks, then, typify the spirit
of reason and of sanity; and this they
brought to bear 011 everything with
which they came into contact. We
see it in their religion, in their art, in
their philosophy, their politics, their
quest for knowledge. They, and
they first in human history, dared to
bring the untrammeled reason and
intellect of man to bear upon the
problems of nature and of human life.
They dared to seek to lift the veil
which hides Nature's secrets and to
fathom them for themselves, demand
ing, as it were, of the inscrutable
powers which rule the universe that
a rational explanation be afforded to
searching humanity. When first we
meet them, in the two great epics
with which the literature of Europe
begins, they bring with them a new
and a saner spirit. They are free
from the dark and brooding super
stitions of older peoples, under the
burden of which men had lived lives
warped and hampered by the terror
of malignant demons or the stereo
typed prescriptions of a priestly class,
and have created for themselves a
new heaven, as they were to create a
new earth a heaven peopled with
resplendent beings wearing the noble
form of man and with natures not far
removed from the nature of man.
Small wonder that this same inform
ing, humanizing spirit shaped their
artistic conceptions, and that in art
the form of man found, with them
first, adequate expression.
We too often think of the Greeks
as a people of bright, sunshiny tem
perament, rejoicing in the beauty of
the outward world and free from any
oppressive sense of life's mystery.
True, their attitude is eminently
healthful; true, they tend rather to
emphasize the bright and joyous as
pect of life ; but it would be a serious
error to assume that this buoyancy of
spirit came from any lack of percep
tion of the gloomier side. Man lives
his life on grim conditions, and the
ineffable sadness of much that sur
rounds human lot, the futility of
mail's hopes, the inevitable end of

all living—these things confronted
the Greek as they confront us, and
they were clearly seen and frankly
faced. The Greek vision was clear
and the Greek intellect was honest.
They never shut their eyes to the
truth, their very nature impelled them
to seek to see things as they are, to
accept them frankly, and to live their
lives in the light of them. So there
is a note of melancholy, of pessimism,
if you will, which sounds in minor
chords from Homer down to the late
Alexandrians; but it is never world
weariness, never a melancholy that
tends to paralyze the energy of
body or of mind. From this their
sane spirit saved them, and enabled
them, in the face of life's mystery
and life's sadness, to maintain an even
serenity of temper and a calm and
tonic philosophy.
But to have peopled Olympus with
radiant, humanized gods was not
enough. Nature's enigmas are ever
present, and the questionings of the
enfranchised human intellect are per
sistent. If the Greeks created gods
in their own image, they no less sanely
came to see that the legends of myth
ology afford 110 explanation of the
material universe, of things as they
are. To this enigma of enigmas they
applied themselves, nor could any
thing daunt them. For they were
lovers of truth of truth for its own
sake; and they were unresting in their
search for truth. Baffled they might
be, faulty in its method their search
might be; but persistent and unremit
ting it ever was. Now be it said that
to this restless, inquiring Greek spirit
we owe the beginnings of all science.
They were the pioneers; we, who
have come after, have pushed 011 be
yond the furthest limits they could
have imagined; we have rectified
their errors; we have revolutionized
their methods; but the spirit of in
quiry, the desire to know, the restless
search —these things are a part of
their heritage to us. It is easy for
us to overlook this, so prone are we
to regard only the discoveries of our
own day and to magnify them, for
getting that there was once a time
when the investigator not only had
no collected data upon which to base
deductions, but when the very laws
of thought had not been formulated.
It is easy too for us to underrate the
value of the scientific achievements of
an earlier age, easy to take it for
granted that they must have been
relatively unimportant. In the face of
this, even at the risk of being tiresome,
one is tempted to recall the elabora
tion of the science of pure mathematics
at the hands of Euclid, Archimedes,
and Apollonius, the researches of
the Greek astronomers- researches
pushed so far that a recent writer has
ventured to express the belief that,
but for the destruction of Greek na
tionality, the work of Copernicus, of
Kepler, and of Newton might have
been anticipated a thousand years be
fore, —the work of the Greeks in the
physical and engineering sciences,
in natural history and in medicine.
These are matters that concern the
specialist primarily, their force is to
be felt in its fullness only by those
whose studies have led them to tra
verse these fields for themselves; but
the Greek spirit was the same where
ever it manifested itself. They, and
they first, approached the problem of
government and not only evolved

democracy, but made the theory of
the state a matter of philosophic study.
They considered the relations of man
to man and developed the science of
Ethics, putting it too upon a firm
philosophic basis; they turned their
attention to the laws of thought and
of formulated speech, with the result
that Logic—the mother of the
sciences—was born and scientific
demonstration made possible.
The history of 1 lerodotus is a potent
testimony to this Greek desire for
knowledge. The very word history
—unlike the res gestae of the Ro
mans —suggests, not a chronicle of
events, but an inquiry, a search, a
getting at truth. Now, to us, with
the equipment at our disposal, this
means the use of great libraries with
their wealth of original documents,
the delving into old archives, elab
orate topographical studies, the sift
ing of evidence, the desire to get facts
at first hand and not as tradition has
distorted them. But how was it in
Herodotus' day, when there were no
libraries, 110 documents, other than
here and there a treaty, graven on
stone, and, amid temple records, lists
of priests and genealogies of noble
families, the latter making no claim
to credibility? He could at least seek
to know; and in a day when travel,
apart from its expense, was a matter
of serious danger, journeyed not only
throughout Greece proper and South
ern Italy, but as far as upper Egypt,
as far as Susa and Babylon, and to
the wild regions lying north of the
Black Sea, seeking to learn for him
self what he could of the strange
customs of distant lands, that he
might weave this into his narrative of
the great struggle between East and
West, between Orientalism and Hel
lenism. Faulty the sources of his
information were, for he was at the
mercy of dragomans in lands where
he lacked knowledge of the language;
incomplete was only too often his
understanding of fact, and his theory
of divine government made it easy
for him to see the working of higher,
external powers where we look for
an explanation based upon the facts
themselves and grounded in what we
know of human nature. But is His
tory —modern, scientific History —
to spring into life fully developed, as
Athena from the head of Zeus ?
When all allowances have been made
for defective knowledge, for credul
ity, for preconceived notions of the
workings of Providence, we have
still honesty, a desire to hear both
sides, witholding judgment where
the evidence seemed to him insuffi
cient, a love of truth, and a genuine
thirst for knowledge. Such was the
spirit of the "Father of History";
and we have but to turn from him to
his great successor to see that the
spirit of scientific criticism has indeed
awakened, that the old credulity is
gone. The ideals Thucydides sets
before him would do honor to the
historian of today, and his great His
tory, showing as it does his keen in
sight into the causes of political move
ments and his profound reading of
human nature, can never lose its
value.
These characteristics of the genius
of the Greek — sanity, serenity,
honesty of intellect, love of truth,
and a thirst for knowledge —
show themselves most clearly in
the period I mentioned at the
