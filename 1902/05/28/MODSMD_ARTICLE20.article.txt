# FACULTY WINS.
## Beat the Seniors with an Enormous Score.—Graduates Lacked Fantastic Costumes. 
### 
The Faculty won the baseball
game from the Seniors Monday
morning with the enormous score
of 25 to 13. This is the fourth con
secutive victory of the professors
over the graduating classes since
1898. The interest in the annual
contest was greatly reduced by the
failure of the Seniors to appear in
fantastic costumes. This feature
has hitherto been the main attrac
tion of the Commencement week
struggle. The costumes ordered,
which were similar to those used in
the Antigone, did not arrive from
the city in time.
As an exhibition of baseball the
game on Monday was a dismal fail
ure. The Seniors particularly seem
to have been chosen for their posi
tions because of personal beauty
rather than ability to play the
national game. The members of
the Faculty piled up a fearful ava
lanche of runs and hits. Two- and
three-baggers were frequent. The
game promised to he of some inter
est during the Hist three innings,
but in the fourth McDowell was
knocked out of the box, and the
Faculty piled up thirteen runs.
The game was devoid of any par
ticular feature. Dr. Jordan held
down first for his men, and won re
peated applause by his nimble
movements. He also had the dis
tinction of bringing in the firHt run
for the professors by a timely sac
rifice bit to short-stop, allowing
Professor Murray to cross the home
plate. The latter made a spectacu
lar catch of a long Hy to left in the
seventh inning. A good crowd of
students and visitors saw the game.
