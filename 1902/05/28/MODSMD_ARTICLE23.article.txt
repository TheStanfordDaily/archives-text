# THE 						SENIOR FARCE
## Sterrett's Production, "The Rank Outsider," the First Event of Commencement. 
### 
The Senior Farce for the Class of
1902, entitled "The Rank Outsider,"
written by Roger J. Sterrett, '02,
and staged under the direction of
Mrs. W. H. Irwin,'9B, was creditably
given in Assembly Hall Thursday
evening, May 22d. It marked the
close of college work for the year
and opened the Commencement week
festivities. The choruses were good
and showed careful training, al
though laboring under the disad
vantage of insufficient rehearsals.
The effect of the calcium lights in
the "Florodora stunt," in the sec
ond act, gave one of the most beau
tiful scenes ever presented in a
Stanford farce. It received repeated
encores. The plot was not obvious
ly strong, but the work of the prin
cipals and choruses, together with
the music, contributed to make it a
pleasing and entertaining farce. It
was based entirely on Stanford stu
dent life.
The action centered around the
election for president of the student
body; the scrapes of Bert l'inkerley,
the Kappa Rho freshman; and the
adventures at college of the Rank
Outsider, Colonel Robert S. Gibbs,
of the Dead Coyote Crude Petrol
eum, and "one of the boys."
The quadrangle scene was life
like, and the deal in "dirty poli
tics" of Dick Stoddard, the Encina
candidate, was typical of student
body politics; while the sympa
thetic scene between Pinkerley, the
wounded hero, and Kathryn La
velle, the Senior queen, was given
with jest and enjoyment. In the
scene of the second act, the lawn
fete of the Kappa Rhos, the
dancing, the singing, the costumes,
and the lights gave an irresistable
charm. The Knockers chorus was
weird and dramatic, giving a touch
of tragedy to the scene, coming in
contrast with the lawn fete just be
fore.
Act 111, Scene 1, was a true rep
resentation of the regular meeting
of the "Knockers' Club," while the
innovations of telephone and
ticker were decidedly novel; they
would no doubt somewhat compli
cate student body elections. The
last scene, Stoddard's room, the
night of an Encina "at home," re
vealed some startling facts con
cerning the boy's dormitory which,
however, are pronounced on good
authority as exaggerated.
On the whole, each one of the
cast carried his part well. The
fact that it was a play based on
Stanford life at present made it es
pecially difficult. The facility
with which the scenes were handled,
causing no uncomfortable delay be
tween acts, was commendable.
Waldemar Young, '04, as Col
onel Robert S. Gibbs, revealed re
markable ballet dancing powers.
His facial expression was as good
as ever, and his wrist got in some
excellent work. In acting and in
costume effect he made a decided
hit. Leo Byrne, '05, as the Kappa
Rho freshman, always mixed up in
something where he did not be
long, filled his role cleverly. His
expression, carriage, and general
manner where typical of the fel
low who is a "mark" but does not
know it. J. K. Bonnell, O'J, "Graf
ton Grab, reporter for the Excoria
tor, the Greatest One-cent, Heaven
sent Daily On or Off the Earth,"
proved himself an able correspon

dent, and was funny during every
minute he was on the stage. As
the blanket-man, when he spoke of
Benjamin Ide Wheeler as "the in
ventor of the Greek language," and
gave lines from the Antigone with
an Irish accent and expression, he
brought down the house. K. A.
Richardson, '04, "Dick Stoddard's
room-mate," wa√ü good, and F. H.
Fowler, '04, as "Arethusa Boggs,"
proved to be a most humorous and
successful female impersonator.
"Bud Stoddard, football man from
Encina, Knocker candidate for
student body President," played
by E. V. Kehrlein, was the college
man of the athletic hero style, who
thinks the University belongs to
him, and who does not mind taking
it. The Kappa Rhos: H. Barkan,
'04, C. L. Firebaugh, '04, A. Per
rin, '03, and R. E. Warfield, '03,
were well suited to their parts;
while J. F. English, '01, and Roger
Sterrett, as Knockers, were quite
at home on the stage.
The characters of the girls were
less strongly drawn than those of
the men, but were equally well
taken. Miss Porter, '05, as the
Senior Queen, represented the col
lege girl fully able to take her own
part. On account of the sudden
i 11 ness of Miss Sue Bird, Mrs. Irwin
took her lines as the "Roble Inge
nue,"and was remarkably successful
in the role which she had assumed
on such short notice. The parts of
the students, knockers, co-eds,
queens, queeners, marks, freaks
were taken in a realistic and enter
taining manner, and helped to
make up a strong cast.
The work of the orchestra, under
the leadership of A. J. Copp,Jr., '02,
was especially praiseworthy, while
the costumes and scenery were ex
cellent. A fairly large house wit
nessed the play.
