# DR. JORDAN ON UNIVERSITY-BUILDING.
## Addresses Graduates on Characteristics of Coming Institution in America.— College Aims to Make Wise, Sane, Well-Rounded Men. 
### 
The roll of the Alumni of our Uni
versity now numbers more than 1600
names. Men and women of Stan
ford, they are scattered far and wide
over the whole earth, and in their
various ways each one is doing honor
to the training in effectiveness and
character given them by their Alma
Mater. The roll is a roll of honor,
and to this list today as youth of
promise, young men and young
women of the Republic, the Leland
Stanford Junior University is glad
and proud to add your names as well,
confident that in the days to come
your Alma Mater shall be glad and
proud to say, " These too are my
children."
With the end of our Republic's first
century we had the first clear vision
of the greatest of republican institu
tions the American university. It
was even then only a vision. It is not
yet realized, but we know something
of what it is to be. Out of the strug
gles and the prayers, the hopes and the
efforts of good men and good women,
wesee it taking form. A university as
fair as those which England has
known fora thousand years, as sound
and as strong as the deep-rooted
schools of Germany, with something
of both, yet different from either, is
the coining University of America.
There will be many of these institu
tions, for our land is very wide, and
they will differ from each other some
what in kind, and as one star differ
eth from another in glory, still of the
same general pattern all must be. They
will be schools for training American
boys and girls to be American men and
women. They will express the loftiest
ideals of higher education within our
great democracy. One of this great
sisterhood of universities our own
Stanford must become, hence it is fit
ting for us, from time to time, to con
sider the present, and to forecast the
future.
The American college, as it existed
thirty years ago and more, and as it
still exists in some quarters, is dis
tinctly a school for personal culture.
Its strongest agency has been the
personal influence of devoted men. It
has made no effort to give profes
sional training. It has made no pre
tense of leading in scientific research.
A log with Mark Hopkins at one end
of it and himself at the other was
Garfield's conception of such a col
lege. Even the log is not essential.
The earnest teacher is all in all. Ap
paratus Mark Hopkins did not need,
books he even despised. The medium
of a forgotten language and an out
worn philosophy served him as well
as anything else in impressing on his
boys the stamp of his own character.
It was said of Dr. Nott of Union Col
lege that "He took the sweepings of
other colleges and sent them back to
society pure gold." Such was his
personal influence on young men.
A notable example of the college
spirit was Arnold of Rugby. Another
was Jowett, Master of Baliol. A
teacher of this type, in greater or less
degree, it was the privilege of every
college student to know, and this
knowledge still reconciles him to his
alma mater, however many her
shortcomings in subject or method.
Hut times have changed since the
days of Mark Hopkins. The Ameri
can college —Knglish born and Eng

lish in tradition—under the touch of
German influences, and in response
to actual needs, is changing to the
American university. It is no longer
a school of culture alone, a school of
personal growth through personal ex
ample. It is becoming, in addition
to this, a school of research, a school
of power. It stands in the advance
guard of civilization, responsive not
to the truth of tradition alone but to
the new truth daily and hourly re
vealed in the experience of man.
In the movement of events the
American university unites in itself
three different functions: that of the
college, that of the professional school,
and that which is distinctive of the
university.
The college is now, as ever, a school
of culture. It aims to make wise,
sane, well-rounded men who know
something of the best that men have
thought and done in this world, and
whose lives will be the better for this
knowledge. It has not discarded the
Latin, Greek, and Mathematics which
were so long the chief agents in cul
ture, but it has greatly added to this
list. It has found that to some minds,
at least, better results arise from the
study of other things. Culture is born
from mastery. The mind is strength
ened by what it can assimilate. It
can use only that which relates itself
to life. We find that Greek-minded
ness is necessary to receive from the
Greek all that this noblest of lan
guages is competent to give. We
find for the average man better educa
tional substance in English than in
Latin, in the Physical or Natural
Sciences than in the Calculus. Hut
more important than this, we find
that it is safe in the main to trust the
choice of studies to the student him
self. The very fact of choice is in
itself an education. It is better to
choose wrong, sometimes, as we do
a hundred times in life, than to be
arbitrarily directed to the best selec
tion. Moreover, so far as culture is
concerned, the best teacher is more
important than the best study. It is
still true, as Emerson once wrote to
his daughter, that "It matters little
what your studies are; it all lies in
who your teacher is." A large insti
tution has many students. It has
likewise many teachers, and an Ar
nold or a Hopkins, a Warner or a
Thoburn, can come just as close to
the students' hearts in a large school
as in a small one. But "the know
ing of men by name," the care for
their personal lives and characters,
must be the essential element in the
new college course as it was in the
old. And the college function of the
university must not be despised or
belittled. Because Germany has no
colleges, because her students go di
rectly from the high school at home
to the professional school or the uni
versity, some have urged the aban
donment by the American university
of this primal function of general cul
ture. In their eagerness to develop
the advanced work some institutions
have relegated the college function
almost solely to tutors without exper
ience, and have left it without stand
ards and without serious purpose. It
is not right that even the Freshmen
should be poorly taught. On the
soundness of the college training
everything else must depend. In the
