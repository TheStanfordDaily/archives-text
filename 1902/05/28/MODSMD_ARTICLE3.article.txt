# DR. JORDAN ON UNIVERSITY-BUILDING.
## Addresses Graduates on Characteristics of Coming Institution in America.— College Aims to Make Wise, Sane, Well-Rounded Men. 
### 
The roll of the Alumni of our Uni
versity now numbers more than 1600
names. Men and women of Stan
ford, they are scattered far and wide
over the whole earth, and in their
various ways each one is doing honor
to the training in effectiveness and
character given them by their Alma
Mater. The roll is a roll of honor,
and to this list today as youth of
promise, young men and young
women of the Republic, the Leland
Stanford Junior University is glad
and proud to add your names as well,
confident that in the days to come
your Alma Mater shall be glad and
proud to say, " These too are my
children."
With the end of our Republic's first
century we had the first clear vision
of the greatest of republican institu
tions the American university. It
was even then only a vision. It is not
yet realized, but we know something
of what it is to be. Out of the strug
gles and the prayers, the hopes and the
efforts of good men and good women,
wesee it taking form. A university as
fair as those which England has
known fora thousand years, as sound
and as strong as the deep-rooted
schools of Germany, with something
of both, yet different from either, is
the coining University of America.
There will be many of these institu
tions, for our land is very wide, and
they will differ from each other some
what in kind, and as one star differ
eth from another in glory, still of the
same general pattern all must be. They
will be schools for training American
boys and girls to be American men and
women. They will express the loftiest
ideals of higher education within our
great democracy. One of this great
sisterhood of universities our own
Stanford must become, hence it is fit
ting for us, from time to time, to con
sider the present, and to forecast the
future.
The American college, as it existed
thirty years ago and more, and as it
still exists in some quarters, is dis
tinctly a school for personal culture.
Its strongest agency has been the
personal influence of devoted men. It
has made no effort to give profes
sional training. It has made no pre
tense of leading in scientific research.
A log with Mark Hopkins at one end
of it and himself at the other was
Garfield's conception of such a col
lege. Even the log is not essential.
The earnest teacher is all in all. Ap
paratus Mark Hopkins did not need,
books he even despised. The medium
of a forgotten language and an out
worn philosophy served him as well
as anything else in impressing on his
boys the stamp of his own character.
It was said of Dr. Nott of Union Col
lege that "He took the sweepings of
other colleges and sent them back to
society pure gold." Such was his
personal influence on young men.
A notable example of the college
spirit was Arnold of Rugby. Another
was Jowett, Master of Baliol. A
teacher of this type, in greater or less
degree, it was the privilege of every
college student to know, and this
knowledge still reconciles him to his
alma mater, however many her
shortcomings in subject or method.
Hut times have changed since the
days of Mark Hopkins. The Ameri
can college —Knglish born and Eng

lish in tradition—under the touch of
German influences, and in response
to actual needs, is changing to the
American university. It is no longer
a school of culture alone, a school of
personal growth through personal ex
ample. It is becoming, in addition
to this, a school of research, a school
of power. It stands in the advance
guard of civilization, responsive not
to the truth of tradition alone but to
the new truth daily and hourly re
vealed in the experience of man.
In the movement of events the
American university unites in itself
three different functions: that of the
college, that of the professional school,
and that which is distinctive of the
university.
The college is now, as ever, a school
of culture. It aims to make wise,
sane, well-rounded men who know
something of the best that men have
thought and done in this world, and
whose lives will be the better for this
knowledge. It has not discarded the
Latin, Greek, and Mathematics which
were so long the chief agents in cul
ture, but it has greatly added to this
list. It has found that to some minds,
at least, better results arise from the
study of other things. Culture is born
from mastery. The mind is strength
ened by what it can assimilate. It
can use only that which relates itself
to life. We find that Greek-minded
ness is necessary to receive from the
Greek all that this noblest of lan
guages is competent to give. We
find for the average man better educa
tional substance in English than in
Latin, in the Physical or Natural
Sciences than in the Calculus. Hut
more important than this, we find
that it is safe in the main to trust the
choice of studies to the student him
self. The very fact of choice is in
itself an education. It is better to
choose wrong, sometimes, as we do
a hundred times in life, than to be
arbitrarily directed to the best selec
tion. Moreover, so far as culture is
concerned, the best teacher is more
important than the best study. It is
still true, as Emerson once wrote to
his daughter, that "It matters little
what your studies are; it all lies in
who your teacher is." A large insti
tution has many students. It has
likewise many teachers, and an Ar
nold or a Hopkins, a Warner or a
Thoburn, can come just as close to
the students' hearts in a large school
as in a small one. But "the know
ing of men by name," the care for
their personal lives and characters,
must be the essential element in the
new college course as it was in the
old. And the college function of the
university must not be despised or
belittled. Because Germany has no
colleges, because her students go di
rectly from the high school at home
to the professional school or the uni
versity, some have urged the aban
donment by the American university
of this primal function of general cul
ture. In their eagerness to develop
the advanced work some institutions
have relegated the college function
almost solely to tutors without exper
ience, and have left it without stand
ards and without serious purpose. It
is not right that even the Freshmen
should be poorly taught. On the
soundness of the college training
everything else must depend. In the
long run the greatest university will
be the one that devotes the most care
to its undergraduates. With the col
lege graduation higher education in
England mostly stops. With Ger
many here the higher education he
gins. Higher education has been de
fined as that training which demands
that a man should leave home. It
means a breaking of the leading
strings. It means the entrance to
another atmosphere. The high school
and the gymnasium cannot have the
academic atmosphere, however ad
vanced their studies may be. They
must reflect the spirit of the town
which supports them, and of which
they are necessarily a part. They
cannot be free in the sense in which
the universities are free. A boy who
lives at home in a city, and goes back
and forth on a train, cannot be a uni
versity student. He may recite in
the university classes, but there his
relation ends. He gets little of the
spirit which moves outside of the class
room. He cannot enter the univer
sity until he breathes the university
atmosphere. The "Spurstudenten,"
or "railway students," those who
come and go on the trains, are right
ly held by their fellows in Germany
to be little more than Philistines.
Whatever the other excellencies of
the German system, the gymnasium,
or advanced high school, is an inade
quate substitute for the American col
lege.
The second function of the univer
sity is that of professional training.
To the man once in the path of cul
ture this school adds effectiveness in
his chosen calling. This work the
American universities have taken up
slowly and grudgingly. The demand
for instruction in law and medicine
has been met weakly but extensively
by private enterprise. The schools
thus founded have been dependent
on the students' fees, and on the ad
vertising gain their teachers receive
through connection with them. Such
schools as these stand no comparison
with the professional schools of Ger
many. Their foundation is precari
ous, they cannot demand high stand
ards, nor look beyond present neces
sities to the future of professional
training. Only a few of our profes
sional schools today demand univer
sity standards. Those who do not
cannot share the university spirit.
They have no part in university
development. Only in the degree
that they are part and parcel of
the university do they in general
deserve to live. The first pro
fession to become thus allied is
that of engineering, thanks to the
wisdom that directed the Morrill Act.
Following this, law, medicine, theol
ogy, education, have in some quar
ters, taken a university basis, and the
few professional schools in which such
a basis exists rank fairly with the best
of their class in the world.
Thecrowningfunction ofa university
is that of original research. On this
rests the advance of civilization. From
the application of scientific knowledge
most of the successes of the Nine
teenth Century have arisen. It is the
first era of science. Behind the ap
plication of such knowledge rests the
acquisition of it. One Helmholtz, the
investigator, is the parent of a thou
sand Edisons, the adapters of the
knowledge gained by others. The
great function of the German
university is that of instruction
through investigation. The stu
dent begins his work on a narrow
space at the outer rim of knowledge.
It is his duty to carry the solid
ground a little farther, to drive back
ever so little it may be the darkness
of ignorance and mystery. The real

university is a school of research.
That we possess the university spirit
is our only excuse that we adopt the
university name. A true university
is not a collection of colleges. It is
not a college with an outer fringe of
professional schools. It is not a clus
ter of professional schools. It is the
association of scholars. It is the insti
tution from which in every direction
blazes the light of original research.
Its choicest product is "that fanati
cism for veracity," as Huxley calls
it, that love for truth, without which
man is but the toy of the elements.
Its spirit is the desire "to know
things as they really are," which is
the necessary attribute of "him that
overcometh." No institution can be
college, professional school, and uni
versity all in one, and exercise all
these functions fully in the four years
which form the traditional college
course. To attempt it is to fail in
one way or another. We do at
tempt it and we do fail. In the engi
neering courses of today we try to
combine in four years professional
training with research and culture.
This cannot be done, for while the
professional work is reasonably com
plete, culture is at a minimum, and
research crowded to the wall. The
subject of law requires three solid
years for professional training alone.
Three or four culture years go with this,
and are surely none too many. The
same requirement must soon be made
in Engineering. We cannot make an
engineer in four years if we do any
thing else for him, and there are very
many things besides engineering
which go to the making of a real
engineer.
Hut this we can do in the four years
of college culture: We can show the
student the line of his professional
advancement, and can see him well
started in its direction before he has
taken his first degree. We can give
in the college course something of
the methods and results of advanced
research. In any subject the ad
vanced work has a higher culture
value than elementary work. Thor
ough study of one subject is more
helpful than superficial knowledge of
half a dozen. To know one thing
well is, in Agassiz's words, "to have
the backbone of culture." By limit
ing the range of individual training to
a few things done thoroughly it is
possible to give even to the under
graduate some touch of real univer
sity method, some knowledge of how
truth is won. To accomplish this is
one vital part of the university's duty.
It welds together the three functions
of a university, and in so doing it will
give the American university its most
characteristic feature.
The best education for any man
with brains and character should in
volve these three elements:
It should have the final goal in
view as soon as possible.
It should be broad enough and
thorough enough to develop cultured
manhood, and at the same time to
furnish the strength needed to reach
this goal. In other words, it should
look to success in the profession and
to success as a man. Toward both
these ends the methods of finding the
truth for one's self are vitally essential.
The university should disclose the
secret of power, and this secret lies in
thoroughness. Science is human
experience tested and set in order.
The advance of science has come
through the use of instruments of
precision and methods of precision.
Opinion, feeling, tradition, plausibil
ity, illusions of whatever sort, disap
pear when the method of power is
once mastered.
The college course should have a

little of the professional spirit for its
guidance, a little of the university
spirit for its inspiration; the best in
terests of all three will keep them in
the closest relation to each other. At
the same they must not starve each
other. At the present time the needs
of the college in most cases tend to
dwarf the more costly functions of the
university. The professors have their
hands full of lower work. The books
and material the university work de
mand are far more costly than the
college can afford. The trustees still
too often regard the graduate school
as an expensive alien, and its de
mands in most quarters still receive
scant attention. To train fifty inves
tigators costs more than to give a
thousand men a college education.
The sciences cost more than the hu
manities, and the applied sciences,
with their vast and changing array of
machinery, are most expensive of all.
Equally unwise, it seems to me,
though less common, is the disposi
tion to slight the college course for
the sake of advanced research. Poor
work, wherever done, leaves its mark
of poverty. The great university of
the future will be the one which does
well whatever it undertakes, be it
high or low. Better have few de
partments, very few, than that any
should be weak and paltry. Better
few students well taught than many
neglected.
It is fair to judge a university by
the character of its advanced work.
Institutions cannot be graded by the
number in attendance. This is the
most frequent and most vulgar gauge
of relative standing. The rank of an
institution is determined no more by
the number of its students than by
the number of trees on its campus.
W r hat sort of men does it have, and
what are they doing ? These are the
living questions. Buildings are conven
ient; beautiful buildings have a great
culture value. We should be the last
to under-rate the effect of the charm
of cloisters and towers, of circles of
palms and sweet-toned bells. But
these do not make a university.
Books are useful, they are vital to re
search, but wiser men than we have
ever known have grown up without
books. Shakspere had few of them,
Lincoln but few, Homer and Jesus
none at all. Books serve no purpose
if they are not used. The man who
reads it gives the book its life.
Specimens are inevitable in natural
history. Apparatus is necessary in
physical science. Collections and
equipment are really the outgrowth
of the men that use them. You can
not order them in advance. Pro
fessor Haeckel once said, bitterly,
that the results of research in the
great laboratories was in inverse
proportion to the perfection of their
appliances. An investigation may be
lost in multiplicity of details, or in
elaboration of preparation. Some
men will spend years in getting a
microscope or a microtome just right
and then never use it. It is said
that the entire outfit of Joseph Leidy,
one of the greatest of our microsco
pists, cost just seventy-five dollars.
It was the man and not the equip
ment that made his investigations
luminous.
Publication is necessary, but it
would be the greatest of mistakes to
measure a university by the number
of pages printed by its members.
Much of the so-called research, even
in Germany, is unworthy of the name
of science. Its subject matter is not
extension of human experience, but
the addition to human pedantry. To
count the twists and turns of literary
eccentricity may have no more intel
lectual significance than to count the
dead leaves in the forest. Statistical
work is justified not by the labor it
requires, but by the laws it unveils.
Elaboration of method may conceal
the dearth of purpose. Moreover, it
is easier to string the web of plausi
bility than to recover the lost clue ol
truth. Of a thousand doctors' theses
each year, scarcely one in a hun
dred contains a real addition to
knowledge. When it does it
may be that the hand of the
master placed it there. In too many
cases a piece of research is simply a
bid for notice. American universi
ties are always 011 the watch for men
who can do something as it should
be done. Work is often done solely
to arrest the attention of the univer
sity authorities. A professorship once
gained, nothing more is heard of re
search. The love of novelty with the
itch for writing often passes for the
power of original research. The fan
aticism for veracity has nothing in
common with versatile writing or
paradoxical cleverness. It took Dar
win twenty-five years of the severest
work before he could get his own
leave to print his own conclusions.
Other writers put forth sweeping gen
eralizations as rapidly as their type
writers can take them from dictation.
In certain works which have arrested
popular attention, the investigations
must have gone on at the highest
speed attainable by the pen of the
gifted author. Such work justifies
Fechner's sarcastic phrase, "Cuckoo's
eggs laid in the nest of science."
The work of science is addressed
to science, no matter if half a dozen
generations pass before another inves
tigator takes up the thread. The
science of the newspapers is of quite
another type, and so is much of the
science of just now famous men from
whom newspaper science derives its
inspiration.
While the university on its human
side is interested in all that touches
the life of today, on the scientific side
it deals with the eternal verities, and
cares nothing for those things which
are merely local or timely.
The University must conduct re
search to ends of power. This it has
hardly begun to do in America. Half
our graduate students are not ready
for anything to be called investiga
tion. They are not real students of
a real university. The graduate de
partments of our universities are now
engaged almost exclusively in train
ing teachers. That profession may
be the noblest—where noble men
make it so, but it is only one of many
in which success must rest on orig
inal investigation. We are proud of
our crop of Doctors of Philosophy,
dozens or hundreds turned out
every year. But most of them
are trained only toteach, and we
know that half of them are pre
destined to failure as college teach
ers. We must broaden our work
and widen our sympathies. We must
train men in the higher effectiveness
in every walk in life, men of business
as well as college instructors, states
men as well as linguists, and ship
builders as well as mathematicians,
men of action as well as men of
thought. This means a great deal
more than annual crops of Doctors of
Philosophy to scramble for the few
dozen vacant instructorships open
year by year. But with all these dis
couragements original research is the
loftiest function of the university.
In its consummate excellence is found
the motive for its imitation.
There is but one way in which a
university can discharge this function.
It cannot give prizes for research. It
cannot stimulate it by means of pub

lication, still less by hiring men to
come to its walls to pursue it. The
whole system of fellowships for ad
vanced students is on trial, with most
of the evidence against it. The students
paid to study are not the ones who do
the work. When they are such, they
would have done the work unpaid.
The fellowship system tends to turn
science into almsgiving, to make the
promising youth feel that the world
owes him a living.
All these plans of university build
and others, have been fairly
tried in America. There is but
one that succeeds. Those who
do original work will train oth
ers to do it. Where the teachers are
themselves original investigators de
voted to truth and skilful in the
search for it—men that cannot be
frightened, fatigued, or discouraged
—they will have students like them
selves. To work under such men
students like-minded will come from
the ends of the earth. It is the part of
the investigators to make the univer
sity,as the teachers makes the college.
There never was a genuine univer
sity on any other terms. It is not
conceivable that there should ever be
one. It is not necessary that all de
partments should be equal to make
the university real. It was enough
at Harvard to have Agassiz and Gray,
Lowell, Goodwin, and Holmes, to
justify the name of university. Silli
man and Dana made a university of
Yale. Such men are as rare as they
are choice, and no university faculty
was ever yet composed of them alone,
and none ever yet had too many of
them. President Gilman has wisely
said:
" In the conduct of a university se
cure the ablest men as professors,
regardless of all other qualifications,
excepting those of personal merit and
adaptation to the chairs that are to
be filled. Borrow if you cannot en
list. Give them freedom. Give them
auxiliaries. Give them liberal sup
port. Encourage them to come be
fore the world of science and of let
ters with their publications. Bright
students, soon to be men of distinc
tion, will be their loyal followers, and
the world will say Amen.
'' The merit of a university depends
on the men who are called to conduct
it, upon them absolutely if not exclu
sively; for although the teacher must
have such auxiliaries as books and in
struments —books are nothing but
paper and ink until they are read,
and instruments but brass and glass
until craft and skill are applied to
their handling."
But it is in its men that the real
university has its real being. Through
the work of such men it stands in the
vanguard of civilization. By such
men it counts the milestones in its
course, and no trick of organization,
no urging of the printing-press, no
subsidy of students, can be made to
take their place.
A final word as to the practical side
of advanced research. Mr. Carnegie
once ascribed the foundation of his
great fortune to the fact that lie first
employed trained chemists where
other manufacturers chose workmen
skilled in making steel by rule of
thumb. His chemists were able to
suggest improvements. They de
vised ways of making better steel
cheaper still, and at the same time of
utilizing the refuse or slag
In the future the success of each
great enterprise must depend on the
improvements it makes. The nation
successful in manufacture and com
merce will be the one richest in labor
aiding devices. All these must de
' pend on the advancement of knowl

edge. Pure science must precede
applied science.
Once the manufacturer or the na
tion could hire its chemists as it needed
them. The few asked for were al
ready made. Now they must make
them. The advancement of any
branch of science depends 011 the
mastery of what is known before.
Everything easy and everything in
expensive has been found out. To
train the chemist of the future we
need constantly finer instruments of
precision for his advanced work, ac
cess to greater and greater libraries
that he may know what is already
done, for each generation of scientific
workers must stand on the shoulders
of those gone before, else it can make
110 progress beyond them. The
scholars of today would be helpless
were it not that they can save time
by drawing freely on the accumulated
knowledge of the past.
To learn the elements of any science
costs little. It can be learned at one
end of a log with a great teacher on
the other. It can be even learned
without a teacher. But to master a
science so as to extend its boundaries
—this is quite another thing. More
than a man can earn in a lifetime it
costs to make a start. For this rea
son a university which provides means
for such work is a very costly estab
lishment. For this reason the inves
tigator of the future must depend on
the university. The nation with
the best equipped universities will
furnished the best-trained men. On
the universities the progress in man
ufactures and commerce must depend.
Through the superiority of training
Germany is passing England in the
commercial world in spite of her
handicaps of position and history.
Through the excellence of her uni
versities, without most of these hand
icaps, America is likely to excel both
Germany and England.
As men of science are needed,they
cannot make themselves. Those with
power can help them. This fact has
given the impulse to the far-reaching
gifts of Stanford, Rockefeller, Carne
gie, and Rhodes. These are not gifts
but investments put to the credit of
the country's future. The people,
too, have power to give. The
same feeling of investment has
led them to build their state
universities, and to entrust to
them not only the work of per
sonal culture, but of advancement in
literature, science, and arts. With
general culture and professional train
ing must go the advancement of
knowledge, the progress of society,
through the advancement of the wis
dom and the power of man.
The roll of the Alumni of our Uni
versity now numbers more than 1600
names. Men and women of Stan
ford, they are scattered far and wide
over the whole earth, and in their
various ways each one is doing honor
to the training in effectiveness and
character given them by their Alma
Mater. The roll is a roll of honor,
and to this list today as youth of

women of the Republic, the Leland
Stanford Junior University is glad
and proud to add your names as well,
confident that in the days to come
your Alma Mater shall be glad and

likewise many teachers, and an Ar

Thoburn, can come just as close to
the students' hearts in a large school
as in a small one. But "the know
ing of men by name," the care for
their personal lives and characters,
must be the essential element in the
new college course as it was in the
old. And the college function of the
university must not be despised or
belittled. Because Germany has no
colleges, because her students go di
rectly from the high school at home
to the professional school or the uni
versity, some have urged the aban
donment by the American university
of this primal function of general cul
ture. In their eagerness to develop
the advanced work some institutions
have relegated the college function
almost solely to tutors without exper
ience, and have left it without stand
ards and without serious purpose. It
is not right that even the Freshmen
should be poorly taught. On the
soundness of the college training
everything else must depend. In the
long run the greatest university will
be the one that devotes the most care
to its undergraduates. With the col
lege graduation higher education in
England mostly stops. With Ger
many here the higher education he
gins. Higher education has been de
fined as that training which demands
that a man should leave home. It
means a breaking of the leading
strings. It means the entrance to
another atmosphere. The high school
and the gymnasium cannot have the
academic atmosphere, however ad
vanced their studies may be. They
must reflect the spirit of the town
which supports them, and of which
they are necessarily a part. They
cannot be free in the sense in which
the universities are free. A boy who
lives at home in a city, and goes back
and forth on a train, cannot be a uni
versity student. He may recite in
the university classes, but there his
relation ends. He gets little of the
spirit which moves outside of the class
room. He cannot enter the univer
sity until he breathes the university
atmosphere. The "Spurstudenten,"
or "railway students," those who
come and go on the trains, are right
ly held by their fellows in Germany
to be little more than Philistines.
Whatever the other excellencies of
the German system, the gymnasium,
or advanced high school, is an inade
quate substitute for the American col
lege.
The second function of the univer
sity is that of professional training.
To the man once in the path of cul
ture this school adds effectiveness in
his chosen calling. This work the
American universities have taken up
slowly and grudgingly. The demand
for instruction in law and medicine
has been met weakly but extensively
by private enterprise. The schools
thus founded have been dependent
on the students' fees, and on the ad
vertising gain their teachers receive
through connection with them. Such
schools as these stand no comparison
with the professional schools of Ger
many. Their foundation is precari
ous, they cannot demand high stand
ards, nor look beyond present neces
sities to the future of professional
training. Only a few of our profes
sional schools today demand univer
sity standards. Those who do not
cannot share the university spirit.
They have no part in university
development. Only in the degree
that they are part and parcel of
the university do they in general
deserve to live. The first pro
fession to become thus allied is
that of engineering, thanks to the
wisdom that directed the Morrill Act.
Following this, law, medicine, theol
ogy, education, have in some quar
ters, taken a university basis, and the
few professional schools in which such
a basis exists rank fairly with the best
of their class in the world.
Thecrowningfunction ofa university
is that of original research. On this
rests the advance of civilization. From
the application of scientific knowledge
most of the successes of the Nine
teenth Century have arisen. It is the
first era of science. Behind the ap
plication of such knowledge rests the
acquisition of it. One Helmholtz, the
investigator, is the parent of a thou
sand Edisons, the adapters of the
knowledge gained by others. The
great function of the German
university is that of instruction
through investigation. The stu
dent begins his work on a narrow
space at the outer rim of knowledge.
It is his duty to carry the solid
ground a little farther, to drive back
ever so little it may be the darkness
of ignorance and mystery. The real

university is a school of research.
That we possess the university spirit
is our only excuse that we adopt the
university name. A true university
is not a collection of colleges. It is
not a college with an outer fringe of
professional schools. It is not a clus
ter of professional schools. It is the
association of scholars. It is the insti
tution from which in every direction
blazes the light of original research.
Its choicest product is "that fanati
cism for veracity," as Huxley calls
it, that love for truth, without which
man is but the toy of the elements.
Its spirit is the desire "to know
things as they really are," which is
the necessary attribute of "him that
overcometh." No institution can be
college, professional school, and uni
versity all in one, and exercise all
these functions fully in the four years
which form the traditional college
course. To attempt it is to fail in
one way or another. We do at
tempt it and we do fail. In the engi
neering courses of today we try to
combine in four years professional
training with research and culture.
This cannot be done, for while the
professional work is reasonably com
plete, culture is at a minimum, and
research crowded to the wall. The
subject of law requires three solid
years for professional training alone.
Three or four culture years go with this,
and are surely none too many. The
same requirement must soon be made
in Engineering. We cannot make an
engineer in four years if we do any
thing else for him, and there are very
many things besides engineering
which go to the making of a real
engineer.
Hut this we can do in the four years
of college culture: We can show the
student the line of his professional
advancement, and can see him well
started in its direction before he has
taken his first degree. We can give
in the college course something of
the methods and results of advanced
research. In any subject the ad
vanced work has a higher culture
value than elementary work. Thor
ough study of one subject is more
helpful than superficial knowledge of
half a dozen. To know one thing
well is, in Agassiz's words, "to have
the backbone of culture." By limit
ing the range of individual training to
a few things done thoroughly it is
possible to give even to the under
graduate some touch of real univer
sity method, some knowledge of how
truth is won. To accomplish this is
one vital part of the university's duty.
It welds together the three functions
of a university, and in so doing it will
give the American university its most
characteristic feature.
The best education for any man
with brains and character should in
volve these three elements:
It should have the final goal in
view as soon as possible.
It should be broad enough and
thorough enough to develop cultured
manhood, and at the same time to
furnish the strength needed to reach
this goal. In other words, it should
look to success in the profession and
to success as a man. Toward both
these ends the methods of finding the
truth for one's self are vitally essential.
The university should disclose the
secret of power, and this secret lies in
thoroughness. Science is human
experience tested and set in order.
The advance of science has come
through the use of instruments of
precision and methods of precision.
Opinion, feeling, tradition, plausibil
ity, illusions of whatever sort, disap
pear when the method of power is
once mastered.
The college course should have a

little of the professional spirit for its
guidance, a little of the university
spirit for its inspiration; the best in
terests of all three will keep them in
the closest relation to each other. At
the same they must not starve each
other. At the present time the needs
of the college in most cases tend to
dwarf the more costly functions of the
university. The professors have their
hands full of lower work. The books
and material the university work de
mand are far more costly than the
college can afford. The trustees still
too often regard the graduate school
as an expensive alien, and its de
mands in most quarters still receive
scant attention. To train fifty inves
tigators costs more than to give a
thousand men a college education.
The sciences cost more than the hu
manities, and the applied sciences,
with their vast and changing array of
machinery, are most expensive of all.
Equally unwise, it seems to me,
though less common, is the disposi
tion to slight the college course for
the sake of advanced research. Poor
work, wherever done, leaves its mark
of poverty. The great university of
the future will be the one which does
well whatever it undertakes, be it
high or low. Better have few de
partments, very few, than that any
should be weak and paltry. Better
few students well taught than many
neglected.
It is fair to judge a university by
the character of its advanced work.
Institutions cannot be graded by the
number in attendance. This is the
most frequent and most vulgar gauge
of relative standing. The rank of an
institution is determined no more by
the number of its students than by
the number of trees on its campus.
W r hat sort of men does it have, and
what are they doing ? These are the
living questions. Buildings are conven
ient; beautiful buildings have a great
culture value. We should be the last
to under-rate the effect of the charm
of cloisters and towers, of circles of
palms and sweet-toned bells. But
these do not make a university.
Books are useful, they are vital to re
search, but wiser men than we have
ever known have grown up without
books. Shakspere had few of them,
Lincoln but few, Homer and Jesus
none at all. Books serve no purpose
if they are not used. The man who
reads it gives the book its life.
Specimens are inevitable in natural
history. Apparatus is necessary in
physical science. Collections and
equipment are really the outgrowth
of the men that use them. You can
not order them in advance. Pro
fessor Haeckel once said, bitterly,
that the results of research in the
great laboratories was in inverse
proportion to the perfection of their
appliances. An investigation may be
lost in multiplicity of details, or in
elaboration of preparation. Some
men will spend years in getting a
microscope or a microtome just right
and then never use it. It is said
that the entire outfit of Joseph Leidy,
one of the greatest of our microsco
pists, cost just seventy-five dollars.
It was the man and not the equip
ment that made his investigations
luminous.
Publication is necessary, but it
would be the greatest of mistakes to
measure a university by the number
of pages printed by its members.
Much of the so-called research, even
in Germany, is unworthy of the name
of science. Its subject matter is not
extension of human experience, but
the addition to human pedantry. To
count the twists and turns of literary
eccentricity may have no more intel
lectual significance than to count the
dead leaves in the forest. Statistical
work is justified not by the labor it
requires, but by the laws it unveils.
Elaboration of method may conceal
the dearth of purpose. Moreover, it
is easier to string the web of plausi
bility than to recover the lost clue ol
truth. Of a thousand doctors' theses
each year, scarcely one in a hun
dred contains a real addition to
knowledge. When it does it
may be that the hand of the
master placed it there. In too many
cases a piece of research is simply a
bid for notice. American universi
ties are always 011 the watch for men
who can do something as it should
be done. Work is often done solely
to arrest the attention of the univer
sity authorities. A professorship once
gained, nothing more is heard of re
search. The love of novelty with the
itch for writing often passes for the
power of original research. The fan
aticism for veracity has nothing in
common with versatile writing or
paradoxical cleverness. It took Dar
win twenty-five years of the severest
work before he could get his own
leave to print his own conclusions.
Other writers put forth sweeping gen
eralizations as rapidly as their type
writers can take them from dictation.
In certain works which have arrested
popular attention, the investigations
must have gone on at the highest
speed attainable by the pen of the
gifted author. Such work justifies
Fechner's sarcastic phrase, "Cuckoo's
eggs laid in the nest of science."
The work of science is addressed
to science, no matter if half a dozen
generations pass before another inves
tigator takes up the thread. The
science of the newspapers is of quite
another type, and so is much of the
science of just now famous men from
whom newspaper science derives its
inspiration.
While the university on its human
side is interested in all that touches
the life of today, on the scientific side
it deals with the eternal verities, and
cares nothing for those things which
are merely local or timely.
The University must conduct re
search to ends of power. This it has
hardly begun to do in America. Half
our graduate students are not ready
for anything to be called investiga
tion. They are not real students of
a real university. The graduate de
partments of our universities are now
engaged almost exclusively in train
ing teachers. That profession may
be the noblest—where noble men
make it so, but it is only one of many
in which success must rest on orig
inal investigation. We are proud of
our crop of Doctors of Philosophy,
dozens or hundreds turned out
every year. But most of them
are trained only toteach, and we
know that half of them are pre
destined to failure as college teach
ers. We must broaden our work
and widen our sympathies. We must
train men in the higher effectiveness
in every walk in life, men of business
as well as college instructors, states
men as well as linguists, and ship
builders as well as mathematicians,
men of action as well as men of
thought. This means a great deal
more than annual crops of Doctors of
Philosophy to scramble for the few
dozen vacant instructorships open
year by year. But with all these dis
couragements original research is the
loftiest function of the university.
In its consummate excellence is found
the motive for its imitation.
There is but one way in which a
university can discharge this function.
It cannot give prizes for research. It
cannot stimulate it by means of pub

lication, still less by hiring men to
come to its walls to pursue it. The
whole system of fellowships for ad
vanced students is on trial, with most
of the evidence against it. The students
paid to study are not the ones who do
the work. When they are such, they
would have done the work unpaid.
The fellowship system tends to turn
science into almsgiving, to make the
promising youth feel that the world
owes him a living.
All these plans of university build
and others, have been fairly
tried in America. There is but
one that succeeds. Those who
do original work will train oth
ers to do it. Where the teachers are
themselves original investigators de
voted to truth and skilful in the
search for it—men that cannot be
frightened, fatigued, or discouraged
—they will have students like them
selves. To work under such men
students like-minded will come from
the ends of the earth. It is the part of
the investigators to make the univer
sity,as the teachers makes the college.
There never was a genuine univer
sity on any other terms. It is not
conceivable that there should ever be
one. It is not necessary that all de
partments should be equal to make
the university real. It was enough
at Harvard to have Agassiz and Gray,
Lowell, Goodwin, and Holmes, to
justify the name of university. Silli
man and Dana made a university of
Yale. Such men are as rare as they
are choice, and no university faculty
was ever yet composed of them alone,
and none ever yet had too many of
them. President Gilman has wisely
said:
" In the conduct of a university se
cure the ablest men as professors,
regardless of all other qualifications,
excepting those of personal merit and
adaptation to the chairs that are to
be filled. Borrow if you cannot en
list. Give them freedom. Give them
auxiliaries. Give them liberal sup
port. Encourage them to come be
fore the world of science and of let
ters with their publications. Bright
students, soon to be men of distinc
tion, will be their loyal followers, and
the world will say Amen.
'' The merit of a university depends
on the men who are called to conduct
it, upon them absolutely if not exclu
sively; for although the teacher must
have such auxiliaries as books and in
struments —books are nothing but
paper and ink until they are read,
and instruments but brass and glass
until craft and skill are applied to
their handling."
But it is in its men that the real
university has its real being. Through
the work of such men it stands in the
vanguard of civilization. By such
men it counts the milestones in its
course, and no trick of organization,
no urging of the printing-press, no
subsidy of students, can be made to
take their place.
A final word as to the practical side
of advanced research. Mr. Carnegie
once ascribed the foundation of his
great fortune to the fact that lie first
employed trained chemists where
other manufacturers chose workmen
skilled in making steel by rule of
thumb. His chemists were able to
suggest improvements. They de
vised ways of making better steel
cheaper still, and at the same time of
utilizing the refuse or slag
In the future the success of each
great enterprise must depend on the
improvements it makes. The nation
successful in manufacture and com
merce will be the one richest in labor
aiding devices. All these must de
' pend on the advancement of knowl

edge. Pure science must precede
applied science.
Once the manufacturer or the na
tion could hire its chemists as it needed
them. The few asked for were al
ready made. Now they must make
them. The advancement of any
branch of science depends 011 the
mastery of what is known before.
Everything easy and everything in
expensive has been found out. To
train the chemist of the future we
need constantly finer instruments of
precision for his advanced work, ac
cess to greater and greater libraries
that he may know what is already
done, for each generation of scientific
workers must stand on the shoulders
of those gone before, else it can make
110 progress beyond them. The
scholars of today would be helpless
were it not that they can save time
by drawing freely on the accumulated
knowledge of the past.
To learn the elements of any science
costs little. It can be learned at one
end of a log with a great teacher on
the other. It can be even learned
without a teacher. But to master a
science so as to extend its boundaries
—this is quite another thing. More
than a man can earn in a lifetime it
costs to make a start. For this rea
son a university which provides means
for such work is a very costly estab
lishment. For this reason the inves
tigator of the future must depend on
the university. The nation with
the best equipped universities will
furnished the best-trained men. On
the universities the progress in man
ufactures and commerce must depend.
Through the superiority of training
Germany is passing England in the
commercial world in spite of her
handicaps of position and history.
Through the excellence of her uni
versities, without most of these hand
icaps, America is likely to excel both
Germany and England.
As men of science are needed,they
cannot make themselves. Those with
power can help them. This fact has
given the impulse to the far-reaching
gifts of Stanford, Rockefeller, Carne
gie, and Rhodes. These are not gifts
but investments put to the credit of
the country's future. The people,
too, have power to give. The
same feeling of investment has
led them to build their state
universities, and to entrust to
them not only the work of per
sonal culture, but of advancement in
literature, science, and arts. With
general culture and professional train
ing must go the advancement of
knowledge, the progress of society,
through the advancement of the wis
dom and the power of man.
The roll of the Alumni of our Uni
versity now numbers more than 1600
names. Men and women of Stan
ford, they are scattered far and wide
over the whole earth, and in their
various ways each one is doing honor
to the training in effectiveness and
character given them by their Alma
Mater. The roll is a roll of honor,
and to this list today as youth of
promise, young men and young
women of the Republic, the Leland
Stanford Junior University is glad
and proud to add your names as well,
confident that in the days to come
your Alma Mater shall be glad and
proud to say, " These too are my
children."
With the end of our Republic's first
century we had the first clear vision
of the greatest of republican institu
tions the American university. It
was even then only a vision. It is not
yet realized, but we know something
of what it is to be. Out of the strug
gles and the prayers, the hopes and the
efforts of good men and good women,
wesee it taking form. A university as
fair as those which England has
known fora thousand years, as sound
and as strong as the deep-rooted
schools of Germany, with something
of both, yet different from either, is
the coining University of America.
There will be many of these institu
tions, for our land is very wide, and
they will differ from each other some
what in kind, and as one star differ
eth from another in glory, still of the
same general pattern all must be. They
will be schools for training American
boys and girls to be American men and
women. They will express the loftiest
ideals of higher education within our
great democracy. One of this great
sisterhood of universities our own
Stanford must become, hence it is fit
ting for us, from time to time, to con
sider the present, and to forecast the
future.
The American college, as it existed
thirty years ago and more, and as it
still exists in some quarters, is dis
tinctly a school for personal culture.
Its strongest agency has been the
personal influence of devoted men. It
has made no effort to give profes
sional training. It has made no pre
tense of leading in scientific research.
A log with Mark Hopkins at one end
of it and himself at the other was
Garfield's conception of such a col
lege. Even the log is not essential.
The earnest teacher is all in all. Ap
paratus Mark Hopkins did not need,
books he even despised. The medium
of a forgotten language and an out
worn philosophy served him as well
as anything else in impressing on his
boys the stamp of his own character.
It was said of Dr. Nott of Union Col
lege that "He took the sweepings of
other colleges and sent them back to
society pure gold." Such was his
personal influence on young men.
A notable example of the college
spirit was Arnold of Rugby. Another
was Jowett, Master of Baliol. A
teacher of this type, in greater or less
degree, it was the privilege of every
college student to know, and this
knowledge still reconciles him to his
alma mater, however many her
shortcomings in subject or method.
Hut times have changed since the
days of Mark Hopkins. The Ameri
can college —Knglish born and Eng

lish in tradition—under the touch of
German influences, and in response
to actual needs, is changing to the
American university. It is no longer
a school of culture alone, a school of
personal growth through personal ex
ample. It is becoming, in addition
to this, a school of research, a school
of power. It stands in the advance
guard of civilization, responsive not
to the truth of tradition alone but to
the new truth daily and hourly re
vealed in the experience of man.
In the movement of events the
American university unites in itself
three different functions: that of the
college, that of the professional school,
and that which is distinctive of the
university.
The college is now, as ever, a school
of culture. It aims to make wise,
sane, well-rounded men who know
something of the best that men have
thought and done in this world, and
whose lives will be the better for this
knowledge. It has not discarded the
Latin, Greek, and Mathematics which
were so long the chief agents in cul
ture, but it has greatly added to this
list. It has found that to some minds,
at least, better results arise from the
study of other things. Culture is born
from mastery. The mind is strength
ened by what it can assimilate. It
can use only that which relates itself
to life. We find that Greek-minded
ness is necessary to receive from the
Greek all that this noblest of lan
guages is competent to give. We
find for the average man better educa
tional substance in English than in
Latin, in the Physical or Natural
Sciences than in the Calculus. Hut
more important than this, we find
that it is safe in the main to trust the
choice of studies to the student him
self. The very fact of choice is in
itself an education. It is better to
choose wrong, sometimes, as we do
a hundred times in life, than to be
arbitrarily directed to the best selec
tion. Moreover, so far as culture is
concerned, the best teacher is more
important than the best study. It is
still true, as Emerson once wrote to
his daughter, that "It matters little
what your studies are; it all lies in
who your teacher is." A large insti
tution has many students. It has
likewise many teachers, and an Ar
nold or a Hopkins, a Warner or a
Thoburn, can come just as close to
the students' hearts in a large school
as in a small one. But "the know
ing of men by name," the care for
their personal lives and characters,
must be the essential element in the
new college course as it was in the
old. And the college function of the
university must not be despised or
belittled. Because Germany has no
colleges, because her students go di
rectly from the high school at home
to the professional school or the uni
versity, some have urged the aban
donment by the American university
of this primal function of general cul
ture. In their eagerness to develop
the advanced work some institutions
have relegated the college function
almost solely to tutors without exper
ience, and have left it without stand
ards and without serious purpose. It
is not right that even the Freshmen
should be poorly taught. On the
soundness of the college training
everything else must depend. In the
long run the greatest university will
be the one that devotes the most care
to its undergraduates. With the col
lege graduation higher education in
England mostly stops. With Ger
many here the higher education he

fined as that training which demands
that a man should leave home. It
means a breaking of the leading

lives at home in a city, and goes back

versity student. He may recite in
the university classes, but there his
relation ends. He gets little of the
spirit which moves outside of the class

sity until he breathes the university
atmosphere. The "Spurstudenten,"
or "railway students," those who
come and go on the trains, are right
ly held by their fellows in Germany
to be little more than Philistines.
Whatever the other excellencies of
the German system, the gymnasium,
or advanced high school, is an inade
quate substitute for the American col
lege.
The second function of the univer
sity is that of professional training.
To the man once in the path of cul
ture this school adds effectiveness in
his chosen calling. This work the
American universities have taken up
slowly and grudgingly. The demand
for instruction in law and medicine
has been met weakly but extensively
by private enterprise. The schools
thus founded have been dependent
on the students' fees, and on the ad

schools as these stand no comparison

ous, they cannot demand high stand
ards, nor look beyond present neces
sities to the future of professional
training. Only a few of our profes
sional schools today demand univer
sity standards. Those who do not
cannot share the university spirit.
They have no part in university
development. Only in the degree
that they are part and parcel of
the university do they in general
deserve to live. The first pro
fession to become thus allied is
that of engineering, thanks to the
wisdom that directed the Morrill Act.
Following this, law, medicine, theol
ogy, education, have in some quar
ters, taken a university basis, and the
few professional schools in which such
a basis exists rank fairly with the best
of their class in the world.
Thecrowningfunction ofa university
is that of original research. On this
rests the advance of civilization. From
the application of scientific knowledge
most of the successes of the Nine
teenth Century have arisen. It is the
first era of science. Behind the ap
plication of such knowledge rests the
acquisition of it. One Helmholtz, the
investigator, is the parent of a thou
sand Edisons, the adapters of the
knowledge gained by others. The
great function of the German
university is that of instruction
through investigation. The stu
dent begins his work on a narrow
space at the outer rim of knowledge.
It is his duty to carry the solid
ground a little farther, to drive back
ever so little it may be the darkness
of ignorance and mystery. The real

university is a school of research.
That we possess the university spirit
is our only excuse that we adopt the

not a college with an outer fringe of

Its spirit is the desire "to know

these functions fully in the four years

one way or another. We do at

This cannot be done, for while the
professional work is reasonably com
plete, culture is at a minimum, and
research crowded to the wall. The
subject of law requires three solid
years for professional training alone.
Three or four culture years go with this,
and are surely none too many. The
same requirement must soon be made
in Engineering. We cannot make an
engineer in four years if we do any
thing else for him, and there are very
many things besides engineering
which go to the making of a real
engineer.
Hut this we can do in the four years
of college culture: We can show the
student the line of his professional
advancement, and can see him well
started in its direction before he has
taken his first degree. We can give
in the college course something of
the methods and results of advanced
research. In any subject the ad
vanced work has a higher culture
value than elementary work. Thor
ough study of one subject is more
helpful than superficial knowledge of
half a dozen. To know one thing
well is, in Agassiz's words, "to have
the backbone of culture." By limit
ing the range of individual training to
a few things done thoroughly it is
possible to give even to the under
graduate some touch of real univer
sity method, some knowledge of how
truth is won. To accomplish this is
one vital part of the university's duty.
It welds together the three functions
of a university, and in so doing it will
give the American university its most
characteristic feature.
The best education for any man
with brains and character should in
volve these three elements:
It should have the final goal in
view as soon as possible.
It should be broad enough and
thorough enough to develop cultured
manhood, and at the same time to
furnish the strength needed to reach
this goal. In other words, it should
look to success in the profession and
to success as a man. Toward both
these ends the methods of finding the
truth for one's self are vitally essential.
The university should disclose the
secret of power, and this secret lies in
thoroughness. Science is human
experience tested and set in order.
The advance of science has come
through the use of instruments of
precision and methods of precision.
Opinion, feeling, tradition, plausibil
ity, illusions of whatever sort, disap
pear when the method of power is
once mastered.
The college course should have a

little of the professional spirit for its
guidance, a little of the university
spirit for its inspiration; the best in
terests of all three will keep them in
the closest relation to each other. At
the same they must not starve each
other. At the present time the needs
of the college in most cases tend to
dwarf the more costly functions of the
university. The professors have their
hands full of lower work. The books
and material the university work de
mand are far more costly than the
college can afford. The trustees still
too often regard the graduate school
as an expensive alien, and its de
mands in most quarters still receive
scant attention. To train fifty inves
tigators costs more than to give a
thousand men a college education.
The sciences cost more than the hu
manities, and the applied sciences,
with their vast and changing array of
machinery, are most expensive of all.
Equally unwise, it seems to me,
though less common, is the disposi
tion to slight the college course for
the sake of advanced research. Poor
work, wherever done, leaves its mark
of poverty. The great university of
the future will be the one which does
well whatever it undertakes, be it
high or low. Better have few de
partments, very few, than that any
should be weak and paltry. Better
few students well taught than many
neglected.
It is fair to judge a university by
the character of its advanced work.
Institutions cannot be graded by the
number in attendance. This is the
most frequent and most vulgar gauge
of relative standing. The rank of an
institution is determined no more by
the number of its students than by
the number of trees on its campus.
W r hat sort of men does it have, and
what are they doing ? These are the
living questions. Buildings are conven
ient; beautiful buildings have a great
culture value. We should be the last
to under-rate the effect of the charm
of cloisters and towers, of circles of
palms and sweet-toned bells. But
these do not make a university.
Books are useful, they are vital to re
search, but wiser men than we have
ever known have grown up without
books. Shakspere had few of them,
Lincoln but few, Homer and Jesus
none at all. Books serve no purpose
if they are not used. The man who
reads it gives the book its life.
Specimens are inevitable in natural
history. Apparatus is necessary in
physical science. Collections and
equipment are really the outgrowth
of the men that use them. You can
not order them in advance. Pro
fessor Haeckel once said, bitterly,
that the results of research in the
great laboratories was in inverse
proportion to the perfection of their
appliances. An investigation may be
lost in multiplicity of details, or in
elaboration of preparation. Some
men will spend years in getting a
microscope or a microtome just right
and then never use it. It is said
that the entire outfit of Joseph Leidy,
one of the greatest of our microsco
pists, cost just seventy-five dollars.
It was the man and not the equip
ment that made his investigations
luminous.
Publication is necessary, but it
would be the greatest of mistakes to
measure a university by the number
of pages printed by its members.
Much of the so-called research, even
in Germany, is unworthy of the name
of science. Its subject matter is not
extension of human experience, but
the addition to human pedantry. To
count the twists and turns of literary
eccentricity may have no more intel
lectual significance than to count the
dead leaves in the forest. Statistical
work is justified not by the labor it
requires, but by the laws it unveils.
Elaboration of method may conceal
the dearth of purpose. Moreover, it
is easier to string the web of plausi
bility than to recover the lost clue ol
truth. Of a thousand doctors' theses
each year, scarcely one in a hun
dred contains a real addition to
knowledge. When it does it
may be that the hand of the
master placed it there. In too many
cases a piece of research is simply a
bid for notice. American universi
ties are always 011 the watch for men
who can do something as it should
be done. Work is often done solely
to arrest the attention of the univer
sity authorities. A professorship once
gained, nothing more is heard of re
search. The love of novelty with the
itch for writing often passes for the
power of original research. The fan
aticism for veracity has nothing in
common with versatile writing or
paradoxical cleverness. It took Dar
win twenty-five years of the severest
work before he could get his own
leave to print his own conclusions.
Other writers put forth sweeping gen
eralizations as rapidly as their type
writers can take them from dictation.
In certain works which have arrested
popular attention, the investigations
must have gone on at the highest
speed attainable by the pen of the
gifted author. Such work justifies
Fechner's sarcastic phrase, "Cuckoo's
eggs laid in the nest of science."
The work of science is addressed
to science, no matter if half a dozen
generations pass before another inves
tigator takes up the thread. The
science of the newspapers is of quite
another type, and so is much of the
science of just now famous men from
whom newspaper science derives its
inspiration.
While the university on its human
side is interested in all that touches
the life of today, on the scientific side
it deals with the eternal verities, and
cares nothing for those things which
are merely local or timely.
The University must conduct re
search to ends of power. This it has
hardly begun to do in America. Half
our graduate students are not ready
for anything to be called investiga
tion. They are not real students of
a real university. The graduate de
partments of our universities are now
engaged almost exclusively in train
ing teachers. That profession may
be the noblest—where noble men
make it so, but it is only one of many
in which success must rest on orig
inal investigation. We are proud of
our crop of Doctors of Philosophy,
dozens or hundreds turned out
every year. But most of them
are trained only toteach, and we
know that half of them are pre
destined to failure as college teach
ers. We must broaden our work
and widen our sympathies. We must
train men in the higher effectiveness
in every walk in life, men of business
as well as college instructors, states
men as well as linguists, and ship
builders as well as mathematicians,
men of action as well as men of
thought. This means a great deal
more than annual crops of Doctors of
Philosophy to scramble for the few
dozen vacant instructorships open
year by year. But with all these dis
couragements original research is the
loftiest function of the university.
In its consummate excellence is found
the motive for its imitation.
There is but one way in which a
university can discharge this function.
It cannot give prizes for research. It
cannot stimulate it by means of pub

lication, still less by hiring men to
come to its walls to pursue it. The
whole system of fellowships for ad
vanced students is on trial, with most
of the evidence against it. The students
paid to study are not the ones who do
the work. When they are such, they
would have done the work unpaid.
The fellowship system tends to turn
science into almsgiving, to make the
promising youth feel that the world
owes him a living.
All these plans of university build
and others, have been fairly
tried in America. There is but
one that succeeds. Those who
do original work will train oth
ers to do it. Where the teachers are
themselves original investigators de
voted to truth and skilful in the
search for it—men that cannot be
frightened, fatigued, or discouraged
—they will have students like them
selves. To work under such men
students like-minded will come from
the ends of the earth. It is the part of
the investigators to make the univer
sity,as the teachers makes the college.
There never was a genuine univer
sity on any other terms. It is not
conceivable that there should ever be
one. It is not necessary that all de
partments should be equal to make
the university real. It was enough
at Harvard to have Agassiz and Gray,
Lowell, Goodwin, and Holmes, to
justify the name of university. Silli
man and Dana made a university of
Yale. Such men are as rare as they
are choice, and no university faculty
was ever yet composed of them alone,
and none ever yet had too many of
them. President Gilman has wisely
said:
" In the conduct of a university se
cure the ablest men as professors,
regardless of all other qualifications,
excepting those of personal merit and
adaptation to the chairs that are to
be filled. Borrow if you cannot en
list. Give them freedom. Give them
auxiliaries. Give them liberal sup
port. Encourage them to come be
fore the world of science and of let
ters with their publications. Bright
students, soon to be men of distinc
tion, will be their loyal followers, and
the world will say Amen.
'' The merit of a university depends
on the men who are called to conduct
it, upon them absolutely if not exclu
sively; for although the teacher must
have such auxiliaries as books and in
struments —books are nothing but
paper and ink until they are read,
and instruments but brass and glass
until craft and skill are applied to
their handling."
But it is in its men that the real
university has its real being. Through
the work of such men it stands in the
vanguard of civilization. By such
men it counts the milestones in its
course, and no trick of organization,
no urging of the printing-press, no
subsidy of students, can be made to
take their place.
A final word as to the practical side
of advanced research. Mr. Carnegie
once ascribed the foundation of his
great fortune to the fact that lie first
employed trained chemists where
other manufacturers chose workmen
skilled in making steel by rule of
thumb. His chemists were able to
suggest improvements. They de
vised ways of making better steel
cheaper still, and at the same time of
utilizing the refuse or slag
In the future the success of each
great enterprise must depend on the
improvements it makes. The nation
successful in manufacture and com
merce will be the one richest in labor
aiding devices. All these must de
' pend on the advancement of knowl

edge. Pure science must precede
applied science.
Once the manufacturer or the na
tion could hire its chemists as it needed
them. The few asked for were al
ready made. Now they must make
them. The advancement of any
branch of science depends 011 the
mastery of what is known before.
Everything easy and everything in
expensive has been found out. To
train the chemist of the future we
need constantly finer instruments of
precision for his advanced work, ac
cess to greater and greater libraries
that he may know what is already
done, for each generation of scientific
workers must stand on the shoulders
of those gone before, else it can make
110 progress beyond them. The
scholars of today would be helpless
were it not that they can save time
by drawing freely on the accumulated
knowledge of the past.
To learn the elements of any science
costs little. It can be learned at one
end of a log with a great teacher on
the other. It can be even learned
without a teacher. But to master a
science so as to extend its boundaries
—this is quite another thing. More
than a man can earn in a lifetime it
costs to make a start. For this rea
son a university which provides means
for such work is a very costly estab
lishment. For this reason the inves
tigator of the future must depend on
the university. The nation with
the best equipped universities will
furnished the best-trained men. On
the universities the progress in man
ufactures and commerce must depend.
Through the superiority of training
Germany is passing England in the
commercial world in spite of her
handicaps of position and history.
Through the excellence of her uni
versities, without most of these hand
icaps, America is likely to excel both
Germany and England.
As men of science are needed,they
cannot make themselves. Those with
power can help them. This fact has
given the impulse to the far-reaching
gifts of Stanford, Rockefeller, Carne
gie, and Rhodes. These are not gifts
but investments put to the credit of
the country's future. The people,
too, have power to give. The
same feeling of investment has
led them to build their state
universities, and to entrust to
them not only the work of per
sonal culture, but of advancement in
literature, science, and arts. With
general culture and professional train
ing must go the advancement of
knowledge, the progress of society,
through the advancement of the wis
dom and the power of man.
The roll of the Alumni of our Uni
versity now numbers more than 1600
names. Men and women of Stan
ford, they are scattered far and wide
over the whole earth, and in their
various ways each one is doing honor
to the training in effectiveness and
character given them by their Alma
Mater. The roll is a roll of honor,
and to this list today as youth of
promise, young men and young
women of the Republic, the Leland
Stanford Junior University is glad
and proud to add your names as well,
confident that in the days to come
your Alma Mater shall be glad and
proud to say, " These too are my
children."
With the end of our Republic's first
century we had the first clear vision
of the greatest of republican institu
tions the American university. It
was even then only a vision. It is not
yet realized, but we know something
of what it is to be. Out of the strug
gles and the prayers, the hopes and the
efforts of good men and good women,
wesee it taking form. A university as
fair as those which England has
known fora thousand years, as sound
and as strong as the deep-rooted
schools of Germany, with something
of both, yet different from either, is
the coining University of America.
There will be many of these institu
tions, for our land is very wide, and
they will differ from each other some
what in kind, and as one star differ
eth from another in glory, still of the
same general pattern all must be. They
will be schools for training American
boys and girls to be American men and
women. They will express the loftiest
ideals of higher education within our
great democracy. One of this great
sisterhood of universities our own
Stanford must become, hence it is fit
ting for us, from time to time, to con
sider the present, and to forecast the
future.
The American college, as it existed
thirty years ago and more, and as it
still exists in some quarters, is dis
tinctly a school for personal culture.
Its strongest agency has been the
personal influence of devoted men. It
has made no effort to give profes
sional training. It has made no pre
tense of leading in scientific research.
A log with Mark Hopkins at one end
of it and himself at the other was
Garfield's conception of such a col
lege. Even the log is not essential.
The earnest teacher is all in all. Ap
paratus Mark Hopkins did not need,
books he even despised. The medium
of a forgotten language and an out
worn philosophy served him as well
as anything else in impressing on his
boys the stamp of his own character.
It was said of Dr. Nott of Union Col
lege that "He took the sweepings of
other colleges and sent them back to
society pure gold." Such was his
personal influence on young men.
A notable example of the college
spirit was Arnold of Rugby. Another
was Jowett, Master of Baliol. A
teacher of this type, in greater or less
degree, it was the privilege of every
college student to know, and this
knowledge still reconciles him to his
alma mater, however many her
shortcomings in subject or method.
Hut times have changed since the
days of Mark Hopkins. The Ameri
can college —Knglish born and Eng

lish in tradition—under the touch of
German influences, and in response
to actual needs, is changing to the
American university. It is no longer
a school of culture alone, a school of
personal growth through personal ex
ample. It is becoming, in addition
to this, a school of research, a school
of power. It stands in the advance
guard of civilization, responsive not
to the truth of tradition alone but to
the new truth daily and hourly re
vealed in the experience of man.
In the movement of events the
American university unites in itself
three different functions: that of the
college, that of the professional school,
and that which is distinctive of the
university.
The college is now, as ever, a school
of culture. It aims to make wise,
sane, well-rounded men who know
something of the best that men have
thought and done in this world, and
whose lives will be the better for this
knowledge. It has not discarded the
Latin, Greek, and Mathematics which
were so long the chief agents in cul
ture, but it has greatly added to this
list. It has found that to some minds,
at least, better results arise from the
study of other things. Culture is born
from mastery. The mind is strength
ened by what it can assimilate. It
can use only that which relates itself
to life. We find that Greek-minded
ness is necessary to receive from the
Greek all that this noblest of lan
guages is competent to give. We
find for the average man better educa
tional substance in English than in
Latin, in the Physical or Natural
Sciences than in the Calculus. Hut
more important than this, we find
that it is safe in the main to trust the
choice of studies to the student him
self. The very fact of choice is in
itself an education. It is better to
choose wrong, sometimes, as we do
a hundred times in life, than to be
arbitrarily directed to the best selec
tion. Moreover, so far as culture is
concerned, the best teacher is more
important than the best study. It is
still true, as Emerson once wrote to
his daughter, that "It matters little
what your studies are; it all lies in
who your teacher is." A large insti
tution has many students. It has
likewise many teachers, and an Ar
nold or a Hopkins, a Warner or a
Thoburn, can come just as close to
the students' hearts in a large school
as in a small one. But "the know
ing of men by name," the care for
their personal lives and characters,
must be the essential element in the
new college course as it was in the
old. And the college function of the
university must not be despised or
belittled. Because Germany has no
colleges, because her students go di
rectly from the high school at home
to the professional school or the uni
versity, some have urged the aban
donment by the American university
of this primal function of general cul
ture. In their eagerness to develop
the advanced work some institutions
have relegated the college function
almost solely to tutors without exper
ience, and have left it without stand
ards and without serious purpose. It
is not right that even the Freshmen
should be poorly taught. On the
soundness of the college training
everything else must depend. In the
long run the greatest university will
be the one that devotes the most care
to its undergraduates. With the col
lege graduation higher education in
England mostly stops. With Ger
many here the higher education he
gins. Higher education has been de
fined as that training which demands
that a man should leave home. It
means a breaking of the leading
strings. It means the entrance to
another atmosphere. The high school
and the gymnasium cannot have the
academic atmosphere, however ad
vanced their studies may be. They
must reflect the spirit of the town
which supports them, and of which
they are necessarily a part. They
cannot be free in the sense in which
the universities are free. A boy who
lives at home in a city, and goes back
and forth on a train, cannot be a uni
versity student. He may recite in
the university classes, but there his
relation ends. He gets little of the
spirit which moves outside of the class
room. He cannot enter the univer
sity until he breathes the university
atmosphere. The "Spurstudenten,"
or "railway students," those who
come and go on the trains, are right
ly held by their fellows in Germany
to be little more than Philistines.
Whatever the other excellencies of
the German system, the gymnasium,
or advanced high school, is an inade
quate substitute for the American col
lege.
The second function of the univer
sity is that of professional training.
To the man once in the path of cul
ture this school adds effectiveness in
his chosen calling. This work the
American universities have taken up
slowly and grudgingly. The demand
for instruction in law and medicine
has been met weakly but extensively
by private enterprise. The schools
thus founded have been dependent
on the students' fees, and on the ad
vertising gain their teachers receive
through connection with them. Such
schools as these stand no comparison
with the professional schools of Ger
many. Their foundation is precari
ous, they cannot demand high stand
ards, nor look beyond present neces
sities to the future of professional
training. Only a few of our profes
sional schools today demand univer
sity standards. Those who do not
cannot share the university spirit.
They have no part in university
development. Only in the degree
that they are part and parcel of
the university do they in general
deserve to live. The first pro
fession to become thus allied is
that of engineering, thanks to the
wisdom that directed the Morrill Act.
Following this, law, medicine, theol
ogy, education, have in some quar
ters, taken a university basis, and the
few professional schools in which such
a basis exists rank fairly with the best
of their class in the world.
Thecrowningfunction ofa university
is that of original research. On this
rests the advance of civilization. From
the application of scientific knowledge
most of the successes of the Nine
teenth Century have arisen. It is the
first era of science. Behind the ap
plication of such knowledge rests the
acquisition of it. One Helmholtz, the
investigator, is the parent of a thou
sand Edisons, the adapters of the
knowledge gained by others. The
great function of the German
university is that of instruction
through investigation. The stu
dent begins his work on a narrow
space at the outer rim of knowledge.
It is his duty to carry the solid
ground a little farther, to drive back
ever so little it may be the darkness
of ignorance and mystery. The real

university is a school of research.
That we possess the university spirit
is our only excuse that we adopt the
university name. A true university
is not a collection of colleges. It is
not a college with an outer fringe of
professional schools. It is not a clus
ter of professional schools. It is the
association of scholars. It is the insti
tution from which in every direction
blazes the light of original research.
Its choicest product is "that fanati
cism for veracity," as Huxley calls
it, that love for truth, without which
man is but the toy of the elements.
Its spirit is the desire "to know
things as they really are," which is
the necessary attribute of "him that
overcometh." No institution can be
college, professional school, and uni
versity all in one, and exercise all
these functions fully in the four years
which form the traditional college
course. To attempt it is to fail in
one way or another. We do at
tempt it and we do fail. In the engi
neering courses of today we try to
combine in four years professional
training with research and culture.
This cannot be done, for while the
professional work is reasonably com
plete, culture is at a minimum, and
research crowded to the wall. The
subject of law requires three solid
years for professional training alone.
Three or four culture years go with this,
and are surely none too many. The
same requirement must soon be made
in Engineering. We cannot make an
engineer in four years if we do any
thing else for him, and there are very
many things besides engineering
which go to the making of a real
engineer.
Hut this we can do in the four years
of college culture: We can show the
student the line of his professional
advancement, and can see him well
started in its direction before he has
taken his first degree. We can give
in the college course something of
the methods and results of advanced
research. In any subject the ad
vanced work has a higher culture
value than elementary work. Thor
ough study of one subject is more
helpful than superficial knowledge of
half a dozen. To know one thing
well is, in Agassiz's words, "to have
the backbone of culture." By limit
ing the range of individual training to
a few things done thoroughly it is
possible to give even to the under
graduate some touch of real univer
sity method, some knowledge of how
truth is won. To accomplish this is
one vital part of the university's duty.
It welds together the three functions
of a university, and in so doing it will
give the American university its most
characteristic feature.
The best education for any man
with brains and character should in
volve these three elements:
It should have the final goal in
view as soon as possible.
It should be broad enough and
thorough enough to develop cultured
manhood, and at the same time to
furnish the strength needed to reach
this goal. In other words, it should
look to success in the profession and
to success as a man. Toward both
these ends the methods of finding the
truth for one's self are vitally essential.
The university should disclose the
secret of power, and this secret lies in
thoroughness. Science is human
experience tested and set in order.
The advance of science has come
through the use of instruments of
precision and methods of precision.
Opinion, feeling, tradition, plausibil
ity, illusions of whatever sort, disap
pear when the method of power is
once mastered.
The college course should have a

little of the professional spirit for its
guidance, a little of the university
spirit for its inspiration; the best in
terests of all three will keep them in
the closest relation to each other. At
the same they must not starve each
other. At the present time the needs
of the college in most cases tend to
dwarf the more costly functions of the
university. The professors have their
hands full of lower work. The books
and material the university work de
mand are far more costly than the
college can afford. The trustees still
too often regard the graduate school
as an expensive alien, and its de
mands in most quarters still receive
scant attention. To train fifty inves
tigators costs more than to give a
thousand men a college education.
The sciences cost more than the hu
manities, and the applied sciences,
with their vast and changing array of
machinery, are most expensive of all.
Equally unwise, it seems to me,
though less common, is the disposi
tion to slight the college course for
the sake of advanced research. Poor
work, wherever done, leaves its mark
of poverty. The great university of
the future will be the one which does
well whatever it undertakes, be it
high or low. Better have few de
partments, very few, than that any
should be weak and paltry. Better
few students well taught than many
neglected.
It is fair to judge a university by
the character of its advanced work.
Institutions cannot be graded by the
number in attendance. This is the
most frequent and most vulgar gauge
of relative standing. The rank of an

the number of its students than by

to under-rate the effect of the charm
of cloisters and towers, of circles of

these do not make a university.
Books are useful, they are vital to re

ever known have grown up without

dead leaves in the forest. Statistical
work is justified not by the labor it
requires, but by the laws it unveils.
Elaboration of method may conceal
the dearth of purpose. Moreover, it
is easier to string the web of plausi
bility than to recover the lost clue ol
truth. Of a thousand doctors' theses
each year, scarcely one in a hun
dred contains a real addition to
knowledge. When it does it
may be that the hand of the
master placed it there. In too many
cases a piece of research is simply a
bid for notice. American universi
ties are always 011 the watch for men
who can do something as it should
be done. Work is often done solely
to arrest the attention of the univer
sity authorities. A professorship once
gained, nothing more is heard of re
search. The love of novelty with the
itch for writing often passes for the
power of original research. The fan
aticism for veracity has nothing in
common with versatile writing or
paradoxical cleverness. It took Dar
win twenty-five years of the severest
work before he could get his own
leave to print his own conclusions.
Other writers put forth sweeping gen
eralizations as rapidly as their type
writers can take them from dictation.
In certain works which have arrested
popular attention, the investigations
must have gone on at the highest
speed attainable by the pen of the
gifted author. Such work justifies
Fechner's sarcastic phrase, "Cuckoo's
eggs laid in the nest of science."
The work of science is addressed
to science, no matter if half a dozen
generations pass before another inves
tigator takes up the thread. The
science of the newspapers is of quite
another type, and so is much of the
science of just now famous men from
whom newspaper science derives its
inspiration.
While the university on its human
side is interested in all that touches
the life of today, on the scientific side
it deals with the eternal verities, and
cares nothing for those things which
are merely local or timely.
The University must conduct re
search to ends of power. This it has
hardly begun to do in America. Half
our graduate students are not ready
for anything to be called investiga
tion. They are not real students of
a real university. The graduate de
partments of our universities are now
engaged almost exclusively in train
ing teachers. That profession may
be the noblest—where noble men
make it so, but it is only one of many
in which success must rest on orig
inal investigation. We are proud of
our crop of Doctors of Philosophy,
dozens or hundreds turned out
every year. But most of them
are trained only toteach, and we
know that half of them are pre
destined to failure as college teach
ers. We must broaden our work
and widen our sympathies. We must
train men in the higher effectiveness
in every walk in life, men of business
as well as college instructors, states
men as well as linguists, and ship
builders as well as mathematicians,
men of action as well as men of
thought. This means a great deal
more than annual crops of Doctors of
Philosophy to scramble for the few
dozen vacant instructorships open
year by year. But with all these dis
couragements original research is the
loftiest function of the university.
In its consummate excellence is found
the motive for its imitation.
There is but one way in which a
university can discharge this function.
It cannot give prizes for research. It
cannot stimulate it by means of pub

lication, still less by hiring men to
come to its walls to pursue it. The
whole system of fellowships for ad
vanced students is on trial, with most
of the evidence against it. The students
paid to study are not the ones who do
the work. When they are such, they
would have done the work unpaid.
The fellowship system tends to turn
science into almsgiving, to make the
promising youth feel that the world
owes him a living.
All these plans of university build
and others, have been fairly
tried in America. There is but
one that succeeds. Those who
do original work will train oth
ers to do it. Where the teachers are
themselves original investigators de
voted to truth and skilful in the
search for it—men that cannot be
frightened, fatigued, or discouraged
—they will have students like them
selves. To work under such men
students like-minded will come from
the ends of the earth. It is the part of
the investigators to make the univer
sity,as the teachers makes the college.
There never was a genuine univer
sity on any other terms. It is not
conceivable that there should ever be
one. It is not necessary that all de
partments should be equal to make
the university real. It was enough
at Harvard to have Agassiz and Gray,
Lowell, Goodwin, and Holmes, to
justify the name of university. Silli
man and Dana made a university of
Yale. Such men are as rare as they
are choice, and no university faculty
was ever yet composed of them alone,
and none ever yet had too many of
them. President Gilman has wisely
said:
" In the conduct of a university se
cure the ablest men as professors,
regardless of all other qualifications,
excepting those of personal merit and
adaptation to the chairs that are to
be filled. Borrow if you cannot en
list. Give them freedom. Give them
auxiliaries. Give them liberal sup
port. Encourage them to come be
fore the world of science and of let
ters with their publications. Bright
students, soon to be men of distinc
tion, will be their loyal followers, and
the world will say Amen.
'' The merit of a university depends
on the men who are called to conduct
it, upon them absolutely if not exclu
sively; for although the teacher must
have such auxiliaries as books and in
struments —books are nothing but
paper and ink until they are read,
and instruments but brass and glass
until craft and skill are applied to
their handling."
But it is in its men that the real
university has its real being. Through
the work of such men it stands in the
vanguard of civilization. By such
men it counts the milestones in its
course, and no trick of organization,
no urging of the printing-press, no
subsidy of students, can be made to
take their place.
A final word as to the practical side
of advanced research. Mr. Carnegie
once ascribed the foundation of his
great fortune to the fact that lie first
employed trained chemists where
other manufacturers chose workmen
skilled in making steel by rule of
thumb. His chemists were able to
suggest improvements. They de
vised ways of making better steel
cheaper still, and at the same time of
utilizing the refuse or slag
In the future the success of each
great enterprise must depend on the
improvements it makes. The nation
successful in manufacture and com
merce will be the one richest in labor
aiding devices. All these must de
' pend on the advancement of knowl

edge. Pure science must precede
applied science.
Once the manufacturer or the na
tion could hire its chemists as it needed
them. The few asked for were al
ready made. Now they must make
them. The advancement of any
branch of science depends 011 the
mastery of what is known before.
Everything easy and everything in
expensive has been found out. To
train the chemist of the future we
need constantly finer instruments of
precision for his advanced work, ac
cess to greater and greater libraries
that he may know what is already
done, for each generation of scientific
workers must stand on the shoulders
of those gone before, else it can make
110 progress beyond them. The
scholars of today would be helpless
were it not that they can save time
by drawing freely on the accumulated
knowledge of the past.
To learn the elements of any science
costs little. It can be learned at one
end of a log with a great teacher on
the other. It can be even learned
without a teacher. But to master a
science so as to extend its boundaries
—this is quite another thing. More
than a man can earn in a lifetime it
costs to make a start. For this rea
son a university which provides means
for such work is a very costly estab
lishment. For this reason the inves
tigator of the future must depend on
the university. The nation with
the best equipped universities will
furnished the best-trained men. On
the universities the progress in man
ufactures and commerce must depend.
Through the superiority of training
Germany is passing England in the
commercial world in spite of her
handicaps of position and history.
Through the excellence of her uni
versities, without most of these hand
icaps, America is likely to excel both
Germany and England.
As men of science are needed,they
cannot make themselves. Those with
power can help them. This fact has
given the impulse to the far-reaching
gifts of Stanford, Rockefeller, Carne
gie, and Rhodes. These are not gifts
but investments put to the credit of
the country's future. The people,
too, have power to give. The
same feeling of investment has
led them to build their state
universities, and to entrust to
them not only the work of per
sonal culture, but of advancement in
literature, science, and arts. With
general culture and professional train
ing must go the advancement of
knowledge, the progress of society,
through the advancement of the wis
dom and the power of man.
The roll of the Alumni of our Uni
versity now numbers more than 1600
names. Men and women of Stan
ford, they are scattered far and wide
over the whole earth, and in their
various ways each one is doing honor
to the training in effectiveness and
character given them by their Alma
Mater. The roll is a roll of honor,
and to this list today as youth of
promise, young men and young
women of the Republic, the Leland
Stanford Junior University is glad
and proud to add your names as well,
confident that in the days to come
your Alma Mater shall be glad and
proud to say, " These too are my
children."
With the end of our Republic's first
century we had the first clear vision
of the greatest of republican institu
tions the American university. It
was even then only a vision. It is not
yet realized, but we know something
of what it is to be. Out of the strug
gles and the prayers, the hopes and the
efforts of good men and good women,
wesee it taking form. A university as
fair as those which England has
known fora thousand years, as sound
and as strong as the deep-rooted
schools of Germany, with something
of both, yet different from either, is
the coining University of America.
There will be many of these institu
tions, for our land is very wide, and
they will differ from each other some
what in kind, and as one star differ
eth from another in glory, still of the
same general pattern all must be. They
will be schools for training American
boys and girls to be American men and
women. They will express the loftiest
ideals of higher education within our
great democracy. One of this great
sisterhood of universities our own
Stanford must become, hence it is fit
ting for us, from time to time, to con
sider the present, and to forecast the
future.
The American college, as it existed
thirty years ago and more, and as it
still exists in some quarters, is dis
tinctly a school for personal culture.
Its strongest agency has been the
personal influence of devoted men. It
has made no effort to give profes
sional training. It has made no pre
tense of leading in scientific research.
A log with Mark Hopkins at one end
of it and himself at the other was
Garfield's conception of such a col
lege. Even the log is not essential.
The earnest teacher is all in all. Ap
paratus Mark Hopkins did not need,
books he even despised. The medium
of a forgotten language and an out
worn philosophy served him as well
as anything else in impressing on his
boys the stamp of his own character.
It was said of Dr. Nott of Union Col
lege that "He took the sweepings of
other colleges and sent them back to
society pure gold." Such was his
personal influence on young men.
A notable example of the college
spirit was Arnold of Rugby. Another
was Jowett, Master of Baliol. A
teacher of this type, in greater or less
degree, it was the privilege of every
college student to know, and this
knowledge still reconciles him to his
alma mater, however many her
shortcomings in subject or method.
Hut times have changed since the
days of Mark Hopkins. The Ameri
can college —Knglish born and Eng

lish in tradition—under the touch of
German influences, and in response
to actual needs, is changing to the
American university. It is no longer
a school of culture alone, a school of
personal growth through personal ex
ample. It is becoming, in addition
to this, a school of research, a school
of power. It stands in the advance
guard of civilization, responsive not
to the truth of tradition alone but to
the new truth daily and hourly re
vealed in the experience of man.
In the movement of events the
American university unites in itself
three different functions: that of the
college, that of the professional school,
and that which is distinctive of the
university.
The college is now, as ever, a school
of culture. It aims to make wise,
sane, well-rounded men who know
something of the best that men have
thought and done in this world, and
whose lives will be the better for this
knowledge. It has not discarded the
Latin, Greek, and Mathematics which
were so long the chief agents in cul
ture, but it has greatly added to this
list. It has found that to some minds,
at least, better results arise from the
study of other things. Culture is born
from mastery. The mind is strength
ened by what it can assimilate. It
can use only that which relates itself
to life. We find that Greek-minded
ness is necessary to receive from the
Greek all that this noblest of lan
guages is competent to give. We
find for the average man better educa
tional substance in English than in
Latin, in the Physical or Natural
Sciences than in the Calculus. Hut
more important than this, we find
that it is safe in the main to trust the
choice of studies to the student him
self. The very fact of choice is in
itself an education. It is better to
choose wrong, sometimes, as we do
a hundred times in life, than to be
arbitrarily directed to the best selec
tion. Moreover, so far as culture is
concerned, the best teacher is more
important than the best study. It is
still true, as Emerson once wrote to
his daughter, that "It matters little
what your studies are; it all lies in
who your teacher is." A large insti
tution has many students. It has
likewise many teachers, and an Ar
nold or a Hopkins, a Warner or a
Thoburn, can come just as close to
the students' hearts in a large school
as in a small one. But "the know
ing of men by name," the care for
their personal lives and characters,
must be the essential element in the
new college course as it was in the
old. And the college function of the
university must not be despised or
belittled. Because Germany has no
colleges, because her students go di
rectly from the high school at home
to the professional school or the uni
versity, some have urged the aban
donment by the American university
of this primal function of general cul
ture. In their eagerness to develop
the advanced work some institutions
have relegated the college function
almost solely to tutors without exper
ience, and have left it without stand
ards and without serious purpose. It
is not right that even the Freshmen
should be poorly taught. On the
soundness of the college training
everything else must depend. In the
long run the greatest university will
be the one that devotes the most care
to its undergraduates. With the col
lege graduation higher education in
England mostly stops. With Ger
many here the higher education he
gins. Higher education has been de
fined as that training which demands
that a man should leave home. It
means a breaking of the leading
strings. It means the entrance to
another atmosphere. The high school
and the gymnasium cannot have the
academic atmosphere, however ad
vanced their studies may be. They
must reflect the spirit of the town
which supports them, and of which
they are necessarily a part. They
cannot be free in the sense in which
the universities are free. A boy who
lives at home in a city, and goes back
and forth on a train, cannot be a uni
versity student. He may recite in
the university classes, but there his
relation ends. He gets little of the
spirit which moves outside of the class
room. He cannot enter the univer
sity until he breathes the university
atmosphere. The "Spurstudenten,"
or "railway students," those who
come and go on the trains, are right
ly held by their fellows in Germany
to be little more than Philistines.
Whatever the other excellencies of
the German system, the gymnasium,
or advanced high school, is an inade
quate substitute for the American col
lege.
The second function of the univer
sity is that of professional training.
To the man once in the path of cul
ture this school adds effectiveness in
his chosen calling. This work the
American universities have taken up
slowly and grudgingly. The demand
for instruction in law and medicine
has been met weakly but extensively
by private enterprise. The schools
thus founded have been dependent
on the students' fees, and on the ad
vertising gain their teachers receive
through connection with them. Such
schools as these stand no comparison
with the professional schools of Ger
many. Their foundation is precari
ous, they cannot demand high stand
ards, nor look beyond present neces
sities to the future of professional
training. Only a few of our profes
sional schools today demand univer
sity standards. Those who do not
cannot share the university spirit.
They have no part in university
development. Only in the degree
that they are part and parcel of
the university do they in general
deserve to live. The first pro
fession to become thus allied is
that of engineering, thanks to the
wisdom that directed the Morrill Act.
Following this, law, medicine, theol
ogy, education, have in some quar
ters, taken a university basis, and the
few professional schools in which such
a basis exists rank fairly with the best
of their class in the world.
Thecrowningfunction ofa university
is that of original research. On this
rests the advance of civilization. From
the application of scientific knowledge
most of the successes of the Nine
teenth Century have arisen. It is the
first era of science. Behind the ap
plication of such knowledge rests the
acquisition of it. One Helmholtz, the
investigator, is the parent of a thou
sand Edisons, the adapters of the
knowledge gained by others. The
great function of the German
university is that of instruction
through investigation. The stu
dent begins his work on a narrow
space at the outer rim of knowledge.
It is his duty to carry the solid
ground a little farther, to drive back
ever so little it may be the darkness
of ignorance and mystery. The real

university is a school of research.
That we possess the university spirit
is our only excuse that we adopt the
university name. A true university
is not a collection of colleges. It is
not a college with an outer fringe of
professional schools. It is not a clus
ter of professional schools. It is the
association of scholars. It is the insti
tution from which in every direction
blazes the light of original research.
Its choicest product is "that fanati
cism for veracity," as Huxley calls
it, that love for truth, without which
man is but the toy of the elements.
Its spirit is the desire "to know
things as they really are," which is
the necessary attribute of "him that
overcometh." No institution can be
college, professional school, and uni
versity all in one, and exercise all
these functions fully in the four years
which form the traditional college
course. To attempt it is to fail in
one way or another. We do at
tempt it and we do fail. In the engi
neering courses of today we try to
combine in four years professional
training with research and culture.
This cannot be done, for while the
professional work is reasonably com
plete, culture is at a minimum, and
research crowded to the wall. The
subject of law requires three solid
years for professional training alone.
Three or four culture years go with this,
and are surely none too many. The
same requirement must soon be made
in Engineering. We cannot make an
engineer in four years if we do any
thing else for him, and there are very
many things besides engineering
which go to the making of a real
engineer.
Hut this we can do in the four years
of college culture: We can show the
student the line of his professional
advancement, and can see him well
started in its direction before he has
taken his first degree. We can give
in the college course something of
the methods and results of advanced
research. In any subject the ad
vanced work has a higher culture
value than elementary work. Thor
ough study of one subject is more
helpful than superficial knowledge of
half a dozen. To know one thing
well is, in Agassiz's words, "to have
the backbone of culture." By limit
ing the range of individual training to
a few things done thoroughly it is
possible to give even to the under
graduate some touch of real univer
sity method, some knowledge of how
truth is won. To accomplish this is
one vital part of the university's duty.
It welds together the three functions
of a university, and in so doing it will
give the American university its most
characteristic feature.
The best education for any man
with brains and character should in
volve these three elements:
It should have the final goal in
view as soon as possible.
It should be broad enough and
thorough enough to develop cultured
manhood, and at the same time to
furnish the strength needed to reach
this goal. In other words, it should
look to success in the profession and
to success as a man. Toward both
these ends the methods of finding the
truth for one's self are vitally essential.
The university should disclose the
secret of power, and this secret lies in
thoroughness. Science is human
experience tested and set in order.
The advance of science has come
through the use of instruments of
precision and methods of precision.
Opinion, feeling, tradition, plausibil
ity, illusions of whatever sort, disap
pear when the method of power is
once mastered.
The college course should have a

little of the professional spirit for its
guidance, a little of the university
spirit for its inspiration; the best in
terests of all three will keep them in
the closest relation to each other. At
the same they must not starve each
other. At the present time the needs
of the college in most cases tend to
dwarf the more costly functions of the
university. The professors have their
hands full of lower work. The books
and material the university work de
mand are far more costly than the
college can afford. The trustees still
too often regard the graduate school
as an expensive alien, and its de
mands in most quarters still receive
scant attention. To train fifty inves
tigators costs more than to give a
thousand men a college education.
The sciences cost more than the hu
manities, and the applied sciences,
with their vast and changing array of
machinery, are most expensive of all.
Equally unwise, it seems to me,
though less common, is the disposi
tion to slight the college course for
the sake of advanced research. Poor
work, wherever done, leaves its mark
of poverty. The great university of
the future will be the one which does
well whatever it undertakes, be it
high or low. Better have few de
partments, very few, than that any
should be weak and paltry. Better
few students well taught than many
neglected.
It is fair to judge a university by
the character of its advanced work.
Institutions cannot be graded by the
number in attendance. This is the
most frequent and most vulgar gauge
of relative standing. The rank of an
institution is determined no more by
the number of its students than by
the number of trees on its campus.
W r hat sort of men does it have, and
what are they doing ? These are the
living questions. Buildings are conven
ient; beautiful buildings have a great
culture value. We should be the last
to under-rate the effect of the charm
of cloisters and towers, of circles of
palms and sweet-toned bells. But
these do not make a university.
Books are useful, they are vital to re
search, but wiser men than we have
ever known have grown up without
books. Shakspere had few of them,
Lincoln but few, Homer and Jesus
none at all. Books serve no purpose
if they are not used. The man who
reads it gives the book its life.
Specimens are inevitable in natural
history. Apparatus is necessary in
physical science. Collections and
equipment are really the outgrowth
of the men that use them. You can
not order them in advance. Pro
fessor Haeckel once said, bitterly,
that the results of research in the
great laboratories was in inverse
proportion to the perfection of their
appliances. An investigation may be
lost in multiplicity of details, or in
elaboration of preparation. Some
men will spend years in getting a
microscope or a microtome just right
and then never use it. It is said
that the entire outfit of Joseph Leidy,
one of the greatest of our microsco
pists, cost just seventy-five dollars.
It was the man and not the equip
ment that made his investigations
luminous.
Publication is necessary, but it
would be the greatest of mistakes to
measure a university by the number
of pages printed by its members.
Much of the so-called research, even
in Germany, is unworthy of the name
of science. Its subject matter is not
extension of human experience, but
the addition to human pedantry. To
count the twists and turns of literary
eccentricity may have no more intel
lectual significance than to count the
dead leaves in the forest. Statistical
work is justified not by the labor it
requires, but by the laws it unveils.
Elaboration of method may conceal
the dearth of purpose. Moreover, it
is easier to string the web of plausi
bility than to recover the lost clue ol
truth. Of a thousand doctors' theses
each year, scarcely one in a hun
dred contains a real addition to
knowledge. When it does it
may be that the hand of the
master placed it there. In too many
cases a piece of research is simply a
bid for notice. American universi
ties are always 011 the watch for men
who can do something as it should
be done. Work is often done solely
to arrest the attention of the univer
sity authorities. A professorship once
gained, nothing more is heard of re

itch for writing often passes for the
power of original research. The fan
aticism for veracity has nothing in
common with versatile writing or
paradoxical cleverness. It took Dar
win twenty-five years of the severest
work before he could get his own
leave to print his own conclusions.
Other writers put forth sweeping gen
eralizations as rapidly as their type
writers can take them from dictation.
In certain works which have arrested
popular attention, the investigations
must have gone on at the highest
speed attainable by the pen of the
gifted author. Such work justifies
Fechner's sarcastic phrase, "Cuckoo's
eggs laid in the nest of science."
The work of science is addressed

generations pass before another inves
tigator takes up the thread. The
science of the newspapers is of quite
another type, and so is much of the
science of just now famous men from
whom newspaper science derives its
inspiration.
While the university on its human
side is interested in all that touches
the life of today, on the scientific side
it deals with the eternal verities, and
cares nothing for those things which
are merely local or timely.
The University must conduct re
search to ends of power. This it has
hardly begun to do in America. Half
our graduate students are not ready

a real university. The graduate de

be the noblest—where noble men

'' The merit of a university depends
on the men who are called to conduct

have such auxiliaries as books and in
struments —books are nothing but
paper and ink until they are read,
and instruments but brass and glass
until craft and skill are applied to
their handling."
But it is in its men that the real
university has its real being. Through
the work of such men it stands in the
vanguard of civilization. By such
men it counts the milestones in its
course, and no trick of organization,
no urging of the printing-press, no
subsidy of students, can be made to
take their place.
A final word as to the practical side
of advanced research. Mr. Carnegie
once ascribed the foundation of his
great fortune to the fact that lie first
employed trained chemists where
other manufacturers chose workmen
skilled in making steel by rule of
thumb. His chemists were able to
suggest improvements. They de
vised ways of making better steel
cheaper still, and at the same time of
utilizing the refuse or slag
In the future the success of each
great enterprise must depend on the
improvements it makes. The nation
successful in manufacture and com
merce will be the one richest in labor
aiding devices. All these must de
' pend on the advancement of knowl

edge. Pure science must precede
applied science.
Once the manufacturer or the na
tion could hire its chemists as it needed
them. The few asked for were al
ready made. Now they must make
them. The advancement of any
branch of science depends 011 the
mastery of what is known before.
Everything easy and everything in
expensive has been found out. To
train the chemist of the future we
need constantly finer instruments of
precision for his advanced work, ac
cess to greater and greater libraries
that he may know what is already
done, for each generation of scientific
workers must stand on the shoulders
of those gone before, else it can make
110 progress beyond them. The
scholars of today would be helpless
were it not that they can save time
by drawing freely on the accumulated
knowledge of the past.
To learn the elements of any science
costs little. It can be learned at one
end of a log with a great teacher on
the other. It can be even learned
without a teacher. But to master a
science so as to extend its boundaries
—this is quite another thing. More
than a man can earn in a lifetime it
costs to make a start. For this rea
son a university which provides means
for such work is a very costly estab
lishment. For this reason the inves
tigator of the future must depend on
the university. The nation with
the best equipped universities will
furnished the best-trained men. On
the universities the progress in man
ufactures and commerce must depend.
Through the superiority of training
Germany is passing England in the
commercial world in spite of her
handicaps of position and history.
Through the excellence of her uni
versities, without most of these hand
icaps, America is likely to excel both
Germany and England.
As men of science are needed,they
cannot make themselves. Those with
power can help them. This fact has
given the impulse to the far-reaching
gifts of Stanford, Rockefeller, Carne
gie, and Rhodes. These are not gifts
but investments put to the credit of
the country's future. The people,
too, have power to give. The
same feeling of investment has
led them to build their state
universities, and to entrust to
them not only the work of per
sonal culture, but of advancement in
literature, science, and arts. With
general culture and professional train
ing must go the advancement of
knowledge, the progress of society,
through the advancement of the wis
dom and the power of man.
The roll of the Alumni of our Uni
versity now numbers more than 1600
names. Men and women of Stan
ford, they are scattered far and wide
over the whole earth, and in their
various ways each one is doing honor
to the training in effectiveness and
character given them by their Alma
Mater. The roll is a roll of honor,
and to this list today as youth of
promise, young men and young
women of the Republic, the Leland
Stanford Junior University is glad
and proud to add your names as well,
confident that in the days to come
your Alma Mater shall be glad and
proud to say, " These too are my
children."
With the end of our Republic's first
century we had the first clear vision
of the greatest of republican institu
tions the American university. It
was even then only a vision. It is not
yet realized, but we know something
of what it is to be. Out of the strug
gles and the prayers, the hopes and the
efforts of good men and good women,
wesee it taking form. A university as
fair as those which England has
known fora thousand years, as sound
and as strong as the deep-rooted
schools of Germany, with something
of both, yet different from either, is
the coining University of America.
There will be many of these institu
tions, for our land is very wide, and
they will differ from each other some
what in kind, and as one star differ
eth from another in glory, still of the
same general pattern all must be. They
will be schools for training American
boys and girls to be American men and
women. They will express the loftiest
ideals of higher education within our
great democracy. One of this great
sisterhood of universities our own
Stanford must become, hence it is fit
ting for us, from time to time, to con
sider the present, and to forecast the
future.
The American college, as it existed
thirty years ago and more, and as it
still exists in some quarters, is dis
tinctly a school for personal culture.
Its strongest agency has been the
personal influence of devoted men. It
has made no effort to give profes
sional training. It has made no pre
tense of leading in scientific research.
A log with Mark Hopkins at one end
of it and himself at the other was
Garfield's conception of such a col
lege. Even the log is not essential.
The earnest teacher is all in all. Ap
paratus Mark Hopkins did not need,
books he even despised. The medium
of a forgotten language and an out
worn philosophy served him as well
as anything else in impressing on his
boys the stamp of his own character.
It was said of Dr. Nott of Union Col
lege that "He took the sweepings of
other colleges and sent them back to
society pure gold." Such was his
personal influence on young men.
A notable example of the college
spirit was Arnold of Rugby. Another
was Jowett, Master of Baliol. A
teacher of this type, in greater or less
degree, it was the privilege of every
college student to know, and this
knowledge still reconciles him to his
alma mater, however many her
shortcomings in subject or method.
Hut times have changed since the
days of Mark Hopkins. The Ameri
can college —Knglish born and Eng

lish in tradition—under the touch of
German influences, and in response
to actual needs, is changing to the
American university. It is no longer
a school of culture alone, a school of
personal growth through personal ex
ample. It is becoming, in addition
to this, a school of research, a school
of power. It stands in the advance
guard of civilization, responsive not
to the truth of tradition alone but to
the new truth daily and hourly re
vealed in the experience of man.
In the movement of events the
American university unites in itself
three different functions: that of the
college, that of the professional school,
and that which is distinctive of the
university.
The college is now, as ever, a school
of culture. It aims to make wise,
sane, well-rounded men who know
something of the best that men have
thought and done in this world, and
whose lives will be the better for this
knowledge. It has not discarded the
Latin, Greek, and Mathematics which
were so long the chief agents in cul
ture, but it has greatly added to this
list. It has found that to some minds,
at least, better results arise from the
study of other things. Culture is born
from mastery. The mind is strength
ened by what it can assimilate. It
can use only that which relates itself
to life. We find that Greek-minded
ness is necessary to receive from the
Greek all that this noblest of lan
guages is competent to give. We
find for the average man better educa
tional substance in English than in
Latin, in the Physical or Natural
Sciences than in the Calculus. Hut
more important than this, we find
that it is safe in the main to trust the
choice of studies to the student him
self. The very fact of choice is in
itself an education. It is better to
choose wrong, sometimes, as we do
a hundred times in life, than to be
arbitrarily directed to the best selec
tion. Moreover, so far as culture is
concerned, the best teacher is more
important than the best study. It is
still true, as Emerson once wrote to
his daughter, that "It matters little
what your studies are; it all lies in
who your teacher is." A large insti
tution has many students. It has
likewise many teachers, and an Ar
nold or a Hopkins, a Warner or a
Thoburn, can come just as close to
the students' hearts in a large school
as in a small one. But "the know
ing of men by name," the care for
their personal lives and characters,
must be the essential element in the
new college course as it was in the
old. And the college function of the
university must not be despised or
belittled. Because Germany has no
colleges, because her students go di
rectly from the high school at home
to the professional school or the uni
versity, some have urged the aban
donment by the American university
of this primal function of general cul
ture. In their eagerness to develop
the advanced work some institutions
have relegated the college function
almost solely to tutors without exper
ience, and have left it without stand
ards and without serious purpose. It
is not right that even the Freshmen
should be poorly taught. On the
soundness of the college training
everything else must depend. In the
long run the greatest university will
be the one that devotes the most care
to its undergraduates. With the col
lege graduation higher education in
England mostly stops. With Ger
many here the higher education he
gins. Higher education has been de
fined as that training which demands
that a man should leave home. It
means a breaking of the leading
strings. It means the entrance to
another atmosphere. The high school
and the gymnasium cannot have the
academic atmosphere, however ad
vanced their studies may be. They
must reflect the spirit of the town
which supports them, and of which
they are necessarily a part. They
cannot be free in the sense in which
the universities are free. A boy who
lives at home in a city, and goes back
and forth on a train, cannot be a uni
versity student. He may recite in
the university classes, but there his
relation ends. He gets little of the
spirit which moves outside of the class
room. He cannot enter the univer
sity until he breathes the university
atmosphere. The "Spurstudenten,"
or "railway students," those who
come and go on the trains, are right
ly held by their fellows in Germany
to be little more than Philistines.
Whatever the other excellencies of
the German system, the gymnasium,
or advanced high school, is an inade
quate substitute for the American col
lege.
The second function of the univer
sity is that of professional training.
To the man once in the path of cul
ture this school adds effectiveness in
his chosen calling. This work the
American universities have taken up
slowly and grudgingly. The demand
for instruction in law and medicine
has been met weakly but extensively
by private enterprise. The schools
thus founded have been dependent
on the students' fees, and on the ad
vertising gain their teachers receive
through connection with them. Such
schools as these stand no comparison
with the professional schools of Ger
many. Their foundation is precari
ous, they cannot demand high stand
ards, nor look beyond present neces
sities to the future of professional
training. Only a few of our profes
sional schools today demand univer
sity standards. Those who do not
cannot share the university spirit.
They have no part in university
development. Only in the degree
that they are part and parcel of
the university do they in general
deserve to live. The first pro
fession to become thus allied is
that of engineering, thanks to the
wisdom that directed the Morrill Act.
Following this, law, medicine, theol
ogy, education, have in some quar
ters, taken a university basis, and the
few professional schools in which such
a basis exists rank fairly with the best
of their class in the world.
Thecrowningfunction ofa university
is that of original research. On this
rests the advance of civilization. From
the application of scientific knowledge
most of the successes of the Nine
teenth Century have arisen. It is the
first era of science. Behind the ap
plication of such knowledge rests the
acquisition of it. One Helmholtz, the
investigator, is the parent of a thou
sand Edisons, the adapters of the
knowledge gained by others. The
great function of the German
university is that of instruction
through investigation. The stu
dent begins his work on a narrow
space at the outer rim of knowledge.
It is his duty to carry the solid
ground a little farther, to drive back
ever so little it may be the darkness
of ignorance and mystery. The real

university is a school of research.
That we possess the university spirit
is our only excuse that we adopt the
university name. A true university
is not a collection of colleges. It is
not a college with an outer fringe of
professional schools. It is not a clus
ter of professional schools. It is the
association of scholars. It is the insti
tution from which in every direction
blazes the light of original research.
Its choicest product is "that fanati
cism for veracity," as Huxley calls
it, that love for truth, without which
man is but the toy of the elements.
Its spirit is the desire "to know
things as they really are," which is
the necessary attribute of "him that
overcometh." No institution can be
college, professional school, and uni
versity all in one, and exercise all
these functions fully in the four years
which form the traditional college
course. To attempt it is to fail in
one way or another. We do at
tempt it and we do fail. In the engi
neering courses of today we try to
combine in four years professional
training with research and culture.
This cannot be done, for while the
professional work is reasonably com
plete, culture is at a minimum, and
research crowded to the wall. The
subject of law requires three solid
years for professional training alone.
Three or four culture years go with this,
and are surely none too many. The
same requirement must soon be made
in Engineering. We cannot make an
engineer in four years if we do any
thing else for him, and there are very
many things besides engineering
which go to the making of a real
engineer.
Hut this we can do in the four years
of college culture: We can show the
student the line of his professional
advancement, and can see him well
started in its direction before he has
taken his first degree. We can give
in the college course something of
the methods and results of advanced
research. In any subject the ad
vanced work has a higher culture
value than elementary work. Thor
ough study of one subject is more
helpful than superficial knowledge of
half a dozen. To know one thing
well is, in Agassiz's words, "to have
the backbone of culture." By limit
ing the range of individual training to
a few things done thoroughly it is
possible to give even to the under
graduate some touch of real univer
sity method, some knowledge of how
truth is won. To accomplish this is
one vital part of the university's duty.
It welds together the three functions
of a university, and in so doing it will
give the American university its most
characteristic feature.
The best education for any man
with brains and character should in
volve these three elements:
It should have the final goal in
view as soon as possible.
It should be broad enough and
thorough enough to develop cultured
manhood, and at the same time to
furnish the strength needed to reach
this goal. In other words, it should
look to success in the profession and
to success as a man. Toward both
these ends the methods of finding the
truth for one's self are vitally essential.
The university should disclose the
secret of power, and this secret lies in
thoroughness. Science is human
experience tested and set in order.
The advance of science has come
through the use of instruments of
precision and methods of precision.
Opinion, feeling, tradition, plausibil
ity, illusions of whatever sort, disap
pear when the method of power is
once mastered.
The college course should have a

little of the professional spirit for its
guidance, a little of the university
spirit for its inspiration; the best in
terests of all three will keep them in
the closest relation to each other. At
the same they must not starve each
other. At the present time the needs
of the college in most cases tend to
dwarf the more costly functions of the
university. The professors have their
hands full of lower work. The books
and material the university work de
mand are far more costly than the
college can afford. The trustees still
too often regard the graduate school
as an expensive alien, and its de
mands in most quarters still receive
scant attention. To train fifty inves
tigators costs more than to give a
thousand men a college education.
The sciences cost more than the hu
manities, and the applied sciences,
with their vast and changing array of
machinery, are most expensive of all.
Equally unwise, it seems to me,
though less common, is the disposi
tion to slight the college course for
the sake of advanced research. Poor
work, wherever done, leaves its mark
of poverty. The great university of
the future will be the one which does
well whatever it undertakes, be it
high or low. Better have few de
partments, very few, than that any
should be weak and paltry. Better
few students well taught than many
neglected.
It is fair to judge a university by
the character of its advanced work.
Institutions cannot be graded by the
number in attendance. This is the
most frequent and most vulgar gauge
of relative standing. The rank of an
institution is determined no more by
the number of its students than by
the number of trees on its campus.
W r hat sort of men does it have, and
what are they doing ? These are the
living questions. Buildings are conven
ient; beautiful buildings have a great
culture value. We should be the last
to under-rate the effect of the charm
of cloisters and towers, of circles of
palms and sweet-toned bells. But
these do not make a university.
Books are useful, they are vital to re
search, but wiser men than we have
ever known have grown up without
books. Shakspere had few of them,
Lincoln but few, Homer and Jesus
none at all. Books serve no purpose
if they are not used. The man who
reads it gives the book its life.
Specimens are inevitable in natural
history. Apparatus is necessary in
physical science. Collections and
equipment are really the outgrowth
of the men that use them. You can
not order them in advance. Pro
fessor Haeckel once said, bitterly,
that the results of research in the
great laboratories was in inverse
proportion to the perfection of their
appliances. An investigation may be
lost in multiplicity of details, or in
elaboration of preparation. Some
men will spend years in getting a
microscope or a microtome just right
and then never use it. It is said
that the entire outfit of Joseph Leidy,
one of the greatest of our microsco
pists, cost just seventy-five dollars.
It was the man and not the equip
ment that made his investigations
luminous.
Publication is necessary, but it
would be the greatest of mistakes to
measure a university by the number
of pages printed by its members.
Much of the so-called research, even
in Germany, is unworthy of the name
of science. Its subject matter is not
extension of human experience, but
the addition to human pedantry. To
count the twists and turns of literary
eccentricity may have no more intel
lectual significance than to count the
dead leaves in the forest. Statistical
work is justified not by the labor it
requires, but by the laws it unveils.
Elaboration of method may conceal
the dearth of purpose. Moreover, it
is easier to string the web of plausi
bility than to recover the lost clue ol
truth. Of a thousand doctors' theses
each year, scarcely one in a hun
dred contains a real addition to
knowledge. When it does it
may be that the hand of the
master placed it there. In too many
cases a piece of research is simply a
bid for notice. American universi
ties are always 011 the watch for men
who can do something as it should
be done. Work is often done solely
to arrest the attention of the univer
sity authorities. A professorship once
gained, nothing more is heard of re
search. The love of novelty with the
itch for writing often passes for the
power of original research. The fan
aticism for veracity has nothing in
common with versatile writing or
paradoxical cleverness. It took Dar
win twenty-five years of the severest
work before he could get his own
leave to print his own conclusions.
Other writers put forth sweeping gen
eralizations as rapidly as their type
writers can take them from dictation.
In certain works which have arrested
popular attention, the investigations
must have gone on at the highest
speed attainable by the pen of the
gifted author. Such work justifies
Fechner's sarcastic phrase, "Cuckoo's
eggs laid in the nest of science."
The work of science is addressed
to science, no matter if half a dozen
generations pass before another inves
tigator takes up the thread. The
science of the newspapers is of quite
another type, and so is much of the
science of just now famous men from
whom newspaper science derives its
inspiration.
While the university on its human
side is interested in all that touches
the life of today, on the scientific side
it deals with the eternal verities, and
cares nothing for those things which
are merely local or timely.
The University must conduct re
search to ends of power. This it has
hardly begun to do in America. Half
our graduate students are not ready
for anything to be called investiga
tion. They are not real students of
a real university. The graduate de
partments of our universities are now
engaged almost exclusively in train
ing teachers. That profession may
be the noblest—where noble men
make it so, but it is only one of many
in which success must rest on orig
inal investigation. We are proud of
our crop of Doctors of Philosophy,
dozens or hundreds turned out
every year. But most of them
are trained only toteach, and we
know that half of them are pre
destined to failure as college teach
ers. We must broaden our work
and widen our sympathies. We must
train men in the higher effectiveness
in every walk in life, men of business
as well as college instructors, states
men as well as linguists, and ship
builders as well as mathematicians,
men of action as well as men of
thought. This means a great deal
more than annual crops of Doctors of
Philosophy to scramble for the few
dozen vacant instructorships open
year by year. But with all these dis
couragements original research is the
loftiest function of the university.
In its consummate excellence is found
the motive for its imitation.
There is but one way in which a
university can discharge this function.
It cannot give prizes for research. It
cannot stimulate it by means of pub

lication, still less by hiring men to
come to its walls to pursue it. The
whole system of fellowships for ad
vanced students is on trial, with most
of the evidence against it. The students
paid to study are not the ones who do
the work. When they are such, they
would have done the work unpaid.
The fellowship system tends to turn
science into almsgiving, to make the
promising youth feel that the world
owes him a living.
All these plans of university build
and others, have been fairly
tried in America. There is but
one that succeeds. Those who
do original work will train oth
ers to do it. Where the teachers are
themselves original investigators de
voted to truth and skilful in the
search for it—men that cannot be
frightened, fatigued, or discouraged
—they will have students like them
selves. To work under such men
students like-minded will come from
the ends of the earth. It is the part of
the investigators to make the univer
sity,as the teachers makes the college.
There never was a genuine univer
sity on any other terms. It is not
conceivable that there should ever be
one. It is not necessary that all de
partments should be equal to make
the university real. It was enough
at Harvard to have Agassiz and Gray,
Lowell, Goodwin, and Holmes, to
justify the name of university. Silli
man and Dana made a university of
Yale. Such men are as rare as they
are choice, and no university faculty
was ever yet composed of them alone,
and none ever yet had too many of
them. President Gilman has wisely
said:
" In the conduct of a university se
cure the ablest men as professors,
regardless of all other qualifications,
excepting those of personal merit and
adaptation to the chairs that are to
be filled. Borrow if you cannot en
list. Give them freedom. Give them
auxiliaries. Give them liberal sup
port. Encourage them to come be
fore the world of science and of let
ters with their publications. Bright
students, soon to be men of distinc
tion, will be their loyal followers, and
the world will say Amen.
'' The merit of a university depends
on the men who are called to conduct
it, upon them absolutely if not exclu
sively; for although the teacher must
have such auxiliaries as books and in
struments —books are nothing but
paper and ink until they are read,
and instruments but brass and glass
until craft and skill are applied to
their handling."
But it is in its men that the real
university has its real being. Through
the work of such men it stands in the
vanguard of civilization. By such
men it counts the milestones in its
course, and no trick of organization,
no urging of the printing-press, no
subsidy of students, can be made to
take their place.
A final word as to the practical side
of advanced research. Mr. Carnegie
once ascribed the foundation of his
great fortune to the fact that lie first
employed trained chemists where
other manufacturers chose workmen
skilled in making steel by rule of
thumb. His chemists were able to
suggest improvements. They de
vised ways of making better steel

In the future the success of each
great enterprise must depend on the
improvements it makes. The nation
successful in manufacture and com
merce will be the one richest in labor
aiding devices. All these must de
' pend on the advancement of knowl

edge. Pure science must precede
applied science.
Once the manufacturer or the na
tion could hire its chemists as it needed
them. The few asked for were al
ready made. Now they must make
them. The advancement of any
branch of science depends 011 the
mastery of what is known before.
Everything easy and everything in
expensive has been found out. To
train the chemist of the future we
need constantly finer instruments of
precision for his advanced work, ac
cess to greater and greater libraries
that he may know what is already
done, for each generation of scientific
workers must stand on the shoulders
of those gone before, else it can make

The American college, as it existed

still exists in some quarters, is dis
tinctly a school for personal culture.
Its strongest agency has been the
personal influence of devoted men. It
has made no effort to give profes
sional training. It has made no pre
tense of leading in scientific research.
A log with Mark Hopkins at one end
of it and himself at the other was
Garfield's conception of such a col
lege. Even the log is not essential.
The earnest teacher is all in all. Ap
paratus Mark Hopkins did not need,
books he even despised. The medium
of a forgotten language and an out
worn philosophy served him as well
as anything else in impressing on his
boys the stamp of his own character.
It was said of Dr. Nott of Union Col
lege that "He took the sweepings of
other colleges and sent them back to
society pure gold." Such was his
personal influence on young men.
A notable example of the college
spirit was Arnold of Rugby. Another
was Jowett, Master of Baliol. A
teacher of this type, in greater or less
degree, it was the privilege of every
college student to know, and this
knowledge still reconciles him to his
alma mater, however many her
shortcomings in subject or method.
Hut times have changed since the
days of Mark Hopkins. The Ameri
can college —Knglish born and Eng

lish in tradition—under the touch of
German influences, and in response
to actual needs, is changing to the
American university. It is no longer
a school of culture alone, a school of
personal growth through personal ex
ample. It is becoming, in addition
to this, a school of research, a school
of power. It stands in the advance
guard of civilization, responsive not
to the truth of tradition alone but to
the new truth daily and hourly re
vealed in the experience of man.
In the movement of events the
American university unites in itself
three different functions: that of the
college, that of the professional school,
and that which is distinctive of the
university.
The college is now, as ever, a school
of culture. It aims to make wise,
sane, well-rounded men who know
something of the best that men have
thought and done in this world, and
whose lives will be the better for this
knowledge. It has not discarded the
Latin, Greek, and Mathematics which
were so long the chief agents in cul
ture, but it has greatly added to this
list. It has found that to some minds,
at least, better results arise from the
study of other things. Culture is born
from mastery. The mind is strength
ened by what it can assimilate. It
can use only that which relates itself
to life. We find that Greek-minded
ness is necessary to receive from the
Greek all that this noblest of lan
guages is competent to give. We
find for the average man better educa
tional substance in English than in
Latin, in the Physical or Natural
Sciences than in the Calculus. Hut
more important than this, we find
that it is safe in the main to trust the
choice of studies to the student him
self. The very fact of choice is in
itself an education. It is better to
choose wrong, sometimes, as we do
a hundred times in life, than to be
arbitrarily directed to the best selec
tion. Moreover, so far as culture is
concerned, the best teacher is more
important than the best study. It is
still true, as Emerson once wrote to
his daughter, that "It matters little
what your studies are; it all lies in
who your teacher is." A large insti
tution has many students. It has
likewise many teachers, and an Ar
nold or a Hopkins, a Warner or a
Thoburn, can come just as close to
the students' hearts in a large school
as in a small one. But "the know
ing of men by name," the care for
their personal lives and characters,
must be the essential element in the
new college course as it was in the
old. And the college function of the
university must not be despised or
belittled. Because Germany has no
colleges, because her students go di
rectly from the high school at home
to the professional school or the uni
versity, some have urged the aban
donment by the American university
of this primal function of general cul
ture. In their eagerness to develop
the advanced work some institutions
have relegated the college function
almost solely to tutors without exper
ience, and have left it without stand
ards and without serious purpose. It
is not right that even the Freshmen
should be poorly taught. On the
soundness of the college training
everything else must depend. In the
long run the greatest university will
be the one that devotes the most care
to its undergraduates. With the col
lege graduation higher education in
England mostly stops. With Ger
many here the higher education he
gins. Higher education has been de
fined as that training which demands
that a man should leave home. It
means a breaking of the leading
strings. It means the entrance to
another atmosphere. The high school
and the gymnasium cannot have the
academic atmosphere, however ad
vanced their studies may be. They
must reflect the spirit of the town
which supports them, and of which
they are necessarily a part. They
cannot be free in the sense in which
the universities are free. A boy who
lives at home in a city, and goes back
and forth on a train, cannot be a uni
versity student. He may recite in
the university classes, but there his
relation ends. He gets little of the
spirit which moves outside of the class
room. He cannot enter the univer
sity until he breathes the university
atmosphere. The "Spurstudenten,"
or "railway students," those who
come and go on the trains, are right
ly held by their fellows in Germany
to be little more than Philistines.
Whatever the other excellencies of
the German system, the gymnasium,
or advanced high school, is an inade
quate substitute for the American col
lege.
The second function of the univer
sity is that of professional training.
To the man once in the path of cul
ture this school adds effectiveness in
his chosen calling. This work the
American universities have taken up
slowly and grudgingly. The demand
for instruction in law and medicine
has been met weakly but extensively
by private enterprise. The schools
thus founded have been dependent
on the students' fees, and on the ad
vertising gain their teachers receive
through connection with them. Such
schools as these stand no comparison
with the professional schools of Ger
many. Their foundation is precari
ous, they cannot demand high stand
ards, nor look beyond present neces
sities to the future of professional
training. Only a few of our profes
sional schools today demand univer
sity standards. Those who do not
cannot share the university spirit.
They have no part in university
development. Only in the degree
that they are part and parcel of
the university do they in general
deserve to live. The first pro
fession to become thus allied is
that of engineering, thanks to the
wisdom that directed the Morrill Act.
Following this, law, medicine, theol
ogy, education, have in some quar
ters, taken a university basis, and the
few professional schools in which such
a basis exists rank fairly with the best
of their class in the world.
Thecrowningfunction ofa university
is that of original research. On this
rests the advance of civilization. From
the application of scientific knowledge
most of the successes of the Nine
teenth Century have arisen. It is the
first era of science. Behind the ap
plication of such knowledge rests the
acquisition of it. One Helmholtz, the
investigator, is the parent of a thou
sand Edisons, the adapters of the
knowledge gained by others. The
great function of the German
university is that of instruction
through investigation. The stu
dent begins his work on a narrow
space at the outer rim of knowledge.
It is his duty to carry the solid
ground a little farther, to drive back
ever so little it may be the darkness
of ignorance and mystery. The real

university is a school of research.
That we possess the university spirit
is our only excuse that we adopt the
university name. A true university
is not a collection of colleges. It is
not a college with an outer fringe of
professional schools. It is not a clus
ter of professional schools. It is the
association of scholars. It is the insti
tution from which in every direction
blazes the light of original research.
Its choicest product is "that fanati
cism for veracity," as Huxley calls
it, that love for truth, without which
man is but the toy of the elements.
Its spirit is the desire "to know
things as they really are," which is
the necessary attribute of "him that
overcometh." No institution can be
college, professional school, and uni
versity all in one, and exercise all
these functions fully in the four years
which form the traditional college
course. To attempt it is to fail in
one way or another. We do at
tempt it and we do fail. In the engi
neering courses of today we try to
combine in four years professional
training with research and culture.
This cannot be done, for while the
professional work is reasonably com
plete, culture is at a minimum, and
research crowded to the wall. The
subject of law requires three solid
years for professional training alone.
Three or four culture years go with this,
and are surely none too many. The
same requirement must soon be made
in Engineering. We cannot make an
engineer in four years if we do any
thing else for him, and there are very
many things besides engineering
which go to the making of a real
engineer.
Hut this we can do in the four years
of college culture: We can show the
student the line of his professional
advancement, and can see him well
started in its direction before he has
taken his first degree. We can give
in the college course something of
the methods and results of advanced
research. In any subject the ad
vanced work has a higher culture
value than elementary work. Thor
ough study of one subject is more
helpful than superficial knowledge of
half a dozen. To know one thing
well is, in Agassiz's words, "to have
the backbone of culture." By limit
ing the range of individual training to
a few things done thoroughly it is
possible to give even to the under
graduate some touch of real univer
sity method, some knowledge of how
truth is won. To accomplish this is
one vital part of the university's duty.
It welds together the three functions
of a university, and in so doing it will
give the American university its most
characteristic feature.
The best education for any man
with brains and character should in
volve these three elements:
It should have the final goal in
view as soon as possible.
It should be broad enough and
thorough enough to develop cultured
manhood, and at the same time to
furnish the strength needed to reach
this goal. In other words, it should
look to success in the profession and
to success as a man. Toward both
these ends the methods of finding the
truth for one's self are vitally essential.
The university should disclose the
secret of power, and this secret lies in
thoroughness. Science is human
experience tested and set in order.
The advance of science has come
through the use of instruments of
precision and methods of precision.
Opinion, feeling, tradition, plausibil
ity, illusions of whatever sort, disap
pear when the method of power is
once mastered.
The college course should have a

little of the professional spirit for its
guidance, a little of the university
spirit for its inspiration; the best in
terests of all three will keep them in
the closest relation to each other. At
the same they must not starve each
other. At the present time the needs
of the college in most cases tend to
dwarf the more costly functions of the
university. The professors have their
hands full of lower work. The books
and material the university work de
mand are far more costly than the
college can afford. The trustees still
too often regard the graduate school
as an expensive alien, and its de
mands in most quarters still receive
scant attention. To train fifty inves
tigators costs more than to give a
thousand men a college education.
The sciences cost more than the hu
manities, and the applied sciences,
with their vast and changing array of
machinery, are most expensive of all.
Equally unwise, it seems to me,
though less common, is the disposi
tion to slight the college course for
the sake of advanced research. Poor
work, wherever done, leaves its mark
of poverty. The great university of
the future will be the one which does
well whatever it undertakes, be it
high or low. Better have few de
partments, very few, than that any
should be weak and paltry. Better
few students well taught than many
neglected.
It is fair to judge a university by
the character of its advanced work.
Institutions cannot be graded by the
number in attendance. This is the
most frequent and most vulgar gauge
of relative standing. The rank of an
institution is determined no more by
the number of its students than by
the number of trees on its campus.
W r hat sort of men does it have, and
what are they doing ? These are the
living questions. Buildings are conven
ient; beautiful buildings have a great
culture value. We should be the last
to under-rate the effect of the charm
of cloisters and towers, of circles of
palms and sweet-toned bells. But
these do not make a university.
Books are useful, they are vital to re
search, but wiser men than we have
ever known have grown up without
books. Shakspere had few of them,
Lincoln but few, Homer and Jesus
none at all. Books serve no purpose
if they are not used. The man who
reads it gives the book its life.
Specimens are inevitable in natural
history. Apparatus is necessary in
physical science. Collections and
equipment are really the outgrowth
of the men that use them. You can
not order them in advance. Pro
fessor Haeckel once said, bitterly,
that the results of research in the
great laboratories was in inverse
proportion to the perfection of their
appliances. An investigation may be
lost in multiplicity of details, or in
elaboration of preparation. Some
men will spend years in getting a
microscope or a microtome just right
and then never use it. It is said
that the entire outfit of Joseph Leidy,
one of the greatest of our microsco
pists, cost just seventy-five dollars.
It was the man and not the equip
ment that made his investigations
luminous.
Publication is necessary, but it
would be the greatest of mistakes to
measure a university by the number
of pages printed by its members.
Much of the so-called research, even
in Germany, is unworthy of the name
of science. Its subject matter is not
extension of human experience, but
the addition to human pedantry. To
count the twists and turns of literary
eccentricity may have no more intel
lectual significance than to count the
dead leaves in the forest. Statistical
work is justified not by the labor it
requires, but by the laws it unveils.
Elaboration of method may conceal
the dearth of purpose. Moreover, it
is easier to string the web of plausi
bility than to recover the lost clue ol
truth. Of a thousand doctors' theses
each year, scarcely one in a hun
dred contains a real addition to
knowledge. When it does it
may be that the hand of the
master placed it there. In too many
cases a piece of research is simply a
bid for notice. American universi
ties are always 011 the watch for men
who can do something as it should
be done. Work is often done solely
to arrest the attention of the univer
sity authorities. A professorship once
gained, nothing more is heard of re
search. The love of novelty with the
itch for writing often passes for the
power of original research. The fan
aticism for veracity has nothing in
common with versatile writing or
paradoxical cleverness. It took Dar
win twenty-five years of the severest
work before he could get his own
leave to print his own conclusions.
Other writers put forth sweeping gen
eralizations as rapidly as their type
writers can take them from dictation.
In certain works which have arrested
popular attention, the investigations
must have gone on at the highest
speed attainable by the pen of the
gifted author. Such work justifies
Fechner's sarcastic phrase, "Cuckoo's
eggs laid in the nest of science."
The work of science is addressed
to science, no matter if half a dozen
generations pass before another inves
tigator takes up the thread. The
science of the newspapers is of quite
another type, and so is much of the
science of just now famous men from
whom newspaper science derives its
inspiration.
While the university on its human
side is interested in all that touches
the life of today, on the scientific side
it deals with the eternal verities, and
cares nothing for those things which
are merely local or timely.
The University must conduct re
search to ends of power. This it has
hardly begun to do in America. Half
our graduate students are not ready
for anything to be called investiga
tion. They are not real students of
a real university. The graduate de
partments of our universities are now
engaged almost exclusively in train
ing teachers. That profession may
be the noblest—where noble men
make it so, but it is only one of many
in which success must rest on orig
inal investigation. We are proud of
our crop of Doctors of Philosophy,
dozens or hundreds turned out
every year. But most of them
are trained only toteach, and we
know that half of them are pre
destined to failure as college teach
ers. We must broaden our work
and widen our sympathies. We must
train men in the higher effectiveness
in every walk in life, men of business
as well as college instructors, states
men as well as linguists, and ship
builders as well as mathematicians,
men of action as well as men of
thought. This means a great deal
more than annual crops of Doctors of
Philosophy to scramble for the few
dozen vacant instructorships open
year by year. But with all these dis
couragements original research is the
loftiest function of the university.
In its consummate excellence is found
the motive for its imitation.
There is but one way in which a
university can discharge this function.
It cannot give prizes for research. It
cannot stimulate it by means of pub

lication, still less by hiring men to
come to its walls to pursue it. The
whole system of fellowships for ad
vanced students is on trial, with most
of the evidence against it. The students
paid to study are not the ones who do
the work. When they are such, they
would have done the work unpaid.
The fellowship system tends to turn
science into almsgiving, to make the
promising youth feel that the world
owes him a living.
All these plans of university build
and others, have been fairly
tried in America. There is but
one that succeeds. Those who
do original work will train oth
ers to do it. Where the teachers are
themselves original investigators de
voted to truth and skilful in the
search for it—men that cannot be
frightened, fatigued, or discouraged
—they will have students like them
selves. To work under such men
students like-minded will come from
the ends of the earth. It is the part of
the investigators to make the univer
sity,as the teachers makes the college.
There never was a genuine univer
sity on any other terms. It is not
conceivable that there should ever be
one. It is not necessary that all de
partments should be equal to make
the university real. It was enough
at Harvard to have Agassiz and Gray,
Lowell, Goodwin, and Holmes, to
justify the name of university. Silli
man and Dana made a university of
Yale. Such men are as rare as they
are choice, and no university faculty
was ever yet composed of them alone,
and none ever yet had too many of
them. President Gilman has wisely
said:
" In the conduct of a university se
cure the ablest men as professors,
regardless of all other qualifications,
excepting those of personal merit and
adaptation to the chairs that are to
be filled. Borrow if you cannot en
list. Give them freedom. Give them
auxiliaries. Give them liberal sup
port. Encourage them to come be
fore the world of science and of let
ters with their publications. Bright
students, soon to be men of distinc
tion, will be their loyal followers, and
the world will say Amen.
'' The merit of a university depends
on the men who are called to conduct
it, upon them absolutely if not exclu
sively; for although the teacher must
have such auxiliaries as books and in
struments —books are nothing but
paper and ink until they are read,
and instruments but brass and glass
until craft and skill are applied to
their handling."
But it is in its men that the real
university has its real being. Through
the work of such men it stands in the
vanguard of civilization. By such
men it counts the milestones in its
course, and no trick of organization,
no urging of the printing-press, no
subsidy of students, can be made to
take their place.
A final word as to the practical side
of advanced research. Mr. Carnegie
once ascribed the foundation of his
great fortune to the fact that lie first
employed trained chemists where
other manufacturers chose workmen
skilled in making steel by rule of
thumb. His chemists were able to
suggest improvements. They de
vised ways of making better steel
cheaper still, and at the same time of
utilizing the refuse or slag
In the future the success of each
great enterprise must depend on the
improvements it makes. The nation
successful in manufacture and com
merce will be the one richest in labor
aiding devices. All these must de
' pend on the advancement of knowl

edge. Pure science must precede
applied science.
Once the manufacturer or the na
tion could hire its chemists as it needed
them. The few asked for were al
ready made. Now they must make
them. The advancement of any
branch of science depends 011 the
mastery of what is known before.
Everything easy and everything in
expensive has been found out. To
train the chemist of the future we
need constantly finer instruments of
precision for his advanced work, ac
cess to greater and greater libraries
that he may know what is already
done, for each generation of scientific
workers must stand on the shoulders
of those gone before, else it can make
110 progress beyond them. The
scholars of today would be helpless
were it not that they can save time
by drawing freely on the accumulated
knowledge of the past.
To learn the elements of any science
costs little. It can be learned at one
end of a log with a great teacher on
the other. It can be even learned
without a teacher. But to master a
science so as to extend its boundaries
—this is quite another thing. More
than a man can earn in a lifetime it
costs to make a start. For this rea
son a university which provides means
for such work is a very costly estab
lishment. For this reason the inves
tigator of the future must depend on
the university. The nation with
the best equipped universities will
furnished the best-trained men. On
the universities the progress in man
ufactures and commerce must depend.
Through the superiority of training
Germany is passing England in the
commercial world in spite of her
handicaps of position and history.
Through the excellence of her uni
versities, without most of these hand
icaps, America is likely to excel both
Germany and England.
As men of science are needed,they
cannot make themselves. Those with
power can help them. This fact has
given the impulse to the far-reaching
gifts of Stanford, Rockefeller, Carne
gie, and Rhodes. These are not gifts
but investments put to the credit of
the country's future. The people,
too, have power to give. The
same feeling of investment has
led them to build their state
universities, and to entrust to
them not only the work of per
sonal culture, but of advancement in
literature, science, and arts. With
general culture and professional train
ing must go the advancement of
knowledge, the progress of society,
through the advancement of the wis
dom and the power of man.
