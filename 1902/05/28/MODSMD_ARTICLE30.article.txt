### 
The lowa Board of Control has
recently adopted the following in
signa for varsity athletes: The var
sity initial is to he a black letter
"1" ten inches high. The following
souvenirs are to be granted to win
ners of the varsity: "I" football,
heavy old gold sweater with black
"I"; baseball, blue flannel coat and
cap, an "I" on pockets and cap,
with small initial "B" on each side
of "1"; track team, medium weight
white sweater with "1" in old gold;
tennis, old gold jersey with black
"I." A change was made in the
device worn on the track team
shirts, as the present insignia can
not be recognized at sufficient dis
tance on the field. The new pat
tern adopted is a large pair of black
cloth wings on the front of the shirt
with an "1" placed between the
wings by those who have won the I.
