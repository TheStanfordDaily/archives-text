''The world is not large enough
for Stanford men to become lost,
nor for the Stanford spirit to he
hidden." Already, graduates of
the institution are everywhere, do
ing their work among men, and
hound together hy a feeling of fra
ternal interest in the young, vigor
ous university which they love ah
their Alma Mater. Each year,
as a new class receives its diplomas,
the Stanford alumni and their in
fluence increase. From year to
year, the graduates, going forth to
all parts of the earth, find a wel
come from those who have lived
and studied and formed their
college associations not at "the most
richly endowed institution in the
world," hut "way down on the
Stanford farm" where the inspira
tion of a university in the vigor of
its fresh new life, the freedom of
outdoors, the heauty of the build
ings, the democratic spirit that
brings into close association the
students with each other and with
their professors, and, abovo all, the
inculcation of sane, common sense
ideals, —where these influences
make the feeling of fraternity of the
Stanford graduates one which can
not be appreciated by a person who
is not of them. Here, if anywhere,
we live our college life in our own
community, concerned with our
own affairs. That this intensifies
the spirit of fellowship but does not
unfit us for the problems of the
practical world, is demonstrated by
the success of those who have al
ready gone out.
Today the members of the Class
of 1902 join the alumni. They
form the eleventh group of gradu
ates, and mark the beginning ol
the second decade in the history of
the institution. They are repre
sentative Stanford men and women,
trained as those before them have
been, going to take their places as
useful citizens in the world. Their
advantages have been many. As
they • leave, they see Stanford

springing into its new life. They
have (studied on the shores of the
Pacific at what a recent visitor has
characterized as the "lighthouse to
the Orient.'' They have come from
all parts of America. They have
had east of them a view of
the entire United States in
true perspective, seeing the rel
ative importance of each part of
their own great country, with their
vision uncramped by the provin
cial narrowness characteristic of so
many places. They have had in
outlook to the west the Pacific
and the Orient, "the chief theater
of events in the world's great here
after."
On the threshold of these events,
in the atmosphere of growth and
progress and accomplishment, near
the Golden Gate of commerce, they
have prepared themselves to enter
into this future. They receive
their diplomas and leave with the
realization that the reputation of
the University, as Dr. Clampett
pointed out, depends not on the
strength of its faculty, but on the
men and women who are its grad
uates.
