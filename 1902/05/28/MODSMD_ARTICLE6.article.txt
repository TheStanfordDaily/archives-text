This issue of the Daily Palo
Alto closes the tenth year of the
existence of the paper. During
that time it has held its own with
contempories in the field of college
daily journalism, and has fur
nished a training school for
many men who have since
graduation gone into news
paper work and other pursuits.
Although it has been under direc
tion of twenty different editors-in
chief since its foundation, little
change from the plan first adopted
has seemed necessary to succeeding
generations of the men in control.
From a business standpoint, the
Daily has suffered many vicissi
tudes, and its very existence has
at times been threatened. Some
plan needs to be devised to remove
the management from the vagaries
of student body politics, in order
to insure the permanent security
of the publication. This problem
is one to be solved by the organi
zation of a private stock company
or by the adoption of some system
in the business department, similar
to the editorial policy, which pro
motes men as they familiarize
themselves with their work and
prove to be competent. While the
editorial position is still an elec
tive one, a strong comment on the
success of the scheme is seen in
the fact that for four successive
semesters there has been no com
petion for the chief position be
tween men who were eligible to
run for the office and who were
qualified to fill it, but who refrained
out of respect to seniority of claim
and position.
With the opening of greater
things for the University during
the next ten years, the Daily Palo
Alto promises to keep pace with
the advancement.
