In an edition of the college
paper which is intended solely to
[reflect the gayety and the solem
nity of Commencement week, when
another class of graduates is pre
paring to leave its Alma Mater,
there seems something incongruous
in referring to unrelated subjects,
especially to those of an unpleasant
nature. Since, however, the Presi
dent of the University has seen fit,
in exercising his functions as ad
j ministrative officer, to call for the
| resignation of a prominent member
of the faculty, and since this in
jcident has been made the basis for
j a sensation by the outside press,
I the affair, so vitally interesting to
jail students because of its wide
spread publicity, justifies comment
here.
It is natural fora man who feels
that he has been wronged to de
sire to lay open his grievance.
This is especially true when the
unfortunate one occupies a semi
public position, causing attention
to be directed to his movements.
But this fact does not alter the
equally obvious truth that in the
administration of any large organi
zation or enterprise, misunder.
standings and friction are likely to
arise between the various individ
uals and forces which should
work together in harmony to make
the organization effective. Just
as certain as misunderstandings
spring up, just so certain is it nec
essary to overcome the discord.
But these things need no argu
ment nor exposition. The case in
point is simply that President Jor
dan, for what he considered suffici
ent cause in the interests of effec
tive harmony, asked for the resig
nation of Professor Pease. The
latter, at least realizing that there
was friction even before he received
the request, called fora specific
statement of reasons for the de
mand. The President referred
merely to earlier discussions that
had taken place between them on
the subject. Professor Pease, who
evidently believed his reputation
would he injured by a dismissal
which, however, he had the option
of making at least to appear
as voluntary withdrawal, pre
pared a long statement showing
how he had been injured,
and gave it to the public press
! with the purpose of vindicating him
j self from alleged charges that would
otherwise never have been known,
; and with the effect of causing dis
credit to fall upon the University,
ilt has grown to be an old story
.for the members of the Stanford
j faculty who have, unintentionally
|or otherwise, become the causes of
! discord with respect to the admin
istration, to be held before the public
jas martyrs. When abrupt action
is taken, when a man is called
upon to sever his relations with
what he has been long and closely
| associated, the wrench is a severe
| one. Nevertheless, the administra

tion of a university, as well asof any
other enterprise, is often forced to
act summarily.
With Stanford students, there is
no question as to the personality of
Professor Pease, nor his scholar
ship. They admire both him and
Dr. Jordan. But no one man is
larger than the University, of
which President Jordan is the ad
ministrative head. In any busi
ness organization changes that
seem important are constantly
made. They often cause misfor
tune to individuals, but they are
considered essential, and the public
peace is not disturbed with sensa
tions and recriminations. When a
misunderstanding arises, when
friction develops, when a clash oc
curs which threatens the welfare of
an institution, one obstructive force
must be overcome. If it is the ad
ministration, then the harmony of
forces disintegrates. If it is the
individual, injury may come to
one for the sake of continued ad
vantage to the many.
As a man and a teacher, the
students admire Professor Pease.
They deplore the unfortunate chain
of circumstances which has cul
minated to his disadvantage. They
sympathize with him in any mis
fortune he may experience, but
they do not sympathize with an
attempt upon his part to make the
University and its head odious to
the public. Such an attempt,
under the present conditions, will
re-act strongly. The question is
clearly one of lack of harmony,
and we feel that our President acts
with the broad interests of the Uni
versity at heart. When we reach
contrary conclusions, we will leave
the institution. These conclusions
will not be forced upon us by a
public airing of personal misunder
standing. Such a course enhances
our loyalty, which is not servile but
is based on a rugged Western inde
pendence and common sense view
of things, recognizing that strong
personalities may disagree, and
that harmony is essential to ad
ministration.
