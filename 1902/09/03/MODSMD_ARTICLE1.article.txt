# CHANGES OF A SUMMER.
## Vacation Has Witnessed Multifold Improvement About the University and Campus. 
### 
Many improvements have been
made about the University during
the three months' vacation, and the
new buildings have progressed very
satisfactorily. A deal of attention
has been paid to beautifying the
grounds, with the rtsults apparent
in added attractiveness. Many new
trees and plants have been set out,
and particularly all the dead palms
on the avenue leading to the Uni
versity have been replaced with new
ones. A line of water pipe is being
laid along this avenue to keep
the palms well watered.
Probably the most striking im
provement noticed is the new ter
race wall in front of the facade.
This is not yet in a state of com
pletion. Stone steps leading to the
Library, Arch, and Science build
ing, respectively, are to be putin as
soon as the stone arrives; and the
ornamental pillars at these entran
ces are to be capped with Japanese
bronze figures and electric globes.
Two fine pieces of Japanese bronze
work have been mounted on founda
tions of boulders: one repre
senting a huge eagle has been sta
tioned between the Chemistry build
ing and the Museum, while its
companion has just been placed in
position south of the location of the
new Gymnasium. A Hag-pole two
hundred feet high is soon to be
erected on a concrete foundation at
the head of University avenue.
There have been several unavoid
able delays in the preparation of
the plans for the Gymnasium, and
while the stakes are all set out,
ground will not be broken for two
weeks. The laying of the corner
stone, to be held under the auspices
of the students, will occur as soon
after that as possible. Graders are
busy digging the foundations for
the additions to the Museum, and
work on the walls will soon fol
low.
In general, the contracts for all
the new buildings announced have
been let with the exception of the
Gymnasium, and contractors are at
present figuring on this.
The slowest progress is noted in
the building of the main facade.
The Science buildings west of the
Arch are in a fair state, there yet
remaining a little additional inter
ior woodwork and the installing of
the apparatus. The History and
Economics building adjoining the
Library has just been lathed.
Plasterers will start operations soon,
and the carpenters will follow with
their work as rapidly as they are
able. The incompletion of these
apartments will cause considerable
crowding in the class-rooms the
first semester, but it is confidently
hoped that all the buildings of the
facade will be ready for classes the
second semester.
The Chemistry department will
retain its present quarters in the
Inner Quadrangle until Christmas.
The desks, shelving, and work
tables are being installed in the
new building, but the entire struc
ture will not be ready for occupancy
before the second semester. The
Memorial Church is in about the

same state of completion as in May.
More mosaic work has been putin,
but a great deal of that already
arranged for is being delayed by
the non-arrival of the mosaics from
Italy. Additional carving is to be
put on the walls, and this and other
improvements to be added will in
all probability delay the dedication
of the edifice until Thanksgiving or
later.
The front of the Museum has
been beautified by the placing of
mosaics in the eight panels ad
joining the main entrance. The
four completed ones represent Rome,
Egypt, Architecture, and Painting,
and the Italian artists are now
busy on the four to the right of the
entrance. The mosiac on the front
of the Church was finished early in
the summer.
The Mechanical Engineering Lab
ratory is almost completed. The
stonework is finished, and the
carpenters are busy with the inter
ior woodwork. The apparatus for
this building will arrive soon, and
will be installed under the personal
supervision of Professor A. W.
Smith. The entire building will
be ready for occupancy in about a
month. The masonry of the
Mechanical and Civil Engineering
building, which forms the south
west corner of the Outer Quadrangle,
is completed to the Becond story.
The Administration building, ad
joining that now occupied by the
German and the Latin depart
ments, will be completed for occu
pancy by Christmas.
Contracts have been let for the
Geology and Mining building,
which is to form the southwestern
corner of the Outer Quadrangle.
Demolition of the Camp struc
tures began right after the close of
college last year, and no material
evidence now remains of the build
ings that were so vitally connected
with the early days of the Univer
sity. Their destruction will pro
vide space for an avenue, on which
will soon rise new houses.
Among the minor improvements
carried on during the summer have
been the replacing of the tin roofs
of the Library and Assembly Hall,
with tiles, the construction of a new
granite base for the Stanford group
in the memorial quadrangle, and
the laying of concrete walks in
the Inner Quadrangle to take the
place of the aßphalt so long in
use. The walks are not yet
finished. There will be one
running east and west to the arches,
and another from the Church
towards the center arch of the Inner
Quadrangle. The space between
these walks and the arcades will be
filled in with gravel or some other
suitable substitute.
Numerous delays have been met
by the fraternities that had planned
to erect new chapter houses on
Lasuen street during the summer.
There have been several difficulties
in the leases, and as a result the
new Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi,
and Delta Kappa Epsilon homes
will not be commenced before the
middle of this month. The colonial
house that Mrs. Stanford is erecting
for the Rev. Heber Newton is
approaching completion, and bids
fiiir to be a distinct addition to the
arcbit«cti>.Kl beauty of the ''Row."
