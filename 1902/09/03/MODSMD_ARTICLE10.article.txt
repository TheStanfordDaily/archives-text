# REOPENING OF THE INN.
## Second Year of Cooperative Management Began at Noon Yesterday. 
### 
The Stanford University Inn
opened its doors yesterday noon and
will continue throughout the year
under the cooperative management
established last fall. The Inn is a
student enterprise deserving the
support of the patrons of student
affairs. While under its present
management it has existed only a
semester, it has clearly shown its
ability to vie with any previous
system or management. The weak
points have already made them
selves evident, and it is the purpose
of the leaders of the organization
to eradicate all unprofitable features.
The interests of the Inn have been
looked after during the summer
months by Lloyd Harter and Mr.
Strowbridge.
The Inn starts out with a good
many radical changes in the make
up and corps of
assistants. In the kitchen will
reign anolderand more experienced
chef, the salary of the position
having been raised so that induce
ment could be offered to a first-class
and capable man.
A regular assistant has been put
in charge of the pantry, and the
service will necessarily be much
more efficient than formerly. A
systematic and effective waiter sys
tem has been developed. Last semes
ter's service, which was somewhat
disorganized, has been remedied to
the fullest extent possible. Over a
hundred dollars worth of crockery
and table ware has recently been
purchased.
The Inn Club starts better
organized and better equipped for
fulfilling'the purposes for which it
was formed than ever before. All
superfluous expenses will be cut
down, in order to put the largest
percentage possible on the table.
The larger the number of members
the better the table; and a consider
able increasever last year's mem
bership is looked for.
The movement during the first
few days of the semester, on account
of the rn my changes may not be as
smooth aslooked for, but very little
time will "see things in running
order. Mr. Strowbridge has estab
lished credit for the Inn among the
business men of San Francisco.
Good goods, at lowest prices, to be
set before the members of the associ
ation with the least possible ex
pense,' willjbe the goal of the mana
ger's endeavors.
