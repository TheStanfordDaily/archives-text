# LABOR BUREAUS BUSY.
## Christian Associations Meet Unprecedented Demands with Gratifying Success. 
### 
The Student Employment and In
formation Bureau of the Chris
tian Association, in charge of Lloyd
Harter, '01, and Miss K. R. Kip,
'03, has been unusually successful so
far this year. During the past three
weeks some ninety young men have
written asking for information in
regard to employment at the Uni
versity for the coming semester.
Thirty-two new men have already
registered with Mr. Harter for em
ployment, a number far in excess
of that of any previous year. Thir
ty-six men have been given work
by the bureau, and about one-fifth
of the places filled will be perma
nent throughout the year. In addi
tion to the above there are about
twenty-five steady positions to be
filled in the University Inn, but
most of these will go to the old stu
dents.
Those in charge of the bureau
have been very favorably impressed
with the appearance and general
character of the men who have ap
plied for work. The supply of men

desiring work, however, is somewhat
in excess of the demand. In past
years there has always been a great
scarcity of student help, but there
is Buch a large number of appli
cants at present that conditions
may be reversed. In the case of the
women there seems to be a scarcity
of applicants. Notwithstanding the
fact that a larger number of young
women than ever before have ap
plied for work all have been given
positions, and there is yet a consid
erable demand.
The change in the location of the
information bureau from the corner
of the quad to the arcade next to
the Registrar's office, has been effec
tive in sparing the Registrar the
bother of answering many trivial
questions, which are now directed
to those in the information bureau.
The Stanford Hand-books printed
yearly by the Christian Association
are out, and may be had upon ap
plication at the bureaus.
