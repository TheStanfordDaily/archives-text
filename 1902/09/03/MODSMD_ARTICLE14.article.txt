# DEATHS DURING VACATION.
## Two Members of the Faculty and Three Students Passed Away This Summer. 
###

acterized by an unprecedented num
ber of deaths among Stanford peo
ple. Hardly a week had passed
after the University closed its doors
for the vacation before Charles D.

neath the Palo Alto oaks. A few
days later, in Southern California,
Librarian Nash passed away.
Scarcely two weeks more and the
funeral of Theodore G. Hosmer, a
member of the class just finishing
its sophomore year, was held. Ihen
on July 10th the news of Alfred
Sill's death reached his friends in
Palo Alto. Professor Richardson
died on the 26th of July.
HERBERT CHARLES NASH.
The death of the Librarian oc
curred at the Hotel Keller, Pomona,
where he had gone in search of
health, accompanied by his wife.
The trouble was Bright's disease, a
development from a pulmonary
affliction of long standing. A pro
tracted Biege of ill health had re
sulted in a leave of absence early
in the year, and Mr. Nash had left
immediately for southern California,
visiting San Diego, Palm Springs,
Claiemont and Pomona. Little
relief was obtained, and toward the
last failure was rapid. The end
came on the afternoon of June 6th,
interment taking place in the
Arboretum "God's Acre," on the
campus.
Herbert Charles Nash was the
son of an English clergyman, and
was born at Nice, France, Aug. 25,
1857. He was educated in the
College of France. From 1877 to
1881 he was vice-consul of the
United States at Nice, and in 1880
became tutor of Leland Stanford,
Jr. After Leland's death he took
Senator Stanford's secretaryship
and accompanied him to Washing
ton. Later he acted as secretary
for Mrs. Stanford, and in 1896 was
appointed University Librarian.
From 1886 he served the Board of
Trustees as secretary. In various
lines of activity besides his own
specialty he served the faculty and
students. The staging of amateur
theatricals was a diversion of his
to which many of the older students
are indebted for pleasant hours.
In a literary way he had done
much quiet work, an address deliv
ered at the dedication of the new
Library in 1900 being of especial
note.

development from a pulmonary

sulted in a leave of absence early
in the year, and Mr. Nash had left
immediately for southern California,
visiting San Diego, Palm Springs,

relief was obtained, and toward the
last failure was rapid. The end
came on the afternoon of June 6th,
interment taking place in the

campus.

ton. Later he acted as secretary
for Mrs. Stanford, and in 1896 was
appointed University Librarian.
From 1886 he served the Board of
Trustees as secretary. In various
lines of activity besides his own
specialty he served the faculty and
students. The staging of amateur
theatricals was a diversion of his

In a literary way he had done
much quiet work, an address deliv
ered at the dedication of the new
Library in 1900 being of especial
note.
