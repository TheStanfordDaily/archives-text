As soon as the preliminaries of
registration and schedule-making
are out of the way, a meeting will
be called of such students as con
template working on this paper
during the present semester. In
the meantime all prospective or
possible staff-members are urged to
visit the ottice in order to familiar
ize themselves with its methods,
and to become acquainted with the
students whose apprenticeship was
served under former editors. There
are many places to fill this year,
and the requirements are very sim
ple. Reasonable familiarity with
the English language and a willing
ness to work are the main qualifi
cations, and every candidate is as
sured of a thorough trial. Those
who have joined forces with the
Daily in the past have for;", J the
work remunerative. The
except for the editor-in-chiev s ncfl
pecuniary, but is felt in experi
ence, in the consciousness of being
constantly and vitally in touch
with the University's broad life, as
well as being of direct personal ser
vice to one's fellow students.
In the process of observing the
phenomena of college activity at
close range, and bringing them
nearer to others, there has been
an attraction and even fascina
tion. For many there is the incen
tive of promotion, and for all in
valuable experience. To the man
or woman intending to enter the
newspaper field the college daily,
amateurish though it is, and
cramped in its efforts, offers a
training the value of which is at
tested by the proverbial success of
its graduates when newspapering is
taken up as a profession. All can
didates are offered equal opportuni
ties, and women as well as men are
needed.
Some of the entering clnss have
already expressed a desire to join
the staff. Jt is hoped that all con
cerned will consider this a personal
invitation to visit the oflice. The
place to be filled by the paper de
pends on the quality and energy

of its staff, factors which are deter
mined largely by the number of ap
plicants.
