Since college closed last May stu
dents and faculty have been dis
bursed over the country, some in
search of recreation, some industri
ously at work, and all pleasantly
anticipating a return to the quad
rangle. The annual reunion and
greeting of familiar faces is, per
haps, the rarest pleasure of college
life. But —and some of us are just
learning this for the first time —there
are a little band who have not re
turned, who will never return. With
unwonted frequency Death has vis
ited the Stanford community this
summer. Two members of the fac
ulty, after years of heroic struggle
against ill-health, responded to the
final call. In Librarian Nash and Dr.
Richardson havfe been lost friends
and leaders. Three students, whose
hearts were as light as ours last
semester, whose health was as vig
orous and enthusiasm as everflow
ing, have likewise obeyed the sum
mons. The news of the death of llos
mer and Montgomery and Sill was
as unforeseen as it was pathetic. All
were endowed with qualities that
compel our admiration. The re
bunion is saddened, our thoughts
are chastened. A University mourns
its children.
