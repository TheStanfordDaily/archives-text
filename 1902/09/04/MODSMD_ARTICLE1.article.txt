# THE
						FOOTBALL OUTLOOK.
## Though Chaotic, the Prospectus is Not Discouraging to the Cardinal. 
### 
The football team of 1902 is as
yet considerably in the rough.
Any guess concerning the make-up
of the team might after a few weeks
development prove unwarranted.
Across the bay is a veteran team.
Stanford must make a winning
team out of material much of it
new and inexperienced in inter
collegiate contests. There are some
of the old men back; a number of
last year's second team may win
the big white "S" before the season
is and out of the large mass
of untutored product from the in
coming class, Varsity backs and
linemen may be secured. On the
squad will be but few who have
ever played a season together on
the same team. Team-work will
have to be developed from the start.
The men realize that they will have
to fight, and the words of Trainer
Christy,spoken to his men in Berke
ley at their first big rally, that
"Stanford concedes us the game,
which is peculiar as it is the first
time Stanford ever conceded ub
anything," have not the least foun
dation in fact.
Of the old center trio —Lee,
Thompson,and Barnhisel —Lee will
be able to play, and possibly Barn
hisel. Hauverman, who got into
the game at center last year, is by
far the strongest man up for the
vacant position. Roosevelt will be
in the University, but will probably
be unable to play. Ralph McFad
den, the big tackle, is back. For
the ends' positions considerable
competition may be looked for.
Cooper, Clark, and Paul Tarpey
are expected to enter the play, and
possibly Fisher. For places back
of the line, Bansbach is generally
conceded his old place at quarter.
"Pie" Smith will again be in the
race for his half, and McGilvray
will make his first try for the
Varsity with his eye on the full
back's job. "Guiby" Dole will
probably try for Traeger's old
tackle on the left side of center.
There are a number of old second
team men who will get out on the
field, among them Wilfred Dole,
Butterfield, Crawford, and Knight.
At present it is hard to estimate
the freshman material, for high
school careers often count for little
in the university. From the size of
the class, and the number of husky
looking freshmen wandering around
the quad, a much better freshman
team than usual may be expected.
At any rate, the number of candi
dates should much exceed that of
last year. The most likel}' man of
the lot now above the horizon
seems to be Magee, who has played
with Santa Clara College for the
last four years, entering in the con
tests against the last four freshman
teams. His specialty is punting.
Husky, a big 200-pound Texas
man, displays considerable agility.
From the Southern California
high schools several good men have
come. Hopkins, Harwood, and
Hyke, old team-mates of "Stub"
Raitt, are from San Bernardino;
and Paxton, from Santa Ana,
should do well. Thompson and

Smith, two Denver players, will try
for tackle and end. Cheadle and
Morrissey, from Iowa; Meikle, an
end from Portland; Frizzell, a Port
land Academy tackle; E. Flanders
from Chicago, and Bogle from Vir
ginia, have all of them shown up
well on their "prep" school teams.
There are many others of experi
ence.
So far a head coach has not
been secured. Treasurer Edwards
and Captain Lee are working
earnestly toward a final settlement.
Until that time Slaker will have
charge of the men. Next week,
probably Monday afternoon, will
see the initial appearance of the
squad on the field.
Assistant-Coach Frank Slaker,
who arrived Monday, is hopeful
of success. Slaker's career in foot
ball has brought him in contact
with almost every kind of player,
and has made him familiar with
nearly every style of play. As
player and coach he has been a suc
cess. The men who have fought
with Slaker, and those who followed
his instructions in preparation for
the Michigan game, have full con
fidence in their old team-mate.
This confidence the student body
shares.
The football field will shortly be
in readiness for the initial practice.
For some weeks Manager Edwards
has been burning and clearing the
weeds from the gridiron. Several
car loads of sawdust, mixed with
the soil, will give the players a
much softer field for play, and
should result in a decreased number
of casualties for the season.
Harry Edwards of Stanford, and
Ezra Decoto of California, the two
student body managers, are having
trouble in obtaining grounds for
the annual game. The old grounds
at Sixteenth and Folsom have been
torn up for building. Several pros
pective schemes have been looked
into by the managers, but so far
nothing satisfactory has been ar
ranged. A proposition is on for
converting the grounds at the corner
of Dolores and Eighteenth into a
field, will be looked into, and either
rejected or accepted. In case it is
rejected it is highly probable that
the game will be played upon the
Berkeley campus.
A decision will be reached to
morrow morning.
