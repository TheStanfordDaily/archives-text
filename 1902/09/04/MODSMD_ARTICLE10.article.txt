In surveying the chances of the
Cardinal in the athletic contest of
the coming year, an unprejudiced
judgment must admit the outlook
to be good. Our football men were
never possessed of a greater unanim
ity of determination; our track team,
with Moulton and McCaughern at
its head, seems unusually hopeful;
and after witnessing the last base

ball game Done can say that we
may not win the series in the
spring. To the winning of these
contests should be brought every
force and influence which are with
in the control of the student body
and the members of the student
body. No loyal Stanford man
would knowingly do aught to
hinder the officials or the players
in the full performance of their
duty; but Stanford has suffered an
immense amount in the past by
the prevalence of a spirit of criti
cism among a certain percentage of
undergraduates. To wilfully preju
dice a coach, trainer, or captain; to
make hard the doing of the things
he should do; to discourage or kill
the spirit of confidence which every
successful team must have in its
leaders, is a brand of unthinking
treason which has in the past
allowed itself to assume too large
proportion. This lack of discre
tion, the failure to bury selfish in
terests for the good of the cause,
has driven many a sincere and
competent coach to despair, and
brought many a good team to de
feat. The chance for Cardinal
victories is here, and it behooves
every Stanford man to put his
shoulder to the wheel and push.
