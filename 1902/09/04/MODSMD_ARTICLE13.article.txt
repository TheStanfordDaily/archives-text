The departments of Engineering,
Geology, and Chemistry have is
sued a register of the graduates in
these departments from 1892 to
1901. Published by private sub
scription and compiled by mem
bers of those departments which
have to do to so great an extent

students in these departments an
insight into the future is given, the
occupations of their predecessors

rational expectations. In many
cases, where alumni have slipped
beyond reach of the editors, data
are lacking, but the following sum
mary can not but be interesting as
well as of great practical value to
tbose in whose field it lies:
