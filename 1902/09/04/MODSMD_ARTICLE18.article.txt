# DEPARTMENT REORGANIZED.
## Electrical Engineering Changes. New Quarters and Equipment Assured. 
### 
The Electrical Engineering de
partment ha√ü been entirely re
organized and assigned into new
quarters. Professor A. \V. Smith,
recently returned from a leave of
absence, is to be the administrative
head of the department, while the
acting head will be Assistant Pro
fessor F. G. Baum. Two new
student assistants, J. P. Jollyman,
'03, and A. S. Kalenborn, '02, have
received appointments in the de
partment. The main part of the
electrical work will be assumed by
these men, supplemented by Pro
fessor Smith in his courses in the
Mechanical Engineering of Power
Plants. The department is in
communication with one of the
most promising electrical men in
the East, with the intention of
having him give a course of lectures
on the electrical side of the central
station.
This department will be in better
shape this year than ever before.
Its location is changed 'to the
new Mechanical Engineering build
ing, while the building formerly
occupied has been cleared of parti
tions, and will be used as a machine
shop. New equipment for the elec
trical men is arriving every day,
and all the apparatus ordered is to
be here soon, and installed before
Christmas. The greater portion of
the money appropriated is being
expended for dynamos, motors, and
transformers, and everything is of
the latest pattern.
