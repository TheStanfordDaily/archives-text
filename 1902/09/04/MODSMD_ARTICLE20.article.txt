# “Sequoia” Out Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The Sequoia will make its first
appearance of the year tomorrow
morning, when it will be placed on
sale on the quad. The general
style and make-up of last year's
paper has been followed, but a new
dress of type and a careful atten
tion to details has added, if pos
sible, to the attractiveness of its
appearance. The leading feature
of this issue is a sonnet by 11. E.
Ren and, as good a piece of verse as
has ever been written at Stanford.
The article of most general interest
is "The Football Outlook," by
Howard S. Lee, football captain.
A characteristic sketch entitled
"Old Hank," by T. E. Stephenson,
occupies the position of honor and
deserves it. Other stories, all of
them good, are "A Thanksgiving
Game," by Ruth Fowler; "Benicia,"
by M. A. R.; "The Boy's War," by
Mabel H. Brown, '03; and"The
New Baby," by Alice Aileen Hig
gins. The "Sketch Book" is made
up of contributions from H. R.
Johnson, '04, W. G. Deal, '04, 1). M,
Reynolds, and the editor, Walde
mar Young, '04.
