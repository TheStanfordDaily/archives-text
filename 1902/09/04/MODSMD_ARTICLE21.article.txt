# Planning for Gym. Work.
## 
### 
Instructor Chappel, of Encina
Gymnasium, who is to have charge
of Mr. Storey's work during the
latter's absence, has announced
that gym. work for the semester will
be inaugurated on Friday. All
students intending to take Hygiene
I (physical training) should regis
ter at the gymnasia before Friday.
This applies to women as well as
men.
An improvement made in Encina
gym. during the summer has been
the moving of the door, leading
from the entrance hall to the locker
rooms on the ground floor, so as to
secure a solid wall back of the
small handball court. The addi
tion of a climbing-pole to the drill
apparatus will soon be made.
