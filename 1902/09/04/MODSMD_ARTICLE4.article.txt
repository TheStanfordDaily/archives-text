# STANFORD WEDDINGS.
## Many College Romances Reach Happy Culmination During the Summer Months. 
### 
One of the features of the sum
mer iu which University people
took considerable interest was the
unusual number of marriages where
one or both the contracting parties
were alumni or students of Stan
ford. Each vacation has its quota
of matches resulting from under
graduate romances, but it has ap
parently remained for the summer
just ended to eclipse all its prede
cessors in this respect. An attempt
has been made to notice such
nuptials as have received local an
nouncement, a complete recapitula
tion being a seeming impossibility.
The wedding season received an
early start in the marriage of Hazel
Hope Webster, '02, to Ray Spencer,
of Portland, on the day Miss Web
ster received her diploma.
The following week occurred the
nuptials of James T. Burcham, '97,
LL. 8., '01, instructor in the Law
department, and Aemilie A. Henry,
'03, at Salem, Oregon.
At Napa, in July, James Lana
gan and Clara Earle, both gradu

were married. Lanagan played on
the '99 and '00 baseball teams, and
was pitcher and manager during his
senior year. He was a member of
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs, and
of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon frater
ity. He is now instructor in Latin
at Belmont School. Miss Earle was
a member of Alpha Phi, and prom
inent socially.
Bertrand W. Townsend, '96, for
a number of years a resident of
Palo Alto, now a mining assayer in
Colorado Springs, was united in
marriage with Miss Sybil M. Stone,
of Coulter, California.
Elizabeth A. Pratt, '00, of San
Francisco, was wedded to E. W.
Clapp, of Lordsburg, New Mexico,
in June.

Stanford, A. M. '97; senior mem
ber of the firm of Jordan Brothers,
of Palo Alto, and Miss Mildred
Hitchcock, of Napa, were married
at Napa during the same month.
Two weddings of special interest
were those of "Nat" A. Carle, '97,
tackle on the '97 Varsity, to Miss
Wood, of New York City, and of
Frank Branch Itiley, '00, former
Glee Club leader, and now of the
law firm of Riley & Riley, Port
land, to Miss Lottie E. Brand, '00,
