# HEAVY REGISTRATION.
## Enrollment of Students Shows Considerable Increase Over Last Year. 
### 
The total number of new stu
dents registered at 5:30 o'clock to
day was 311. Last year's total for
the day was 255. The total regis
tration to date is 97 in excess of
last year.
The figures given out today from
the Registrar's office show that the
number of matriculated students
already registered exceeds that of
last year by nearly fifty. The
total of old students enrolled dur
ing the first two days was 764,
against 723 for 1901. Complete
figures are not yet obtainable for
the class of 1906, but the long line
of students from nine this morn
ing until the close of registration
indicates that the baby class will
be a record breaker. There is a
probability that the number of
women students is close to the
limit of 500 set by Mrs. Stanford.
Complete figures of the entire en
rollment of both old and new stu
dents will be available tomorrow.
