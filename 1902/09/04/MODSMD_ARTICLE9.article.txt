The prospective success of the
University Inn as it enters upon
its second year under the only
management that has ever approxi
mated the satisfactory, is most
gratifying to club members and
directors. In years past Stanford
students, particularly Encina men,
have looked forward to the day
when all could gather in a great
University commons, with fellow
ship fostered by good living and
economy accompanying both. To
a sufferer under the old regime it is
a little hard to realize that for once
a dream bids fair to come true; that
after a period of uncertainty and
dissatisfaction, dating from the
University's early years, Stanford
has at last a student dining-hall
worthy of the name. Because they
brought about this phenomenon,
the founders and directors of the
Stanford University Inn Club stand
in the light of public benefactors.
The experiment inaugurated last
January they have seen grow into
an institution for which perma
nency seems assured. The new Inn
commences the year with a credita
ble past and a bright future, and
inasmuch as the campus commun
ity sometimes neglects to give credit
where it is due, we take particular
pleasure in calling attention to the
fact.
