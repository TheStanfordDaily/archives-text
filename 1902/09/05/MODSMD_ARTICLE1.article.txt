# PRACTICE AND RALLY.
## Monday Will Mark Inception of the Cardinal Football Season. 
### 
Monday afternoon marks the
beginning of the football season at
Stanford. Captain Lee has issued
a call for all old men, as well as
candidates for the Freshman team,
to don suits and appear on the
gridiron for the initial practice of
the year.
Monday evening in Encina club
room there will be held an informal
rally for all men in the University.
The idea of the gathering is to
start the season with a spirit of in
terest in the work of the men, and
loyal and enthusiastic support of
Assistant-Coach Slaker and Cap
tain Lee on the part of every stu
dent. Every man who will ap
pear on the gridiron is expected to
to be there to sign for the position
at which he aims to play. "It
might be well to mention at this
point," said Captain Lee, "that
in all probability there will be
no signing of training rules.
Such a call on the part of the
coach does little more than foster
a spirit of distrust and suspicion.
But the appearance of a man in
football clothes will be taken as a
virtual pledge that he will in every
way obey training rules, and no
man will be tolerated on the field
who does not fulfill this unsigned
promise.
"There are many positions, and
every man will be given a chance.
During the hot weather only light
practice will be held, but all men
are expected to be out at once.
"The rally in the club'room
should begin the season with a feel
ing on the part of the bleacherites
that they must support the team,
the coach, and the captain, first,
last, and always, â€”and this is the
feeling that helps in developing a
winning team."
