# JOHN E. BLAIR.

### 
Professor John E. Blair, the new
Law professor, comes to Stanford
with an enviable record. Profes
sor Blair's undergraduate days were
spent at Mercersburg University,
Pennsylvania, where he received
the degree of Bachelor of Arts in
1896. Immediately after his grad
uation he entered the Boston
School of Law and the Harvard
Law School, from which he was
graduated with honors in 1899.
Although the active work in which
he engaged was of short duration,
the prominence of the law firms
with which Professor Blair was
connected in Boston added in no
mean way to the reputation which
he had gained at the Law School.
The University of North Dakota
enlisted his services in 1899, and
he took up the work of organizing
a new department of law. His
work there was distinctly success
ful. At Harvard, Professor Blair
was active in football, playing
half-back on the team of the Law
School with Professor Lewers. His
interests at North Dakota lay in
the same direction, he having en
tire charge of athletics. Besides
being a football player he is a
baseball enthusiast, and in both
lines should be a material addition
to the coaching force. Professor
Blair will give three courses in the
Law department: Evidence, Part
nership, and Corporations.
