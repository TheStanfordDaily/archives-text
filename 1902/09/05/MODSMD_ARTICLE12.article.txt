### 
Instructor Gleorge L. Clark, who
assumes the duties of Law instruc
tor, has had only a limited teach
ing experience, but is thoroughly
familiar with the field which he
is about to enter. He graduated
from Kenyon College in the class of
'96, and began his law work in the
Indiana Law School almost im
mediately. In '99 he finished his
work at the University of Indiana
and left for active practice, later
taking up his studies at Harvard
Law School. He spent two years
at Harvard and so nearly com
pleted the work, which usually re
quires three years, that he will be
enabled to take his degree of LL.B.
"in absentia" sometime in the near
future. His experience as a teacher
is limited to his work at the sum
mer school of the University of
Indiana, where he was a member
of the law facultp during the sum
mer session of 1900. At Stanford
Mr. Clark will give three courses:
Contracts, Torts, and The Conflict
of Laws.
