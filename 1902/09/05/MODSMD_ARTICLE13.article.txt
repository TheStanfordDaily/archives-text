# ENGINEERING LABORATORY.
## Equipment of Mechanical Department To Be the Finest in the United States. 
### 
Work is proceeding rapidly with
the installation of the machines in
the Mechanical Engineering labor
atory. The new engines are being
fitted to their concrete bases. While
all the apparatus and equipment
ordered has not arrived on the
ground, yet enough is already here
to give some idea of how thoroughly
the new quarters will be fitted for
the work. Professor Maddock is
putting in the machinery as fast as
it arrives. During the next few
months the laboratory students will
be given an opportunity to assist in
erecting the machines, an experi
ence in practical engineering which
undergraduates seldom get while at
college.
The total cost of the laboratory
equipment is in the neighborhood
of $30,000, the greatest proportion
of which has gone for machinery.
The entire plant has been designed
to give a variety of every type of
steam-engineering machinery, and
as a result of the efforts of the de
partment this branch of engineer
ing will have an equipment for lab
oratory work that is surpassed by no
other institution in the United
States. There are larger buildings,
but none so thoroughly fitted.
Eight thousand dollars has gone
into machinery for the shop that is
being arranged in the building
formerly occupied by the depart
ment as lecture rooms, the parti
tions having been taken out. Short
ly, everything incidental to 'a
modern machine shop will be in
stalled. Accommodations now ar
ranged will enable about forty stu
dents to work. Of these Professor A
ndrew A. Browne, who has just come
from the Mexican Lead Company,
at Monterey, Mexico, will have
charge.
Classes in Mechanical Engi
neering are to be held in the
annex to the laboratory for this
semester only, after which it is in
tended to conduct them in the
building now under construction
in the southeast corner of the Outer
Quadrangle. The early completion
of the wooden floors in the labora
tory will provide room for the
classes in laboratory work.
A partial list of the new machin
ery, either on the ground or ordered,
is as follows: One 220-pound water
tube boiler, 100 horse-power ; one
GO horse power horizontal return
tubular boiler; one 30 horse-power
vertical boiler; two condensers of
a total capacity of 160 horse-power;
one 60 horse-power cross compound
condensing Nordberg engine ; one
30 horse-power Westinghouse com
pound condensing engine; one 30
horse-power Ames simple engine;
one 100 horse-power Ideal tandem
compound condensing engine; a
refrigerating plant with capacity
for making 1000 pounds of ice every
twenty-four hours; hot-air and gas
engines; oil testing machines; dyn
amometers; and fuel colorimeters.
In general everything that is neces
sary in a modern and well equipped
steam engineering plant is to be
provided.
