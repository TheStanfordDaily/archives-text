The increased number of those
who have paid their student body
assessments is one of the most pleas
ing features of the last three days
of registration. The existence of
such an assessment is suflicient
proof that it is levied for a purpose
and ought to be paid. It is but a
slight pledge of the faith which each
of us should have in the student
body management —a mere significa
tion of personal interest in the
activities which center around the
student body treasury. Stanford's
assessment for athletic purposes is
slight when compared with many
of the Eastern institutions, where
ten dollars annually is not con
sidered exorbitant. While pleased
with the indications, we must de
plore the fact that the payment is
avoided by anyone. The manifest
unfairness of allowing a percentage
to support that which gives consider
able benefit to the whole should in
some way be remedied. The man who
consistently refuses to recognize the
student body in financial affairs,
shouts side by side on the bleachers
with he who has paid his dollar;
his ballot dropped in the election
counts for as much as the ballot
of his less conscientious fellow stu
dent, Such a condition should not
be permitted in so stable an organ
ization as the Associated Students.
The management has for years
wrestled with this problem, and as
yet has found no means to enforce
payment other than that which
arises naturally in the conscience of
the individual. That the assessment
should be paid by all, or by none,
has for some time been proclaimed
by those who have felt the sting of
unjust taxation, and the cause for
complaint is evident. The matter
is something which should receive
the earnest attention of not only
the treasurer and executive com
mittee, but of the student body at
large.
