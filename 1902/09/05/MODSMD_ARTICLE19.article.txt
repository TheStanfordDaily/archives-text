## University of California Opened August 14th.â€”Beginning of Athletic Season. 
### 
The University of California
opened its doors for the new year
August 14th. Although no odicial
statement of the number of stu
dents has yet been made, it is un
derstood that the entering class
numbers about GOO. Over 2000
matriculated students have re
turned, and the total undergradu
ate registration for the year gives
promise of passing the 3000 mark.
Football practice began last Fri
day, and Coaches Whipple and
VVomble are busy working on the
material for the Freshman team.
The prospects of a strong team
seem to be good, as a number of
"prep" school stars are numbered
among the new men. Some of
those who bid fair to make their
positions are: Gillis of Belmont,
Belknap of Exeter, McCoy of Berk
eley, Middleton of Lowell, Robert
son of Alameda, Filcher of Los
Angeles, Solinsky and Voltz of
Berkeley, and Googan and Arlett
of Oakland. Others who promise
to make the fight for positions in
teresting are: Wilkens of Oakland,
Saben of Exeter, Clary of Peralta,
Allen of San Diego, Brien of Men
docino, Sterns of Humboldt, Geary
of Seattle, Weile of Santa Barbara,
llolden of Napa, Giesting of
Lowell, Griffin of Visalia, Osgood
of Sacramento, Burns of Fresno,
and Linscott of Berkeley.
The coaches are being assisted
in their work by the old Varsity
men who have returned.. These
are Hudson, Mini, Stroud, Sher
man, Whipple, More, Stow, and
Overall. Gendotti, Hansen, Starr,
and Duden of last year's Varsity
will not return, and new men must
be developed for their positions.
It is reported that Clay of the '01
team will return to college, and
if this be true both guard positions
will be well filled. Mush of the
second team has the best chance for
Duden's place at full, and Bary,
formerly of Boston "Tech," is also
showing up well in practice.
Although there are no baseball
stars in the university this year
there is certain to be a strong
team in the field. Braley and
Hamlin have graduated, and Wil
liams has turned professional.
Causley, '06, and Adams, '04, are
out for second, and Hansen seems
the most likely candidate for
pitcher's position, to supplement the
work of Overall. Hendericks, '05,
Hatch, '05, and Heitmuller are
other likely candidates.
