# Library Improvements.

Several important and interest
ing changes have been made in the
arrangement of the University
Library during the last summer
with an idea toward increased effic
iency for this year. Some twelve
hundred new volumes, most of
which are for the History depart
ment, have been placed on the
shelves. The departments of Eng
lish Literature and of Economics
and Sociology are now arranged to
correspond to the department of
History, that was last year put
under what is known as the
"Dewey" system, an arrangement
much more elastic than that form
erly used. The paper labels here
tofore bearing the shelf numbers of
the books are being replaced by gilt
print, giving the books a much
neater appearance. Another addi
tion which the Library hopes soon
to have is its own book-bindery.
About seventeen hundred volumes
are sent yearly to the bindery in
San Francisco to be repaired and
bound. With a bindery of its own
the Library can have this work done
in shorter time and at less expense
than at present.
A regular attendant will be on
duty in the reference room during
the coming year to assist those
using the books of general reference.
The leading English dictionaries
have been removed from the refer
ence room and will occupy the
shelves heretofore used for the cur
rent magazines in the main reading
room. The History books kept in
the reference room last year have
given place to the bound volumes
of the leading magazines, and must
now be obtained at the desk.
Owing to the crowded condition
of the classrooms in other build
ings, the University has found it
necessary to convert the large con
versation room of the Library
building into a lecture room, and
doors are being hung which will
separate it from the reading room.
A change that has added much to
the outward appearance of the Li
brary building is the removal of the
sheet-iron roof and its replacement
with tiles. A similar alteration
has been made on the roof of
Assembly Hall.
