# Professor Sanford's Book.

### 
Professor Fernando Sanford's
new book on physics was brought
ought during the summer by the
Henry Holt Publishing Co., of New
York.
The book is intended for use in
the high schools as a text book and
manual, and is a decided improve
ment over the text-books now in
use. It contains over four hundred
pages of well illustrated text, treat
ing of the latest discoveries in elec
tricity, light, color-photography,
etc., as well as the time-honored ex
periments of Galileo and Newton.
The professor does not find it
necessary to push the book much â€”
it is doing that for itself. It has
already been adopted by many pre
paratory schools, among them the
high school of Palo Alto. It is
probable that Sanford's Physics will
soon take its place as one of the
standard school books of the coun
try.
