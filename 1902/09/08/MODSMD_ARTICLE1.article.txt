San Francisco will again be the
scene of the annual contest with
Berkeley. Success has at last at
tended the efforts of the two student
body treasurers in securing grounds
for the annual football contest in
November with theUniversity ofCal
ifornia. The old Jewish cemetery
grounds at the corner of Eighteenth
and Doloreß in San Francisco have
been leased for two years, chiefly
through the efforts of Dave Brown,
Stanford '97. Work on the field
will begin immediately, so that by
the 18th of October the gridiron
will be in condition, and bleachers
will have been erected with a seat
ing capacity of 10,000, including
3,000 covered seats. The site is a
particularly desirable one, owing to
its close proximity to the old
grounds at Sixteenth and Folsom
streets, and its easy accessibility by
street car lines.
The schedule of games for the
Varsity is far from complete, but
it is certain that of the five games
to be played by the Reliance Club
with the two universities Stanford
will figure in three. The Cardinal
will meet its old rival for the first
game of the season on September
27th, and again on October 11th
and 25th.
The annual games with the Uni
versity of Nevada will be played on
the Stanford campus on November
Ist, one week before the crucial
match with the University of Cali
fornia takes place in San Francisco.
The Multnomah Athletic Club of
Portland, and the University of
Oregon, may be included in the
schedule, but arrangements with
them are yet tentative.
Manager Edwards has already
secured four dates for the freshmen.
On September 20th they meet St.
Matthew's for their first game. Bel
mont will play the freshmen on
the 27th of September, and Santa
Clara College on the 30th. A date
for the game with Berkeley high
school has not yet been chosen, but
in all probability this game will be
the last of the preliminaries.
