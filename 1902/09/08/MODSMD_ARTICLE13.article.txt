A growth from a Hag station to a
town of nearly 3000 inhabitants in
twelve years is progress indeed, and
is in keeping with the Western
ideas of expansion. Palo Alto is
advancing with great strides to be
one of the most important tow nr. of
the peninsula. That this is t'lie
is shown by the fact Mi at -,he
Southern Pacific Company now
runs a new way train to Palo A Ito
every night at 11:45, to supplement
the Saturday theatre train to I: an
Jose.
A number of new business bio ;ks
will be erected on University a se
nile. Most prominent among these
are the Masonic Temple at a cos .of
$20,000; and a new three-story hi >ck
building for the Bank of Palo A to,
to be erected on the site of the pres
ent building.
