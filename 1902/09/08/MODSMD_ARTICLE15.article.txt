A certain professor in charge of
a popular course whose recitation
period is the first hour in the
morning announced the other day
that after the last bell rings at 8:20
his classroom doors will be shut.
Among late risers and habitual
delinquents, of whom the Univer
sity unfortunately has its full
share, the decree has created no
end of consternation; for the class
happens to be one in which an ab
normal number of cuts is a serious
affair. Notwithstanding, it would
appear that the lecturer in ques
tion has made a happy discovery.
The plan has the double merit of
being simple and efficacious. As a
preventative of tardiness, a closed
door should discount a seinesterful
of objurgation. If the remedy
could come into general use, ap
plying to patrons of lectures and
entertainments as well as to stu
dents in the classroom, a long step
would be taken toward the abate
ment of a notorious nuisance.
