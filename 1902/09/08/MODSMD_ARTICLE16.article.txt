In another column is printed
that article of the California-Stan
ford Athletic Agreement which
rules the eligibility of contestants.
A careful perusal now of these
rules by the athletes of the college
will save much worry and conten
tion later on. However, these laws
should in no way deter any one
from trying for an athletic team.
Even if he is not eligible to the
teivm this year, let him get out just
the same in order that he may
absorb all he can from the training
and practice, so as to be prepared
when he becomes eligible. With
particular force this applies to such
freshmen and new men in general
as are debarred from participating
in intercollegiate games because of
lack of full standing. In athletics,
as in debate, it has been repeatedly
demonstrated that the successful
individuals are those whose train
ing dates from their first semester
at college. And beyond and above
the incentive of future honors is
the present urgent need of second

team men, upon whose ability and
willingness during the approach
ing season of preparation largely
depends the outcome of the final
contest.
