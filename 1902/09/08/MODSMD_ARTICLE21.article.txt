Dr. Barton Warren Evermann,
ichthyologist of the United States
Fish Commission, and formerly
lecturer at Stanford, has been at
the University since July getting
out a report for the government on
the fishes collected in Hawaiian
waters by Drs. Jordan, Jenkins, and
Evermann. Dr. Evermann has
been assisted by Mr. E. L. Golds
borough, who was a member of the
expedition, and by H. W. Fowler,
zoology special, and expects to be
at the work until the end of this
month. He brought the whole Ha
waiian collection here for study
and classification, because Stanford
possesses the best collection of Pa

ence, therefore affording the best
sources for comparison.
After the work of classifying and
cataloging is completed, the fish
themselves will be divided into sets
and distributed among the leading
museums of the country. The Stan
ford museum will be presented with
the most complete set of the whole
collection.
The report will be a very inter
esting and valuable book, contain
ing descriptions of all the fish,color
plates of the new species, number
ing from seventy-five to one hun
dred, and black-and-white drawings
of the others. There are over four
hundred species of fish in the col
lection, with numerous duplicates
of each.
Mr. Evermann has been con
nected with the U. S. Fish Commis
sion for fourteen years, with the ex
ception of the year from 1893-94,
which he spent at Stanford as
lecturer in Natural History.
