## 
### 
Professor Alphonso G. Newcomer
arrived on Saturday. He came
direct from London in answer to
the cablegram which Professor An
derson had sent him requesting his
return, Professor Newcomer hav
ing expressed his willingness to do
so in case the absence of Professor
Anderson was required by his phy
sicians.
Professor Newcomer and his wife
went first to England, where the
weather was so inclement that they
left at once for Holland instead of
for Scotland, as they had originally
planned. They went up the
Rhine, through Switzerland, and
into Italy, where a month was
spent. Returning to London, for
the six weeks previous to his recall
Professor Newcomer studied in the
British Museum, his investigaiions
being almost entirely on the sub
ject, "Possible Influences on Poe's
Poetry." His work in this line
was practically completed, but
other investigations which he had
planned were interrupted. Mrs.
Newcomer had returned about
three weeks before the cablegram
was received.
