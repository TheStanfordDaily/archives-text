# Stone Terrace to be Lowered.
## 
### 
After inspecting the stonework
which runs along the facade of the
Outer Quadrangle, Mrs. Stanford
has decided it is too high, and ob
structs the view of the buildings
behind; therefore she has ordered
that it be lowered a foot. The work
of alteration has already been begun.
