# FIRST FOOTBALL RALLY.
## Enthusiasm and Determination Characterized the Meeting in Encina Hall. 
### 
The football season of 1902 was
formally inaugurated in Encina
club-room last night. There were
present about five hundred men of
the University, who opened the
evening with a round of songs, the
old familiar ones: "One, Two, Three,
Four," "The Son of a Gambolier,"
and "Rush the Ball Along." The
college cheers were given with splen
did spontaneity. After a couple of
dances came the speeches of the
leaders, Captain Lee, Trainer "Dad"
Moulton, Coach Slaker, and Pro
fessor Lewers. The gist of all was
the accentuation of training rules
and the need of severest'work on
the part of the team and the stu
dent body. Every one of the speak
ers seemed impressed with the fact
that the Cardinal has before it one
of the hardest propositions it has
had to face since 1898.
Captain Lee said in part that
every man possible should get out
and try for the team. He impressed
upon the men the necessity of keep
ing training rules. These, however,
they will not need to sign, but
any one detected in violating them
will be at once dropped from the
squad. He further appealed to the
student body not to tolerate any
infraction of these rules. He stated
that Stanford had a strong proposi
tion to face on November Bth next,
and urged the earnest cooperation
of every man and woman in the
University.
With that characteristic attitude
which has endeared him to every
Stanford man, "Dad" Moulton ex
pressed the seriousness of Ihesitfti
tion, and asked each one to do his
part to help turn the opposing odds
in our favor in the final game. He
spoke of the deplorable training of
other years, and declared that a
repetition would not be counte
nanced with his knowledge, and in
case of a violation either the offend
ers must go or he would. He
scorched the individuals who last
year spoiled the conscientious efforts
of the majority by the lack of hon
est training. He said ''there is only
one way to win, and that is to have
eleven men in the game."
Assistant-Coach Slaker spoke
briefly but to the point.He reiterated
the earnest words of Captain Lee
and positively declared for the
strict observance of training rules,
which would go into effect at once.
He, too, dwelt upon the adverse
chances, and begged each man to
fight hard to turn the tide Stanford
way next November.
Professor Lewers made a short
but intensely earnest and telling
speech in which he told about the
attitude of the alumni and what it
means to have a man like "Dad"
Moulton as a trainer. In closing
he said: "A united team, a united
student body behind them, and
hard work, will win. We will win
because we are up against it; a Stan
ford man always rejoices when he
is up against it, because ho knows
that he can pull out."
After this about seventy men
came up and put their names down
as candidates for the teams; nearly

two-thirds of these were new men.
The total number is not as large as
in former years, but as it is very
early it is hoped that there are
many who have yet to register as
candidates.

Lunt, the dashing end of the '04
team, will be out in a few days.
He, with Stanford, '04, ought to
enliven the race for the end posi
tions.
The football season of 1902 was
formally inaugurated in Encina
club-room last night. There were
present about five hundred men of
the University, who opened the
evening with a round of songs, the
old familiar ones: "One, Two, Three,
Four," "The Son of a Gambolier,"
and "Rush the Ball Along." The
college cheers were given with splen
did spontaneity. After a couple of
dances came the speeches of the
leaders, Captain Lee, Trainer "Dad"
Moulton, Coach Slaker, and Pro
fessor Lewers. The gist of all was
the accentuation of training rules
and the need of severest'work on
the part of the team and the stu
dent body. Every one of the speak
ers seemed impressed with the fact
that the Cardinal has before it one
of the hardest propositions it has
had to face since 1898.
Captain Lee said in part that
every man possible should get out
and try for the team. He impressed
upon the men the necessity of keep
ing training rules. These, however,
they will not need to sign, but
any one detected in violating them
will be at once dropped from the
squad. He further appealed to the
student body not to tolerate any
infraction of these rules. He stated
that Stanford had a strong proposi
tion to face on November Bth next,
and urged the earnest cooperation
of every man and woman in the
University.
With that characteristic attitude
which has endeared him to every
Stanford man, "Dad" Moulton ex
pressed the seriousness of Ihesitfti
tion, and asked each one to do his
part to help turn the opposing odds
in our favor in the final game. He
spoke of the deplorable training of
other years, and declared that a
repetition would not be counte
nanced with his knowledge, and in
case of a violation either the offend
ers must go or he would. He
scorched the individuals who last
year spoiled the conscientious efforts
of the majority by the lack of hon
est training. He said ''there is only
one way to win, and that is to have
eleven men in the game."
Assistant-Coach Slaker spoke
briefly but to the point.He reiterated
the earnest words of Captain Lee
and positively declared for the
strict observance of training rules,
which would go into effect at once.
He, too, dwelt upon the adverse
chances, and begged each man to
fight hard to turn the tide Stanford
way next November.
Professor Lewers made a short
but intensely earnest and telling
speech in which he told about the
attitude of the alumni and what it
means to have a man like "Dad"
Moulton as a trainer. In closing
he said: "A united team, a united
student body behind them, and
hard work, will win. We will win
because we are up against it; a Stan
ford man always rejoices when he
is up against it, because ho knows
that he can pull out."
After this about seventy men
came up and put their names down
as candidates for the teams; nearly

two-thirds of these were new men.
The total number is not as large as
in former years, but as it is very
early it is hoped that there are
many who have yet to register as
candidates.
