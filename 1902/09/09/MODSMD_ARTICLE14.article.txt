There is one man here who when
he speaks to us always warms our
hearts and makes us determined to
continue the fight with all the
power there is in us. Those who
heard "Dad" Moulton at the foot
ball rally last night will stand con
vinced that we have scarcely ever
had a professional man here who
has exhibited a more disinterested
and impersonal attitude towards
athletics. Anything for Stanford's
victory and advancement! It is he
and men like him who instil the
spirit of unity and self-effacement
deep down in the heart of our stu
dent body, where selfish and criti
cal contention can never reach. It
is such a spirit as emanated from
him last night that destroys uni
versity partisanship and makes us
neither Athenian nor Macedonian,
neither Barbarian nor Greek, but
Stanford men. From the attitude
of this man we may draw a lesson
which will lead us to get together
on this one point, athletics, and
thereby enjoy at least our Bhare of
the victories. Let each one of us
try to see if we can forget ourselves
for this year in the interest of Stan
ford.
