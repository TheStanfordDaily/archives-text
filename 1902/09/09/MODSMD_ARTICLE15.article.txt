Quietly, without public procla
mation, Mrs. Stanford is planning
and working day by day to complete
theplansof the University. The an
nouncement is now allowed to be
made that the contract has been
let for the new Gymnasium. This
means that work will soon begin
on a building for physical training,
which in plan, in equipment, and
in every appointment —to say noth
ing of its architectural beauty —
will equal or excel any other struc
ture of the kind on this continent.
The life of the college is complex,
and the departments are varied, so
that nothing else cements and
unifies the students as does
their work in the gymnasium
and in athletics. No other build
ing will be received with more en

thußiasm than this one. To know
that the facilities for physical devel
opment and recreation are to be
commensurate with the other ad
vantages for which such magnifi
cent equipment is being supplied,
causes general rejoicing.
Accustomed as we are to see
buildings under way, the like of
which has not been known at an
educational institution, we may
perhaps take it all as a matter of
course. The Gymnasium, how
ever, is peculiarly a building for
the students. Representatives of
the student body were consulted in
regard to the plan. Their sugges
tions were largely adopted, and
were improved until the result
could not be more satisfactory.
Neither noisy demonstrations nor
extravagant phrases will express to
Mrs. Stanford the genuine pleasure
which the student body feels at the
fact that they are to have a build
ing like this, and that she has
taken such pains to arrange it as
they desire.
