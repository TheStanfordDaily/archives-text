# Work on Gridiron Commences.

Only thirty appeared on the old
baseball field for the first practice
of the year; but those thirty spent
a very active hour in going over the
rudiments. The situation this early
in the season looks much as it did
in 1898: comparatively few seasoned
Varsity men in sight, while at Cal
ifornia there is almost a full quota of
veterans with which to begin the
year. The extent of the work was
punting and holding the ball and
a short run around the baseball
diamond. Signal practice will be
gin next week, as the first game is
only three weeks off.
On the field there were of the
Varsity: Lee, Hauverman, McFad
den, Tarpey, Cooper, Clark, Bans
back, and McGilvray ; Bartell,
Blodgett, Blake, Dole, Knight,
Kehrlein, Taylor, Ritchie, Wilbur,
Kennedy, of the second team; and
Chandler, Smith, Magee,Macintosh,
Chandler, and Morrissey, of the
freshmen.
