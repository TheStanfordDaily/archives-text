The patronage of the University
Inn has increased to such an ex
tent in the past few days that the
management are finding it diffi
cult to handle the trade. Yester
day there were 125 transients at
lunch, in addition to the 153 regu
lar boarders. For this reason it
was found necessary to reserve
seats for regular boarders only until
12:25, after which one hundred or
more transients may be cared for.
The stockholders now number
153, regular boarders 171, and stu
dent help from 40 to 45.
