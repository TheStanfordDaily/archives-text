# CONTRACTS ARE LET.
## Work on Stanford's Great Gymnasium Will Commence Next Week. 
### 
The contracts for the stonework
of the new gymnasium were let by
Mrs. Stanford on Saturday. Jno.
1). McGilvray was the successful
bidder on the cut-stone above the
foundations, while Dave Brown,' 97,
got the contract for the work em
braced in the foundations. The
first dirt will be turned next week,
and operations will be rushed in
order to have the cornerstone laid
in about six weeks. This day will
be a gala day for Stanford. The
students will have entire charge of
the exercises at the laying of the
stone, and plans are already on foot
to make the occasion a memorable
one for the University.
There have been no great changes
in the plan of the building since
they were outlined last May. The
front will be Grecian, with ten six
foot columns. The entire length of
the structure is to be 295 feet, and
the width 197 feet. There are three
stories. The enterior arrangement
is the most complete possible, with
everything specified that a modern
athletes' home needs.
Architect Hodges will have the
stakes set out for the foundations
tomorrow, and the teams and men
will start very soon thereafter on
the excavating.
A sketch of the interior view of
the gymnasium will be put on the
bulletin-board at the Registrar's
office in a few days.
