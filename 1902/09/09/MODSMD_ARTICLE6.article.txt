### 
Regular work commenced at the
Roble gymnasium on September
Bth. About two hundred girls have
registered for work. It is the inten

bring into use a uniform mode of
dress, and to this end they have se
lected conventional black serge
suits and white collarettes.
Classes meet Mondays, Wednes
days, and Fridays at 10:15 and
11:15 a.m., and at 3:30, 4:30, and
5:30 p.m. The regular routine
consists of Swedish drill and free
work on the floor under Miss Dick
inson's directions. The leader sys
tem will be established for appara
tus work in the gymnasium. Miss
Rose will have charge of all ath
letic games, both indoor and out
door.
