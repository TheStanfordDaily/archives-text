# Museum Additions Begun.
## 
### 
This morning saw the beginning
of work on the foundations for the
additions to the Museum. Exca
vating has been going on for some
time, and will proceed to enable
the concrete men to follow with
their work.
A solid parapet railing is to be
built along the entire top of the
present building. Scaffolding is
now in place before the main en
trance, to assist in this improve
ment. The figures now crowning
the entrance will remain. The
railing is to be of stone and will
present a very attractive appear
ance.
