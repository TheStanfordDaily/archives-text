# Second Football Practice.
## 
### 
There was a slight increase in
the number of men turning out for
football practice last night. Coach
Slaker took the men to theoval and
tried the new sawdust field. "Dad"
Moulton had a few of the men
starting from the mark, a practice
which will he continued throughout
the season. Under the direction of
Slaker and Professor Lewers some
drill in falling on the hall was
given. Coach Slaker has expressed
himself as desiring the appearance
of a much larger number of players
from the freshman class.
