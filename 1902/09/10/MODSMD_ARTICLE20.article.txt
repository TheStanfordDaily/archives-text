that after the announcement that

run on as close a margin as possi

The items in the above report
have been condensed as much as
possible, in order to economize
space.
In explanation of the small bal
ance left on hand, it may be said
that after the announcement that
Mrs. Stanford would almost imme
diately begin the construction of
gymnasium and athletic fields, no
attempt was made by the finance
committee to leave a large balance
for the Training-house fund, since
such fund is to be put to merely
auxiliary use. The attempt was to
run on as close a margin as possi
ble.
The 80 cents balance is to be de
voted to a fund for the establish
ment of a chaij in Freshman Eth
ics, said chair to be filled by a
sophomore.
