The members of All Souls' Epis
copal Church, New York City, have
received a letter of farewell from
Rev. Dr. R. Heber Newton, who
resigned the rectorship last spring
to take charge of the Stanford Me
morial Church. The lettercontains
the message which illness prevented
Dr. Newton's'delivering from the
pulpit at the time of his resigna
tion, and was written from his
summer home on Long Island. It
said:
"Through the past two or three
years I had grown increasingly per
suaded that my strength was being
overtaxed and that it no longer
sufficed to do justice to the work in
All Souls' Parish. At the end of
last year most unexpectedly the in
vitation came to me to accept the
position of preacher in the newly
erected University Church of the
Leland Stanford Jr. University, to
preach to the hundreds of young
men and young women gathering
in this great University; to help
thus in the formation of their char
acters, in the formative period of
life; to have a share in molding
the men and women who are to
build our wonderful Western em
pire— this presented itself to me as
an honoring work iirwhich anyone
might rejoice.
"The nature of this ministry,with
its exemption from parochial re
sponsibilities, appears to provide
me a work within the limits of my
strength, and the change of climate
and the new surroundings give
hope of continuing my power of
work for some years to come."
