# NEW TENNIS COURTS.
## Treasurer Edwards Will Appoint a Committee to Solicit Subscriptions. 
### 
Treasurer Edwards lias decided
to start a subscription list for the
raising of funds with which to lay
a new tennis court. His reasons
for calling upon the members of the
student body for funds are numer
ous. "The old courts," he said,
"are entirely inadequate for the
development of tennis material, and
in every way unfit for a good man
to play upon. In the first place
they run in the wrong direction;
both in the afternoon and morning
the sun shines directly in the eyes
of the player on one side of the net,
making every match an unfair one.
The surface of the court is cracked,
and during most of the year is over
grown with weeds.
"The student body is not so situ
ated financially that it can build
new courts, and new courts are a
necessity if we give our men the
opportunities that are accorded our
opponents. One new court should
be built and reserved for the use of
the best of the tennis squad.
"Feeling this necessity for a new
court and realizing that it is im
possible for the student body to
procure one, in its present financial
condition, I have decided to start a
subscription list. For about $175
a good court can be built. I shall
appoint a committee at once to so
licit subscriptions. After the stu
dent body has had the matter
brought to its attention in this
manner, I see no reason why we
cannot have a good tennis court
within a few months."
