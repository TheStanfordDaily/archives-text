### 
Mr. George L. Noyes, the new in
structor in the Drawing depart
ment, readied the campus on Sun
day afternoon and commenced work
on Monday. He is a native of Can
ada, where his early education was
obtained.
Before going abroad in 1887 he
studied art one year in Boston in
the private studio of George Bart
lett, now head of the Boston Art
Club. Mr. Noyes spent four years in
the best studios of Paris, under the
instruction of such men as Ridens,
Calloit, and J. Blanche. His studio
work was supplemented by travels
in many lands. Me visited Italy in
1891, and again in 1896; painted
Algerian landscapes during the
winter of 1892, and did considerable
work in Mexico in 1897 and 1898.
In 1892 he exhibited in the Paris
Salon, and has exhibited annually
in the Hoston Art Club, the Phil
adelphia Academy, and in the In
stitute of American Artists in New
York. He has pictures on exhibi
tion now in Chicago and Worces
ter, Mass.
Mr. Noyes makes a specialty of
landscape and figure painting.
Some of his most recent work has
been with marine views. At pres
ent his classes aredrawing the head
from life.
This is his first position as a
teacher of drawing, but Mr. Noyes
is by no means a novice in the art
of instructing. Last year he had a
large class in painting in Wor
cester, Mass.
