## Former Stanford Student Successful in San Rafael Tennis Tournament. 
### 
j Louis Freeman, ex-' ( J9, won the
tennis championshipof the Coast in
| the singles and helped win the doub
les at the Hotel Rafael courts Mon
day and Tuesday. The doubles
match Monday between Freeman
and Hell forSouthern California,and
Smith and McGavin of San Fran
cisco, resulted in a victory for the
Southern men. The score, 7-5, 6—4,
2-6, 3-6, 6-1, indicates how close
was the contest for the coveted
honor.
1 he singles match between Free
man and W. B. Collier of San Fran
cisco yesterday resulted in a walk
over for Freeman. Freeman was
the favorite candidate, but such a
decisive result was hardly expected.
The final score was 6-0, 6-4,6-3.
The only match in which Free
man was unsuccessful was in the
mixed doubles Saturday, when he,
with Miss Violet Sutton, was de
feated by Bell and Miss Gabrielle
Dobbins by a score of 7-6, 6-2.
Freeman, whose home is in Pas
adena, was a member of Sigma Rho
Eta, now Delta Kappa Epsilon.
He was a notable Stanford athlete,
in that he won sweaters in football,
baseball, tennis, and track—the
only man who ever represented
Stanford successfully in all four
athletic departments. He already
held the title of champion of South
ern California before the present
tournament, and he has twice won
the championship of the Pacific
Northwest.
Commenting upon yesterday's
game, the Chronicle says:
"It was conceded by everyone
that Freeman played a wonderful
game. He is undoubtedly one of
the steadiest players ever seen here,
and his smashing overhead work
could not be improved. His great
improvement at the game was com
mented on by those who saw him
play with Stanford against Berke
ley three years ago."
Merle Johnson, '97, and Harry
Wei he,03, also took part in the
tournament.
