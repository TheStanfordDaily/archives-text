# Glee Club Will Hold Try-Out.
## 
### 
A try-out for all positions on the
Varsity Glee Club will take place
the early part of next week in the
chapel. First tenors are scarce,
and any men having such voices
are asked to come around to the
test. The try-out will be con
ducted by a competent musician
and will be strictly impartial. In
all probability the clubs will go
north during the Christmas holi
days. Besides this, numerous side
trips to neighboring towns will
occur from time to time. The ex
act date of the try-out will be an
nounced in Monday's issue of the
Daily Palo Alto.
