Thk attitude of the student body
toward training has in the past
been very loose and inconsiderate.
It has helped toward more than one
Stanford defeat. Public opinion is
strong in influence, and had Stan
ford men and women demanded the
strict discipline necessary to the
making of an ideal athlete; had the
odium, which at every Eastern uni
versity is instantly attached to any
one who breaks training, been
attached to those who risked the
safety of the Cardinal by failing to
do everything in their power to win,
the ignoming of the ninth of No
vember last would never have been
ours.
In an article entitled "College
Honor," in October's Atlantic Month
ly, Dean Briggs, of Harvard, says,
in speaking of the peculiar status
of integrity among undergraduates:
â€¢'Another healthy sign is the high
standard of honor in athletic train
ing. This standard, indeed, may be
cruelly high. The slightest breach
of training condemns a student in
the eyes of a whole college, and is
almost impossible to live down."
In how far could this be said of
Stanford? The time has come for
us to take a stand in this matter.
The man who pretends to be play
ing "everything for Stanford," and is
not, is a traitor. He deserves igno
miny; he deserves, as Captain Lee
observed at the rally on Monday
night, "to be run out of college."
The coach, trainer, and captain
have taken their stand, and the

man who breaks training rules will
be dismissed from the squad. It
remains for the student body to
furnish that degree of sentiment
which will back them up to the
very fullest extent. The feeling and
attitude in regard to athletics
has changed within the last
eight months. We have watched
this growth toward a higher ideal
with an uncommon amount of
pleasure, for we realize that in a
stricter, more consistent policy does
the salvation of our athletics lie.
It is necessary that the growth of
the sentiment be nurtured until it
has become as strong as the senti
ment existing in institutions of
equal standing in the East.
