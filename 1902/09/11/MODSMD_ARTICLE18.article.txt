"A House of Days" is the title
that Christian Binkley, '99, has
chosen for a volume of his verse,
which is brought out by A. M. Rob
ertson, San Francisco. The book
has been enthusiastically received
bv the reviewers. The Sacramento
Bee says :
"So far as comparison may be
made with work of like character by
California writers, Mr. Binkley is
the peer of any. As a sonneteer,
however, he far transcends them all.
Mr. Binkley's work is not only the
niostnotablecontribution yet made
to poetic literature in California,
but will place its author in the
front rank of American poets.
Thought, art, tact, and well bal
anced judgment are combined in
his work, and though A House of
Days sings mostly sonnets yet
there is no suspicion of monotony."
The San Francisco Chronicle :
"Mr. Binkley's work is far above
the level of current verse, for it re
flects a sincere, unworldly spirit,
yearning to express itself in song."
The Salt Lake Tribune calls it"a
worthy contribution to literature
that cannot fail of deep apprecia
tion."
Mr. Binkley has charge of the
English and history department in
the Cogswell Polytechnic School of
San Francisco.
