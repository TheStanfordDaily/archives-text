# Encina Crowded.

### 
In the history of the University
Encina has never been so crowded
as it is at this time. Many old stu
dents retained the rooms which
they occupied last term, and these,
with the large number of freshmen,
have filled the Hall to the limit.
There are now two hundred and
eighty-five men holding rooms, and
besides these many are waiting for
quarters. The management this
week opened the space above the
club-room, where there are ten
rooms. A part of these are engaged
already.
