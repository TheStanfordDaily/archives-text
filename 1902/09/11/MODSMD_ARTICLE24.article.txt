# CHANGES IN FOOTBALL RULES.
## Innovations in Gridiron Tactics That Go Into Effect This Season. 
### 
The new football rules serve to
regulate the game better than ever
before. There a>re several alter
ations, but the most important is
the provision for a change of goals
after each touchdown, no matter
which side has the ball. This
change serves to equalize the
chances of the teams with regard to
wind and sun. Likewise there is a
change of goals after a goal from
the field.
Rule 16, Sec. b, says:"In snap
ping the ball back, if the player
doing so is off side, the ball must be
snapped again. If this occurs more
than once on the same down the
opponents shall receive five yards,
the number of the down and the
point to be gained remaining un
changed." This makes the penalty
also severe, as the offending side
simply loses five yards instead of
the ball as heretofore.
Few points in the game have
caused more trouble than the one
elucidated by Rule 18, Sec. c: "If
five players, not including the
quarter-back, are behind the line of
scrimmage, they must occupy one
of the three following positions:
First, all five of such players may
be inside of the positions occupied
at the endß of the line of scrim
mage, in which case two of the
players must be at least five yards
back of the line; or, second, if one
of the said five players be outside
of the line occupied by the players
at the end of said line, then only
one other of the players need to be
five yards back of the line; but,
third, all five of these players may
be nearer than five yards to the
line of scrimmage, if two of them
are outside of the positions occu
pied by the end of said line."
"Outside" is interpreted as meaning
outside the extreme foot of the
players of the opposing side at the
end of the line.
Coaching from the side-lines is
still further penalized. Only five
men shall be allowed to walk up
and down each side of the field.
The penalty is loss of five yards by
the side whose representative is the
offender.
For holding, the set-back penalty
is five yards instead of ten. The
unlawful use of hands or arms, off
side play, tripping, and tackling
below the knees, demands the pen
alty of five yards in the offenders'
territory; in case the offenders have
the ball the penalty is forfeiture of
ball. If the ball is in the air when
the offense is committed the ball
then goes to the non-offending side.
Still further with some rules:
"Whenever a foul is committed,
which, in the opinion of the um
pire, does not affect the play, the
offending side may decline the
penalty. In case of a run being
made from this play, not more than
twenty-five yards from the spot
where the foul was committed shall
be allowed."
More discretion is given to the
referee than in former years, with
regard to the calling of games, as
he may, when he thinks that dark
ness is liable to cut short the game,
arbitrarily shorten the time of the
two halves, and refusal to abide
by such decision shall mean for
feiture of the game.
