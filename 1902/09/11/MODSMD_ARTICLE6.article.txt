# STANFORD MEN IN JOURNALISM
## Rapid Rise of Two '99 Graduates on San Francisco Newspaper. 
### 
Two Stanford men whose under
graduate days are still very recent
have lately been promoted to posi
tions on San Francisco newspapers
that are commonly reached only
after a term of apprenticeship treble
what theirs has been. Both were
well known students and partici
pated in many branches of college
activity, and both started news
papering as members of the Daily
Palo Alto staff.
William 11. Irwin, '99, was pro
moted, September 9th, to the posi
tion of Sunday supplement editor
of the San Francisco Chronicle,
after three years' experience as a
member of the regular news-writing
staff. This is probably the most
important journalistic position so
far attained by a graduate of Stan
ford University. In college Irwin
edited the Daily Palo Alto, wrote
two farces, staged all the theatrical
performances during his time, won
the prize story and prize poem for
tlie Quad, and led the varsity yell
ing at the intercollegiate games.
After graduation he collaborated
with Charlie Field, '95, in the
writing of "Stanford Stories,"
edited the weekly Wave for several
months in San Francisco, and very
recently with Gelett Burgess wrote
a volume of short stories called
"The Picaroons."
Everett W. Smith, '99, at one
time editor and also business man
ager of the Daily Palo Alto and
Varsity track captain and inter
collegiate champion mile and half
mile runner, has recently been pro
moted on the San Francisco Chron
icle to the position of Coast editor,
after a service of three years in the
telegraphic news department, hand
ling market reports and smaller
items of Western news. He has
succeeded to the position occupied
by W. H. B. Fowler, who has just
entered Stanford after nine years of
service on the Chronicle.
Among other Stanford men who
are doing newspaper or magazine
work in the city are Archie Rice,
'95, John T. Waldorff, ex-'99, and
Herbert D. Walter, '99, of the
Chronicle; Merle Johnson, '97, art
ist, and JoeTimmons, '97, assistant
night editor of the Call; J. R.
Nourse, '97, in charge of the Exam
iner'â– s Oakland bureau; Joe Hamil
ton, ex-'Ol, editor and part propri
etor of the Hotel Gazette; and Wal
lace Irwin, ex,'oo, editor of the
Overland Monthly and assistant
editor of the News-Letter. Of these
men, Rice, Timmons, and Nourse
were editors-in-chief of the Daily
Palo Alto.
