# Season's First Line-up.
## 
### 
Only a small number of men
came out for football practice last
night. For half an hour punting
by Fresh man and Varsity candidates
was practised. Magee, fullback of
Santa Clara College, showed up
very well, his punts being sure and
long. The men lined up for the
first time, but so few candidates
were out that only.one Varsity and
one freshman team was on the
field. Captain Lee had charge of
the Varsity, while Coach Slaker de
voted his attention to the Fresh
man. Bucks and end runs kept
the men busy for half an hour,both
teams doing well for the first line
up of the season.
