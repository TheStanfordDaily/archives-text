# FOOTBALL SQUAD INCREASES
## Ten Additional Candidates Appeared for Light Work Yesterday. Varsity Lines Up. 
### 
The football practice lust night
was encouraging, in view of the
fact that ten more men were out
than on the night before. There
were twenty-two freshmen on the
field, making a decidedly encour
aging sight as they lined up in two
elevens. Captain Lee again had
charge of the aspirants for the
Varsity, while Coach Slaker took
the freshmen in hand. Starting
from the mark, tackling, and run
ning with the ball, punting, and
light practice in team work, were
all given a share of the time during
the practice. The Varsity material
was lined up in a haphazard man
ner which gives no promise of be
ing permanent. The following is
the personnel of the eleven: Dole, 1.
e.; Stillman, 1. t.; Crawford, 1. g.;
Lee, Hauverman, c.; Jacobs, r. g.;
McFadden, r. t.; Stanford, r. e.;
Bansbach, q. b.; Knight, Tarpey,
r. h.; McGilvray, 112. b.; Kennedy,
1. h. This impromptu team was
run through light signal practice,
one man being taken out to give
place to another at the direction of
the captain.
Slaker took charge of the fresh
men. The two teams on the field
were run through signals, but did
not line up against each other.
Magee at fullback, Mcintosh at
quarter, Estes at guard, and Chea
dle at tackle, all showed up very
well. Magee's punting was excel
lent, while Mcintosh is quick and
certain in his work.
The freshmen should soon round
into shape for their game with St.
Matthew's, at San Mateo, one week
from Saturday. They will go up
in the morning and take part in
the celebration of St.Matthew's day.
An elaborate banquet will be served
at noon, and the game will be called
in the afternoon.
Manager Edwards announced last
evening, immediately after practice,
that several new games had been
added to the schedule, and would
be announced soon.
Season tickets for the football
games will be placed on sale next
week. The price will be $2.50.
