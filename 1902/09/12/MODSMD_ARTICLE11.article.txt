At the head of this column today
appears a partial list of the students
who will help make the Daily Palo
Alto this semester. At present the
list contains only the names of those
who were with the paper last year,
their work being of a known stand
ard. Later —within twonveeks, prob
ably—there will be added to the
staff such candidates as shall in the
meantime have given sufficient evi
dence of energy and aptitude for the
work. In the past the scheme has
been tried of submitting all appli
cants to a term of probation, with
such good results that it is to be
adhered to in the composition of the
present staff. The statement of last
week that many places are open
still holds good; the number is
limited only by that of capable
applicants. And capability in this
case means primarily determina
tion, and a willingness to devote an
amount of time to the paper which
is regulated by the demands of Uni
versity work. Aspirants have ap
peared in force, but more are
needed.
