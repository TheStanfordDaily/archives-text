The announcement of a prize for
the best football song calls atten
tion to the urgent need at Stanford
of a good live song. The necessity
of getting to work at once cannot
he too strongly impressed upon
those who intend to enter this com
petition. More time must be given
to rehearsals this year, so that
when the intercollegiate comes the
songs may be given with volume
and unity. Heretofore, very few
of us have known more than the
chorus of any song. Nothing en
courages players more than the
strains of the favorite varsity song
offered by the bleachers. As an
example of live verses there is
Herkeley's "Palms of Victory,"
which curiously enough took only

an obscure prize in competition a
few years ago. Its popularity so
quickly grew that it is safe to say
there are very few University of
California students that do not
know it from start to finish. On
every occasion it is given with
such volume and precision as to
excite admiration. There is a very
dire need, then, at Stanford of a
song that will endure not only for
this year but for the future.
In this connection, the want of a
suitable song that can be given on
all occasions ought to be men
tioned. There is nothing that ex
cites the envious admiration of a
college man so much as to notice
the warmth and enthusiasm with
which Yale fellows sing "Brave
Mother Yale," whenever they get
together. Stanford ought to have
such a song, or one like "Fair Har
vard." It might be a good sugges
tion for the Executive Committee
to offer a prize for a college song as
well as for a football song.
