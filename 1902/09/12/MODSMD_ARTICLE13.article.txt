## 
### 
Williaih H. Irwin, '99, who with
Charlie Field, '95, wrote "Stanford
Stories," has become partner in
another book. In collaboration
with Gellett Burgess he has pro
duced "The Picaroons," a collec
tion of short stories purporting to
have been related at "Coffee
John's," a ten-cent restaurant in
the Bohemian quarter of San Fran
cisco. One of the tales deals with a
wild adventure that happened to
"Billy" Erb, '01, before he came to
Stanford. Serial and book rights
have been purchased by Pearson's
Magazine, in which publication of
the stories will soon begin.
