# Albertson May be Reinstated.
## 
### 
"Ox" Albert√üon, the ex-captain
of the University of California foot
ball team, has returned to college
and registered as a graduate stu
dent. He claims that as graduates
were not allowed to register un
til August 18th, his registration
was within the twenty-five days
limit set by intercollegiate agree
ment. Professor G. C. Edwards,
chairman of the faculty athletic
committee, however, counts the
days from August 14th, the day
college opened, and it was due to
his decision that the action of the
executive committee was taken.
Although Recorder Sutton sides
with Albertson, Professor Edwards
declines to reconsider his decision
and says:
"The decision of the committee
is final. Albertson did not come
up to the time limit and there is no
way he can play football this year
at the university."
It was Colonel Edwards who in
1899 prohibited Captain Whipple
playing in the Thanksgiving day
game against Stanford.
