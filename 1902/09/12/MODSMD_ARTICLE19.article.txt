# Effect of Ptomaine Poisoning.
## 
### 
Wednesday afternoon Professor
Newcomer was taken sick on his
way from the University, and on
arriving at his home he found his
whole family sick. It develops that
this is a case of ptomaine poison
caused by drinking affected milk.
On Wednesday a Palo Alto milk
man ran out of his milk supply
and bought an additional quantity
from a Portuguese milkman. The
result was that every one of his
patrons was poisoned that day.
The case of Professor Newcomer
and his family is not really serious,
but has sufficed to make them all
very ill, and to keep him from
meeting his classes. He will with
out doubt resume his work again
on Monday.
