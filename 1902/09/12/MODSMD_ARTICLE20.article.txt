Edward Loder, being duly sworn,
deposes and says:
1. It is the custom of all dairy
men in this town to supply each
other with milk when short of
milk.
2. I have been buying milk of
Nunez Bros, for a short period of
time. I have had some complaint
made in regard to the milk they
furnish me. The principal objec
tion up to September 9th was that
the milk did not keep well. His
milk never kept well. I had com
plained of this a number of times,
and on one occasion Nunez told me
that the cans and faucets that con
nect with the milk-tank had not
been cleaned, and were full of foul
milk. For a few days there was
not so much complaint, but after a
short time the milk became sour
and was not satisfactory, as before.
Then, to satisfy myself, I kept a
portion of his milk and set it at
night. This was on Sunday night,
September 7th, and I found the
next morning early that it was
spoiled.
When he came with the milk on
the morning of September Bth, I
showed him the milk I had set on
September 7th. I set the milk
again September Bth, and that was
also spoiled by early morning.
And on the 9th I showed him the
milk, and told him that if he would
shut his cows off of the marsh in
another pasture I would give him
two cents a can more for his milk.

On this morning, the 9th, we had
some words about the milk, and he
went away without the can. The
milk that Nunez brought on the 9th,
and which was delivered the same
day to customers who had never
had any of this milk before, made
nearly all of them sick.
Up to this time, I thought that
the milk was nol properly cooled,
and that the cows were eating some
grass or weeds that made the milk
bad; and this is the reason I offered
him two cents more to take the
cows away from the marsh and put
them in a different pasture and
get a new cooler.
I found by asking some of his
(Nunez') customers to whom he
sold milk on September 9th, that it
was all right. This was the same
day that the milk which he sup
plied to me made my customers
sick.
Upon hearing that so many were
sick, I took samples of the milk
and had it analyzed. I am now
awaiting the results of the analysis.
I have told Nunez Bros, to deliver
me no more milk, and have given
them written notice to this effect.
3. I believe my customers will
understand from this statement
the position in which these people
have placed me.
I have had other dealings with
Nunez Bros, and thought that then
reputation would be at stake as
well as mine to deliver me good
milk, but the peculiar circumstance
—delivering me milk on the 9th of
such kind and quality as he did —
came as a surprise to me, for I only
thought before this time that the
fact that his milk had turned sour
on my hands was the result of the
milk not being properly cooled.
When I was talking to Nunez
about the milk turning sour, he
told me that he could get some
thing to putin the milk to keep it
from turning sour. I told him not
to do so; that I would stand noth
ing of the kind.
4. I feel very strongly about this
matter. I believe there is no law
in this State that will give a suffi
cient punishment to any man who
attempts to adulterate milk. I
feel this not only on account of the
injury to my business, but more on
account of injury done to those
who use the milk, and I shall fol
low this matter up and punish the
guilty party.
Edward Loder.
Subscribed and sworn to before
me, this 12th day of September,
1902.

Notary Public in and for the County
of Santa Clara, State of Califor
nia.
