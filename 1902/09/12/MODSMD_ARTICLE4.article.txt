# TRAINING-HOUSE FINANCES.
## Status of the Organization Explained.â€”Report of Secretary Taylor. 
### 
The third annual meeting of the
Training-House Corporation took
place Wednesday, May 21st, of this
year, at room 10 of thequad. The
condition of affairs of the Corpora
tion was found to he very satisfac
tory,the total assets being $3174.38,
with no liabilities. Of this amount
$1400 is safely invested, netting a
return of not quite five per cent; the
balance, consisting at present of
cash in the Bank of Palo Alto, ag
gregating $1774.38.
As secretary of the Corporation, I
have been instructed to write up
this brief statement, and also to
better place before the student body
what the Corporation has accom
plished and what it hopes to do in
the future.
Doctor Angell (the treasurer), in
closing his report, suggests as fol
lows:
"The new gymnasium is designed
to meet most of the requirements of
the Training-House. The matter
of the grounds, however, remains to
be considered. Should the Univer
sity not supply Varsity grounds,
the fund might well be applied to
this end. But should Varsity
grounds be included in the erection
of the new gymnasium, the fund
could most fittingly be applied to
filling a pressing want in the Uni
versity: viz., supplementary fields
for the second and third teams,
class, fraternity and club games."
This expresses the opinion of the
directors of the Training-House
Corporation, save that they desire
to add that the maintenance and
constant care of all fields and out
door property of the student body
might be very properly undertaken
even if supplementary fields are
provided.
In other words, the Corporation
with the income now at its disposal
(both from the student body and
from its invested money) could
guarantee a high standard of excel
lence for the grounds, and at the
same time have them ready at all
times for use without any additional
drain on the student body, and
spasmodically, as is now thecase.
That is, grounds being once provid
ed they will not deteriorate in qual
ity because of neglect in caring for
them.
Then again, improvements might
be made from time to time at the
suggestion of the Associated Stu
dents and without being delayed
because of a lack of funds in the
student body treasury.
Only a word need be said as re
gards the work that the Corpora
tion has accomplished. This work
has consisted rather in its influence
as a result of the evidence of the
good will of the student body at
large toward the University itself
than in any real activit}' on the
part of the Corporation. We have
not taken any decisive action, be
cause there could not be such action
with so small means at our dis
posal. In other words we have
been waiting until such time as our
assets might aggregate no less than
five thousand dollars before plan
ning any actual movement toward

securing a training-house and ap
purtenances.
Under these circumstances it is
the more gratifying to learn, though
unofficially, that the management
of the University has been appreci
ative of the efforts of the students
to secure necessary training quar
ters for their athletes, and that the
announced decision to incorporate
such training quarters with the
new gymnasium has been, at least
partly, a result of the formation of
the Training-House Corporation.
In closing it is well to mention
that before adjourning last May it
was decided to lend any amount of
money, not in excess of $1700, to
the Associated Students at five per
cent interest, whereas now a rate of
eight per cent has to be paid the
banks whenever it is necessary (as
at present) to negotiate a loan.
Such loans will of course be for
short terms and on properly en
dorsed notes as security.
Respectfully submitted,
Henry H. Taylor.
