# A 						UNIVERSITY OF RESEARCH
## A 						Suggestion from England Concerning the Work that Should be Done at Stanford. 
### 
An interesting suggestion is made
in Science of August Bth, by Mr. Al
fred C. Haddon, of Cambridge,
England, as to the peculiarly fortu
nate position of Stanford Univer
sity as an institution for advanced
study. The article, which is enti
tled "Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity—A Suggestion," reads:
"At the outset may I assure my
readers that I make no pretention
to a knowledge of all the local
conditions. I write merely as a
casual traveler, but one who is
greatly impressed with the pros
pects of California from a non
material point of view.
"When I paid a hurried visit to
Palo Alto last November, I felt
what a splendid opportunity there
was for a new departure in the
history of universities. Nicely sit
uated in a beautiful country, enjoy
ing a fine climate, with buildings
of an interesting style of architec
ture, and with a princely endow
ment, the possibilities are very
great. The well equipped univer
sity near the largest city of the State,
which is only some thirty miles dis
tant, is quite capable of supplying
the academic needs of the State for
some time to come. There does not
appear to be, therefore, any press
ing need for the foundation of a
new university on similar lines to
that of the State university.
"Supposing the university au
thorities resolved not to do any
university teaching, say for fifty
years, but decided on making it a
home for all kinds of research, what
might not be the benefit to learning
in general and to the State in par
ticular? If the most able investiga
tors and scholars were enticed to
make Palo Alto the centre of their
labors there is no knowing what
good might result.
"Research first and foremost
should be its watchword, and stu
dents should be trained 6olely for
research, whether in humanities or
in science. The geographical posi
tion of California suggests some of
the main lines of research—all that
is in or around the Pacific Ocean.
As the greatest part of the research
could be conducted most profitably
at various spots within this area, so
the course of instruction, or rather
the direction of the research,in any
subject, would be undertaken where
ever the professor happened to be.
For example, the professors of geol
ogy, botany, zoology, and anthro
pology, with their students, might
make investigation from Kam
chatka to Australia.
"The ordinary European acade
mic mind would stand aghast at
the upsetting of traditional meth
ods, and would say promptly that
even supposing such a scheme were
in any way desirable, it would be
unworkable.
"Personally, I believe it would
be most stimulating and valuable,
and I have no doubt that American
wits could devise a workingscheme."
