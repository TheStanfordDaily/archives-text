It is a curious and melancholy
situation that finds Nineteen
hundred-and-six, the largest class
that Stanford has known, repre
sented on the football field by the
smallest squad that ever came out
for a freshman team. No factor
has more to do than competition
in determining the outcome of the
season, yet here we are trying to
make a start with barely enough
players to form two elevens. The
circumstance is embarrassing to
the coach and annoying to all of
us. That Naughty-six is really
lacking in material, that she can
not turn out thrice the present
number of candidates, that she can
leave any path untrod that leads
to success in the coming match
with Berkeley, are matters beyond
our belief. Can it be that members
of the class are ignorant of the
situation which we face this year, a
situation in which they figure so
conspicuously? Do they not know
that every class now at Stanford
has won its freshman game, and
that a cloud will hang overNaughty
six its entire four years if it fall
short in any way of honestly at
tempting to perpetuate this record.
Naughty-six has dozens of husky
fellows who can and ought to be on
the gridiron. Their services have
been called for, and it is for them
to respond.
