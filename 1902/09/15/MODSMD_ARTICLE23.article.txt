Friday evening, in the club-room
of Encina Hall, the members of the
Class of 1906 were the guests of
honor at the informal reception an
nually arranged by the Christian

General Secretary Harter, '02,
of the Y. M. C. A. then addressed
the audience. He said in part:
"Along with the Registrar,the Book
store, the Inn, and Mr. Adderson,
who have been taking you in with
a glad hand, the Young Women's
and Young Men's Christian Associ
ations extend a welcome to you
also. We welcome you to the op
portunities for self-culture in the
arts of living and thinking that
only a university can afford; to
the opportunity of developing
moral backbone and intellectual
muscle; to the riches of personal
friendship."
President Jordan spoke in a
jovial tone to the new students.
"Come here —take everything," he
said, "The Hall, campus and trees
are yours; the professors are
yours—make the best of them.
Watch your major professor, see
bow he does it; get acquainted;
make the professors work; get
everything from them, and by and
by when you have exhausted the
possibilities of Stanford you can
oome back to Stanford and see
what you've missed."
Byrne, '05, was heard in alaugh
eble monologue; and the festivities
w«re brought to a close by the
singing of "Hail, Stanford, Hail,"
by the entire gathering.
