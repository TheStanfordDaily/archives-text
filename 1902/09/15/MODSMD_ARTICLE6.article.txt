# SUNDAY SERVICES BEGUN.
## Dr. Murray Delivers Thoughtful Address in the University Chapel. 
### 
Those who attended the chapel
service yesterday morning had the
privilege of hearing Mrs. A. W.
Smith, after an absence of more
than fifteen months from the Uni
versity, sing "O Ye That Love the
Lord," from the oratorio "The
Lord is King," by Burnley. Dur
ing the past year Mrs. Smith has
been singing in oratorios in New
York.
The sermon yesterday, given in
thoughtful, earnest, and direct
manner, was by Dr. A. T. Murray,
who spoke of worship and prayer,
and one's attitude toward God. He
said that worship should be waiting
upon the Lord, or it is in vain.
There are people who have no sense
of God's nearness, and those who
find the thought of God's presence
one of disquietude. Such men can
not worship and pray and feel that
God hears. The opposite of the
view finding the idea of God's
presence one from which we would
flee, is that of the higher aspira
tions of the Jewish religion.
New revelations are needed today
that God is not an abstraction, that
walking with God is not a mere
echo from Old Testament thinking.
Man's purpose in life is not prima
rily to seek for comfortable things,
joy and peace; it is to do the right,
—which, however, secures joy and
peace. "They that wait upon the
Lord shall renew their strength."
In the crises that come into onS's
life, it is a source of strength to
consult God. The strength enables
one to do the duty that lies near
est, to bear the burden that rests
upon us, to resist the temptation
that is at hand. Those who have
sought to live with God have
known more than mere help over
difficulties. They have come under
hallowing influences, which is the
true idea of prayer. Prayer is not
to deflect the will of the Lord, but
to find grace to do His will. The
preacher preaches in vain if he
does not make it easier for men to
see with a spiritual eye. There are
some who worship best in their own
closets, some who worship best in
their daily toil, following the path
of duty. But there is a communion
in worship, an action and reaction
upon one another, a stimulation.
Worship, however, does not mean
to live godly lives one day in seven,
and to lead worldly lives on the
other six. It is a privilege, how
ever, to draw together once a week
to hear words of prayer and to sing
praises, to wait with others upon a
common God.
