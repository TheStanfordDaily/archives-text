# ENCOURAGING PRACTICE.
## Freshmen Engage in Their First Scrimmage.â€”Varsity's Snappy Signal Work. 
### 
The football practice last night
was encouraging in the extreme.
Nearly seventy men appeared on
the held, lluskey, the hig man
from Texas, was out, as was VVright,
a giant, new to the game, hut giv
ing every promise of developing
into a successful player. The two
freshman teams lined up for the
first scrimmage of the year. The
game they played was fierce and
hard. As the heavy hacks pounded
the low-crouching lines, the men
strained forward to check the on
coming rush as fiercely as though
there were some heavy stake in
sight. On each of the teams the
hack field was by far the most pow
erful part, neither line being able
to stop the rushes of the other side.
Estes, Spencer, and Magee took the
hall straight through for distance
time after time, and when Slaker
gave the ball to the other team,
starting from the kick-off, they
carried it to the goal. Bounds of
Santa Clara played a strong, hard
game at halfback.
As soon as the men have played
together for some time the line will
undoubtedly he stronger, as it is
heavy and does not appear to lack
experience. The men lined up as
follows:
Magee I h Sheehy
Mcintosh q Morrisey
Porter 1 e Toothaker
Scofield 1 t Lewis
Christy 1 g Kerns
Nissen, '05 c Shine
Flanders r g Paine
Cheadle r t Cothrin
Dudley re Cruzan
Spencer r h Hounds
Estes 112 h Bogle
The Varsity candidates ran
through signals under the eyes of
Captain Lee, while Assistant Coach
Slaker was taking care of the fresh
men. A decidedly more encourag
ing number of men were out than
in the past. The candidates were
not played in their position for any
lentil of time, but as soon as they
had been given a chance were dis
placed by some one from the crowd
of players hanging with watchful
eyes on the edge of the eleven.
There was a spirit and a go about it
which hitherto has been lacking.
The men were quick in their move
ments and quick to understand
words of direction or advice. The
personnel of the team was:
McGilvray, Knight, 112 b; Chand
ler, Stanford, r h; Dole, Smith, 1 h;
Bansbach, q; Hauverman,c; Craw
ford, Jacobs, r g; McFadden, r t;
Wilbur, Bartell, re; Montzingo, 1 g;
Stillman, Kennedy, 1 t; Clark, But
