# TRACK PROSPECTS.
## Candinal Supporters May Look For A Successful Lot of Athletes on the Cinder Path Next Spring. 
### 
At the opening of the fall f-e
-mester, it is hard to estimate the
chances of the Cardinal in the
spring track meet. The California
team has been broken up, the
Eastern trip having left most of
their star performers in poor shape,
while many of the old men have
not re-entered college. On the
other hand, the Stanford team re
mains almost intact, Chadbourne,
Tommy McCaughern, and Burton
being almost the only men who
have not re-registered.
Two weeks ago Captain Mc-
Caughern expressed himself as
pleased with the prospect. "If our
freshman class will furnish us as
much material as the Berkeley
freshman class has furnished
Berkeley, I shall have no doubt of
the result next spring." The most
pleasing feature of the situation now
is that the entering class has brought
an unusually large number of ath
lethes from among the preparatory
schools, and also many husky fel
lows who ought to develop into
something good. At present but a
partial list of these men can be
given. Some of those given below
may never don the spikes, and
others whose names are not men
tioned will without doubt within a
year be wearing the big white "8"
for the first time:
Lovell, from the Campbell high
school, who ran the mile last year
in 4:50 2-5; Maynard of San Jose,
who won the hundred and the two
twenty in the Santa Clara County
Academic meet; Wyckoff and
young Henley, from Ukiah; Magee,
from Santa Clara College; Ball,
with a record of 21 1-2 feet in the
broad, from Woodland; Hopkins, a
fast man from San Bernardino;
Turpin, a miler from San Fran
cisco; Stephenson, from Santa Ana;
and Spencer, from Hamlin College,
Minnesota, are all said to be good
performers in their events.
Among the old men who were
not in the University last semester
but who have returned are R.
Hamilton, Beach, and Norman
Dole.
Some of the men will be called
out for fall training next week.
