The chapter from the report of
the Commissioner of Education for
1900-01 dealing with German
instruction in American schools,
has recently been published in the
form of advanced sheets. It com
mends very warmly the work of the
Stanford German department and
Professor Goebel. One paragraph
closes as follows:
"The efforts that tend to the
obligatory German examination
for entrance to college have re
ceived no little support from the
recent international pedagogical
movement toward substituting
modern for classical languages, a
movement which has received its
scientific endorsement by Professor
F. Paulson of Berlin. Such a
radical change in the higher educa
tional institutions is undoubtedly
far off, but in all probability the
compromise will gradually become
familiar which sacrifices the classi
cal 'fetich' on the altar of the com
mon good, and brings German to
the foreground, a measure which
Professor Goebel warmly advo
cates."
