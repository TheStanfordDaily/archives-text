# OREGON WANTS A GAME.
## Web-Footers May Meet Varsity on Cardinal Campus.â€”Contest Would Be Close. 
### 
The manager of the University
of Oregon football team is in corre
spondence with Treasurer Edwards,
looking towards a contest with the
Northern eleven. Negotiations are
still in a state of uncertainty, but
if satisfactory terms can be reached
it is probable the two teams will
face each other on the campus
about the middle of October. The
expense of bringing the men from
Eugene will be considerable, but if
a date can be arranged for a game
on the same trip with the Univer
sity of California, the expenses can
possibly be borne by both Berkeley
and Stanford.
The Oregonians are very anxious
to meet both Stanford and Berke
ley. The game would undoubtedly
be a very close and hard contest.
The web-footers have some fine
material, and they will he well
taken care of by Ralph Fisher, last
season's Stanford captain, who is to
coach them this season.
