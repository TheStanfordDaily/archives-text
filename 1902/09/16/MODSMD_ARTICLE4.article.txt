# No Wisconsin Game.
## 
### 
Recent dispatches from Madison
have stated that the football team
of the University of Wisconsin will
play both California and Stanford
during the Christmas vacation, ar
rangements having been made with
the Western managers for expenses
and a part of the gate receipts.
Treasurer Edwards when seen today
stated that no arrangements had
been made with Wisconsin by
either himself or by Ezra Decoto,
the California manager. In fact,
nothing has been heard from Wis
consin concerning the game.
Neither Edwards nor Decoto will
enter into an agreement to play a
vacation game until after the inter
collegiate match.
