# Success of Cooperative Club.
## 
### 
The Y. M. C. A. has entered a
new field of activity this year.
Following a suggestion received
from members of the faculty, and
assured by the success of a former
cooperative scheme of living, the

association has rented a suitable
house in Palo Alto and procured a
matron and cook. The Associa
tion takes no financial responsibil
ity, but reserves a supervisory
council for the general oversight of
affairs.
The plan of management is very
simple. The members are organ
ized with a president and manager,
and the business is placed in the
hands of a committee. Each mem
ber pays to the matron a stated
amount monthly for the rooms. All
other expenses are defrayed per
capita. That the venture is meet
ing with success is shown by the
number of applications received for
admission, enough having been re
ceived to have filled the house three
times over.
The officers of the club are: Pres
ident, John Miller, '06; manager,
Willard Tvler, '06; auditor, L. E.
Harter, '01.
