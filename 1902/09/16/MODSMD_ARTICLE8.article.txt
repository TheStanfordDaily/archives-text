# Republicans to Organize.
## 
### 
The University Republicans are
beginning to warm up. Tomorrow
night they will hold a meeting to
elect an executive committee, first
and second vice-presidents, and to
further perfect organization. Plans
for the campaign will be discussed
and arrangements made for the
rallies which will be held later in
Palo Alto and San Francisco.
No announcements can be made
now regarding the speakers, but
the club is alive and full of enthus
iasm and expects to have the best
the State Central Committee can
furnish.
One of the prominent features of
the club will be a yelling section
which will be on hand at the rallies
to make a noise. All Republicans
in the University, whether voters or
not, are expected at the meetings.
The present officers of the club
are H. C. Jones, '02, president, and
Arthur Free, '02, secretary. Last
April they attended the State Con
vention of the League of Republi
can Clubs.
Rumors have been afloat to the
effect that Senator Beveridge will
visit the University, hut no ar
rangements to this end have been
made by the club, and if the Senator
comes at all, it will be on the invi
tation of Dr. Jordan and not in the
interests of the party.
