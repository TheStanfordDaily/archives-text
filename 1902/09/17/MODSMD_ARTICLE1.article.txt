# MAKING OF STANFORD MEN.
## President Jordan Delivers Annual Address to Members of Entering Class. 
### 
Dr. Jordan gave a strong, inspir
ing address, on "The Making of
Stanford Men," in the Assembly
Hall last night before about six
hundred students. He addressed
himself primarily to the men of the
Freshman class partly —as he said,
"because he had been a boy so long
himself that he understood the boys
better, and partly because the young
women came here so well prepared
to become true Stanford women
that they did not need advice."
President Jordan said in part:
"It has become the custom here,
as at many other institutions, for
the president to call the Freshman
class together and give them words
of greeting and advice. First, let
me give you a word of congratula
tion. You are the largest class that
has ever entered Stanford. There
are more from the East, and more
from that other East, the 'unmiti
gated East,' which is so far East
that any farther is West, than ever
before. There are more men from
California, for he who has sum
mered and wintered here always
remains, or going away, sooner or
later strays back. This is a cosmo
politan institution. Students on an
average come farther to Stanford
than to any other college, and they
carry this cosmopolitanism to all
parts of the world where it is worth
going. The men from Stanford,
wherever you find them, are mas
ters of the situation, masters of the
work they undertake. They are
young yet, but they have a hand
in the world's affairs. They can
do what they set out to do. They
came here to prepare for effective
ness, not for social prestige.
"In the making of Stanford men
and women California and Stan
ford work together. There are three
things California furnishes—beau
ty, health, and elbow room. There
is not a square mile in California
that is not picturesque, not a square
inch at Stanford that is common
place. All the year round here you
can live out of doors. A house is
here a mere conventionality for
storing books to keep them from
getting wet, and weakness is not a
natural state in California. Elbow
room is a strong factor in building
the character of a man.
"The University furnishes other
things. It furnishes in buildings
all that is fair and fit. The build
ings are growing more beautiful
than any other university buildings
anywheie. The sight of beauty
every day about us takes a large
part in our education. The Uni
versity furnishes books, the store
houses where the men of the past
have put all the best that they have
been, and seen, and felt. The Uni
versity furnishes appliances to en
nable you to find out the truth for
yourself. And finally, the Univer
sity furnishes men with whom you
may come in contact. Stanford has
brought together the best teachers
it can find, men who know, men
who love their work, who have
faith in man and God, who are
loyal to their students, who show

how righteousness looks when it is
being lived.
"Your college course ought to
give you a broad horizon, a scholar's
horizon, and a true perspective. It
ought to give you personal culture,
make you more human, more gen
tle, more lovable. It ought to give
you a certain amount of wisdom,
wisdom to know what you ought
to do, of virtue, courage to do what
you think is right, and of effective
ness. A man who can think straight
and act straight, such is the Stan
ford man. Your course ought to
give you knowledge of the best that
has been thought and done in the
world. Only those who know the
best in the world know it at all.
And it ought to give you something
of method of investigation, of the
knowledge of how truth is won,and
of professional training. All this
you will have little by little, day
by day, in your four years at Stan
ford, if you reach out for what is
offered. We cannot stuff you. We
cannot educate you, cannot make
Stanford men of you, unless you
do your part. I do not say that
there are not men at other univer
sities who could not be distin
guished at first sight from Stanford
men. I do not wish to brag any
more than 1 can help, but you are
to be made here, you are our brand.
"Stanford men have blood in
their veins; avoid all that thins it —
dissipation, idleness, overwork. The
bloodless student, the cigarette stu
dent, is giving way to the normal
man. We hear a good deal about
training rules. The men who do
things are always under training
rules; they never break them.
"To strengthen character, it must
be given play. If a man would
rise, he must have a chance to fall.
So the laws that govern you in life
must be unwritten laws. The Stan
ford laws are mostly unwritten.
They were written long ago. Be a
man and you will never find them
or their penalties; be weak, idle,
rowdyish, and agents of the law
will take you to the edge of the
campus.
"The real thing is growth in fit
ness and strength, character-build
ing. Athletics is not the real thing;
winning victories is not the real
thing. All this is by-play. It is
good in itself to the end of training
and training rules, perseverance
and loyalty, but evil when out of
proportion. The man we would
make has physical force, tireless
courage, gentle manners, a broad
horizon, respect for truth. He
knows truth when he sees it; helms
sound special knowledge; he knows
all there is about something. He
can use his knowledge in doing.
You will be all your life the man
you are when you leave us. Then
leave us a genuine Stanford man —
brave, loyal, capable, glad to live,
work, glad to take up life; and in
all things with a will.

"Your college course ought to
give you a broad horizon, a scholar's
horizon, and a true perspective. It
ought to give you personal culture,
make you more human, more gen
tle, more lovable. It ought to give
you a certain amount of wisdom,
wisdom to know what you ought
to do, of virtue, courage to do what
you think is right, and of effective
ness. A man who can think straight
and act straight, such is the Stan
ford man. Your course ought to
give you knowledge of the best that
has been thought and done in the
world. Only those who know the
best in the world know it at all.
And it ought to give you something
of method of investigation, of the
knowledge of how truth is won,and
of professional training. All this
you will have little by little, day
by day, in your four years at Stan
ford, if you reach out for what is
offered. We cannot stuff you. We
cannot educate you, cannot make
Stanford men of you, unless you
do your part. I do not say that
there are not men at other univer
sities who could not be distin
guished at first sight from Stanford
men. I do not wish to brag any
more than 1 can help, but you are
to be made here, you are our brand.

Dr. Jordan gave a strong, inspir
ing address, on "The Making of
Stanford Men," in the Assembly
Hall last night before about six
hundred students. He addressed
himself primarily to the men of the
Freshman class partly —as he said,
"because he had been a boy so long
himself that he understood the boys
better, and partly because the young
women came here so well prepared
to become true Stanford women
that they did not need advice."
President Jordan said in part:
"It has become the custom here,
as at many other institutions, for
the president to call the Freshman
class together and give them words
of greeting and advice. First, let
me give you a word of congratula
tion. You are the largest class that
has ever entered Stanford. There
are more from the East, and more
from that other East, the 'unmiti
gated East,' which is so far East
that any farther is West, than ever
before. There are more men from
California, for he who has sum
mered and wintered here always
remains, or going away, sooner or
later strays back. This is a cosmo
politan institution. Students on an
average come farther to Stanford
than to any other college, and they
carry this cosmopolitanism to all
parts of the world where it is worth
going. The men from Stanford,
wherever you find them, are mas
ters of the situation, masters of the
work they undertake. They are
young yet, but they have a hand
in the world's affairs. They can
do what they set out to do. They
came here to prepare for effective
ness, not for social prestige.
"In the making of Stanford men
and women California and Stan
ford work together. There are three
things California furnishes—beau
ty, health, and elbow room. There
is not a square mile in California
that is not picturesque, not a square
inch at Stanford that is common
place. All the year round here you
can live out of doors. A house is
here a mere conventionality for
storing books to keep them from
getting wet, and weakness is not a
natural state in California. Elbow
room is a strong factor in building
the character of a man.
"The University furnishes other
things. It furnishes in buildings
all that is fair and fit. The build
ings are growing more beautiful
than any other university buildings
anywheie. The sight of beauty
every day about us takes a large
part in our education. The Uni
versity furnishes books, the store
