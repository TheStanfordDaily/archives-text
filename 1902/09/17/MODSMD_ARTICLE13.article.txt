Among members of the upper
classes there seems to be consider
able uncertainty as to the parlia
mentary procedure by which their
meetings are supposed to be gov
erned. On Monday the Seniors
nominated a corps of officers, and,
there being no competition for any
of the places, they proceeded to de
clare the nominees elected, â€”appar-
ently ignorant of the clause in
their constitution requiring a week
to intervene between nomination
and election. Legally, the lists are
still open; should any one so desire
he can announce himself a candi
date and force the class to a ballot.
Today 1904 repeated the per
formance of the Seniors, laying
itself open to an equal meas
ure of ridicule. In the minutes of
the pseudo-convention of the Fresh
men last week there is recorded
nothing more ridiculous than the
"election" methods in favor among
Stanford upper-class men.
