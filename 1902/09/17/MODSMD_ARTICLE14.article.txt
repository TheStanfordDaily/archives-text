Yesterday thirty-five men com
menced the substitution of football
for gymnasium work. The fact
that the department is willing to
trust the physical welfare of the
men to the trainer and coach,
shows a considerable confidence
in them and in the student
athletic management, and a
large amount of faith in the
good which may be derived from
wholesome competitive exercise.
The attitude of the department is
especially pleasing when taken in
connection with the fact that Stan
ford alone of all the universities
allows credit for athletics. The
wisdom of the system is no longer
an experiment, but has been tried
and found successful. Last semes
ter the track men were excused
some I wo weeks earlier than usual;
this year the same precedent has
been followed with the football

men. It remains for those who are
benefited by this system to do it
justice, to foster the good feeling
that already exists between the
gymnasium department and the
athletic management. There are
some few restrictions put upon the
men doing outdoor work, but they
are without exception advisable re
strictions. Regularity of exercise
is looked to, and the breaking of
training rules means the loss of
gymnasium credit. The attitude
of the department in the matter
is especially pleasing, as it
strengthens the sentiment for strict
discipline in training, which all
well-wishers of our athletics are
striving to foster. The student
body appreciates the efforts of Pro
fessor Storey and his associates in
this matter.
