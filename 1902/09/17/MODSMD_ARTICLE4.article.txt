# Committee Rules on Dances.
## 
### 
Orders have recently been given
out by the Committee on Student
Affairs prohibiting the holding of
the Freshman Glee and the Sopho
more Cotillion in Encina Hall.
There will be only four dances
given in Encina this college year,
two each semester. The Junior
Promenade and the Senior Ball
are to occur at their usual times,
while one dance each semester is
to be given under the direction of
Encina Club. The question whether
the Freshman Glee and the Sopho
more Cotillion are to come off at
all is being taken under advise
ment, but it is probable that the
Roble gymnasium or some other
suitable building will provide ac
commodations for these class affairs,
if it is decided to hold them.
It is the general understanding
that the new decision applies to the
dances only so long as they nre
held in Encina Hall, and it is
probable that when the new gym
nasium is completed all restrictions
as to their number and time of
closing will be abolished.
