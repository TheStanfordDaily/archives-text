# Lively Work on Gridiron.
## 
### 
The spirit shown for the first
time in Monday's practice was kept
up last night. The two Freshman
teams lined up for a lively scrim
mage under the coaching of Pro
fessors Searles and Lewers. Assist
ant Coach Slaker had charge of the
Varsity, while Captain Lee broke
in a second team. The men were
new to their positions and unused

to playing with one another, so that
the team work was not good. The
two elevens ran through signals
with the following men:
Varsity: fb, McGilvray; rh,Tuck
er; If, W. Dole; qb, Bansbach; c,
Hauverman; rg, Jacobs; Ig, Mont
zingo; rt, McFadden; It, Still man;
re, Wilbur; le, Lunt.
Hecond Team: fb, Chandler; rh,
Dorritty,; Ih, Bartell; qb, Knight;
c, Merrill; rg, Crawford; Ig, Ritchie;
rt, Blodget; It, Haywood; re, S.
Dole; le, Butterfield.
