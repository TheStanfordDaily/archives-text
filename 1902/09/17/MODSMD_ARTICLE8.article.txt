# Enthusiasm at California.
## 
### 
The football season has opened
with great enthusiasm at the Uni
versity of California. The rooters
and the band turned out in full
force Monday, and short addresses
were made on the bleachers by
Manager Decoto, Whipple, and
Womble.
Captain W. B. Albertson has
been forced to enter the College of
Pharmacy in San Francisco in
order that he may be allowed to
play on the team this year. This
action allows him to take advan
tage of a technicality that admits
him within the twenty-live day
limit prescribed by intercollegiate
agreement, for the College of Phar
macy opened eleven days after the
academic departments at Berkeley.
The University of California
freshmen defeated the Berkeley
High School yesterday, 5-0, in the
opening game of the season. The
halves were short and the men
were shifted about during the game
in order to give all a chance to
play. The playing of both teams
was crude, and fumbles at critical
points kept the score down.
