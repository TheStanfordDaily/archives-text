There are problems connected
with the financial management of
the college publications which are
never thought of by a great major
ity of either students or members
of the faculty. One of these is that
of advertising. The Daily Palo
Alto is a student body enterprise,
and should receive the cooperation
of members of the student body in
every way that will tend toward
making it successful. Every busi
ness man expends yearly a certain
amount of money in advertising;
and if a part of his trade is given
to the student body it is eminently
fair for the members of the student
body to give the advertisers the
preference when all other things
are considered equal. We believe
that we are in a position to give an
advertiser a large return for his in
vestment. The Daily Palo Alto
is not an object of charity, and
should not be so considered by any
one, least of all by our readers. As
a mere matter of principle, we ask
a closer inspection of the advertis
ing columns. A more consistent
and conscientious consideration of
the problem will go a long way
toward keeping the student body
publications on a firm basis.
