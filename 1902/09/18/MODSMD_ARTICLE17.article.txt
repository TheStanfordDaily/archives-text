In another column appears ail
announcement from the president
of the Intersociety Debating
League, stating that the Freshman
Society will he organized tomorrow.
The call should bring to the
front every member of Nauglit-six
who intends to develop himself in
public speaking while at Stanford.
For two years past, ever since it
was voted to bar first-yoar stu
dents from membership in the
older organizations until after the
Freshman-Sophomore debate, there
has been no more potent factor in
debating at Stanford than the
Freshman Society. Organized as

an experiment, it was from the out
set a distinct success, and when in
spring of its first year three of its
members defeated the Sophomores
in the Interclass contest, all doubt
as to its permanency disappeared.
Last season Naught-five was repre
sented by a trio from the class organ
ization. In the light of these facts,
it would seem unnecessary to do
more than announce the meeting
of tomorrow afternoon. Successful
college debaters are those whose
effort dates from the first semester
at college. The time for beginning
is now, the place the society about
to be organized by Nineteen Hun
dred and Six.
