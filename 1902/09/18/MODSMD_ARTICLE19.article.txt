The following resolutions were
drawn up by a committee of the
Class of 1904 this afternoon:
Whereas, God in his infinite
wisdom has seen fit to remove from
our midst our friend and classmate,
Theodore Goodman Hosmer, and
Whereas, The sorrow which
thus falls upon his family is in no
small measure visited upon us ;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That we desire to ex
press to them the e√üteem and the
respect in which he was held by us
for his true manliness and the dig
nity of his character; and, be it
Jiesolved, That we extend to them
our heartfelt sympathy in this hour
of bereavement, and we commend
them to Him who alone can com
fort and aid; and, be it further
Resolved, That a copy of these
resolutions be spread upon the rec
ords of this class, and a copy be
presented to the family of the de
ceased.
