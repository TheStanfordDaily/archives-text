# Waiting for Church Dedication.
## 
### 
The Rev. Dr. R. Heber Newton,
pastor of the Memorial Church, is
still in New York and will remain
there until the new Church is en
tirely finished. His arrival at the
University will be timed entirely by
the appearance of the mosaics that
are to go over the side entrances.
These have left Italy, and are
thought to be on the water now.
It is Mrs. Stanford's intention to
have every inch of work in the new
building completed before the edi
fice is dedicated. As things now
look, the ceremonies ought to take
place some time in November. The
carving of the figures and inscrip
tions on the walls is progressing
rapidly.
