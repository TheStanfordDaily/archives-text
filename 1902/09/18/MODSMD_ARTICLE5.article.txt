# Festival Choir Rehearsal
## 
### 
The Festival Choir will rehearse
for the first time this semester to
morrow afternoon in the chapel.
Most of the last year's music will
be gone over a few times for the
benefit of the new members. Di
rector Scott Brook is very desirous
that all students, old and new, who
can sing should join the Choir.
Last year there were about one
hundred twenty members, but Mr.
Scott Brook would like at least
one hundred fifty this season, so
that the Choir may make a show
ing at the dedication exercises of
the Church. New pieces will be
rehearsed immediately and prac
ticed for future use as well as for
dedication.
