# More Statues for Library.

### 
Two life-size marble statues rep
resenting Washington and Lincoln
arrived at the University today,
and will be mounted at once on the
pedestals at the foot of the marble
stairs in the Library building.
Both are the work of Antonio
Frijli, the famous Florentine sculp
tor, and are a part of the consign
ment received the first of the week.
