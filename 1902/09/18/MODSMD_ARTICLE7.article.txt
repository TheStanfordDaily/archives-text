### 
At the business meeting of the
Young Men's Christian Association
last night the resolution, "Re
solved, That the Leland Stanford
Junior Y. M. C. A. become self
supporting except for unsolicited
freewill offerings,'' was carried by a
unanimous vote. The business ses
sion was prefaced by remarks by
Dr. Jordan on "The Possibilities
and Probabilities of the Stanford
Y. M. C. A.," —remarks pithy, to
the point, and of live interest to
young men. Herbert F. Coolidge,
'03, chairman of the Finance Com
mittee, then submitted the above
resolution. The reasons urged for
its adoption were: First, that an
organization is like an individual,
in that to be self-respecting it must
be self-supporting; second, that the
scattered responsibility for the
maintenance of the Association is
a disintegrating factor; third, that
the sacrifice of time and money by
the members is justifiable in that
the work at the University is
among strong men, men who should
be led to do what they can to make
the world a better place to live in.
After the resolution was passed
it was moved that the men
be given a chance to subscribe,
with the result that the members
present pledged $165.50 toward the
maintainance of the Association.
For the convenience of the men
from whom subscriptions and mem
bership fees were due, it was ar
ranged that J. S. Burcham, O. C
Spencer, 11. 15. Hummel, and 11. F.
Coolidge should carry receipt-books.
