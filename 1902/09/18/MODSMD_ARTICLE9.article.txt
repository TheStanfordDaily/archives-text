# Football Men Active.

A lively scrimmage between the
first and second Freshman teams
made last night's football practice
decidedly interesting. With the
Varsity and the second eleven
running through signals at one end
of the gridiron, the freshmen
struggling like veterans at the
other, and the bleachers now watch
ing in interested silence, now shout
ing in enthusiastic applause of
some skilful play, the field was a
scene of life and activity. The
freshmen played good, snappy ball.
They fumbled a little, and occa
sionally some one would break
through the line or circle the end
for a big gain; but on the whole the
line seemed much stronger than
before. Magee and Estes showed
up very well for the first Freshman,
Morrissey, quarter-back on the sec
ond team, received a yell from the
bleachers for a lusty thirty-yard
run. The play was hard and full
of life and snap throughout the
practice.
