# A
						WEEK OF EOOTBALL.
## Outlook on Gridiron as Affected by Recent Practice.—First Varsity Scrimmage. 
### 
The football outlook for both
Varsity and Freshman is more en
couraging than it was a week ago.
The past few days have shown, in
spite of the scarcity of Freshman
candidates, that there is a wealth
of good material from which to pick
a winning team for '06. The back
field is unusually strong. Magee
at half is an effective punter, and
his bucks are strong and hard.
Estes, who has been playing at full
back during the past week, is a
hard and heady man. Bounds
and Spencer are fighting for the
other position, with the possibility
always in front of them that Shee
hy, who is playing a strong defen
sive game on the second Freshman,
may win from either of them.
The line men are not so good as
the backs. The second Freshman
team has made its distance time
after time in practice, but after the
team work is better developed this
fault should soon be remedied.
The play is snappy and spirited,
and although the team work is very
ragged in spots and there is too
much fumbling, the outlook for a
strong Freshman team is good.
Assistant Coach Slaker has had the
Freshman candidates in charge.
He has been successful in getting
them to overcome their lack of con
fidence.
Like that of the Freshman, the
Varsity backfield is much stronger
than the line. Bansbach is prac
tically sure of the quarter-back's
position. He is quick and certain
and experienced. McGilvray at
full is showing up well, particu
larly in punting. VV. Dole, "Pie"
Smith, Tarpey, and Tucker, are be
ing tried at halfback. Smith has
played against Berkeley three
times in this position. Tucker has
never played football at Stanford
before, but seems to be a strong
man. For ends there are in the
field Clark, Bartell, Wilbur, Butter
field, Hamilton, and Cooper. Mc-
Fadden, Stillman, and Kennedy
are playing strong games at tackle.
The guards are the positions about
which there is the least surety.
Crawford, Jacobs, Montzingo, and
"Guiby" Dole are possibilities, but
no one has shown up so strong as
to be sure of a position. Hauver
man, who has been playing center,
is easily the best man on the field
at this position, except Captain
Lee.

The Varsity lined up for the first
time last night. In spite of the
fact that this was the first scrim
mage of the year, the team work

was fairly good. With the ball
the Varsity made a better showing
than when on the defensive. The
line of the second team could not
withstand the plunge of the Var
sity. On the defensive the team
work was not so good, but taking
everything into consideration, the
line held fairly well.
