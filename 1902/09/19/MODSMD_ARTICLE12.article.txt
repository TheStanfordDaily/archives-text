The appeal for old books, made
by Professor Mary Roberts Smith
to the students of the University,
is not being responded to as the
cause deserves. The books which
she is endeavoring to collect are in
tended for the library of the Broad
way jail in San Francisco, where
the prisoners confined are especially
well educated and able to appreci
ate theni. The relation of our Ec
onomics department with the char
itable and other institutions of the
Coast, more particularly those of
San Francisco, have always been
of the best, and as a result the so
ciological studies of Stanford in
vestigation have been greatly facili
tated. This kindly relation has come
about mainly through the efforts
of the Economics department in
assisting in as many ways as possi
ble those movements which are on
foot in San Francisco for the judi
cious use of charity funds and ma
terial. The object of Mrs. Smith's
present appeal is directly along
this line, and cannot but reflect
very favorably on the University.
The conscientious cooperation of a
larger number of students is cer
tainly advisable.
