The Freshmen will meet St-
Matthew's School tomorrow after
noon, and ae this is the first chance
190G has to show its pluck, it be
hooves the players to enter the con
test with a determination to make
the dust fly. It is for them to de
termine what manner of a begin
ning the football season at Stan
ford is to have. The men have
been put through hard and consci
entious practice, and this fact,
coupled with the good condition
the men are in through faithful
training, has already inspired the
bleachers with hopes of freshman
achievement on October 18th. The
men must be impressed with the

importance of going into the con
teat tomorrow not only with the
hope of winning, hut also with the
determination to pile up a hig
score. The season ought to be
started with a tirumphant victory.
The team must not look upon
these preliminary games as of
importance merely as signal prac
tice for the Intercollegiate. Too
often the representatives of the en
tering class go into these first
games with a listless feeling that it
doesn't cut any figure whether
they win or lose, contenting them
selves with the assurance that
they will play for all they are
worth when they meet California*
It is to he hoped '06 will view the
situation in a different light, and
let the energy which is to mark
its last game characterize its
first.
