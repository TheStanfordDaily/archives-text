### 
Varsity practice at the Univer
sity of California is attracting
more attention than usual this
year, and the bleachers are filled
with enthusiastic rooters. The
coaches are hard at work on the
varsity team, and the present line
up is: Hudson, Demerett, and
Gage, ends; Albertson, Middleton,
and Howard, tackles; Stow and
Overall, guards; Stroud, center;
Whipple, full; More, quarter;
Smith, Mini, Sherman, and Graves,
halfbacks. The training table will
be established next week, but no
men will be admitted at first ex
cept those who played against
Stanford last year.
