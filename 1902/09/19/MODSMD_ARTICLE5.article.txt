# EMPLOYMENT BUREAU REPORT
## Many Men Have Been Given Opportunity to Earn College Expenses. 
### 
The men's branch of the Stu
dents' Employment Bureau has
been unusually active this year,
and on the whole exceptionally suc
cessful. Following are facts of in
terest about its work, obtained
from L. E. Harter, general-secretary
of the Y. M. C. A., who has charge
of the Bureau:
The total registration of men at
the Bureau is fifty-three, exceeding
by four the total registration of men
both semesters last year. The real
service of the Bureau to the self
supporting student is to be seen in
the fact that all but four of the
men listed are new men. The
Bureau's work is to start men, â€”
to give them the first chance to
show what they are made of. The
best men are in demand from the
first, and frequently, if conditions
are favorable, do not have to return
to the Bureau for work.
The men average twenty-two
years in age, and are experienced
in domestic work, indoors and out.
About half of the men register from
"the farm." Twenty-seven of the
number had $50.00 or more upon
arriving, twenty-one had less than
$50.00, and from five there was no
report. Not more than about ten
men are entirely on their own re
sources. Most of the men could
get a remittance on a pinch. Dur
ing the summer there were ninety
personal letters written, in answer
to letters from Nova Scotia to
Central America.
In all, ninety-two applications
have been made for student labor.
Twenty-seven of these places are
permanent; seven are for four hours
or more per day; ten for three
hours per day; and ten for less
than three hours. Fifty-six tem
porary jobs have been assigned,
from one to five hours in length, at
twenty cents per hour. Nine posi
tions have not been filled.
Of the twenty-one men who came
to the University with less than
$50.00, seven have places where
they are working for board and
room. The other fourteen are dis
tributed between the three- and
one-hour places and the Inn.
It was feared early in the season
that the student labor market
would be overcrowded, but not a
man who has needed work has been
idle. The only men who are on
the books today are the men who
cannot find the kind of work they
wish, but are not hard pressed.
One very great feature in the
easing of the labor field this year
is the fact that the Inn is employ
ing forty-three students. All the
figures given above are exclusive of
the Inn figures. The fact that the
pay-roll of the Inn and the Em
ployment Bureau are in the same
hands, has made it possible to
place the men very advantageously.
Of the forty-three men at the Inn,
twenty are new and twenty-three
old. Fifteen of the new men are
registered at the Bureau.
