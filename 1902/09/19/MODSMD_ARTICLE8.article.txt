# Band Tunes Up.
## 
### 
Fifteen men turned out for the
first liand rehearsal yesterday after
noon. Mr. Scott Brook led the
practice, which he pronounced a
very satisfactory one. A few
marches were practiced, and the
Band will play for the first time a
week from Saturday at the Stan
ford-Reliance game.
