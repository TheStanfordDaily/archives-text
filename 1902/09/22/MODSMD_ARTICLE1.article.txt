# ST. MATTHEW'S TIED FRESHMEN
## Naught-six Eleven Was Unable to Score on Preparatory School Team. 
### 
The representatives of the Class
of 1906 met with a virtual defeat
on the gridiron last Saturday at
San Mateo, St. Matthew's prepar
atory school holding them down
to a tie with no score.
The Freshmen presented two
conspicuous faults: lack of team
work caused primarily by poorly
understood signals, and indecisive
play. The score, 0-0, does not tell
the whole truth. In each of the
fifteen-minute halves Stanford car
ried the ball to within five
yards of St. Matthew's goal, but
neither time could the ball be
pushed over. In the first half
holding in the line lost '06 the ball,
and Hastings kicked to safety; in
the second, St.Matthew's, inferior in
weight but showing a spirit and
pluck that the Freshmen lacked,
gamely held the visitors for downs
on the three-yard line. The ball
was kept in St. Matthew's territory
throughout the game, but it was
principally through superior weight
that the Freshmen kept their op
ponents from carrying the ball
straight down the field.
There was little fumbling in
passing the ball, but, with the ex
ception of little Mcintosh, an ina
bility to catch and run in punts
was displayed. When St. Matthew's
had the ball the line held well, but
on the offensive it was repeatedly
forced back so that it interfered
with the backs before they could
get off. The tackles were, perhaps,
the weakest places in the line,
although more effective towards the
end. Behind the line Magee,
Bounds, and Estes carried the ball
well but failed'to give good inter
ference. The St. Matthew's ends
repeatedly broke through and
nailed the*'man behind the line,
when a proper knowledge of the
cross buck would have made a good
gain possible.
In the second half Sheehy and
Bogle displaced Estes and Bounds.
Bogle was always good for two or
three yards, and Sheehy played a
hard game, never failing to bowl
the St. Matthew's end when form
ing interference. Dudley and Por
ter were more successful in the first
half than were Flanders and Webb
in the second, and Mcintosh at
quarter did good work in spite of
his light weight.

The game cannot be called en
couraging, yet the outlook for a
good Freshman team is not of an
indigo tinge. Practice and an ac
quirement of something of the spirit
and dash with which the St. Mat
thew's eleven contested every inch
of the ground, should be able to
eradicate what weakness was in
evidence.
