The Christian Association services
last night were under the leader
ship of Hugh Moran,'o4. Dr. Alden
addressed the audience on the sub
ject, "Prayer, Is It Futile?" say
ing in part: "Unusual conscious
ness of a Supreme Being has led
humanity, even heathen humanity,
to pray. Christ, who, with his pure
life, found occasion to resort to
prayer, taught his disciples to pray,
and bade them teach others. The
grand men who have done so much to
influence thought,among whom may
be mentioned Knox, Calvin, Luther,
Wesley,Washington, Franklin, were
men of prayer, and the testimony
of earnest workers is that there is
no possible excuse for not believing
in the efficiency of prayer. 'Ask
and it shall be given you,' and
again, 'The supplication of a right
eous man availeth much.'"
