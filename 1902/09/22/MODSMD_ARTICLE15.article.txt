The mediocre showing made by
the Freshmen in Saturday's game
was entirely in keeping with the
initiative games of freshman teams,
and is not to be taken in any way
as a token of discouragement. The
men have to get used to each other;
they have to develop team work;
they have to experience that feeling
of confidence, each player in him
self and his teammates, which goe√ü
a long way toward the winning of
any athletic contest. The game
with the California freshmen is
only a month distant, and the ag
gregation has yet a long way to
travel toward perfection. But the
men are hard workers and willing.
Under the direction of the coaches
they will develop. All that is
necessary is that they knuckle
down to business, get as much out
of daily practices and the prelim
inary games as possible, and enter
the final contest with the deter
mination to win. These things
done, the youngsters will return
from their tussle with California
with as many laurels as it is fitting
for freshmen to wear so early in
the year.
