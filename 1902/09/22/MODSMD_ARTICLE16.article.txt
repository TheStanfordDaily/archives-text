feeling of a majority of the student
body—that the Varsity yell has
retrograded to such a degree as to
be almost unrecognizable to per
sons who have heard it given prop

pioneers there would be a justifica

our predecessors. But instead of a
more forceful slogan we have had
for the past three years an indis
tinguishable volume of sound in

rendered indistinctly.
The fault does not lie with the

present yell leaders —it antedates
them, and they have been following
the method of delivery which has
been handed down to them. The
rooters, each and every one, must
make it a personal duty to learn
the yell as it should be given, and
to support the efforts of the leaders
in their attempt to bring it up to
its former excellence.
