# SPANISH IS POPULAR.
## Unprecedented Enrollment in Prof. Ramsey's Classes.â€”Changes in Courses. 
### 
The registration in Elementary
Spanish (Romanic Languages, 10)
was closed early last
the two sections reached the respec
tive totals of 60 and 80. A num
ber of applicants were thereby
prevented from entering the class.
This enrollment of 140, as com
pared with last year's total of 122,
is all the more remarkable in that
this year the students in Elemen
tary Spanish are drawn almost en
tirely from the class of '06, whereas
last year fully one-fourth of those
beginning the study of Spanish
were upper-classmen. Professor
Ramsey estimates that, if suitable
accommodations could have been
provided, four sections of 40 each
could have been formed this year.
The second-year class is nearly
three times as large as that of last
year.
The teaching force has been
strengthened by the appointment
of Wesley 11. Long, a graduate of
the University of Boston, as assis
tant, and by the assignment of C.
G. Allen to one of the sections in
Elementary Spanish.
Several important additions and
changes have been made in the
courses offered. The second-year
grammar and reading course three
hours (given last year as "Modern
Spanish") has been re-arranged by
subdivisions into two courses:
Spanish Syntax and Modern Span
ish Reading. The course in Con
versation has been extended from
two to three hours weekly, and the
work is conducted this year On the
laboratory plan, no outside study
being required. A lecture course
in Spanish Literature is given and
also a course in Spanish Themes,
designed for advanced students
who are qualified for original
composition and are desirous of ob
taining instruction in Spanish
rhetoric and criticism of style.
