Editor Daily Palo Ai.to:—
At the opening of an athletic
season whose prevailing spirit is so
commendable, it may seem out of
place to offer any suggestion that
may he construed into unwarranted
criticism. But I feel that some
one, before it is too late, ought to
take the initiative in forcibly pro
testing against the manner in
which the Stanford yell is being
maltreated on the"-bleachers. As
given at the practices this year, it
seems to many of us to have neither
character nor force; to be, in fact, a
pitiable imitation of the slogan in
which we used to take so much
pride. In an effort to gain speed,
every other attribute of the yell has
been lost sight of. The eight reso
nant "rahs" have degenerated into
three rasping gasps, painful alike
to the throat of the rooter and the
ear of the listener. Ido not favor,
Mr. Editor, taking our cue in
everything from the records of the
past, but it would appear that the
liberties winch have been taken
with the yell propagated by the
alumni have been unwarranted by
any demands of sense or circum
stance. Bleacherite.
