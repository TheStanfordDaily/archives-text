# TO BEGIN TRACK WORK.
## New System of Fall Training Will be Inaugurated in Connection with Gymnasium. 
### 
This week Captain McCaughern
of the track team will, in connec
tion with the gymnasium depart
ment, inaugurate a system of fall
training on the oval which promises
to become a feature of Stanford's
athletic development. Hitherto no
regular systematic fall work has
been indulged in. The men will
substitute on the track for gym
nasium apparatus work, the regu
lar drill going on as usual. This
will allow about twenty minutes
daily work, which at this time of
the year is all that "Dad" Moulton
and the captain deem advisable.
Owing to the fact that much of
his time is taken up with the foot
ball men, the trainer will be able
to do but little coaching until the
close of the football season. The
men will be divided off in squads,
according to the events in which
they are interested, and putin
charge of some of the old men.
McCaughern will take charge
of the sprinters, Dole of the pole
vaulters, and Holman of the mile
men. Those men who are not reg
istered for gymnasium work may
appear on the track for instruction
as do the others. Training rules
will be enforced.
The coach and captain are plan
ning a fall meet to take place some
time after the last football game is
played. If no meet with an outside
team can be arranged a handicap
field-day, similar to the one held
last fall, will be substituted.
