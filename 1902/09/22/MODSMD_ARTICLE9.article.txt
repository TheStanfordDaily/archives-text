### 
The service in the chapel yester
day morning was conducted ac
cording to the Episcopal ritual.
Dr. Jordan read I. Samuel 12 and
Luke 13. Dr. James B. Neis of
Brooklyn spoke on "The Buried
Cities of Palestine," giving many
interesting facts gleaned from his
explorations in the Holy Land and
elucidating the fact that the coun
try is intensely interesting for sci
entific and historical reasons, as
well as for its religious significance.
Fourteen years ago, he said, the
Telemana tablets were discovered.
They are letters in Babylonian
script of the Egyptian rulers to the
Parsees, showing that 'the country
had been under Babylonian rule,
and confirming the old claims of
that nation that they ruled from
the Persian Gulf to the Mediterra

nean Sea, or, as they put it, from
tlie rising to the setting sun.
American enterprise made the
discoveries of these ancient tablets.
Other explorers had dug down from
ten to twenty feet, finding nothing
important; but the expedition sent
out by the University of Pennsyl
vania dug down one hundred and
twenty feet, and discovered over
sixty thousand tablets, dating back
to 2000 B. C.
It remains for the man with the
spade to explore the antiquities of
this region. The real past lies
some sixty feet beneath the surface.
In some places there are as many
as eight cities built one on top of
another. The origin of these peo
ple is a mystery. The future will
reveal many things of priceless
value and interest.
