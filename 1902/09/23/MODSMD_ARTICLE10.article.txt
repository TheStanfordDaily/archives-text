# PALO ALTO VS. FRESHMEN.
## Naught-Six Meets High School Tomorrow in First Campus Game. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 the
representatives of 1906 will line up
against a picked eleven from Palo
Alto. The Freshmen will be prac
tically the same men who played
against St.Matthew's laßt Saturday,
although more players will be tried.
Of the eleven from Palo Alto
six were members of last year's
strong Palo Alto high school team.
Jordan, who will play fullback,
entered Stanford with the class of
1903 and played a strong game as
a freshman, but left college before
the intercollegiate contest with
Berkeley. Swain and Stephenson,
the halves, are both players of nerve
and experience. Swain has been
prominent in Palo Alto athletics
for several years past, and Stephen
bou has played on the Santa Ana
high school team.
The match gives every promise
of being close and is certain to be
fiercely contested as the rivalry is
keen and each team desires to estab
lish a reputation whereas yet there
is none. The prospective line-up:
Freshman: Meyers, c; Buelna,
q b; F. Jordan, 112 b; Stephenson,
r h; I. Swain, 1 h; Silvey, 1 g; Lund,
