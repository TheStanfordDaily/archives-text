# Improvement in the Line.

### 
The line of the second team at
last night's practice was weak.
Magee, the freshman halfback who
was tried 011 the Varsity for the
first time, McGilvray, and Dole
broke through repeatedly for four
and five yards. The Varsity line,
however, showed decided improve
ment in form over any previous
practice of the season. "Jacobs, at
left guard, played a hard, gritty
game, which gives promise that he
will develop into first-class material
before the close of the season. Cap
tain Lee took his old position at
center. Crawford, who went into
the Varsity line-up for the first
time last night, did well for a new
man. Stanford, '04, played a good
end on the second team, tackling
hard and accurately. Hamilton of
the backs, was decidedly superior
to his teammates. Tucker, who
played left end for the Varsity on
offence, went back to handle punts
when the second team had the ball,
and Bansbach took his place at
end. Whether or not this arrange
ment will be permanent is hard to
say, as Bansbach seems a little
light to play in the line. As a
whole the line, which seemed weak
at the opening of the season, ap
pears to have been strengthened
very materially during the past
few days.
