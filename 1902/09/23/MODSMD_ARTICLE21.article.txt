The cull of Captain McCaughern
for a meeting of the track team will
undoubtedly he answered by a
larger number of men than usually
turn out for spring training. The
confidence which we have in "Dad"
Moulton and Captain McCaughern
is such that a more successful year
on the cinder-path can be predicted
than it has ever been the lot of
.Stanford sympathizers to experi
ence. Captain, coach, manage
ment, and men will leave not one
stone unturned that will tend to
the insuring of a Cardinal success
in April. The prospects are en
couraging; the track men have
within the past year had lessons of
hard w >rk enforced upon them.
They have seen men with no nat-

Ural ability, with no other athletic
instinct than a willingness to work,
develop into point winners. It be
hooves everyone who can to get
out and try —try to run, try to
jump, try to throw the hammer.
The captain is commencing early,
and rightly so. The rough edges
must be worn off, the men must
learn the game, they must get ac
quainted with their events and
with their teammates. Every
freshman who has not heard "Dad"
talk track should be at the training
house tomorrow evening.
