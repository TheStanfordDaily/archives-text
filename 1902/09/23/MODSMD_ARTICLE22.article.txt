The following resolutions were
adopted yesterday by the Univer
sity Council:
Whereas, Death has removed
from us our colleague, Dr. George
Mann Richardson, professor of Or
ganic Chemistry,
Be it resolved by the Faculty
and Council of the Leland Stanford
Junior University,
That in the death of Professor
Richardson the University has lost
the services of a distinguished
scholar and an inspiring teacher,
whose wise council has been of
great value in the advancement of
its highest interests;
That we have sustained the loss
of a friend, whose sincerity, quiet
modesty, unselfishness, and help
fulness endeared him to all who
knew him, and whose strong per
sonality and sound judgment on
questions relating to academic life
have exercised a powerful influence
upon the University community.
Resolved, That these resolutions
be spread upon the minutes of the
University Council, and that they
be communicated to his wife and
relatives, with the assurance that
our sympathies are with them in
their sorrow.
