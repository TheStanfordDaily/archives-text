The annual report of the Smith
sonian Institute at Washington, 1).
C\, for 1900, has just been issued.
About 100 pages are devoted to an
article on "Anthropological Studies
in California," by \V. H. Holmes,
head curator in the department of
anthropology at the Institute. Fav
orable mention is made of the effort
at Stanford to gather and preserve
the precious relics of the native art
of the state, but the author laments
the fact that there are no curators
employed by the University to
gather these collections who are
competent to give the collections a
standing as scientific material.
In this connection it may be said
that in an address given by Dr. A.
C. Haddeti before the Anthropo
logical Institute in London last
January, and which has recently
been published in Nature, a London
weekly, attention is called to the
very favorable position Stanford
is in for the study of Anthropology.
