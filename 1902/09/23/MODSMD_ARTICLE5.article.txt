# Womens' League Will Meet.
## 
### 
The first meeting of the Women's
League this semester will be held
Friday in Roble. The League
was organized last January at
the suggestion of several of the
professors' wives, with the hearty
cooperation of the women stu
dents. Its main purpose is to
bring together the various groups
of University women in a friendly
way, and on a basis of common
interest. To this end informal
monthly gatherings are held in
Roble Hall, with light refreshments
and usually a very short program.
Last year the attendance steadily
increased, the last meeting, though
held just before examinations, being
the most successful of all. The out
look this year is good. The infor
mal character of these gatherings
will be preserved, so that members
may come freely from laboratory
and class-room in working dress.
