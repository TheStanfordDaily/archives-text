# FRESHMEN TIE PALO ALTO.
## First Campus Game Results in a Draw, Each. Side Scoring- Five Points. 
### 
The Freshmen failed to defeat the
picked team from Palo Alto this
afternoon. Indifferent team work,
a weak line, and poor ends contrib
uted to a large extent to this fail
ure. In the first half Buetna of
Palo Alto worked the quarter-back
trick for twenty-five yards. Swain
followed with an end run for twen
ty yards, and Jordan made a place
kick for goal from the thirty-yard
line. Score: Palo Alto 5, Fresh
men 5. The Freshmen made their
only score in the half through a
fumble of Magee's kick by Westall,
and an end run by Magee. The
goal was missed. In the second
half the ball seesawed back and
forth. Continued fumbles by each
side gave a charming air of uncer
tainty to thef game. Palo Altocame
in strikingdistance of the goal at the
end of the half but Shine broke
through the line and blocked Jor
dan's place-kick. The youngsters
played hard football, but lost all
semblance of team work during the
plays.
