It is a surprising and painful
revelation, often, to find, when
there is occasion for the student
body to unite in the songs of our
college, how few students actually
know and can sing them. Many
of these songs are stirring, and
some of them, such as "One, Two,
Three, Four," and "Hail, Stanford,
Hail," make the alumnus away
from his Alma Mater tingle with
the enthusiasm of undergraduate
days, and bring in review all the
memories and associations of his
Stanford life. It should, in fact,
be a part of the initiation of fresh
men into the ways and spirit of the
place to make them feel that they
can join in the songs as readily
and as easily as in the cheering.
For this reason the rally and song
practice on the eve of two football
games has been arranged for Fri
day evening at Encina. There is
nothing that stirs enthusiasm more
readily than its expression in song.
There is nothing that will unite
the men of the student body more
firmly and make the new students
feel that they are now a part of
Stanford, than this coming rally.
