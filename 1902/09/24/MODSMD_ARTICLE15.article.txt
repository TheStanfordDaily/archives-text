We print tonight a list of those
freshmen who have given in their
names to be eent to Berkeley.

There are others who have not
done so. Every reader of the
Daily Palo Alto should make it a
personal duty to carefully look
over this list, and if any candidate's
name is omitted which should be
there, see to it that the freshman
rectifies the matter immediately.
The names must be in by Friday,
as at that time they are to be
passed upon by the faculty com
mittee. The unfortunate circum
stances which have in the past his
tory of freshman teams kept capa
ble, conscientious players out of the
game, have been incurred mostly
through carelessness. Naramore
and Johns were compelled to keep
off the field when '03 lined up three
years ago, not having realized their
position until a few minutes before
the kick-off; and Wilbur, who cer
tainly deserved his position last
year, was forced to watch his team
mates pile up a score from a seat
on the bleachers. It certainly is
time for blunders along this line to
cease. A careful helpfulness from
the friends of freshman players,
and a more careful supervision by
the officials concerned,ought to pro
duce a list which will need no
amendment, and which will not be
the source of chagrin.
