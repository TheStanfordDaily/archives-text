The Macmillan Company of New
York City have recently issued an
edition of a "Syllabus of Lectures
on the History of Education," by
Professor Elvvood Cubberley, of the
department of Education. The
work is one of 302 printed pages,
and contains a number of illustra
tions of old schools, maps, charts,
and statistical tables. About one
fourth of the book is given to se
lected and classified bibliographies.
The work is an organization of a
field in which there is as yet no
satisfactory text-book in English,
and is intended for the use of col
lege classes. The "Syllabus" men
tions the various educational re
formers, but they have been given
a very subordinate position. The
emphasis of the work has been
thrown on what was really done in
the schools, as far as is known. The
evolution of the modern school sys
tems in Germany, France, and
England is treated somewhat at
length, and the closing chapter
traces the European influences
which have most strongly affected
the development of American edu
cation.
