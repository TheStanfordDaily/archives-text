# "Tommy" Code's Engineering Feat,
## 
### 
A remarkable engineering prob
lem has just been solved by
"Tommy" Code, '96, at Dean,
Nevada. The principal drift of two
mines on opposite Bides of the same
mountain had to be united so that
the ore of both might be brought
out together, and thus make a con
siderable saving in operation.
A drift was surveyed 1600 feet
on the vein, and 400 feet vertically;
another was surveyed 600 feet, and
the course turned down the moun
tain a distance of 180 feet. So
exactly were the calculations car
ried out that after a cross-cutting
of 800 feet, including a raise of 80
feet, the error in alignment was
only 2-100 of a foot, and in grade
4-100 of a foot. The success of the
project has attracted favorable at
tention from mining engineers and
surveyors generally. Code was for
four years quarter-back on the
Stanford Varsity, afterwards a
member of the Olympic Club team,
and Coast champion light-weight
wrestler.
