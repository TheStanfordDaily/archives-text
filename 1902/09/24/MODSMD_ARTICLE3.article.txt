# WILL SING AND CHEER.
## Big Football Rally Planned for Friday Evening in Encina Hall. 
### 
An invitation is extended by the
Encina Club social committee for
all the men in college to gather at
Encina at 7:30 Friday evening for
a football song practice, rally, and
jolly-up. The men have not come
together in a body since the meet
ing at which the football players
signed for practice. The meeting
Friday evening will have no formal
program, and will not be a regular
stag. It is expected, however, that
every man in the University, and
especially all those in the Fresh
man class who do not know the
Stanford songs, will attend. Every
one having a song-book is asked to
bring it. The rally will last for
about an hour.
Since the Freshmen play a game
with Belmont Saturday morning,
and the Varsity meets Reliance in
its first contest of the season in the
afternoon, it is confidently expected
that the rally will be a record
breaker in the display of Stanford
enthusiasm. The Band will be
there to accompany, and Leader
Baker of the Glee Club to lead the
singing. The yell leaders will like
wise be present to direct the out
bursts of vocal expression between
the musical numbers. It has been
suggested that every man wear a
sweater, so as not to have his en
thusiasm hampered too much by
more conventional forms of dress.
