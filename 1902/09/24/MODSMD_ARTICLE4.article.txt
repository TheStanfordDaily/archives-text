# Hard Scrimmage for Varsity.
## 
### 
The scrimmage between the Var
sity and second team last night
was long and hard. The second
team was on the offensive most of
the time, but could not buck the
Varsity line with any consistent
success. An occasional piece of
ragged team work would leave an
opening which the backs were
riot slow to utilize, but as a rule the
Varsity line held well. For the
last ten minutes of practice the
Varsity took the ball. Bansbach,
who had been at quarter on the
second team when it had the ball,
switched to his old position on the
Varsity. The line of the second
eleven was unable to withstand the
Varsity rushes. Lunt was unusu
ally effective at the left end of the
line and never failed to stop any
embryonic runs of the Varsity in
his direction; but on the whole the
Varsity was successful in making
its distance. "Guiby" Dole was
tried in the backfield and Smith
was taken off the end and put into
his old position at half.
The Freshmen were given a hard
scrimmage preparatory to their
game with Palo Alto high school.
