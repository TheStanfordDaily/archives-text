# Preparing for the Library.
## 
### 
Architect Clinton Day has been
on the campus today in connection
with work on Memorial Church.
Mr. Day has under his charge prep
aration of plans for the new
library. These are not yet in a
state of completion, but as soon as
they are accepted and approved by
Mrs. Stanford building operations
may be looked for. It is Mrs.
Stanford's intention that construc
tion of this important addition to
the campus shall begin as quickly
as possible, and as soon as ground
is once broken the work will be
completed with the greatest celer
ity. It is not possible at the pres
ent time, on account of the incom
pletion of the plans, to state just
what style of architecture the new
structure will follow, but it is
probable that it will be classical, if
the architect decides that style of
architecture will prove consistent
with the finish of the outer quad
two or three hundred feet away.
