# PRES. WHEELER'S ADDRESS.
## The 						Head of the University of California Speaks to Stanford Audience on Phases of Philology. 
### 
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler
this afternoon addressed the Stan
ford community in the Assembly
Hall on "The Right and the Wrong
of Language." The appearance of
Presidents Jordan and Wheeler on
the platform was the signal for an
enthusiastic welcome from the audi
ence, and from the rooting section
in the gallery the giving with a
will of the united yells of the two
colleges. Dr. Wheeler's address
was filled with examples of usages
of speech,and throughout he sought
to give the point of view of a living
philologist dealing with the living
phenomena of speech.
President Wheeler spoke, in part,
as follows:
I am rejoiced once again to ap
pear before you in the character of
a teacher and professorâ€”not of a
pedagogue, but as a college pro
fessor. In the latter character we
all meet with many puzzling ques
tions, and none of them more
puzzling than those connected with
language. How shall we pro
nounce, for example, the good
word "envelope"? Certain individ
uals are always very ready to put
us right in all such matters. They
are usually unmarried ladies of a
certain age, and when pressed for a
reason can usually fall back on the
authority and weight of some book
or other. But where does the book
gain the right to speak? And when
the dictionaries fail to agree, what
shall the seeker after a fountain of
knowledge do?
We can gain some light on these
difficult problems by considering
what speech primarily is. It is not
fundamentally the "expression of
our thoughts." Language is born
of the necessity of communication
between man and man. The right
use of language is merely getting
into accord with the best society
about you. The great folk-sense of
speech is an instinctive thing, and
tlie only way to have one's lan
guage right is to get right one's
self.
But the point is that good lan
guage springs from within. The
folk-consciousness from which
springs the vigor of our common
speech does not reflect. The word
and the thing are married to each
other. That protest of the peasant
against the astronomer was rooted
in a true instinct, when lie said
that the astronomer might find out
how far the planets were away from
us and how much they weighed,
but it passed the peasant's compre
hension how the astronomer could
know their names. An Austrian,a
Hungarian, and an Italian were
discussing which of their languages
was the most beautiful, and the de
bate waxed warm. Finally the
Austrian settled the question by an
appeal to reason. Said he, "You
Italians call this," holding up a
glass, "'aqua,'and you Hungari
ans call it 'doda,' but I call it 'was
ser.' Now I not only call it 'was
ser,' but it is wasser"!
Early in life every man child of
us falls from his first estate of in
nocence in language, and like that

other fall, we are led into our dis
comfiture usually by a woman
tempting us with Ihe knowledge of
good and evil. Some schoolma'am
of our early days initiates us into
the blighting lore of an English
grammar, and the heritage of our
speech can never be quite the same
to us again.
But there is a power in the names
of things. It is for this reason
that the Indians will not speak the
names of their dead; that the an
cient Israelite avoided the name of
the Deity. So great is the power
that is held to be in a name that
in one of the Psalms the sum of the
powers ascribed to God is that he
giveth names to all his creatures.
A name will soak up all the sub
stance there is in a thing. The
name "academy" now means a
school, everywhere, but it once
meant merely the grove in which
the school of Plato met. In the
same way the Indian name of a
lake in central New York has come
to mean something entirely differ
ent, and we have Chautauquas in
all parts of the country.
The folk-sense regards language
as an absolute thing. We instinct
ively feel that words have a charac
ter and carry an atmosphere with
them. We think of this character
and this atmosphere as a more per
vasive thing than their simple
meaning, and for that reason hesi
tate to use many words whose
meaning is clear enough. We
might get along with them alone,
but we can't take them into the
family for the long train of associa
tions they bring with them.
