Again we want to urge every-one
to be present at the rally in Encina
club - room tomorrow evening.
When the men line up against
Berkeley on the Bth of November
next those gathered on the bleach
ers wil not be spoken of as "a hun
dred," not as "a large number," but
as "Stanford," for on that day
every man will be there to cheer
and sing, and do everything he
can to encourage the struggling
players who represent the Cardinal.
But the body of partisans cannot
do their duty as rooters without a
knowledge of the Stanford songs
and the Stanford yells. It is for
the purpose of teaching these songs,
these yells, for the instilling of the
Stanford spirit into the Freshman
who knows it not n its fulness, â€”
that the meeting will be called to
morrow. The student body has a
part to play in the contest. Let
us train ourselves as consistently
and as thoroughly as though we
were to go on the gridiron instead
of to seats on the bleachers.
