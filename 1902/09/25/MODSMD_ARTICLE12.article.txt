four men appeared in football togs

and about the same number at
Yalte.
John W. Farley, Harvard '99,
will be head coach at Cambridge
this year. He will be assisted by
ten men who have been closely

than ten years. Farley and Lewis
will take care of the center men,
Donald and Waters will coach the
tackles, Cabot and Cochrane the
ends, Dudley Dean the quarter
backs, Wrightington, Dunlop and
Diblee the backfield, and Percy
Haughton will develop the kickers.

easily puts Harvard in the front
rank this year, so far as coaching
goes.
Yale departs from the custom of
putting in the former captain for
coach, and this fall Walter Camp,
who coached Stanford in '92, '94,
'95, will have the final say. Swan,
