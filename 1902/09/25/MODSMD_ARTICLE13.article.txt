# Oxford as It Is.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I have just received from Mr.
Louis Dyer a pamphlet, entitled
"Oxford as It Is," setting forth each
particular regarding the conditions
of study in the English university
as would interest American stu
dents contemplating possible resi
dence there. Two years ago the
recently established American Club
of Oxford published a concise ex
planation of Oxford conditions, and
it is in the name of this same club
that Mr. Dyer publishes the pres
ent pamphlet, as an attempt to
answer in greater detail, for those
interested in the bequest of the late
Cecil Rhodes, the inquiries as to
practicability of residence and
study at Oxford. The pamphlet is
printed by Macmillan, and sold for
six-pence. Yours very truly,
S. S. Seward, Jr.
