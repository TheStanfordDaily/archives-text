Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Correcting your item in last
issue:
The University Inn Club paid
all bills to the 23d of September
on that date. In order to do this
it was necessary to draw $140 of
the current month's receipts. The
club owns permanent fixtures, such
as linen, silverware, cooking uten
sils, crockeryâ€”and which cost
slightly under $700. The $140
above mentioned should be con
sidered as a debt, as it was money
paid in advance for the expenses of
this week. The net worth of the
Club is, therefore, about $560.
One hundred and thirty member
ship tickets were sold this week,
about fifty 21-meal tickets are in
daily use, and an average of sixty
25-cent meals are also served daily.
Respectfully,
T. W. Strowbridge, Mgr.
