An announcement has been made
that the Pattosien Company of San
Francisco has decided to close out
its Palo Alto store, and to do so at
once and realize an immediate cash
return, the entire stock is to be sold
out at auction, piece by piece.
While the management does not
expect much return, the principal
result sought is a prompt closing
up of the affairs of the branch store
in Palo Alto.
It was only a few months ago
that this store opened and the
people of this community asserted
a pride in having such a magnifi
cent store opened here; now the re
gret is the closing out of the stock.
It will, however, be of some benefit
to our people, in that in all
probability they will be enabled to
buy from the excellent stock of fur
niture, carpets, rugs, draperies, etc.,
something needed in their homes at
prices that they can themselves fix.
