—A clock tower, ninety feet high
and to cost $30,000, is to be erected
at Brown University. The clock is
to be four-faced and will be placed
about two-thirds of the distance
from the bottom of the tower.
—The era of building has arrived
at Brown University. President
Faume in his opening address said:
"Brown University erected six
buildings in the first one hundred
years of its history, six more in the
next thirty-five years. I hope that
she may erect six more in the next
two years."
