# TRACK MEN SIGN UP.
## Moulton and McCaughern Speak to Many Athletes Who Are Ready for Fall Training. 
### 
Seventy men collected at the
training-house last night to hear
what was going to be done in the
way of fall training. Of these
sixty signed up for work.
Captain McCaughern explained
the purpose of the meeting. He
said: "The more work we do this
semester, the better off we shall be
in the spring. I have nothing
further to ask of you than that
you work all you can and as reg
ularly as you can. You will be
put under leaders, each of an
event, who will help you as much
as they can. We want your names
tonight in order to get the 6quads
properly organized."
With three hearty cheers from
the boys, "Dad" Moulton took the
stand. "It is up to the track team
to win," he said. "If we lose the
football it certainly is up to you to
win in track; if we win the foot
ball, you will have to win the track
to keep up with the football men.
Every man who was out last year
can improve; every last year's high
school man here can improve; and
after last season no one will say
that athletes cannot be made out
of what appears to be poor ma
terial."
