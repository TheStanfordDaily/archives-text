# Class Players Must Practice.
## 
### 
Today Captain Lee took occasion
to call attention to the dilatory at
titude shown by those men, not
candidates for the Varsity, who in
tend trying for their class teams.
"It will be impossible," he said,
"for us to allow a man to play in
his class games unless he has pre
viously appeared for practice. Too
often, in the past, injuries have re
sulted from poor condition and
lack of training on the part of the
players. This year the games are
to be serious contests which will
undoubtedly be stubbornly fought.
You may state authoritatively that
no man who comes out for the first
time on the day of the game will
be allowed to participate. The
chances for close, luird-fought con
tests are good, and every man
should help to contribute to their
success."
