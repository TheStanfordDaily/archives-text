# RELIANCE AND BELMONT.
## Hard Games for Varsity and Freshman Scheduled for Tomorrow. 
### 
At 3:45 tomorrow afternoon the
Varsity lines up for the first game
of the season against the Reliance
Athletic Club. Reliance has put a
strong team on the field this season
and should give the Varsity the
hardest kind of a game. The Var
sity line-up will be changed several
times during the game, as the
coaches wish to try out all the best
men. Bansbach, who will play at
quarter in the first half, will give
way to Tarpey in the second, and
Tucker and Hamilton at halves
will take the places of Smith and
Dole after the intermission. There
will be two twenty-minute halves.
Kenneth Hamilton of the Reliance
Club and "Jimmy" Lanagan,Stan
ford '00, will officiate as umpire
and referee.
The personnel of the two teams
will be:
RELIANCE. STANFORD.

In the morning at 10 o'clock the
Freshman team will line up against
the strong eleven from Belmont
School. Coached by "Jimmy"
Lanagan, Stanford '00, this team
has achieved an enviable name for
itself already this season, Lowell
High School suffering a defeat at
its hands last Saturday by a score
of 84 to 0. Although the Fresh
men failed to defeat St. Matthew's,
and succeeded in oniy tying Palo
Alto last Wednesday, by dint of
the hard practice they have under
gone they should manage to defeat
their opponents tomorrow, who are
decidedly their inferiors in weight.
The Freshmen will line up against
Belmont in practically the same
order that they held against Palo
Alto on Wednesday.
