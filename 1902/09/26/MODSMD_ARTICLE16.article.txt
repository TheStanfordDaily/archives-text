The Plug Ugly committee is to
lie commended 011 its endeavor to
have the annual dedication of the
junior emblem as early as possible.
Last year's committee did not get
to work until so late in the semes
ter that the dedication could not
lake place before the first of No
vember. Presumably the celebra
tion marks the passing of the
sophomore into full-Hedged upper
classmanship, and when it is de
layed until a quarter of the junior
year is past some of the innate at
tractiveness of the tradition is lost.
Those who are connected with the
carrying out of the present com
mittee's plans should see to it that
everything is done toward the
hastening of the event.
