# Improvement of a Week.
## 
### 
The football outlook has changed
very materially during the pant
week. Last Saturday the Varsity
was tentative in make-up and
offered no very encouraging out
look either for material or team
work. But a week of earnest toil
has had its effect. Although the
eleven is still far from being what
it should he at this time, the spirit
of the team is good, the men play
together, and they play hard. In
dividual playing, indeed, seems to
have been sacrificed for team work.
The hack-field is beyond doubt the
strongest part of the team when

such men as McGilvray, Dole and
Smith are by no means certain of
heating out other likely candidates
for a position hack of the line.
Kartell, Tucker, Hamilton, Tarpey,
and Freshman Magee are all run
ning hard and putting up a good
fight for a chance to represent
Stanford. Bansbach seems sure to
win his old position as Varsity
quarter-back, but Paul Tarpey is
being tried out at this place on the
first team, while for the last few
nights "Dutch" has been behind
the second team.
With Lunt out of the game there
are left for ends Clark, Stanford,
Wilbur, Butterfield and Nourse.
Should Cooper eome back into the
game there is considerable material
from which to develop two fast,
ends.
The line has shown some im
provement during the last few
practices. At center Captain Lee
and Hauverman, both of whom
played in last year's intercollegiate,
are back in the game. Lee has
been devoting most of his time to
coaching and Hauverman has been
at center on the Varsity, with
Nissen, center on the '05 Freshman
team, opposite him on the second,
liuskey, the giant from Texas, has
heen playing with the Freshmen
during the latter part of the week.
He seems to know his job and
should make a hard fight for the
Varsity line. Crawford, Jacobs,
"Guiby" Dole and Monzingo are
fighting it out for the two guards
positions. McFadden is a fixture
at right tackle, and there is left
only one place on the team which
stands in need of decided improve
ment — left tackle. Stillman, who
played in that position last night,
is not playing Varsity hall, but he
has been shifted about so much
that he has hardly had an oppor
tunity to develop the style of
which he gave every promise last
year.
The game with Reliance tomor
row will show how much real
progress the team has made. But
at the present time, with strong
backs, fairly good team work, and
a line which, if not exceptionally
strong, is at least homogeneous, the
outlook is much more encouraging
than at the first of the season.
