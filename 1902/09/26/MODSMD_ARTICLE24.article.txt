# Progress on Science Buildings.
## 
### 
Work on the new Science build
ings is progressing rapidly. The
Physics and Psychology building
at the northwest corner of the new
quadrangle is ready for the plas
terers.
With one or two exceptions, the
rooms of the large Physiology
building are ready for furniture
and apparatus, but the Natural
History Museum is still in the
hands of the decorators. The plas
tering and decorating in this room
will not be finished within two
months. The remaining Science
building is now completed with the
exception that the stairways are
not finished.
The Chemistry building is slowly
being fitted with stationary furni
ture, such as desks, shelves, etc.
The gas engines are set up and in
running order in the basement.
The stone shelving on the work
desks in the main laboratory is in
place, and the department expects
to move into the structure about
January Ist.
