playing si fierce game at end for
the last few nights, was seriously
hurt during last night's practice.
The cartilage which binds one of
the ligaments in his knee was torn
away during a scrimmage. He
was able to hobble from the field
but an examination showed that it
will be necessary for him to refrain
from using the injured leg for at
least a week. In all probability
he will be kept out of the game for
the entire season.
