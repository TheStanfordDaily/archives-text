# SMITH'S STANDING.
## The
						California Halfback Wants to Be Reinstated as an Amateur. 
### 
Warren Smith, the Berkeley
halfback, who coached and played
with the University of Oregon foot
ball team last year, has through
Manager Ezra Decoto of California
applied for reinstatement to ama
teur standing, at the meeting of the
Pacific Amateur Athletic League
held in San Francisco on Wednes
day evening. Decoto in making
his plea for Smith did not deny
that he had received $450 for
coaching but desired that it be
overlooked, the money, he alleges,
having been for legitimate expense
only. The hoard came to no con
clusion at Wednesday's meeting,
but promised to decide within a
few days.
The clause through which Smith
has forfeited his standing is quoted
in the Intercollegiate Athletic
Agreement. The part covering the
case reads: "An amateur is defined
as being one . . . 'who has not
instructed, pursued, or assisted in
the pursuit of athletic exercises as a
means of livelihood, or for gain or
any emolument.' "
