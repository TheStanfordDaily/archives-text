# CLASS GAME TOMORROW.
## Freshmen and Sophomores Will Settle Their Differences on Football Gridiron. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at four I
o'clock the second-year football
players will line up against
eleven representing the baby class.]
This is the first class football game
for two years, and is the initial 1
struggle this season between the
rival organizations. The contest
tomorrow will undoubtedly be
hotly fought, since the Sophomores
will face the Freshmen with an 1
eleven very little changed from that
which defeated the University of
California 11 to 5 in the inter-!
collegiate struggle last year. 1
Naught-six will be represented by
practically the same eleven that
faced Belmont on Saturday.
