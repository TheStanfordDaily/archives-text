Thosk of us who watch football
from the side-lines have our own
ideas of how a game should be
played. Some of us are never sat
isfied, our natures being that way.
But it is safe to say that Stanford's
playing last Saturday afternoon
was the embodiment of an ideal
which every man on the bleachers
had been cherishing, which he only
half-expected ever to see worked
out. The enthusiasm of the spec
tators, full-voiced though it was,
was but a scant reflection of that
evidenced on the field.
Everyone concerned—coaches,
trainer, captain, and men —is to be
congratulated upon the early de
velopment of a degree of systematic
team-work and generalship which
would do credit to players much
longer together.
