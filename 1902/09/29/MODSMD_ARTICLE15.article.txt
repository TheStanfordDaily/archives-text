Thk initial class game tomorrow
afternoon between the Freshmen
and the Sophomores will present
the amusing spectacle of an enter
ing class without yell, unless some
ingenious freshmen get busy at
once and work up a slogan for
1906. Other freshman classes have
succeeded in getting a yell a few
days after the opening of college.
Yet this organization has gone
nearly four weeks without making
any perceptible attempt at it. It
may be a good suggestion to the
freshmen for them to try to depart
from the type of the yell that has
been much in favor here, and strike
fur originality.
