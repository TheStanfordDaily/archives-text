## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I wish to call the attention of the
members of the '04 Class to the fact
that ()uad assessments are now due
They must be paid before the pho
tographs can be taken, and as all
the pictures must be taken before
December Ist there is no time to
lose. Mr. Donaghho, at what was
formerly known as Peck's studio,
will do the photographing. Ap
pointments must be made with
him before the sittings, and the
receipt for the <lua<\ assessment
must be shown. Appointments may
be made by phone. Mr. Donaggho's
phone number is Black 263. I will
be in room 10 quad from 1 until 1:30
p.m. on Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday to collect assessments.
