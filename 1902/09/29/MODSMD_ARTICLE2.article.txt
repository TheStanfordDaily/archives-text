# Saturday's Game.
## 
### 
Cardinal hopes, which had sunk
to a low ebb Saturday morning on
account of the defeat of the Fresh
men, were sent soaring in the after
noon by the ease and completeness
with which the Varsity vanquished
the heavy players of the Reliance
Athletic Club.
The Belmont School eleven
played as pretty a game of football
as will in all probability be seen
this season on the part of a
preparatory school. Its team
work was excellent and the
rapidity with which the youngsters
started their plays was as pretty a
sight from the bleachers us it was
bewildering to the Freshmen.
Lack of team work lost Naught-six
the match, individual energy and
gameness proving unavailing
against the lighter but unified
Belmont players.
The line, with the exception of
Spratt, at tackle, was uncertain,
holding well at times, and again
opposing a merely nominal resist
ance to the quick rushes of the op
posing backs. The Imckfield of the
Freshmen was their strength; the
ends their most obvious weakness.
If the class of 1906 intends to put
upon the field a team which will
uphold the mark set by other
classes in college, these weaknesses
cannot be eradicated too soon.
The Varsity game in the after
noon presented a pleasing contrast
lo that of the morning. The giants
of the Reliance team were downed
by superior team-work and the
lighting spirit which made the
Stanford team invincible. From
the first ten-yard buck after the
kick-off until the whistle sounded
for the last time, the Varsity liter
ally played the clubmen off their
feet. Cross bucks and end runs
were equally successful, and had it
not been for the deplorable fumb
ling of the Varsity backs, the score
might well have reached twice its
actual size. This was the most ap
parent weakness of the team. Sev
eral beautiful runs that should
have resulted in scores were ren
dered fruitless by fumbles which
gave the ball to Reliance. On de
fense the team played quite as
good a game as when they had the
ball.
Reliance was unable to make her
distance through the line or around
the ends. When the clubmen se

cured the ball on a Stanford fumble
they were forced to kick, usually at
a sacrifice.
The Cardinal line was quick
in offense, played low, and held
well when Reliance had the ball.
Clark and Kartell both played
strongly at end and behind the line
nothing more could have been
asked for had the fumbling been
eliminated.
There were several changes in
the Stanford line-up during the
game: Tarpey took Bansbach's
place at quarter, and Smith went
in at half after Tucker was injured;
Montzingo was displaced at left
guard by Hauverman; and Guiby
Dole took Stillman's place at left
tackle, while Hamilton carried the
ball beside McGilvray after Dole
left the game.
In one way the contest was de
cidedly costly for Stanford. The
victory does not compensate for the
possible loss of Tucker, who played
a remarkable game at half-back.
The ligaments were so severely torn
from his shoulder and the bone
so badly shattered that it is a mat
ter of grave question whether or
not he will be able to appear again
this season. His brilliant end
runs and good interference work
will make the loss one the team
can ill afford to suffer. Montzingo
at left guard had his jaw-bone
broken. There is a great deal of
uncertainty about his recovering
in time to get back into the game.
Should he be kept out for good
there will be a hole in the line be
side the big captain which he was
making a strong bid to fill through
out the season.
