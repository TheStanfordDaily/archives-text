Services were held yesterday in
the chapel according to the Episco
pal ritual. President Jordan read
from the third chapter of Proverbs
and also from the third chapter of
St. John. Dr. Charles Gardner, of
All Saints' Church in Palo Alto,
preached from John 3:1, "Behold
what manner of love the Father
hatii bestowed upon us, that we
should be called the sons of God."
The sermon was on Faith.
Faith, said the speaker, is a vital
principle of life, a spiritual force to
help guide the world. Science is a
struggle to find unity in physical
things; religion is a struggle to find
unity in spiritual things. Credu
lity finds many willing victims in
our age: but credulity is not faith;
superstition is not faith. "Faith is
the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen."
The belief in God is universal
among men. Science corroborates
God: the deductions of science are
drawn from the unknown. The
Book of Job and the Psalms are
great because they express deep
emotion, suit the needs, and express
the faith of man. "Prayer is re
ligion in action." Faith keeps us
from the sins of our degenerate
times.
