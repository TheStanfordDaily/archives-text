Rev. Francis Palmer of the First
Presbyterian Church of San Jose
delivered a scholarly and convinc
ing address at the weekly Christian
Association services last night, on
"Faith: Is It Rational?"
In part he said: Christian faith
cannot be established by demon
stration, but is based on historical
testimony. The credentials of
Christianity are cumulative, not
single, and the evidence of faith is
not only external but also internal
—in mind and heart.
The fundamentals of faith under
lie the belief in the supernatural.
In historical testimony, the char
acter of Jesus Christ himself is the
most noteworthy. Friends and
foes join in praise of him as a man
—a unique character, perfect in de
vout ness and in absence of un wor
thiness. Through the ages Chris
tianity has been the leavening in
fluence. It has brought about
changes in law and order, in forms
of government. It meets the needs
of the souls of humanity.
