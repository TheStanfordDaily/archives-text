The auction sale at Pattosien's
Furniture Store today brought out
most of Palo Alto's residents, as
well as large numbers from out
side the town. It was a busy day
at the store during both the morn
ing and the afternoon sales. The
stock brought ridiculously low
1 prices, considering the fact that the
goods are all of a high grade and
almost fresh from the factories.
it is to be regretted that such an
: enterprising firm as the Pattosien
Co should determine to retire from
business in Palo Alto, but the new
board of directors has ordered the
store closed out, with the purpose
of centralizing the business in the
big San Francisco house.
The management announces that
I the auction will continue daily
until the stock is disposed of, as it
is intended that nothing that can
be sold shall be shipped back to
San Francisco.
