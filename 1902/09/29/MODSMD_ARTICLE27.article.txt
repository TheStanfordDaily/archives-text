# Eastern Football.

### 
Gould, captain of last year's
eleven at Yale, is head coach at
Amherst this fall.
Saturday's scores were as follows:
Yale 40, Trinity 0; Harvard 11,
Williams 0; Cornell 5, Colgate 0.
There are no big gutnes between
tween the Eastern and Middle-
Western college tennis this fall.
The usual Pennsylvania-Chicago
game has been given up on account
of the traveling distance.
