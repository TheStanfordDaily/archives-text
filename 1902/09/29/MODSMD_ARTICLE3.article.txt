# California Defeats Alumni.
## 
### 
California won its first game
against the Alumni, Saturday.
Score, 11 to 0, in two fifteen
minute halves. The collegians
showed up well for so early in the
season, their team work being
fairly good. The Alumni team
suffered from lack of practice but
gave promise of better things later
on. The features of the game were
the punting of Overall, Hudson's
end run of twenty-five yards, and
the all-round work of Muller, the
former Cornell left half-back.
