# Gridiron Still Unchosen.
## 
### 
The football management has
met with considerable disappoint
ment in regard to the athletic field
for the big game. It was intended
to hold the content at 18th and
Dolores streets in San Francisco,
but the owners have now refused
to lease the ground. The only
place under consideration at pres
ent is the Richmond tract near
Golden (iate Park. Car service to
this locality is better than that to
the 18th street grounds, but the
distance is much greater.
