# SOPHOMORES DOWN FRESHMEN.
## The 						Baby Class Defeated by Naught-Five with a Score of Eleven to Six. 
### 
In a game which dragged slowly
through two twenty-minute halves,
the Freshmen were defeated by
their hereditary rivals this after
noon, by a score of 11-6. The
Sophomore team played with al
most the same personnel with
which they defeated the Berkeley
Freshmen last year. Although
showing lack of practice at every
stage of the game, they were able to
push the ball over the line once
during each half. The only score
of the Freshmen was made at the
beginning of the first half, when
they carried the ball from the kick
off straight down the field for a
touchdown. Both teams fought for
every inch of the ground, but the
Sophomores strengthened at every
moment as their opponents weak
ened. Little spirit was shown by
the under-classmen in cheering their
teams, the efforts of the yell leaders
meeting with scant response.
