The Daily Palo Alto is privi
leged to announce the appointment
to staff positions of Miss Annette
Elliott, '06, E. C. Rittenhouse, '04,
W. R. Cole, '05, J. H. Alvord, '06,
S. S. Jewett, '06, YV. A. Paxton,
'06, P. C. Edwards, '06, and J. E.
Campbell, '06, all of whom have
successfully passed the period of
probation demanded of applicants.
The order in which the names ap
pear at the head of this column is
not final, the idea being always to
grade the staff according to the
interest and efficiency with which
the work is done. Merit deter
mines both appointment and sub
sequent promotions. The continu
ance of a name on the roll is a
guarantee that its owner fills a
place creditably and is of direct
service to the paper.
The publication of the list does
not mean that the books are closed
to further applicants. The paper
is in constant need of energetic
assistants, and a standing invita
tion is extended to all.
We urge you to note the compo
sition of the staff; it is the vol
untary and materially unrewarded
efforts of the students whose names
you see there that make this paper
a possibility. If you will you are
in a position to lighten their labors
and double the value of the
paper to the community. If
you have an acquaintance on the
staff, bear him in mind. When
something happens that you think
would be of interest to others, when
you have an announcement, or a
news item or a suggestion, tell him
about it. If you are a member of the
faculty, there are countless ways
in which you can cooperate with
the Daily. Each assistant has
under his charge the news field in
one or more departments.

A little encouragement like the
saving of items for his visits means
much t<> him. The Daily Palo
Alto is an enterprise in whose wel
fare we share equally. Its value
to the University is directly com- j
mensurate with the efforts of itSj
stuff, by whom every token of appre
ciation is gratefully received.
