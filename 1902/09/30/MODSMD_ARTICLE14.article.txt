The suggestion that the Eng
lish Club take upon itself the work
of gathering data reminiscent of
the early days of the University,
compiling and preparing it for pub

a field of useful labor. Coming

tution of learning from the day of
its opening, Stanford's pioneer
years are peculiarly rich in lore
that will become more and more
precious as we find the current
sweeping us farther away from the
launching of the University.
