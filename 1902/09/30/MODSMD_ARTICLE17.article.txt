# California Loses Freshmen.
## 
### 
Colonel George C. Edwards,chair
man of the California faculty ath
letic committee, has submitted a
list of 57 eligible candidates for the
freshman team. The original list
consisted of 72 names, but this was
pruned down to fit the require
ments of the intercollegiate athletic
agreement. Much dismay is felt
among Berkeley supporters on ac
count of this action of the commit
tee, for many of those who were
dropped were certain of making the
team.
Belknap, the star quarter, and
Saben, end, are debarred on ac
count of having played at Dart
mouth last year. Other good men
lost are: Boynton and Johnson,
halves; Reed, Briggs, and Gray,
guards; Tucker, tackle; and Clay,
end. This is the most disastrous
blow ever suffered by a Berkeley
freshman squad at the hands of the
committee.
The list as revised stands as fol
lows: R. G. Arlitt, B. C. Austin,
E. R. Allen, E. C. Bosbyshell, J. A.
