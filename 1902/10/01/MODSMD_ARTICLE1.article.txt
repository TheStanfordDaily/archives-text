# TRAINING-TABLE TOMORROW.
## Failure to Comply With Regulations Temporarily Debars Many Candidates. 
### 
The football training-table will
begin tomorrow at noon. Last,,
year, owing to the fact that no one ;
could be found willing to lease the
Inn, the training-table was tem
porarily established at the Hotel
Alto. The inconvenience to which J
the candidates were putin making i
three daily trips to Palo Alto was)
removed by the courtesy which
prompted the Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity to place its house at the
disposal of the football manage
ment.
Mr. Strowbrige, the caterer of the
University Inn, will have charge of
the table this year, while Trainer
Moulton will outline the diet for
the team. The list of those who
will be seated at thetraining-table
at present comprises only eight
names. The faculty regulation
which prevents any man being
considered a candidate for any
athletic team until he has success
fully undergone a physical exam
ination at the hands of the Univer
sity physician, operates to keep a
large majority of the Varsity men
from the table. Captain Lee can
authorize no man to be placed on
the list until he has presented bis
certificate from Dr. Snow with
the record of a successful phys
ical examination. Those men
who will appear at noon tomorrow
at the Inn are: H. S. Lee, L. P.
Bansbach, W. Dole, C. 1). Hauver
man, C. Tucker, E. A. Smith, E.
Stillman, F. M. Wilbur.
There will be at least twenty or
twenty-five men at the table as
soon as the faculty regulations are
complied with. A list of those who
are delinquent is contained in the
following letter:
Dear Sir: —
The following candidates for
football have thus far failed to pie
sent themselves for the medical
examination required by the Uni
versity of all students training for
athletic teams. Will you kindly
notify these men once more of
their delinquency. After Friday,
October 3d, until such time as the
regular permit is issued, you will
be expected to refuse to recognize
as a candidate for either team, any
one who has not complied with
this regulation.
