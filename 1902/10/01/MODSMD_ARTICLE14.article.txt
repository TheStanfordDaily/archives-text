There is need, a vvofnl need, of
more candidates" for the Varsity.
The caliber of the men who are on
the field, the game which they
play,argues a magnificent spirit,but
the smallness of the number,almost
unprecedented on the Stanford
gridiron, should make every man
who has played football, and is
physically able to go into the game
but has failed to turn out this year,
hang his head in shame for not
supporting the college to the best
of his ability in its time of need.
As an instance of a selfishness
unworthy of Stanford undergradu
ates stands supreme the action of
those freshmen who, as soon as
they found that they were ineligi
ble for the '06 team, refused to go
out on the field again. They do
not seem to recognize the first prin
ciples of class and college spirit.
They cannot see that at no time
have they been working for their
own glory; that intercollegiate foot
ball is not played for purposes of
self-aggrandizement ; that it is a
puny, ignoble kind of a man who
will not at any time do more for
his college than he will for himself.
When the freshmen lined up last
night there were not enough of
their classmen out to form a second
eleven. The showing the team is
to make on the 18th is to be deter
mined by the improvement of the
next two weeks. Hut improvement
cannot come without practice, and
practice without an opposing eleven.
Unless the Freshman attitude un
dergoes a marked and sudden
change, it were the height of rash
ness to predict a victory in the first
of the year's contests with Califor
nia.
