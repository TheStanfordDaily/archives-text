# Whitehouse May Coach.
## 
### 
This morning's Chronicle states
that Louis Whitehouse, a former
Stanford football man, is in San
Francisco, having just arrived
from the Hawaiian Islands, and
that he will come to Stanford to act
as volunteer assistant coach, being

debarred from the position of head
coach because he is not a graduate
of the University.
It is more than likely that White
house will shortly appear on the
gridiron and help in the de
velopment of the team. He played
tackle on the '92, '93, and '94
teams.
