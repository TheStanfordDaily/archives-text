# Freshman vs. Berkeley High.
## 
### 
Friday afternoon on the oval
the Freshmen will line up against
j the Berkeley High School team.
The Berkeley team has played a
number of games this season, and
will undoubtedly put up a hard
fight. Last Saturday they won
from the Polytechnic High School
of San Francisco, and yesterday
were defeated by the Berkeley
Freshmen by a score of 17 to 5.
While little dependence can be put
on comparative scores, the result of
Friday's game will be unusually
interesting.
The Freshmen will go into the
game practically as into the Bel
! Mont match, and as they lined up
yesterday against the Sophomores.
