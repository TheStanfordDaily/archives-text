# Says Athletics Injures Studies.

Professor ira N. Hollis in the
October Atlantic says:"It does not
stand to reason that a student in
intercollegiate athletics can do as
much work as one who devotes all
his time to study. The athletic
season of football, for exam pie,lasts
six weeks in the fall, and so far as
classroom work is concerned, the
time is practically thrown away.
The members of the team attend
lectures regularly â€”they are obliged
to; but their minds are on signals
and plays for the next game or
practice. As a consequence one
fifth of the year is lost, and the
players have to do as much work
in the remaining four fifths as
others do in the five fifths. With
average students it will not be
done. The physical training which
the football men have gone through
cannot under favorable circum
stances increase their efficiency
enough to make good the difference.
Then, as a rule, their participation
in athletics has made them natural
leaders in the social life of the col
lege, and so they lose still more
time. The only point that may be
regarded as established by the
records is that few students ad
mitted to the teams are subsequent
ly thrown off for poor scholarship.
This proves that most athletes can
usually do enough work to remain
satisfactory in their studies. Of
late years a good player has lost
caste if he permits himself to be
disqualified through any fault of
! his own."
