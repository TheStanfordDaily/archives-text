# Planning for Dedication.
## 
### 
Plans are now under way for the
exercises attending the laying of
the corner stone of the new Stan
ford gymnasium. Although no
date has yet been set, the exercises
will probably occur about the
middle of this month. The corner
foundation of the building will be
ready to receive the stone on, or
about, the tenth of the month , and
the date selected will be as early as
possible after that.
The program for the day is to be
entirely under the auspices of the
student body, and is to be carried
out by the students themselves. The
program has been delayed by the
absence from the University, of C.
F. Dittmar, president of the Asso
ciated Students.
The initial raising of the flag
on the new staff at the head of
University avenue will occur the
day of the gymnasium dedication.
