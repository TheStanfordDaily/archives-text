San Francisco, where she will re

New York. Business has taken
Mrs. Stanford away at this time.

at the laying of the gymnasium
cornerstone, but this plan has
been given up on account of the
fact that she will be in New York
for about six weeks. On her return
Rev. Dr. Heber Newton will ac
company her, and the dedicatory
exercises of the church will take
place very soon after his arrival,
probably the first Sunday in De
