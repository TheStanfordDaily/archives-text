Professor Noyes, of the Drawing
department, has just unpacked
some fifty of his paintings. They
are chiefly landscapes, with some
studies from life. Among the num
ber are: New England subjects,
comprising studies of sand-dunes
from Essex and Annisquam, and
scenes from the vicinity of Sugar
Hill; some very sunny subjects
from Cuernaraca, Mexico; and
scenes from Venice. A portion of
these pictures have been on exhi
bition in Eastern galleries, others

are of Mr. Noyes' more recent work.
They are all well worth seeing, and
the artist has consented to place
them on exhibition soon. The
pictures will he open to visitors
sometime within the next three or
four weeks.
