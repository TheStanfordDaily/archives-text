It is to be assumed that sifted
gravel has been proven to be the
material best suited to paving the
inner court of the quadrangle, else
it would not have been chosen.
The vehement objections that are
being made to it may therefore be
considered as ill-advised. But fac
ulty members and students who
have been able to resign themselves
to the thought of wading ankle
deep in cobble-stones are still fain
to enquire whether the clatter and
disturbance at present attending
the operations of the workmen is
inevitable, or whether it could be
avoided by the use of a moderate
amount of forethought. So loud
and irritating is the noise of the
screens that conducting a class in
the vicinity is fast approaching the
impossible. At the present rate of
progress there can be little relief
within two months. To the lay
mind it would appear that the
screening process could be carried
on at a distance from the quadran
gle with results equally satisfactory
to the authorities and infinitely
more agreeable to classroom hab
itues.
