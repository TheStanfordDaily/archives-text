If the editors of the Junior an
nual are open to suggestions calcu
lated to assist them in producing a
Quad of unusual excellence, we can
do no better than to call their at
tention to the system of gathering
material in favor at the University
of Wisconsin. The method fol
lowed there for some years, of offer
ing prizes covering every depart
ment represented in the book, is to
be made unusually comprehensive
this year. Instead of putting forth
incentives for a story and a poem
alone, the "Badger" board arranges
a long list of prizes, not very costly
in total, but snflicient to draw out
whatever talent the university

may possess. For example, the list
is headed with a prize of $6 for the
best story of college life at Wis
consin, with second and third
prizes in proportion. Next come
prizes for collections of college
verse, storyettes, rhymes, jingles,
nonsense verse,clever things of any
character, and then for a collection
of joshes and personal stories tak
ing off well-known professors or
students. College verse is Bought
after; and to add variety, hoy and
girl effort is encouraged with a re
ward for the most worthy verses
submitted by a high school pupil.
These offers cover the literary fea
tures. Art is equally well looked
after. The best full-page original
illustration will be worth $5, and
the best original illustrated joke
$3. The best four original depart
mental headings are likewise on the
list, as well as sets of college photo
graphs, and art work by high school
students.
By means of this method the
"Badger" board secures a wealth
and variety of material that per
haps could be obtained in no other
way. It is possible that the
Quad editors would not find this
feasible, but it is certainly worth
their consideration.
