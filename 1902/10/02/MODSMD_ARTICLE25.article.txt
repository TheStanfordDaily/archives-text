# Charges of Professionalism.
## 
### 
Before the universities of the
West have opened there conies a
charge of professionalism. Chicago
and Michigan are the chief offend
ers. Both these universities are
accused of offering "inducements"
to a couple of promising "prep."
school players. It is reported that
during the two weeks of preliminary
practice preceding the open
ing of Ann Arbor, these two
lads were given a "good time"
with free transportation by the
athletic managers of the Wolverine
institution. One thing that gives
the charge credence is the fact that
the beneficiaries of this "rushing"
waver in making a choice of either
of the colleges.
The faculty conference between
these two universities agreed that
all preliminary training should be
done on the college fields. This
provision seems to have been vio
lated by Michigan. Hence the ac
cusation from Chicago of "profes
nasiolism."
