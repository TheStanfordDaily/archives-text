Editor Daily Palo Alto:
At a meeting of the Sophomore
class today it was carried that
white caps with the numerals em
broidered in, be authorized as a
claBS cap. This enables the most
unathletic man in 1905 to be placed
on a par with the hardest-working
athlete, so far as the question of
numerals goes. Whether this be
right or not, is a question that
would be easily settled if some one
not entitled to the right wore an
"S" on the quad. Sophomore.
