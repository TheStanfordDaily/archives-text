Among the features of the new
semester's activity there is nothing
more remarkable than the phenom
enal increase in the number of vol
umes daily handed over the desk
of the Library. In some measure
the unprecedented demand for
books is due to the presence of an
unusually large freshman class,
and to the addition of new reading
courses. But there must also be
considered the facility in the dis
tribution of books, which has been
brought about by the present
Library authorities. The introduc
tion of modern methods of classifi
cation, and a constant effort to pro
mote the interests of the reading
student, have been appreciated by
the University community.
