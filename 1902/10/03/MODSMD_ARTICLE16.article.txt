In coming to the aid of the tennis
men with a proposition to assist
them with an entertainment, the
Sophomores have shown a spirit
worthy of emulation. But without
in any way wishing to throw cold
water on the plan, we must say
that the method suggested for rais
ing funds does not seem altogether
a happy one. The Sophomore cir
cus at Berkeley was successful
more from a financial point of view
than otherwise. Aside from the fact
that it is not original, there is the
certainty that something better can
he gptten up, a vaudeville show in
Assembly Hall, for instance, which
would be well attended and much
more liable to be acceptable to
patrons. Stanford has a large
number of able "stuntists," who
would be glad to contribute their
services for such an object.
In authorizing the indiscriminate
use of class numerals on
their caps the Sophomores were
guilty of an indiscretion hardly to
be expected from the most unsophis

ticated freshman. Last semester,
1905, along with every other class
in the University, presented its ath
letes with jerseys and the right to
emblazon their caps with class
numerals. The Sophomores under
mine not only the prestige of their
own athletes hut also that deserved
hy every athlete in the University.
