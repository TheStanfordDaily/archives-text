# Michigan Man Will Coach.
## 
### 
Stuart M. Kohn, who played two
years at the University of Michigan
under the coaching of the famous
"Biffy" Lee, will come down from
San Francisco for a few days next
week, and at intervals thereafter, to
take a hand in coaching the eleven.
Kohn was quarter-back on the '99
team at Ann Arbor, and was rated
ae one of the headiest little men in
the business. It was due to his
coaching that St. Matthew's was
able to play so brilliantly against
the Freshmen two weeks ago. Since
Kohn entered the practice of law in
San Francisco he has taken much
interest in Stanford athletics. His
offer to coach is purely voluntary,
although most welcome.
