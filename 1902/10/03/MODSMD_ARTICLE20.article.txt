# "Chappie" Out Again.
## 
### 
The second number of the Chap
arral is out. It is a great improve
ment over the first number, if not
over any number of former years.
The art work is exceptionally good.
The page drawing by Culver is per
haps the best that has ever ap
peared in the Chaparral. The ed
itorials are peculiarly to the point,
the second one especially express
ing the sentiments of every loyal
Stanford man. The verse is rather
scarce but it is of high order, and
the jokes are away above the aver
age both as to quality and number.
The paper gives evidence of finan
cial prosperity in the increased
number of ads.
