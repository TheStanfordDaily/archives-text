# Football Outlook Brighter.
## 
### 
The football outlook has changed
for the better during the past week.
Last Friday the prospects of inflict
ing a defeat upon Reliance were not
very encouraging, yet the team was
victorious in one of the grittiest
games of football ever played on
the campus. It has been recognized
from the first of the season that
there is enough good material to
make a strong backfield. This the
match proved to be a well-grounded
fact. With the exception of an un
fortunate proclivity for fumbling,
the Stanford backs played a hard,
fast game. They ran interference
well, bucked hard and consistently,
and backed the line men on defense.
The game that the line played,
however, came as a most pleasura
ble surprise to the Cardinal root
ers. Heavily outweighed by the
heavy clubmen, their superiority in
team-work was plainly evident.
The week's practice has increased
in no small degree the optimism
that has for its base Saturday's
game. Although no man is sure of

a place on the eleven, every man
on the field is fighting with spirit
and determination. Bartell has
been playing at end during the
week, where with Clark and Wil
bur he has been showing well.
This leaves McGilvray, "Savage"
Dole, and Smith as the three men
most likely to carry the ball, with
Bansbach at the quarter-back.
While Lee is a practical surety at
center, the guards' positions are
points of contest. Hauverman,
Jacobs, and Monzingo, who will be
back in the game next week, seem
to be about evenly matched for
places by the side of the captain.
McFadden on the right side of the
line will probably play one tackle,
while there is still left tackle
to be filled. Stillman and "Guiby"
Dole seem to be the principal con
testants, but neither is showing up
so strongly that he can be regarded
as assured of the place.
Tomorrow's game with the strong
Alumni team, which Berkeley de
feated last Saturday, will enable
some accurate comparison to be
drawn concerning the merits of
California and Stanford.
The Freshmen present as discour
aging a picture as do the Varsity
men a hopeful one. The men show
a lamentable ignorance of team
work, their fumbling is frequent
and bad, and their individual play
is by no means first-class, with
possibly two exceptions.
