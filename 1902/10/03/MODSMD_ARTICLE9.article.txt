# SOPHOMORE CIRCUS.
## Class of 1905 Votes to Aid Tennis Court Fund with Vaudeville Entertainment. 
### 
At the Sophomore meeting this
afternoon Harry Edwards, treasurer
of the student body, addressed the
class upon the advisability of giv
ing a circus vaudeville performance
for the benefit of a fund to build
new tennis courts. A motion to
carry out this idea was passed, and
the president was given power to
appoint a committee to get the plan
into shape and report at the next
meeting. Treasurer Edwards is to
serve on this committee.
A measure was passed for the
adoption of a Sophomore insignia
in the shape of a white skull
cap. A committee will procure
the same and a date will be
set later when all Sophomores are
supposed to appear on the quad
under such shelter as the "skull"
affords.
After the meeting committees
were appointed as follows: On caps,
G. R. Stevens, J. P. Davidson, I. H.
Sevier, chairman; on circus, E. Y.
Pomeroy, 0. Kehrlein, E. Beach,
M. H. Thorpe, R. C. Nissen, H. J.
Edwards, chairman.
