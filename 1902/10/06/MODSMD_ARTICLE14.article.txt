Beginning with the passage of
the constitutional amendment con
firming the University trusts, a
series of important steps have been
taken toward what may properly
he called the re-founding of the
University upon a legal and work
able basis. On Friday last one of
these steps, second in importance
only to the great gift of last De
cember, was taken by Mrs. Stanford
when she delivered the remarkable
address printed in full in this
issue. It is a part of the constitu
tion of the University; but, above
all else, it will be revered as consti
tuting the expression, and the tan
gible medium for the transmission
to future generations, of the spirit
°112 M ,e foundation as it has been
understood and felt by founders,
faculty, and students since the
opening days of the University.
With the exception of a few clauses,
Mrs. Stanford's meaning is made
perfectly clear to those unfamiliar
with local conditions, or with the
former grants and addresses, in
connection with which it must be
read.
Many of the clauses constitute a
relaxation or withdrawal of her
former directions and a return to
the more general terms of the
original founding grant, Mrs.
Stanford having learned by ex
perience that regulations respecting
University control and business
management must be susceptible to
change with changing conditions.
In the matter of the appointment
of professors and the determination
of their salaries, Mrs. Stanford
withdraws the somewhat conflicting
directions in the former addressee,
at least one of which indicates on
its face that it was drawn under a
misinterpretation of the original

grant, and returns to Article IV of
the Founding Grunt, where these
mutters are left to the Trustees.
She increases the functions of the
President over those specified in
the original grant —and she is said
to have explained the provision
more fully to the Trustees —by
providing that the hoard must
adopt a plan for the nomination of
professors, presumably through the
President, and requiring that they
shall consult him upon all matters
of University administration.
The clause requiring the Univer
sity to keep in touch with the
high schools anticipates a possible
breach in the future, either by
raising the University require
ments, or by a rearrangement of
high school courses in the interest
of the great majority of students
who do not go to universities.
Under the present school law the
latter can only be done with the
assent of the University of Cali
fornia, as all high schools must
give courses which will fit the
graduate for entrance to the State
University. In either event the
University can bridge over the
breach by allowing certain high
school students special concessions
in entrance upon special or partial
standing, or by offering supplemen
tary courses for their benefit. The
principle underlying the provision
is fundamental. The object is to
prevent the introduction of a sift
ing process between the free public
school system and University which
would eliminate students of limited
means, on whose account the Uni
versity was so heavily endowed
that it might offer instruction free,
or nearly so. That this is no idle
fear is attested by the experience of
Harvard, where for over twenty
years the highest percentage of
matriculates from high schools has
been 33, and where it has fallen as
low as 23 per cent, the balance be
ing prepared in about equal pro
portions by private tutors and pri
vate preparatory schools not ac
cessible to students of limited
means. The object of this and
several other clauses in the address
is to make the institution equally
accessible and agreeable to rich and
poor alike.
