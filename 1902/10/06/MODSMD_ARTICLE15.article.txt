# FUTURE POLICY OUTLINED.
## Address of Jane Lathrop Stanford to the Board of Trustees of the University, October 3, 1902. 
### 
To the Hoard of Trustees of The
Leland Stanford, Junior Univer
sity:
Gentlemen: —
The time has arrived when I
should take steps to putin the form
of an address to you certain addi
tions to and changes in my direc
tions heretofore made, which I deem
necessary respecting the manage
ment of the University and its prop
erties. These changes, while I live
and have charge, can be attended
to and not be questioned; but when
the management of the institution
devolves upon you, I do not wish
any doubts to arise as to my inten
tions, and hence take this occasion
to make my views clear.
The Trustees being organized as
a Board, with the assent of the sur
viving Founder, and under and in
accordance with the State Constitu
tion and special act of theLegislature
all directions heretofore made by
me as to the appointment, powers,
and duties of its officers and of an
executive and finance committee
are withdrawn, and in lieu thereof
the Board is directed to adopt by
laws providing for its officers and
necessary committees, and specify
ing their powers and duties.
The directions heretofore made
requiring the Board of Trustees to
maintain the stables upon the Palo
Alto Farm and to maintain the
vineyard at Vina, are withdrawn.
As long as the vineyard at Vina
produces a reasonable income, I
recommend its maintenance.
1 have erected the Church, As
sembly, and Chemical Laboratory
referred to in my former directions.
I therefore withdraw all directions
concerning their location or erec
tion.
No rule or direction heretofore
made shall prevent the application
of the endowment funds of the Uni
versity toward the improvement of
any real estate now or hereafter
held in trust for the University.
All property, real and personal,
held in trust for the maintenance
of the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, except the Palo Alto Farm
and my San Francisco residence,
may be sold and conveyed, and the
proceeds thereof invested for the
benefit of the University.
The concurrence of a majority
(eight) of the Board of Trustees
shall be necessary and sufficient for
the sale of property, for the invest
ment of funds, or for the trans
action of any other business, irre
spective of whether or not they, or
any of them, shall be officers of
said Board or members of any com
mittee thereof.
The Board of Trustees of the Le
land Stanford Junior University,
as such, or in the name of the
institution, or by other intelligible
designation of the Trustees, or of
(he institution, may receive proper
ty, real or personal, and wherever
situated, by gift, grant, devise, or
bequest, for the benefit of the insti
tution, or of any department there
of, and such property, unless other
wise provided, shall be held by the
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University upon the trusts
provided for in the grant founding
the University, and amendments
thereof, and grants, bequests, and

devises supplementary thereto,
within the meaning of Article IX,
Section 10, of the Constitution of
the State of California.
Any directions heretofore made
by me inconsistent with any of the
provisions of Subdivisions 9, 10
and 11 of Article IV of the Found
ing Grant are withdrawn. The
Hoard of Trustees should adopt
such a plan for the nomination and
appointment of professors and
teachers, and the determination of
their salaries, as experience of this
and similar institutions may prove
to be desirable. During my admin
istration the President of the Uni
versity shall continue to have the
exclusive control over the appoint
ment and dismissal of professors
and teachers, as he has had here
tofore.
The Board of Trustees should al
ways avail itself of the knowledge
and experience of the President of
the University, who, by reason of
the high and disinterested position
which he holds, will be found to be
a safe counsellor in all matters of
University administration, and in
all differences and conflicting
claims within and between depart
ments.
No direction heretofore made by
me shall prevent the continuance
of regular or special University
instruction in any and all of the
University departments throughout
the summer months, provided the
same is authorized by the Board of
Trustees, and under the exclusive
control of the University authori
ties.
In so far as necessary, or the
nature of the case requires, instruc
tion and investigation, together
with suitable facilities therefor,
may be maintained elsewhere than
upon the Palo Alto Farm.
No direction or request hereto
fore made by me shall prohibit the
maintenance of such elementary
and other schools upon the Palo
Alto Farm as may be found neces
sary to experimental instruction in
the department of Education of the
University.
The Board of Trustees shall de
termine whether or not any charge
for tuition, or registration fee, shall
be levied in any department of the
University, and the amount of such
charge or fee; and it may exempt
residents of California from the
payment of any such charge or fee.
The Board of Trustees shall de
termine the conditions of admission
to the Museum, including the
charge therefor, if any; but 1 be
lieve it to be desirable that an ad
mission fee should always be
charged to the public. By experi
ence I have learned it to be a par
tial protection to the valuable
articles within its walls.
My Palo Alto residence may be
used as a residence for the Presi
dent of the University, or for such
other purposes as the Board of
Trustees may determine, after my
wishes are carried out as to remov
ing certain articles from therein, to
be placed in the Museum, which
are mentioned in my last will and
testament, or in an address hereto
fore made by me to the Trustees.
The articles not mentioned are to
remain in the home.

Boarding- and lodging- houses
may be erected and maintained by
private parties and corporations
upon the Palo Alto Farm only
under express authorization of the
lioard of Trustees, and under its
supervision and control. The same
and all other buildings upon the
Palo Alto Farm shall be subject to
the rules of discipline of the Uni
versity, and subject to the orders
and control of the Board of Trus
tees.
No additional interments shall
be made or permitted in the ceme
tery adjacent to the Mausoleum,
and the requirement that a ceme
tery be maintained upon the Palo
Alto Farm is hereby withdrawn.
It shall be the duty of the Board
of Trustees to make general laws
providing for the government of
the University, and to provide for
just and equitable rules of dis
cipline.
Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity to promote the public wel
fare by founding, endowing and
having maintained a University
with the colleges, schools, seminaries
of learning, mechanical institutes,
museums, galleries of art, and all
other things necessary and appro
priate to a University of high de
gree, all other directions or reserva
tions in the Founding Grant and
all amendments or attempted
amendments thereof by the
Founders, or by the survivor of
them, shall be deemed incidental
and subordinate to that paramount
purpose; and the invalidity of any
direction, or attempted amendment,
or of anything herein contained,
shall not affect the validity of any
conveyances heretofore or hereafter
made to the University, or to the
Trustees thereof, or of the directions
herein or heretofore made, as far as
such directions are otherwise valid;
and if any such directions or at
tempted amendments are found
not to be legal or binding, they
may, notwithstanding, be regarded
as advisory or permissive so far as
they shall be capable of execution.
In my former directions I have
placed a minimum upon the cost of
buildings to be erected upon the
Palo Alto Farm. Should times
and conditions so change in the
future that the Board of Trustees,
in their best judgment, should
find that such minimum cost no
longer bears the same proportion
to the then condition of affairs that
it does now, then they are allowed
from time to time to change the
amount named by me as such
minimum cost; but in that case no
building shall be built by a lessee
except under plans first approved
by such Board of Trustees.
Contracts have been made for a
new and large gymnasium, with a
view to improving the physical
condition of the students attending
the University, and the college
authorities should urge them to
fully avail themselves of its advan
tages and to lead a hygienic life.
In my judgment it is the duty of
the University authorities to send
out into the world students with
good physical health as well as
with good mental attainments, in
order that they may successfully
fight the battle of life.
Pursuant to the policy of the
Founders as outlined in the Found
ing Grant of encouraging advanced
instruction and original research,
it has been determined that a more
commodious library should be built,

capable of affording suitable facili
ties and accommodations for the
increasing number of postgraduate
students, as well as those receiving
undergraduate instruction. The
inadequacy of the other collections
of books in this vicinity rentiers an
unusually large University library
necessary, and the present library
building can be well used for a
law library and other necessary
purposes. The site of such library
has been selected, and the plans
of the interior have been approved,
and its erection will probably be
commenced within the coming
year.
The University must be forever
maintained upon a strictly non
partisan and non-sectarian basis.
It must never become an instru
ment in the hands of any political
party or any religious sect or or
ganization. I believe that the
moral and religious development
of the University will be better
accomplished if entirely free from
all denominational alliances, how
ever slight the bond may be. The
services in the Memorial Church
must be simple and informal in
character, and the theological ques
tions, services and observances,
upon which the sects differ, should
not be entered upon, so that mem
bers of ever}' church may worship
and receive instruction therein not
inconsistent with their individual
beliefs. Provision has been made
whereby all those who love our
Lord Jesus Christ may partake of
the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup
per at stated intervals in the Me
morial Church. Attendance at re
ligious services shall be entirely
optional, and no profession of re
ligious faith or belief shall be ex
acted of anyone for any purpose.
I desire that the University shall
be forever kept out of politics, and
that no professor shall electioneer
among or seek to dominate other
professors or the students for the
success of any political party or
candidate in any political contest.
I hope that every voter, whether
professor or student, will always
thoroughly inform himself upon
every principle involved, and as to
the merits of every candidate seek
ing his suffrage, and then vote ac
cording to his own best judgment and
conscience, irrespective of any im
portunity of others. And in order
to freely do this he should not be
subjected to any importunity, since
it is possible that cases might arise
where a mere suggestion might be
understood to be a covert demand.
It has been the history of uni
versities that their professors rarely
take the public rostrum in political
campaigns. The very infrequency
of their having done so would seem
to prove that there is some sound
reason why they should not. The
reason, I think, is not far to find.
When a professor speaks to a pub
lic audience, the audience is gath
ered together, to some extent nt
least, because he is a professor of a
university. Whether they should
do so or not, his hearers consider
that he appears as a representative
of the university of which he is a
professor, and therefore voices its
views and sentiments. It is im
possible for some members of his
audience, and probably impossible
for most of them, to entirely dis
associate the man from his position.
If they go to hear him because he
is a professor, they must almost
necessarily assume that the views
and sentiments which he expresses
have a general foothold in his uni
ersity; whereas such assumption
may he very far from the actual
fact of the case, and the public may
thereby he greatly deceived. So far
as he may represent himself only,
so far as it is the man and not the
professor that speaks to public
audiences, he should have the full
est possible liberty of speech, for
he but represents himself and is
accountable only to himself; but
when the circumstances are such
that he must know that he is being
deemed by his hearers, or any of
them, to be speaking for his univer
sity and voicing its views, then, un
less he knows that he is indeed truly
and correctly voicing those views,
unless he knows that he is not de
ceiving his hearers in that regard,
or even if he thinks he is correctly
stating the views of his university,
yet as he has not and could not
have any authority to speak for it,
he should keep silent.
If the professors of this Univer
sity believe the above to be the true
reason why professors of other uni
versities have nearly altogether ab
stained from entering upon the
public rostrum in the discussion of
political and other questions upon
which public feeling runs high, and
upon which the public is itself
divided, then I indulge in the hope
that they will follow their example.
The University was not made
independent of State control be
cause of any purpose of the Found
ers inconsistent with its character
as a State institution, but because
they believed that its purposes
could be better and more surely
accomplished through a Board of
Trustees free from possible political
or partisan influence, and inde
pendent of all external control save
that of Courts of Equity. Notwith
standing their creation of the Uni
versity as an independent institu
tion, it was the wish and purpose
of the Founders that it should be
kept, as far as practicable, in har
mony with the public educational
system, and that, in the matter of
entrance requirements, as well as in
every other relation of the Univer
sity with the general public, the
University authorities should take
into consideration the welfare of
those who do not attend the Uni
versity as well as those who do,and
adopt the policy which, in their
judgment, is in accord with the
spirit of the foundation, as above
defined. Without necessarily lower
ing the standard of regular admis
sion to the University, concessions
may be made in admission upon
partial or special standing, or other
wise, in favor of students coming
from high schools which cannot
afford to maintain a separate course
of study for the benefit of the small
minority of high school students
who go to universities, but offer a
reasonable number of practical
studies for the preparation of their
students for an immediate entry
into the active walks of life. So
long as the public maintains an
efficient high school system, the
education given by the University
to a student should commence
where that given to him bv the
high school ends; and there should
be no gap in his necessary educa
tion between where the high school
ends and the university begins, and
which omitted part of his education
could only be supplied by private
schools —the latter not being gener
ally accessible to the students of
limited means. The University
authorities are, however, the sole
judges of the qualifications of appli

cants for admission to any depart
ment of the institution.
The University has been endowed
with a view of offering instruction
free, or nearly free, that it may re
sist the tendency to the stratifica
tion of society, by keeping open an
avenue whereby the deserving and
exceptional may rise through their
own efforts from the lowest to the
highest stations in life. A spirit
of equality must accordingly be
maintained within the University.
To this end it shall be the duty of
the University authorities to pro
hibit excessive expenditures and
other excesses on the part of stu
dents, and the formation or growth
of any organization, custom, or
social function that tends to the
development of exclusive or undem
ocratic castes within the University,
and to exclude from the institution
anyone whose conduct is inconsist
ent with the spirit of the founda
tion.
While its chief object is the in
struction of students with a view to
producing leaders and educators in
every field of science and industry,
the University was also designed
"to advance learning, the arts, and
sciences"; and to this end the insti
tution should assist, by experi
mentation and research, in the ad
vancement of useful knowledge,
and in the dissemination and prac
tical application of the same.
The Founding Grant provides that
the Trustees shall establish and
maintain at the University an edu
cational system which will, if
followed, fit the graduate for some
useful pursuit, and to this end,
cause the pupils, as early as may
be, to declare the particular calling
which they may desire to pursue.
The purpose of this requirement is
not only to assure the practical
character of the instruction, and to
prevent such instruction as will not
tend directly "to qualify students
for personal success and direct use
fulness in life," but to protect the
University from the cost of instruct
ing and from the baneful influence
of a class, bound to infest the insti
tution as the country grows older,
who wish to acquire a university
degree or fashionable educational
veneer for the mere ornamentation
of idle and purposeless lives.
The moving spirit of the Found
ers in the foundation and endow
ment of the Lei and Stanford Junior
University was love of humanity
and a desire to render the greatest
possible service to mankind. The
University was accordingly de
signed for the betterment of man
kind morally, spiritually, intellect
ually, physically, and materially.
The public at large, and not alone
the comparatively few students
who can attend the University, are
the chief and ultimate beneficiaries
of the foundation. While the in
struction offered must be such as
will qualify the students for per
sonal success and direct usefulness
in life, they should understand that
it is offered in the hope and trust
that they will become thereby of
greater service to the public.
As stated in the letter to the
Trustees accompanying the Found
ing Grant, "The object is not alone
to give the student a technical edu
cation, fitting him for a successful
business life, but it is also to instill
into his mind an appreciation of
the blessings of this Government, a
reverence for its institutions, and a
love of God and humanity, to the
end that he may go forth and by
precept and example spread the I

great truths by the light of which
his fellow men will be elevated and
taught how to obtain happiness in
this world and in the life eternal."
