—A chair of Chinese has been
established at Columbia Univer
sity.
—The registration at Nebraska
this year is 1407, the largest in the
university's history.
— Some eight hundred freshmen
and sophomores of the University of
Minnesota participated in a lively
cane rush lately.
—The nearest approach to a
daily paper at Columbia is the
Spectator, which appears semi
weekly. The need of a daily paper
has long been felt, and plans are
being laid to begin the publication
of one this fall. There are a num
ber of literary publications, some of
them monthly, some semi-monthly,
and some weekly.—Nebraslcan.
—A football game was scheduled
on October 4th between Dickinson
College and the Carlisle Indian
School, but was not played because
the coaches could not agree about
the length of the halves. Coach
Warner of the Indians wanted to
play 25-minute halves, the same as
last year, but Dicknison wanted to
play only '20-minute halves. The
Dickinson team left the field and
relations between the two will
probably he severed.
—The trainer of the Columbia
varsity track team has announced
that he expects to take to England
next Bummer a team of American
track athletes to compel with the
athletes of Great Britain. The
team will be: Mike Sweeney,
holder of the world's record at high
jumping; Arthur Duffy, world's
record 100-yard dash; Harry Gill,
all-round Amateur Athletic Union
champion, 1900; Frank M. Karaly,
holder of the five-mile Amateur
Athletic Union championship in
1901; George Peary, the weight
thrower; and Tom Keene and Ed
Hobbs, the Boston sprinters.
—A friend of Columbia Univer
sity,in New York City,has offered to
endow a university press, with a
private printing plant, to cost $20,-
000, for the benefit of the student
publications. The offer is now in
the hands of the trustees, where its
acceptance seems doubtful, inas
much as several of the trustees are
said to be unfavorable to the acqui
sition of a press by the university.
Whether or not the plan is ac
cepted by the trustees the student
publications are practically as
sured of having a private plant
near the University. Several of
the leading printing firms in New
York have already been approached
with a view of establishing a branch
near the institution for the print
ing of college papers. —Michigan
