# Reliance Defeated by California.
## 
### 
The California-Reliance game at
Berkeley Saturday resulted in a
16 to 0 score in favor of the college
team. The Reliance line-up was
much the same as the week before,
when they met Stanford; but the
Varsity was weakened by the loss
of Smith, who was called home by
the death of his father, and More,
who had a bad shoulder. Through
out the game the ball was in Re
liance territory, but California
twice failed to score when within a
a few feet of the goal, and was twice
held on downs. Mini, Sherman
and Albertson were the stars of the
game.
