# Stanford 18, Alumni 0.

### 
Saturday's game with the Al
umni resulted in an easy victory
for the Varsity. The score, 18 to
0, would have been larger had it
not been for the repeated fumbling
of the home team at critical points
of the game. Three times the ball
was lost by careless play when with
in ten yards of a score. On the
whole the game was not as thor
oughly appreciated by the bleach
ers as was the game with the Re
liance clubmen. That the Varsity
should win was a foregone conclus
ion. Yet the fact that on a field
new to the visitors, against an ag
gregation which had no team-work
whatever and scarcely any intellig
ible signal work, they were able to
cross the goal line but three times,
points to no great improvement
over the first big game. There was
not the same dash, though, in fact,
there was not as much need of it.
The Varsity played straight foot
ball, using line bucks and runs
around tackle.
Not more than twice were other
players than those behind the line
allowed to carry the ball. Magee,
McGilvray, and Dole during the
first half went through the gradu
ates for a dozen yards and more at
a time. Smith and Hamilton
went in for the second half, taking
the place of Magee and Dole, and
likewise made big gains, although
during the last five minutes of the
game their attacks were not as well
supported by the line as they
should have been.
The work of the Alumni was
throughout weak and ineffectual.
Muller's punts in the first half
rarely netted him more than ten
ynrds. The backs were prevented
from making gains by the total ab
sence of interference.
The elevens were made up as fol
lows:
