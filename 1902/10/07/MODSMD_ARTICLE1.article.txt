# SENIORS AND JUNIORS TIE.
## Another Game Will Be Needed to Settle Upper-Class Differences. 
### 
The Junior team put up a plucky
fight against their opponents from
the Senior class in a fiercely con
tested game of football that result
ed in a score of 0-0 this afternoon.
Naught-three kicked off to Hamil
i 1 ton, who ran through the whole
Senior team for twenty-five yards.
Naught-four made its distance once
on line bucks and then '03 held for
downs. The ball was carried back
and forth, neither side - being able
to make its distance for three con
secutive times. Parker was forced
to kick and recovered the ball on
the thirty-five-yard line. The half
was called with the ball on '04's
thirty-yard line. The Juniors
kicked to Smith, who ran the ball
in ten yards, and then circled the
left end for twenty-five yards more,
Hamilton tackling. Naught-three
bucked the ball to the twenty-five
yard line and were held for downs.
Hamilton carried it almost unaided
for five and ten yards and then
was forced to kick. In the ex
change of punts Parker gained
heavily. Naught-three was un
successful in a place-kick for goal
just before time was called, with
the ball on the Juniors' twenty
yard line.
The game was loosely played,
the Junior line failing to hold ex
cept at critical times. Parker for
the Seniors carried the ball most
consistently, and "Hank" Hamil
ton for the Juniors played a strong,
heady game. The ball was in
Junior territory most of the time
but the '04 goal was in danger
once only.
The two classes will play off the
tie Friday afternoon.
