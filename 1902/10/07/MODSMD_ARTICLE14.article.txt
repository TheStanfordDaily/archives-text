It would seem that "Sophomore"
in his communication, apropos the
cap agitation, has missed entirely
the object of the criticism which
has been directed against the action
of his classmates, and which the
Daily Palo Alto voiced on Fri
day. As to misinformation, the
paper takes the opportunity of
quoting from the minutes of the
meeting, which say: "Moved and
seconded that white skull caps be
adopted." Plainly it is the skull
cap with class numeral that was
adopted, "Sophomore" to the con
trary notwithstanding. The class
may have, through their committee
or otherwise, departed from their
original intention; if so we have
had no other intimation than that
contained in the communication.
Our position in the affair remains
unchanged. Skull caps with
numerals are among college
men everywhere the insigna
of an athlete. Class numerals on
a plug would to no one indicate an
athlete. The members of 1905
voted to allow class numerals to be
put on their skull-caps, an offence
which of its kind is second only to
an indiscriminate use of the Var
sity "S." The agitation is by no
means paltry when college tradi
tion is concerned.
