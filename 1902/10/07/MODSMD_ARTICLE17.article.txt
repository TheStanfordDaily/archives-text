# RABBI VOORSANGER'S SERMON.
## Noted Jewish Teacher Delivered an Eloquent Address at Sunday Morning- Chapel Services. 
### 
Rabbi Voorsanger of San Fran
cisco preached an eloquent and
forceful sermon to a large audience
in the chapel Sunday morning,
taking as his text Psalms 119:133:
"Order my steps in thy word; and
let not any iniquity have dominion
over me." He said in part:
"This is the first week of the
Jewish religious New Year. The
Jew does not believe the world is
just 5663 years old; that is a con
vention based on the tradition from
Genesis. I believe that the Eter
nal Mind has been eternally active
and the idea that it remained
dormant till 6000 years ago is an
insult to the human understand
ing.
"There is no chance or accident.
You may be sure the force of mil
lions of years ago as it came from the
Divine Will makes the world what
it is and what it is destined to be.
The Jew looks on the New Year
soberly; he does not celebrate with
bonfires and tooting of horns; he
believes it marks a slice cut for
him from time. Every thing hap
pens in time. As Carlyle says,
'Time is the silent mirror of all
ages.'
"Man is but a fraction, a mere
atom in the universe, but still there
is a chance for him. My theory is
in part parallel with fatalism. Re
ligious truth is made complete by
human emotion: scientific truth is
made complete by facts. Moses
said man cannot live by bread
alone, 1 say man cannot be saved
by science; there must be some
moral purpose in social schemes,
or I would say in face of God, man
has no right to exist. Flammar
ion pictures the last despairing
man on a bare rock, clutching the
last ray of light and falling over
dead. If this is the end, I cannot
see why a silly God created man;
we must assume a divine purpose.
The danger of predestination is
that it removes the human will;
society would go to the devil
quicker than even Flammarion
pictures it. It is the human will
that makes the world glorious.
Man is not able to change the uni
verse, but there are circles within
circles, and man in his own sphere
can weild the moral axe and make
himself happier, he can create des
tiny and influence the race within
his own circle. You can will being
men and not slaves.
"Flammarion may be right in
his theory, but the eternal years
of God are ours and many ages
must elapse before man has worked
out his destiny. • In the meantime,
exercise your will to achieve har
mony and happiness for yourself
and those around you."
