# Freshmen Scored on Varsity.
## 
### 
The football practice last night
was long and hard. The first
half hour was devoted to light sig
nal work, starting from the mark,
and punting by Ma gee and Lee.
The Varsity and first Freshman
teams then lined up for the hardest
practice of the season. The work
that the youngsters were able to do
was little credit to the Varsity.
Although the Varsity players held
their opponents for downs, the
Freshmen were allowed to keep the
ball and succeeded in bucking from
their thirty-yard line to a touch
down. Tarpey was tried at tackle
in McFadden'a place, and with Lee
at center and Hauverman and Ja
cobs at guards, the line proved
fairly strong. Most gains were
made over the Varsity tackles, but
the Freshmen had to fight for every
inch they gained. Clemens, Mur

phy, and Slaker were behind the
Freshmen all the time, directing
and encouraging. The Varsity
ends were not circled during the
scrimmage, and even succeeded in
throwing back the runners for the
loss of a few yards on several occa
sions.
For the last few minutes of play
the Varsity took the offensive. The
Freshmen held hard but were un
able to withstand the fierce bucks
of the heavier men.
After the scrimmage the Varsity
ran through some fast signal work
for ten minutes. With no one else
on the gridiron, the coaches devot
ed their entire attention to the for
mations. Head Coach Clemens
busied himself with the line men,
while Slaker endeavored to improve
the team-work of the backfield.
Flanders, who has )been showing
up well for end on the Freshman
team, sustained a severe injury to
his right ankle during the scrim
mage last night. It is probable
that he will be kept out of the game
for the rest of the season.
