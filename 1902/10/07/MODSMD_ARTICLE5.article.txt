# SPANISH FARCE.
## Club Tertulia Planning a New Departure in Undergraduate Dramatics. 
### 
The Club Tertulia has in prepar
ation an original Spanish farce
entitled, "Calderon Contra Ram
sey," to be presented in the near
future at Roble Hall. In compos
ing and presenting an original farce
in a foreign language, the club has
untertaken what has not yet been
accomplished by the students of
any college in the United States.
Judging from the first rehearsal
which was held today in Assembly
Hall, success is assured. Admis
sion will be entirely by invitation,
owing to the limited seating capac
ity of the hall.
