# Sophomore Cap Again.

Editor Daily Palo Alto: •
In the editorial column of your
Friday's issue you stated that the
Sophomore class, in adopting as a
class insignia, white caps bearing
the class numerals, is guilty of a
grave indiscretion. The writer is
inclined to believe that you have
been misinformed, both as to the
action and intent of the '05 class.
In the first place the cap adopted
is far from being the style com
monly worn by Stanford athletes,
in that it more in the form of the
golf cap without the extended visor
peculiar to the "skull" worn by
athletes. No objection has been
raised to the numerals worn on
Junior plugs or Sophomore som
breros. Then why should so much
adverse comment be forthcoming
against Sophomores wearing their
class numerals upon caps which
bear little or no resemblance to
those worn by athletes? It seems
that your only ground for censure
would be in regard to caps and not
numerals. The Sophomore class
is wholly aware of the distinctive
rights of athletes and it would be
the last to infringe upon those
rights. Sopiiomork.
