# MEMORIAL SERVICE.
## Faculty and Students Pay Tribute to George M. Richardson and Herbert C. Nash. 
### 
The memorial service held last
evening in the chapel in honor of
Professor George Mann Richardson
and Librarian Herbert C. Nash
was attended by many of their
friends among the student body
and among the faculty.
President Jordan presided and
spoke briefly of the relations of the
two men to the University and of
the services they had rendered. He
was followed by Prof. Stillman,
Prof. Angela, Prof. Abbott, Dr. El
liott and Associate Librarian
Dodge.
Dr. Stillman spoke of Professor
Richardson especiallyfrom his many
years of fellowship with him,saying:
"It is a sad service that brings our
University community together
this evening to give formal expres
sion of our sense of losb in the gen
tle and noble lives that have gone
from us. In the few minutes at my
disposal I may speak especially of
my immediate associate and friend,
George Mann Richardson. Let me
bear public testimony to the admi
ration and affection inspired in me
as in all who knew him, by the
wisdom, the courage, the honesty,
and the kind and loyal heart of our
departed colleague.
"During the ten years of his ac
tive work at Stanford he has been
one of the most influential mem
bers of those committees which
have had most responsible and dif
ficult duties, and was thus known
widely beyond his department
work. His own experience and
participation in athletic affairs
made him a wise counsellor in the
athletic relations of the University.
The arduous labors connected with
the necessary work of department
administration left him little time
for the work of laboratory research,
particularly as the many years of
hampered finances exacted much
labor from him which would usu
ally be entrusted to subordinate
officials. His original research
work was consequently limited in
volume though excellent in quality.
Papers embodying the results
of investigations by Professor Rich
ardson have appeared in the prin
cipal chemical journals of this
country.
"Circumstances of outer condition
limited Dr. Richardson's labors as
an investigator in these pioneer
years of our University, but his
efficiency as a teacher had full
opportunity. Few men have the
faculty of holding both the respect
and devotion of students such as
he possessed. Simple in his
method and straightforward, he
found his way to the open heart of
youth. His simple, kindly nature
attracted his students, and his
scholarship retained their interest.
"Wise in counsel, calm and clear
in judgment, patient and consider
ate of other opinions, but with abso
lute honesty and fearless independ
ence; with high ideals of life and
University development, his influ
ence in the foundation period of the
University has been of the great
est value. The influence of Pro
fessor Richardson permeates the

traditions of the University, a be
nificent presence."
Dr. Angell spoke of the wide
influence exercised hy Dr. Richard
son. He said, "I believe Dr. Rich
ardson almost more than any other
man in the faculty may be said to
have had the Stanford spirit."
Dr. Elliott spoke briefly of both
men. He recalled the fact that Dr.
Richardson belonged to the original
group of fifteen teachers, and was
the first of the group to reach Palo
Alto. He gave to the new Univer
sity enthusiasm, devotion, un
swerving loyalty. His work, his
character, his influence had from
the first the invaluable quality of
steadfastness. No shock of the un
expected, no reverse, 110 tedious
night of waiting shook his purpose
or resolution or faith. There was
borne in upon all who worked with
him his transparent simplicity, his
modesty, his tact, his unobtrusive
mastery. It was early recognized
that Dr. Richardson was one of the
strong men of Stanford, one in
whom the spirit of the University
was admirably exemplified. We
are poorer by the loss of a friend
and comrade, an inspiring presence.
We are richer by that friendship
and comradeship and by an in
fluence which somehow, we believe,
will abide in the Stanford charac
ter, so long as one stone of these
quadrangles shall remain upon
another.
Mr. Nash's early association with
the University was recalled as
tutor of Leland Stanford, Jr., as
confidential secretary to Sena
tor Stanford, as not inactive
when the first inceptions of
the University were taking
shape. He was also interpreter be
tween the founders and the Uni
versity they had set .in motion,
when there was need of interpreta
tion, and the service he was thus
able to render was not small. The
invitation to become a part of the
University, the opportunity to con
tribute something directly to its
life and advancement, never came
to anyone with more joy than to
him. Unduly conscious of his own
lack of specific training, self
distrustful and sensitive to the last
degree, he yet accepted the respon
sibilities of his position with a
noble seriousness, and without the
remotest thought of other claim to
consideration than his ability to
make himself useful.
"To all, Mr. Nash was affable,
courteous, and kindly. His ex
treme modesty and shyness, with
a certain formality of manner, for
bade that immediate and hearty
fellowship which some natures
command. To this, and to his
precario henlth, is due the fact
that he entered less into the com
mon life of our community than
have many others. And yet, so
long as his strength permitted, he
was astonishingly active in ways
that contributed not a little to the
pleasure and profit of us all. Those
who came into more intimate rela
tions with him found no diminish
ing of the sensitiveness, the high -
mindedness, the perfect gentleman
liness of his character. They
found also a broad culture, a keen
mind, a rich and responsive nature.
So wa were proud of his friendship;
so we honor his memory, and
reverently inscribe his name on the
University's sadly lengthening
Roll of Honor."
Mr, Dodge, said in part: "It was
my good fortune to have been as
sociated with Mr. Nash in the Uni
versity Library for the last few
months before lie went South.
From the time 1 received my first
letter from him 1 knew that here
was true courtesy and a true gen
tleman. There is another quality
so exemplified in the life of our
friend that I wish to mention it.
Mr. Nash was a true hero. The ac
cident which befell him some years
ago was the result of an heroic at
tempt to save the lives of others.
And during all the intervening
years, those who knew him best
and saw his bodily vigor gradually
fail, always knew that the heroic
will was in the ascendency."
Dr. Abbott spoke of the self-effac
ing spirit of Mr. Nash. "In the
organization of the University, and
in the most difficult problems which
came up in the course of its admin
istration," he said, "Dr. Nash's loy
alty, devotion, and sound advice
was the greatest help to the found
ers. His services were of the high
est value, and will always be re
membered with admiration and
gratitude."
Mrs. Mary Roberts Smith sang a
solo, and the exercises closed with
the anthem, "Bow Down Thine Ear,
0 Lord," rendered by a quartet.

Dr. Elliott spoke briefly of both
men. He recalled the fact that Dr.
Richardson belonged to the original
group of fifteen teachers, and was
the first of the group to reach Palo
Alto. He gave to the new Univer
sity enthusiasm, devotion, un
swerving loyalty. His work, his
character, his influence had from
the first the invaluable quality of
steadfastness. No shock of the un
expected, no reverse, 110 tedious
night of waiting shook his purpose
or resolution or faith. There was
borne in upon all who worked with
him his transparent simplicity, his
modesty, his tact, his unobtrusive
mastery. It was early recognized
that Dr. Richardson was one of the
strong men of Stanford, one in
whom the spirit of the University
was admirably exemplified. We
are poorer by the loss of a friend
and comrade, an inspiring presence.
We are richer by that friendship
and comradeship and by an in
fluence which somehow, we believe,
will abide in the Stanford charac
ter, so long as one stone of these
quadrangles shall remain upon
another.
Mr. Nash's early association with
the University was recalled as
tutor of Leland Stanford, Jr., as
confidential secretary to Sena
tor Stanford, as not inactive
when the first inceptions of
the University were taking
shape. He was also interpreter be
tween the founders and the Uni
versity they had set .in motion,
when there was need of interpreta
tion, and the service he was thus
able to render was not small. The
invitation to become a part of the
University, the opportunity to con
tribute something directly to its
life and advancement, never came
to anyone with more joy than to
him. Unduly conscious of his own
lack of specific training, self
distrustful and sensitive to the last
degree, he yet accepted the respon
sibilities of his position with a
noble seriousness, and without the
remotest thought of other claim to
consideration than his ability to
make himself useful.
"To all, Mr. Nash was affable,
courteous, and kindly. His ex
treme modesty and shyness, with
a certain formality of manner, for
bade that immediate and hearty
fellowship which some natures
command. To this, and to his
precario henlth, is due the fact
that he entered less into the com
mon life of our community than
have many others. And yet, so
long as his strength permitted, he
was astonishingly active in ways
that contributed not a little to the
pleasure and profit of us all. Those
who came into more intimate rela
tions with him found no diminish
ing of the sensitiveness, the high -
mindedness, the perfect gentleman
liness of his character. They
found also a broad culture, a keen
mind, a rich and responsive nature.
So wa were proud of his friendship;
so we honor his memory, and
reverently inscribe his name on the
University's sadly lengthening
Roll of Honor."
Mr, Dodge, said in part: "It was
my good fortune to have been as
sociated with Mr. Nash in the Uni
versity Library for the last few
months before lie went South.
From the time 1 received my first
letter from him 1 knew that here
was true courtesy and a true gen
tleman. There is another quality
so exemplified in the life of our
friend that I wish to mention it.
Mr. Nash was a true hero. The ac
cident which befell him some years
ago was the result of an heroic at
tempt to save the lives of others.
And during all the intervening
years, those who knew him best
and saw his bodily vigor gradually
fail, always knew that the heroic
will was in the ascendency."
Dr. Abbott spoke of the self-effac
ing spirit of Mr. Nash. "In the
organization of the University, and
in the most difficult problems which
came up in the course of its admin
istration," he said, "Dr. Nash's loy
alty, devotion, and sound advice
was the greatest help to the found
ers. His services were of the high
est value, and will always be re
membered with admiration and
gratitude."
Mrs. Mary Roberts Smith sang a
solo, and the exercises closed with
the anthem, "Bow Down Thine Ear,
0 Lord," rendered by a quartet.
The memorial service held last
evening in the chapel in honor of
Professor George Mann Richardson
and Librarian Herbert C. Nash
was attended by many of their
friends among the student body
and among the faculty.
President Jordan presided and
spoke briefly of the relations of the
two men to the University and of
the services they had rendered. He
was followed by Prof. Stillman,
Prof. Angela, Prof. Abbott, Dr. El
liott and Associate Librarian
Dodge.
Dr. Stillman spoke of Professor
Richardson especiallyfrom his many
years of fellowship with him,saying:
"It is a sad service that brings our
University community together
this evening to give formal expres
sion of our sense of losb in the gen
tle and noble lives that have gone
from us. In the few minutes at my
disposal I may speak especially of
my immediate associate and friend,
George Mann Richardson. Let me
bear public testimony to the admi
ration and affection inspired in me
as in all who knew him, by the
wisdom, the courage, the honesty,
and the kind and loyal heart of our
departed colleague.
"During the ten years of his ac
tive work at Stanford he has been
one of the most influential mem
bers of those committees which
have had most responsible and dif
ficult duties, and was thus known
widely beyond his department
work. His own experience and
participation in athletic affairs
made him a wise counsellor in the
athletic relations of the University.
The arduous labors connected with
the necessary work of department
administration left him little time
for the work of laboratory research,
particularly as the many years of
hampered finances exacted much
labor from him which would usu
ally be entrusted to subordinate
officials. His original research
work was consequently limited in
volume though excellent in quality.
Papers embodying the results
of investigations by Professor Rich
ardson have appeared in the prin
cipal chemical journals of this
country.
"Circumstances of outer condition
limited Dr. Richardson's labors as
an investigator in these pioneer
years of our University, but his
efficiency as a teacher had full
opportunity. Few men have the
faculty of holding both the respect
and devotion of students such as
he possessed. Simple in his
method and straightforward, he
found his way to the open heart of
youth. His simple, kindly nature
attracted his students, and his
scholarship retained their interest.
"Wise in counsel, calm and clear
in judgment, patient and consider
ate of other opinions, but with abso
lute honesty and fearless independ
ence; with high ideals of life and
University development, his influ
ence in the foundation period of the
University has been of the great
est value. The influence of Pro
fessor Richardson permeates the

traditions of the University, a be
nificent presence."
Dr. Angell spoke of the wide
influence exercised hy Dr. Richard
son. He said, "I believe Dr. Rich
ardson almost more than any other
man in the faculty may be said to
have had the Stanford spirit."
