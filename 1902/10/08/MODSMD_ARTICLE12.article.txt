The effort of the Plug Ugly
Committee to present the play on
the 16th will call for the most con
sistent and united work on the
part of the cast and the class in
general. The plugs will have to
be decorated within the next few
days if there is to be anything like
a representative turnout. Last
year the performance was post
poned once or twice, and was finally
given without preparation. If '04
wishes to escape a similar experi
ence there can be no further delay
in active work.
