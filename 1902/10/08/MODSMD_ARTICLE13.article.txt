In light of the fact that the
competition for songs and yells
comes to a close tonight, the follow
ing suggestion may not seem im
pertinent: At Berkeley it is the
custom to submit the songs en
tered in the contest to the bleach
ers and to let them choose the one
which contains the most of appeal.
Here the exact contrary has been
in vogue. The rooters have waited
until the printed books have been
placed in their hands, and have
had no part to play other than
that of singing a song in the selec
tion of which they have had no
ciioice. Each method has its dis
advantages. A combination of the
two, which will utilize the best in

each, is what we wish to suggest.
If the judges would submit the dif
ferent songs to the bleachers, while
still exerting the final right of
choice, they would he able to deter
mine, as in no other way, the value
of the song. In the end the bleach
ers will in any event be the final
board of decision.
