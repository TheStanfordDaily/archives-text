# Richmond Tract Chosen.
## 
### 
The management has at last se
cured grounds on which the inter
collegiate football games will be
played. On the Richmond tract,
out beyond the old Haight street
grounds, the Freshmen will line up
next week against their Berkeley

opponents. The grounds are leased
from Dave Brown, '97. He is at
present rushing the grounds into
shape. The soil is sandy, and with
a liberal sprinkling of water a few
days before the games, will make a
very good gridiron. Covered
bleachers will extend the full length
of the field on one side as a pro
tection against inclement weather.
Admission to the Freshman
game will be $1. Tickets will be
placed on sale the first of next
week and may be obtained on the
campus at the Bookstore.
