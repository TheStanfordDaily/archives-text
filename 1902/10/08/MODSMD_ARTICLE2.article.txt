# SOPHOMORE ENTERTAINMENT.
## Naught-Five Plans a Minstrel Show to Raise Funds for the Tennis Court. 
### 
At a meeting of the committee
chosen by the Sophomore class to
plan an entertainment for the ben
efit of the new tennis court, this
afternoon, it was decided that a
minstrel show would be of more
profit than a circus. The date set
for the show is Oct. 31st. As it is
but a week before the Intercollegi
ate football game, it serves as a
football rally also.
Talent will be drawn from the
whole student body, but will con
sist mainly of Sophomores. Both
Glee Clubs will entertain, and mu
sic will also be furnished by the
Orchestra and Band, led by
Mr. Scott Brook. Byrne will be
heard in monologue; Firebaugh
will sing; Baker and Bush will ap
pear in specialties; and Waldemar
Young and Jack Bonnell will fur
nish the flourishes. The rest of the
fun is to be supplied by a large
chorus of Sophomores.
The men will be assigned to their
places at once, and rehearsals are
to commence immediately. A josh
poster for the show is already Le
ing prepared. The finances will be
handled by Manager Edwards.
