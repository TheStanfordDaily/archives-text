# Freshmen vs. Santa Clara.
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Freshman
team will line up againÃŸt the eleven
from Santa Clara College. With
the exception of the match with
Hoitt's next Wednesday, this is
the last game which the Fresh
men will play before the intercol
legiate contest on the 18th. The
Berkeley Freshmen played Santa
Clara a tie game in which neither
side scored. Santa Clara was on
the defensive throughout the game,
and had it not been for the loose
team-work of the Freshmen the
game would have been a victory
for them. Last Saturday Belmont
and Santa Clara tied in a 0-0
game. With a record which so far
shows only one victory, the Fresh
men will play fiercely to ensure
a defeat of the Catholic college
men. The line-up will be:
FRESHMEN. SANTA CLAKA.
