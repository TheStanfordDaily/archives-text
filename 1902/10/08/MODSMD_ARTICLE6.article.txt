The Young Women's Christian
Association is about to organize a
new department—that of practical
philanthropy. The work will he
under the charge of Miss Kalhryn
Homer Kip. During the past sum
mer Miss Kip visited a number of
charitable associations of San
Francisco, and acquainted herself
witli the work and needs there.
The plan of the work here is to es
tablish a receiving and distributing
center, —to make a connection, so
to speak, between the clothing,
books, etc., which are thrown aside
here, and the actual needs of the
poor in San Francisco. This is the
starting-point, to which other
features will be added later.
The department is rapidly being
organized and it is hoped will be in
running order by the first of No
vember. Meanwhile, anyone hav
ing books, magazines, clothing, or
in fact anything to give away will
be doing a great favor by notifying
Miss Kip, either by mail or in per
son.
The work of collection and as
sortment will be in the hands of
the Y. \V. C. A. The committees
have not been appointed as yet, but
anyone having a special desire to
aid in this practical work is re
quested to give her name to Miss
Kip.
