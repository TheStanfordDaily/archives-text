# TRIP FOR THE MANDOLIN CLUB.
## Itinerary Will Embrace Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. 
### 
The question of whether the musi
cal clubs are to take a trip this yen r
was definitely settled last night
when representatives of the clubs
accepted the proposition of the Ex
ecutive Committee, at the regular
meeting of the latter. Since the
meeting, active steps have already
been taken in preparation for the
journey, and Treasurer Edwards is
in San Francisco today arranging
for the advertising. The trip is to
be to the north, and will be her
alded by Advance Agent Frank W.
Morrison, '97, who acted in the
same capacity last year when the
clubs went South. He is at pres
ent in Alaska, but will start for
here the latter part of this month,
and canvass the cities on his way
down.
It is the present intention to
leave the University about Decem
ber 16th, and the first appearance
will be at either Sacramento or
Stockton. The further itinerary in
Northern California is undecided,
but will probably embrace Marys
ville, Oroville, and Redding. The
Btops outside the state as figured on
now are Salem, Portland, Olympia,
Tacoma, Seattle, Everett, Belling
ham Bay, Vancouver, and Victoria.
The path of the clubs thus follows
practically the itinerary of 1895,
when the combined clubs of Cali
fornia and Stanford tried the exper
iment, and 1898, the last year that
the Stanford organization went
North. Three weeks' time will be
taken for the trip.
The combined Glee and Mando
lin Clubs will comprise about
twenty-eight. They are in better
shape than ever before. Very few
new men have been successful in
the try-outs, and consequently the
musicians will face the Northern
audiences with an organization
composed almost entirely of veter
ans. Some new ideas are promised
to be introduced into the program,
and one that is already assured
positive success is the banjo quin
tette which will undoubtedly form
the nucleus of a permanent banjo
club.
Baker and Bush are fixtures in
the specialty list, while others who
wish to try for the specialties will
be given an opportunity soon at a
try-out to be conducted by the
leaders and managers of the club
and by Instructor L. E. Bassett.
