There seems to be a misunder
standing among the new students
regarding the qualifications for
membership in the Freshman De
bating Society, and to this cause
may be traced the comparatively
small membership of the club. All
Freshmen, including special stu
dents, are entitled to membership,
and the only red tape in the process
is that of signing one's name to the
constitution. It is to be desired
that all Freshmen who can debate
or wish to learn to debate turn out
to the meetings. A start cannot be
made too soon. The club has al
ready proved that it contains good
debating material, but beyond a
doubt there is more that may be
added.
