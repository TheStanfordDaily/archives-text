The announcement that the mu
sical clubs will journey northward
at Christmas meets with the same
degree of approval from the stu
dent body at large as from the
club members themselves. Time
was when a jaunt of this nature
was looked upon as a doubtful
proposition, financially and in an
artistic sense. But the success of
the organizations on their trip last
year was so marked, their prompt
itude in meeting their obligations
so unusual, that there will be no
two opinions concerning the fitness
of the contemplated enterprise.
And it is well that the manage
ment has decided to vary the pro
gram of the past few years by mak

iug Northern cities the objective
points. Stanford has many loyal
sons and daughters in Oregon and
Washington, who will give the mu
sicians a rousing welcome. The
cluhs commence the season with
brilliant prospects; it would seem
that an opportunity is offered them
of making this a record year.
