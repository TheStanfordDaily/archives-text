It has become necessary to re
mind some of those who listen to
the organ on Sunday afternoons
that quiet should be preserved
throughout the Church during the
playing. Annoyance is caused
both to the musician and to the
listeners by persons coming in late
and wandering around the Church,
or going up to the organ gallery.
Last Sunday the organist was in
terrupted more than once in this.
Visitors are welcome in the loft,
but not late comers.
