by Irene A. Wright, '04, and Fred
H. Fowler, '04, the first original
farce in a foreign language yet to
be presented by the students of any
college in the country. The inter
est of the farce centers about the
fact that Lorenzo, who is in love
with Clarita and woos her accord
ing to the methods disclosed in
Calderon's dramas, is put to rout
by Hak Hones, a Spanish major
and Tertuliano, of Stanford, who is
aided by suggestions from Professor
Ramsey's text-books.

ments; but the project was given up
in view of the fact that an accept
able original production was
offered.
