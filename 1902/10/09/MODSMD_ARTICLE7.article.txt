# Freshmen and Second Team.
## 
### 
The Varsity candidates were
given an easy practice last night,
and then the field was cleared for a
hard scrimmage between the Fresh
men and the Second Team. Every
effort is being used to put the Fresh
men into shape for the intercollegi
ate game, now only nine days off.
The new combination of backs is
decidedly better than any previ
ously tried. Shine, who played
center during the first part of the
season, is being played at full-back.
Although the position is new to
him, and he is deficient in a knowl
edge of formations, he will prove
invaluable as soon as the rough
spots wear off. He hits the line
hard, and is good on defense.
Esles has been sent to right guard
and Bryan shifted from his old
place at guard to center. The
changing of these men has strength
ened both the backs and the line
very materially. Cooper lined up
at end last night, and Scoville, who
showed up so well for the '99 team,
was tried at full-back on the Sec
ond. The Freshmen line held the
Second for downs repeatedly, and
gained heavily on Mngee's punts,
but they were not able to make
their distance consistently. Scho

field and Preston at ends both did
good work.
Quarter back is the most uncer
tain and perhaps the weakest place
on the team. Spellman, Litt, and
Cutler are all being tried, Litt
uses the best headwork in giving
his signals but is weak in passing
the ball.
