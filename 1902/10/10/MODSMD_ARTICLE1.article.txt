# VARSITY AND RELIANCE.
## Second Game With the Big Clubmen is Scheduled for Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Varsity
lines up against the husky Reliance
clubmen for the second of the three
games to be played between the
two. The optimism which the sup
porters of the Cardinal felt at Stan
ford's first victory by a score of
12-0 was somewhat dampened when
Reliance was completely outplayed
at Berkeley last Saturday, and de
feated by a score of 16-0. The
latter score, however, was in no
way indicative of the superiority of
the University of California eleven.
The development of the past two
weeks will undoubtedly enable the
Varsity to run up a larger score
than in the first contest, although
the club players have been getting
in some telling pactice of late. The
probable line-up will be:
VARSITY. RELIANCE.
