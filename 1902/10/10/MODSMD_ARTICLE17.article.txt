The idea of establishing here a
Museum of the scope and dimen
sions of that planned by Mrs.
Stanford, seems in keeping with
the cosmopolitan nature and far
reaching influence of the Univer
sity. The province of the Stan
ford Museum is unlimited, its
opportunities unmeasured. But
above all things, while exemplify
ing the cosmopolitan spirit of the
University, it should be distinct
ively Western in type. The West
ern frontier, Western development,
the Aztec, the Indian, California,
and the Pacific Coast should be
represented as in no other building
in the world. The time for action
is fast going by. There are in the
State many private collections of
manuscripts, of the days before the
Spanish occupation, mission re
mains, and articles of like nature,
all of which should be gathered to
gether in one place. Stanford em
ulates the Spanish architecture.
What more fitting than that the
Stanford Museum, in the center of
the land of the padre, should be
the repository for those relics
which bear most closely on West
ern history.
