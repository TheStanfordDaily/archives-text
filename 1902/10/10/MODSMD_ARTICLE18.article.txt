That the trainer should be
obliged to voice such sentiments
as he expressed at the close of the
game yesterday, is a reproach to
every Freshman football man on
the field. Yet the rebuke was well
merited. Such a state of affairs
might seem less reprehensible were
the intercollegiate game not
eight days in the future. But with
only a week and one day separat
ing them from the most desperate
struggle of their lives, it must be to
the players' lasting shame that they
should have failed to put them
selves into the best possible condi
tion. If a team uses every means

at its command to ensure success,
win or lose, it deserves the admira
tion of all; if through any negli
gence of its own it reaches the
crucial moment with inadequate
resources, it has failed in a test of
honor. It behooves every man in
the squad to realize the seriousness
of his position and do everything
in his power to so qualify himself
that the contest with California
will not be the one-sided one to
which present conditions seem to
point.
