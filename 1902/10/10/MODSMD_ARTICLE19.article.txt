### 
The Stanford Alumnus for Octo
ber, under a new board of editors,
has appeared, improved in every
department. There is the usual
chronicle of faculty changes, the
improvements on the campus, the
gist of important news of the Uni
versity, and the athletic situation.
An effort will be made this year to
increase the importance of the
"Alumni" department of the maga
zine, in order that it may be as
complete as possible. It is an
nounced that each number will
contain a full-page engraving of
some view of Greater Stanford.
