# Moulton Scores Freshmen.

### 
At the close of the game with
Santa Clara last evening Trainer
Moulton had something to say
about the physical condition of the
eleven. "The condition of the men,"
said he,"was nothing short of
criminal at this time of the sea
son. Men were down at every
rush, and nearly every man on the
team was playing for wind. There
was none of that snap and life in
the Freshmen which will enable a
team in good physical condition to
stand the hardest kind of a foot
ball game with but little exhaus
tion as the result. And yet there
is absolutely no excuse for such a
state of affairs. The Freshmen
have received more attention at the
hands of the trainer and the rub
bers than the Varsity men them
selves."
Continuing, "Dad" said that late
hours was the only reason he could
give for the poor condition of the
team. "It has come under my
personal observation," he affirmed,
"that candidates for the Freshman
football team have been running
around at eleven and twelve o'clock
when they should have been in bed
by ten. If the Freshmen continue
to disobey training-rules and stay
up at night, any man detected will
be put off the field, even if he is the
strongest man on the team. I will
have a team of decently condi
tioned men, if the best material on
the eleven must be sacrificed."
