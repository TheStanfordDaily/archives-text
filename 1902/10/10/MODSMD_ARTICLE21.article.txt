### 
Tuesday evening next Mrs. Jose
phine It. Itogers will read Stephen
Phillips' tragedy, "Paola and Fran
cesca," in the University chapel.
This play, the author's first, was
published three years ago. It at
tracted considerable attention as a
literary production. Last winter
it was staged successfully in Lon
don. It is essentially a drama of
passion. Interest does not center
so much in the characters as in the
part each plays in the great
struggle of emotion. The drama
deals with experiences that stir the
depth of human feeling and reveal
the unmeasured power of human
emotion. Herein rests its signifi
cance and interest.
Mrs. Itogers is the wife of F. J.
Itogers of the Physics department.
This is her first public appearance
here, though she has read the play
in various cities in the East during
the past year. The Eastern papers
speak in high terms of her inter
pretation, and mention particularly
her naturalness, simplicity and
dramatic powers.
