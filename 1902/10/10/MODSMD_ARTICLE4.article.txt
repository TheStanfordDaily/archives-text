# HEAD COACH TALKS.
## Clemens Is Satisfied with Varsity and Freshman Teams. Chances for the Game. 
### 
When questioned concerning the
football outlook this afternoon
Coach Clemens was reluctant to
indulge in any positive remarks
about the make-up of either the
Varsity or the Freshman team.
"It is entirely too early in the sea
son," he said, "to make any state
ment concerning our probable line
up against Berkeley. As a whole,
however, the development of Varsi
ty candidates has been satisfactory,
their team-work is good, and their
spirit admirable.
"One thing, however, needs cor
rection. The number of men on
the field is entirely too small.
There is a great deal of good foot
ball material in college which has
never appeared on the gridiron,
when the necessity for a stronger
second team is so apparent."
Clemens said the outlook for a
Varsity intercollegiate victory is
not discouraging, although the
fight will certainly be a hard one.
About the Freshmen the head
coach was not so optimistic. He
did not express himself as being
dissatisfied with the progress of the
youngsters, but regretted that they
were not in better physical condi
tion.
"They are expected to give a
good account of themselves against
Berkeley," he said, "and should
fortune not be against them they
should stand a good chance of win
ning the first intercollegiate con
test."
Clemens has directed the second
team during the past week. Sla
ker has remained behind the Var
sity, and Professor Lewers has de
voted himself to the Freshmen.
Murphy and Kohn have also had
a hand in the coaching.
