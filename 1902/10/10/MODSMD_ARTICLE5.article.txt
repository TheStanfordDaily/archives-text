## 
### 
Previous to the Santa Clara-'O6
match yesterday afternoon, the
Freshman squad unanimously
elected William P. Magee to the
captaincy of the team that will
meet California on the 18th.
Magee is a physiology major
from Fallbrook, Cal., and entered
Stanford from Santa Clara College,
where he has achieved distinction
on three successive elevens. In
1899 he played full-back on the
team which defeated the '03 Fresh
men of Stanford. He was captain
that year and again last season,
lie has gained the reputation of
being a sure ground-gainer and the
equal it) punting ability of any
man on the Coast. At Santa Clara
his position was full-back; with
the Freshmen he is playing left
half.
