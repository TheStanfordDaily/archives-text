The resolutions recently passed
by the Stanford Club of Portland
were called forth principally by
the visit of a baseball team pur
porting to be made up of alumni of
various colleges but which was ad
vertised as the "Stanford team,"
all posters being headed with the
Stanford yell. The fact that such
actions are possible is certainly to
be deplored by every one who has
the interests of Cardinal athletics
at heart. But when people outside
the University represent themselves
as Stanford men, we see no remedy
except that suggested by the atti
tude already held by the Athletic
Committee. Whatever censorship
is advisable is certainly exercised.
Last spring some of Stanford's un
dergraduate baseball players were
offered the Northern trip, but re
fused when informed by Dr. Angell
that such proceedings would mean
the prohibition of their taking part
in Stanford athletics again.
The resolutions seem to desire
that no class-teams or second
teams be allowed to go on trips.
It is true that relatively inefficient
aggregations have been advertised
as "Stanford" teams, but so far as
we know this has always been the
fault of the manager at the other
end of the line. The part of the
resolution asking that the alumni
be notified of prospective trips sug
gests a remedy.

Prof. Farrand on College Spirit.
Professor Max Farrand, head of
the History department, spoke to
the students of the University of
California at their bi-weekly meet
ing in the Harmon gymnasium on
Friday morning. His subject was
"College Spirit," and among other
things he said: "What has been
termed the 'lack of clubable spirit'
in California will account for the
absence or weakness of college
spirit in Berkeley and Stanford;
for there is such a weakness in the
two universities. The trouble is
that there is too much independ
ence in this State. It is a natural
fault here in the West, but it must
be overcome before there can be
true unity. The great fundamental
principle for you, as students, is to
stand by your college first, last and
all the time. Protect the univer
sity's name. Brand that man as a
traitor who air√ü its faults and ad
vertises its weaknesses. Such men
ought to be run out of the uni
versity."
