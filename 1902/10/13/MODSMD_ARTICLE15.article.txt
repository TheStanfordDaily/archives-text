# Improvements in Memorial Court.
## 
### 
Contracts were let this morning
to the Goodman Stone Company
for the construction of concrete
walks in the Memorial Court and
the graveling of the intermediate
spaces. There are to be four lines
of asphalt pavement, one twelve
feet wide extending from the large
arch to the main arch of the inner
quad, and another of the same
size east and west from the arcades
to the Stanford group. There are
in addition to be walks six feet
wide running diagonally to the
group from the four corners of the
arcades. Ornamental bronze fig
ures will be stationed in the four
corners of the court. These figures
were purchased by Mrs. Stanford
during her visit to Japan the past
summer. It is the intention that,
the court will be entirely completed
inside of four weeks.
