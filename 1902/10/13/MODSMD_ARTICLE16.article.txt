At the chapel yesterday morning
Rev. R. M. Webster took for his
text Joshua 24:15. In part he said:
"Joshua decided that to serve God
he must be perfectly just and en
tirely kind. I assume that you are
at one with Joshua in that regard.
There may be an agnostic among
you. I would call his attention to
one fact: it is entirely sane and
wise to be honest with the depths
of one's soul, and if there be a God
he would be pleased by a person
being just and kind."
