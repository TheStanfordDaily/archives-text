# Reliance Defeated.
## 
### 
While the University of Califor
nia was engaged in pling up the
score of 44 to 0 against the disor
ganized Alumni team, Stanford
busied herself last Saturday in ad
ministering a bare defeat of 12-0
to the Reliance Athletic Club.
Reliance still showed a lack of
team-work and suffered from poor
physical condition, but put up a
good, scrappy fight. Stanford
ecored once in each half, and Cap
tain Lee was successful in kicking
both goals. For the first five min
utes of play Reliance seemed to
have a little the best of it, but after
an exchange of punts Stanford
sent Clark, Magee, and Dole around
the Reliance ends for good gains.
Once within striking distance of
the goal, the ball was bucked over
by short gains through the guards
and tackles. Again during the
half Stanford had the ball inside
the Reliance five-yard line, but lost
it on a fumble, allowing the club
men to punt to safety before the
whistle blew to end the half.
Magee, Dole, and Hamilton gave
way to Smith, Scoville, and Doherty
behind the line in the second half.
Long runs by Bartell and Smith
were the features of the half.
Pounding at the line through
guards and tackles, brought
the ball well down the field, where
Scoville was pushed over for an
other touchdown.
At end Stanford was strongest.
Clark and Bartell played brilliant
games at defence and carried the
ball successfully, while Butterfield
also played a star game. Behind
the line the backs all did good
work. The line was the strongest
of the season. The line-up:
Reliance —Zann, r e; S. Plank,
