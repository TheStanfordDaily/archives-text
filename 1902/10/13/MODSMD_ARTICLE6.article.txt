# Mrs. Rogers Will Read.
## 
### 
Tomorrow evening at 7:30 Mrs.
Rogers will read Stephen Phillips'
"Paolo and Francesca" in the
chapel. Her readings in the East
last year called forth very flatter
ing comments from the press, one
of which, from the Saginaw Eve
ning Herald, is as follows:
"Mrs. Rogers displayed rare
dramatic talent in her rendition of
this difficult production. The
greatest charm of her work, per
haps, was her naturalness. The
characters stepped out of the book
and lived, struggled, and suffered
before the listeners. There was
heart as well as art in the recital."
No admission fee is charged, as
the entertainment is part of the
regular Tuesday evening course.
