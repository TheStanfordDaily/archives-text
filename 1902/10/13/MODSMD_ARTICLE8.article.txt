# APPEAL TO FACULTY.
## Portland Alumni Enter Forcible Protest Against So-called Stanford Teams. 
### 
At the regular meeting of the
Stanford University Club of Port
land, held on October 3d, resolu
tions were unanimously adopted
which set forth in no uncertain
terms the views of the alumni re
garding phases of the University
athletic policy. They were called
forth principally by a visit to Port
land last summer of an aggregation
of baseball players—ostensibly an
"alumni" nine, but advertised by
the local club with which it com
peted as the Stanford team. The
text is as follows:
Whereas, During the last few
years various athletic teams repre
senting Stanford University have
come to Portland; and
Whereas, In our opinion said
teams have not fairly represented
the best athletic ability of the Uni
versity; and
Whereas, We believe that it is
a positive detriment to Stanford
University to permit any team to
leave the campus which is not the
best the University can turn out,
and then only after a reasonable
amount of preparatory practice; and
Whereas, Various teams have
visited this city, purporting to be
Stanford teams, or designedly trav
elling under such names as tend
to convey the impression that they
are teams from Stanford Univer
sity, when in reality they were in
no way representative of the Uni
versity; and
Whereas, From observation we
believe that a tour made by a team
staying a long time away from the
campus, playing games at many
points, is demoralizing to the mem
bers of the team, and detrimental
to the University; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we, the Stanford
University Club of Portland, Ore
gon, respectfully call the attention
of the Athletic Committee to the
following recommendations, to
wit:
First. —That no athletic team be
permitted to leave the University
unless it be the very best which
that part of the University it rep
resents can furnish, and unless it
has been successful in its annual
contest with University of Califor
nia.
Second. —That no team be per
mitted to leave the University with
out notice being given by the chair
man of the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee to the secretary of the Alum
ni Association where the team is to
play. In case there is no local asso
ciation then the notice should be to
some alumnus, or to some one hav
ing the interest of the University at
heart.
Third. —That no team be per
mitted to leave the campus to make
a protracted "tour."
Fourth.—That the holding out
of trips aB an inducement to get
men to try for positions on the
team be discouraged.
Fifth. —That no student eligible
to a University team be permitted,
while so eligible, to represent an
outside club, or organization, or to
take trips with such club or organ
ization.
