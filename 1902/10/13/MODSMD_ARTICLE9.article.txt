air "Vive la Compagnie," was the
second choice. There were eight
songs submitted to the committee.
The competition for the yell was
reopened, as none of those handed
in were considered suitable. The
words of the prize song follow:
I.
We have seen our brawny heroes
chase poor Berkeley down the
field,
We have felt the mighty triumph
of a team that would not yield,
And we raise our voices -shouting,
California's doom is sealed,
As we go marching on.
Chorus.
Down then, down with California,
Down then, down with California,
Down then, down with California,
Oh, down with old U. C.
11.
We have watched our team buck
through them, and heard the
bleacher's roar,
We have listened to a thousand
voices counting up the score;
Everything is Blue at Berkeley, for
they have their Gold no more,
As we go marching on!
111.
Now tell us, did you see McGilvray
plunging through those holes?
And did you watoh McFadden, lit
tle Bansie, and the DoleB?
Oh, could you hear Doc. Jordan yell
when Tubby kicked the goals?
As we went marching on!
IV.
Here's three times three for Captain
Lee â€”skyrocket for the team!
All honor to the men who woke old
Berkeley from her dream.
And they'll get a rousing welcome
where the Stanford bonfires gleam,
When we go marching home.
