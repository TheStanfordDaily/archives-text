Every undergraduate who re
ceives an invitation to the Alumni
smoker in San Francisco on Friday
night should make it a point to at
tend, if time and circumstances
will possibly permit. The occasion
falls on the eve of the Freshman
game, and enough students ought
to he already in the city to make a
strong undergraduate representa
tion. It has heen the experience
of colleges that the alumni are
their strongest friends, a rule to
which Stanford is certainly no ex
ception. But for some reason the
bond between the old student and
the undergraduate has not seemed
so close as it should have heen.
A cause frequently assigned is the
lack of opportunity for the alumni
and undergraduates to meet on
equal terms. The Seniors last
commencement tendered a smoker
to the old students, which was only
partly successful because it was not
attended by a sufficient number.
This obstacle will be lacking in the
reception of Friday night. The
alumni have expressed a desire to
bring about a more intimate ac
quaintance and a more cordial re
lationship between the Old and
the New of Stanford. The oppor
tunity is one which it were well to
embrace.
