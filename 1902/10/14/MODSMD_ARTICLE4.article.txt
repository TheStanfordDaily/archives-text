Owing to the poor showing the
so-called Alumni team made
against California last Saturday,
Manager Edwards has decided to
cancel the Varsity-Alumni game of
Friday and substitute a game with
Santa Clara College. Santa Clara
has a heavy, well-conditioned
eleven, and should put up a strong
fight against the Varsity. Their
superiority over the Freshmen was
evident enough to insure a harder
game for the Varsity than the
Alumni could furnish.
