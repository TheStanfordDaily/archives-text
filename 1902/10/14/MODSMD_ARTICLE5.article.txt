# Freshmen Win from Hoitt's.
## 
### 
Through a lucky scratch the
Freshmen managed to win from
Hoitt's this afternoon by a count
6-0. The only score was made
early in the second half,when Magee
punted to the Hoitt fifteen-yard
line and recovered the ball on a
fumble. The hall was bucked over
by Magee, Preston, and Shine, and
Magee kicked the goal, Hoitt's,
although outweighed, played a
fierce game against their heavier
opponents, hut were unable to buck
the Freshman line with consistency.
The Stanford line offered little
help to its backs on the offence,
however, allowing Hoitt's to get
through and tackle before
the Stanford runners were started.
The backs were slow on their feet
and did not hit the line with speed
or energy. Five minutes before
the end of the game the babies
braced and played hard football,
but were unable to score.
