# JUNIOR CELEBRATION.
## Rehearsals of Naught-Four Plug Ugly Point to Successful Entertainment. 
### 
The Juniors held a full rehearsal
of the I'lug Ugly this afternoon in
the Assembly Hall. The results
were promising, as everything went
off with a vim and dash. About a
hundred Juniors were present, be
sides the acting cast, and the songs
were sung with success. Accord
ing to those who have attended the
rehearsals, the 1904 Plug Ugly will
be one of the most successful ever
given here. The two leading parts
are taken by Waldemar Young
and Cleveland Baker, who were
seen to such advantage in the 1903
Junior Farce. Their parts are full
of striking local hits. The farce is
reeking with joshes on local people.
The music is especially catching.
All the songs are written to pecul
iar airs, and are sure to he received
with enthusiasm. The committee
has promised that the pyrotechnic
effects will be unusually brilliant.
In the matter of attendance the
Junior celebration will undoubtedly
be a record-breaker. All the sur
rounding towns have been adver
tised with dodgers and posters, and
the indications point to the bleach
ers being taxed to their fullest ca
pacity. The class will have a full
dress rehearsal on the oval Wednes
day night, and also in the Assem
bly Hall in the afternoon at one
o'clock. It is imperative that all
Juniors be present at both these re
hearsals.
