# Tomorrow's "Sequoia."
## 
### 
The third number of the Sequoia
will appear tomorrow, and it is an
unusually good number. R. E.
Renaud, '03, whose verse work is
well known to Sequoia readers, ven
tures into the field of prose with a
Stanford story entitled "Shut
Out." For delicateness of touch
and imagery, and for subjective
handling of a theme purely object
ive, this is one of the best pieces of
work that the Sequoia bus yet pub
lished. Delmar M. Reynolds has
a charming child story, "The Mar
tyr," which is entertaining and
well handled. "Mrs. Merrill's
Holiday," a story of New England
country life, has a touch of pathos
that is genuine, and is a good
story. Another of T. E. Stephen
son's stories of the Southwest ap
pears under the title of "A Good
Time and Wine." Under the ini
tials N. N. F., a new Stanford
writer has a good story, apropos at

this time, called "When Stanford
Claims Her Own." The "Sketch
book" includes fragments by T. E.
Stephenson, C. M. L., Edith Spen
cer, and the editor. Verses are fur
nished by Tom Hodge, Hallett
Abend, A. H. R., and D. B. 1).
