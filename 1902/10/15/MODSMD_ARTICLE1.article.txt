The play, which is the work of
C. D. McComish, '03, opens when
Badlingo, King of Sophland, arrives
in camp with his followers on their
way to the State of Plugity. A
beautiful Fairy Queen soon ap
pears, and so pleases the people
with her apparent power to heal
their many mental and physical
ills, that they insist upon their
king marrying her. This the king
cannot do for reasons which he ex
plains to the people. The queen
leaves after foretelling the coming of
Hunwaddy, the Prophet, who will
complete their restoration to per
fection. Hunwaddy comes in his
chariot, interprets the signs, heals
all ills, and finally discovers in the
queen, who has returned to camp,
the long lost love of his youth.
After the reunion of Hunwaddy
and the queen the people perform
the mysterious ceremony which he
has taught them, and the action
comes to an end amid much sing
ing and rejoicing. "P. 0. P.," the
mystic letters of the Plug Ugly
poster, appear in the sky, and
much of the action centers about
the effort to discover a meaning
for them.
Profiting by the experience of
former classes, the dialogue of this
Plug Ugly has been shortened as
much as possible and the plot is
made to depend on the action and
the pyrotechnic effects. Red fire
will be used in great quantities, and
every effort will be made to trans
form Stanford for a night into the
personal property of the class.
