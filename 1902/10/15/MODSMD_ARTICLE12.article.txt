After the Plug Ugly tomorrow
night the Seniors will endeavor to
follow the time-honored custom of
smashing thenewly dedicated Junior
hats. This phase of the annual cel
ebration has been carefully re
stricted to the graduating class by
a well-worn tradition,and lest some
of the Sophomores forget this it is
well to remind them of the action
of 1904 in voluntarily refraining
from participation in this affair.
It is a happy custom that brings
the two upper classes together in a
good-natured contest. Nothing
would do more credit to their
6ense of the fitness of things than
that the Sophomores should appre
ciate the value and aims of the
custom.
