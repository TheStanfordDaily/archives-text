Tiie part which the alumni have
taken under the management of
J. T. Nourse, '00, in getting to
gether a team for the preliminary
football games was actuated purely
by interest in the universities, and
deserves the gratitude of every
undergraduate of Stanford and
California. Practice matches for
two Varsities are hard to obtain.
The alumni realize more than we
do that a source of weakness in
football on the Pacific Coast is the
lack of healthy competition. The
men who have been responsible for
the formation of the Alumni team
this season have given much of
their time taken from business,
and in other ways have sacrificed
their own interests for the good of
the Varsities. We have little op
portunity to sliovv our appreciation
of their efforts. Still less manifest
is the influence of their example
upon undergraduates. Yet that
the attitude of the alumni toward

their Alma Muter has much to do
with the vitality and perseverance
of college spirit is a fact that is
keenly realized, although too sel
dom expressed.
