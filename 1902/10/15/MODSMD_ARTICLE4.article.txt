# "Paolo and Francesca."
## 
### 
The few University people who
did not hear Mrs. Rogers' reading
of "Paolo and Francesca" in the
chapel last night have cause for
regret. For two hours an audi
ence of four hundred persons sat
enthralled by the power of Stephen
Phillips' tragedy and by the art of
the interpreter. And when the last
act was finished there came a burst
of spontaneous applause which re
fused to be quieted until long after
Mrs. Rogers had disappeared.
In simplicity of motive the
tragedy reminds one of Antigone
and Othello. Like these it is essen
tially a drama of passion. Inter
est does not center so much in the
characters as in the part each plays
in the great passion, which beats
itself out against the object that
arouses it. We care not so much
for Creon the king, as for Creon
the inexorable proclaimer of de
crees, not so much for Othello the
Moor, as for Othello the deceived
lover. In the play of "Paolo and
Francesca" we see little of Giovanni
the tyrant and soldier, but much
of Giovanni the man of
passion and vengeance. As
the play proceeds the emo
tion becomes more and more
intense, until it dominates the
man. His passion knows no re
straint, but drives him on to inev
itable disaster.
In the hands of Mrs. Rogers the
tragedy left little to be desired.
Her characters came straight from
the drama and stood before the
audience as living creations. Paolo
and Giovanni and Francesca in
turn, â€” she imparted to each a dis
tinct personality. Mrs. Rogers has
charmed audiences in great East
ern cities, but never scored a
greater triumph than before her
"ain people" in the University
chapel last night.
