# EXHIBITS FROM THE ORIENT.
## Large Number of Japanese Articles Placed in the Museum by Mrs. Stanford. 
### 
The Japanese collection in the
south rotunda of the Museum has
just been opened. It contains
several fine individual pieces,
and twelve cases, all very valuable
museum exhibits, and interesting
to the common observer as well as
to those well acquainted with the
Orient.
A magnificent and elaborately
marked koro (incense burner) four
teen feet in height, holding the posi
iton of honor beneath the dome,
has an interesting history, and is
an excellent example of the wonder
ful skill of the Japanese bronze
workers of the eighteenth century,
and of the artistic conceptions of
that period. Over a hundred years
ago the koro was made so that it
might be offered to Fudosa, the evil
slayer of Narita in the Shimosa
province, but was kept in a Jap
anese family until bought by Mrs.
Stanford a few months ago. The
whole design is taken from Bud
dhism, and to those who are
familiar with liuddhist philosophy
many subtle points of the religion
will be disclosed. The topmost
piece is an eagle spread for flight,
suggestive of wonderful bravery
and unsurmountable dignity.
Opposite the entrance is a piece
next in distinction. It is a power
ful Buddhist deity, Amida, made of
gilt wood with a lotus stand, and is
one hundred and fifty years old.
It came out of the Buddhist temple
"Choraknji," in a suburb of Kyoto.
On each side of this is a Buddhist
Goddess of Mercy, done in gilt
wood.
Another collection of Buddhist
curios, which has been put between
the pillars of the rotunda, contains
a fine Japanese gong, a drum, and
several articles used in worship,
and also representations of gods,
and temple bronze work.
In niches on the wall and on
stands seven Japanese vases, rang
ing from three to five feet in height,
of different designs and workman
ship, have been arranged.
The walls are hung with Jap
anese panels and draperies. The
panels are beautiful pieces of art.
The cases are ranged around the
edge of the rotunda and are filled
with Oriental curios and workman
ship. Some of the work exhibited
in them is quite modern, some of it
extending back several centuries.
In two of the cases are lacquered
trays, a style of work for which
Japan is noted. . They are deli
cately decorated and highly pol
ished. Vases and tea chests, tea
pots, images, boxes of various sorts
and of different materials, minia
ture copies of Buddha gods and
goddesses and dragons are among
the many curios. Perhapß the
most valuable of the lesser articles
is a tall Satsuma vase, presented
to Mrs. Stanford by Ikeda, a cele
brated collector of Japanese sub
jects, and which was made by a
potter brought from Korea in the
seventeenth century.
On* case contains some ivory
work that is exceptionally good.
The two main pieces are sections of

tusk on which have been carved
some intricate and finely executed
figures representing Minamoto-
Ushiwaka-Maru, a famous young
noble, and Jorurikime, the belle of
the East. These are said to have
taken seven years of work in their
finishing.
There are several photographs of
Mrs. Stanford, taken while in
Japan. One of these will be espec
ially interesting as it contains
several old Stanford students, both
Japanese and American.
In the passageway to the lower
room of the south wing is a case of
Hawaiian articles, and chief among
them is the monster "loving-bowl
given by the Stanford men and
women of Hawaii to Mrs. Stanford
at the banquet tendered her on
Aprill 28th of this year. The roll
of those present, a photograph of
the table, and other souvenirs of
the occasion have also been pre
served. The case contains several
good examples of Kanaka bead
work, carving and costume.
