# TERTULIA FARCE.
## The 						Spanish Club Habla Mucho Castellano at Roble Hall Last Evening. 
### 
One hundred and fifty guests of
the Club Tertulia crowded the par
lors at Roble last evening to see
the little skit written for the occa
sion by Miss J. A. Wright, '04, and
F. H. Fowler, '04. Although
"Calderon contra Ramsey" was
rehearsed and staged all within two
weeks, it was presented with great
success, even the hitch in the elope
ment scene adding to the fun. It is
not definitely announced, but it is
understood that the authors have a
sequel or two up their sleeves, even
more exciting than the delicate bit
of romance given last night.
The story as thus far developed
is that Jack Jones, a Stanford
Spanish major, having taken all
the courses offered, feels equal to a
trip into Mexico; but not relying
entirely on assimilated knowledge,
he prudently takes along a com
plete student's outfit of Professor
Ramsey's text-books, chief among
which appeared to be the "Stanford
Jolly," filled with suitable compli
mentary phrases. As a companion
volume, the intrepid Jack takes
''Spanish Quips Valiant," in order
to intimidate any jealous paisonos
which the other book might stir to
violence. Mr. Waldemar Young
represented the part to the life,
braved the drawn sword of the
jealous lover, and quailed only be
fore the charm of the young lady.
Mr. Fred Fowler as Lorenzo, the
Calderonian lover, was a superb
example of Castilian magnificence.
His poetic language and dazzling
costume under other circumstances
would have won out, but maidens
are fickle and Clarita could not re
sist the Americano when he told
her, in her own tongue, she was a
"peacherina" and other novel but
lovely things. Miss Kraft took the
part of the coquettish senorita very
prettily, and a feature of the occa
sion was her duet with Mr. Ira
Woods as Paco, the lazy husband
of Dona Concha. Dona Concha
was perfectly done by Miss Wright,
as was the Claudio of Mr. Stanley
Smith. Miss Roberts, Miss Stroud,
Mr. Powers, Mr. Sharpe and Mr.
Haver composed the orchestra, and
opened the performance with ap
propriate mandolin and guitar
selections. The scenery was skil
fully painted by Mr. H. 11. Johnson.
Misses Arqu6s, lbs and Hartnell
served punch during the reception
that followed the farce. Mesdames
Johnston, Ramsey, Matzke, Searles,
and Frein received the guests,
among whom were Dr. and Mrs.
Reid of Belmont, and Prof. Carlos
Bransby of Berkeley.
The farce has the unusual value
of being good reading as well as
being a good acting arrangement,
and real talent is evident from the
introduction of passages from
the stately Calderon's "La Vida
Ks Sueno" and other famous
dramas; these are mixed in with
the colloquialisms of Claudio and
Dona Concha, whose speeches
bristle with proverbs and idioms,
so that the whole is a rapid succes
sion of contrasted styles, very in
genious and laughable.
