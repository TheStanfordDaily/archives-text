We publish elsewhere the decis
ion of the Athletic Committee in
regard to the playing of Johnston
by Califoania. It may be that
after having their attention called
to it by Dr. Angell the Berkeley au
thorities have recognized the nel
igibility of the man in question. If
so, no intimation of the fact has
been received at Stanford, and
Johnston has continued playing
in the preliminary games. We do
not in any way wish to impugn
the motives of those who have
charge of affairs across the bay;
but when they willingly enter into
an agreement, —and it was sub
scribed to not so far in the past
that its stipulation or its spirit
can in any way be obscure, —
it certainly should be adhered to by
both parties. One infraction
going unchallenged would mean
a tendency towards numerous in
fractions by both Stanford and
California later on. We cannot
but commend the action of the
committee.
