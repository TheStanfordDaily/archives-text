The students of Wisconsin are
very seriously considering sending
their football team to the Pacific
Coast in the Christmas vacation to
play Stanford and California. The
Wisconsin Daily Cardinal goes so
far as to say that the games are a
certainty, although neither of the
California colleges has been con
sulted. In its issue of October 11th
the Cardinal says editorially:
The announcement that the foot
ball team will be taken to the
Pacific Coast during the Christmas
vacation will be received by the
undergraduates and alumni of the
university with approval. Chicago
and Michigan have each taken the
trip, and it is now fitting that Wis
consin should be given a chance to

show her strength on the Coast.
Such an arrangement will be
favored by all the friends of the
university for the standing it will
give Wisconsin in the Far West.
