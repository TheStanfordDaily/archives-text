—The Pennsylvania - Chicago
game has been given up on account
of the long distance that has to be
traveled in order to bring the
two teams together. There will
now be no big games between the
East and Middle West, as this was
the only one scheduled.
—The University of California
band has not appeared at any of
the games on the Berkeley campus
this year, owing to a dispute with
the student body management.
The members of the band have de
manded season tickets, promising
to play at "games that are worth
while," but the management fears
Betting a bad precedent.
—"The senior class at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania," says the
Wisconsin Cardinal, ''has passed a
resolution that all freshmen shall
wear black caps on the campus ex
cept on Sundays. The reason
given is that it is necessary to be
able to distinguish between the
classes in order to promote class
spirit. No class numerals are to
be worn except those won on some
class athletic team. The seniors
are determined to enforce their res
olutions."
