# The 						New " Sequoia."
## 
### 
It is getting to be the regular
thing this semester for each num
ber of the Sequoia to eclipse the
preceding issue. The stories have
already reached a higher standard,
covering as they do a wider field
and representing a larger number
of writers than before.
The third number appears today
with an editorial department en
larged to three pages and made up
of live comment on issues of inter
est to the Stanford community.
This feature adds much to the in
terest and value of the magazine.
