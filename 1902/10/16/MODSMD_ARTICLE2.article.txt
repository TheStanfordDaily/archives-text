# ART EXHIBITION.
## Many Paintings of Note from Brush of Instructor Noyes Placed on View in the Studio. 
### 
Instructor Noyes of the Drawing
department has just placed on view
in the Studio, near the Bookstore,
an exhibition of oil and water-color
paintings. The fifty or more pic
tures comprise subjects from Mex
ico, Venice, New England, and
even one or two from the Stanford
campus, all arranged in an excel
lent light. Mr. Noyes is a colorist,
and his landscapes are remarkable
for luminosity and radiance.
They are well painted and stimu
lating pictures, which reflect the
strong individual tastes, prefer
ences, and ambitions of the artist.
Many of these paintings have
been exhibited in the East and are
classed as quite on a par with the
best pictures by contemporary
American landscape painters. There

are studies of sand-dunes stretch
ing into the distance under the
misty ocean sunlight; pictures of
New England farms admirably
held in one tender tone of color.
But in the pictures of sunlighted
Venice and Mexico Mr. Noyes feels
and makes us feel the superb, soft
transparency of air and clear, mel
low light. In them are Mexican
costumes abounding in color, high
prowed Venetian boats of purest
blue resting in the cool shadow,
with warm violet distance beyond,
harmonies of color which leave
nothing to be desired. A little
view in the cactus garden, and
another looking over Lagunita with
its present carpet of green, are
color revelations of our own sur
soundings.
This is, indeed, a chance rare to
Stanford people to see the best in
the modern school of painting.
Beginning Friday the room will be
open to the public for a week, 10 to
12 in the morning and 2 to 5
o'clock in the afternoon.
