# Yell Chosen.
## 
### 
The committee on" yells reached
a decision this afternoon. A yell
submitted without the author's
name was selected as the best
among a dozen or more entered for
the contest.
The slogan is:
Tear 'em up, Tear 'em up
Any way to get 'em up,
Stanford 1 Stanford!
Hit that line, Hit that line, Hit
that line
Hard! ! !
