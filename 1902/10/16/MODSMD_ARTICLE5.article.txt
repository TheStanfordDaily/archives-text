# FRESHMAN PRACTICE.
## Naught-Six Makes Good Showing Against Second Football Team. 
### 
The Freshmen lined up against
the Second team last night for fif
teen minutes of hard practice. All
interest centered on the men who
will represent Stanford against
Berkeley on the 18th. For the first
few minutes the "babies" were given
the ball and did well, making their
distance more than once and fight
ing hard against their heavier op
ponents. But on the defence the
Freshmen were weak. The Second
eleven carried the ball to a touch
down from their own thirty-yard
line, rarely using last down to make
their distance. Perhaps the fact
that Sprott, the strongest man in
the line, was layed up with a sore
hand, was accountable for part of the
'06 weakness. The coaches were
determined not to work the Fresh-

men too hard. And hence after
the Second team had scored, the
'06 men were dismissed and a Var
sity line-up followed. The men
took the following positions:
