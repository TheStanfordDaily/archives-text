# NO JOHNSTON OR NO GAME.
## Athletic Committee Decides That Berkeley as Well as Stanford Must Abide by Agreement. 
### 
A question which has been thor
oughly discussed among the foot
ball men was brought to a head
this afternoon by the Athletic Com
mittee, and a decided stand taken
in the matter. The University of
California has been playing at
right half a man named Johnston,
who last year was a member of the
Colorado School of Mines eleven.
His name when presented to
Colonel Edwards, chairman of the
Berkeley faculty athletic commit
tee, was not stricken off. Accord
ing to the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Dr. Angell can throw out
men from the Berkeley list on
questions of amateur standing
only, but he called Colonel Ed
ward's attention to the fact that
Johnston had not been debarred
when he was clearly ineligible.
California's only excuse for play
ing Johnston was that although he
played on the School of Mines
team he was not regularly entered,
but took "pre])" work only. This,
however, in no way makes him eli
gible, as the one-year rule excludes
every man who has played on the
team of an institution of equal
standing with California and
Stanford. Up to the present time
Dr. Angell has received no answer
from Colonel Edwards, and John
ston has continued playing in the
preliminary games.
The Athletic Committee today
declared that in the event of Cali
fornia insisting on using Johnston,
Stanford will not enter the game.
It decided to inform Colonel Ed
wards, Ezra Decoto, the California
manager, and Middleton, the fresh
man captain, of the fact, and also
Dr." Angell, Harry Edwards, and
Magee at Stanford.
The delay in taking up the mat
ter has been largely due to the fact
that it was expected that Colonel
Edwards would take action regard
ing it. Stanford has abided by.
the letter of the agreement. When
ever there was the least doubt, Dr.
Angell struck the name from the
list. Johnston is eligible to neither
freshman or varsity team until he
has been a regularly enrolled stu
dent at Berkeley for one year.
The evidence which has been
brought against Johnston is,in brief:
That he graduated from the East
Denver high school, which is gen
erally recommended to institutions
of standing, and entered the School
of Mines with the class of 1905,
playing on both class and varsity
football and track teams, and was
there a member of a fraternity
which initiates only university
students of standing.
