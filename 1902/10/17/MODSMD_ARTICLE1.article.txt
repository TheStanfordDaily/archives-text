# JUNIOR HATS DEDICATED.
## Immense Crowd Witnesses the Ceremonies of the 1904 Plug Ugly. 
### 
In the presence cf fully eighteen
hundred people the Junior Plug
Ugly took place on the football
oval last night, and was carried on
with conspicuous success. The
bleachers were taxed to their full
est capacity. The crowd was in
its place long before the time an
nounced for the play, and the
Seniors and the two lower classes
afforded interest to the spectators
with their class yells. The appear
ance of the two hundred Juniors
arrayed in fantastic garbs of all
descriptions was heralded by the
University Band sharply at seven
fifty o'clock. The Juniors took
their places at the east side of the
oval, while the Hand continued its
way around the track, playing as
they inarched. Their appearance
in front of the bleachers met with
an ovation. The use of the Band
was a novelty this year.
The dialogue of the 1904 Farce
was an improvement over former
years in that it was considerably
shortened, and the interest in the
piece was heightened by the con
tinuous change of action. The
illuminating effects were produced
by gasoline and red and green fire.
The action commenced with the
arrival on the field of Badlingo,
King of the Realm, followed by his
train. Waldemar Young carried
this part admirably, and was as
sisted by Palimpso, the Grand
Vizier, in the person of Cleveland
Baker. The mystery of the farce
commences when Perentia, the
beautiful Fairy Queen, appearsand
announces that she has an emblem
that can cure all the ills of the
king's people. The secret is di
vulged by the sign in the sky ar
ranged in the form "P. 0. P.," but
these letters good-naturedly failed
to work, affording considerable
amusement to the spectators. Hun
waddy, the Great Prophet, acted
by L. P. Bansbach, who is to com
plete the restoration of the people,
conies in his chariot, which proved
to be an old broken-down wagon,
and performs the miracles of cur
ing blindness, lameness, and other
ills by the simple process of rub
bing the afilicted members with the
mysterious Junior plug. The play
ends with divulging of the mean
ing of the letters "P. O. P.," which
are interpreted to mean "Put on
Plugs." The entire class put on
their plugs and moved off the field
singing an air to the tune, "A Hot
Time."
The part of the Fairy Queen was
excellently carried by Norman
Collyer, attired as a ballet dancer
in a brilliant costume of red. The
minor parts were in good hands.
After the close of the play the
Seniors rushed from the bleachers
and tried to smash the newly dedi
cated emblems. The long line of
Juniors wound its way about the
campus into the quadrangle, fol
lowed by the Seniors and the two
under classes. The combats be
tween the upper-class men con
tinued for about an hour, after
which the Juniors proceeded to the
gymnasium and dispersed.
