On this eve of the Freshman in
tercollegiate struggle of a year ago
there appeared in this column these
words: "Now that the season of
preparation is over, the Daily
Palo Alto feels that it is time to
tell the Freshmen a secret it has
been struggling to keep for weeks.
It is this: Every man and woman
in the University believes and has
believed all along that the 1905
eleven is going to smash Berkeley
to smithereens tomorrow . . .
We now have an eleven which in
ability, and in the spirit that

counts as much us ability, is second
to none in Stanford history." The
prediction was made and fulfilled
in the face of much dismal fore
boding on the part of those who
had seen the scales tip in Califor
nia's favor in the preliminary
games and were for the moment
forgetful of a sentiment which pre
vails about the quadrangle and
which Professor Lewers aptly ex
pressed at the first football rally
when he said: "A Stanford
man always rejoices when he
is up against it because he
knows he can pull out."
Eleven more determined fighters
and better football players than
those of 190G have never repre
sented the Cardinal. California
has bigger men, more experienced
men, she had four score to choose
from where we had less than two.
Coaching has been lavished on the
team as never before at Berkeley,
while Stanford has been doubly
handicapped in this regard. Yet
from the very odds against us has
evolved a team which can and will
sweep California off its feet.
Freshmen, tomorrow will de
cide who is to carry away the
palm in the first of the year's con
tests against our rival. Opposed
to you will be eleven capable men,
with a bewildering array of cheer
ing adherents. With you will he
the knowledge that three successive
classes before you have struggled
to victory, and that all the Uni
versity asks is that you do your
best to perpetuate the record.
