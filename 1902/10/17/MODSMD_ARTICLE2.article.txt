Of the eight intercollegiate Fresh
man games Stanford has won five
and lost three. The game tomor
row will decide whether Stanford
will have a record of three or four
consecutive victories.
The position of the '06 team is a
difficult one. But its chances of
victory are by no means as slender
as has been generally believed.
"Dad" Moulton reports the team as
being in good general physical con
tition, with no man on the eleven
who is suffering from a severe
sprain or bruise. Sprott, the crack
tackle, has been laid up with a
sprained thumb ever since the
Santa Clara game, but this will
prove no serious inconvenience to
him tomorrow.
As far as coaching is concerned,
only the best can be said. That
the Freshmen know how to play
the game there can be no doubt.
The only question is whether or
not they will play the game they
know. Individually the men show
up well. The backtield is fast and
strong. Captain Magee at left-half
will prove invaluable in punting
and a tower of strength *in carry
ing the ball. Shine at full-back
has had but little experience at
Stanford, behind the line, and con
sequently is weak in team-work
and slow in taking his place in
formations, but with the ball he is
a strong, heady player. Bounds
or Morrissey are closely matched
for the other half, and each will in
all probability play in the game.
Bounds labors under the disad
vantage of having been out of the
game for two weeks with a cracked
rib. At quarter, Cutler seems to be
the best of what is the weakest
material in the team. His general
ship, however, is good,and he holds
the team together well. At center,
Bryan is strong on defense but
poor in passing the ball. Chenery
will play one guard, and either
Estes or Paine the other. Their
work on defense is good, and on the
offensive they rarely fail to open a
hole for the backs. Cheadle and
Sprott will play the tackles. Of
the two, Sprott is decidedly the
stronger, playing a heady game
and a hard game. At ends the
team is strong. Schofield is a trifle
faster in getting down on punts,but
Preston is sure in tackling and
plays a nervy game on defense.
By a comparison of scores Berke
ley would seem to have the Fresh
men at her mercy, yet the coaches
will not admit this to be true.
Head Coach Clemens recently de
clared that he considered that the
Freshmen had a good chance of
victory should they play the fighting

game which they have been taught.
He thinks that the struggle will be
fierce, and said that to win the
Freshmen must play their hardest,
but he thinks their chances are not
so dark as is generally thought.
Slaker was decidedly reticent when
approached on the outlook. He
said: "The boys know how to play.
It is up to them. If they show the
proper fighting spirit they will win
out. It will be a hard, close fight."
Professor Lewers, who has been
devoting a great deal of his time to
the "babies," regarded their posi
tion as fairly good. He thought
that if they show the same fighting
spirit that they have evidenced
against the Varsity in the past,
they will return with a hard-won
victory; but should they fail to get
into the game for every ounce there
is in them, their chances are poor.
Comparative scores point to a Cali
fornia victory, consensus of opinion
concedes U. C. an easy victory, but
the men at Stanford who know
football recognize that the Fresh
men are not to be sneered at if they
will only play the game hard.
Magee, elected captain by a unan
imous vote, comes to Stanford with
an enviable record. During the
three years he played at full-back
on Santa Clara College his punting
and line-bucking were exception
ally strong. Magee will play at
left half tomorrow.
Shine, at full-back, had little ex
perience before entering the Univer
sity. He figured prominently on
the town team of Redwood City,
playing half-back for several years.
Bounds comes to Stanford from
Santa Clara College, where he
played a hard game behind the
line for three years.
Cuter, the youngest man on the
eleven, registers from Irvington,
where he attended Anderson's
Academy. His football knowled-ge
is drawn from a three years' expe
rience as sub-quarter on the Cen
terville High School.
Preston, who will play at right
end, prepared at Belmont, where he
played two years. He registers
from Woodside, and is a member of
Delta Kappa Epsilon.
Cheadle, right tackle, came to
Stanford from the Ottumwa High
School with a reputation which
had preceded him. For four years
he played a strong game on the
high school eleven.
Estes, right guard, is the heaviest
man on the team. His football
experience is drawn from two years
with Ukiah High School and one
with San Jose Normal.
Bryan, center, registers from
Washington, D. C., where he played
in the line of the Central High
School eleven.
Chenery registers from Port An
geles, Washington, but prepared at
Belmont School, where he played
at guard for two years. He is a
member of Sigma Nil.
Sprott, who will play left tackle,
