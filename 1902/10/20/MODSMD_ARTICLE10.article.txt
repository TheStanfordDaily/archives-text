Much as we all desired a victory
in the game of Saturday, there can
be no bitterness in the attitude of
the Cardinal toward the outcome
of the struggle. Defeat in which
the beaten side goes down fighting
valiantly against a worthy rival
brings with it no cause for recrimi
nation. By dint of good football
California won the game. For
three successive years Blue andGold
freshmen have learned through
bitter experience how hard a task
it is to down a Stanford team.
Hence the unparalleled rejoicing
that has followed this victory over
at Berkeley. Nineteen-Hundred
and-Six fought like Stanford men
to the end, and yielded only to
superior skill and strength. It is
no disgrace to have done one's all
and suffered defeat; it is a lasting
honor to have carried the Cardinal
in even a losing fight. The Fresh
men have done their best —all the
University asked. In behalf of the
University, we thank them for it.
