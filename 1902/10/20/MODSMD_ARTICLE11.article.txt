Last Friday the following from
Colonel Edwards appeared in the
Californian: "I have never seen the
outlook better than it is now for
contest winning. We are to have
eight contests this year, i. e., this
academic year, and as I look at it
there is a possibility that our boys
may make it 'eight straight.' Last
year it was six out of eight that
were won, and the outlook was not
so good as it is this year."
Within the last month we have
heard Colonel Edwards say several
things. He said that Albertson could
not register, and he said that John
ston could play. Now he maintains
that somewhere in the skies he has
seen a pillar of smoke that seemed
to prophesy one long unbroken line
of California victory. Little can be
said in reply to the Berkeley seer's

prediction other than California
has not won any of the eight, ex
cept last Saturday's game, and that
victories are never secure until the
last string in broken, and the last
whistle blown. Colonel Edwards'
optimism, we have reason to be
lieve, is entirely unwarranted by
existing conditions. In the mean
time there is a world of work to be
done. Every man who hopes to
represent Stanford must toil; every
manager, every captain, every
rooter must put his shoulder to the
wheel; every organization and every
individual must encourage the ath
lete, the debater, the chess player
—must remove obstacles from the
path. Seven contests are before us,
and the prospects are bright,
brighter than they have been in
years, Colonel Edwards notwith
standing.
