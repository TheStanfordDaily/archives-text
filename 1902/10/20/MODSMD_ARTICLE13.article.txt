# Girls Organize Gym Club.
## 
### 
The first meeting of girls inter
ested in the formation of a Roble
Gym Club was held last week. The
full membership of the club will
not be more than fifteen, since un
usual ability and interest in ath
letics are admission requirements.
Dark suits, with appropriate trim
mings in red, will be worn. At a
second meeting to be held this week
officers will be elected and plans
for the semester's work determined
upon.
