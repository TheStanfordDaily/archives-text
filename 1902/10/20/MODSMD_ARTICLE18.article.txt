# "THE CHIEF THING."
## Professor Alden's Sunday Sermon in the University Chapel Yesterday Morning. 
### 
Professor It. M. Alden of the
English department spoke in the
chapel yesterday morning on the
subject ''The Chief Thing," taking
as his text passages from the sixth
chapter of Matthew. Part of his
address follows:
"There are relative degrees of im
portance in the duties of life; we
do not choose between good and
bad, but between good and better.
It is sometimes hard to tell what
has the right of way. When we
speak of a man making a failure of
life, it is not that he has chosen to
do bad things, but that he gave the
less important things the chief
place —life, for him, has dribbled
away. In the Sermon on the Mount
Christ tells us that law lays stress
on the external, while the gospel
concerns itself with the inner life.
Jesus says you must choose be
tween the external and the internal.
While it is necessary to consider
food and raiment, they should not
dominate the horizon. Life is
more than meat, although hard
facts seem against it.
"I question whether this age is
material; whether materialism has
not rather been weakened by the
last century of thought. There is
a moment when the good within
can dominate man. It is not true
that man must live —the relative
importance of things is brought
out in a time of stress, and some
times man must die for truth. The
story of Esau has become an ex
ample for those who would barter
a permanent good for a temporary
want. With Esau the mess of
pottage loomed up in the wrong
perspective. Work may be routine
if it is simply a means to gain an
income; but if the work is supremo,
it may look like routine but not
be, because it becomes the end.
Jesus speaks much of the Kingdom
of God and of eternal life, but says
very little about future life. He
does not place the future against
the present. Something must be
first in life. Some students come
to the University for a diploma;
some for a good time; some for
credit; some for athletics; some be
cause they have caught a glimpse
of the kingdom of truth. Athletics,
credits, diploma, etc., are not to be
disregarded, but made tributary to
the chief end.

"Jesus said this kingdom is not
visible: it is within, invisible, ideal.
The dominant power which en
ters into Hie life of man is service
in human relations.
"The first question we ask about
a football game is not who won,
but was it fairly won? Regarding
a strike we ask whether the solu
tion furthered the cause of right;
in a great national dispute, whether
our birthright has been preserved.
Personal rights and service for
others have become dominant
factors in life; we hope much from
the future, but the outcome is yet
indistinct; there is still much to
attain. Like everything worth
while, the pursuit after the king
dom of heaven is never seen fin
ished. Browning speaks of the
broken arch suggesting the perfect
round. Tennyson points us to a
gleam in the sky which is not of
the sun, nor the moon, nor the
stars. 'Follow the gleam' and the
kingdom of heaven will surely be
found."
