### 
The services in chapel last night
were led by L. E. Harter, whose
subject was "Studies in Stanford
Life." He took his theme from a
sentence in Dr. Jordan's address
to the Class of '02, which defines
"College; a place where young men
and women go away from home to
get an education." The notion
prevalent that college life is a de
tour from the usual course of exist
ence, he attributed to the fact that
during those four years old ties of
friendship are cut and new ones
formed. The ability to form last
ing and worthy personal relations,
he held *o be dependent upon spir
itual development.
