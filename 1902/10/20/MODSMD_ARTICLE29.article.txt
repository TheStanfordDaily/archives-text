# The
						Jordan Calendar.
## 
### 
President Jordan has such a
habit of saying sententious things
that it is a great wonder his
wise and witty remarks have not
been calendared long ago. Now
the inspiration has come. The
Y. W. C. A. has done it. Their
Jordan calendar is almost com
pleted, and will be put on sale in
good time for the holiday trade.
On the title-page appears a por
trait of the President. Within are
twelve sheets, each containing be
sides the calendar for the month a
posterish design of some character
istic bit of University life or envi
ronment. August shows the road,
bank, and poplars near French
man's Lake. November has a foot
ball scrimmage; June, a vista of
arches and tiled roofs, with swal
lows darting across the page. One
fine sketch shows the columned sol
itude of a redwood forest, â€”that is
July, mid-vacation.
Each page contains an extract
from some of Dr. Jordan's pub
lished books, and the lettering for
these quotations as well as the cal
endar numerals are designed as a
part of the page.
A limited number of the calen
dars are being colored by hand
by a corps of helpers of Miss
Ethel Traphagen, the chief de
signer. Dr. Jordan has consented
to sign these on the title-page with
his autograph, and they are to be
sold at a higher price than the un
colored copies, and only by sub
scription.
