# Fossil for Geology Department.

Mr. Ed. Erhorn, a former gradu
ate student at Stanford, has made
a valuable addition to the Geology
department's collection of fossils in
the shape of a mastodon's tooth.
The specimen was unearthed while
workmen were digging a well near
Sunnyvale, and was found among
fragmentary bones which cannot
be certainly classified, although
they are thought to be from a mas
todon's skeleton. The tooth, which
is a heavy molar, iB about Bix
inches long and three inches in
diameter, and is well preserved. It
is of some scientific value by virtue
of its being the first trace of masto
don remains in the Santa Clara
valley. Teeth and even tusks of
mammoths have been found fre
quently, but the recent specimen is
undoubtedly from a mastodon.
Mr. Ehrhorn is at present the
county entomologist.
