# GAME WAS CALIFORNIA'S
## Stanford Freshmen Defeated in Ninth Intercollegiate Match After a Plucky, Up-hill Battle, by a Score of 12-0. 
### 
Defeat without dishonor was the
result of Saturday's game for Stan
ford. Contrary to the hopes of
every wearer of the cardinal, the
class of 1906 at California out
played the Stanford "babies" in
nearly every feature of the game
and won by a score of 12 to 0.
Their victory was decisive and well
earned, as they excelled their rivals
in every way. Their team-work
was wonderfully developed, their
defense impregnable, their offense
not to be checked.
It was clear from the first run,
behind a close formation, when
Muther carried the ball fifteen
yards around right end, until time
was called at the end of the second
half, that it was California's day.
Yet the Freshmen have no reason
to be ashamed of the game they
played. Outweighed by a team
which had been coached to a state
bordering on perfection, they played
a defensive game which gained in
strength and efficacy with every
minute. From Captain Magee,
who was in every play, fighting
for every inch, and Sprott, whose
good tackling helped materially to
keep down the score, to the last
substitute, every man struggled
bravely and well. The first touch
down, where good playing and good
fortune gave Berkeley a score of
six points within five minutes of
play, dazed the Stanford eleven as
completely as it crazed the crowded
Berkeley bleachers with a joy felt
for the first time in four years.
Berkeley scored again before Stan
ford regained her equilibrium and
settled down to the dogged defense
that resisted all attempts of Cali
fornia to cross the goal line again.
The straggling Stanford rooters,
who through some lack of fore
thought had been provided with no
section, were unable to support
their team with the volume of
sound which rolled forth from the
closely packed Berkeley section.
Yet the spirit of "never say die,"
the Stanford spirit, was in the air,
and so thrilled the disappointed
players that in the second half
they held their opponents for no
score, and with the ball always
dangerously close to their goal line,
fought with plucky determination
to the end.
Shortly after three o'clock the
Stanford eleven spread out to re
ceive the California kick-off. Sprott
captured Lindley's thirty-five-yard
punt and was downed almost in
his tracks. Magee then carried
the ball a yard around right end
and made first down on a mass
through tackle. Morrissey was
called on for four yards, and Shine
waß pushed through center for
another, setting the Stanford
bleachers wild as the eleven made
its distance again. • Almost at
once Magee was forced to kick as
the result of an attempted end run
by Morrissey,who was thrown back
for three yards. Berkeley got the
ball on her forty-five-yard line,and

in three plays carried it to a touch
down. Muther circled the end for
fifteen yards, Middleton fumbled,
and the ball rolled fifteen yards
toward the Stanford goal, only to
be recovered by California; and
then, behind an interference which
formed an impenetrable armor,
Bosbyshell sped around right end
for a thirty-five-yard run and a
touchdown. As Lindley sent the
pigskin squarely between the posts
the Stanford yell rang out defiantly
in reply to the triumphant shout
of California.
The second touchdown was made
by an almost uninterrupted series
cf line plunges and end runs to
which Magee and Sprott formed
the only opposition worthy of the
Gillis received Magee's punt and
ran it in well, after which Stern
bored through center for a five-yard
gain. Stanford held for a down,
and Berkeley resorted to a fake
kick, which netted five yards
through the line. The Freshmen
became demoralized, and although
the California backs were slow in
starting and suffered from the poor
passing of the quarter, the team
was simply carried off its feet by
the heavier weight and wonderful
team-work of the California players.
Mass plays on tackle and guard,
interspersed with end runs by
Muther and Bosbyshell, placed
Berkeley within striking distance
of the Stanford goal. Stanford
rallied on the fifteen-yard line and
for a moment promised to hold,
but Stern tore a hole through cen
ter, which gave California her first
down, and Middleton was carried
around left end for the second and
last touchdown. The goal was
difficult but Lindley again earned
a point by booting the leather
fairly across the bar.
With twelve points to Stanford's
none and ten minutes left to play
it looked black for Stanford in an
attempt to keep down the score,
but the brace came and for the rest
of the contest the team put up a
nervy and effective defense.
Magee kicked off again and
Bosbyshell returned the ball
twenty-five yards through the scat
tered Stanford eleven. Four differ
ent men figured in his interference
and four Stanford tackles were
blocked by California's careful
work. It looked like another
touchdown for the Blue and Gold
as the ball was carried down the
field five and ten yards at a time,
but Stern fumbled within the shad
ow of the goal-posts and Magee
kicked out of danger. Before Cali
fornia could get well started the
first half ended with the ball in
Berkeley's possession twenty-five
yards from the Stanford goal.
When the two elevens took the
gridiron for the second half it was
only to wage a battle drawn as to
score, although the ball was kept
between the center of the field and
the Stanford ten-yard line. Time
after time by heavy line-bucking
and long end-runs the ball would
be placed close to the • Stanford
goal, only to have the wearied line
gather itself together for one more
desperate effort and take it away
from Berkeley on downs. Magee
was forced to punt every time the
Cardinal secured the ball, as the
backs, unsupported in their efforts,
were unable to gain against
the aggressive opposing line.
Of the thirteen kicks that
Magee made, only one was
blocked; one of the Stanford backs
interfered with the ball on that oc
casion, and it fell into Berkeley
hands on the twenty-five-yard line.
Bosbyshell and Stern advanced the
oval by short rushes to the fifteen
yard line, and there California lost
it on downs.
Ma gee's punt of forty yards was
returned by California, and Bosby
shell secured the ball when Magee
again sent it down the field. He
fumbled five yards from the line,
and Cheadle fell on the ball half a
foot from the goal. The ball was
carried out five yards, and Magee
kicked out of danger. It was too
late for hope of another score, and
after a magnificent end-run by
Bosbyshell the game ended with
the ball on the Stanford thirty
yard line in the possession of Cali
fornia.
The defeat was due to one fact
alone: the Cardinal team was out
classed. Its line was slow and con
stantly on the defense, its ends
were unable to break the interfer
ence of the Blue and Gold, and of
the backs Magee alone offered ma
terial aid in filling the holes in the
Stanford line. It was in lack of
team-work, however, that the great

est weakness of the Freshmen lay.
Although the ball was seldom in
thier possession, they were unable
to show a united front to the quick
rushes of the opposing forwards,
who invariably tackled the runner
before he was well started.
The team-work of California waß
exceptionally good,—so good that
it would be unjust to attribute
great praise to the Berkeley backß
for their long end-runs. The
tackles played hard, and Gillis.the
quarter, handled the team like a
veteran; while of the hacks, Bosby
shell at least gave promise of de
veloping into Varsity material.
The work of the officials was uni
formly excellent, Hall not hesitat
ing a minute in ruling off McDon
ough, the California!!, for slugging
Magee. Aside from this, the con
test was remarkably free from un
sportsmanlike acts, there being but
little holding and almost no slug
ging-
