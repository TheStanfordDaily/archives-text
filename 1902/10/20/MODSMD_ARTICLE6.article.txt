# Lower-Classmen Will Not Dance.
## 
### 
It has been definitely announced
that the Freshman Glee and the
Sophomore Cotillion will not be
given this year. When the decision
was reached that the annual
dances of the two under-classea
could not take place in Encina
Hall it was thought that the gym
nasium could be secured. This
latest announcement, however, puts
an end to any intentions in that
direction. There will be but two
college dances this year: The Junior
Prom and the Senior Ball, which
will take place as usual in Encina.
