Although wishing to commend
he efforts of the cheer leaders to
get suitable and spirited yells, we
question the advisability of adopt
ing the slogans of other universities.
Indeed, the courtesy of such a
move seems to be the most im
portant thing to consider. The
"L. S. J. U." yell, which the
bleachers have been practicing the
last few days, is a very close copy
of the Michigan cheer. By openly
"lifting" their battle-cry we lay
the University open to criticism of
a petty nature. VVe need good,
snappy yellsâ€”but above all we want
original ones. The aim of our
leaders should be to adopt such as
can under no circumstances be
branded as plagiarisms.
