In a long and ingenious editorial
the Daily Califomian of yesterday

morning impugns the motives of
the Stanford Athletic Committee
in taking a summary stand
against the playing of Johnston in
the Freshman game Saturday. The
editorial writer has cleverly organ
ized his statements and misstate
ments, and has gained over his
hysterical predecessors of last year
in the dignity with which he makes
them. Just now it is sufficient in
these columns to say that our Ath
letic Committee took its stand after
vainly waiting for two weeks for a
reply from California to a commu
nication from Dr. Angell explain
ing that Johnston was considered
ineligible here. The committee
acted after careful consideration.
It had the support of the student
body in its position. Since, how
ever, the Californian has chosen to
question the integrity of the Ath
letic Committee instead of discuss
ing the merits of the controversy,
we deem it advisable before pro
ceeding to an analysis of the article
to await the preparation of the
committee's own statement, which
will doubtless be forthcoming at
the meeting tonight.
