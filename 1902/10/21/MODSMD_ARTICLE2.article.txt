# Progress on Gridiron.
## 
### 
Last night saw a much dimin
ished squad out for practice. Of
the Freshmen who have figured so
prominently during the last few
days only a few appeared on the
Held for a try at the Varsity. The
coaches were decidedly exercised
over this action on the part of the
Freshmen,as they hoped enough men
would remain out to furnish hard
competition for the second eleven.
So far this season the Varsity has
suffered somewhat from a lack of
strong opposing material. It was
hoped that with enough men on
the gridiron to form three elevens
the difficulty might be removed by
a struggle for the places.
Light signal practice was the
order for nearly an hour before the
Varsity lined up against the second
team for twenty minutes of hard
scrimmage. Neither team was
successful in overcoming the other's
strong defense,and the ball was lost
on downs first by one side and
then by the other. Dole was tried
at center, as Lee was in the city
and Hauverman is laid up with a
cold. Although the services of the
latter may not be lost permanently,
the fact that he will be out of the
game for some time is by no means
encouraging at this late date. The
other Varsity men who have been
invalided with more or less severe
injuries are rapidly rounding into
shape. Dole, McGilvray, and Mc-
Fadden have all shown up for hard
practice again and liansbach's
ankles are strong enough to en
able him to be back in the game.
