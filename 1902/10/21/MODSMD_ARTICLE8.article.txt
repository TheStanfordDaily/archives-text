The business office of the Uni
versity in the Outer Quad is fast
nearing completion, and Business
Manager Lathrop and his assist
ants will be fully settled therein by
November Ist. The interior wood
work is almost finished. The floor
in the main room is of hard wood,
while small squares of white and
green tile are to constitute the lob

paint will go on the walls. When
this building is completed the Uni
versity will have no regular office
in San Francisco.
