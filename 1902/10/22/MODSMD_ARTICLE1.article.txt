# FACULTY AND STUDENTS ACT.
## Three Committees at Joint Meeting Decide to Protest Two California Candidates. 
### 
Last night the Athletic Commit
tees of the Faculty and the Associ
ated Students and the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents in joint meeting considered
the names of the candidates for the
California varsity as submitted to
Dr. Angell by the Berkeley faculty
committee. Some action was
deemed necessary, as Colonel Ed
wards had included in the list the
name of W. E. Johnston, the Colo
rada School of Mines player whom
California withdrew on the eve of
the Freshman game, at Stanford's
protest.
The questions growing out of the
obscure phrasing of the Intercolle
giate Agreement were thoroughly
discussed and the attitude of the
faculty and students made clear.
It was the feeling of those present
that the agreement was entered
into in the interest of cleaner ath
letics, and as such should be lived
up to.
The eligibility of Warren Smith,
California's half-back, will also be
questioned. A committeo consist
ing of J. C. McCaughern, '03, F. A.
Brown, '03, and H. S. Lee, '03, was
appointed to get the evidence
against these men in shape and
turn it over to Treasurer Edwards,
to be sent by him to Colonel Ed
wards of the California faculty
athletic committee before Saturday
of this week. Then in case Colonel
Edwards refuses to debar Johnston
and Smith, Stanford will demand
that the matter be referred to the
Arbitration Committee, to be pro
vided for by the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford and California,
whose decision shall be final.
The evidence against Johnston
in this case will be the same as that
which called forth the ultimatum
"No Johnston or no game," before
the Freshman match. Affidavits
will be gotten immediately from
those students at Stanford who last
year attended the Golden School,
and of whose classes Johnston was
a member.
The fight against Smith will be
made on the wording of the Inter
collegiate Agreement, regardless of
the action of the Pacific Athletic
Association in re-instating him to
amateur standing. The clause of
the Agreement reads as follows:
An amateur is defined as being "one
. . . who lias not instructed,
pursued, or assisted in the pursuit
of athletic exercises as a means of
livelihood, or for gain or any emol
ument."
In case California refuses to
throw out the men and at the same
time refuses to submit the contro
versy to the Arbitration Committee,
all athletics for the year will be
called off.
