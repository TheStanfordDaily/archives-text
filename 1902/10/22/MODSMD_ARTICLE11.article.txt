# Committee Will Report on Deficit.
## 
### 
The Senior class will convene to
morrow to listen to the committee
lhat last week was appointed to
investigate the report of Chester
Naramore, manager of last year's
Quad, who asked the class to pay
$190.51 deficit. The committee
has gone over Naramore's books
carefully and will make a detailed
report of their findings. From the
amount of discussion and interest
taken in the matter a large meeting
is expected.
