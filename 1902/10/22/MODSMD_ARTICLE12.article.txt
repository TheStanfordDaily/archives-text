# Last Night's Musical.

### 
The musical given by pupils of
Mrs. Dam-Hilton packed the
chapel last evening. Of the solo
ists, E. H. McCandlish easily car
ried off the honors, although his
enunciation was not all that could
have been desired. George L.
Kronmiller, in his solo "Song of
the Sword," lost a splendid chance
for effective work through lack of
enthusiasm. The two selections by
the Amphion Quartette were fairly
successful, although the parts were
not well balanced. The choice of
Miss Hostetter as accompanist
was particularly fortunate as her
work contributed much to the
effectiveness of the selections. On
the whole the concert was fairly
successful, meeting with the ap
proval of the audience, but some
regret was expressed that Mrs.
Dam-llilton herself did not sing
one or two numbers.
