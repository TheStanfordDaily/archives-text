The whole discussion really is
based on the interpretation of the
latest amendments to the Athletic
Agreement, into which Stanford
cunningly enough reads a meaning
suitable to her own ends.
The foregoing quotation is the
key-sentence from a lengthy edi
torial in which the Daily Califor
nian scores Stanford for taking ihe
stand it did on the Johnston mat
ter, and the Berkeley authorities
for yielding to the Stanford ulti
matum, "No Johnston or no game."
The editorial is too long to repro
duce in full. Suffice it to say that
it makes the following points: that
Stanford's act in refusing to enter
a game in which Johnston partici
pated is not sanctioned by the In
tercollegiate Agreement; that the
only proper authority to pass on
Johnston's eligibility was Colonel
Edwards, who had declared him
eligible after careful investigation;
that Stanford, instead of refusing
to enter the game should have sub
mitted the matter to arbitration
along lines laid down by the
Agreement; that Johnston, al
though admittedly a student at the
Colorado School of Mines for a
time, was there merely to prepare
for California, and gained no ad
vanced credit at Berkeley for work
done at Golden; that it was not
proved "to Colonel Edwards' satis
faction" that Johnston was a "reg
ular member of an eleven in the
Colorado School"; that the eligibil
ity of Captain Magee of Stanford
was open to the same question as
that of the Colorado player, because
Santa Clara College and the
Colorado School of Mines are en
rolled in the same category in a
provisional list of schools submit
ted to California by Stanford; that
the eligibility of Magee was ques
tioned, "but California decently ac

cepted Dr. Angell's reply" that he
was eligible; and finally that "Cal
ifornia has not admitted, nor will
she admit, that Johnston is ineli
gible until further and authentic
contrary proof is produced."
The faculty and student com
mittees have well decided that the
cases of Johnston and Warren
Smith shall be carried if need be
to a board of arbitration. In the
light of their action a very brief
statement will be sufficient to ex
plain a few points concerning
which the Califomian writer leaves
an erroneous impression.
Two weeks before the match Dr.
Angell informed Colonel Edwards
that in his Opinion Johnston was
ineligible to participate in athletics
at California this year because he
had represented the Colorado
School of Mines in football last
year. To this Colonel Edwards
vouchsafed not so much as the
courtesy of a reply. Neither vol
untaiily nor in response to queries
from Stanford did California's rep
resentatives give any intimation of
whether Johnston was to be played
or not until the eve of the game.
When it was finally learned that
Colonl Edwards still considered the
player eligible, it was too late for
the arbitration on the necessity
of which California lays such
stress. There was no alternative
but an ultimatum—for which the
dilatory tactics adopted by
Colonel Edwards is alone respon
sible. As to Johnston's standing
at Golden, it is only sufficient to
say that the gentleman was duly
registered, and according to his
own statement and affidavits of
his acquaintances, played on the
varsity football team at Golden
last year. These facts the Calif or
nian and Colonel Edwards have
doubtless long since learned, and
that they still clamor for "proofs"
is no credit to their fairness or
their perspicacity.
It is perfectly true that the Reg
istrar of this University classed
Santa Clara College and the Colo
rado School of Mines as not being
institutions from which students
may enter Stanford and not count
on loss of standing, it is also true
that neither here nor at the Univer
sity of California are Santa Clara
and (he Colorado School of Mines
ranked as equal. Among other
things, Santa Clara has a prepara
tory department, but the School of
Mines has none, except in so far as
the U. C. authorities choose to con
sider it preparatory. Among other
institutions which Stanford in
cludes in the second group
are the University of Arizona,
the University of Southern
California, Hamlin University,
Morningside College, Fairmount
College, and Christian Brothers'
College, from all of which, as well
as from the Colorado School of
Mines, candidates for the Fresh
man team were excluded by
the Stanford committee. More
over, Magee was not objected
to by California because he came
from an institution of standing;
he was objected to on the ground
that he was a student at Stanford
last year. While the Daily Culi
fornian is teaching us lessons in
courtesy to their Faculty Com
mittee, we would humbly suggest
that an official inquiry as to the
placing of a Sophomore on a Fresh
man list by our Faculty Committee
lacks certain elements of delicacy.
Finally, the Stanford list referred
to was prepared as a preliminary
classification for the new one
year residence rule, without any
reference whatever to eligibility to
Freshman teams. According to
our interpretation, as well as ap
plication, of the rule governing
Freshman eligibility, Berkeley has
misinterpreted it — to use a gentle
word—both in spirit and in letter;
in letter by making eligible a man
coming from an institution of
standing, and in spirit by making
e'igible one who had gained his
varsity sweater in such an institu
tion.

The whole discussion really is
based on the interpretation of the
latest amendments to the Athletic
Agreement, into which Stanford
cunningly enough reads a meaning
suitable to her own ends.
The foregoing quotation is the
key-sentence from a lengthy edi
torial in which the Daily Califor
nian scores Stanford for taking ihe
stand it did on the Johnston mat
ter, and the Berkeley authorities
for yielding to the Stanford ulti
matum, "No Johnston or no game."
The editorial is too long to repro
duce in full. Suffice it to say that
it makes the following points: that
Stanford's act in refusing to enter
a game in which Johnston partici
pated is not sanctioned by the In
tercollegiate Agreement; that the
only proper authority to pass on
Johnston's eligibility was Colonel
Edwards, who had declared him
eligible after careful investigation;
that Stanford, instead of refusing
to enter the game should have sub
mitted the matter to arbitration
along lines laid down by the
Agreement; that Johnston, al
though admittedly a student at the
Colorado School of Mines for a
time, was there merely to prepare
for California, and gained no ad
vanced credit at Berkeley for work
done at Golden; that it was not
proved "to Colonel Edwards' satis
faction" that Johnston was a "reg
ular member of an eleven in the
Colorado School"; that the eligibil
ity of Captain Magee of Stanford
was open to the same question as
that of the Colorado player, because
Santa Clara College and the
Colorado School of Mines are en
rolled in the same category in a
provisional list of schools submit
ted to California by Stanford; that
the eligibility of Magee was ques
tioned, "but California decently ac

cepted Dr. Angell's reply" that he
was eligible; and finally that "Cal
ifornia has not admitted, nor will
she admit, that Johnston is ineli
gible until further and authentic
contrary proof is produced."
The faculty and student com
mittees have well decided that the
cases of Johnston and Warren
Smith shall be carried if need be
to a board of arbitration. In the
light of their action a very brief
statement will be sufficient to ex
plain a few points concerning
which the Califomian writer leaves
an erroneous impression.
Two weeks before the match Dr.
Angell informed Colonel Edwards
that in his Opinion Johnston was
ineligible to participate in athletics
at California this year because he
had represented the Colorado
School of Mines in football last
year. To this Colonel Edwards
vouchsafed not so much as the
courtesy of a reply. Neither vol
untaiily nor in response to queries
from Stanford did California's rep
resentatives give any intimation of
whether Johnston was to be played
or not until the eve of the game.
When it was finally learned that
Colonl Edwards still considered the
player eligible, it was too late for
the arbitration on the necessity
of which California lays such
stress. There was no alternative
but an ultimatum—for which the
dilatory tactics adopted by
Colonel Edwards is alone respon
sible. As to Johnston's standing
at Golden, it is only sufficient to
say that the gentleman was duly
registered, and according to his
own statement and affidavits of
his acquaintances, played on the
varsity football team at Golden
last year. These facts the Calif or
nian and Colonel Edwards have
doubtless long since learned, and
that they still clamor for "proofs"
is no credit to their fairness or
their perspicacity.
It is perfectly true that the Reg
istrar of this University classed
Santa Clara College and the Colo
rado School of Mines as not being
institutions from which students
may enter Stanford and not count
on loss of standing, it is also true
that neither here nor at the Univer
sity of California are Santa Clara
and (he Colorado School of Mines
ranked as equal. Among other
things, Santa Clara has a prepara
tory department, but the School of
Mines has none, except in so far as
the U. C. authorities choose to con
sider it preparatory. Among other
institutions which Stanford in
cludes in the second group
are the University of Arizona,
the University of Southern
California, Hamlin University,
Morningside College, Fairmount
College, and Christian Brothers'
College, from all of which, as well
as from the Colorado School of
Mines, candidates for the Fresh
man team were excluded by
the Stanford committee. More
over, Magee was not objected
to by California because he came
from an institution of standing;
he was objected to on the ground
that he was a student at Stanford
last year. While the Daily Culi
fornian is teaching us lessons in
courtesy to their Faculty Com
mittee, we would humbly suggest
that an official inquiry as to the
placing of a Sophomore on a Fresh
man list by our Faculty Committee
lacks certain elements of delicacy.
Finally, the Stanford list referred
to was prepared as a preliminary
classification for the new one
year residence rule, without any
reference whatever to eligibility to
Freshman teams. According to
our interpretation, as well as ap
plication, of the rule governing
Freshman eligibility, Berkeley has
misinterpreted it — to use a gentle
word—both in spirit and in letter;
in letter by making eligible a man
coming from an institution of
standing, and in spirit by making
e'igible one who had gained his
varsity sweater in such an institu
tion.
