# THE 						EVENING'S PRACTICE.
## The 						Work of the Varsity Improves as the Date for the Intercollegiate Draws Near. 
### 
As the time for the intercollegi
ate game draws near practice on
the gridiron becomes a more seri
ous thing than the light tackling
and signal practice of the early
part of the season. Last night, in
a long, hard scrimmage, the coaches
impressed upon the candidates for
the Varsity the fact that in order
to defeat Berkeley there is yet
much work to be done. From now
on work will get harder until the
last few days before the big game,
when light signal practice will be
given the men that they may round
into perfect physical condition.
The Varsity wa√ü able to score twice
against the Second team on end
runs last night, giving evidence of
better interference than has yet
been shown. Butterfield at right
end effectually stopped all the
attempts of the Varsity in his
direction. He played a quick, care
ful game. Clark and Magee were
successful in running the other end,
however, and made big gains be
hind the clever interference of their
team-mates. The Second was un
able to make its distance on line
buck,sand the Varsity had the ball
in its posssssion almost continu
ously.
The tackling of the whole squad
is deplorably weak; the other fea
tures of the game are fairly de
veloped,although in team-work and"
defense there is still room for a
great deal of improvement.
The teams lined up in the follow
ing order:
