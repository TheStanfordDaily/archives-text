### 
The Stanford English Club is
about to enter upon a large under
taking in the form of a presenta
tion of an old English play. The
play chosen is the "Knight of the
Burning Pestle," by Beaumont, a
burlesque satire upon the methods
of the Elizabethan playwright. The
piece is extremely original and is
overflowing with witticisms and
comic situations. It will undoubt
edly prove to be one of the most
entertaining productionsever staged
at Stanford.
The aim of the English
Club will be to reproduce this
Elizabethan comedy in a thorough
and scholarly way sometime in the
early spring. A cast met Friday for
the first rehearsal.
