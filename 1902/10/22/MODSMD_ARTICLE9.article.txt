# "Chappie" Out Again.
## 
### 
The third number of the Chapar
ral, which appeared today, has for
its editorial message an apprecia
tion of the publications sent out by
our neigh hers ncros√ü the bay.
There is, too, something said about
absented office-holding, and other
matters political, that will bear
thoughtful reading. The leading
verse, "The Junior Plug?," is good,
but its appearance now is un
timely.
