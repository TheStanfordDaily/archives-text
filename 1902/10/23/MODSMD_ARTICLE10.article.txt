# SENIORS CONSIDER DEFICIT.
## Report of Committee of Investigation Laid on the Table.â€”Liabilities Exceed Assets. 
### 
This afternoon the Senior clans
met in the chapel to hear the report
of the committee appointed to in
vestigate the Quad deficit. The re
port, while not final, was very full.
It was laid on tho table pending
developments, some of the items of
Business Manager Naramore's
hooks not being elucidated to the
committee's satisfaction. From the
findings of the committee it would
seem that the management of the
annual was somewhat unbusiness
like, which makes the task of inves
tigation a hard one. Naramore's
contracts were not forthcoming ex
cept those with Franklin, the pho
tographer. These did not compel
Franklin to do his work on time,
an oversight that cost the Quad a
very large amount of money.
Franklin demands immediate
payment of his hill which, when
originally presented, amounted to
$367.00. This Naramore cut to
$131.15. The committee allowed
$277.50. The class instructed the
treasurer to pay this amount.
Other liabilities of the class were
found to be as originally reported
to the class by Naramore. The
total assets seem to be $87.94; lia
bilities, $392.26. This makes a
deficit of $304.32. The Senior class
has about $287.00 in its treasury.
The resignation of It. E. Warfield
as vice-president was accepted, and
0. D. Hauverman was elected to
fill the vacancy.
A committee consisting of Miss
Lucia A. Keniston, 11. P. Kuhn,
and C. \V. Thomas, chairman, was
appointed by President Hadley to
draft recommendations concerning
a class pin.
