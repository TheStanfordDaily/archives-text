A matter of considerable im
portance to a large number of the
student body will be brought be
fore the Women's Athletic Associa
tion tomorrow afternoon. It is
something which should receive
the attention of every woman on
the campus, whether athletically
inclined or not. Acros√ü the bay
we see a great amount of interest
in tennis, basket-ball, and other
athletic sports favored by the sex.
Already a tennis challenge has
been received, and other proposi
tions are being agitated, which will
be subjected to full discussion at
tomorrow's conclave.
