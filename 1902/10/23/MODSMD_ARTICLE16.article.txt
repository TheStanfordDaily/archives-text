Manager Edwards reports that
many football suits, issued during
the season to candidates who have
ceased appearing at practice, have
not been turned in at the Training
house. Most of them were used
for a time; a few of them have not
been seen since they were given out
at the beginning of the year. The
suits are student body property
and are loaned to athletes only so
long as they appear on the field.
A mere reminder of the fact should
lead to a speedy return.
