It is the earnest desire of the foot
ball management to get enough
men into the field to form two scrub
elevens. Should the Freshmen, who
have been monopolizing the time of
the coaches for the past two weeks,
remain out to help the Varsity,this
would be a possibility. Unfortu
nately the Freshmen have shown
no such inclination,although but a
day could have justly been allowed
them to recover from the effects of
last Saturday's struggle. The
meagre squad of '06 men to whom
the University need of their ser
vices has appealed with sufficient

force to keep them on the field, are
deserving of the highest praise.
Should the majority, which so fur
has held back fail to answer the ap
peal of the coaches, it becomes sub
ject for the severest censure.
