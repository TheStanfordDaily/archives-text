# Practice in the Rain.
## 
### 
Football practice was interrupted
I>y the heavy rain,which dampened
the enthusiasm of the players last
night and cleared the benches of
all but a solitary spectator. After
signal work a hard scrimmage gave
the men work for a strenuous half
hour. Both the Varsity and
Second team fumbled continually,
tho unfortunate tendency of the
wet ball to slip from the hands at
ciitical moments operating against
a Varsity score in no small measure
The only score of the Varsity came
as the result of an end-run, after
the line of the Second had evi
denced its ability to withstand the
plunges of the backs. The spirit
of the men was good, in spite of
the adverse condition of the weath
er, and the practice was of benefit
in preparation for the Varsity
game, as the team must be pre
pared for wet as well as dry
weather.
The line-up follows:
