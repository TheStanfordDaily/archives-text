# Johnston Case Not Arbitrative.
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The report of the joint meeting
of the Student and Faculty Ath
letic Committees in last night's
Daily Palo Alto seems to me in
some respects misleading, especial
ly as regards the position of the
Faculty Committee, which, in brief,
is as follows:
The amateur standing of W. W.
Smith is, with the consent of
Berkeley, a subject for arbitration.
The case of Johnston, aB it stands,
is not a subject for arbitration.
Berkeley's position in this is based
oil that clause of the Intercollegiate
Agreement which declares that the
decision of faculty athletic commit
tees in making up lists shall be
final. The advice of this Faculty
Committee was and is to go ahead
and play the big game, accepting
Berkeley's list without formal pro
test except as regards amateur
standing. If then at the Intercol
legiate Athletic Meeting in Janu
ary the two universities cannot
come to a better understanding in
regard to the interpretation of the
Agreement than now exists, it will
be for the best interests of both
that all intercollegiate athletic re
lations cease.
I also wish to deprecate the crit
icism of Colonel Edwards which I
find in yesterday's paper: the
chairman of a faculty athletic
committee has enough trouble at
home, without being subject to
long-range public criticism.
