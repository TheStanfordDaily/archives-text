# Improvements at Inn.
## 
### 
The University Inn is now able
to accommodate 200 students and
regular boarders. The finances are
in such good condition that the
management has decided to try
two innovations: A short-order bill
of fare will be served at noon after
November 10th for those desiring a
quick meal; and on rainy days and
special occasions a second table will
be provided twenty-five minutes
after the meal hour for the accom
modation of transients.
