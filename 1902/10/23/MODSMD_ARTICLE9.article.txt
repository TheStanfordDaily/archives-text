# THE 						NOYES EXHIBIT.
## Merits of Pictures on View at Studio Discussed by an Appreciative Critic. 
### 
The following appreciation of the
landscapes of Instructor George
Noyes, now on exhibition at the
studio of the Art department, has
been written for the Daily Palo
Alto by one who is thoroughly
competent to judge of their merits.
To select a few representative
canvases from the Noyes exhibit is
very diflicult, because each is a
fresh impression, showing a unique
phase of nature. Instead of re
casting landscape again and again
in the same scheme of composition,
Mr. Noyes has received nature's
revelation and fixed it in paint
for us.
The three New England hillsides,
for example, are entirely different
but equally characteristic. The
one of white birches shows a clump
of pale trunks, the sunlight almost
full upon them, straggling from
top to bottom of the canvas.
Through the trees are seen rolling,
green hills with crops and build
ings, and blue hills far beyond. To
appreciate the delicacy of the re
sult one must observe the tones
of color which show all this. The
foreground, the tree trunks, the
autumn leaves, and sky are all yel
low, but slightly modified—here
with orange, there vermilion, here
amber, there greenish —until each
thing is in its own place and a
tender harmony pervades it all.
The picture of the hillside farms,
which almost shut out the sky at
the top of the canvas, shows real
autumn in all her brilliance. The
orange and purple madder trees in
the foreground are the acme of
turning leaves. Of the sand dune
canvases, one has a high horizon,
with a purple spur mounting on
the left; behind it rolls the most
exquisite greenish sky of heavy
clouds. As these lift, above the far
distance, a thin light streak of pale
bluish green is disclosed which
widens into lemon-yellow behind a
distant peak. This sky we have
all admired not a few times behind
our own mountains, and here it is,
fixed in paint. Just below this
light streak is a glimpse of clearest
blue distance. Without the broad
expanse of lavender sand which
fills the foreground, exquisite in
itself, the setting would he inade
quate for this climax of blue. An
other large gray stretch of dune
sums up the desolate wildness so
vast, where, as in mountains, na
ture builds for her own delight, not
for human enterprises.
Sunlight in all its glory is shown
where the two Mexicans are wash
ing pots in a swift running stream.
How the sun does revel through
the canvas, bathing all with pris
matic color! The gown of the girl,
for example, is here orange, there
turquoise, with the fleeting hues of
hot steel. Truly the color-wealth
of out-door shadew in strong light
is here in all its richness.
Those who wish to know what
beauties landscape reveals in many
places and times to those whose pro
fession it is to study it, should look
at the canvases in this exhibition
again and again.
