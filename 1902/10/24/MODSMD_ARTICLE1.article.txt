# STANFORD AND NEVADA.
## First Intercollegiate Varsity Contest Will be Held on Campus Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
The Nevada eleven, which will
line up tomorrow against the
Varsity, will, while at the Univer
sity, be looked after by a committeo
consisting of C. K. Sludley, '03, J.
C. McCaughern, '03, H. P. Kuhn,
'03, J. Giles, '05, and J. M. Beach,
'03, chairman. While here the
Nevada men will stop at Encina
and will have a table reserved for
them at the University Inn. Sun
day morning the visitors will re
turn to Reno for a week's hard
practice before they return to play
California on the Ist of November.
The game tomorrow will be
close and hard fought. Nevada is
reported as being in the pink of
condition. The only game of im
portance which the eleven has
played took place in Reno on the
18th, when the Reliance Athletic
Club was defeated 18-0. Of the
eleven men who go into the match
five have played Stanford before.
Smith, the giant guard who tips
the beam at 210 pounds and stands
six feet and six inches in his
stockings, played year before last
when Nevada defeated Stanford
6-0 and last year when Nevada
lost 12-0. Full-back Evans, Car
ney at right end, Reardon, who
was elected captain in his sopho
more year on the strength of his
brilliant game, and O'Hara have
all met the Cardinal players before.
Steckle, the Nevada coach, who
was tackle and captain at Michi
gan two years and made the all-
American team in '99, regards Ne
vada's chances as more than even.
He says that the sagebrush boys
play hard, straight football, and
although they suffer from a lack of
practice games will give a good ac
count of themselves.
Captain Lee thinks that the
game will be the hardest of the
year except the final contest with
Berkeley, but expects to win by a
good margin. All the players'
weights could not be ascertained,
but from the character of the line
up Stanford should manage to wear
out her opponents and score heav
ily in the second half.
The teams will face each other
in the following order:
