Tomorrow the Varsity plays its
annual game with the University
of Nevada. Nevada's team was for
many years considered a second
rate aggregation, but its work for
the last two years has been on a
par with the very best on the Coast.
Stanford's relations with the men
from the sagebrush state have ever
been marked by the utmost cor
diality, and it is with considerable
pleasure that we again welcome
them to the campus. We would
have them consider everything
about the place their ownâ€”except
the match in the afternoon.
