The Seniok class has a deficit of
about $300 to pay as a result of the
publication of last year's Quad.
The announcement is especially
interesting when taken in connec
tion with the fact that last year
'02 started out with $500 in the
treasury and at the end of Senior
week reported assets amounting to
eighty cents.
Once before in the history of the
University has a class shouldered
the deficit of a Quad management.
That the class cannot in an v way
control the expenditures of the
manager and editor; that the man
agement receives the gain,
while the class must stand
good for any loss, is manifestly
unfair. The remedy is the
institution of a new system
or the taking of precautions which
will insure the class from loss.
California students have had expe
riences which have induced them
to put their annual in charge of a
Board, since no one person could
he found who would assume the re
sponsibility. There having always
been plenty of candidates for the
managership, Stanford has not had
to meet any such contingency. The
solving of the problem seems an

easy one when it is remembered
that the student body treasurer and
the managers of student body pub
lications are put under bonds. The
experience of 1903 should be of
considerable benefit to future
classes.
