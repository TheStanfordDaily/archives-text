# Second Team Shines in Practice.
## 
### 
The Varsity seemed to be in a
severe slump last night, as it
struggled ineffectually against the
Second team in the light drizzle
which fell on the wet and slippery
field. No score was made during
the half-hour scrimmage until
darkness made accurate playing
impossible and in the confusion the
Varsity secured the ball on a fum
ble and sped down the field for a
touchdown. The scrubs were
quite effective in holding the Var
sity for downs, and although they
lost in punting, they had the bet
ter of the argument in carrying the
ball on bucks. The slump of the
first eleven is unexplainable. There
seemed to be little interest in the
play, and the men did"not put up
the hard game of which they are
capable. Should they defeat
Nevada tomorrow it will be by
better football than was in evidence
last night.
