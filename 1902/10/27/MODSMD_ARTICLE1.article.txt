# STANFORD DOWNS NEVADA
## Cardinal Evidenced its Superiority in an Interesting Game by the Score of 11 to 5. 
### 
The hopes of the Nevada eleven
have been disappointed, Stanford's
misgivings allayed, and once again
the Cardinal has shown its suprem
acy over the light Blue and White.
The eleven men from Reno who
trotted onto the gridiron last Sat
urday to measure strength with the
Varsity played a game which
showed them worthy foemen as of
old, but the strong defense of the
Stanford line prevented other
score than the five points made on
a place-kick from the twenty-five
yard line. Of the eleven points
scored by the Varsity six were the
result of a brilliant run by McGil
vray for which Bansbach furnished
admirable interference, one from
Lee's goal, and five by the hard,
consistent bucking of the* Varsity
backs.
Nevada received Lee's kick-off
and inaugurated the game with a
series of tackle-back plays, the
formation which she relied on for
most of her gains throughout the
contest. She made first down once
and then was forced to punt, Frie
sell sending the ball ten yards
within Stanford territory. Stan
ford fumbled almost immediately,
but before the sagebrush players
could get well under way McGil
vray secured the ball on a fumble
and made his sensational run of
fifty-five yards to a touchdown.
Little Bansbach started the heavy
full-back in motion after he had
secured the ball and then trailed
behind blocking every attempt of
the despairing Nevada players to
tackle the fleeing runner. From a
position immediately in front of
the goal posts Captain Lee sent the
pigskin squarely between the bars,
giving Stanford a score of six points
to nothing before the play had en
dured five minutes.
On Nevada's kick-off "Savage"
Dole secured the ball and sped
down the field twenty yards before
he was tackled on the thirty-five
yard line. An exchange of punts
followed, and with the ball on the
forty-yard line Magee attempted a
drop-kick for goal. The ball fell
short and "Nevada made a miser
able punt after failing to advance
the ball, and Stanford carried it
over for a touchdown by straight
bucks after getting possession on
the twenty-yard line. Lee missed
goal. There was no further score
during the half, although a field
goal by Nevada from the forty-five
yard line was unsuccessful by a
very narrow margin.
Nevada opened the second half
by sending the ball well into Stan
ford territory and almost at once
Kehrlein made the fumble which
gave Nevada her only score. It
was Nevada's ball on the thirty
yard line. Mass plays on guard
and tackle carried it ten yards
nearer the Stanford goal, and then
Stanford held for the third down.
As the bleachers saw that Neva la
would try for a field goal, the Cry
of " Block that kick," " Block that
kick," came in sharp, staccato
therefrom, but to no avail. The
line held; the ball went straight

toward its mark and skimmed the
cross-bar for Nevada's only score.
The remainder of the half was oc
cupied by the magnificent efforts of
the Cardinal to score, which were
rendered ineffectual only by their
inability to keep from fumbling
when within striking distance of
the goal. End runß by Magee and
line bucks brought the ball to the
twenty-yard line, when the big
right tackle had the ball snatched
from almost his very hands by
Nevada's giant guard, Smith. Ne
vada punted out of danger and
again Stanford carried the ball
down the field without check only
to be interrupted in its procession
by the call of time with the ball
only ten yards from another touch
down.

In many ways the game was
gratifying to Stanford sympathizers,
while in others it was bitterly dis
appointing. The team-work was
far from good. Individual ex
cellence rather than coherent col
lective play was responsible for the
big holes Stanford tore in her op
ponent's line. The fumbling was
execrable and totally unpardonable
at this time of the season. Yet on
the other hand the Stanford line
waß impregnable and formed a
bulwark the Nevada backs could
not scale. The individual work of
the team was, as a rule, good.
McGilvray at full-back played a
slashing game on the offensive and
proved strong and effective in back
ing up the line on defense. Mc-
Fadden at right tackle was a star,
while Sprott at left tackle showed
that the position which has hitherto
been weak has at last found the
man who can hold his own and
more against the sturdiest oppo
nent. The agile Freshman opened
up holes in the line for his own
backs and was the first man
through in the attempt to block
punts. Hauverman put up a
plucky fight against the Nevada
center, who outweighed him fifty
pounds, while Lee on one side and
Barnhisel on the other, formed at
the center of the line a trio hard to
pierce. In punting Friesell clearly
outdid Magee, while little O'Hara
at Nevada's left end made his team
mate.* secore from attack at that
point.
Had the score been eleven to

Barnhisel on the other, formed at
the center of the line a trio hard to
pierce. In punting Friesell clearly
outdid Magee, while little O'Hara
at Nevada's left end made his team
mate.* secore from attack at that
point.
Had the score been eleven to
nothing it would have been a fair
indication of the comparative
merits of the two teams. In line
bucking and defensive work the
Cardinal showed itself to be strong.
In punting and end running it is
still weak, but will improve.
The hopes of the Nevada eleven
have been disappointed, Stanford's
misgivings allayed, and once again
the Cardinal has shown its suprem
acy over the light Blue and White.
The eleven men from Reno who
trotted onto the gridiron last Sat
urday to measure strength with the
Varsity played a game which
showed them worthy foemen as of
old, but the strong defense of the
Stanford line prevented other
score than the five points made on
a place-kick from the twenty-five
yard line. Of the eleven points
scored by the Varsity six were the
result of a brilliant run by McGil
vray for which Bansbach furnished
admirable interference, one from
Lee's goal, and five by the hard,
consistent bucking of the* Varsity
backs.
Nevada received Lee's kick-off
and inaugurated the game with a
series of tackle-back plays, the
formation which she relied on for
most of her gains throughout the
contest. She made first down once
and then was forced to punt, Frie
sell sending the ball ten yards
within Stanford territory. Stan
ford fumbled almost immediately,
but before the sagebrush players
could get well under way McGil
vray secured the ball on a fumble
and made his sensational run of
fifty-five yards to a touchdown.
Little Bansbach started the heavy
full-back in motion after he had
secured the ball and then trailed
behind blocking every attempt of
the despairing Nevada players to
tackle the fleeing runner. From a
position immediately in front of
the goal posts Captain Lee sent the
pigskin squarely between the bars,
giving Stanford a score of six points
to nothing before the play had en
dured five minutes.
On Nevada's kick-off "Savage"
Dole secured the ball and sped
down the field twenty yards before
he was tackled on the thirty-five
yard line. An exchange of punts
followed, and with the ball on the
forty-yard line Magee attempted a
drop-kick for goal. The ball fell
short and "Nevada made a miser
able punt after failing to advance
the ball, and Stanford carried it
over for a touchdown by straight
bucks after getting possession on
the twenty-yard line. Lee missed
goal. There was no further score
during the half, although a field
goal by Nevada from the forty-five
yard line was unsuccessful by a
very narrow margin.
Nevada opened the second half
by sending the ball well into Stan
ford territory and almost at once
Kehrlein made the fumble which
gave Nevada her only score. It
was Nevada's ball on the thirty
yard line. Mass plays on guard
and tackle carried it ten yards
nearer the Stanford goal, and then
Stanford held for the third down.
As the bleachers saw that Neva la
would try for a field goal, the Cry
of " Block that kick," " Block that
kick," came in sharp, staccato
therefrom, but to no avail. The
line held; the ball went straight

toward its mark and skimmed the
cross-bar for Nevada's only score.
The remainder of the half was oc
cupied by the magnificent efforts of
the Cardinal to score, which were
rendered ineffectual only by their
inability to keep from fumbling
when within striking distance of
the goal. End runß by Magee and
line bucks brought the ball to the
twenty-yard line, when the big
right tackle had the ball snatched
from almost his very hands by
Nevada's giant guard, Smith. Ne
vada punted out of danger and
again Stanford carried the ball
down the field without check only
to be interrupted in its procession
by the call of time with the ball
only ten yards from another touch
down.

In many ways the game was
gratifying to Stanford sympathizers,
while in others it was bitterly dis
appointing. The team-work was
far from good. Individual ex
cellence rather than coherent col
lective play was responsible for the
big holes Stanford tore in her op
ponent's line. The fumbling was
execrable and totally unpardonable
at this time of the season. Yet on
the other hand the Stanford line
waß impregnable and formed a
bulwark the Nevada backs could
not scale. The individual work of
the team was, as a rule, good.
McGilvray at full-back played a
slashing game on the offensive and
proved strong and effective in back
ing up the line on defense. Mc-
Fadden at right tackle was a star,
while Sprott at left tackle showed
that the position which has hitherto
been weak has at last found the
man who can hold his own and
more against the sturdiest oppo
nent. The agile Freshman opened
up holes in the line for his own
backs and was the first man
through in the attempt to block
punts. Hauverman put up a
plucky fight against the Nevada
center, who outweighed him fifty
pounds, while Lee on one side and
Barnhisel on the other, formed at
the center of the line a trio hard to
pierce. In punting Friesell clearly
outdid Magee, while little O'Hara
