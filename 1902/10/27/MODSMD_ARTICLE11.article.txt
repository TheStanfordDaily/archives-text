E. Baker of Oakland preached a
sermon on "Happiness." He
showed that Christianity is essen
tially happy, that man is placed
here to enjoy life, and not to pro
hibit all its pleasures. His text is
found in I Tim. 6:17: "Trust in the
living God who giveth us richly all
things to enjoy." In part he said:
The purpose of the university is
to create an interest in humanity.
We have to specialize to win a live
lihood, but none of us want to be
lost in our profession, like the
Frenchman of whom it was said,
He was born a man and died a gro
cer." We should believe that this
is the best day and the best hour
that God has ever given, and use
the good gifts of God. Paul says,
"Do good." He tells rich people to
use their wealth for pleasure, —but
to find that pleasure in charitable
helpfulness.
