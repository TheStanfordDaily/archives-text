# Rooters Held Rally.
## 
### 
Probably the most successful
rooters' meeting ever held at Stan
ford was that of Friday night. De
spite inclement weather the chapel
was crowded. A splendid spirit
was shown in response to the
calls of the song and yell leaders.
Cleveland Baker, '04, led the sing
ing of "Hail, Stanford, Hail,"
"Down with California," "The
Best Company," as well as several
of the best known of the old songs.
"The Best Company," written by
C. H. Baker, '04, and H. E. Bush,
to the air "Dutch Company,"
was very well received. The yell
leaders, H. P. Kuhn, '03, and J. C.
Taylor, '04, put the rooters through
all the yells, and developed a uni
son and enthusiasm that promises
well for the big game.
