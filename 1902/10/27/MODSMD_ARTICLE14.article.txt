# Back on the Squad.
## 
### 
The last week has been produc
tive of considerable dissension as a
result of a case of infraction of
football training rules last Friday.
Assistant Coach Slaker gave his
consent to the attendance of the
members of the squad at the
Freshman game in Berkeley, pro
vided each man should return to
the campus on Saturday night, no
excuse to be accepted for failure.
Paul Tarpey, '05, first substitute
for quarter, did not return until
Thursday, having spent the inter
vening time in San Francisco. On
Sunday morning Captain Lee also
went to the city, and did not re
turn until Thursday. In the
meantime neither coaches nor
Trainer Moulton had been informed
of tb3 whereabouts of the two
players.
Moulton asked for the dismissal
of Tarpey from the squad, on the
ground that he had knowingly
broken the stipulations of the
coach. With the consent of Slaker
Tarpey's name was dropped, and
he did not appear for practice
Thursday or Friday. At the noon
meal on Saturday Lee explained
the reason for which Tarpey had
considered himself compelled to re
main in San Francisco, and by the
unanimous consent of those on the
training-table, Tarpey was re
instated.
