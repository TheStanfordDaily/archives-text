# CENTURY'S GREATEST MAN.
## Dr. Charles R. Brown Forcefully Analyzes Sources of Lincoln's Strength. 
### 
Dr. Jordan introduced Dr.
Charles Reynolds Brown in the
chapel this afternoon in these
words: "Mr. Brown has been a
Stanford professor and used this
room as his schoolroom long
enough to need no introduction."
In fact the speaker was heartily
greeted and renewed his hold on
the Stanford audience by his cus
tomary strong, direct way of put
ting things, and by an unusually
inspiring address. His subject
was"The Greatest Man of the
Nineteenth Century," and he spoke
in part as follows:
"Sometimes the unhappy asser
tion is made that there are no great
men nowadays, but this is dis
proved by the long line of men,
great in every field, the nineteenth
century has produced. Examples
are Herbert Spencer, who is per
haps the greatest philosopher of all
the ages; Darwin,the greatest scien
tist; and the men who have carried
on financiering as it was never
before known. A great man can be
said to be one who by his work
makes some period of history differ
ent from what it would have been
without it. The greatness of a man
in comparison with others may be
determined by the length of the
period which his influence affects
and the importance of his in
fluence.
"There is one war that surpasses
all similar events of the century in
importance, and which is import
ant from whatever side it is viewed,
but principally because it brought
together and welded fast in unity
two divided parts of a nation. I
mean the civil war of '61 and '65.
Many men had an important share
in the work and did their work
well, but Lincoln above all had the
conduct of it, and to him belongs
the highest honor of the century.
"Lincoln had six main hin
drances to contend against. They
were: First, an empty treasury,
second, the inexperience of a party
which had not had the conduct of
affairs for a long time; third, the
burdensome counsel of a differing
body of advisers; fourth, the con
trary European sentiment; fifth,
a powerful despondent factor
among the Northerners; and last, a
strong, armed militant portion of
the Union. If Lincoln had not
been so great a man he would have
been advised to death.
" Lincoln's greatness may be
analyzed as containing four main
elements: First, his power of com
bining lofty idealism and practical
accomplishment; second, his ability
to recognize and utilize the best
policy; third, his closeness to the
people, caused by his integrity,
plain sense,and humor; and fourth,
his moral quality and political in
tegrity. He wrought out his ideals
in practical efficiency, he refused to
be bound by any party lines, he
recognized the main great issue, he
did not flatter or bully the people
but reasoned with and respected
them, he was almost alone in his
time in political disinterestedness
and as a result at the day of his

death lie was the most absolute
ruler in Christendom and his
spirit lived after him. The great
humanity of the man touched the
heart of the people.
"In many ways the resemblance
between this great man and the
greatest of men, the Son of Man,
is remarkable. lie is the noblest
type of Christian democracy the
world has ever seen."
