# Song-Books Out Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The new song books for 1902 are
to be out tomorrow, and will be put
on sale on the bleachers at the foot
ball practice. They will be bound in
red with a picture of the new gym
nasium on the fly-leaf. They will
contain all the new and the best
old songs and yells, and will cost
fifteen cents.
