# Easy Victory for California.
## 
### 
California defeated Reliance Sat
urday by a score of 17-0, using
twenty men in the course of the
game. Had it not been for the fact
that so many substitutes were played
the score might have been greater,
but the result was satisfactory.
Team work was the strong .feature
of the gfime for California, there
being little individual playing of
the star order.
