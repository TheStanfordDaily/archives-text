Aside from the defensive strength
exhibited by the Varsity in Satur
day's game with Nevada, there was
no sign contributive of more color
to the prospect for a Cardinal show
ing at the Intercollegiate than the
effectiveness and volume of the
cheering and singing of the rooting
section on the bleachers. To say
that it was the best of the year
counts for but little; by comparison
with Saturday's efforts the bleach
ers have been silent all the season
through. The singing was melodi
ous —in so far as the adjective may
be applied to mob-effort of this na
ture —but that is of small conse
quence beside the fact that it, as well
as the cheering, was full-voiced,
showing every man in the section
was behind it with all the power of
his lungs. The Friday night song
practice, combined with the appear
ance of another capable yell-leader,
has already put the cheering depart
ment into better shape than the
conditions of three weeks ago had
given reason to hope for.
