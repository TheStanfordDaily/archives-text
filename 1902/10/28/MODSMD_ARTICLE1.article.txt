# UNIVERSITY MEETINGS.
## Fortnightly Gatherings of Students and Faculty to Become Custom at Stanford. 
### 
The following announcement was
issued from the President's oflice
this afternoon:
Notice to Professors and Stu
dents: On alternate Wednesday
mornings, beginning with Novem
ber sth,there will a be general meet
ing of students and instructors in
the Assembly Hall at the third
hour, 10:15 to 11:15. All students
are expected to be present, and
members of the instructing body
are urged to be present also. Uni
versity exercises will be suspended
for the hour in question, and the
Library and laboratories will be
closed. There will be appropriate
and interesting exercises, including
addresses and music, and it is
hoped that all men and women of
the University will make it a point
to attend these meetings and so
contribute to their interest and suc
cess.
The regular Tuesday evening
lecture course will henceforth be
discontinued. David S. Jordan,
Oct. 28, IIJO2.l l J02. President.
The foregoing action is the result
of the energetic work of Professor
Max Farrand of the History de
partment, together with the hearty
cooperation of President Jordan.
Sunday afternoon, at the request
of Professor Farrand, about a dozen
prominent undergraduates met in
his room, and the desirability of
having some such gathering of the
entire student body was explained
to them. It was pointed out that
the Stanford spirit is not so strong
as it should be, and that there is a
great need of something to unify
the undergraduate body.
Professor Farrand outlined his
scheme, the substance of which is
seen in President Jordan's an
nouncement. The meetings are to
be a permanent feature, and they
will be student body gatherings in
every sense of the word. All reci
tations for the hour will be given
up, and something that is rarely
ever done will be seen in the abso
lute closing of the laboratories,
library, gymnasium, and every
thing that has any connection with
University work. Thus there will
be no excuse for the absence of a
single student from these big gath
erings.
The nature of the exercises will
be such as to promote the greatest
amount of college spirit. The Glee
Club will always be present to lead"
in the singing. At the first meet
ing, on Wednesday, Nov. sth, Dr.
Jordan will give an address ex
plaining the objects of the gather
ing, and Professor Farrand will
give a general talk to the students.
For the future exercises the inten
tion is to have some man of note
from outside the University address
the meeting, and in addition there
will always be one address by a
member of the faculty.
The gatherings will be orderly
in every way. There is no inten
tion whatever on the part of the
originators that there shall be a
general "rough house." There is
to be plenty of noise in connection

with giving the yells and singing,
but the general tone is to be digni
fied. The lower lloor of the Assem
bly Hall will be reserved for the
men students, while the gallery is
to be occupied by the women mem
bers of the University. All the
members of the faculty are to be
present.
The general consensus of opinion
among the students who have
known of the plan is that the pro
posed meeting of the entire student
body supplies a want that has been
felt ever since the University
opened. The plan is in fine work
ing order in other universities, par
ticularly at Michigan and Cornell.
At Yale and Princeton all the
students are brought together every
morning at chapel service. About
once a week at the close of chapel
service the meetings are turned
into regular student body gather
ings.
