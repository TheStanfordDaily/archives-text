With eleven years of history be
hind it, and with all the equipment
and potential strength of a great
University, Stanford still has in its
student life the problems of a new
institution passing through the
formative period. The foremost of
these problems is the crystalliza
tion of the much-lauded but griev
ously dormant—in some quarters
said to be even disintegrating —
Stanford spirit. President Jordan
and I)r. Farrand, with their
plan for University meetings,
have discovered the key to the
solution. In decreeing that one
hour every two weeks shall be de
voted absolutely to the purpose of
"getting together,"in ordering class
room, laboratory, library, and
every routine activity suspended,
and in requesting that members of
the faculty as well as of the student
body attend, they have introduced a
custom that fits perfectly our cam
pus life. At Cornell, at Michigan,
at California, where plans similar
to this have been putin practice,
the result has been the unification
of the Btudent body. Perhaps this
is more strikingly true at Berkeley,
where the disintegrating forces of a
large number of students living in
a large number of places made
amalgamation especially difficult.
Here at Stanford, where our life
and our interests are so concen
trated, the environment is pecul
iarly favorablfl, the method of com
ing together uniquely appropriate.
Not only are the living quarters of
a majority of up within a radius of
a few hundred yards from the quad
and the heart of the institution
itself, but the proximity and con
venience of every recitation-room
and laboratory to a meeting center,
will make the gathering come as a
natural and not an artificially
stimulated factor in our ordinary

life. For this student body should
and can have, as none other in the
world, a feeling of superb unity
and of aggressive determination.
What we need, what we want, and
what these meetings will accom
plish, is the exercise of this spirit,
latent with unmeasured possibili
ties. It is not the spirit merely
that wins football games or grace
fully acquiesces in defeat. Nor is
it that which exults in victory or
doggedly forces itself to yell in ad
versity merely as a matter of duty.
It is rather a deep, unwavering
love for our college and all that it
means, a feeling that will cause
intense mutual sympathy between
Stanford men wherever they may
meet. And now we are coming to
gether. We are going to sing
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," and give
the good old slogans as they never
have been given before. We nre,
for an hour every two weeks, going
to sing and cheer and listen to men
of note, forgetting that we are Law
majors or Chemistry majors, Cali
fornians or New Englanders, fra
ternity or non-fraternity, athletes
or spectators, conspicuous or ob
scure, —forgetting everything but
that which embraces all in a pow
erful bond of fellowship—Stanford.
