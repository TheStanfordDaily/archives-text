# SNAPPY PRACTICE.
## Blocking Kicks and End Running Features of Yesterday's Work on Gridiron. 
### 
The Varsity evidenced a decided
superiority over the Second team
at last night's practice, playing a
fast, snappy game. The Varsity
men were drilled in breaking
through the line to block kicks,and
for twenty minutes before the reg
ular scrimmage the Second made
repeated attempts at place-kicks
from the twenty-five-yard line. In
most cases the scrub line could not
hold the Varsity players, but on
more than one occasion the ball
was sent fairly between the goal
posts. The half-hour preceding
dusk was utilized for a hard scrim
mage. The Varsity was compara
tively certain of making its downs,
but once or twice the Second held
well and took the ball away.
Straight line bucking carried the
ball from the kick-off to within scor
ing distance, when Dole carried it
around right end for a touchdown.
The interference for end runs has
improved considerably during the
last week, although there is still
much to be learned in this respect.
Butterfield, at right end on the 1
Second team, played a game of un
usually high order last night. His
work showed his defense to be as
strong as that of any man on the
field. Time after time the Varsity
tried him, only to have the runner
thrown behind the line. The
second kick-off to the Varsity Tar
pey secured the pigskin. The in
terference formed well and he ran
through the scattered field to the
fifty-yard line before he was
downed. On the next play he was
given the leather for a try between
end and tackle. He broke through
and with Bansbach as his only in
terference covered the remaining
distance for a touchdown.
There were some changes in the
personnel of the big eleven last
night. The places of the men in
jured in the Nevada game were
filled in a thoroughly efficient man
ner. Sprott was played at tackle,
Cooper at left end, and Tarpey at
the half Magee has been filling
ever since the Freshman game.
The men lined up for the scrim
mage as follows:
