# STANFORD WILL MEET UTAH.
## A 						Game Between the Two Universities Has Been Arranged for Thanksgiving Day. 
### 
Stanford will play the football
team of the University of Utah on
Thanksgiving Day at Salt Lake
City. Treasurer Edwards has for
several weeks been in correspond
ence with George C. lliser, the Utah
manager, and an agreement has
finally been reached. Edwards will
take fifteen men with him.
The Utah team is said to be much
stronger than usual, and will put
up an interesting fight for the Car
dinal players. They are somewhat
unfortunate in being isolated, and
thus unable to meet many teams
of equal merit. The Utah men
would like to arrange an annual
game with Stanford, and have for
some time offered inducements for
a trip to the Salt Lake region. Last
year a game was arranged between
Stanford's second team and the
Mormons, but did not materialize.
