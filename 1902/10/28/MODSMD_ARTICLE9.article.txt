# ROWING QUESTION AGAIN.
## President of U.C. Boat Club Investigates Possibilities of Maintaining Crew at Stanford. 
### 
J. F. Roadhouse, U. C. '04, pres
ident of the University of Califor
nia Boat Club, visited the campus
Saturday to discuss with the Fac
ulty Athletic Committee the advis
ability of establishing a boat club
at Stanford, and the outlook for in
tercollegiate boat-racing. The plan
has been discussed before, but this
is the first time that an actual
effort has been made on the part of
the University of California.
Roadhouse, advised by Prof. Smith,
visited the surrounding country of
the University in the hopes of find
ing a location for the boat club,
and found about three and one-half
miles from the campus a slough
where there is a constant water
supply. The slough is situated
near the Town and Gown club
house. Roadhouse found the roads
to the proposed situation of the
boat-house at Stanford good, and
stated that a temporary boat-house
could be built cheaply.
Roadhouse conversed with Pro
fessors Marx, Angel 1 and Smith of
the Faculty Athletic Committee,
who heartily approved his plan,
lie stated that the U. C. Boat Club
would encourage any effort 011 the
part of Stanford by lending boats
and giving advice as to the build
ing of a clubhouse, etc. The U. C.
club has a membership of one hun
dred, with six crews, and is ham
pered by the fact that the members
have to go eight miles to row; nev
ertheless it is in a flourishing con
dition.
