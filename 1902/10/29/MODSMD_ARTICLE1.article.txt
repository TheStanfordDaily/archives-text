# ROOTERS WILL PRACTICE
## Band and Glee Club to Assist in a Rousing Rally in the Chapel. 
### 
Another big rooters' meeting and
Bong practice will be held in the
chapel tomorrow night at 7:15.
Everything possible is to be done
to make it a successful gathering.
The new song-books will be avail
able for the first time, and on ac
count of the fact that secret prac
tice has commenced, this rally will
be one of a very few chances to
practice singing before the big
game. The Band will be out, and
the Glee Club can be counted on to
assist in the singing. It is imper
ative that everyone be present at
this meeting.
The change in the date to Thurs
day is owing to the Sophomore
Minstrels being scheduled for Fri
day. But two more jollification
gatherings are to take place before
the intercollegiate contest on the
Bth. Next Monday will see the
last song practice before the final
send-off to the team the following
Thursday night. Assembly Hall
is to be used for the latter as in
other years. The first meeting of
the entire University Wednes
day in Assembly Hall under the
new custom announced yesterday
will provide a substitute for an
additional rally,though it will par
take of none of the boisterous ele
ments of a rooters' meeting.
The song-books were put on sale
today and the cheer leaders have
requested that everybody provide
himself with a copy and bring it
along tomorrow night.
