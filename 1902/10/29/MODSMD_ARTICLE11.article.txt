## Indications Point to Signal Success for the Sophomore Minstrels. 
### 
The Sophomore Minstrel Show,
the proceeds of which will be used
in constructing a Varsity tennis
court, has but two more rehearsals
before its final production on Fri
day evening. Both of them will be
superintended by Mr. Task. Those
who witnessed the last rehearsals
expressed themselves in enthusi
astic terms of the show, especially
as it is a new undertaking at the
University.
The entertainment will open in
the usual manner with all the par
ticipants in a semicircle. Both
coon songs and lyrics will be sung,
interspersed with jokes and witti
cisms from the end men, who are
all experts with the bones and
tambourine. The musical selec
tions of this part of the show will
be sung by the leading singers of
the student body.
After an intermission of a few
minutes, the second part will open
upon a midway scene with its cir
cuses and shows, opposing barkers,
bands, and the usual mob. The
specialties will then be introduced
in appropriate style. These
stunts will be given by members
from the Glee and Mandolin Clubs,
Gymnasium Club, and Foil and
Mask.
The colored josh poster, printed
at the University Press, will be dis
tributed tonight.
The sale of tickets to date has
been greater than for any previous
play or farce at the University.
As the show will be rather long the
curtain will be raised at 8 p.m. in
stead of 8:30 as previously an
nounced.
