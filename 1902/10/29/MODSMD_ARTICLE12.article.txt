# Students Win at Basket-Ball.
## 
### 
The basket-ball game of Satur
day between the faculty assistants
and the students of the gymnasium
resulted in a score of 13 to 3 in
favor of the latter. On account of
the threatening weather the game
was played in Encina gymnasium.
The halves were shortened because
of the untrained condition of most
of the players, but the play was
fast and the exhibition a good one,
considering the fact that neither
team had had much opportunity
to practice. The faculty assistants'
team was made up as follows: cen
ter, H. Martin, '03; forwards, Dr.
Snow and R. R. Long, '05; guards,
Instructor Chappel and C. W.
Thomas, '03. Students' team: cen
ter, N. Collyer, '04, and T. H. Col
bert, '06; forwards, C. E. Waite,
'03, E. C. Beach, '05, F. P. Whit
aker, '04, J. H. Cahoon, '06;
guards, W. Dole, '03 (captain),
R. H. Gaither, '06.
