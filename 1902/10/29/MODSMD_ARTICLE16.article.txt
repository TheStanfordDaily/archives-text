The visit of the president of the
University of California Boat Club
Saturday again brings before the
students the old and much dis
cussed question of adding a new
intercollegiate event to the athletic
calendar. The subject has come
up in one way or another ever since
the opening of the University. The
efforts of the California manage
ment to bring about intercollegiate
rowing contests, and their offers to
assist Stanford in every way to get
the scheme started are very com
mendable. Although the matter of
rowing ha√ü heretofore received very
little encouragement at this end, on
account of the distance from water
and the absence of facilities, the re
sult of President ltoadhouse's in
vestigation may be said to have
thrown new light on the question.
The Athletic Committee will doubt
less take the matter under consid
eration and report at an early date.
Although available water is only
three and one-half miles from the
campus, it is difficult of access and
trips would have to be covered in
buses. On the other hand, Cali
fornia's club-house is easily reached
by trolley lines. Regardless of the
many arguments pro and con, the
question is now in such a state as
to merit final settlement. Some
thing should be done in reference

to the project, and doubtless some
decision will be reached by the
Athletic Committee at its next
meeting. If there is any difficulty
in obtaining desirable information
the Daily Palo Alto will gladly
place at the committee's disposal
valuable material which it collected
last semester, in the shape of letters
from authorities at the Eastern
universities where rowing is a pop
ular and firmly established sport.
