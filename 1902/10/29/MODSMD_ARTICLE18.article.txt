Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I wish to state that the absence
of Paul Tarpey and myself from
the University during the last week
was absolutely necessary. The
reasons were known to the coach
and were afterward satisfactorily
explained to the trainer, the men
at the training - table, and the
student athletic committee.
I wish to state also that during
our absence such training rules
were observed by us as are de
manded from every man on the
squad by the coaches, the trainer,
and myself. Howard 8. Lee,
Captain Football Team.
