Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It was the criticism of a San
Francisco paper, after one of our
games with U.C., that the Stanford
yells and songs were intermixed
with profanity. To point out that
we are about to lay ourselves open 10
the same adverse criticism is the
object of this communication. We
must not forget that the opinion of
a large number of people concern
ing the University is influenced by
the way in which we conduct our
selves in the annual game with
California, and that if we sing our
prize song as it is sung in practice
on the bleachers our reputation
with many of those people will be
injured. The community requires
of college men that they be gentle
men, and we cannot afford to let
them think otherwise of us. Nor
can we tell how many athletes,
football captains, or good students
a lowering of ourselves in the pub
lic opinion will lose for us. The
author of this communication be
lieves that it represents conditions
as*they exist and that it does not
strain for over-nicety. It has not
been written without his first find
ing that a large number of students
are in sympathy with it. It is in
cumbent upon our song leaders to
sing the prize song as it is written,
and not as it has been mutilated.
