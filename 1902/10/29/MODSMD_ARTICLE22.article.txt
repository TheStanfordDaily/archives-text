# AGREE TO ARBITRATE
## Dr. Angell and Colonel Edwards Submit Controversy to University Club. 
### 
Yesterday Dr. Angell met Col
onel Edwards, chairman of the Cal
ifornia Athletic committee, at the
University Club in San Francisco,
and took definite steps toward the
settlement of the disagreement over
Warren Smith, the California half
back whose name was sent to Stan
ford in the list of eligible players.
It will be remembered that Smith
is the player who is accused of
professionalism.
The two chairmen agreed to
leave the controversy to an arbitra
tion committee which President
YVheelan of the University Club
shall select and over which he shall
preside. This committee will hear
both sides of the case next Satur
day night, and all evidence will be
submitted in writing. The docu
ments from Stanford will be pre
pared by Coach Carl L. Clemens
and Walter M. Rose, '95, a San
Francisco attorney who has taken
great interest in the matter.
A settlement was also reached as
to future interpretation of the ob
scure clause in the Athletic Agree
ment regarding universities of
equal standing. Hereafter all men
coming from an institution which
grants the degree A. B. or the
equivalent will have to be a regu
larly enrolled student for a year be
fore he can enter an intercollegiate
contest. This will exclude Santa
Clara College, St. Mary's College,
Pomona College, and many other
schools, students from which have
hitherto been played without ques
tion.
Colonel Edwards withdrew the
name of Johnston without contest,
having become convinced of John
ston's ineligibility through a letter
received from Johnston himself.
