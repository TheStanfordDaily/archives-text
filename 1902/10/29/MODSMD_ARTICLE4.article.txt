# SECRET PRACTICE BEGINS
## Varsity and Second Line Up Before Empty Bleachers to Develope New Plays. 
### 
Disappointed spectators were
turned away from the football field
last night, when the squad held the
first severe practice of the season.
The coaches have decided that from
now until the big game the team
will play protected from inquiring
eyes. Today's was the last open
practice of the year. There is a
necessity for developing new forma
tions, and perfecting some of the
.trick plays that have been tried
with indifferent success during the
first of the season. The coaches
have several new ideas which will
be tested, and it is safe to say that
some of the features of the inter
collegiate game will be as new to the
Stanford rooters as to those of
Berkeley. Preceding secret work
there will be a short period of open
practice every afternoon.
Next week the Varsity will be
lined up for signal work in the
morning, as well as being given a
hard scrimmage every night. The
coaches, when approached on the
subject of the new formations,
showed the greatest reticence, and
would divulge nothing of their
character.
