# LAST OPEN PRACTICE.
## Varsity, with Strong Interference, Scores on Second Team at Will. 
### 
The scrimmage last night was
one which filled the crowded
bleachers with enthusiasm. The
Varsity played the game as they
have failed to do consistently in
the past, and showed that with
spirit and dash they are a fust,
scoring team.
From the middle of the field
Sprott carried the ball twenty
yards, with Tarpey interfering.
From the twenty-five-yard line Lee
sent the ball over the cross-bar on
a clean place-kick. Three times
more the ball was carried to a
touchdown by the eager Varsity.
Tarpey at half played a strong
game, being steady on his feet and
giving manful aid when another
had the ball. Butterfield was tried
at end on the Varsity, where his
work was of the same high order
that has given him this chance.
Several trick plays were success
fully manipulated, Dole carrying
the ball twenty yards down the
field on a fake kick.
"Charley" Fickert, '98, last
year's head coach, viewed the prac
tice from the bleachers, and ex
pressed himself as much pleased
with the progress the team has
made during the last two weeks.
"The line," said the veteran, "plays
a strong, aggressive game, and the
team-work is improving every
day."
Of the Second team, Christy
played a good game at tackle, and
Smith behind the line broke
through for several good gains.
Coach Slaker roused enthusiasm to
a high pitch when he dropped into
his former position at full-back and
tore holes in the line in his old
time manner. The bleachers gave
him the varsity yell of his old col
lege, with "Slaker" tacked on the
end of the "Chicago." Beginning
tonight, secret practice is to be
held from now until the big game,
although there will be a short peri
od of open work each evening be
fore the bleachers are cleared.
The men who played were:
