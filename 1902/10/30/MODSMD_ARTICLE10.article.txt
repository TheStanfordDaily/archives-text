# DEATH OF SCHWARTZ, '99.
## Former Student Body President and "Daily" Editor Suddenly Stricken with Appendicitis. 
### 
Word was received this afternoon
of the death of Charles Erneet
Schwartz, Economics '99, which oc
curred in Alameda this morning.
Beyond the fact that the cause was
appendicitis, no details of the sad
event are available.
Schwartz was in his student
undergraduate days regarded as
one of the strongest men in the
student body. He was prominent
in student activities and held many
positions of honor and trust.
He entered Stanford in the fall
of '95, registering from Elkville,
111., as an Economics major, having
prepared for college at the Southern
Illinois State Normal. In his
freshman year Schwartz was made
an associate editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, becoming its managing
editor the second semester of his
sophomore year, and editor-in-chief
the semester following. During
his second year he served on the
Executive Committee of the Associ
ated Students, and was president of
his class the second semester. He
was an associate editor of the
Stanford Quad, vol. V. At the
end of his junior year he was
elected president of the Associated
Students, a position he filled with
great dignity and judgment. Since
graduation Schwartz has been
teaching and became this year
principal of the Longfellow school
at Alameda. From 1899 to 1901
he was the alumni editor of the
Alumnus. In 1899, directly after
graduation, he compiled an alumni
directory.
Dr. Jordan said this afternoon:
"I am very sorry indeed to hear
of the untimely death of Mr.
Schwartz. As a student he won
the respect of everyone. He was
able, willing and intelligent. As
president of the student body he
showed great tact and excellent
judgment. In his subsequent ca
reer as teacher he had marked suc
cess and showed great promise of
reaching a high rank in his chosen
profession. As a staunch and
loyal alumnus he brought honor
to the name of Stanford."
