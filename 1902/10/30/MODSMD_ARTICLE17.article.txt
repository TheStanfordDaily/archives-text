As the University gets further
away from the pioneer days the
efforts of the Museum Curator to
gather a collection of mementoes
relating to events in campus life
that have become historic seem to
be particularly worthy of recogni
tion. A request was made last
year for posters and similar relics,
but very little response was elicited.
Once more Curator Peterson has
issued an earnest appeal to the
students, and it is to be hoped that
those who are in possession of any
interesting material in the nature
of posters, programs, and souvenirs
of any description will see the
urgent need of getting such an ex

hibit well established. It is the
intention to set aside a room for
these mementoes, and in time the
collection will be of great interest
to both students and visitors.
