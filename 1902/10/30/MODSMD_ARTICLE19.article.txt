The coming county election is
one which marks the beginning of
a new era in the politics and politi
cal methods of Santa Clara county.
Instead of the voter being presented
with a choice between two unde
sirable opposing candidates, each
of whom might be under obliga
tions to the same group of bosses,
he will this year be confronted by
a list of capable and honest candi
dates, selected by the rank and iile
of the Republican party, and under
no obligations to any boss or group
of politicians.
For many years previous to the
present campaign, a small group
of political manipulators controlled
the party machinery and was in
fluential in the selection of the
candidates of all parties. As the
Republican was the dominant
party, it operated largely through
that organization. At times their
control was so complete that they
deliberately dispensed with pri
maries and boldly appointed the
delegates to the party conventions.
At other times they made the pri
maries simply blinds behind which
they worked, taking care that (he
will of the party should not find
expression through the primary.
This control was so absolute that
it not only dictated party nomina
tions and party organization, but
it even extended its control to the
schools of San Jose, the State
Normal School, and in many cases
to the juries in important criminal
and civil cases.
Theehange that has been brought
about during the present year is the
resultof energetic efforts on the part
of the Republican tiood Govern
ment League, which was organized
six years ago, and which has been
unceasing in its efforts to better the
conditions in the county. The mem
bers of the League believed that the

practical and effective way to i in -
prove the political conditions in the
county was to rescue the traditional
party organizations from the con
trol of this small group of politi
cians. When the members of the
League were refused a hearing
through the Republican primaries
four years ago, they promptly made
nominations for office, and fought
for the election of good men, upon
whatever ticket their names might
appear; and in many cases the
League candidates were elected.
The work of the league was diffi
cult, for it had to fight the inertia
of traditional party affiliation and
organization, and the power of
historic party names.
The passage by the last Legisla
ture of a Primary Election Law
gave the League a chance to con
trol the regular Republican organi
zation and name, and to use these
for the betterment of the county.
Hy dint of hard work, petitions
bearing the signatures of a major
ity of the voters of the county were
obtained and presented to the
Supervisors, thus forcing the ex
tension of the Primary Law to
every precinct of the county. Then
the battle for the control of the Re
publican primaries began. The
members of the party were aroused,
and such an outpouring of voters
to the primaries occurred on
August 12th as was never before
seen on such an occasion in Cali
fornia. And when the list of dele
gates selected to represent the
party in county convention was
scanned, it was noticed that the
old-time politicians were conspic
uously absent. Many prominent
ranchers, merchants, lawyers,
physicians, etc., were among the
one hundred and fifty delegates.
This was the first convention to
meet in Santa Clara county which
had been selected under the forms
of law. The evident independence
of the delegates caused a large
number of candidates to appear
in the field and strive for nomina
tion to the various offices. It is
probable that this convention had
presented to it a larger number of
capable, self-respecting candidates
for office than ever before appeared
before a convention in the county.
The task of selecting a ticket was
no light one. No one had prepared
a "program," and no man's pro
gram would have been considered
by that convention. The ticket,
selected after twelve hours of
balloting, is answerable to no indi
vidual or group of individuals. It
represents the whole membership
of the party. The election of this
ticket will contribute to better con
ditions in the county, and will
strengthen the control of the Re
publican party by its better ele
ments. The Republican party ap
peals not only to all loyal Repub
licans, but to all persons of what
ever political affiliation, who are
in favor of good government, to
support the candidates whose inde
pendence of control, whose char
acter, and whose mode of selection
mark a distinct advance in the
political life of Santa Clara county.

The coming county election is
one which marks the beginning of
a new era in the politics and politi
cal methods of Santa Clara county.
Instead of the voter being presented
with a choice between two unde
sirable opposing candidates, each
of whom might be under obliga
tions to the same group of bosses,
he will this year be confronted by
a list of capable and honest candi
dates, selected by the rank and iile
of the Republican party, and under
no obligations to any boss or group
of politicians.
For many years previous to the
present campaign, a small group
of political manipulators controlled
the party machinery and was in
fluential in the selection of the
candidates of all parties. As the
Republican was the dominant
party, it operated largely through
that organization. At times their
control was so complete that they
deliberately dispensed with pri
maries and boldly appointed the
delegates to the party conventions.
At other times they made the pri
maries simply blinds behind which
they worked, taking care that (he
will of the party should not find
expression through the primary.
This control was so absolute that
it not only dictated party nomina
tions and party organization, but
it even extended its control to the
schools of San Jose, the State
Normal School, and in many cases
to the juries in important criminal
and civil cases.
Theehange that has been brought
about during the present year is the
resultof energetic efforts on the part
of the Republican tiood Govern
ment League, which was organized
six years ago, and which has been
unceasing in its efforts to better the
conditions in the county. The mem
bers of the League believed that the

practical and effective way to i in -
prove the political conditions in the
county was to rescue the traditional
party organizations from the con
trol of this small group of politi
cians. When the members of the
League were refused a hearing
through the Republican primaries
four years ago, they promptly made
nominations for office, and fought
for the election of good men, upon
whatever ticket their names might
appear; and in many cases the
League candidates were elected.
The work of the league was diffi
cult, for it had to fight the inertia
of traditional party affiliation and
organization, and the power of
historic party names.
The passage by the last Legisla
ture of a Primary Election Law
gave the League a chance to con
trol the regular Republican organi
zation and name, and to use these
for the betterment of the county.
Hy dint of hard work, petitions
bearing the signatures of a major
ity of the voters of the county were
obtained and presented to the
Supervisors, thus forcing the ex
tension of the Primary Law to
every precinct of the county. Then
the battle for the control of the Re
publican primaries began. The
members of the party were aroused,
and such an outpouring of voters
to the primaries occurred on
August 12th as was never before
seen on such an occasion in Cali
fornia. And when the list of dele
gates selected to represent the
party in county convention was
scanned, it was noticed that the
old-time politicians were conspic
uously absent. Many prominent
ranchers, merchants, lawyers,
physicians, etc., were among the
one hundred and fifty delegates.
This was the first convention to
meet in Santa Clara county which
had been selected under the forms
of law. The evident independence
of the delegates caused a large
number of candidates to appear
in the field and strive for nomina
tion to the various offices. It is
probable that this convention had
presented to it a larger number of
capable, self-respecting candidates
for office than ever before appeared
before a convention in the county.
The task of selecting a ticket was
no light one. No one had prepared
a "program," and no man's pro
gram would have been considered
by that convention. The ticket,
selected after twelve hours of
balloting, is answerable to no indi
vidual or group of individuals. It
represents the whole membership
of the party. The election of this
ticket will contribute to better con
ditions in the county, and will
strengthen the control of the Re
publican party by its better ele
ments. The Republican party ap
peals not only to all loyal Repub
licans, but to all persons of what
ever political affiliation, who are
in favor of good government, to
support the candidates whose inde
pendence of control, whose char
acter, and whose mode of selection
mark a distinct advance in the
political life of Santa Clara county.

The coming county election is
one which marks the beginning of
a new era in the politics and politi
cal methods of Santa Clara county.
Instead of the voter being presented
with a choice between two unde
sirable opposing candidates, each
of whom might be under obliga
tions to the same group of bosses,
he will this year be confronted by
a list of capable and honest candi
dates, selected by the rank and iile
of the Republican party, and under
no obligations to any boss or group
of politicians.
For many years previous to the
present campaign, a small group
of political manipulators controlled
the party machinery and was in
fluential in the selection of the
candidates of all parties. As the
Republican was the dominant
party, it operated largely through
that organization. At times their
control was so complete that they
deliberately dispensed with pri
maries and boldly appointed the
delegates to the party conventions.
At other times they made the pri
maries simply blinds behind which
they worked, taking care that (he
will of the party should not find
expression through the primary.
This control was so absolute that
it not only dictated party nomina
tions and party organization, but
it even extended its control to the
schools of San Jose, the State
Normal School, and in many cases
to the juries in important criminal
and civil cases.
Theehange that has been brought
about during the present year is the
resultof energetic efforts on the part
of the Republican tiood Govern
ment League, which was organized
six years ago, and which has been
unceasing in its efforts to better the
conditions in the county. The mem
bers of the League believed that the

practical and effective way to i in -
prove the political conditions in the
county was to rescue the traditional
party organizations from the con
trol of this small group of politi
cians. When the members of the
League were refused a hearing
through the Republican primaries
four years ago, they promptly made
nominations for office, and fought
for the election of good men, upon
whatever ticket their names might
appear; and in many cases the
League candidates were elected.
The work of the league was diffi
cult, for it had to fight the inertia
of traditional party affiliation and
organization, and the power of
historic party names.
The passage by the last Legisla
ture of a Primary Election Law
gave the League a chance to con
trol the regular Republican organi
zation and name, and to use these
for the betterment of the county.
Hy dint of hard work, petitions
bearing the signatures of a major
ity of the voters of the county were
obtained and presented to the
Supervisors, thus forcing the ex
tension of the Primary Law to
every precinct of the county. Then
the battle for the control of the Re
publican primaries began. The
members of the party were aroused,
and such an outpouring of voters
to the primaries occurred on
August 12th as was never before
seen on such an occasion in Cali
fornia. And when the list of dele
gates selected to represent the
party in county convention was
scanned, it was noticed that the
old-time politicians were conspic
uously absent. Many prominent
ranchers, merchants, lawyers,
physicians, etc., were among the
one hundred and fifty delegates.
This was the first convention to
meet in Santa Clara county which
had been selected under the forms
of law. The evident independence
of the delegates caused a large
number of candidates to appear
in the field and strive for nomina
tion to the various offices. It is
probable that this convention had
presented to it a larger number of
capable, self-respecting candidates
for office than ever before appeared
before a convention in the county.
The task of selecting a ticket was
no light one. No one had prepared
a "program," and no man's pro
gram would have been considered
by that convention. The ticket,
selected after twelve hours of
balloting, is answerable to no indi
vidual or group of individuals. It
represents the whole membership
of the party. The election of this
ticket will contribute to better con
ditions in the county, and will
strengthen the control of the Re
publican party by its better ele
ments. The Republican party ap
peals not only to all loyal Repub
licans, but to all persons of what
ever political affiliation, who are
in favor of good government, to
support the candidates whose inde
pendence of control, whose char
acter, and whose mode of selection
mark a distinct advance in the
political life of Santa Clara county.
