# LELAND STANFORD.
## An Account of His Life in California from 1852 to Completion of Central Pacific Railway. 
### 
Mr. Eugene Soule, instructor in
Manual Training, came to Cali
fornia the same year that Leland
Stanford did, and was closely con
nected with him until his death.
We herewith present a fuller ac
count of Mr. Soule's lecture in the
chapel Tuesday evening than it
was possible to give in Wednes
day's paper.
Leland Stanford was born near
Albany, N. Y., in 1824, and was
the fourth of seven sons. He at
tended district schools winters and
worked on farm in the summer.
When about eighteen years of age
his father gave him a tract of tim
ber to cut and sell, which brought
about $2000. He took his earnings
and educated himself for a lawyer.
He studied with Bume very eminent
lawyers in Albany, and was ad
mitted to the bar after about three
years. He practiced law for a while
in Albany, but his ambition led
him to seek new fields in the West.
He went to Wisconsin, and located
at Port Washington, not far distant
from Milwaukee. He established a
fair business in law after about two
years of practice. He then returned
to his old home and married a very
estimable young lady by the name
of Jane L. Lathrop. He took his
bride and went to his Western home.
In 1852 he lost his library by fire,
which was a severe loss to him;
and the town did not warrant the
expansion in his business that his
ambition required. Having two
brothers in California who were
doing a good business, he concluded
to try his luck with them, and
arrived in California in July, 1852.
He joined his brothers in the mer
cantile business at Michigan Bluff,
in Placer county. He continued in
business in the mountains until
1856, when he went into business
in Sacramento, forming a partner
ship with his brother Josiah, under
the name of Stanford Bros., and
was very successful as a merchant.
He was one of the first to organ
ize the Republican party in Cali
fornia. He was a candidate for
office on one or two occasions, but
was defeated by the opposing party.
He was very popular as a citizen
and business man and had no per
sonal enemies. Somewhere about
1857-58, the discovery of silver
mines in Nevada caused great ex
citement and emigration to that
part of the country. The necessity
of transporting a very large amount
of machinery and supplies to the
mines, which had to be done by
the slow and expensive method of
ox and mule teams, suggested the
plan of building a railroad for that
purpose. A few of the business
men of Sacramento furnished
means from their individual re
sources to make a preliminary sur
vey. Theo. D. Judah, a very ener
getic civil engineer, was employed
to make the surveys for five dif
ferent routes, and the engineer re
ported the one by way of Illinory
town and Dutch Flat was the
most feasible, least expensive to
build, and nearest to a uniform
grade. Leland Stanford, Col lis P.
Huntington, Mark Hopkins, and
Charles Crocker formed a company,
with E. B. Crocker, Edward Mil
ler, and Theo. I). Judah, under the
name of California Central Pacific
R. R., with Stanford as president,
Huntington as vice-president, Mark

Hopkins as treasurer, Charles
Crocker as superintendent, Ed.
Crocker as attorney, Ed. Miller as
secretary, and Theo. 1). Judah as
chief engineer. Their attorney,
E. B. Crocker, framed a charter
providing for the issuing of bonds
to the amount of $8,000,000, to
construct a railroad to the State
line. The charter was submitted
to the California Legislature, and
on the 27th day of June, 1861, the
bill was passed in accordance with
the laws of the State of California.
None of these men had ever had
any experience in the construction
of railroads, nor were any of them
connected with wealthy parents.
Every one of them had to shift for
themselves at the beginning of
their business life, but they were
all of them at the age when energy
and perseverance were at their best.
The capital controlled by these
men cut but a small figure in the
great enterprise they were about to
engage in, where millions would be
involved; but their untiring energy,
perseverance and pluck succeeded.
In June, 1860, Leland Stanford
was elected delegate to the national
Republican convention at Chicago,
with instructions to use all his in
fluence for the nomination of Abra
ham Lincoln for President. Stan
ford worked zealously for Lincoln's
nomination, and became a very
earnest friend of Lincoln's. Lin
coln was elected President in the
autumn of 1860 and inaugurated
in March, 1861. Stanford was in
vited to attend the inauguration
while in Washington, or at the
national capitol. He was chosen
a representative for California.
He was admitted to the Cabinet as
a counsellor for California, and his
knowledge of the conditions of the
country rendered valuable aid.
The instructions given him were
fully carried out to the entire satis
faction of the Government. Dur
ing the time he was in Washington
his friends in California were push
ing him to the front as a candidate
for Governor. They wrote to him
for his acceptance, and he wrote
back declining the offer; but his
friends suppressed the answer, held
a convention, and nominated him
by a large majority.
It became very evident that the
South would secede from theFederal
Government.OnStanford's return he
went immediately to work examin
ing the condition of affairs in
Califorrnia. He found the people
of the State nearly equally divided
in sentiment in favor of the North
and South. In the autumn of 1861
Stanford was elected Governor.
The news of his election was hailed
with great joy at Washington. The
Administration knew the right man
was in the right place. Among his
first official acts was to re-organize
the State militia, requiring all to
take the oath of allegiance to the
Federal Government. Those who
could not conscientiously take the
oath were asked to resign, as it
would not do to allow any mem
bers to remain in the service who
were not strictly loyal to the Fed
eral Government. Some resigned,
others took their places. He
placed all the State arms in pos
session of those loyal to the Gov
ernment. Stanford then formed a
company of fifty trusted citizens
which he called the National
Guards, had them thoroughly
drilled and armed from the State
Armory so as to be ready at the
tap of an alarm bell. I was one
of those guards.
