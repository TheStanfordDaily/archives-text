# “CHAPARRAL” TO ORGANIZE.
## Self-Perpetuating Board the Method of Control Adopted by Editors. 
### 
The experimental existence of
the Chaparral is about to come to
an end with the adoption by the
staff of a constitution that will pro
vide for a permanent method of
management and control.
Heretofore the founders and sub
sequent editors have deemed it ex
pedient to keep the paper as the
private property of the editors, in
order to prevent interference from
the outside and to avoid student
body politics.
Before taking this step of turning
the paper over to the control of a
board, the editors have carefully
investigated the self-perpetuating
boards and publishing companies,
which control most of the college
publications. The plan finally
hit upon is similar to that of the
Princeton Tiger and Cornell Widow.
Under it the paper will be con
trolled by a self-perpetuating board
which will elect a president and
treasurer to oversee the editing and
managing work. Once each year
it will elect a limited number of
new members to the board from
among the best contributors. The
profits of the paper are to be di
vided equally among the senior
members of the board.
This method of control is new at
Stanford, and its success will be
eagerly watched by those who wish
to see the Sequoia and the Daily
Palo Alto removed from the pale
of student politics.
