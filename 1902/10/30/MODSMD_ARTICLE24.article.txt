# EMPLOYMENT BUREAU BUSY.
## Head of the Woman's Department Reports Encouragingly of the Semester's Work. 
### 
Misß Kathryn 11. Kip, '03, who
has charge of the woman's branch
of the Student Employment Bu
reau, maintained by the Christian
Associations, has supplied the
Daily Palo Alto with the follow
ing information covering this
semester's work of the Bureau to
date:
All the women who entered the
University this fall with the idea
of working their way are satisfac
torily located. Seven of the young
women who earned their way here
last year came back in September
with funds (earned by summer
work, etc.) to carry them through
the college year. Twelve others re
turned to work, having made ar
rangements in May for this year.
It is the experience of the Bureau
that a girl seldom needs help in
finding work after her first year—
if she is a reasonably good worker.
But one old student applied this
year for a place— and that because
the agreement made in May did
not hold, through no fault of her
own.
Fourteen Freshman girls regis
tered for employment this fall.
These were all located inside of two
weeks; and calls for more have
been coming in ever since. At
present twenty-six women are reg
istered, fourteen of whom earn all
their living expenses at the Uni
versity, and a few out of the four
teen earn also enough for clothing,
etc.
As to the kinds of work: At
present 13 girls are doing house
work, A taking care of children, 2
doing sewing, 1 typewriting, 2 tu
toring (History, French, German,
Spanish), and 7 doing "odd jobs,"
which includes laundry agencies,
door-bell tending, office work, and
irregular employment at house
work, care of children, etc. This
makes 29 in all — accounted for by
the fact that some girls do several
kinds of work.
There have been unsupplied calls
for workers as follows: Housework,
8; care of children,3; table waiting,
1; companion, 3; sewing, 1; music,
2. Of these, the first four offered
room and board, —so that 15 more
girls could have found places this
fall. As far as possible men work
ers have been supplied, but there
are some places into which men
will not fit, and these we have been
obliged to leave unfilled.
