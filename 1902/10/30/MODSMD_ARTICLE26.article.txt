â€”Miss Dorothy Goodsell, who
sang at the organ recital last Sun
day afternoon, is to appear again
at the University in the near
future. Those hearing her Sunday
were given a treat, ns she is con
sidered one of the hest sopranos on
the Coast. Miss Goodsell will un
doubtedly appear often at recitals,
as she is soon to establish regular
singing classes in Palo Alto.
