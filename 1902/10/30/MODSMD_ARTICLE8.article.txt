# MINSTREL SHOW TOMORROW.
## Sophomores Will Aid Tennis Men With Many Stunts and Joshes. 
### 
The Sophomore Minstrel Show,
for the benefit of the tennis court
that is to be, is scheduled for to
morrow night, and promises to be
so successful that already the mak
ing of it an annual affair is con
templated. The rehearsals have
been much better than the man
ager expected, new "stunts," jokes,
and joshes turning up at every
practice. The songs will be apt
and suited to the character of the
show. The committee in charge of
the show have collected an im
mense number of local hits and
joshes. There will be "knocks" ga
lore. It is understood that every
University organization which has
ever made a serious mistake, every
individual who in his college ca
reer at any time rendered himself
conspicuous in the eyes of the
bleachers or the student body, will
be ruthlessly exposed by the un
scrupulous barkers and end-men.
Every feature of a professional
minstrel show has been introduced
by Mr. Task. Specialties which
have been kept in reserve will be
made use of. The pieces have been
set to music by Organist Scott
Brook, who has been getting an ap
propriate orchestra together to
accompany the songs.
It is expected that every one who
attends the entertainment will
bring his song-book, as the inter
mission will be taken up with a
rally. Books will be on sale at the
Assembly Hall for all those who
have not yet purchased them.
The curtain will be raised
promptly at 8 p.m. Up to 3 p.m.
today over two hundred and fifty
dollars' worth of tickets had been
sold.
The program for the evening will
be as follows:
