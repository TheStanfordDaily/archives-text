# FINAL PRELIMINARY GAME.
## Varsity Meets Reliance on Campus Tomorrow for Last Practice Game of Season. 
### 
While Stanford's rival of a week
ago, Nevada, is struggling against
the California players tomorrow,
the Stanford Varsity will be op
posing the team defeated by Berke
ley last Saturday. It was origin
ally intended to hold this game on
the new grounds in the city, but
owing to the fact that they are yet
unfinished the contest will take
place on the University campus.
One result of the secret practice the
team has been holding during the
last half-week will be in evidence.
Magee will be in the match, and he
and Tarpey will play left end and
right half together. Tarpey, who
is weak on backing up the line, will
go to end on defense, but will be
behind the line when the Varsity
is carrying the ball. The game
will be fast and hard, as the Var
sity will undoubtedly play to out
do Berkeley's score of last week.
The line-up will be:
