The last issue of the University
of California Occident speaks thus
judiciously of Stanford's objection
to Johnston:
Her action was wholly beyond
any legal form, it was much in the
same spirit as that of a spoiled
child of tender years who "won't
play" unless you play his way.
There is absolutely no ground for
Stanford to stand on in this matter,
it was a high-handed proceeding
from the beginning and our acqui
escence did not mean that we be
lieved her contention right. We
believe Johnston perfectly eligible,
regard him as a member of the
team and hope to see him wear his
'OG sweater along with his fellows
who escaped the childish wrath of
our badly scared opponents.
In view of Colonel Edwards' re
cent admission that Johnston was
ineligible, the above is about as
timely as it is judicious. But that
is not all. It is the Occident's
general attitude which is lament
able. With such characterizations
as "a kindergarten for infants,"
"not fair play," "childishness,"
"undignified and utterly unsports

manlike conduct," the Occident
vents its wrath at Stanford. AÂ«k
Colonel Edwards about these
things, Occident.
In striking contrast to the atti
tude across the hay, comes the fol
lowing editorial,from today's Stan
ford Sequoia, which states the
position of our student body. It is
refreshing when placed alongside
the Occident's bitter article:
Should we not look for co-opera
tion from California in any effort
which makes for cleaner athletics?
This from a California professor
whose name, for obvious reasons, is
withheld, has the right note:
"Neither California nor Stanford
should permit any man to play,
against whom there is the slightest
taint of suspicion. In tiiis in
stance California is throwing a
boomerang of mud." The Sequoia
wishes to add its word of appeal to
those that have already been
spoken. Let us settle this diffi
culty without bitterness. Get an
absolutely impartial committee and
abide by its decision. And then
when it is settled say no more
about it.
