# Football for the Week.
## 
### 
The spirit on the gridiron has
run high during the past week.
Snappy scrimmages on the field
have called forth spirited cheering
from the bleachers, while coaches,
Varsity, and Second team have
been working manfully to the per
fection of a crack eleven. The team
is rounding into shape fast. Al
though there have been several
changes in the Varsity line-up of
last week, the new men are learn
ing the positions which they may
fill in the big game.
Freshman Sprott seems to be a
fixture at the tackle left vacant by
Stillman's injury. His game in
offensive work is much stronger
than on the defensive, however.
He is quick to get through on place
kicks, and rarely fails to open a
hole in the line when the buck is
coming his way. Butterfield, who
has been tried at left end, has
played a smashing game, but will
be supplanted tomorrow by Tarpey
and Magee, who will alternate at
this position. It is hard to say
whether or not this arrangement
will prove advantageous, but at
present it offers an opportunity of
giving both men a chance to show
themselves at their best.
In the line, Hauverman at center
and Lee and Barnhisel at guards
appear fo be fixtures. This trio
work well together and supply an
invulnerable armor against attacks
on center. McFadden is playing

the best game of his life at tackle.
His work is aggressive on defense,
and he can be used to advantage in
carrying the ball. At end Bartell
is in every play, and follows the
ball unerringly.
Behind the line the state of
affairs is encouraging. Bansbach
holds the team together admirably,
and uses good generalship in di
recting the plays. Those backs
who have been used consistently
this week —McGilvray, Dole, and
Tarpey—are strong ground gainers.
McGilvray is the best man for line
bucks, Dole the most consistent for
all-around playing, and Tarpey re
sponds best to the call for an end
run.
Of the other men, A. Dole and
Jacobs are playing well in the line,
and each stands a good chance to
figure in the big game. Smith at
half-back is almost sure to be given
a place in the Intercollegiate con
test. The team-work is improving
rapidly, and the Interference on
end runs is much stronger than a
fortnight ago. On defense the line
is effective, but when the Varsity
has the ball there is still room for
improvement.
