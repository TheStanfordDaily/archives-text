# LELAND STANFORD.
## An Account of His Life in California from 1852 to Completion of Central Pacific Railway. 
### 
(Continued from yesterday's paper.)

The Legislature convened in De
cember, 1862, at the old Court
House in Sacramento. As that was
a very severe and wet winter the
levees broke in December, and
members of the Legislature had to
go to their hotels and back to the
Capitol in boats. The Legislature
adjourned in January, '63, to San
Francisco. After getting the mem
bers together again at San Fran
cisco the loyalty of the members
was investigated. Those who were
not loyal to the Federal Govern
ment were either impeached, or
had to resign. All the leading agi
tators for the cause of secession had
to leave the State. United States
Senator Gwinn, Judge Terry of the
Supreme Court of California, Todd
Robinson, Zae Montgomery, and
all other leaders of the cause of se
cession were required to leave the
State or be imprisoned. All left.
No gathering of the agitators of
secession or speeches were allowed
at this time. Everything was at
once nipped in the bud, and there
was no chance left for them. The
Government authorities had all the
United States forces on the Coast
either resign or take the oath of
allegiance. Many resigned and
joined the rebel army in the South.
In all cases where any demonstra
tions against the Government were
manifested they were at once sup
pressed. Zae Montgomery pub
lished a defiant paper in San Fran
cisco against the Federal Govern
ment. The result was, he had his
printing plant pitched out on the
street, and was notified that if any
more of his publications were ciru
lated he would have to go to Alca
traz prison and remain during the
war. Thus by Governor Stan
ford's vigilance and timely action
the State was saved from one of
the most determined and bloody
strifes that history ever recorded
in any country.
Stanford, not forgetting his rail
road interests, sent in 1861-62
their chief engineer and some others
with charts and surveys to Wash
ington, to push matters in getting
a hill through Congress to aid in
constructing the railroad to Ogden.
In the meantime, work was com
menced on the road. Understate
charter contracts were let for build
ing thirty-one miles of road to New
castle. A bridge costing $50, 000
was built across the American
river. This work was done by the
capital controlled by the company
under the State laws. The State
passed a bill guaranteeing the in
terest on figures at seven per cent,
per annum for twenty years. Sacra
mento county issued bonds for
$300,000 for twenty years at seven
per cent, per annum, Placer county
$250,000 on same conditions, also
San Francisco voted $600,000 in
bonds. All would have been ready
for use provided the authorities in
San Francisco had not refused to
issue the bonds the people voted
for. Then came the long litigation,
which resulted in a settlement after
a year's delay, by way of a com
promise by San Francisco offering
the company $400,000 as a consid
eration for a settlement. In the
meantime the company had real
ized all they could from the sale of
their bonds and from their own
private resources, and invested it

in building the thirty-one miles of.
railroad. Owing to the delay of San
Francisco in settling its part,
the others withheld the bonds and
aid that was given by the State
and counties until a settlement
was effected with San Francisco.
The Supreme Court had decided in
favor of the company, but further
delay was possible, and the com
pany deemed it advisable to accept
the $400,000 as a gift, as it would
unlock the issuing of the bonds
already voted for by the State and
counties.
In constructing the thirty-one
miles of railroad all the available
means the company controlled were
fully exhausted. The work had
to come to a dead-lock until the
settlement of the San Francisco
bonds. The construction of this
railroad antagonized many inter
ests, and caused the people of those
interests to say and do everthing in
their power to injure the company.
They called it the "Dutch Flat swin
dle,"and said that all this company
wanted was to get all the money
they could and then make a failure,
and also said that these men were
men who knew nothing about con
trolling or handling the amount of
capital required in the construction
of so great a work. Everything
that could be said or done to injure
them was done, making the outlook
very discouraging. But Stanford
had faith in the final success of
their undertaking.
By an act of Congress passed
July 1, 1862, aid was provided for
the construction of a railroad called
the Central Pacific, which had
already received a charter from the
State of California to build a rail
road to the eastern line of the State.
The Government entered into a con
tract with the Central Pacific Com
pany to build the road to the State
line on conditions which the Com
pany complied with. Certain re
quirements of the Government
were, to furnish materials and
construct the road, as follows:
Grades not to exceed 116 feet to the
mile, curves not to exceed 10 de
grees, rails not less than 60 pounds
to the yard, track 4 feet 84 inches
wide, all of American material.
Forty consecutive miles of railroad
and telegraph to be completed and
equipped before any subsidies were
to be paid by the Government,
which agreed to donate every alter
nate section of public lands to the
amount of five sections of land per
mile on either side of the railroad,
within ten miles of the railroad,
not sold or otherwise disposed of;
titles to be given for every forty
miles completed and accepted; also
a loan of $16,000 in bonds, or six
teen bonds at $1000 each per mile,
for the first seven miles; forty-eight
bonds, or $48,000 per mile for 150
miles. Bonds to hear six per cent,
interest for thirty years. Work
was to be completed by 1876. As
security for the bonds the Govern
ment took a mortgage on the whole
property to the extent of the bonds
issued. On the Bth day of Janu
ary, 1863, ground was formally
broken at Sacramento.
On May 20, 1869, the last spike
was driven by Governor Stanford,
and the simple inscription engraved
onthe gold spike representing thelast
one, "May God preserve the unity
of our country, as the railroad
unites the two great oceans of the
world."
After the last spike was driven
the locomotive from the Union
Pacific and the one from the Central

Pacific met and exchanged from
the head of each locomotive bottles
of water from the Atlantic and
the Pacific oceans, thus welding
the last link connecting the great
transcontinental railway, one of
the greatest achievements known
of its day.
It is to be understood that this
road was completed seven years be
fore the limit of the contract, and
that most of the work was done
during one of the greatest civil
wars ever known in history. The
demands of the Government neces
sitated an early completion of the
road, hence liberal concessions were
made and the work was vigorously
prosecuted. The Government needed
it for a military and postal road,
as a war measure. It possessed the
highest value in enabling the Gov
ernment to deal with the Indian
question; it protected the frontier
against Indian depredations, and
enabled the Government to con
centrate its entire effort on the sup
pression of the rebellion of the se
ceeding States, and to withdraw the
army from the protection of the
frontier. It established a trans
continental commerce, it settled a
large territory which was only in
habited by Indians. It turned the
arid lands of the desert into fer
tile fields.
To much credit cannot he given
to the projectors of this great under
taking. The work was vigorously
pushed from the beginning. The
men who personally conducted this
work battled with the elements on
the Sierra Nevadas,*lhey pledged
their fortunes, they took Govern
ment securities when they were
worth only thirty-five or forty
cents on the dollar, they prose
cuted the work when eminent engi
neers predicted it could not be done,
and made it a success. And now it
stands to their credit that every
dollar guaranteed by the State of
California, with interest, and every
dollarfor the counties of Sacramento
and Placer, with interest, is
paid in full; also every covenant
and contract entered into with the
Government has been paid in full.
This is more than can be said of
the Government. Instead of the
Government granting patents as
agreed upon, out of seven or eight
millions of acresthere has accrued to
this company but 2,875,884 acres.
In all these transactions Gov
ernor Stanford had the credit of
conducting all the legislation and
the general supervision of the road.
Stanford was always a favorite in
the National councils, and was al
ways highly respected for his
honesty and for his ability as the
promoter of the great under
taking he engaged in. We trust
that a magnanimous nation and
people will ever pay a willing and
just tribute to the memory of the
honored projectors of this great
work, who have in a measure
sacrificed their lives upon the altar
of their country's good.

aid that was given by the State
and counties until a settlement
was effected with San Francisco.
The Supreme Court had decided in
favor of the company, but further
delay was possible, and the com
pany deemed it advisable to accept
the $400,000 as a gift, as it would
unlock the issuing of the bonds
already voted for by the State and
counties.
In constructing the thirty-one
miles of railroad all the available
means the company controlled were
fully exhausted. The work had
to come to a dead-lock until the
settlement of the San Francisco
bonds. The construction of this
railroad antagonized many inter
ests, and caused the people of those
interests to say and do everthing in
their power to injure the company.
They called it the "Dutch Flat swin
dle,"and said that all this company
wanted was to get all the money
they could and then make a failure,
and also said that these men were
men who knew nothing about con
trolling or handling the amount of
capital required in the construction
of so great a work. Everything
that could be said or done to injure
them was done, making the outlook
very discouraging. But Stanford
had faith in the final success of
their undertaking.
By an act of Congress passed
July 1, 1862, aid was provided for
the construction of a railroad called
the Central Pacific, which had
already received a charter from the
State of California to build a rail
road to the eastern line of the State.
The Government entered into a con
tract with the Central Pacific Com
pany to build the road to the State
line on conditions which the Com
pany complied with. Certain re
quirements of the Government
were, to furnish materials and
construct the road, as follows:
Grades not to exceed 116 feet to the
mile, curves not to exceed 10 de
grees, rails not less than 60 pounds
to the yard, track 4 feet 84 inches
wide, all of American material.
Forty consecutive miles of railroad
and telegraph to be completed and
equipped before any subsidies were
to be paid by the Government,
which agreed to donate every alter
nate section of public lands to the
amount of five sections of land per
mile on either side of the railroad,
within ten miles of the railroad,
not sold or otherwise disposed of;
titles to be given for every forty
miles completed and accepted; also
a loan of $16,000 in bonds, or six
teen bonds at $1000 each per mile,
for the first seven miles; forty-eight
bonds, or $48,000 per mile for 150
miles. Bonds to hear six per cent,
interest for thirty years. Work
was to be completed by 1876. As
security for the bonds the Govern
ment took a mortgage on the whole
property to the extent of the bonds
issued. On the Bth day of Janu
ary, 1863, ground was formally
broken at Sacramento.
On May 20, 1869, the last spike
was driven by Governor Stanford,
and the simple inscription engraved
onthe gold spike representing thelast
one, "May God preserve the unity
of our country, as the railroad
unites the two great oceans of the
world."
After the last spike was driven
the locomotive from the Union
Pacific and the one from the Central

Pacific met and exchanged from
the head of each locomotive bottles
of water from the Atlantic and
the Pacific oceans, thus welding
the last link connecting the great
transcontinental railway, one of
the greatest achievements known
of its day.
It is to be understood that this
road was completed seven years be
fore the limit of the contract, and
that most of the work was done
during one of the greatest civil
wars ever known in history. The
demands of the Government neces
sitated an early completion of the
road, hence liberal concessions were
made and the work was vigorously
prosecuted. The Government needed
it for a military and postal road,
as a war measure. It possessed the
highest value in enabling the Gov
ernment to deal with the Indian
question; it protected the frontier
against Indian depredations, and
enabled the Government to con
centrate its entire effort on the sup
pression of the rebellion of the se
ceeding States, and to withdraw the
army from the protection of the
frontier. It established a trans
continental commerce, it settled a
large territory which was only in
habited by Indians. It turned the
arid lands of the desert into fer
tile fields.
To much credit cannot he given
to the projectors of this great under
taking. The work was vigorously
pushed from the beginning. The
men who personally conducted this
work battled with the elements on
the Sierra Nevadas,*lhey pledged
their fortunes, they took Govern
ment securities when they were
worth only thirty-five or forty
cents on the dollar, they prose
cuted the work when eminent engi
neers predicted it could not be done,
and made it a success. And now it
stands to their credit that every
dollar guaranteed by the State of
California, with interest, and every
dollarfor the counties of Sacramento
and Placer, with interest, is
paid in full; also every covenant
and contract entered into with the
Government has been paid in full.
This is more than can be said of
the Government. Instead of the
Government granting patents as
agreed upon, out of seven or eight
millions of acresthere has accrued to
this company but 2,875,884 acres.
In all these transactions Gov
ernor Stanford had the credit of
conducting all the legislation and
the general supervision of the road.
Stanford was always a favorite in
the National councils, and was al
ways highly respected for his
honesty and for his ability as the
promoter of the great under
taking he engaged in. We trust
that a magnanimous nation and
people will ever pay a willing and
just tribute to the memory of the
honored projectors of this great
work, who have in a measure
sacrificed their lives upon the altar
of their country's good.
(Continued from yesterday's paper.)

The Legislature convened in De
cember, 1862, at the old Court
House in Sacramento. As that was
a very severe and wet winter the
levees broke in December, and
members of the Legislature had to
go to their hotels and back to the
Capitol in boats. The Legislature
adjourned in January, '63, to San
Francisco. After getting the mem
bers together again at San Fran
cisco the loyalty of the members
was investigated. Those who were
not loyal to the Federal Govern
ment were either impeached, or
had to resign. All the leading agi
tators for the cause of secession had
to leave the State. United States
Senator Gwinn, Judge Terry of the
Supreme Court of California, Todd
Robinson, Zae Montgomery, and
all other leaders of the cause of se
cession were required to leave the
State or be imprisoned. All left.
No gathering of the agitators of
secession or speeches were allowed
at this time. Everything was at
once nipped in the bud, and there
was no chance left for them. The
Government authorities had all the
United States forces on the Coast
either resign or take the oath of
allegiance. Many resigned and
joined the rebel army in the South.
In all cases where any demonstra
tions against the Government were
manifested they were at once sup
pressed. Zae Montgomery pub
lished a defiant paper in San Fran
cisco against the Federal Govern
ment. The result was, he had his
printing plant pitched out on the
street, and was notified that if any
more of his publications were ciru
lated he would have to go to Alca
traz prison and remain during the
war. Thus by Governor Stan
ford's vigilance and timely action
the State was saved from one of
the most determined and bloody
strifes that history ever recorded
in any country.
Stanford, not forgetting his rail
road interests, sent in 1861-62
their chief engineer and some others
with charts and surveys to Wash
ington, to push matters in getting
a hill through Congress to aid in
constructing the railroad to Ogden.
In the meantime, work was com
menced on the road. Understate
charter contracts were let for build
ing thirty-one miles of road to New
castle. A bridge costing $50, 000
was built across the American
river. This work was done by the
capital controlled by the company
under the State laws. The State
passed a bill guaranteeing the in
terest on figures at seven per cent,
per annum for twenty years. Sacra
mento county issued bonds for
$300,000 for twenty years at seven
per cent, per annum, Placer county
$250,000 on same conditions, also
San Francisco voted $600,000 in
bonds. All would have been ready
for use provided the authorities in
San Francisco had not refused to
issue the bonds the people voted
for. Then came the long litigation,
which resulted in a settlement after
a year's delay, by way of a com
promise by San Francisco offering
the company $400,000 as a consid
eration for a settlement. In the
meantime the company had real
ized all they could from the sale of
their bonds and from their own
private resources, and invested it

in building the thirty-one miles of.
railroad. Owing to the delay of San
Francisco in settling its part,
the others withheld the bonds and

transcontinental railway, one of
the greatest achievements known
of its day.
It is to be understood that this
road was completed seven years be
fore the limit of the contract, and
that most of the work was done
during one of the greatest civil
wars ever known in history. The
demands of the Government neces
sitated an early completion of the
road, hence liberal concessions were
made and the work was vigorously
prosecuted. The Government needed
it for a military and postal road,
as a war measure. It possessed the
highest value in enabling the Gov
ernment to deal with the Indian
question; it protected the frontier
against Indian depredations, and
enabled the Government to con
centrate its entire effort on the sup
pression of the rebellion of the se
ceeding States, and to withdraw the
army from the protection of the
frontier. It established a trans
continental commerce, it settled a
large territory which was only in
habited by Indians. It turned the
arid lands of the desert into fer
tile fields.
To much credit cannot he given
to the projectors of this great under
taking. The work was vigorously
pushed from the beginning. The
men who personally conducted this
work battled with the elements on
the Sierra Nevadas,*lhey pledged
their fortunes, they took Govern
ment securities when they were
worth only thirty-five or forty
cents on the dollar, they prose
cuted the work when eminent engi
neers predicted it could not be done,
and made it a success. And now it
stands to their credit that every
dollar guaranteed by the State of
California, with interest, and every
dollarfor the counties of Sacramento
and Placer, with interest, is
paid in full; also every covenant
and contract entered into with the
Government has been paid in full.
This is more than can be said of
the Government. Instead of the
Government granting patents as
agreed upon, out of seven or eight
millions of acresthere has accrued to
this company but 2,875,884 acres.
In all these transactions Gov
ernor Stanford had the credit of
conducting all the legislation and
the general supervision of the road.
Stanford was always a favorite in
the National councils, and was al
ways highly respected for his
honesty and for his ability as the
promoter of the great under
taking he engaged in. We trust
that a magnanimous nation and
people will ever pay a willing and
just tribute to the memory of the
honored projectors of this great
work, who have in a measure
sacrificed their lives upon the altar
of their country's good.
(Continued from yesterday's paper.)

The Legislature convened in De
cember, 1862, at the old Court
House in Sacramento. As that was
a very severe and wet winter the
levees broke in December, and
members of the Legislature had to
go to their hotels and back to the
Capitol in boats. The Legislature
adjourned in January, '63, to San
Francisco. After getting the mem
bers together again at San Fran
cisco the loyalty of the members
was investigated. Those who were
not loyal to the Federal Govern
ment were either impeached, or
had to resign. All the leading agi
tators for the cause of secession had
to leave the State. United States
Senator Gwinn, Judge Terry of the
Supreme Court of California, Todd
Robinson, Zae Montgomery, and
all other leaders of the cause of se
cession were required to leave the
State or be imprisoned. All left.
No gathering of the agitators of
secession or speeches were allowed
at this time. Everything was at
once nipped in the bud, and there
was no chance left for them. The
Government authorities had all the
United States forces on the Coast
either resign or take the oath of
allegiance. Many resigned and
joined the rebel army in the South.
In all cases where any demonstra
tions against the Government were
manifested they were at once sup
pressed. Zae Montgomery pub
lished a defiant paper in San Fran
cisco against the Federal Govern
ment. The result was, he had his
printing plant pitched out on the
street, and was notified that if any
more of his publications were ciru
lated he would have to go to Alca
traz prison and remain during the
war. Thus by Governor Stan
ford's vigilance and timely action
the State was saved from one of
the most determined and bloody
strifes that history ever recorded
in any country.
Stanford, not forgetting his rail
road interests, sent in 1861-62
their chief engineer and some others
with charts and surveys to Wash
ington, to push matters in getting
a hill through Congress to aid in
constructing the railroad to Ogden.
In the meantime, work was com
menced on the road. Understate
charter contracts were let for build
ing thirty-one miles of road to New
castle. A bridge costing $50, 000
was built across the American
river. This work was done by the
capital controlled by the company
under the State laws. The State
passed a bill guaranteeing the in
terest on figures at seven per cent,
per annum for twenty years. Sacra
mento county issued bonds for
$300,000 for twenty years at seven
per cent, per annum, Placer county
$250,000 on same conditions, also
San Francisco voted $600,000 in
bonds. All would have been ready
for use provided the authorities in
San Francisco had not refused to
issue the bonds the people voted
for. Then came the long litigation,
which resulted in a settlement after
a year's delay, by way of a com
promise by San Francisco offering
the company $400,000 as a consid
eration for a settlement. In the
meantime the company had real
ized all they could from the sale of
their bonds and from their own
private resources, and invested it

in building the thirty-one miles of.
railroad. Owing to the delay of San
Francisco in settling its part,
the others withheld the bonds and
aid that was given by the State
and counties until a settlement
was effected with San Francisco.
The Supreme Court had decided in
favor of the company, but further
delay was possible, and the com
pany deemed it advisable to accept
the $400,000 as a gift, as it would
unlock the issuing of the bonds
already voted for by the State and
counties.
In constructing the thirty-one
miles of railroad all the available
means the company controlled were
fully exhausted. The work had
to come to a dead-lock until the
settlement of the San Francisco
bonds. The construction of this
railroad antagonized many inter
ests, and caused the people of those
interests to say and do everthing in
their power to injure the company.
They called it the "Dutch Flat swin
dle,"and said that all this company
wanted was to get all the money
they could and then make a failure,
and also said that these men were
men who knew nothing about con
trolling or handling the amount of
capital required in the construction
of so great a work. Everything
that could be said or done to injure
them was done, making the outlook
very discouraging. But Stanford
had faith in the final success of
their undertaking.
By an act of Congress passed
July 1, 1862, aid was provided for
the construction of a railroad called
the Central Pacific, which had
already received a charter from the
State of California to build a rail
road to the eastern line of the State.
The Government entered into a con
tract with the Central Pacific Com
pany to build the road to the State
line on conditions which the Com
pany complied with. Certain re
quirements of the Government
were, to furnish materials and
construct the road, as follows:
Grades not to exceed 116 feet to the
mile, curves not to exceed 10 de
grees, rails not less than 60 pounds
to the yard, track 4 feet 84 inches
wide, all of American material.
Forty consecutive miles of railroad
and telegraph to be completed and
equipped before any subsidies were
to be paid by the Government,
which agreed to donate every alter
nate section of public lands to the
amount of five sections of land per
mile on either side of the railroad,
within ten miles of the railroad,
not sold or otherwise disposed of;
titles to be given for every forty
miles completed and accepted; also
a loan of $16,000 in bonds, or six
teen bonds at $1000 each per mile,
for the first seven miles; forty-eight
bonds, or $48,000 per mile for 150
miles. Bonds to hear six per cent,
interest for thirty years. Work
was to be completed by 1876. As
security for the bonds the Govern
ment took a mortgage on the whole
property to the extent of the bonds
issued. On the Bth day of Janu
ary, 1863, ground was formally
broken at Sacramento.
On May 20, 1869, the last spike
was driven by Governor Stanford,
and the simple inscription engraved
onthe gold spike representing thelast
one, "May God preserve the unity
of our country, as the railroad
unites the two great oceans of the
world."
After the last spike was driven
the locomotive from the Union
Pacific and the one from the Central

Pacific met and exchanged from
the head of each locomotive bottles
of water from the Atlantic and
the Pacific oceans, thus welding
the last link connecting the great
transcontinental railway, one of
the greatest achievements known
of its day.
It is to be understood that this
road was completed seven years be
fore the limit of the contract, and
that most of the work was done
during one of the greatest civil
wars ever known in history. The

sitated an early completion of the
