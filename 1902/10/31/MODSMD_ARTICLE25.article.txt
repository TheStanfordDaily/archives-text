Editor Daily Palo Alto:
There have been many questions
asked concerning the ceremony of
the laying of the corner-stone of the
Gymnasiums At the time the an
nouncement was first made, early
in the semester, that the program
was to be entirely under the aus
pices of the students, it was report
ed that the corner-stone would be
laid sometime early in October.
The committee, under the instruc
tions of the president of the student
body, prepared a program which
was submitted several weeks* ago
to Dr. Jordan and the Executive
Committee, it was learned at that
time that Mrs. Stanford had left
word that it was her wish that the
ceremony should not 'lake place
until her return from the East.
With everything in readiness, the
whole matter is resting until the
return of Mrs. Stanford. This
rather full statement is considered
necessary in order to allay ..some
misconstructions that have been
put on the cause of the delay.
