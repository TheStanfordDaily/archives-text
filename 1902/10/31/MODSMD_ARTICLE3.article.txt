The grounds in the city are rap
idly nearing completion. Although
it was impossible to put them into
condition for the Varsity-Reliance
game tomorrow, by the middle of
next week everything will be in
shape for the Intercollegiate game.
The seating arrangements will be
better this year than ever before.
Five thousand seats on one side of
the field will be covered. The only
uncovered $2.50 seats will be those
in the middle of the gridiron,which
divide the rooting sections of Cali
fornia and Stanford. The seating
facilities will be of the best, a staff
of ushers having been recruited
from among the students of the two
universities.
