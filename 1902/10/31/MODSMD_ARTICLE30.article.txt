Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the Bu
reau of Animal Industry of the
United States Department of Agri
culture, lectured in the chapel yes
terday afternoon to a large audi
ence on the subject,"Protective and
Directive Coloration in Animals."
The lantern-slides were a particu
larly fine part of the entertain
ment.
Dr. Merriam said, among other
things: "Animals may be classed
under two general color heads:
first, the protective, colored to ren
der the animal invisible; and sec
ond, directive, colored to attract
attention. The coloring depends
largely on the haunts of the ani
mals. In the forests of the North
west they are dark. In the spear
shaped foliage of the tropics they
have alternate stripes of dark and
light. Again, they may be spotted
to resemble shadows cast by leaves.
On the arid plains the animals are
sober gray or yellow. One of the
noteworthy things about the color
ation of animals is the skilful work
of Nature in equipping them in
shades to hide themselves easily."
