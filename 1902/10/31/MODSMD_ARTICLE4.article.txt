# Housing Song Practice.
## 
### 
The rooters' rally and practice
held in the chapel last night was
the most enthusiastic and success
ful gathering held this year. The
room was filled early, and the sing
ing and cheering was kept up
until nearly nine o'clock. Kuhn
led the yells, while Baker took
charge of the songs. All the songs
were given with vim and vigor,
and the cheering was the best of
the year. The band played sev
eral selections. Treasurer Edwards
spoke in explanation of the sale of
the rooters tickets, saying that GOB
tickets are reserved for Stanford
and will be on sale Monday
morning. It was also announced
that rooters will mass on the main
floor of Assembly Hall at the Uni
versity meeting next Tuesday.
The next rooters' meeting, and
the last before the final rally of
Thursday night, will occur Monday
night, beginning sharply at 7:15.
The hour has been made early
that study may not be encroached
upon. The leaders have asked
that every man in the University
BE THERE WITH A SONG
BOOK.
