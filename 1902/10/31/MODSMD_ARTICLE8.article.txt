# Michigan vs. Wisconsin.
## 
### 
The biggest contest in Middle
Western football conies off in Chi
cago tomorrow, when Yost's team
of giants meets the University of
Wisconsin. So far the Michigan
men have shown up better in the
preliminary games, and have made
some large scores. Wisconsin's
showing, while not so brilliant,
gives ground for believing that the
contest will be the fiercest and
hardest fought game of the season.
Football experts predict a very
close battle, with the odds in favor
of Yost's eleven.
