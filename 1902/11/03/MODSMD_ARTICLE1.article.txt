# STANFORD 23, RELIANCE 5.
## Clubmen Kicked a Field Goal After Stanford Had Made Four Touchdowns. 
### 
With the exception of the first
minutes and last ten minutes of
Saturday's game the Cardinal
played fast football. Captain Lee
kicked off to the Reliance twenty
yard line, where Sprott secured the
ball. Although the Varsity play
ers had a chance to score early in
the contest, they had an attack of
their usual complaint and lost the
ball on downs before they were
warmed up to their work. Reli
ance took the ball four yards from
her own line and secured the jump
on her opponents for three succes
sive plays, advancing the ball fif
teen yards before she lost on a
fumble, when Bansbach fell on the
ball. Stanford braced and Mc-
Gilvray, Tarpey and Dole quickly
bucked through for a touchdown,
Lee kicking an easy goal.
With the score 6-0 against her
Reliance kicked to ;Tarpey, who
carried the ball in twenty yards.
The Cardinal was soon forced to
kick, and "Savage" Dole sent the
leather well into Reliance territory.
After losing ten yards on an at
tempted double-pass and thrown
back on an end run Reliance
fumbled and Dole fell on the ball.
Short bucks by Dole and Sprott
with a fifteen-yard run by Tarpey
added six more points to the Stan
ford score. The rest of the half
was full of exciting runs and good
line bucking,but nothing was added
to the score, although Wilfred Dole
tried for field goal from the twenty
five-yard line. The half ended
with the ball in Stanford's posses
sion on Reliance's twenty-yard
line.
Kartell opened the second half
with a brilliant run of fifty yards
from the kick-off with Bansbach
and Dole interfering. The remain
ing points were added to the score
in quick order. Short bucks by
Dole and McGilvray varied with
Tarpey's end runs and an occa
sional cross-buck by Sprott gave
the Cardinal two touchdowns more.
An almost complete change of line
up after the second touchdown, an
unfortunate fumble by Kehrlein,
and a successful place-kick by Wil
son of Reliance, presented the club
men with their first score of the
season. Stanford braced after this
unfortunate relapse, but was un
able to advance the ball materially
before time was called.
In most respects the game was
satisfactory. The line held well
except at the outset of the game,
and Stanford found no great diffi
culty in advancing the ball. Mc-
Gilvray was always sure of a good
gain, as was Dole, while Tarpey
was successful in running the ends
because of his ability to follow in
terference. Sprott evidenced a dis
position to make his yards when
ever called upon, and "Guiby"
Dole was used to advantage. The
line was invincible, the ends sure,
and the backs careful in helping
one another and the line-men. The
game Bhowed a marked improve
ment over the previous form.
