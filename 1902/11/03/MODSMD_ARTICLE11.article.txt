No one has attended the games
or the rooter√ü' practice who has not
been moved to words of enthusi
astic praise for the University
Band. But with this appreciation
there is not always a realization
that the amount of time devoted to
the organization by leader, man
ager, and players is much more
than many students putin for
several hours of University credit.
The members of the Band deserve
all the thanks we can extend to
them. It is to be regretted that
their only emolument is the satis
faction of having done their Uni
versity and their Varsity a good
turn. Their spirit is worthy of
emulation.
