In all the history of the Univer
sity there has never been in Ruble
such live college spirit as is mani
fest this year. The classes are ac
tive as units, but the most com
mendable phase is the genial
friendship that unites the girls as a
whole and is making the Hall a
real factor in Stanford life.
Last Saturday evening the
Juniors entertained the Freshmen
at an old-fashioned Hallowe'en
party. The upper-claesmen dressed
as nursee, the gueßts as babies.
The Seniors and Sophonwres took
their turn as rooters on the steps
with songs and yells composed for
the occasion.
