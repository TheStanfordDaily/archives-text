# Chester Murphy Returns.
## 
### 
"Chet" Murphy, '00, returned to
tho University Saturday from a
trip to his home in Salem, Oregon.
He will again join the corps of the
coaches and work with Clemens
and Slaker to round the eleven
into shape for Saturday's game.
Murphy was an interested onlooker
at last Saturday's Varsity-Reliance
contest. He expressed himself as
extremely gratified at the improve
ment which has taken place during
the month he has been away. The
two things which impressed him as
requiring the most attention were
the development of faster play and
better team-work. The men are
not quick enough in starting, and
are too apt to individualize in their
play, he thought. Murphy at
tended the morning Bignal practice,
which was held for the first time
today and which will be a regular
event until the Intercollegiate.
