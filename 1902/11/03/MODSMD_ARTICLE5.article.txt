# SUCCESSFUL MINSTRELS.
## Sophomores Prove Adept in the Field of Burnt-Cork Entertainment 
### 
Before an audience of about eight
hundred people the Sophomore
Minstrel Show was given in Assem
bly Hall Friday night with con
spicuous success. The first attempt
to hold an entertainment of this
nature at Stanford met with a
hearty welcome, and the labors of
the Sophomores were rewarded by
the placing of a substantial sum to
the credit of the new tennis courts.
The University Band played selec
tions before the curtain rose, and
the musical features were accom
panied by a specially arranged or
chestra, which did itself proud.
Consilering the short time devoted
to preparation and rehearsals, the
participants in the show are to be
given especial credit for the smooth
ness with which the action pro
gressed. A fault that could have
been arrested was the unintelligi
bility of some of the dialogue, due
to the propensity of the end men to
talk too rapidly and to address the
interlocutor instead of the audi
ence.
The curtain rose upon the cus
tomary minstrel setting, with the
chorus seated in a semicircle. E.V.
Kehrlein made a capital interlocu
tor, and the musical numbers were
all very well rendered. "Josephine,
My Joe," by H. D. Tracy, "My
Ebony Bell," by B. li. Cocks, and
"While Old Glory Waves," sung by
C. L. Firebaugh, were heartily en
cored by the audience. H. D.
Wheeler's solo on the banjo was a
particularly good number. The
end men all possessed excellent at
tributes as funny performers. H.
R. Tracy showed himself to be an
artist in specialties.
The Mandolin Club made a hit
in its first appearance of the year.
One of the best features of the en
tire program was the exhibition of
tumbling given by the Gymnasium
Club as the last number on the
program. The performance of the
gymnasts was characterized by
great precision and skill, and met
with round after round of ap
plause.
