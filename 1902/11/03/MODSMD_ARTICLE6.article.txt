# Wellesley Professor Lectures.
## 
### 
Miss Katherin Cowan, of Welles
ley College, the foremost of woman
professors of economics, addressed
the students in the chapel this
afternoon 011 the "Coal Strikes."
The history of the coal troubles was
reviewed, and the demands of each
side presented in a way that gave
evidence of a complete mastery of
the subject.
Dr. Jordan in his introductory
remarks took occasion to clear up
some misconceptions regarding the
University Assembly.
The old system of Tuesday even
ing lectures, he explained, had
been given up because few students
had been able to attend; because
as the University has grown larger
there are fewer opportunities for
the students to meet elbow to el
bow; and because the new institu
tion offers an opportunity for the
President or other Faculty repre
sentative to speak to the stu
dents.
