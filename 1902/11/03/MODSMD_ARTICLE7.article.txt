# DEMANDS OF THE CENTURY.
## Dr. Jordan Delivers Strong Address at Sunday Morning Chapel. 
### 
President Jordan gave a very in
teresting and instructive lecture to
a large audience in the chapel yes
terday morning on "The Demands
of the Twentieth Century." The
speaker did not attempt, he said, to
tell all he knew of the new century
nor to present new ideas of tho sub
ject, but rather to bring com
mon ideas together. ' In part Dr.
Jordan said:
Some 2,500 years ago the Proph
et Job said, "And it shall come to
pass . . . that your young
men shall see visions." This 1 shall
take, in a way, for my text. The
nineteenth century was character
ized by enterprise. Enterprise is
the putting of knowledge into
action. The eighteenth century
was thoughtful; the seventeenth
century was a time of awakening—
of revival in art, science, and liter
ature. The twentieth century is
strenuous, complex, and democrat
ic. We should be thankful to
President Roosevelt for coining the
word "strenuous" to designate the
new century. Because the century
is busy and complex, it must value
men for what they can do. There
will be plenty of work for men that
know, in the twentieth century.
Every engineer will be wanted.
Scientists will be needed, —science
is the result of honest experi
ment, properly tested, and then set
in order.
There will be room for all pro
fessions, but they must know posi
tively. Art and literature must be
more honest and direct. Teachers
must be of a higher order. The
question is not Who makes the
laws? but Who runs the schools?
Politics will represent wisdom and
cleanliness. Politicians must look
forward to final results. Men must
be strong, to save self-governing
nations from two evils: greed, and
irresponsible sentiment.
There is room for a religion that
lays stress on a working theory of
life. The color of life is red; and
the color of the religious life is go
ing to be red.
The new century will throw out
men it cannot use; they will be
condemned to labor on some other
man's job. I like to think of young
men as reservoirs of power, interest
ing for the possibilities in them.
The world is going to throw out
"rag-time" men; it demands men of
ideas. It wants men willing, if
necessary, to throw their lives
away. It wants clean men. The
human brain is the most delicate
of machinery; vice should not be
allowed to tamper with it. Vices
destroy accuracy; the twentieth
century demands accuracy.
