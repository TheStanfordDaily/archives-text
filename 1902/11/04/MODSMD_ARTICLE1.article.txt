# SUSTAIN STANFORD'S PROTEST
## Arbitration Committee Renders Decision against Warren Smith of California. 
### 
The Smith controversy is ended
and Stanford has won two import
ant points, both embodied in reso
lutions passed by the Arbitration
Committee which considered her
case. The first is that for which
Stanford has for years been con
tending, the settling of controver
sies by the mutual consent of both
faculty committees. The arbitra
tors censured the California athletic
department for submitting Smith's
case to the Pacific Athletic Associ
ation without Stanford's consent.
The first decision was made on Sat
urday night.
At the second sitting of the
committee last night the unani
mous judgment of the fourteen col
lege men was as follows: "Re
solved, That under article 111, sec
tion 2, of the intercollegiate agree
ment Warren Smith is a profes
sional."
Stanford's briefs and affidavits
were compiled by H. W. Rose, '95,
and C. L. Clemens, '98, and pre
sented to the committee by Dr. An
gel 1. Smith was then called in
and a recess taken during which
he and Manager Decoto carefully
examined Stanford's evidence, hav
ing been directed to Hie objections
in case they bo desired. California
attempted at various times to have
the negotiations stopped on techni
calities.
All parties admitted that Smith
received $450. A telegram from
Professor Hawthorn of the Oregon
faculty athletic committee in reply
to a query from Dr. Angell said
Smith was engaged upon the un
derstanding tliat he was a profes
sional and that he had been paid
$150 in a lump sum. Chester
Murphy, '00, submitted evidence
concerning Smith's personal ex
penses whereby it would seem that
Smith cleared something like $250
as a result of his work with the
University of Oregon. Numerous
other affidavits, some of them gath
ered by T. L. McFadden, '00,
showed Smith's statements to be
incorrect.
Considerable regret is felt that
"Locomotive" Smith should have
thus become involved in an argu
ment in which he shines in no way
advantageously. He has always
been regarded by Stanford players
as a man of sportsmanlike bearing.
The Arbitration Committe was
composed of fourteen men with F.
H. Wheelan, Harvard, president of
the University Club, in the chair.
A more representative body of
college graduates could hardly
have been selected. Besides Mr.
Wheelan the members were as
follows: Yale, Knox Maddox;
Harvard, George Lent; Vermont,
F. W. Van Sicklen; Virginia Mili
tary Institute, Marsden Manson;
Annapolis, G. H. Mendell; Uni
versity of London, W. C. B. Mc-
Donough; Princeton, T. C. Berry;
Rochester, C. P. I'omery; Michigan,
John C. Kirkpatrick; Lehigh, W.
\V. Thurston; Cornell, W. P. San
born; Brown. \V. Blaisdell; Hamil
ton, Charles P. Eells; University of
Toronto, J. E. Tucker.
