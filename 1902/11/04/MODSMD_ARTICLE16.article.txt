Tomorrow morning at the third
hour the first of the University
Assemblies will be held. There is
an erroneous impression among
some students and even among
members of the Faculty who
are not familiar with the purpose
of the meetings or who have mis
interpreted the spirit in which the}'
are called. There will be no
"rough-house." Everything will
move forward in a dignified and
judicious manner. It is the pro
moters' intention to arouse college
enthusiasm, not by momentary
excitement, but by bringing stu
dents and faculty in touch with
each other through the discussion
before the student body of those
problems in which every lover of
Stanford should be interested.
