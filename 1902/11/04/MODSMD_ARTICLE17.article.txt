There can be little boisterous
exultation in the attitude with
which the University receives the
announcement that the Smith con
troversy is finally settled; with
every contested point decided
squarely in Stanford's favor. The
California half-back's reputation
as an athlete and sportsman has
been of such a nature among even
his opponents as to admit of no
jubilation over circumstances which
have brought his career on the
gridiron to an abrupt and unfor
tunate close. Rather it must be
regretted that so unpleasant an
episode, however happy the cul
mination from a Cardinal stand
point, should have been brought to
an issue on the eve of a contest
into which no factor should enter
save that of healthy intercollegiate
rivalry. But passing the personal
phases of the episode, it can
not be denied that there is
much in the ruling of the nine

teen impartial gentlemen of the
University Club to engender a feel
ing of deep satisfaction. For the
moment the decision on the Smith
case will overshadow all else, for it
is what we have been looking for
ward to with keen expectation.
But it is really of casual import
ance beside the fact that it has
been established once and for all
what the status of the Pacific Ath
letic Association shall be in ques
tions of intercollegiate importance.
It was only by a curious chance
that this matter was considered at
all, it having been injected into the
Smith case with entire irrelevance
by Manager Decoto of California.
But the matter was brought up, and
the decision means that in the
future California will not be able
to avoid searching inquiry by sub
mitting cases like those of Smith
and Overall to the P. A. A. Had
everythingelse been decided against
us, the resolution of Saturday would
in itself have made the efforts of
Dr. Angell and the other men who
presented the case of Stanford emi
nently worth while.
