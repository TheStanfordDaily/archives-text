# President Dittmar Explains.
## 
### 
At the lust rally of the Palo Alto
Democratic campaign, held last
evening, C. F. Dittmar, '03, and
F. E. Nangle, '03, gave short ad
dresses. Dittmar took occasion to
say that he was making his maiden
political speech, notwithstanding
the report that he had been stump
ing the various parts of the state,
using his college ollice to that end.
"As a matter of fact," he said, "1
have been engaged in other busi
ness. If I had had the time and
inclination, I most certainly would
not have let the fact of my being
student body president keep me
from publicly expressing my polit
ical sentiments. For 1 believe it to
be the duty of every college man to
have ideas on politics and to be
ready to express himself when oc
casion demands. I have not come
to my political convictions through
heredity. My people, with one ex
ception, were all Republicans. But
1 have my convictions and propose
to stand by them."
