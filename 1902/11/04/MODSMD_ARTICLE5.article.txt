The Varsity squad is working
twice a day now for the last week
before the big game. Every morn
ing for an hour and a half signal
work is drilled into the candidates;
every evening there is more signal
work, and a hard scrimmage. The
physical condition of the squad is
good, except that there are several
men who have severe colds. Those
of the men who were suffering from
more severe injuries have rounded
into shape. McGilvray will proba
bly do the punting, as his leg is in
good shape again. Magee's ribs
have mended, and he is doing
scrimmage work. Clark will not
line up before the game, but his
knee is getting stronger every day.
There are none of the little sprains
and bruises in the squad which
prove so troublesome for those
about to engage in a big struggle.
