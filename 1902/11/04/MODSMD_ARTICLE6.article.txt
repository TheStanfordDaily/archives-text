There hns been a feeling for Home
years that, Stanford and California
should adopt as an intercollegiate
tradition "To the victor belongs the

field." Last semester the execu
tive of the two student bodies left
matters in the hands of the Faculty
Athletic Committee. In the joint
meeting last September Dr. Angell
and Colonel Edwards decided to
adopt the rule as above stated, the
partisans of the defeated team to
remain on the bleachers until the
field is cleared.
While Stanford and California
have never had a very serious mix
up after the intercollegiate meets,
yet many little affairs which could
with profit be eliminated have in
the past been quite frequent.
