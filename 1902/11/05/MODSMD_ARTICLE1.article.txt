# UNIVERSITY MEETING.
## Entire College Heard President Jordan and Dr. Farrand in Assembly Hall. 
### 
The first University meeting at
Stanford took plack this morning
in Assembly Hall. Students
crowded in from every quarter of
the campus and filled the hall. The
first number on the program was
the song "Down with California,"
sung by the whole audience and
led by 11. I'. Kuhn and Cleveland
Baker. Then the Stanford yell
rang out. "The Best Company"
followed, and President Jordan
spoke of the purpose of these bi
weekly meetings and the elements
of college spirit. He said, in part:
"These meetings are to be held in
future so that all the students may
come elbow to elbow, that the
President and Faculty may have
an opportunity to reach the stu
dents, and that Stanford may
afford an audience to worthy men.
It will be a success under two con
ditions —if you all come, and if the
committee brings worthy things be
fore you. In the early days, dur
ing the first years of the University,
there was a very democratic body
here. All lived in Encina, all
were of one family. The first foot
ball victory was also a social vic
tory. Now there is a growth of the
spirit of specialization, and the ele
ments of division are many—the
growth in number of students, fra
ternities, societies, athletics—some
of which are making for the lessen
ing of college spirit.
"College spirit is a keen interest
in everything that concerns the
college and its members, loyalty to
fellow students, to the founders, to
its reputation,and loyalty to right.
It is a disposition to help, and
when anything goes wrong to turn
in and make it right, a disposition
never to disgrace Alma Mater.
"There is a difference between
college spirit and university spirit.
The college spirit helps the univer
sity, lends it force, blood, enthusi
asm; the university spirit helps
the college, lends it brains, charac
ter, direction; and the ideal future
spirit is a union of the two.
"College spirit is injured by all
that disintegrates, disgusts, or dis
graces, by bad taste, by dissipation,
by the wrong spirit in athletics, by
snobbishness, by lack of self-re
spect, by agitation against any of
the avowed policies of the institu
tion. Agitation here against co
education is unpatriotic. You may
have your opinion and speak your
mind; but to agitate, to try to make
co-education uncomfortable, is to
injure the University. Youshould
show your college spirit by being
loyal to each other, to the founder,
to the Stanford achievement, and
to the eternal principle of right
which Stanford strives to make
real."
President Dittmarofthe student
body, following Dr. Jordan's ad
dress, spoke of the preparation for
tomorrow night's rally in Assembly
Hall. The Glee Club sang "Hail,
Stanford, Hail." Prof. Max Far
land, head of the History depart
ment, then spoke in straightfor
ward terms of some of the more
practical phases of college spirit,

his words calling forth enthusiastic
applause again and again. The
trend of his remarks was as follows:
"Among all the factors of college
spirit sympathy is the greatest, and
the sympathy bred in college days
is to be looked upon as of no small
good. If you get from your college
only what is given you in the class
room you have missed the biggest
and best part of what your college
might have given you.
"Here at Stanford the greatest
thing that 1 have missed is a defi
nite college spirit. A few weeks
ago 1 spoke to some such effect
at Berkeley, and afterward a Cal
ifornia man said to me, 'You
gave it to us hard, but we deserve
every word of it. All we ask is
that you give it as hard to Stan
ford when you get a chance.' And
I'm going to do it. There is per
haps a good reason for the lack of
unification here. You are the
progeny of generations of pioneers,
and the individualism brought
about by Western life is the cause
of this lack of unified spirit. The
freedom and elbow-room of the
West is decidedly refreshing, but
it has its disadvantages. Last
year, for instance, I saw a number
of Stanford students leaving the
football field before the result of
the game was absolutely sure, and
not staying to support the team to
the very last. In the East, a man
doing such a thing would be ostra
cised, and that at once.
"Another thing in which the
spirit here is wrong is about the
college periodicals. In the Eastern
colleges every student subscribes to
every college publication, and it
becomes the highest honor to be a
member of the staff,or to even have
a contribution accepted. The de
mand upon students here is very
small, and each student ought to
lay aside enough at the beginning
of the year to support the college
interests. It is all wrong when
there is only one of each of the
periodicals for each fraternity—
every member ought to take one.
Give your moral as well as finan
cial support to the papers, to the
Y. M. C. A., and to each and every
student interest.
"The way to develop college
spirit is to get together, liut rallies
ought to be needless to foster en
thusiasm, that ought to be there
already."
