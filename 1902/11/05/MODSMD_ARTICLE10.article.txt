Probably few of us —new stu
dents especially—had an adequate
conception of the size and power of
the Stanford student body until it
was brought together in mass
meeting this morning. Comment
on the University Assembly,beyond
a mere report of it, is unnecessary.
Its success has been assured since
the first announcement. Novem
ber 5, 1902, will go down in
Stanford history as the beginning
of a feeling of fellowship among
the students, and a sentiment of
loyalty and mutual interest, des
tined to be the strongest charac
teristic in the life of the institu
tion. As the day becomes a his
torical milestone, so will the ad
dresses of President Jordan and of
Dr. Farrand take place as the most
potent factors in making it
so. Any person who heard
the cheering and singing today,
and who did not have every
ember of sentiment fanned by the
addresses into a flame of whole
some, robust, unselfish loyalty, is
not worthy to be a Stanford man
or woman.
