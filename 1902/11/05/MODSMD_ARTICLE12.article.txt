# "Chaparral" Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The football issue of the Chapar
ral, which will appear tomorrow,
contains for its leading feature a
double-page football drawing by R.
W. Borough. The artist has made
it a study in interference, showing
a Stanford back going through the
line protected by an unyielding wall
of team-mates. In portraying the
action of the scrimmage it succeeds,
which is a thing that can be said of
few football pictures.
The verse is far above the usual
standard,"The Stanford Red," by
Chas. K. Field, and "Graduates by
Request," by Wallace Irwin, being
the leading features.
