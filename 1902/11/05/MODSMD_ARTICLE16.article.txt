Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In the meeting this morning,
President Jordan had occasion to
refer to the class of students who
by their bad taste and lack of tact
in speaking at public meetings
misrepresent the University and
embarrass its management. He
added that lie referred to no one
in particular and that no illustra
tion was necessary. Immediately
following his remark the president
of the student body in announcing
the football rally for Friday even
ing said: "The men of the Univer
sity will occupy the lower floor of
the Assembly Hall. The co-eds
are assigned to the gallery."
As Dr. Jordan had but a moment
before stated that in Stanford Uni
versity men and women are ac
cepted upon terms of absolute
equality, and in announcing the
students' convention had said that
the women of the University were
welcome to any seat in the house,
President Dittmar, in my opinion,
showed a grave lack of courtesy, in
his announcement. He also ex
ceeded his authority in assigning
the women students to the galleries.
The women of the University,
moreover, are never referred to,
either in public meeting or in col
lege papers, as "co-eds," and the
term is distasteful to the student
body as a whole.
President Dittmar should have
said: "As it is desirable to have
the yelling section in compact mass,
the men of the University will es
teem it a favor if the women of the
University will allow them the use
of the lower floor." An exact
statement of fact is not inconsistent
with perfect courtesy, and we shall
never have the ideal college spirit
until we attain to a full recogni
tion of other people's rights.
