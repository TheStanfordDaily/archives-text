						New Stanford Song.

### 
A new Stanford song lias been
written by Chae. K. Field, 'H5, the
author of "Four Leaved Clover,"
and joint-author of Stanford
Stories. The new song, "The Stan
ford Red," in its original form was
an almost extemporaneous effort
of Mr. Field's at the recent alumni
banquet in San Francisco. The
Chaparral secured a copy, but on
asking Mr. Field's permission to
publish it met with a refusal on
the ground that it was only the
trifle of a moment's thought and
not intended fcr publication. In
sistence for permission to print it
led to its being revised and worked
into a completed form to lit.the
tune of "Gypsy John." Feeling
confident that the song will take
rank among the best of Stanford's
lyrics, the Chaparral has had it
published, with the music, and will
have it placed on sale during the
latter part of the week. To regular
subscribers it will be furnished
free.
