# RALLY TOMORROW NIGHT.
## The 						Final Jolly-up Before the Game Will be Held in the Assembly Hall. 
### 
Tomorrow night in Assembly
Hall will be held the annual foot
ball rally and send-off to the team.
The occasion will mark the culmi
nation of the season's rooting
practice. The football and the
college songs will be sung, and
the familiar yells turned loose
with all the spirited enthusiasm
which has characterized the season.
As usual, the coaches, trainer,
manager, captain, and players will
figure prominently. Dr. Jordan
has promised to be present and ad
dress the team. Dr. Angell, who
has largely directed Stanford's pol
icy in the Smith controversy, will
make some remarks which every
Stanford enthusiast will be glad to
hear. Dr. Max Farrand, who for a
number of years was closely con
nected with athletic affairs at
Princeton, will follow up his talk
today on "College Spirit" with some
well-directed observations.
The Band will accompany the
singing. Yell-leader Kuhn and
song-leader Baker have asked that
every rooter who has not already
done so make himself familiar with
the songs.
The Executive Committee has
arranged that shortly before the
rally,which is set for 7:30 o'clock,a
procession will start from Encina,
and others from the fraternity
houses on the row. Directly after
the Assembly Hall exercises a mon
ster bonfire will be started on the
baseball field, and a hoodoo will be
burned "in honor of the game."
