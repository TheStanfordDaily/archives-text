At the close of the game with
Reliance hist Saturday the condi
tion of the Stanford Varsity was
decidedly encouraging to the Car
dinal sympathizers. With the be
ginning of secret practice a new set
of signals was adopted by the
coaches, and as a consequence the
team was placed in a verji embar
rassing position. But the confusion
produced by the introduction of the
new numbers has been overcome to
some extent of late. By holding
signal-work for nearly three hours
a day the men have become fairly
familiar with the new set. The
backs no longer start for the line
when the quarter calls for an end
run, although mix-ups are too fre
quent for comfort. The coaches
are working morning and night
with the squad, and hope to round
the eleven into shape by Saturday.
There have been several addi
tions to the coaching department
during the last week. Besides
Clemens and Slaker, who have
been aided throughout the season
by Professor Lewers, Chester Mur
phy, '00, and Spalding, who
coached the team last year, have
been hard at work. Major Collins,
military instructor at Belmont
School, has been up several times
to lend a hand. Clemens has de
voted his attention almost exclu
sively to the tackles, McFadden
and Sprott. Slaker is working
back of the line. Murphy has had
charge of the punting and place
kicking, and has given especial at

tention to the work of the quarter
back. He was one of the strongest
punters Stanford ever had, and is
working hard with Magee and Me-
Gilvray to perfect a man who can
effectually meet Overall's long
punts. Spalding, Major Collins,
and Professor Lewers have all been
devoting most of their attention to
the line, where Stanford is most
liable to need her strength on Sat
urday.
About trick plays or new forma
tions the captain had nothing to
say today, but declared that Stan
ford would rely on straight football
almost entirely.
Much attention has been devoted
to place-kicking. Sprott, McFad
den, Magee, and Dole have each
been tried, with more or less suc
cess. No one of them, however,
has shown up very much better
than the others, and the man who
will do the kicking for Stanford
has not yet been definitely chosen.
The secret practice will continue
until the day of the game.
