A marine view, the second of the
pictures presented by Mr. Charles
G. Lathrop to the Museum, has
just been hung. The two scenes of
early California life, by Charles
Nahl, which were for many years
in the State Capitol at Sacramento,
have been changed from the south
art gallery to the one on the north.
Several new documents and pa
pers have been added to the inter
esting and valuable collection of
manuscripts and ancient books in
the cases in the gallery in the main
hall. There is a copy of the Daily
Alta California, issued on Sept. 21,
1852, a gift of Mrs. Charles G.
Lathrop. There are several bills
of sale of slave girls, dated in the
early fifties. An edition of the
Palo Alto Times printed at the
time the decision was given in Mrs.
Stanford's favor in the matter of
the U. S. vs. Mrs. Jane L.Stanford.
The edition is printed in cardinal,
and large heads declare the unan
imous decision in Mrs. Stanford's
favor. Mr. B. F. Hall of Palo Alto
is the donor. There is a letters
patent of Queen Victoria, issued in
1868. The specimen is curious and
rare. The donor is unknown.
