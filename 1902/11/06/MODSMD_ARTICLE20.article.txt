It has been suggested that every
man who expects to be in the root
ing section on Saturday —and that
means every man in college—be
urged to learn thewords of the songs.
The suggestion is timely and can
not too soon be followed. The
singing at the University Assembly
yesterday demonstrated that with
out our song-books most of us are
helpless. Yet we cannot all expect
to carry them to the game. And
besides the only effective singing is
that which comes from knowing
every word of every verse by
heart. What little exertion is
necessary in order to catch the
words of a football song must be
made if we hope to vie with Cali
fornia on the bleachers.
