While every feature of student
activity outside the classroom is for
the moment subordinated to the
match of Saturday, it must not he
forgotten that this week marks in
another field of endeavor the he
ginning of a struggle in whose cul

mination the University is even
more vitally concerned than that
of the football contest. In a wiiy,
it is unfortunate that the Carnot
preliminaries should have come at
this time. But it is also a source of
satisfaction to know that the de
baters have commenced work so
early that adequate preparation is
assured. We would plead for a
more general attendance at these
preliminaries. Worth hearing for
themselves, they are doubly so in
view of the fact that every man
and woman in the audience is a
source of direct encouragement to
the speakers. The grind that pre
cedes an Intercollegiate debate is
not spectacular. It is lonely, up
hill work, to whose effectiveness
every evidence of appreciation di
rectly contributes. A mere hand
ful heard the speakers last night;
tomorrow evening should find the
chapel crowded.
