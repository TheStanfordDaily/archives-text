# "Chappie" Outdoes Himself.
## 
### 
The Chaparral is out today with
an excellent number. The verse
has already been mentioned as the
best of the year, and the art work
is of the usual standard. The
double-page drawing by Borough
is of a higher order than has yet
appeared. The editorials are
strong, although the implied criti
cism of the Y. M. C. A. is ill-timed
in view of the fact that that insti
tution has consistently confined
itself to its own field for some time
past.
