# Football "Sequoia" Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The first Sequoia of this month
will appear tomorrow, a week
ahead of the scheduled date, so .as
to come before the big game. It is
a football number and contains
much that is readable as pre-inter
collegiate matter. The editorials
are in the nature of a prediction
and contain what ought to be the
final word upon the Smith case.
A review of the season's work on
the gridiron and an appreciation of
the labors of those who have
helped appears under the title "The
Season's Work," by A. A. Hamp
son, who has reported football
through the fall for the Daily Palo
Alto. The leading story of the
issue is "For the Sake of Stanford,"
by T. E. Stephenson. Alice Aileen
Higgins has a clever story entitled
"Hut for the Chinaman." Verse is
contributed by Eratnos the, nom <le
plume of a new Stanford writer of
prominence, Tom Hodge, and Hal
lett Abend. A good Sketch Book
completes the issue.
