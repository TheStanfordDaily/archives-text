# California Team Chosen.
## 
### 
At the final hard practice of the
year the eleven men who will face
Stanford Saturday afternoon were
chosen. The places were practi
cally won by the men who will fill
them two weeks ago, with the ex
ception of the vacancy at half left
by the forced withdrawal of Smith.
Hudson and Demeritt will play at
ends, Captain Albertson and Heit
muller at tackle, Stow and Overall
at guard, Stroud at center, More at
quarter-back, and behind the line
Sherman and Mini at halves, with
Whipple at full. The team is
strong on defense,and has a heavier
line than Stanford, but is lacking
in a back who can be relied upon
to buck the line. The substitutes
present a wide field from which to
draw, and California need have lit
tle cause for alarm should any
man be injured, as there is one
nearly as good waiting to take his
place.
