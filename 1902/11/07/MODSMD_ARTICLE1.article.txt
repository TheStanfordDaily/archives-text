# LAST NIGHT'S BALLY.
## Genuine Enthusiasm Marked the Monster Meeting in Assembly Hall. 
### 
The "Stanford spirit," which
some of the alumni have mourned
;i8 a thing of the past, was wonder
fully in evidence at the final send
off to the Varsity and substitutes,
held in Assembly Hall last even
ing. Enthusiasm ran wild. Yells
and songs were voiced with a vim
that gave every man on the squad
assurance that the students, men
and women alike, were with them
win or lose. The cheering was
leu by H. P. Kuhn, '03, and the
singing by Cleveland Baker, '04.
President Dittmar presided.
The crowd gathered at 8 o'clock,
the men marching into the hall in
two great squads. The gallery was
already filled with the women cf
the University, whose loyalty was
quite as much in evidence,although
less violently expressed. The pro
gram was opened with a swinging
march by the University Band, and
a song by the rooters. Then Pres
ident Jordan gave a short address.
He expressed the necessity of win
ning by clean, honest playing, and
assured the men of his hearty sup
port. He also plead for a sense of
individual responsibility on the
part of the students. The Stanford
name, he said, they took with them
wherever they went, and it was im
perative that the name should be
kept clear of reproach.
Dr. Stillman was called upon,
and said that although a graduate
of California, and a sympathizer
with Berkeley's interests, he was
with Stanford to the last, and was
hopeful of a victory.
Professor Lewers, comparing the
Varsity with teams of former years,
said that the Cardinal undoubtedly
has a faster team, and he thought
a better team than ever before.
Dole he characterized as "one of
the greatest half-backs this Coast
has ever seen."
The Band played at intervals
throughout the evening and ac
companied the singing. Develine
whistles arrived during the proceed
ings, and added greatly to the
effectiveness of the "sky-rocket"
yell.
Coaches Clemens, Slaker, and
Murphy responded to the calls of
the rooters, and their remarks were
received with rousing cheers. Clem
ens spoke at some length, reviewing
the season's work, and paying par
ticular attention to the Smith inci
dent. Slaker commended the work
of the Second team, and expressed
confidence in the Varsity's ability
to acquit itself creditably.
Captain Lee and members of the
team when called upon showed
that, while not over-confident, they
were determined to fight and to
win.
Leaving the Assembly Hall the
crowd, led by the Band, marched
about the quad in serpentine forma
tion, and then proceeded to the
baseball field. A huge bonfire had
been provided by the freshmen,and
circling about this the rooters gave
vent to their feelings without re
straint. The gathering finally dis
persed late in the evening when the
fire had burned low.
