# Field Belongs to Winner.

### 
In view of the fact (1) that the
rallies on the football Held immedi
ately following the big game have
developed into things more serious,
and have several times taken on
the form of actual scrimmage, and
(2) that there have been indica
tions that the conditions will be
intensified tomorrow, the Executive
Committee have adopted the follow
ing resolution:
Resolved, That it is the sense of
the Executive Committee that in
the event of the opposing team
winning the big game Saturday,
our students should in no way
harass or interfere with their un
molested occupation of the football
field after the game.
It is understood that Berkeley is
taking the same action, and thus
all friction between the student
forces is assured of being obviated.
