California rooters held their an
nual smoker in Harmon Gymna
sium last evening. Speeches by
coaches and alumni, and singing
of football songs, were the order of
the evening. Dr. George C. l'ardee,
governor elect, who was invited to
the meeting, was unable to appear,

but sent a telegram with the mess
age, "I wish I could be with you
tonight. We must beat Stanford.
Upon the team rests California's
honor. Remember 'Locomotive'
Smith and win." This met the
entire approval of the crowd, and
"Remember 'Locomotive' Smith"
was the sentiment of every speech
that followed. Warren Smith ex
pressed the hope that the team
would "make such a fight that the
Stanford men will have to carry
every one of their eleven men off
the field," and the rooters cheered
until exhausted.
