The line-up of the two elevens
has been definitely settled. The
Stanford coaches announced the
names of the men who will face
California in the first half, early
this afternoon. The names and

The scores made by California
and Stanford during this season
are decidedly in the favor of the
State University. California's total
score is one hundred and twenty
two points to none for her adver
saries; while Stanford has been
able to pile up only eighty-two
points, while both Nevada and Re
liance made one field goal against
her. The list of games follows:

With the team chosen, the last
practice finished, and the Intercol
legiate gatne less than twenty
hours in the future, Stanford's
chances are brighter and her out
look more hopeful than at any
time before during this season.
The Varsity eleven is in many
respects one of the best that ever
bore the Cardinal against the Gold
and Blue. Its greatest shortcom
ing is found in its lack of experi
ence. In last year's Intercollegiate
there played only five of the eleven
men who will meet Stanford's rival
tomorrow. The three center men,
Hauverman, Captain Lee, and
Barnhisel,are old Varsity men and
all know the game from start to
.finish. Against this trio California
opposes Overall, Stroud, and Stow.

Overall, the Berkeley giant, has
been playing the game of his life
this season, but when he faces Lee
tomorrow he will play against a
man who in knowledge of the game
and ability to play is fully his
peer. Hauverman at center, al
though outweighed twenty-two
pounds, is the superior of his op
ponent in football ability. Barn
hisel can hold his own against Stow
and still be able to help McFadden
in his struggle with Captain Albert
son. At the other tackle Heit
muller, California's weakest man,
will play against the agile fresh
man. Sprott has had little football
experience 1 but has indicated
throughout the season that his
nerve is fine and that his head is
cool. The four ends are about

equal in ability, experience, and
weight. Clark probably is the best
of the quartette, but his superiority
over Hudson of California is
very slight.
In the back field the advantage
lies with the Cardinal. Bansbach
at quarter is the admitted superior
of More in generalship, although
his slight weight deprives him of
much value in backing up the line.
In ability to direct the plays and
power to hold the team together he
is invaluable. McGilvray at full
back is a sure ground gainer, but
Whipple of California is a slash
ing back. Mini at right half on
Berkeley eleven is a speedy back.
He is, perhaps, quicker on his feet
and more to be feared on end runs
than any man in either back-field.
Sherman, who was chosen to take
Smith's place, plays much the
same style of game that Mini does.
Dole and Tarpey are a stronger
pair than their opponents. Dole
is a careful, conscientious player
who rarely fails to gain his yards
on straight line bucking. Tarpey
is a wonder at following his inter
ference and is an extremely difficult
man to down when tackled. Indi
vidually Stanford compares favor
ably with California; as a team she
is perhaps stronger.
The Stanford eleven has de
veloped wonderfully in unity and
team-work during the last two
weeks. Its defense is probably su
perior to that of its rival. In of
fensive work it is not so strong.
The chief reliance of the Cardinal
will be in putting up an invulner
able defense to the onslaughts of
California on her line. In punting
Overall is the superior of McGil-
vray, who will kick for {Stanford.
The game is sure to be close,neither
having much the advantage of the
other. The score depends almost
entirely upon the spirit with which
the men play. If the Stanford
eleven starts the game with a dash
it will be victorious by a narrow
margin. Should Berkeley get the
jump victory will be hers.
OPINIONS OF THE COACHES.
Head-Coach Clemens would not
venture an opinion as to the score
but regarded Stanford's chances of
victory as more than fair. He said
that he did not underestimate the
California ability but felt he had
coached a winning team.
Slaker said that the difficulties
under which Stanford found her
self at the beginning of the season
had been overcome. The Varsity
eleven he regards as one of the best
Stanford ever sent on the field and
its chances of victory as even.
"Should the men play the game
they know with a fighting spirit,"
he said, "I have no fear as to the
outcome."
Chester Murphy refused to
prophesy a victory but said that
Stanford's chances were good. "I
believe that we are going to win,"
he concluded, "if the men play
football as I feel that they can and
will."
Professor Lewers regards Stan
ford's chances as Blightly better
than those of Berkeley. The men
know the game and have good
spirit, and win or lose are sure to
put up a game of which every
Stanford man should be proud.
TRAINEH AND CAPTAIN.
"Dad'' Moulton, who has trained
his men carefully and well through
out the season, announced the ter
mination of his task with the sat
isfactory statement that the men
were in good physical condition for
the big game. Clark's knee is in
good shape and with reasonable
luck should not trouble him during
the game. McFadden, who was
laid up with a cold last week, is
now in good shape,and McGilvray's
leg is no longer troublesome. The
other men are in the pink of con
dition and should last the game
with no difficulty that faithful,
careful training on their part could
remedy.
Captain Lee expressed himself
as satisfied with the condition of
the men and regarded Stanford's
chance of victory as good. "If we

play the game with some fight in us
we will pull out all right," he said.
Stanford should win by a email
score, he thought.
SUBSTITUTES.
Should any of the Cardinal
players he hurt there will be men
on the side-lines who are competent
to step into the vacant places.
Kennedy, who played on his Fresh
man team in 1900, is first substi
tute for the full-back's position.
"Pie" Smith, who has played in
three intercollegiate games, will be
the first man in at half-back. He
is a good man to carry the ball but
is not over strong in defensive
work. At tackle "Guiby" Dole is
nearly the equal of Sprott, and will
be the first man to go in should
either the Freshman or McFadden
be injured. Jacobs, who has been
playing a strong game at guard
throughout the season on the Sec
ond team, is the first substitute for
the position of guard. Magee, cap
tain of this year's Freshman team,
will step in at end should Clark or
Bartell be forced to retire from the
con test.

The scores made by California
and Stanford during this season
are decidedly in the favor of the
State University. California's total
score is one hundred and twenty
two points to none for her adver
saries; while Stanford has been
able to pile up only eighty-two
points, while both Nevada and Re
liance made one field goal against
her. The list of games follows:

With the team chosen, the last
practice finished, and the Intercol
legiate gatne less than twenty
hours in the future, Stanford's
chances are brighter and her out
look more hopeful than at any
time before during this season.
The Varsity eleven is in many
respects one of the best that ever
bore the Cardinal against the Gold
and Blue. Its greatest shortcom
ing is found in its lack of experi
ence. In last year's Intercollegiate
there played only five of the eleven
men who will meet Stanford's rival
tomorrow. The three center men,
Hauverman, Captain Lee, and
Barnhisel,are old Varsity men and
all know the game from start to
.finish. Against this trio California
opposes Overall, Stroud, and Stow.

Overall, the Berkeley giant, has
been playing the game of his life
this season, but when he faces Lee
tomorrow he will play against a
man who in knowledge of the game
and ability to play is fully his
peer. Hauverman at center, al
though outweighed twenty-two
pounds, is the superior of his op
ponent in football ability. Barn
hisel can hold his own against Stow
and still be able to help McFadden
in his struggle with Captain Albert
son. At the other tackle Heit
muller, California's weakest man,
will play against the agile fresh
man. Sprott has had little football
experience 1 but has indicated
throughout the season that his
nerve is fine and that his head is
cool. The four ends are about

equal in ability, experience, and
weight. Clark probably is the best
of the quartette, but his superiority
over Hudson of California is
very slight.
In the back field the advantage
lies with the Cardinal. Bansbach
at quarter is the admitted superior
of More in generalship, although
his slight weight deprives him of
much value in backing up the line.
In ability to direct the plays and
power to hold the team together he
is invaluable. McGilvray at full
back is a sure ground gainer, but
Whipple of California is a slash
ing back. Mini at right half on
Berkeley eleven is a speedy back.
He is, perhaps, quicker on his feet
and more to be feared on end runs
than any man in either back-field.
Sherman, who was chosen to take
Smith's place, plays much the
same style of game that Mini does.
Dole and Tarpey are a stronger
pair than their opponents. Dole
is a careful, conscientious player
who rarely fails to gain his yards
on straight line bucking. Tarpey
is a wonder at following his inter
ference and is an extremely difficult
man to down when tackled. Indi
vidually Stanford compares favor
ably with California; as a team she
is perhaps stronger.
The Stanford eleven has de
veloped wonderfully in unity and
team-work during the last two
weeks. Its defense is probably su
perior to that of its rival. In of
fensive work it is not so strong.
The chief reliance of the Cardinal
will be in putting up an invulner
able defense to the onslaughts of
California on her line. In punting
Overall is the superior of McGil-
vray, who will kick for {Stanford.
The game is sure to be close,neither
having much the advantage of the
other. The score depends almost
entirely upon the spirit with which
the men play. If the Stanford
eleven starts the game with a dash
it will be victorious by a narrow
margin. Should Berkeley get the
jump victory will be hers.
OPINIONS OF THE COACHES.
Head-Coach Clemens would not
venture an opinion as to the score
but regarded Stanford's chances of
victory as more than fair. He said
that he did not underestimate the
California ability but felt he had
coached a winning team.
Slaker said that the difficulties
under which Stanford found her
self at the beginning of the season
had been overcome. The Varsity
eleven he regards as one of the best
Stanford ever sent on the field and
its chances of victory as even.
"Should the men play the game
they know with a fighting spirit,"
he said, "I have no fear as to the
outcome."
Chester Murphy refused to
prophesy a victory but said that
Stanford's chances were good. "I
believe that we are going to win,"
he concluded, "if the men play
football as I feel that they can and
will."
Professor Lewers regards Stan
ford's chances as Blightly better
than those of Berkeley. The men
know the game and have good
spirit, and win or lose are sure to
put up a game of which every
Stanford man should be proud.
TRAINEH AND CAPTAIN.
"Dad'' Moulton, who has trained
his men carefully and well through
out the season, announced the ter
mination of his task with the sat
isfactory statement that the men
were in good physical condition for
the big game. Clark's knee is in
good shape and with reasonable
luck should not trouble him during
the game. McFadden, who was
laid up with a cold last week, is
now in good shape,and McGilvray's
leg is no longer troublesome. The
other men are in the pink of con
dition and should last the game
with no difficulty that faithful,
careful training on their part could
remedy.
Captain Lee expressed himself
as satisfied with the condition of
the men and regarded Stanford's
chance of victory as good. "If we

play the game with some fight in us
we will pull out all right," he said.
Stanford should win by a email
score, he thought.
SUBSTITUTES.
Should any of the Cardinal
players he hurt there will be men
on the side-lines who are competent
to step into the vacant places.
Kennedy, who played on his Fresh
man team in 1900, is first substi
tute for the full-back's position.
"Pie" Smith, who has played in
three intercollegiate games, will be
the first man in at half-back. He
is a good man to carry the ball but
is not over strong in defensive
work. At tackle "Guiby" Dole is
nearly the equal of Sprott, and will
be the first man to go in should
either the Freshman or McFadden
be injured. Jacobs, who has been
playing a strong game at guard
throughout the season on the Sec
ond team, is the first substitute for
the position of guard. Magee, cap
tain of this year's Freshman team,
will step in at end should Clark or
Bartell be forced to retire from the
con test.

though outweighed twenty-two
pounds, is the superior of his op
ponent in football ability. Barn
hisel can hold his own against Stow
and still be able to help McFadden
in his struggle with Captain Albert
son. At the other tackle Heit
muller, California's weakest man,
will play against the agile fresh
man. Sprott has had little football
experience 1 but has indicated
throughout the season that his
nerve is fine and that his head is
cool. The four ends are about

equal in ability, experience, and
weight. Clark probably is the best
of the quartette, but his superiority
over Hudson of California is
very slight.
In the back field the advantage
lies with the Cardinal. Bansbach
at quarter is the admitted superior
of More in generalship, although
his slight weight deprives him of
much value in backing up the line.
In ability to direct the plays and
power to hold the team together he
is invaluable. McGilvray at full
back is a sure ground gainer, but
Whipple of California is a slash
ing back. Mini at right half on
Berkeley eleven is a speedy back.
He is, perhaps, quicker on his feet
and more to be feared on end runs
than any man in either back-field.
Sherman, who was chosen to take
Smith's place, plays much the
same style of game that Mini does.
Dole and Tarpey are a stronger
pair than their opponents. Dole
is a careful, conscientious player
who rarely fails to gain his yards
on straight line bucking. Tarpey
is a wonder at following his inter
ference and is an extremely difficult
man to down when tackled. Indi
vidually Stanford compares favor
ably with California; as a team she
is perhaps stronger.
The Stanford eleven has de
veloped wonderfully in unity and
team-work during the last two
weeks. Its defense is probably su
perior to that of its rival. In of
fensive work it is not so strong.
The chief reliance of the Cardinal
will be in putting up an invulner
able defense to the onslaughts of
California on her line. In punting
Overall is the superior of McGil-
vray, who will kick for {Stanford.
The game is sure to be close,neither
having much the advantage of the
other. The score depends almost
entirely upon the spirit with which
the men play. If the Stanford
eleven starts the game with a dash
it will be victorious by a narrow
margin. Should Berkeley get the
jump victory will be hers.
OPINIONS OF THE COACHES.
Head-Coach Clemens would not
venture an opinion as to the score
but regarded Stanford's chances of
victory as more than fair. He said
that he did not underestimate the
California ability but felt he had
coached a winning team.
Slaker said that the difficulties
under which Stanford found her
self at the beginning of the season
had been overcome. The Varsity
eleven he regards as one of the best
Stanford ever sent on the field and
its chances of victory as even.
"Should the men play the game
they know with a fighting spirit,"
he said, "I have no fear as to the
outcome."
Chester Murphy refused to
prophesy a victory but said that
Stanford's chances were good. "I
believe that we are going to win,"
he concluded, "if the men play
football as I feel that they can and
will."
Professor Lewers regards Stan
ford's chances as Blightly better
than those of Berkeley. The men
know the game and have good
spirit, and win or lose are sure to
put up a game of which every
Stanford man should be proud.
TRAINEH AND CAPTAIN.
"Dad'' Moulton, who has trained
his men carefully and well through
out the season, announced the ter
mination of his task with the sat
isfactory statement that the men
were in good physical condition for
the big game. Clark's knee is in
good shape and with reasonable
luck should not trouble him during
the game. McFadden, who was
laid up with a cold last week, is
now in good shape,and McGilvray's
leg is no longer troublesome. The
other men are in the pink of con
dition and should last the game
with no difficulty that faithful,
careful training on their part could
remedy.
Captain Lee expressed himself
as satisfied with the condition of
the men and regarded Stanford's
chance of victory as good. "If we

play the game with some fight in us
we will pull out all right," he said.
Stanford should win by a email
score, he thought.
SUBSTITUTES.
Should any of the Cardinal
players he hurt there will be men
on the side-lines who are competent
to step into the vacant places.
Kennedy, who played on his Fresh
man team in 1900, is first substi
tute for the full-back's position.
"Pie" Smith, who has played in
three intercollegiate games, will be
the first man in at half-back. He
is a good man to carry the ball but
is not over strong in defensive
work. At tackle "Guiby" Dole is
nearly the equal of Sprott, and will
be the first man to go in should
either the Freshman or McFadden
be injured. Jacobs, who has been
playing a strong game at guard
throughout the season on the Sec
ond team, is the first substitute for
the position of guard. Magee, cap
tain of this year's Freshman team,
will step in at end should Clark or
Bartell be forced to retire from the
con test.

The scores made by California
and Stanford during this season
are decidedly in the favor of the
State University. California's total
score is one hundred and twenty
two points to none for her adver
saries; while Stanford has been
able to pile up only eighty-two
points, while both Nevada and Re
liance made one field goal against
her. The list of games follows:

With the team chosen, the last
practice finished, and the Intercol
legiate gatne less than twenty
hours in the future, Stanford's
chances are brighter and her out
look more hopeful than at any
time before during this season.
The Varsity eleven is in many
respects one of the best that ever
bore the Cardinal against the Gold
and Blue. Its greatest shortcom
ing is found in its lack of experi
ence. In last year's Intercollegiate
there played only five of the eleven
men who will meet Stanford's rival
tomorrow. The three center men,
Hauverman, Captain Lee, and
Barnhisel,are old Varsity men and
all know the game from start to
.finish. Against this trio California
opposes Overall, Stroud, and Stow.

Overall, the Berkeley giant, has
been playing the game of his life
this season, but when he faces Lee
tomorrow he will play against a
man who in knowledge of the game
and ability to play is fully his
peer. Hauverman at center, al
though outweighed twenty-two
pounds, is the superior of his op
ponent in football ability. Barn
hisel can hold his own against Stow
and still be able to help McFadden
in his struggle with Captain Albert
son. At the other tackle Heit
muller, California's weakest man,
will play against the agile fresh
man. Sprott has had little football
