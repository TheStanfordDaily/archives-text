The scores made by California
and Stanford during this season
are decidedly in the favor of the
State University. California's total
score is one hundred and twenty
two points to none for her adver
saries; while Stanford has been
able to pile up only eighty-two
points, while both Nevada and Re
liance made one field goal against
her. The list of games follows:

With the team chosen, the last
practice finished, and the Intercol
legiate gatne less than twenty
hours in the future, Stanford's
chances are brighter and her out
look more hopeful than at any
time before during this season.
The Varsity eleven is in many
respects one of the best that ever
bore the Cardinal against the Gold
and Blue. Its greatest shortcom
ing is found in its lack of experi
ence. In last year's Intercollegiate
there played only five of the eleven
men who will meet Stanford's rival
tomorrow. The three center men,
Hauverman, Captain Lee, and
Barnhisel,are old Varsity men and
all know the game from start to
.finish. Against this trio California
opposes Overall, Stroud, and Stow.

Overall, the Berkeley giant, has
been playing the game of his life
this season, but when he faces Lee
tomorrow he will play against a
man who in knowledge of the game
and ability to play is fully his
peer. Hauverman at center, al
though outweighed twenty-two
pounds, is the superior of his op
ponent in football ability. Barn
hisel can hold his own against Stow
and still be able to help McFadden
in his struggle with Captain Albert
son. At the other tackle Heit
muller, California's weakest man,
will play against the agile fresh
man. Sprott has had little football
experience 1 but has indicated
throughout the season that his
nerve is fine and that his head is
cool. The four ends are about

equal in ability, experience, and
weight. Clark probably is the best
of the quartette, but his superiority
over Hudson of California is
very slight.
In the back field the advantage
lies with the Cardinal. Bansbach
at quarter is the admitted superior
of More in generalship, although
his slight weight deprives him of
much value in backing up the line.
In ability to direct the plays and
power to hold the team together he
is invaluable. McGilvray at full
back is a sure ground gainer, but
Whipple of California is a slash
ing back. Mini at right half on
Berkeley eleven is a speedy back.
He is, perhaps, quicker on his feet
and more to be feared on end runs
than any man in either back-field.
Sherman, who was chosen to take
Smith's place, plays much the
same style of game that Mini does.
Dole and Tarpey are a stronger
pair than their opponents. Dole
is a careful, conscientious player
who rarely fails to gain his yards
on straight line bucking. Tarpey
is a wonder at following his inter
ference and is an extremely difficult
man to down when tackled. Indi
vidually Stanford compares favor
ably with California; as a team she
is perhaps stronger.
The Stanford eleven has de
veloped wonderfully in unity and
team-work during the last two
weeks. Its defense is probably su
perior to that of its rival. In of
fensive work it is not so strong.
The chief reliance of the Cardinal
will be in putting up an invulner
able defense to the onslaughts of
California on her line. In punting
Overall is the superior of McGil-
