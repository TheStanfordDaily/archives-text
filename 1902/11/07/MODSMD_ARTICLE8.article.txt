Tonight Stanford faces condi
tions almost identical with those
presented to the University of Cal
ifornia on the eve of the game a
year ago. The Varsity, with only
three men in its ranks who were
under fire in the last Intercollegi
ate match, are to meet a team of
veterans, whose native abilities
have been supplemented by long
and effective drill. In spite of the
odds against her, Berkeley cap
tured the victory by virtue of sheer
pluck and determination, the fac
tors which have been strongest at
Stanford this year.
From the first of the season it
has been evident that a perfect un
derstanding existed between team
and student body, and the atmos
phere has been tense with enthusi
asm. The determination, gener
ated in the bitter defeat last year,
to make this a Cardinal victory
has, we believe, produced a team
that will bring victory to Stanford.
