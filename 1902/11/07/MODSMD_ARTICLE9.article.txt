And now a word to the Second
team men: It may have seemed, at
intervals during the long season of
practice, that the college was unap
preciative of your efforts. With
eager watchfulness we have fol
lowed the movements of your op
ponents, and when we have cheered
it has usually been for a man who
tomorrow will wear an tmblem
which you would give anything to
possess. But do not conclude from
this that the University is not
keenly alive to the fact that the
eleven which is to face California
is the direct result of your effort.
A team without adequate practice
is only the elements of a team. It

is the constant opposition of a
fighting Second eleven that makes
it possible for a team to struggle
successfully against a determined
rival. If Stanford wins tomorrow,
you share the victory; if Stanford
loses â€”but it will not lose! You
have heard it said that the Second
team man goes unrewarded. VVe
do not believe it, neither do you.
The Stanford "S" is merely a sym
bol; what it stands for is the spirit
that impels a man to fight for his
University because his University
needs him.
