# TRIUMPH FOR BLUE AND GOLD.
## Two Goals from the Field and a Marvelous Run Gave Victory to California in the Intercollegiate Game. 
### 
Two men of California were re
sponsible for the defeat- the Blue
and Gold inflicted upon the Cardi
nal last Saturday in a struggle be
tween teams almost evenly matched.
Overall and Sherman scored 1G
points in the twelfth Intercollegiate
football match, the cleanest, the
most evenly contested, the most ex
citing game of football ever played
on the Coast. Sixteen to nought
was the score, which utterly fails to
tell of the ineffectual attacks made
by Berkeley upon the Cardinal
line, which tells nothing of the
magnificent strength of the Stan
ford forwards, the effectual resist
ance of the Stanford ends, the
stonewall defense of the Stanford
backs. Two place-kicks and a dash
of 100 yards from Magee's punt,
gave California sixteen points in
the seventy minutes of play, during
which she had been able to make
her first down only twice. Time
after time the Cardinal successfully
attacked the Berkeley line and ran
Hudson's end. But Stanford had
no Overall, and Fortune reserved
all her smiles for California.
Two things were responsible for
California's victory: better running
in of kicks and better team-work
in place-kicking. On scrimmage
work the Cardinal line was im
pregnable. On kicks, Overall sac
rificed that extra second which
would enable a man to get through
and block, while the Stanford
kicker asked for the extra second
during which no line can hold.
Except in these two points Stan
ford was the equal if not the supe
rior of her opponent. Her defense
was fully as good, her attacks
slightly stronger. Every man on
(he team played the game of his
life, and his work went for nothing
only because it could not be con
centrated within the few consecu
tive minutes that are necessary for
scoring. At the end of the first
half it looked as if Stanford would
be the final victor. She had evi
denced her ability to withstand the
onslaughts of California, and she
had sent well-directed attacks upon
the Berkeley line. Then came
Sherman's run, another place-kick,
and the end.
The aftermath of a football game
is a difficult thing to treat of.
Berkeley partisans could not but
feel unjustly treated if their team
were not pronounced superior in
every feature of the game, when
they were able to out-score their
rivals completely. Yet mere jus
tice to Stanford players demands
that they be recognized as the
equals in ability and in spirit of
the men by whom they were de
feated. From Freshman Sprott,
who played a game like that of his
predecessor Traeger, to Clark, who
left the field at the call of the
coach only because it was found
necessary to have a Stanford man
who could equal Overall's punts;
from center to end and back to end

again the Stanford team put up an
invulnerable front to the Berkeley
attacks. Their defensive work was
the finest ever recorded on the
Coast. Only twice during the sev
enty minutes of play was California
able to pierce the line for a first
down. The Berkeleyan's heavy
tackle-back formations on center,
their well-protected tries on the
end, and their straight bucks at
tackle and guard, all met a common
fate. Stanford brawn and muscle
and grit blocked the path, and the
attacks came no farther than the
line of scrimmage.
The Cardinal's offensive work
was not up to the standard of its
defense. Yet there were several
places in the California line that
could not withstand the attacks of
the Stanford backs. Dole's work
was superb. He played hard and
low, his bucks were strong and
certain and as the whistle blew for
the close of the last half Dole was
being pulled from the bottom of
the pile, the ball under his arm,
five yards from where he received
it. "Pie'' Smith, who went in the
game in Tarpey's place, did as he
has never failed to do in an inter
collegiate game —made the best run
of the day for the Cardinal. He
got the ball on Stanford's forty-five
yard line and circled Hudson's end
for forty yards with little Bans
bach running ahead to clear the
path. McGilvray's bucks were
strong, but the weight opposed was
too great for him to be used to the
best advantage. In defensive work
he backed up the line again and
again.
After the game coaches and cap
tain expressed themselves as proud
of the showing made by the Car
dinal eleven. Their unanimous
opinion was that Stanford played
a great defensive game but was un
able to offset California's advantage
in punting. Sherman's run they
held to be more a combination of
circumstances fortunate for Cali
fornia than any evidence of her
superior play. It was the product
of good fortune and Sherman was
not slow to take advantage of the
opportunity to rush through the
field to a touchdown. Before Ma
gee's punt Stanford was not de
feated; after Sherman secured the
ball there was little hope left. But
to the San Francisco public, the
non-university public, this news
would have come as a surprise.
The spectators heard the Stanford
rooters pour forth a volume of
sound that rolled over the hills
toward the Presidio mingled with
the triumphant calls of California.
They saw the bleachers a mass of
waving cardinal when the team
left the field and heard the cheers
of pride with which the rooters
greeted their defeated team as it
passed their section on its way to
the dressing-room. And later they
saw the rooters march in solid
phalanx from the City Ilall to the

Palace Hotel, proud to wear the
Stanford red, proud to cheer for
the Stanford team.
Although Stanford perhaps was
deprived of no points by the work
of the officials, yet she suffered
several times from decisions re
sulting from poor judgment. The
work of Mr. Dudley, of Yale, can
be mentioned only in the most
praiseworthy terms. He was im
partial and painstakingly accurate
in his decisions. Referee Oliver's
judgment was so untrustworthy
that his decisions were patent to
the bleachers and side-lines as un
favorable to the Cardinal.
No severe injuries were suffered
by Stanford players. McFadden
wrenched one knee rather badly,
and Tarpey had an ankle twisted.
On the whole, the men were re
markably free from bruises and
sprains. In comparison, Califor
nia escaped less happily. Captain
Albertson was forced to give place
to Howard early in the first half,
and Hudson was also hurt. Every
man on the team bore some testi
mony to the fact that he had par
ticipated in the most hotly con
tested game ever played on the
Coast.
DETAILS OF THE GAME.
Albertson won the toss and
chose to defend the south goal, giv
ing Stanford the kick-off in the
face of a wind which rendered nil
all efforts at long-distance punting.
Captain Lee sent the ball to Al
bertson, who brought it in. Imme
diately Berkeley was forced to re
turn the ball and when the strong
wind had carried it over the Stan
ford line Albertson secured it again
011 McGilvray's kick from the
twenty-five-yard line. The Stan
ford line held like a wall, and in
her three tries at bucking the Blue
and Gold made less than three
yards. McGilvray punted thirty
five yards and again Stanford took
the ball on downs. Tarpey and
Dole made first down for Stanford,
but on the next play California
took the ball for off-side. Here
Overall tried his first place-kick,
forty-five yards from the goal. He
failed, and Bansbach ran the ball
in to the twenty-yard line. Cali
fornia took the ball on a fumble,
and Overall fell back for a try at
goal. The line held, the ball came
straight and swift, and a second
later when it had sailed between
the posts the score was California
5, Stanford 0. During the re
mainder of the half the battle was
fought all over the field. Tarpey
tried a place-kick from the forty
yard line and the ball was blocked.
Overall tried from the twenty-five
yard line but the ball went wide.
It was then that every Stanford
rooter came to his feet. McGilvray
kicked seventy yards and Stanford
held California for downs. Cali
fornia was penalized for off-side
play and the ball was Stanford's,
only twelve yards from the line.
The Blue and Gold held, however,
and the chance to score was lost
when Overall sent the ball thirty
yards down the field, Bansbach
running it in fifteen yards. Stan
ford was trying to find holes in
the line when the whistle blew,with
the ball thirty-four yards from the
goal line. Stanford had had the

advantage throughout the latter
part of the half.
Stow kicked off to Barnhisel, but
the violence of the tackle caused
the latter to lose the ball. Over
all's unsuccessful try for a field
goal gave McGilvray a free kick
down the field to Mini. At this
point Magee took Clark's place.
California made ineffectual at
tempts to advance the ball, and
was compelled to punt to Tarpey.
An interchange of punts followed,
Magee's last kick of sixty yards
leaving the ball on the thirty-yard
line. There it went to the Cardi
nal, California being penalized for
holding. Tarpey's try at field-goal
was blocked by Overall, and a Cal
ifornia man fell on the ball. Then
came Magee's punt over the entire
Berkeley team, and Sherman's long
100-yard run behind superb inter
ference to a touchdown. The goal
was kicked. Score 11 to 0.
Late in the half Tarpey and
Bansbach attempted a field-goal,
but as before the California players
were through in time to block the
kick. Shortly before the end of
the half Overall negotiated another
field-goal. Smith had meanwhile
been substituted for Tarpey, and
when the game ended the ball had
just been advanced forty yards to
California's thirty-five-yard line,
mainly through his efforts.
Fourteen men played for Califor
nia, fourteen for Stanford. The
men who participated were:

nal, California being penalized for
holding. Tarpey's try at field-goal
was blocked by Overall, and a Cal
ifornia man fell on the ball. Then
came Magee's punt over the entire
Berkeley team, and Sherman's long
100-yard run behind superb inter
ference to a touchdown. The goal
was kicked. Score 11 to 0.
Late in the half Tarpey and
Bansbach attempted a field-goal,
but as before the California players
were through in time to block the
kick. Shortly before the end of
the half Overall negotiated another
field-goal. Smith had meanwhile
been substituted for Tarpey, and
when the game ended the ball had
just been advanced forty yards to
California's thirty-five-yard line,
mainly through his efforts.
Fourteen men played for Califor
nia, fourteen for Stanford. The

Two men of California were re
sponsible for the defeat- the Blue
and Gold inflicted upon the Cardi
nal last Saturday in a struggle be
tween teams almost evenly matched.
Overall and Sherman scored 1G
points in the twelfth Intercollegiate
football match, the cleanest, the
most evenly contested, the most ex
citing game of football ever played
on the Coast. Sixteen to nought
was the score, which utterly fails to
tell of the ineffectual attacks made
by Berkeley upon the Cardinal
line, which tells nothing of the
magnificent strength of the Stan
ford forwards, the effectual resist
ance of the Stanford ends, the
stonewall defense of the Stanford
backs. Two place-kicks and a dash
of 100 yards from Magee's punt,
gave California sixteen points in
the seventy minutes of play, during
which she had been able to make
her first down only twice. Time
after time the Cardinal successfully
attacked the Berkeley line and ran
Hudson's end. But Stanford had
no Overall, and Fortune reserved
all her smiles for California.
Two things were responsible for
California's victory: better running
in of kicks and better team-work
in place-kicking. On scrimmage
work the Cardinal line was im
pregnable. On kicks, Overall sac
rificed that extra second which
would enable a man to get through
and block, while the Stanford
kicker asked for the extra second
during which no line can hold.
Except in these two points Stan
ford was the equal if not the supe
rior of her opponent. Her defense
was fully as good, her attacks
slightly stronger. Every man on
(he team played the game of his
life, and his work went for nothing
only because it could not be con
centrated within the few consecu
tive minutes that are necessary for
scoring. At the end of the first
half it looked as if Stanford would
be the final victor. She had evi
denced her ability to withstand the
onslaughts of California, and she
had sent well-directed attacks upon
the Berkeley line. Then came
Sherman's run, another place-kick,
and the end.
The aftermath of a football game
is a difficult thing to treat of.
Berkeley partisans could not but
feel unjustly treated if their team
were not pronounced superior in
every feature of the game, when
they were able to out-score their
rivals completely. Yet mere jus
tice to Stanford players demands
that they be recognized as the
equals in ability and in spirit of
the men by whom they were de
feated. From Freshman Sprott,
who played a game like that of his
predecessor Traeger, to Clark, who
left the field at the call of the
coach only because it was found
necessary to have a Stanford man
who could equal Overall's punts;
from center to end and back to end

again the Stanford team put up an
invulnerable front to the Berkeley
attacks. Their defensive work was
the finest ever recorded on the
Coast. Only twice during the sev
enty minutes of play was California
able to pierce the line for a first
down. The Berkeleyan's heavy
tackle-back formations on center,
their well-protected tries on the
end, and their straight bucks at
tackle and guard, all met a common
fate. Stanford brawn and muscle
and grit blocked the path, and the
attacks came no farther than the
line of scrimmage.
The Cardinal's offensive work
was not up to the standard of its
defense. Yet there were several
places in the California line that
could not withstand the attacks of
the Stanford backs. Dole's work
was superb. He played hard and
low, his bucks were strong and
certain and as the whistle blew for
the close of the last half Dole was
being pulled from the bottom of
the pile, the ball under his arm,
five yards from where he received
it. "Pie'' Smith, who went in the
game in Tarpey's place, did as he
has never failed to do in an inter
collegiate game —made the best run
of the day for the Cardinal. He
got the ball on Stanford's forty-five
yard line and circled Hudson's end
for forty yards with little Bans
bach running ahead to clear the
path. McGilvray's bucks were
strong, but the weight opposed was
too great for him to be used to the
best advantage. In defensive work
he backed up the line again and
again.
After the game coaches and cap
tain expressed themselves as proud
of the showing made by the Car
dinal eleven. Their unanimous
opinion was that Stanford played
a great defensive game but was un
able to offset California's advantage
in punting. Sherman's run they
held to be more a combination of
circumstances fortunate for Cali
fornia than any evidence of her
superior play. It was the product
of good fortune and Sherman was
not slow to take advantage of the
opportunity to rush through the
field to a touchdown. Before Ma
gee's punt Stanford was not de
feated; after Sherman secured the
ball there was little hope left. But
to the San Francisco public, the
non-university public, this news
would have come as a surprise.
The spectators heard the Stanford
rooters pour forth a volume of
sound that rolled over the hills
toward the Presidio mingled with
the triumphant calls of California.
They saw the bleachers a mass of
waving cardinal when the team
left the field and heard the cheers
of pride with which the rooters
greeted their defeated team as it
passed their section on its way to
the dressing-room. And later they
saw the rooters march in solid
phalanx from the City Ilall to the

Palace Hotel, proud to wear the
Stanford red, proud to cheer for
the Stanford team.
Although Stanford perhaps was
deprived of no points by the work
of the officials, yet she suffered
several times from decisions re
sulting from poor judgment. The
work of Mr. Dudley, of Yale, can
be mentioned only in the most
praiseworthy terms. He was im
partial and painstakingly accurate
in his decisions. Referee Oliver's
judgment was so untrustworthy
that his decisions were patent to
the bleachers and side-lines as un
favorable to the Cardinal.
No severe injuries were suffered
by Stanford players. McFadden
wrenched one knee rather badly,
and Tarpey had an ankle twisted.
On the whole, the men were re
markably free from bruises and
sprains. In comparison, Califor
nia escaped less happily. Captain
Albertson was forced to give place
to Howard early in the first half,
and Hudson was also hurt. Every
man on the team bore some testi
mony to the fact that he had par
ticipated in the most hotly con
tested game ever played on the
Coast.
DETAILS OF THE GAME.
Albertson won the toss and
chose to defend the south goal, giv
ing Stanford the kick-off in the
face of a wind which rendered nil
all efforts at long-distance punting.
Captain Lee sent the ball to Al
bertson, who brought it in. Imme
diately Berkeley was forced to re
turn the ball and when the strong
wind had carried it over the Stan
ford line Albertson secured it again
011 McGilvray's kick from the
twenty-five-yard line. The Stan
ford line held like a wall, and in
her three tries at bucking the Blue
and Gold made less than three
yards. McGilvray punted thirty
five yards and again Stanford took
the ball on downs. Tarpey and
Dole made first down for Stanford,
but on the next play California
took the ball for off-side. Here
Overall tried his first place-kick,
forty-five yards from the goal. He
failed, and Bansbach ran the ball
in to the twenty-yard line. Cali
fornia took the ball on a fumble,
and Overall fell back for a try at
goal. The line held, the ball came
straight and swift, and a second
later when it had sailed between
the posts the score was California
5, Stanford 0. During the re
mainder of the half the battle was
fought all over the field. Tarpey
tried a place-kick from the forty
yard line and the ball was blocked.
Overall tried from the twenty-five
yard line but the ball went wide.
It was then that every Stanford
rooter came to his feet. McGilvray
kicked seventy yards and Stanford
held California for downs. Cali
fornia was penalized for off-side
play and the ball was Stanford's,
only twelve yards from the line.
The Blue and Gold held, however,
and the chance to score was lost
when Overall sent the ball thirty
yards down the field, Bansbach
running it in fifteen yards. Stan
ford was trying to find holes in
the line when the whistle blew,with
the ball thirty-four yards from the
goal line. Stanford had had the

advantage throughout the latter
part of the half.
Stow kicked off to Barnhisel, but
the violence of the tackle caused
the latter to lose the ball. Over
all's unsuccessful try for a field
goal gave McGilvray a free kick
down the field to Mini. At this
point Magee took Clark's place.
California made ineffectual at
tempts to advance the ball, and
was compelled to punt to Tarpey.
An interchange of punts followed,
Magee's last kick of sixty yards
leaving the ball on the thirty-yard
line. There it went to the Cardi
nal, California being penalized for
holding. Tarpey's try at field-goal
was blocked by Overall, and a Cal
ifornia man fell on the ball. Then
came Magee's punt over the entire
Berkeley team, and Sherman's long
100-yard run behind superb inter
ference to a touchdown. The goal
was kicked. Score 11 to 0.

forty-five yards from the goal. He
failed, and Bansbach ran the ball
in to the twenty-yard line. Cali
fornia took the ball on a fumble,
and Overall fell back for a try at
goal. The line held, the ball came
straight and swift, and a second
later when it had sailed between
the posts the score was California
5, Stanford 0. During the re
mainder of the half the battle was
fought all over the field. Tarpey
tried a place-kick from the forty
yard line and the ball was blocked.
Overall tried from the twenty-five
yard line but the ball went wide.
It was then that every Stanford
rooter came to his feet. McGilvray
kicked seventy yards and Stanford
held California for downs. Cali
fornia was penalized for off-side
play and the ball was Stanford's,
only twelve yards from the line.
The Blue and Gold held, however,
and the chance to score was lost
when Overall sent the ball thirty
yards down the field, Bansbach
running it in fifteen yards. Stan
ford was trying to find holes in
the line when the whistle blew,with
the ball thirty-four yards from the
goal line. Stanford had had the

advantage throughout the latter
part of the half.
Stow kicked off to Barnhisel, but
the violence of the tackle caused
the latter to lose the ball. Over
all's unsuccessful try for a field
goal gave McGilvray a free kick
down the field to Mini. At this
point Magee took Clark's place.
California made ineffectual at
tempts to advance the ball, and
was compelled to punt to Tarpey.
An interchange of punts followed,
Magee's last kick of sixty yards
leaving the ball on the thirty-yard
line. There it went to the Cardi
nal, California being penalized for
holding. Tarpey's try at field-goal
was blocked by Overall, and a Cal
ifornia man fell on the ball. Then
came Magee's punt over the entire
Berkeley team, and Sherman's long
100-yard run behind superb inter
ference to a touchdown. The goal
was kicked. Score 11 to 0.
Late in the half Tarpey and
Bansbach attempted a field-goal,
but as before the California players
were through in time to block the
kick. Shortly before the end of
the half Overall negotiated another
field-goal. Smith had meanwhile
been substituted for Tarpey, and
when the game ended the ball had
just been advanced forty yards to
California's thirty-five-yard line,
mainly through his efforts.
Fourteen men played for Califor
nia, fourteen for Stanford. The
men who participated were:

Two men of California were re
sponsible for the defeat- the Blue
and Gold inflicted upon the Cardi
nal last Saturday in a struggle be
tween teams almost evenly matched.
Overall and Sherman scored 1G
points in the twelfth Intercollegiate
football match, the cleanest, the
most evenly contested, the most ex
citing game of football ever played
on the Coast. Sixteen to nought
was the score, which utterly fails to
tell of the ineffectual attacks made
by Berkeley upon the Cardinal
line, which tells nothing of the
magnificent strength of the Stan
ford forwards, the effectual resist
ance of the Stanford ends, the
stonewall defense of the Stanford
backs. Two place-kicks and a dash
of 100 yards from Magee's punt,
gave California sixteen points in
the seventy minutes of play, during
which she had been able to make
her first down only twice. Time
after time the Cardinal successfully
attacked the Berkeley line and ran
Hudson's end. But Stanford had
no Overall, and Fortune reserved
all her smiles for California.
Two things were responsible for
California's victory: better running
in of kicks and better team-work
in place-kicking. On scrimmage
work the Cardinal line was im
pregnable. On kicks, Overall sac
rificed that extra second which
would enable a man to get through
and block, while the Stanford
kicker asked for the extra second
during which no line can hold.
Except in these two points Stan
ford was the equal if not the supe
rior of her opponent. Her defense
was fully as good, her attacks
slightly stronger. Every man on
(he team played the game of his
life, and his work went for nothing
only because it could not be con
centrated within the few consecu
tive minutes that are necessary for
scoring. At the end of the first
half it looked as if Stanford would
be the final victor. She had evi
denced her ability to withstand the
onslaughts of California, and she
had sent well-directed attacks upon
the Berkeley line. Then came
Sherman's run, another place-kick,
and the end.
The aftermath of a football game
is a difficult thing to treat of.
Berkeley partisans could not but
feel unjustly treated if their team
were not pronounced superior in
every feature of the game, when
they were able to out-score their
rivals completely. Yet mere jus
tice to Stanford players demands
that they be recognized as the
equals in ability and in spirit of
the men by whom they were de
feated. From Freshman Sprott,
who played a game like that of his
predecessor Traeger, to Clark, who
left the field at the call of the
coach only because it was found
necessary to have a Stanford man
who could equal Overall's punts;
from center to end and back to end

again the Stanford team put up an
invulnerable front to the Berkeley
attacks. Their defensive work was
the finest ever recorded on the
Coast. Only twice during the sev
enty minutes of play was California
able to pierce the line for a first
down. The Berkeleyan's heavy
tackle-back formations on center,
their well-protected tries on the
end, and their straight bucks at
tackle and guard, all met a common
fate. Stanford brawn and muscle
and grit blocked the path, and the
attacks came no farther than the
line of scrimmage.
The Cardinal's offensive work
was not up to the standard of its
defense. Yet there were several
places in the California line that
could not withstand the attacks of
the Stanford backs. Dole's work
was superb. He played hard and
low, his bucks were strong and
certain and as the whistle blew for
the close of the last half Dole was
being pulled from the bottom of
the pile, the ball under his arm,
five yards from where he received
it. "Pie'' Smith, who went in the
game in Tarpey's place, did as he
has never failed to do in an inter
collegiate game —made the best run
of the day for the Cardinal. He
got the ball on Stanford's forty-five
yard line and circled Hudson's end
for forty yards with little Bans
bach running ahead to clear the
path. McGilvray's bucks were
strong, but the weight opposed was
too great for him to be used to the
best advantage. In defensive work
he backed up the line again and
again.
After the game coaches and cap
tain expressed themselves as proud
of the showing made by the Car
dinal eleven. Their unanimous
opinion was that Stanford played
a great defensive game but was un
able to offset California's advantage
in punting. Sherman's run they
held to be more a combination of
circumstances fortunate for Cali
fornia than any evidence of her
superior play. It was the product
of good fortune and Sherman was
not slow to take advantage of the
opportunity to rush through the
field to a touchdown. Before Ma
gee's punt Stanford was not de
feated; after Sherman secured the
ball there was little hope left. But
to the San Francisco public, the
non-university public, this news
would have come as a surprise.
The spectators heard the Stanford
rooters pour forth a volume of
sound that rolled over the hills
toward the Presidio mingled with
the triumphant calls of California.
They saw the bleachers a mass of
waving cardinal when the team
left the field and heard the cheers
of pride with which the rooters
greeted their defeated team as it
passed their section on its way to
the dressing-room. And later they
saw the rooters march in solid
phalanx from the City Ilall to the

Palace Hotel, proud to wear the
Stanford red, proud to cheer for
the Stanford team.
Although Stanford perhaps was
deprived of no points by the work
of the officials, yet she suffered
several times from decisions re
sulting from poor judgment. The
work of Mr. Dudley, of Yale, can
be mentioned only in the most
praiseworthy terms. He was im
partial and painstakingly accurate
in his decisions. Referee Oliver's
judgment was so untrustworthy
that his decisions were patent to
the bleachers and side-lines as un
favorable to the Cardinal.
No severe injuries were suffered
by Stanford players. McFadden
wrenched one knee rather badly,
and Tarpey had an ankle twisted.
On the whole, the men were re
markably free from bruises and
sprains. In comparison, Califor
nia escaped less happily. Captain
Albertson was forced to give place
to Howard early in the first half,
and Hudson was also hurt. Every
man on the team bore some testi
mony to the fact that he had par
ticipated in the most hotly con
tested game ever played on the
Coast.
DETAILS OF THE GAME.
Albertson won the toss and
chose to defend the south goal, giv
ing Stanford the kick-off in the
face of a wind which rendered nil
all efforts at long-distance punting.
Captain Lee sent the ball to Al
bertson, who brought it in. Imme
diately Berkeley was forced to re
turn the ball and when the strong
wind had carried it over the Stan
ford line Albertson secured it again
011 McGilvray's kick from the
twenty-five-yard line. The Stan
ford line held like a wall, and in
her three tries at bucking the Blue
and Gold made less than three
yards. McGilvray punted thirty
five yards and again Stanford took
the ball on downs. Tarpey and
Dole made first down for Stanford,
but on the next play California
took the ball for off-side. Here
Overall tried his first place-kick,
forty-five yards from the goal. He
failed, and Bansbach ran the ball
in to the twenty-yard line. Cali
