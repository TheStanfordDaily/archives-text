Jb 1 ever there was honor in de
feat it belonged in full measure to
the Stanford eleven when it emerged
from the amazing struggle of Sat
urday afternoon. It was not mere
sense of duty that brought every
wearer of the Cardinal to his feet
at the end of the game, cheering as
long and lustily as if a mighty
victory had been won. The tie be
tween the Team and the Student
Body has from the first been of
firmer fibre than mutual obliga
tion. And now, freed from the ex
citement of the contest and the re
action, and yet coming to realize
to the full how greivous was our
disappointment, it is not sympathy
for a losing team that we would
try to express. Rather should we
do homage to men who exempli
fied what we have come to know as
the Stanford spirit in such a way
as did the eleven led by Captain
Lee. The cheers that greeted the
players at the end were but faint
tribute to the men who all season
have worked with a determina
tion that developed an un
tried field of candidates into
a unit whose efficiency still seems
marvelous—a team which fought
at the hopeless end as gamely as
when the match opened. In itself
defeat is always bitter. Saturday's
defeat was doubly so because of the
many critical moments throughout
the game when a wee bit of fortune
wafted our way would have brought
a Cardinal triumph. But fortune
alone could not have carried suc
cess to California. It was her
ability to take advantage of every
"lucky moment" that proved her
superiority. The day was unmis
takably California's: Stan ford con
gratulates her on having won a
clear-cut victory over a team at

whose hands defeat would have
been honorable.
Defeat cannot change the atti
tude of the University toward the
Team —it has merely intensified our
loyalty and our resolution to work
together with greater unity and
greater energy. To Captain Lee
and the thirteen other men who wore
the "S," to Coaches Clemens and
Slaker and Lewers, and Murphy
and Spalding and Searles, to "Dad"
Moulton—by whom a team was
never better cared for —to the sub
stitutes and Second Eleven men,
and to all others who lent a help
ing hand, the University owes a
world of gratitude that it can never
repay.
