# ROWING POSSIBILITIES.
## President of California Boating Association Submits Results of Visit to Stanford. 
### 
The Athletic Committee has re
ceived a letter from J. E. Road
house, president of the Boating As
sociation of the University of Cali
fornia, giving a report of obser
vations made at the time of his
visit here to talk over the prospect
of establishing intercollegiate row
ing relations between Stanford and
California. Following is the
letter:
Stanford Athletic Committee, Stan
ford University, California.
(ientlemen: As a result of inves
tigations of possibilities for inter
collegiate boating, I write to submit
the following to your Athletic Com
mittee:
1. Situation. —The best situation
for a boat-house would be at a
point near the mouth of a large
slough, a short distance past the
Town and Gown Hunting Club.
Here the slough is amply deep and
wide for barges or shells at the
lowest tides, and at the time when
visited the bay was perfectly
smooth; and, judging from other
parts of the bay, it would be suit
able for rowing under any ordinary
conditions, since a slight swell is
not objectionable.
The distance on the map is not
more than four miles from Encina
Hall, which, over the Embarcadero
road by wheel, could be readily
made in about twenty-five min
utes.
2. Quarters. —For $1,000 a boat
house could be built which would
be sufficient for present needs. A
site for the building could readily
be obtained from the Town and
Gown Hunting Club, the lessees of
the land.
3. Training barges cost from
$150 to $275 each, and shells about
the same. By bringing a boat
builder from the Eaßt and con
structing two or three, they could
be built for less. As we need more
boats, we would be glad to share
the expense in such an undertak
ing. A Stanford graduate has been
heard of who may he willing to
purchase a couple of boats for Stan
ford.
4. Meets.— The intercollegiate
meets could best be held on Ala
meda Creek near its mouth, where
there is a straight course of several
miles, parallel to the narrow gauge
track, on which an observation
train could be run, composed of
flat-cars with bleachers, the receipts
from which would meet expenses.
As the fall is the best training
season, a favorable time for the
meet would be New Year's Day,
thus not interfering with college
activities —also giving a few days
for final training.
Expressing the unanimous senti
ment of this University, I hope y< u
may soon be able to consider this
matter seriously and favorably.
Yours very truly,
J. E. Roadiiouse,
President B. A. U. C.
