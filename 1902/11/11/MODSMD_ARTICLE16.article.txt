It would be hard to imagine
anything from which could be de
rived greater satisfaction than the
announcement that the University
Band is in a fair way to become a
permanent organization. For years
a company of capable musi
cians have drilled conscientiously
through half of each fall semester
for the sole purpose of making
their efforts felt on the single after
noon devoted to the Intercollegiate
football game. The match over,
instruments have gone back to
their cases, and when Stanford and
California have clashed again it
has been either with no music at
all, or with both universities
cheered by the efforts of Berkeley's
cadet band. There is no reason
why the Band should not become
permanent. The practice would
take no more time than that of the
musical clubs, the Orchestra, and
other organizations whose activity
continues through the year. And
there never was a better time to or
ganize permanently than now,
when an efficient and enthusiastic
leader and a capable company of
players have effected a combination
of which the University is justly
proud. By all means, let us have
a Band that will play on occasions
of note, and between times if they
will. And, in return, let us see to
it that there be no occasion for the
players to believe that their efforts
are not fully appreciated.
