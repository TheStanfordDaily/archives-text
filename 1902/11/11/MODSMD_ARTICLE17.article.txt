Two new text-books have recent
ly been edited by members of the
English department:
Prof. A. G. Newcomer has pre
pared for the Lake English Clas
sics, published by Scott, Foresman,
& Co., a selection of Foe's writings,
containing the best of the poems
and ten representative tales. The
sane and appreciative introduction,

which is based upon Professor New
comer's "American Literature,"
helps much to make the book the
most satisfactory of the volumes of
selections from Poe.
Prof. R. M. Alden's edition of
"Julius Caesar" is published by
Benjamin H. Sanborn & Co., in the
Cambridge Literature Series. The
introduction and notes are of a
kind to help the student to a keen
appreciation of the play, and to en
courage him to go to those books of
reference with which readers of
Shakspere should be familiar.
