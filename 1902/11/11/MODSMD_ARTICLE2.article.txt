Treasurer Edwards went to San
Francisco today to meet Manager
Decoto of Berkeley. After the con

ference definite figures concerning
the financial outcome of Saturday's
game will be available. The re
ceipts of the match were $24,000,
$4,000 more than last year.
The expenditures will amount to
much more than for any previous
contest. The lease of the grounds
and the erection of stands cost
$9,000.
