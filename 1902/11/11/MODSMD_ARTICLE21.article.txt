Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The philanthropic committee of
the Y. W. C. A. will make its first
collection on Saturday next. The
campus and a large part of Palo
Alto have been canvassed for cast
off clothing, books, etc., and on
Saturday a wagon iB to go around
and collect the promised articles.
Jt is hoped they can be shipped
that night to places where they are
needed in the city. If there is any
one whom the committee has not
reached who has any articles to
send, a postal mailed to Miss K. 11.
Kip (Univ. P. 0.) before Thursday
will insure a call on Saturday.
