# Permanent Organization for Band.
## 
### 
As a result of a canvass among
the members of the University
Band, it seems probable that the
organization will become perma
nent, ready to play at proper occa
sions throughout the college year.
Heretofore the musicians have dis
banded after the big game, and
this has made an entire reorgani
zation necessary every fall. Re
hearsals will be held twice a week
under the leadership of M. 11.
Thorpe, '05, and the Band will con
tinue with about the same member
ship as during the fall.
