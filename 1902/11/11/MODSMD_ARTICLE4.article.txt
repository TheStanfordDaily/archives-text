# Ethnologist Tells of the Indians.

### 
At the chapel this afternoon,
Captain Newton W. Chittenden
erected his wigwam, and enter
tained the audience with a talk on
the fine collection of Indian curios
with which it was decorated. Al
though the lecture was to be on the
Indians of California, the Captain
decided to show first some of his
relics from British Columbia and
Arizona, with the result that he
had little time left for the interest
ing collection from the State. Cap
tain Chittenden takes issue with
the view of modern science that the
earth has been inhabited for hun
dreds of thousands of years. The
Bible theory seems quite reasonable
to him. Types of men develop
very rapidly. Here in America we
have developed the Texan, the
Georgian, and the New England
types. He produced two human
skulls, one of a cliff-dweller, the
other from Vancouver Island, show
ing two distinct types of men.
"These types may have developed
within 6000 years," he said. "There
is nothing to prove that life is
older."
The idea that the American
tribes numbered ten or fifteen mil
lions Captain Chittenden styled as
probably erroneous. Three or four
millions is probably nearer the
mark. Science is probably also in
error regarding the date of the
cliff-dwellers. From personal ex
ploration, the speaker believes they
were still alive when Columbus dis
covered America.
