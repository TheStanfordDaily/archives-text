# PRELIMINARY BASEBALL.
## Candidates for Nine to be Called Out for Practice Very Soon. 
### 
After the excitement over foot
ball has quieted down, the interest
in the athletic calendar will be di
rected toward the track and base
ball diamond. As soon as the
weather gets settled Captain
Brown will have all the aspir
ants for the baseball nine appear
for the first preliminary prac
tice of the year. Barring bad
weather, the men will be put
through light practice for about a
month. The object is to get the
players' arms in shape, and to cul
tivate the baseball eye for next
semester. For the first week, at
least, there will be no regular
games, but when the candidates
round into partial shape matches
may be looked for between the
first and second nines. There is a
probability that some sort of a cage
will be arranged for batting prac
tice. Experience in picking up
grounders and skill in base
throwing are to be drilled into the
team. The fielders are to be
worked in squads as last year.
There will be no attempt to give as
pirants for the pitcher's box any
hard work. The aim is to get the
men in trim, so that the opening of
the season will find the squad al
ready somewhat experienced.
This fall practice will be first
opportunity for the captain to size
up the new material. There is a
hard proposition facing this branch
of college sport, as last year's
squad has been materially weak
ened by the loss of good players.
To increase interest it is probable
that one good game will be arranged
between Santa Clara and the Var
sity. The former nine has offered
to meet the team on this campus
at any convenient date. In addi
tion there is under discussion the
matter of class games.
The diamond is in fairly good
condition, and with a little work
can be putin excellent shape.
Last year's Varsity has eight
men buck in college: McGilvray,
catcher; Parker, pitcher; Blake,
lirst base; Crawford, short-stop;
Copj), third base; Lowenthnl, left
field; Captain Brown, center; and
Knight, right- field. McFarland
has entered a medical school in
Los Angeles, and is not to return.
Cowden, captain of last year's nine,
is not sure of returning the second
semester. In case he fails to come
hack, Ball, '03, who caught on the
1901 nine, can be worked into some
infield position.
Of last year's second team, there
are in college: Tritch, pitcher;
Trowbridge, Doherty, Stillman,
Kehrlein, and Tarpey. There is
still some chance that Roosevelt
may return to college next semes
ter. In case he does, he will be a
valuable addition to the bunch of
candidates for the infield.
Among the freshman possibili
ties there are: Lewis of Kansas,
who played second base on his
academy nine; Colbert, Wurt,Sales,
who captained and pitched for the
Fust Denver high school nine; Lilt,
Williams, Atwood, Lovell, and
Spencer.
