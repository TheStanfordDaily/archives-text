The University Orchestra has
not received the support it merits
this semester, largely because of the
fact that many of its members have
been devoting their efforts to the
Band. But with the strain of the
football season over there should
be no reason for a neglect of this
important feature of Stanford's
musical activity. The Orchestra
needs more members —instruments
of all sorts. Its membership is
practically limited only by the
number of capable musicians that
join its ranks. Participation in its
work is a privilege in more ways
than one. It offers both a means
of aiding student activity and of
personal training whose value can
not be overestimated.
