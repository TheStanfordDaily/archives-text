Anyone who, for the past few
years, has been intimately con
nected with Stanford athletics, and
has been so situated that he could
comprehend the attitude of the ath
lete toward his work, cannot but
appreciate the spirit now prevalent
among the men of the University.
Two years ago fall training in
baseball and track was practically
unheard of; the idea was generally
conceded to be absurdly imprac
ticable. A graduate of 1901, not
familiar with the change of a
twelve-month, would be agroeably
surprised to find today dozens of
men on the cinder-path. Almost
any hour a bunch of runners may
be seen pegging quietly around the
oval, getting in trim to do battle
for the Cardinal next April. The
spirit they exhibit is one we cannot
but admire. It is the spirit of per
manent enthusiasm, of determina
tion to succeed, and it argues well
for the future. Trainer Moulton
tersely said to his men a month
ago, "If wo lose the football it is

up to you to win the truck." And
so the University says to the men
who are out with Captain Brown
and Captain McCaughern: "Foot
ball is lost; it is up to
you to win both baseball and
track." Toward that end nothing
will contribute more effectively
than the fall work now in progress.
