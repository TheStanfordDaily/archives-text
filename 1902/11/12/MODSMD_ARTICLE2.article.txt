# PREPARING FOR UTAH TRIP.
## Light Practice and Strict Training Rules From Monday Until Thanksgiving. 
### 
Preparations for the Stanford-
Utah football game to be held in
Salt Lake City Thanksgiving Day
will begin Monday afternoon. Strict
training will be in vogue at Stan
ford from that time until the game
has been played. The contest will
undoubtedly be a hard one, as the
University of Utah has placed a
strong team in the field this season.
The line is unusually heavy, the
men averaging nearly 190 lbs.,
while in the backfield the average
weight is 185 lbs. Although the
Stanford eleven, which will meet
these men of brawn, is much
slighter in weight it is a surety that
it will render a good account of
itself in the Mormon city. Fifteen
men will make the thirty-six-hour
trip with Manager Edwards. As
fourteen men played in the Varsity
game the competition for the re
maining position is sure to be keen.
Captain Lee has stated that no
man need expect to go with the
team who has not attended prac
tices and kept strict training rules.
The work will probably not in
volve any scrimmaging but will
consist of signal practice, running
in of punts, and tackling. This
will be severe enough to ensure
that the team be in condition
to withstand the change in altitude,
which will prove a strain on the
Stanford players unused to such
climatic conditions.
