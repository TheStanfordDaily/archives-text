# BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS.
## An Interesting Collection of Old Prints Installed in University Museum. 
### 
One of the rarest and most inter
esting collections in the Museum is
that of old books and manuscripts
recently installed in the corridor of
the vestibule.
Among the manuscripts is a
sketch of Julius Hospital in Wurtz
burg, Germany, done on parch
ment in 1554. There are several
autograph albums of the eighteenth
century, one of them that of a lieu
tenant in the army of Frederick
the Great. Several of the battles
of that leader are described and il
lustrated by officers who took part.
There are many newspapers printed
in the early days of the United
States, among them the "Indepen
dent Chronicle" piinted in Boston
in 1795. A very rare and valu
able book is a hand-painted and
illuminated catalogue of the arms
of Nuremburg families who had
chairs in the church of the Augus
tin Monastery in Nuremburg in
1625. A book, one of the rarest in
the collection treating of the art of
artillery in 1621, was procured by
Mrs. Stanford after it had passed
through the hands of several British
officers of high rank.
Another large collection em
braces Bibles, prayer-books, and
religious tracts, in old English,
German, and Latin, most of them
of the sixteenth century.
There are several editions of
Latin authors, among them Cicero's
"Complete Works." Aristotle's
"Natural History," illustrated and
translated into Latin, 1536, is also
in the collection. An illustrated
text of Terence of 1492, with notes
and explanations, is the oldest
book in the collection. There are
also an illustrated edition of Virgil,
1502; Seneca's "Moral Essays,"
1591; "Justinian's Codes," 1551, in
four large pigskin-bound volumes.
A very interesting little volume is
a "Book of Magic," published in
1500, dealing with ghosts, specters,
and changes of rule. There is a
Latin treatise on palmistry and
astrology, published in the six
teenth century.
The gem of the collection is an
ancient, hand-painted and illum
inated edition of the Koran. The
initial letters are done in beaten
gold. The book is the only one in
the United States. It is impossible
to procure another, since it is worth
a man's life to be caught smuggling
one out of Turkey.
Mrs. Stanford has succeeded in
procuring a set of marbles sculp
tured by G. Broutos, professor of
sculpture in the famous Polytech
nic School of Greece. Broutos is
one of the foremost living Greek
sculptors, and is a lineal descend
ant of Pericles. The set, com
posed of twelve distinct tablets of
Carara marbles, representing the
twelve greater Greek gods and
goddesses, has been placed in the
north art gallery.
