# PROGRESS ON BUILDINGS.
## Business Office Will be Occupied Next Week.â€”Other Work Delayed. 
### 
The massive foundations for the
new gymnasium are being rushed
with all possible speed, and if no
unforeseen difficulty arises they
ought to be ready to receive the cut
stone by December 15th. Excavat
ing for the Geology and Mining
building has been in progress all
week, and the concrete men will
commence their operations next
week. Excavations for all the re
maining buildings of the Outer
Quadrangle are also finished, and
the Mechanical and Civil Engineer
ing building on the southeast
corner of the Outer Quad is almost
ready for the roof. This building
will be ready for occupancy about
March Ist. The Business Office of
the University is receiving its fin
ishing touches. Treasurer Lathrop
will move into his new quarters
sometime next week. There yet
remains to be putin a small amount
of tiling.
Some delay has been met in the
excavations for the additions to
the Museum, and the concrete men
have been accordingly hampered
in their work. They have started
again this week and will proceed
as fast as the excavating permits.
The Chemistry building cannot be
occupied by the department for at
least two months. There is still
much in the way of fixtures and
equipment to be installed. Most
of this is to be shipped from the
East, and will take some time to
arrange. The chances for the de
partment occupying its new
quarters by January Ist are very
slim. In case the change from its
present quarters cannot be made
by the middle of January, the
transfer will not occur until the
summer vacation.
The Physiology building in the
Outer Quadrangle is almost done,
as is the Zoology headquarters ad
joining. The two corner structures
of the facade, the Physics and the
Economics and History buildings,
have not been touched for some
time. The delay is caused by the
impossibility of getting plasterers.
There is no possibility of these de
partments being ready before the
latter part of next semester.
The improvements in front of
the facade are progressing. The
stone steps leading from the terrace
wall to the facade will be finished
at an early date. The space be
tween the wall and the buildings
is being filled with good, black soil
and grass will be planted.
