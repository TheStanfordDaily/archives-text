# FINANCES OF GAME.
## Over $17,000 Will Be Divided Between Stanford and California. 
### 
Yesterday Treasurer Harry J.
Edwards conferred with the Cali
fornia treasurer, Ezra Decoto, re
garding the finances of Saturday's
game. The total receipts from the
sale of tickets amounted to $23,-
231.50, exceeding last year's re
ceipts about $4,000. The total sum
of expenditures is not yet in shape,
but it will aggregate about $5,500,
which is at least $1,000 more than
the outlay of a year ago. The two
universities will divide about $17,-
500 between them, each receiving
an amount nearly $1,500 greater
than from previous games.
The chief item of expenditures
will be the bill of I). E. Brown, '97,
who contracted for the grounds
and the building of the bleachers
and grandstands. The umpire and
referee will be paid $175 for their
services. Other bills to be con
sidered are those of ticket sellers,
police, and printers.
The two managers will meet
again tomorrow, and soon after an
itemized account will be pub
lished.
