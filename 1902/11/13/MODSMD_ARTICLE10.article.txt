The success that marked the
fifst of the University meetings
seems destined to be duplicated
next Thursday, for it is announced
that the speakers will be Professor
Albert W. Smith and Mr. F. H.
Wheelan, both of them men to
whose appearance the University
will look forward with keen inter
est. On the rare occasions when
Professor Smith has been persuaded
to address a Stanford audience he
has won wide popularity. And,
too, he comes from a technical de
partment, which seems to indicate
that the meetings are to be truly of
a University type. Mr. Wheelan,
it will be remembered, as president
of the University Club in San
Francisco appointed the committee
before which the Smith case was
decided, and presided at its ses
sions. As a result of the Stanford
attitude in the controversy, the
University has gained in him a
staunch and influential friend.
