Manager Edwards in endeavor
ing to arrange a Southern trip for
the Second team has the approba
tion of the University. The
Second had no such incentive dur
ing the season. It fortunately
seems possible at Stanford to se
cure cooperation without holding
out the inducement of hypothetical
Western trips, as is possibly the
custom at Georgetown and Wis
consin. Such a journey is justly
merited because of faithful work
with no prospect of such a reward.
If a match with a South
ern team is arranged the University
will insist that it be advertised for
what it is. The people about Los
Angeles must understand that it is
not the Varsity which is to play,
nnd that no misleading announce
ments will be tolerated. Thus

there can be 110 misunderstanding
and no possibility of discomfiture.
The name of Stanford lias in the
past been carelessly handled by
unscrupulous managers who had
no connection with the University.
Manager Edwards has uniformly
endeavored to check such practices,
and his efforts should be actively
secsnded by every individual who
counts himself one of the Univer
sity's friends.
