# ASSESSMENTS MUST BE PAID
## Manager of Junior Annual Urges Necessity of Meeting "Quad" Dues at Once. 
### 
To the Class of I'JOj,
At the meeting of the class this
year an assess men t of $3.00 was
levied on each member of the class
to help defray the expenses of the
Quad. There has been a call for
these assessments for the last two
months, but less than half of them
have been paid. At the same time
it was voted that only those mem
bers of the class who had paid their
assessment be allowed to have their
picture in the book.
in order to get the photographs
and the plates made at the least
expense, it is necessary that the
pictures be taken before December
Ist. If we are forced to run later
than that and into next semester it
may lead to a deficit at the close of
the year caused by the extra ex
pense of the rush at the end.
1 will be in room 10 on the quad
Friday, November 14th, from 1:00
to 1:30 to receive the assessments,
and also Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday of next week.
After the assessments are paid it
will be just as necessary that the
pictures be taken immediately, as
il was to pay assessments.
