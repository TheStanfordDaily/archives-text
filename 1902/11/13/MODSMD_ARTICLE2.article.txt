# Professor Robertson's Address.

### 
Prof. C. H. Robertson of Purdue
University addressed the men of
Stanford last evening at the reg
ular mid-week meeting of the Y. M.
C. A. Professor Robertson is en
route for China, where he will serve
as a missionary to the 1 iterrati of
that country. The members of
this cultured class, numbering more
than a million, are the hardest
men in the world to reach, and in
going to them Professor Robertson
acknowledged that he had a hard
task before him.
After explaining his position in
the missionary field Professor
Robertson proceeded to make a
strong plea for the missionary life.
Some of us, he said, should go out
to the missionary fields of China,
of Africa, and of India, and at
least all should pray for the mis
sionaries now in the field and sup
port them liberally in a financial
way.
The world has a mistaken idea
about missionaries, the speaker
said. In the old days the men who
went out to the foreign missionary
fields deprived themselves of the
necessaries of life and lived as
much like the heathen as possible.
One man went to India and started
to teach the natives with only a
prnyer-book in his hands and a
blanket to shelter him at night.
A native seeing the blanket scoffed
at it, saying a man who taught the
gospel had no need of a blanket.
The missionary did not throw away
his blanket but did throw away
his erroneous ideas. That was the
old way.
The new way is to send a man
to the missionary field properly
equipped, just as a trading house
sends out its men with best physi
cal comforts. In order to do good
work Professor Robertson said a
man must be properly clothed,
well housed and fed. This method
has been found to bring about the
best results.
