# FOOTBALL TEAMS IN DEMAND
## Games Wanted by the Universities of Nevada and Colorado During Thanksgiving Trip. 
### 
Manager Edwards has received a
telegram from the football manager
of the University of Colorado at
Boulder, asking for a game with
the Varsity on November 22d. It
is improbable that Stanford
will meet the Colorado men,
as there is much objection on the
part of the team to playing more
than one game during the Eastern
trip. The management at Reno
has also written asking for a game
with the Varsity either on its way
to or return from Salt Lake, and it
is very certain that this latter
proposition will receive a negative
answer.
While the contest with the Utah
eleven is going on at Salt Lake the
Second team may be taking part in
a similar struggle at Los Angeles
with the Perris Indian team. In
response to a letter from Manager
Edwards asking that a game be
arranged for the Second team with
sine picked eleven at Los Angeles
on Thanksgiving Day, Jack Shee
han, '95, has taken the matter in
hand and will try to bring about a
match. The Perris Indians will
undoubtedly be the owponents of
the Second team men, and if so a
good hard contest will result.
Last Thanksgiving the Var
sity defeated the Indians by a good
score, but the red men put up a
fierce game.
The Chico Normal School team
wants to play the Freshmen, minus
Mngee, on the coming holiday.
They assert that Magee ought not
to play with the '06 men, since he
made the Varsity. The proposi
tion cannot be favorably consid
ered.
