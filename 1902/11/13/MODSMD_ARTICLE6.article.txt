# BOTANICAL COLLECTION.
## Specimens and Library of Great Value, Gathered by Dr. Harkness, Secured by University. 
### 
A scientific collection of rare
value has just been secured by Mrs.
Stanford in the shape of many
botanical specimens and of one
hundred and eighty bound volumes
and eight hundred and fifty pam
phlets, which were the property of
Dr. Harvey W. Harkness of San
Francisco, who, from 1891 until his
death a year ago, was a trustee of
Stanford University.
Dr. Harkness was the principal
authority in the world on the fungi
of the Pacific Coast, and published
various papers reporting many new
species.
In 1891 he presented to the Cali
fornia Academy of Sciences his
general collection of fungi, num
bering over ten thousand species;
but his most important special col
lection of the hypogaeous (or un
derground) fungi, together with his
scientific library and several for
eign collections of mounted fungi
aggregating about fifteen hundred
species, come to the University.
His most important work was
the publication of his "Californian
Hypogaeous Fungi," in the pro
ceedings of the California Academy
for 1899. These plants are trullles
and related species of fungi. He
described 108 species in his paper,
of which 59, all from Central
California, were new, and he after
ward described nearly twenty addi
tional species. Most of the types
used in describing the new species
are in the collection purchased, in
very good condition and of price
less value to the future student of
the group. Elsewhere in the
United States this group is very
poorly represented. Altogether
there are above three hundred
small jars of these specimens in
the collection. The mounted col
lections of fungi foreign to Califor
nia are the comparatively rare set
of Ravenel's "Fungi Americani"
from South Carolina, 800 in num
ber, 500 mounts of Rabenhorst's
"Fungi Europaei," besides a few
hundred of the more recent col
lections of Ellis in the Eastern
states.
The most valuable works in Dr.
Harkness' library are on fungi.
Some of the most important were
not before available at the Uni
versity. In the collection are the fol
lowing amongothers: Saccardo'sSyl
loge Fungorum (as far as published)
in thirteen volumes, describing all
known fungi; the yearly report of
the British Association for the Ad
vancement of Science, sixteen vol
umes, from 1885 to 1900 â€”an im
portant set; "Corda's Icones Fun
gorum," six volumes complete;
"Tulasne's Fungi Hypogaei " ;
" Hesse's Hypogaei v. Deutsch
land"; "Vittadini's Monographia
Tuberacea)"; "Sturm's Flora," seven
volumes complete; "Saccardo's
Fungi Italici," 1500 plates of fig
ures; "Fries' Systerna Mycologica,"
and his "Hyenenomycetes, Gre
villea," a mycological journal,
twenty-two volumes, all published;
"Leighton's Lichen Flora of Great
Britain"; "The annual reports of
the State Botanist of New York."
