# HANDICAP FIELD-DAY.
## Track Men Will Show the Results of Fall Training a Week From Saturday. 
### 
A week from next Saturday, No
vember 22d, there will be held on
the oval a handicap field-day at
which all those interested in track
may size up the chances of the
Cardinal in the intercollegiate
match next spring. This field-day
in many ways should be much
more successful than the one held
last fall. There is a larger squad
at work, and those who will enter
will be in better condition. As last
year, the distances will be short
ened about a third. Coach Moul
ton and Captain McCaughern will
arrange the handicaps.
While the number of men who
have been out on the track has
been sizeable, it has not turned out
as much untried material as the
coach had wished. Moulton's
method of development requires a
large amount of material from
which to choose. The Freshmen
have not been showing up nearly
as well as expected. Lovel, the
little Campbell high school miler,
has been bothered with a bad
ankle, which may hinder his per
formances next spring. Abbott,
the high jumper who was injured
last month, will be out next
semester. Many who were said
to be good men have not yet com
menced training.
Last year's Varsity members are
out in force. McCaughern, Haw
leÂ£, Taylor, Dunn, Thomson, Gay,
Holman, Crossman, Whittaker,
and Bubb are among them. J. M.
Beach and Norman Dole have been
doing some high jumping and pole
vaulting. Kuhn, who just before
the intercollegiate last year was
taken down with appendicitis, will
probably be on the track after
Christmas. The cinder-path is in
good condition and will be kept in
shape throughout the year. This
will insure better conveniences for
proper training than Stanford has
had for some years.
"Dad" Moulton will devote his
time from now on to the develop
ment of individual performers.
"We have an immense amount of
work to do between now and April,"
he said today. "The men seem to
realize that they have a hard job
before them and seem willing to
work. That is what I want, for if
they do not work, and work hard,
we will never in the world win the
field-day. I am not expecting a
snap, or anything like it, as some
of the men seem to expect. We
want everybody out there as soon
as possible. A man cannot learn
to run in a day or a month. But
no one can tell me that he cannot
learn to run. It is in every one
somewhere, and all he has to do is
to bring it out. I never have had
more men out than I knew what to
do with."
