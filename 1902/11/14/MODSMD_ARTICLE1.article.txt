# EMBLEMS AWARDED.
## Varsity Subs Presented With Distinctive Insigna.â€”Two Sweaters Withheld. 
### 
At a meeting of the Athletic
Committee last night the men who
have played football on the Varsity
and Second teams were voted
sweaters as a formal recognition of
their services during the past sea
son. The fourteen men who were
awarded the big "S" for services
which culminated in the Intercol
legiate match are: Captain H. S.
Lee, W. B. Barnhisel, C. D. Hauver
man, W. K. Sprott, 11. J. McFad
den, A. R. Dole, M. J. Bartell, G.
11. Clark, 11. P. Magee, L. P. Bans
bach, A. B. C. McGilvray, W. H.
Dole, P. A. Tarpey, E. A. Smith.
It will be remembered that last
year a resolution was adopted by
the Athletic Committee to the effect
that no more than eleven sweaters
be given to the Second team. The
rule was followed by the committee
but an innovation was tried in
voting distinctive sweaters to the
Varsity substitutes. A ruling was
passed that "Varsity substitutes
shall be defined as those men who
wore football uniforms on the side
lines at the Intercollegiate football
game." The sweater which was
voted these men is cardinal with a
German"S,"formerly the insignia of
the Second eleven. In contradis
tinction to the white German "S"of
the Second team, the sweater of the
Varsity substitute will be adorned
with an"S"in black. The men who
were granted this class of sweater
are: K. F. Kennedy, G. C. Jacobs,
H. G. Butterfield, J. J. Monzingo,
W. It. Hamilton, K. F. Cooper.
Only nine sweaters were granted
to the Second eleven. The men re
ceiving them were: W. D. Batter
son, G. A. Scoville, W. B. Doherty,
R. C. Nissen, C. E. Hyde, W. B.
Chandler, H. Shields, R. B. Knight,
C. R. Blodget. The two remaining
Second team players, owing to a
failure on their part to keep train
ing rules, were not granted sweaters.
The eleven men were selected by
the coaches and Captain Lee of the
Varsity and Blodget of the Second
eleven.
The committee concluded its
labors by delegating A. S. Henley,
'04, to confer with the faculty and
the student enthusiasts regarding
rowing possibilities.
