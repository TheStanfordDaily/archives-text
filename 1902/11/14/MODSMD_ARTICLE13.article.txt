The method of apportioning
football sweaters adopted by the
Athletic Committee is significant,
contrasting as it does with the
mode followed in former years.
Two years ago twenty-five men
were granted the privilege of wear
ing the small German S, many
of whom had never lined up with
the Second team. Considerable
dissatisfaction was felt at that time,
the rivalry between the members
of the Second and the Varsity hav
ing been especially strong. Last
year sweaters were distributed in
discriminately with little regard to
whether or no the recipient had
stood by the Team to the
end. The resultant cheapen
ing of the emblem caused
the Athletic Committee to place a
limit on the number of emblems
presented. In the future the "side
S" will be less in evidence than the
big Varsity block. Such limitation
is a just reward for the up-hill fight
of the "Scrub." On him falls the
brunt of each evening's practice.
Hard knocks and bruises and little
glory are his lot. May his emblem
be respected as his efforts deserve.
The fact that the names of two
men who otherwise would have re
ceived the sweater and the privilege
of wearing the "side S" were
stricken from the list is encouraging.
It reflects the attitude of the student
body in regard to training rules,
and like the presentation of a dis
tinctive emblem to Varsity substi
tutes, is a step in the right direc
tion.
