Tiie Saturday Night Club is
once more in a flourishing condi
tion, after a considerable period of
inaction. The membership is in
creasing, and the club as a whole is
doing active and energetic work.
It is the aim of the club not only

to give its members practice in
public Bpeaking, but to make a
profitable study of current events
as well. A symposium on some
topic of the day is planned for one
meeting, to be followed the next
week by a debate on some phase of
the subject, thus requiring each
member of the club to make a thor
ough study of the most important
current events.
Tomorrow night is a "Helen
Hunt Jackson" evening. Miss
Wenceslow of San Jose has prom
ised to be present and give some
personal reminiscences of a visit to
the home of "Ramona." Readings
from the poems of "H. H." and
descriptions of Indian life will be
other features of the program.
All women of the University are
eligible to membership in the club
Visitors are cordially welcome.
