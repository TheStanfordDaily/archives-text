—The Chaparral board met in
53 Encina last night in a business
session and talked over the new or
ganization. A constitution was
drawn up, but beyond this no defi
nite action was taken.
—The Foil and Mask Club met
last evening behind the gymnas
ium, as that building could not be
used on account of there being no
light. Various fencing stunts
were performed in the moonlight
before the Gymnasium Club.
