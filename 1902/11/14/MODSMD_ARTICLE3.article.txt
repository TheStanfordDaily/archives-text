# FOOTBALL FOR 1903.
## Next Season's Outlook as Based on Prospective Material. 
### 
Although the football season of
1902 ended in a defeat for the Car
dinal, it has been far from an un
satisfactory season. Stanford put
in the field this year a team as
strong in many raspects as any
ahat has ever carried her colors.
In a few of the finer points of the
game she was weak, but this weak
ness was so slight that it took the
fiercest intercollegiate game ever
played on the Coast to reveal it.
A glance at the football outlook as
it appeared at the first of the sea
son shows that Stanford has every
reason to be proud of the showing
made. At the opening of the fall
her football squad numbered in its
only four men who entered last
year's intercollegiate contest at the
first call of time. There was scant
Varsity material here and the
second team showed little better
prospects. From this nucelus a
team was developed which was em
inently a Varsity eleven. Beside
this a spirit of unification and co
hesion between student body and
team was developed to an extent
it has seldom reached during the
past decade.
This was accomplished under
the most adverse circumstances;
the outlook for next year is far
brighter. Of this year's Varsity
Lee and Smith are both lost
through the four-year rule, Barn
hisel by graduation, and Hauver
man because he will probably not
return to college next year. This
leaves a break in the center of the
line, where this season it was
strongest. There are, however, a
number of men who should de
velop into Varsity players by next
season. Jacobs andMonzingo both
played strong games at guard this
year; Nissen, Shields, and Christy
are possibilities. The rest of the
team should remain practically
unchanged. It is sure to develop
in strength with a season of work;
and with an average amount of
material in the incoming class of
1907, material for a strong team
is found in abundance. At Berke
ley the loss of veterans is about as
heavy as at Stanford. Captain
Albertson, Hudson, More, and
Mini are graduated at the close of
this year. Yet there is at Cali
fornia a wealth of substitutes.
Stanford's reliance must be on a
development next season which
will enable her to overcome the
lead this year's team at California
possesses over its rival.
When the Varsity of 1903 is
spoken of prospectively two ques
tions at once present themselves,
"Who will be the coaches, and who
the captain?" Three men are
mentioned for next j'ear's cap
taincy, â€” Clark, McFadden and
Bansbach. Each man plays a
strong game, each man is popular,
and each possesses the qualities
which go to make a successful
captain. The election will not be
held until after the Thanksgiving
trip.
