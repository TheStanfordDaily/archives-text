a special committee consisting of
H. J. Edwards, C. D. Dittmar, and
C. K. Studley, chairman, has pre
pared the following resolution:
Resolved, That the sense of this
committee, and also of the student
body as a whole, is expressed when
we declare our deep-seated obliga
tion to the men who were instru
mental in adjusting the question of
amateur standing in the recent case
of Warren Smith. We would men
tion especially Dr. F. Angell, W. M.
Rose, '95, A. C. Trumbull, '94,
Chester Murphy, '00, C. L. Clem
ens, '93, and T. L. McFadden, '00,
also Professor Hawthorne of the
University of Oregon, who ren
dered very valuable service. Wal
ter Rose and Dr. Angell deserve
especial commendation. Both uni
versities should feel deeply grateful
to the impartial committee of nine
teen highminded and able collegi
ans from all parts of the country,
who sacrificed valuable time to sit,
under the chairmanship of F. H.
Wheelan, president of the Univer
sity Club, to try the case.
