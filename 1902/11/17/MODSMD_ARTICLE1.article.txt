# FIRST BASEBALL PRACTICE.
## Small Squad Turned Out Saturday Afternoon for Light Work on the Diamond. 
### 
Captain Brown and a number of
last year's Varsity appeared for the
first preliminary practice of the
season Saturday afternoon. The
weather was ideal for this branch
of college sport, and the diamond
was in excellent shape. Captain
Brown started the candidates at
very light work in throwing and
catching, and after a little exercise
in this manner the infield was
worked on handling easy ground
ers and in developing accuracy in
base-throwing.
So few men came out Saturday
that no idea can be reached as to
how promising is the outlook for
new material in the Freshman
class. There had been no regular
call for candidates. Regular prac
tice began today, and the rest of
the week will see a sizeable crowd of
aspirants on duty.
Besides Captain Brown, there
were out Saturday of last year's
nine Copp, who covered third base,
and Lowenthal, left field. < Trow
bridge and Tritch of the Second
team were also in evidence, and
Sales and VVirt of the Freshmen.
