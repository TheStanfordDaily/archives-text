# ENCINA PLAYS THE HOST.
## The 						Reception of Saturday Evening a Very Successful Social Affair. 
### 
One of the most successful dances
ever held in the Hall was given by
Encina Club last Saturday night.
About one hundred and twenty
five couples threw aside the cares of
college life for the moment, and ac
cepted the club's invitation to what
proved to be an evening of unal
loyed gayety. The club-room had
been skilfully converted for the oc
casion into an enormous parlor.
The effect of curtains artistically
draped to cover the barrenness of
the walls, was varied by masses of
greens hanging from chandeliers,
banked in the enormous open fire
place, and scattered with careless
grace over the unprotected corners.
Yanke's orchestra furnished mu
sic for the dancing, and encores
were repeatedly demanded. Many
of the rooms were thrown open for
the evening, and the refreshments
which were served during the tenth
and eleventh dances were often dis
pensed from tables which had done
study-duty earlier in the day. A
large number of invited guests
joined in the festivities.
The patronesses were Mesdames
Jordan, Branner, Stillman Grif
fin, Green, Cubberley, Duni
way, Adams, Wilbur, Searles,
Cook, Whitaker, Lathrop, Cooksey,
Mathews, Grant, and Misses Ray
and Gardner.
The social committee, which,with
President C. D. Hauverman, was
directly in charge of the arrange
ments, consisted of It. 0. Hadley,
Norman Collyer, and Chester Nar
amore, chairman.
