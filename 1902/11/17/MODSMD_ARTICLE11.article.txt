The Stanford Christian Associa

evening at the adjoining residences
of Dr. Little and Miss Edna Needles
in Palo Alto. The lawns of the two
homes were illuminated with red
lanterns and a cheerful bonfire.
In one house an enjoyable musical
program was carried out, and choc
olate served, while in the other old
fashioned games, unconventional
refreshments, and general fun pre
vailed. Among the features were
Mr. Noyes' selections on the cello,
a whistling solo by Miss Thoburn,
and vocal solos by Dr. Little and
Miss liartlett. The Girls' Glee
Club appeared for the first time
this year, and made a very favor
able impression. The number of
those present was very large. Al
together the entertainment was one
of the most thoroughly enjoyable
of the semester.
