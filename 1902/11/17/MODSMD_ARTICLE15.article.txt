The baseball management is to
be congratulated on again securing
the services of Swindells as coach
for the coming season. A Stanford
man himself and thoroughly in
touch with the spirit of the Uni
versity's athletic policy, he has
proved himself in addition to be
an instructor of the game of un
usual ability. Last season, from
conditions apparently hopeless,
from a squad of the greenest ma
terial, a team was evolved which
all but wrested the championship
from the veteran Californians. The
team was the creation of Swindells.
This year the outlook is satisfying,
and it is eminently fitting that the
coach should be the same whose
efficiency met successfully every
test a year ago. The selection of
Swindells was apparently the only
element needed to ensure a success
ful campaign on the diamond.
