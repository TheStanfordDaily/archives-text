# DEBATE WILL BE EXTEMPORE.
## Need of Differentiating Between Carnot and Intercollegiate Led to the New Agreement. 
### 
In an interview this afternoon
Prof. C. A. Duniway, who, with
Prof. R. M. Alden, constitutes the
Stanford faculty committee whose
conference with the University of
California representatives has re
sulted in the announcement of rad
ical changes in the nature of the
Carnot debate, explained at some
length the reasons on which the
committee's action was based.
Under the new regulations, it will
be remembered, the Carnot is to be
essentially an extempore contest.
"The committee felt that there
was no reason for holding two in
tercollegiate debates, exactly alike,
between the two institutions the
same year," said Dr. Duniway.
"The problem was to differentiate
the Carnot from the Intercollegiate.
"The Intercollegiate gives oppor
tunity for systematic preparation
and thorough team-work in pre
senting a case. It gives more op
portunity for spontaneity and for
the development of readiness of
thought and speech. The Carnot,
on the contrary, should be sponta
neous expression upon a specific
issue, but based upon thorough
-preparation of the general subject
involved. The successful Carnot
debater should be able to make use
of a body of information for presen
tation of an unpremeditated but
sincere issue.
"The regulations for the conduct
of the Carnot in previous years
have encouraged men to elaborate
and to commit to memory two sets
of speeches in preparation for the
emergencies of the allotment of
sides. Last year the announce
ment of the exact question and the
choice of sides three weeks before
the debate, amounted to the aban
donment of the effort to secure
spontaneity.
"It is hoped that the measures
now adopted will be efficacious in
making it necessary for men sim
ply to prepare themselves upon a
general question and then be ready
to face any emergency.
"The fear has been expressed
that a contest of this kind will re
sult in the presentation of unwor
thy speeches. It is said that the
requirements are too severe for the
students of our universities. In the
discussion of this aspect of the
question, the committee felt that
our university men would prove
themselves equal to the demand
made upon them. The slight loss
in logical form and in the use of
language will be more than offset
by the power of natural feeling and
direct address to the immediate
audience."
