# SERMON BY JAPANESE.
## Rev. C. Nakamura Explained Conditions of Thought in Empire at Chapel Yesterday. 
### 
The Rev. C. Nakamura was in
troduced to the audience in the
chapel yesterday morning by Dr.
Jordan as the man who had acted
as interpreter for him when he
spoke, in English, to the people of
Sendai during his visit to Japan.
The subject of the discourse was
"Japanese religious thought of
today." By way of preface the
speaker explained that he was not
used to speaking in English, as he
came to this country only three
months ago. Besides, the English
is a hard language for the Japanese
to learn because of the accent and
the difficulty they experience in
producing the vowel and the loud
"r" sounds. Because of these diffi
culties he expected the audience
might understand only half of what
he had to say. He then explained
conditions of thought in Japan,
under four heads: Socialism, Bud
dhism and Christianity, education,
and liberalism.
Buddhism, said Dr. Nakamura,
is no longer a live religion in Japan.
Of Christians there are about 50,000
Protestants and an equal number
of Catholics. The present high
school system has grown up since
the war with China. The study of
English is compulsory in the boys'
schools and optional in the'schools
for girls. The last few years have
seen what may be called the birth
of the novel in the Empire. Victor
Hugo's"Les iMiserables"has, among
other works, been published re
cently in several forms. One of the
Japanese defects is exclusivenessâ€”
each person is interested only in
his own occupation,to the exclusion
of appreciation for the other arts.
The Japanese lack originality of
thought. They are too busy study
ing the thoughts of others to be
creative. There is a vast difference
between the Japan of thirty years
ago and the present. Then patriot
ism was unknown. People were
loyal to their clans, but not to
Japan. Modern apparel, news
papers, schools, etc., have come in
during this time. The Japanese
look upon America as their next
door neighbor. They also have a
very high regard for Stanford Uni
versity.
