# BASEBALL SQUAD INCREASES.
## Additional Candidates for Varsity Put Through Preliminary Practice. 
### 
The second clay of preliminary
practice saw a much larger crowd
of candidates out in baseball clothes
and better and much more spirited
work. Coach Swindells was pres
ent to survey the array of new
talent, and ho expressed himself as
well pleased with the outlook. He
took no part in the coaching but
contented himself with watching
Captain Brown send the aspirants
through speedy turns at gathering
in hot grounders. Parker, pitcher
last year, was on the diamond for
a few minutes and loosened up his
arm by light throwing. Blake
covered first base and gathered in
some hard chances. The list of
Freshman candidates was enlarged
last night by the appearance of
Dudley, Wirt, Williams and Litt.
Lowenthal, Copp, Dehy, and Tritch
were among the old men who went
through practice. The entire squad
was drilled in easy infield work.
With a few additional days' prac
tice most of the candidates will be
in shape so that regular practice
games can be played. There are
still a few of last year's nine in
college who have not yet come out.
McCiilvray, catcher, is in training
for the Utah football contest, and
will not be able to take part in the
fall work.
