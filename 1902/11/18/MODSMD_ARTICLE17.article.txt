The meeting of 1903 which is to
occur in the chapel at 1:15 tomor
row afternoon should be attended
by every Senior. The Quad finan
ces have simmered down to a
point where it seems safe to say
that the class, in order to make ad
equate preparations for Commence
ment Week, will be forced to resort
to an extra assessment. Gradua
tion, it is true, is several months in
the future, but the problem is a

that the assessment will be levied
tomorrow. The matter is one in
which every Senior is deeply inter
ested and about which he should
be thoroughly informed.
