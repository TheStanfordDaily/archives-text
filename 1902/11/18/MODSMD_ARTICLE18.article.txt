When it is remembered that but
little more than a month ago the
college was in an uproar over the
prospective dedication by the Jun
ior Class of its plug, the present atti
tude of these same Juniors towards
their "distinctive insignia" is amus
ing. Scarce a month of time has
elapsed, yet the glamor seems to
have worn off and the plug has
been generally discarded for the
fedora or the stiff hat. This indif
ference to what should be regarded
as ii peculiar privilege is lament
able. The wearing of the Junior
plug is by far the most dis
tinctive of Stanford customs. It
should not be allowed to die through
the up-springing of artificially
created prejudice. Every man in
the Class of 1904 can do no better
than procure a battered plug, wear
it continually on the quad, and do
everything in his power to retain
a custom which aids in lending
originality to college life at Stan
ford.
