# Training Begins Anew.

### 
Twelve men reported for football
practice last night. Of the four
teen men who played in the Inter
collegiate game all will go to Utah
except Sprott who feels that he
cannot spare the time from hie
studies. Shields, who has been
playing a good game at tackle on
the Second team, will make the
trip as substitute tackle, with Mc-
Fadden and "Guiby" Dole in the
regular positions. Last night's
practice was confined to light signal
work, punting, tackling, and run
ning in of kicks under the direction
of Coach Slakor.
