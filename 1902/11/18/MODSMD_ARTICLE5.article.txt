last meeting the committee investi
gating the manager's accounts pre

proceedings, which showed the class
to be in debt about $400, with -$100
assets. Several of the items had
not been cleared up at the time.

a final statement, which is expected
to differ somewhat from the former
one.
Much interest has been taken in

dollars will have to be raised by
assessment.
Since the last meeting the Treas
urer of the class, R. C. McComish,
