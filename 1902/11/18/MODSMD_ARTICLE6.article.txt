# Royal Italian Band Concert.
## 
### 
All arrangements have finally
been completed with the manage
ment of ElTery's Royal Italian
Band, and they will appear in the
Assembly Hall on the evening of
Wednesday, Nov. 26th. The band
is not new to Stanford audiences,
having scored a great success here
last season. Some reorganization
of the band has been made since
last year. A new conductor has
been secured in the person of the
Cavaliere Emilio Rivela. Rivela
is a graduate of the Royal Con
servatory at Naples, and is a skilled
musical theorist as well as a writer
of prominence, in addition to being
a conductor. Two years ago he
was knighted by the King of Italy
just after he, with the band which
he then conducted, had taken the
first prize in competition with a
number of the prominent bands of
Italy. He is said to be a conductor
of great interpretative power, with
out having any unpleasant man
nerisms.
The band itself is much the same
as last year, the only changes being
the addition of several new soloists,
who were brought from Italy by
Signor Rivela himself. The band
numbers fifty-eight musicians, and
is said to be in even finer condi
tion than Inst year. To those who
heard the band last season this will
sound rather impossible. Among
the most important acquisitions is
Signor Setaro, who is a harpist of
unusual ability.
Tickets for the concert will go on
sale at the Bookstore and at the
I'alace Pharmacy on the morning
of Friday, Nov. 21st, at nine o'clock.
The prices will be fifty and seventy
five cents, all seats reserved.
