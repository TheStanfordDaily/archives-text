# PACIFIC GROVE CONFERENCE.
## Holiday Students' Gathering Will Attract Men of Many Colleges. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Pacific Coast Conference is
one of the four students' gatherings
held each year under the direction
of the International Committee of
the Y. M. C. A. The conference
for the students of Oregon, Wash
ington, Nevada, and California
takes place at Pacific Grove from
December 26th to January 4th.
The program for the ten days is
planned with special reference to
profit and pleasure. Each morn
ing is taken up with four sessions,
while the afternoon is given up to
intercollegiate athletics, recreation,
and expeditions to the Spanish
missions, Del Monte, Monterey,
and other places of interest. A
feature of the morning program is
a platform address by some of the
leading social and religious leader?
of the Coast.
Good-fellowship with the men of
the various institutions is an at
traction which a college man long
remembers, and the opportunity to
compare notes of purposes and
ideals is a rare one. The confer
ence has been spoken of as the
place where a man lives his best
moments and thinks his best
thoughts. Attending the confer
ence is not merely a personal mat
ter. It is essential to a completely
rounded course, but it is also a
matter of University pride. Berke
ley sends between thirty and forty
men each year, and each of the
small institutions of Southern Cal
ifornia usually sends a larger dele
gation than Stanford. This year
it is hoped that the Stanford dele
gation may number thirty repre
sentative men. Already the num
ber of men wishing to go exceeds
the number of last year's delegation.
The total expense for the ten
days, including car fare, is $15.
A prospectus containing further in
formation concerning the confer
ence can be had from any one of
the officers of the Y. M. C. A.
