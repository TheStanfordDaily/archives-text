The fall baseball practice will
afford excellent opportunity for the
coach and captain to size up the
new material to be developed into
a winning nine next spring, in ad
dition to getting the candidates in
good shape for a successful opening
of the season in January. The
comparative scarcity of aspirants
in this branch of athletics is re
sponsible for the well-settled belief
that in the student body there are
many in college now who would
render real service on the diamond
if they could be persuaded to ap
pear. In order to develop a win
ning team it is necessary that there
be unlimited competition. The
Freshmen especially must be im
pressed with the fact that they are
needed on the field, no matter how

little their experience. The medi
ocre players of this year are the
ones to whom we shall look for
creditable achievement after a year
or two of earnest work. Coach, cap
tain, and old players, are enthusi
astic; it is for the newer members
of the student body to join hands
with a will in making the season a
successful one.
