# Notes from California.
## 
### 
Final arrangements have been
made for a game between Cali
fornia and the Perris Indians at
Los Angeles on Thanksgiving Day.
Manager Decoto will take seven
teen men beside the coaches, and a
hard game is expected in view of
the fact that the Indians defeated
Reliance 28-0 last week.
The executive committee at Cali
fornia has voted to* give gold
souvenir footballs to the fourteen
men who played in the Intercol
legiate game, and a sweater with a
gold *'2" worked on it to each of
the fourteen substitutes.
