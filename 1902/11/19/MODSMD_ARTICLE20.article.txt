At the annual meeting of the
American Athletic Union in New
York Monday, M. 11. Liginger of
the Milwaukee Athletic Club was
chosen president, W. B. Hinchman
of San Francisco among the vice
presidents, and J. E. Sullivan of
the Knickerbocker Athletic Club
secretary. A board of governors
was chosen, including J. E. Sulli
van, chairman, W. B. Hinchman,
M.de Cota, and Herbert Hauser of
San Francisco.
Among the changes made in the
rules governing athletic competi
tion is the following, relating to
pole-vaulting:
"The height of the bar at the
starting and at each successive ele
vation shall be determined by the
officials. Three tries allowed each
height. Each competitor shall
make an attempt in the order in
which his name appears on the
program. Then those who have
failed shall have a second trial in
regular order, and those failing on
this trial shall take their final trial.
Displacing the bar counts as a try.
A line shall be drawn fifteen feet
in front of the bar and parallel
with it; crossing this line in an at
tempt shall be a balk. Three balks
constitute a try. Leaving the
ground in an attempt shall consti
tute a try. A competitor may
omit his trials at any height, but
if he fails at the next height he
shall not be allowed to go back
and try the height he omitted.
"The poles shall have no assist
ing devices, excepting that they
may be wrapped or wound with
any substance for the purpose of
affording a firmer grasp, and may
have one spike at the lower end.
No competitor shall, during his
vault, raise the hand which was
uppermost when he left the ground
to a higher point on the poles; nor
shall he raise the hand which was
undermost when he left the ground
to any point on the pole above the
other hand.
"Ties.â€”ln case of a tie the offi
cials shall raise or lower the bar at
their discretion, and those compet
itors who have tied shall be allowed
one trial at each height. In han
dicaps where a tie occurs, the
scratch man, or man with the
smallest account, shall be given the
place."
