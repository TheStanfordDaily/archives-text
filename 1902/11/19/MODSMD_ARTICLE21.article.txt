# California's Mining Building Begun.
## 
### 
An enormous crowd gathered in
the rain at Berkeley yesterday to
witness the laying of the corner
stone of the Hearst Memorial Min
ing building. President Wheeler
delivered the address and ex-Presi
dent Martin Kellogg the invocation.
The mortar was spread by Mrs.
Hearst, VV. R. Hearst, President
Wheeler and Architect Howard.
The building is to be of granite and
will rank with those of the best
mining schools of the country.
