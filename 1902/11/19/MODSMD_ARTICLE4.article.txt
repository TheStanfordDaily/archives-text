The Knickerbocker Concert Com
pany is to appear in an engage
ment in Assembly Hall Friday
evening, under the auspices of
University musical people. Among
the features of the program are
solos by Mrs. Bermingham, Mr.
Williams, Mr. Larsen, Mr. Wal
ther, and Mr. Lucy; quartet
numbers by the Knickerbocker
Male Quartet; and readings by
Miss Eskridge. It is seldom that
a reader receives much favor in a
college town, but Miss Eskridge
seems to be an exception, as she has
filled two very successful engage
ments at Berkeley already this sea
son.
The London Telcyraph has the
following to say of Mrs. Berming
ham: ''America has sent us many
acceptable singers, and last night
an addition was made to the list of
these favors. This was Mrs. Lillie
Bermingham, a contralto of that
rich and mellow type that so often
comes to us from beyond the At
lantic. Her voice has warmth and
sympathy in abundance, and it
would be difficult to imagine a
listener so constituted as to miss its
undoubted charm."
Mr. Bernard Wallher, the violin
ist, is a musician of note, having
appeared in all the large European
citics, and recently toured Austra
lia.
Seats are now on sale at the
Bookstore at 50, 35, and 25 cents.
