There have been posted in Roble
Gymnasium rules regulating cuts
which place the work soundly upon
the laboratory basis of three hours
each week throughout one semester
for one hour of credit toward grad
uation. This implies the satis
factory completion of a certain
number of working hours for the
semester. The nature of gymna
sium work makes it advisable that
systematic exercise be planned and
regular attendance required.
Ample opportunity, however, will
be given for making up unavoid
able absences, which must be re
ported at once and made up within
one week after the name of the
absentee has been posted in the
weekly list of "unexplained ab
absences."
