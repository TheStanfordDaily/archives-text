# UNIVERSITY ASSEMBLY.
## Professor Smith and Fairfax H. Wheelan Addressed Great Audience This Morning. 
### 
This morning at the fourth hour;
the students and faculty gathered ,
for the second University Assembly.,
As the first "Rah! rah! rah!" of the
yell burst forth, Dr. Jordan, Cor
nell '72, Mr. F. H. Wheelan, Har
vard '80, and Professor A.W.Smith,
Cornell '78, came on the stage.
After the singing of Larrey Bow
man's "One, Two, Three, Four"
Professor Smith was introduced as
the first speaker. »'•'
"At the last Assembly," said
Professor Smith, "we listened to
Professor Farrand. I liked his
talk, but felt that 'there were 'Inany
things that had not been revealed
to him in one year at Stanford.
He told us what we ought to do at
the football game—and we did it.
Ours was a demonstration of the
finest college Spirit I have ever
seen anywhere.' But a -Yesponse of
this kind does not come without
some basis to worlt on. University
spirit is not all yelling, all athletics.
There is a hidden, deeper - spirit,
which is yet stronger." •»
In explanation of his point
Professor Smith' Recalled the early
days of the University and the
winning of the great Stanford suit:
"When the bus man brought the
news to the qu'ft'd the classrooms
were emptied * like a- bucket of
water turned upside down. Up at
the li,ttle red. postoffice I met a
young woman studeht and when
she heard the news she jumped
straight into the air. I always had
great admiration for her after that.
The occasion vfrais the culmination
of loyal Stanford spirit that did
not fail when the fate of the Uni
versity hung in'the balance. But
there is a quieter University spirit,
evidenced in a love for the place
and a desire to guard „ its good
name every moment of our lives."
The speaker touched on the early
intimate relations between students
and faculty, and urged the two ele
ments to work together with their
old-time unity. J
The latter part of his tipie Pro
fessor Smith devoted to remarks
relative to the of inter
collegiate boating between Stanford
and He referred to the
recent visit of the president of the
University of California Boating
Association and said that investi
gations of his own liad demon
strated the feasj > the under
taking. Mr. Charles Lathrop,
he announced, has offered to con
tribute $250 toward the enterprise
in case the University goes about
it in a business-like way, He
further dwelt on the position of
rowing as an iiitercollegiate sport
and offered to lend every possible
aid in getting the project Btarted.
Fallowing Professor Smith's ad
dress, which was enthusiastically
applauded, and brief announce
ments by Student Body President
Dittmar, the Glee Club initiated
C. K. Field's new song "The Stan
ford Red," with C. L. Firebaugh,
'04, in the solo part. The song
was admirably sung and met with
popular favor at once.
Fairfax H. Wheelan, president

of the San Francisco University
Club, was the second speaker. Re
ferring in his opening sentences to
the attitude of the Stanford conting
ent at the game as seen by San
Franciscans, Mr. Wheelan pro
ceeded to an irresistibly humorous
review of his own freshman days
at Harvard. Serious again, he
alluded with pride to the later
careers of many of his friends of
the class of '80. One of them was
President Roosevelt, whom the
speaker styled "A true son of Har
vard, and the best example of a
self-made man that I know of."
Roosevelt, he said, had come to
college in 1876 a stripling, physi
cally weak, without the ability to
speak in public, or to write with
excellence. By dint of faithful
serious work he effected self-trans
formation. It is such men as the
President, said Mr. Wheelan, that
the country needs to check evil
tendencies in modern politics and
industry.
Constantly in the course of his ad
dress Mr.Wheelan was interrupted
by applause, and at the close his
eloquent and effective appeal for
the active . preparation by young
men for the duties of higher citizen
ship brought forth three rousing
cheers "for Wheelan," three"for
Harvard, and a "skyrocket for
President Roosevelt."
The exercises closed with the
singing of "Hail, Stanford, Hail."
