The Princeton Aluvmi Weekly«
edited by Jesse Lynch Williams,
has the following in its issue of
November 15th apropos of the
University Assembly:
At Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity President Jordan recently
issued a proclamation to the
students and faculty to the effect
that on every other Wednesday at
a designated hour all curriculum
pursuits would be suspended, lab
oratories closed, and gymnasium
work abandoned while the whole
university, professors as well aB
students, would meet in Assembly
Hall for a social hour to be given
up to singing, cheering and general
"getting together"—the purpose be
ing to generate more Stanford
spirit. The bi-weekly meetings
also include an address by some
one worth listening to, but this fea
ture seems to be inserted merely as
an added inducement to getting to
gether. The Daily Palo Alto
says editorially that this "is the
result of the energetic work of
Professor Max Farrand ['92],0f the
History department, whose reputa
tion on the Pacific Coast is not con
fined to his department. College
spirit is as much his specialty as
history, and he recently addressed
the students at Berkeley also on
this subject. In his case it means
Princeton spirit.
