Signal work, tackling, and run
ning in of punts is the outline of
the work the Varsity squad has
Ween undertaking the past week.
No scrimmages have been held, the
idea heing more to keep the men in
good shape than to give them either
new formations or experience in
actual playing. Slaker has con
tinued his work as coach, so that
when Stanford lines up against the
heavy Utah eleven she will have
advanced materially in knowledge
of the game and unity of team
work.
It looks as if the personnel of the
squad which will make the Eastern
trip will be changed from the one
originally contemplated. Neither
Sprott nor "Guiby" Dole will be
able to go. Both men feel that
they can not spare the time from
their college work which this en
forced absence would necessitate.
George Clark, the veteran end, may
stay at home, also, to do some hard
studying. In the places of these
men, the players who were on the
side-lines in the big game as Var
sity subs, will make the trip.
Shields is sure of a place at tackle,
while Butterfield at end and Jacobs
in the line seem the most plausible
men for the substitute positions.
