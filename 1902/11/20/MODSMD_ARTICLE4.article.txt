# LECTURE ON SAMOA.
## Crowded Chapel Heard Dr. Jordan Tell of Southern Islands Last Night. 
### 
To hold the crowd that gathered
last night to hear President Jordan
the chapel should have been en
larged to double its capacity. Seats
were filled and several tiers of
people standing when the address
commenced and late comers were
resolved into an overflow meeting
in the facade. "Samoa" was the
theme of the lecture, which was
based on the personal experiences
and observations of Dr. Jordan on
his recent trip to the islands.
In the Pacific, said the speaker,
there are two kinds of islands, lava
and coral. Of the latter class is
Samoa. The islands are four in
number, lying 2000 miles from
Honolulu and constituting the
western end of a submerged moun
tain chain. Upolu, whose prin
cipal city is Apia, Stevenson's
former home, is covered with dense
timber on the upper part and with
coacoanut trees near the coast.
The chief industry is cocoa
nut production. Tutuila, the new
American possession, is one-half
as large as Upolu, and consists of
two high mountains with a deep
crater between, into which the sea
enters and forms the best harbor
in the islands.
Dr. Jordan explained at some
length the natural history of the
archipelago. The flora of the re
gion is replete with many curious
plants. And among the insects is
a mosquito which burrows into
human flesh and causes the pecu
liar aflliction, elephantiasis. It was
a part of the work of Professor
Kellogg to investigate this disease
and discover if possible some pre
ventative. Another phenomenon
is a giant crab which can climb a
cocoanut tree one hundred feet
high.
The Samoan people, said Presi
dent Jordan, are very religious.
They attend church ordinarily
seven times every Sunday. Their
mode of life is communistic. No
body gets ahead, because there is no
individual incentive. In an inter
esting way the speaker brought out
the characteristics of the people by
the relation of personal experiences
and incidents of his intercourse
with them. In some detail he
described the national ceremony of
kava-drinking, presided over by
the village belle.
Of the native Samoans Dr. Jor
dan spoke in highest terms. There
is primitive, indigenous human
nature —real humanity — among
them, he declared. Reviewing
their history, he spoke of the up
rising of Mataafa, whom be styled
as "every inch a king." He was the
natural monarch, but England,
Germany, and the United States
got control, and he became vice
king. The relations of the various
parties were never cordial; there
was a conspiracy every day, Eng
land and the United States gen
erally standing together, Germany
supporting a rival claimant. The
complications which ensued Steven
son was active in straightening
out, but finally the great hurricane
of March, 11)00, dashed many of the

warships to pieces on the reefs and
averted actual hostilities.
The recent award of King Oscar
of Sweden President Jordan held to
be absolutely just; America and
England were unquestionably in
the wrong in their policy toward
the islands.
The lecture ended with a brief
sketch of Stevenson's sojourn in
Apia and the effective part he took
in the affairs of the natives. At
the close Dr. Jordan made passing
comments on many stereopticon
pictures portraying characteristic
Samoan scenes.
