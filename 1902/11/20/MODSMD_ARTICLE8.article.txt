No clearer evidence could be
desired that the students do not
know the college 6ongs than the
shabby manner in which "Hail,
Stanford, Hail" was handled at
the Assembly this morning. It is
really deplorable that such verse
as those which the University is so
fortunate as to possess in ,< One >
Two, Three, Four," and "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," should not be
known from start to finish by every
student. The ability to shout lustily
on the chorus is not enough; the
full volume of eound merely throws
into relief our pitiful ignorance of
the verses themselves. The remedy
is frequent singing, and singing of
every verse. It is capable of general
application.
