Apropos of Mr. W heel a n's re
marks on the higher citizenship
yesterday, a reflection or two con
cerning the variety of politics that
occasionally crops out among Stan
ford undergraduates may not seem
wholly impertinent, especially
since they apply to the forthcoming
contest for the Senior presidency.
Student politics, to justify their be
ing, must be governed by the senti
ment that they shall be so open as
to admit of the closest scrutiny.
Willingly and willfully to preju
dice any voter for or against a can
didate before the merits of his
rivals can be exploited, smacks of
"professionalism," which men and
women of university training are
commonly credited with avoiding.
That there is an element in any
student body whose votes may be
swerved rather easily with proper
manipulation, would be idle to
deny. But to take advantage of
such a condition merely because it
exists illy accord with the dignity
presumably attached to a candi
date for an important class office.
Glad hands of Senior candidates
are already out in force. Early
announcement is perfectly justi
fiable, but only in so far as it be
tokens a desire on the part of the
aspirants to allow voters to become
acquainted with their qualifications
for the position they hope to fill.
Like "Chappie" the Daily Palo
Alto hopes to see the day when
the pledging of votes before elec
tion shall be properly cried down.
It will be to the lasting credit of
the class of 1903 if it takes a stand
for student politics that are square
and openâ€”indicative of the men
and women who represent and
those who are represented.
