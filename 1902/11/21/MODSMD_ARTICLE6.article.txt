# Lecture on Liquid Air.
## 
### 
On the sixth of December the
Assembly Hall will be the scene of
an interesting lecture on liquid air
replete with parodoxical experi
ments. Mr. Thearle is to present
in a scientific but amusing manner
the contrast in temperatures of
which this dry liquid permits. The
apparatus is new, and the unfamil
iar will be given a chance to exam
ine its workings, both during and
at the conclusion of the lecture.
