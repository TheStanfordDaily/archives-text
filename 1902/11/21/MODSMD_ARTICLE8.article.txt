ular meeting last night was enter

college of this art, was the instruct
or. Chiba is a master of the fourth
rank, the second from that of
the champion, which includes about
fifteen men from all Japan. He
taught for some time in a Japanese
college, and intends to enter the
University soon. A strict rule of
the order .demands that the art
shall be taught only to the edu
cated and to those who will not
put it to an evil use.
Michitaro Sindo, '03, gave a
brief description of the art. The
"Judo" was originated some two
hundred years ago in the most
turbulent period of Japanese his
tory. The original purpose was
to enable a combatant to continue
fighting even should he be deprived
of his weapon. Now there is added
to this idea of self-defense the in
tent of making the "Judo" an im
portant branch of physical culture.
The essential requisite of the art is
perfect self-control, so that an an
tagonist may be overcome by his
own strength.

low-countryman, showing the dif

ited ten or fifteen straight holds, of
which he said there are two hun

exhibition with the Japanese, he
