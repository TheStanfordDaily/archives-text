The book "Straws" (Chances for Women to
Make Money) "isfullof suggestions and of hard
facts," said Marion Harland recently: "I wish
I could put a copy of it into the hand of every
woman who has her living to make and is at a
loss how to go about It. Send for it and learn
more from reading three pages than I could tell
you by writing thirty."
