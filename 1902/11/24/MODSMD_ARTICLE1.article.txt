# OFF FOR SALT LAKE.
## Football Squad Leaves to Meet the University of Utah Eleven. 
### 
The football squad was given an
enthusiastic send-off as it left the
campus this afternoon by a small
number of students gathered at the
Training-house. Fifteen men, in
cluding Coach Slaker, left on the
3:06 train for San Francisco, and
took the Overland at 6 o'clock.
Those who compose the squad are
Bartell, McFadden, Barnhisel,
Ilauverman, Captain Lee, Magee,
Bansbach, Tarpey, Smith, W.
Dole, McGilvray, Butterfield,
â€¢Jacobs, and Shield*. Of the men
who played California on the Bth,
Guiby Dole, Clark, and Sprott are
the only ones who will not be in the
tine-up on Thanksgiving. These
men remain voluntarily.
Salt Lake will be reached at 8:30
on Wednesday morning. Few
long stops can be counted on to
give the players a chance to lim
ber up, but short waits for chang
ing engines will be used for brisk
exercise. Opportunity for light
practice will be available at
Truckee, Reno, Wadsworth, and
Echo. The only long stop comes
at Ogden early Wednesday morning.
During their stay at Salt Lake
the team will be quartered at the
Knutsford Hotel. Manager Ed
wards is already there making
arrangements for the game.
Returning the team will leave
Salt Lake Saturday morning and
will arrive in 'Frisco Sunday
night, reaching the University that
night or Monday morning.
Altliough no Stanford men ex
cept the team took the trip there
will be an organized rooting sec
tion, decked with cardinal and cry
ing the Stanford yells, when the
team plays Utah on Thanksgiving
Day. A student in the high school
of the City of the Saints has writ
ten Waldemar Young, '04, an old
schoolmate of his, asking for the
Stanford yells, ami reports that
with these in their possession the
high school boys will turn out
eight hundred strong to cheer the
team to victory.
