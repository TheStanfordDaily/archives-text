Much color was lent to the out
look for a successful track season
by the meet of Saturday. Al
though the athletes were not urged
to exert themselves to the utmost,
the majority of the contests were as
warmly contested and as pleasing
to the spectators as a regular spring
meet. Commendation is due the
participants for theenthusiasm with
which they have adhered to fall
training, and gratitude to the cap
tain and coach, whose efforts have
revolutionized the attitude of the
Stanford track man toward his
work.
