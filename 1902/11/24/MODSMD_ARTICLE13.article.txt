The attitude of the football squad
toward the coming contest with the
University of Utah is gratifying in
view of the feeling that might arise
over a post-season game of this kind.
Every member of the squad is im
pressed with the necessity of rolling
up a big Thanksgiving score, and
the idea that they are going on a
holiday pleasure jaunt has really
been subordinated. The Utah
players are worthy contestants, and
are counting on giving the Califor
nians a hard struggle. There are
many old Stanford men in Utah
who will witness this contest, and
the squad have realized from the
first that a University's reputation
is to be a factor in the game. The
long trip, with its incidental pleas
ures and experiences, is a fitting
reward for the hard and tedious
work that has been the lot of the
football men for the past three
months. It is in the nature of an
expression of appreciation. The
University awaits the outcome with
expectation, but not anxiety. We
know what the team can do, and
feel confident of the outcome.
