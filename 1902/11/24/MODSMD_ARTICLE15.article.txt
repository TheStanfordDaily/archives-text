### 
The California branch of the
Association of Collegiate Alumnae
met at Sorosis Hall in San Fran
cisco Saturday. The morning was
taken up with committee meetings.
At noon luncheon was served to
the sixty-five members present. At
the afternoon meeting Dr. Mary
Roberts Smith, of Stanford, spoke
on ''Philanthropy as a profession
for college women." She described
it as a new and profitable field open
to educated women where advance
ment is rapid and certain, because
workers are as yet too few. Dr.
Leona R. Ash related her "Medical
experiences abroad."
The question of a club-house for
the association came up and met
with enthusiastic approval. It
has been definitely decided to have
a club-house,but details are yet to be
arranged. Meanwhile a tea room
will be established. A request for
subscriptions met with immediate
response, and the committee in
charge will carry out the plan at
once.
The idea of admitting under
graduate women to partial privil
eges of club-house and tea-room is
meeting with earnest support. If
granted, the advantage to students
visiting San Francisco will be
thoroughly appreciated.
