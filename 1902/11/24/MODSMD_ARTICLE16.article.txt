# Head-Master Reid on "Traditions."
## 
### 
At the chapel yesterday morning
William T. Reid, head-master of
Belmont .School, delivered an ad
dress eminently worth hearing.
His subject was "Traditions." The
sermon was intended to place the
phases of college life before the
young men of the University in
their true relations.
"It lies with the young men of
Stanford,'' said Mr. Ileid, "to de
termine the traditions that shall
echo down her corridors. The
spirit that should animate Stanford
is loyalty to conscience. Every
community is responsible for what
takes place in it. The spirit of
Stanford is not in favor of stealing
signs to decorate rooms; if such
theft is a virtue, horse-stealing is a
still greater virtue. Students are
less excusable for debaucheries and
depredations than others who have
not had their advantages. There
should be such a sentiment for
right-living in the University that
one who violates that tradition
would not be tolerated on the
campus."
