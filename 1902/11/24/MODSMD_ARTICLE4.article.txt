# A 						SATISFACTORY MEET
## Saturday's Handicap Field-day Resulted in Close Contests.—Much Interest Shown. 
### 
Saturday's handicap field-day,in
the performance of the competitors
and in the attendance, showed a
marked increase of interest in track
athletics since the meet a year ago.
It was a day in which a number of
events were closely and creditably
contested. Trainer Moulton and
Captain McCaughern are well
pleased with the results.
The final heat of the 75-yard
dash was one of the closest races,
the four contestants finishing not a
yard apart. Harper's strong finish
in the five-lap run was deservedly
cheered by the bleachers. The 300-
yard was won by Dunn, scratch,
who passed his competitors on the
stretch in a pretty sprint. Gay's
work in the mile promises well for
next semester. Abbott, with one
arm stiff from his recent injury,
