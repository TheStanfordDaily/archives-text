# ROBLE ENTERTAINS FACULTY
## Ford's "Best Laid Plans" Successfully Presented Before Approving Guests. 
### 
The Iloble reception to the Fac
ulty on last Saturday evening was
a success in every detail. The
lower hall was tastefully decorated
with lanterns and greens. The
space between the stairways was
the opera house lobby, where,
around the box-office, were dis
played pictures of Stanford cele
brities. A large frame contained
the photographs of the actors of the
evening.
At seven forty-five the dining
room doors were opened and the
guests were admitted to the"theatre."
Misses Stroud, Harris, O'Brien, lbs,
Garibaldi, Fifield, and Brown
formed a Roble Mandolin Club,
which played an overture. The
curtain rose at eight o'clock.
The farce was a light society skit
adapted from Paul Leicester Ford's
"The Best Laid Plans." Local
touches added interest. Miss Edyth
Hale was a dainty Mrs. Wycherly,
at whose country house is assembled
a party composed of Misses Eliza
beth Yoch, Ruth Seadler, and Sue
Bird in the characters of Helen,
Amy, and Rose, respectively, with
Messrs. Bassett, Duniway, and
Searles as Steven, George, and Den
nis. They are divided in opinion
as to the expected guest, George
Augustus Guelph Dunstan, Earl of
Ferrol and Staunton. The girls
are delighted at the prospect of
meeting aristocracy, and the gentle
men fear a corresponding abate
ment in their own popularity.
They plan a joke by instructing a
mutual friend to personate the
Englishman, arrive before he does,
and deceive the young ladies into
wasting their attentions on the
wrong party. Their plan is dis
covered by the young ladies, who
immediately send for a cousin of
Amy's to play the part, and by
coming earlier, turn the tables upon
the jokers. At an opportune mo
ment the real Lord Ferrol appears,
is mistaken for their ally by both
parties, and as a result undergoes
mystifying experiences. He adds
considerably to his notes on the
peculiarities of Americans. The
conclusion comes as a climax, when
all parties discover their mistake.
Every part was perfectly played.
The presentation was an unquali
fied success.
After the play the guests repaired
to the parlor above, where refresh
ments were served. The time un
til ten thirty passed pleasantly.
