# The Most Popular Books.
## 
### 
For some time the Library has
been gathering statistics to de
termine which books are the most
used. These books cannot be calleed
the most popular, on account of the
conditions governing the choice of
readers. Where the element of
individual choice prevails, the cur
rent magazines are the most read.
But necessity, not choice, prevails,
hence Ransome's "History of Eng
land" was first in point of circula
tion during the past week, followed
by Traill's "Social England" and
Green's "Short History." Then
came Goldsmith's "Vicar of Wake
field" and Walpole's "Castle of
Otranto." Ninth and tenth on the
list come the principal education
and economic references.
