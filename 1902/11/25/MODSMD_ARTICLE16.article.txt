The acceptance by the Women's
Athletic Association of the chal
lenge from the University of Cali
fornia women students for a tennis
tournament is the culmination of a
growing interest in the game which
was generated several years ago
but assumed no definite form until
intercollegiate basket-ball was pro
hibited at the advice of the faculty
committees. The activity of the
association this semester has put
women's athletics on a much
firmer basis than heretofore. In
the lloble Gymnasium Club spec
ialization in apparatus work has
been made possible and is being

thoroughly appreciated. The com
ing test of skill with the represen
tatives of our sister university will
be an opportunity for the develop
ment of all that is good in athletic
competition.
The fact that the California
students apparently have worked
up a deal of enthusiam on the sub
ject would naturally point to hope
of taking first honors for Cali
fornia. It is true that throughout
the fall the players at Berkeley
have kept up regular practice on
much better courts than our own.
But if the contestants this side of
the bay enter the lists seriously it
is our belief that success is in
evitable.
