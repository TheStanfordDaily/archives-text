# Trees Threatened with Destruction.
## 
### 
Some of the students of Entomol
ogy are investigating the condition
of the Monterey pines in the Arbor
etum. They find that a large
majority of these have been at
tacked by insect pests so badly that
their death in the near future
seems certain. Of 190 trees, all
the pines growing on two acres,
only three were free from serious
attack. Some of these insects at
tack the needles, stunting them so
that practical defoliation of the
tree results. Others, even more
dangerous, work under the bark
near the base of the trees. These
pests often completely girdle the
tree, death then being certain.
Similar trouble is being found
among the Monterey pines of the
Monterey and Pacific Grove re
gions. Serious effort must be made
to tight these pests,for the complete
destruction of the Monterey pine is
threatened.
