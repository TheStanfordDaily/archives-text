# Palo Alto Football.
## 
### 
Although the Varsity will play
in Salt Lake and the Second eleven
in Carters on Thanksgiving Day,
there will be a football game in
Palo Alto which ia certain to be a
battle royal. The town has been
divided into the "north side" and
the "south side," each with a team
whose ranks comprise men of ex
perience, of weight, and of muscle.
Thursday afternoon the rival
elevens will meet on the gridiron to
determine the town championship,
the proceeds of the match to be
given to the Woman's Club.
