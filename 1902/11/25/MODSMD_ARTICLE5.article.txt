# ROYALTY VISITS STANFORD.
## Crown Prince of Siam and Suite Spend a Few Hours on the Campus. 
### 
Stanford was visited by ancient
and absolute monarchy today in
the person of His Royal Highness
Maha Vajiravudh, Crown Prince of
Siam. With his suite he arrived
on the noon train and was imme
diately taken in charge by Presi
dent Jordan. After a short drive
around the campus the titled vis
itor was driven to the Delta Upsi
lon house, where he took lunch and
was given an opportunity of hear
ing the Stanford songs. He was
afterward taken on an extended
visit to the University buildings,
inspecting in turn the Memorial
Church, Encina and Roble, and
the Museum.
The Prince was accompanied by
his aid-de-camp, Mom R. Anuva
tra, his private secretary, the Siam
ese minister to Washington, Pro
fessor J. H. Gore of the Columbian
University at Washington, and
L. C. Wheeler and R. 11. Taylor,
two oflicers of the United States
secret service, who have been de
tailed to look after the personal
safety of his highness.
This representative of Oriental
royalty and heir apparent to the
throne of Siam is nearly at the end
of his tour of the United States.
From San Francisco he will journey
to the north, making several short
stops before arriving at Vancouver,
from which place he sets sail for
Siam December 4th. He has vis
ited all the important cities on his
tour, and formally inspected many
industries. He has collected much
valuable information to use in car
rying out needed reforms in the
Siamese methods of commerce
and manufacture.
Maha Vajiravudh is in build
short and stocky, and although of
a diminutive size, is athletic. He
is only about twenty-two years old,
and graduated from Oxford recent
ly. His preparatory work was
completed at the Sandhurst Mili-
School, and owing to the fact
that the English were rushing
students through in order to
make them available for service in
the Boer War, the Prince was en
abled to finish his course quickly.
Being an Oxford man, he possesses
all the polish and refinement
which such an education gives. On
his way to California he visited
West Point.
He has expressed himself as
highly pleased with California. Its
climate, he said, is very similar to
that of his native country. He
grew very enthusiastic over Stan
ford, and gave expression to his ad
miration of the Memorial Church.
The Prince was struck with the
beauty of the quadrangle and the
arch."It makes me think of my
old days at Oxford," he said, "when
I studied history and law; only
everything is so much newer here
than there. I am glad to see
science tempered by beautiful art,
as seen in your Church. At Ox
ford I used to think science dull,
but this dullness is relieved by the
beautiful. This high art in your
Church and buildings appeals to
me more than anything I have

seen at Stanford. It has been a
great pleasure to be able to visit
the University."
His Royal Highness and suite
left on the 3:06 train for San Fran
cisco, and this evening M. 11. de
Young, editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle, will entertain him at a
dinner and theatre party.
