### 
Ellery's Royal Italian Band,
which is to appear in Assembly
Hall tomorrow night, will probably
not play here again after that until
1905 or 1906. Mr. Ellery has made
all arrangements for his organiza
tion to make a complete tour of
Europe during the season 1903-4.
The band numbers fifty-five
instrumentalists, and is the largest
now in America. It is under the
direction of the Cavaliere Emilio
Rivela, the only Italian band
master ever in America whose work
in his native country was recog
nized by the King. Victor Eman
uela 111 bestowed upon Rivela the
cross of Savoy and made him a
Cavaliere three years ago after
Rivela's band had won the King's
prize at the national concourse of
Italian bands at Turin. In America
Rivela has been recognized already
as the greatest bandmaster this
country has ever known, and the
present tour of the band is bring
ing forth more enthusiasm than
has ever before been accorded a
musical organization in the United
States. Its wonderful improve
ment since last season is a matter
of surprise to those who heard it
then, for they thought at that time
an organization of the kind could
not be improved upon.
Of the leader the Omaha World
llerald recently said: "As a con
ductor Cavaliere Emilio Rivela
soon demonstrated to the audience
his capabilities, which seemed to
unfold and develop as the program
progressed. He is unpretentious,
but nevertheless authoritative,
quite active at times, and the de
cision of the man is apparent from
the positive effects which he brings
from his band of trained musi
cians."
The Davenport Times said: "It
is perhaps no exaggeration to say
that there was not a moment dur
ing the performance of any num
ber when the audience was not held
spell-bound, which fact speaks for
itself."
