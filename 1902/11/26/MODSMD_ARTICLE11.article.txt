# The
						"Chaparral."

### 
A very creditable number of the
Chapairal appeared today. There
is the usual variety of special
features in picture and verse,among
them "A Correction," "After,"and
"Our Beauty Contest." "To the
Team," by Ike Russell, is good,
and a full-page drawing by Bour
ough, '01, "A Co-educational Op
portunity," takes first rank among
the drawings. The editorials pre
sent the last word on the question
of plug-wearing, Stanford rooting,
and the game.
