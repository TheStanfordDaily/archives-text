A movement is on foot among
men interested in tennis to form
an association for the control of the
game at Stanford. The explana
tion lies in the manifestly unsatis
factory arrangements now in vogue.
Tennis, a student body activity,has
not for years had the student body
behind it, largely because of the
fact that a relatively small num
ber find any great pleasure in the
game in its intercollegiate relations.
Also it is true that the condition of
our courts has not encouraged reg
ular practice. It is certain that
something ought to be done by way
of remedy. Whether an associa
tion entirely separate from student
body control is advisable is hardly
a debatable question. Such a com
bination would rapidly be domin
ated by factional elements. Plow
ever, if there could be formed an
association directly under the con
trol of the Associated Students, in
which, for instance, the athletic
committee should act as executive
committee or board of managers
the sport would be on a much
firmer basis and capable of con
stant improvement.
