# Thanksgiving Football.
## 
### 
The preparations for the big foot
ball game in Palo Alto Thanksgiv
ing Day at 3 p.m. are nearly com
plete. A gridiron has been leveled
on Grace & Dudfield's lumber yard
where before impromptu bleachers
the business men of the north side
will endeavor to down their oppo
nents who work across the street.
Partisanship is rampant, each team
is confident of victory and those
men who were not fortunate enough
to earn a place on the team are de
termined to earn money for the
Women's Club by selling peanuts
or popcorn on the sidelines.
