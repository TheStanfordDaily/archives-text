# Colton to Visit Stanford.
## 
### 
E. T. Colton, the international
secretary of the Y. M. C. A. for the
institutions of higher learning of
the Middle and Pacific West, is to
be at Stanford Saturday of this

week and Monday of next. An in
formal reception will be given Mr.
and Mrs. Colton by the advisory
board of the Y. M. C. A. and the
cabinets of the two Associations at
Dr. Elliott's Friday evening. Sat
urday afternoon a tramp into the
hills and a barbacue will be the
features.
Monday evening Mr. Colton will
give a very informal talk to the
men of Encina in the club-room
immediately after dinner, on some
aspects of college life. At 7:30 he
will give a thirty-minute address
in the chapel to the men of the
Association and all others inter
ested.
Mr. Colton is distinctively a col
lege man. He was captain of his
college football team, and winner
of the State oratorical prize of
Illinois. The president of the Ohio
State University recently said:
"He is a clear, forceful speaker,
worthy of the attention and confi
dence of every college student.''
Mr. Colton's visit to the Univer
sity is primarily in the interests of
the Students' Conference, which
meets at Pacific Grove Dec. 26th to
Jan. 4th, and of which he, as the
Western college representative of
the international committee, is in
charge.
