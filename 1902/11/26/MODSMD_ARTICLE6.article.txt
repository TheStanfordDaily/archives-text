# Y.W.C.A. Meeting.
## 
### 
Mrs. Matzke addressed the Y.W.
C. A. meeting yesterday, on the
"Wholesome Physical Life." Her
two conclusions were: A woman is
capable of as high intellectual de
velopment as a man, but she must
take more time for it; and a college
education is only an incident in a
woman's life, â€”when she ignores
this fact she trifles with her happi
ness.
