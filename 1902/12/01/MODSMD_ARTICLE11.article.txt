# No Wisconsin Game.
## 
### 
Clifford G. Roe, manager of the
Wisconsin University football
team, has been on the Coast for the
past week attempting to make ar
rangements for games with the two
big California teams during the
Christmas vacation. Neither the
Stanford nor California manage
ment will consider the proposition,
owing to the Varsities not wishing
to continue the season. The Wis
consin team will in all probability
not come to the Coast at all.
