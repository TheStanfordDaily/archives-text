It is not alone on the Coast that
the question of holding football
games on or off the college grounds
assumes the nature of a serious
problem, although the conditions
here differ materially from those on
the Atlantic seaboard. Some years
ago Yale, Harvard, and Princeton
played their major games on neu
tral territory in New York and
Springfield. Recent years, how
ever, have seen the matches rele
gated to the college towns. In the
Middle West, Minnesota and Michi

gan have just ended a wordy battle
by choosing Ann Arbor as the scene
of the Thanksgiving contest this
year, and deciding to go to Minneap
olis next season. The Grand Rapids
Press recently commented editor
ially upon this decision, and very
sensibly pointed out some of the
advantages of campus games which
hold for all colleges. The writer
says:
"College games properly belong
on college grounds. Removing them
to larger cities in order to increase
the financial returns tends to re
move them from the strictly ama
teur class. It is a step toward pro
fessionalism. The playing of the
biggest games away from home is
an injustice to the main student
body. Moreover, the practice does
not hold the alumni so closely to
the university as home games would.
The great contests on the college
grounds bring back the old gradu
ates as nothing else can, and fosters
stronger college spirit, and stronger
love for Alma Mater. The neutral
ground college football game is like
an old-fashioned home Thanksgiv
ing day dinner eaten in a city res
taurant. It lacks the one essen
tial—environment —to make it per
fect."
