# Italian Band Concert.
## 
### 
The Royal Italian Band scored
the success of the semester on
Wednesday evening before a good
audience. Those who went expect
ing to be disappointed on account
of the absence of last year's direc
tor, Signor Creatore, found in Riv
ela a competent, dignified leader,
whose control of his musicians was
without the slightest appearance of
sensationalism.
The program throughout was one
long to be remembered, but the
numbers most enthusiastically re
ceived were "The Prizo Song," from
"Die Meistersinger" of Wagner,
played as a trumpet solo by Signor
Palma; the "Hymn to the Sun,"
from Mascagni's opera "Iris"; and
the sextet from "Lucia." The
band responded to repeated en
cores.
The Thanksgiving matinee con
sisted of an entire change of pro
gram, and was quite up to the first
concert. Unfortunately the audi
ence was very small. A notewor
thy encore was the "Water Music,"
composed by Handel for the court
festivals of King George 11.
