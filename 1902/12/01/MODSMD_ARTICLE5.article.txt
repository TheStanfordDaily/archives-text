# STANFORD VICTORIOUS AT SALT LAKE.
## Varsity Scores Thirty-five Points in a Snow-Storm While the Utah Players Make Only Two Touchdowns. 
### 
On Thanksgiving Day,under con
ditions entirely new to Stanford
football players, the Varsity chased
the Utah men from end to end of a
sheet of snow. The field was wet
and slippery, each team suffering
in speed on this account, although
the snow bothered the Cardinal
players mote than their acclimated
opponents. The first half Stanford
had everything her own way. She
scored three times, and two goals
kicked by Lee brought the score to
17 points. It was the perfect in
terference of the Varsity that made
possible the long runs of her backs.
Opposed to Magee in punting was
Bennison, the Utah full-back,
whose long punts were negatived
to a great extent by the ease with
which the Stanford men ran them
in. The interference formed rap
idly and proved invulnerable to
the attacks of the mountain players.
After the complimentary kick-off
of Governor Wells, Stanford made
her first touchdown in short order,
end runs by Tarpey and bucks by
Dole and McGilvray carrying the
ball straight down the field. After
the next kick, McGilvray secured
the ball on a punt on Utah's forty
yard line and by a splendid burst
of speed followed his interference
beyond the goal-posts. The ball
oscillated back and forth for five
minutes before the Varsity carried
it well down into Utah territory.
After losing the ball on downs,
Shields blocked Bennison's kick
and Magee crossed the line for the
third touchdown of the half.
In the second half Utah braced
materially and through a combina
tion of good playing and better
fortune was able to score eleven
points. Their first score was made
by three bucks from the Stanford
seven-yard line after the Utah
kick-off had been fumbled; their
second in almost exactly the same
manner when Zilligan was given
the hall on Stanford's five-yard
line, where the Cardinal had
fumbled, and tore through the line
for the required distance, working
the ball along the line for fully ten
yards, so that the goal was easily
kicked. Stanford 23, Utah 11.
The next touchdown for Stanford
came by a brilliant run in of a
punt from Bennison to McGilvray,
who carried the ball sixty-five
yards to the goal-line. The last
touchdown came a few minutes
later, the final score being Stanford
35, Utab 11.
In the intervals between downs
the Stanford players amused them
selves snowballing each other, an
experience entirely new to several
of the Californians.
The rooters were ]uicked in the
main grandstand and there were
about an even number of Stanford
and Utah supporters. The Salt
Lake JTerald in commenting on the
cheering says,"From whence
sprang the vast number of admir
ers of California nobody knew or
attempted to ascertain. Hut they

were there, with the cardinal fly
ing triumphantly overhead."
The work of the Stanford team is
described by the Salt Lake papers
as the best ever witnessed on a
Utah gridiron. Captain Brown
said after the contest that "Stan
ford knew too much football for us
and that is why they won." Cap
tain Lee was a little disappointed
over Utah's scoring, as he expected
Stanford's goal not to be crossed.
The trip was in every way a suc
cess, barring only the finances,
which on account of the storm did
not aggregate aB large a sum as
had been expected. Stanford will
come out about even. The men
were greeted with outstretched
hands and everything possible was
done for their comfort and pleasure.
Receptions were held at the Uni
versity Club, Elks' Club, and Com
mercial Club, and a special dance
was arranged by the University of
Utah. Throughout, the Utahans
were cordial and hospitable, and
their good will was thoroughly ap
preciated by the visitors.
