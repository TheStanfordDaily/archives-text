# Thanksgiving Football in Palo Alto.
## 
### 
Palo Alto celebrated Thanksgiv
ing with a football game the like of
which never was on sea or land.
The match was a benefit for the
Woman's Club, and for philanthro
py's sake two dozen ordinarily
staid and decorous business men
donned the regulation gridiron
armor and plunged through fifty
minutes of football that put to
shame Stanford's best efforts. The
whole town joined in the post
prandial excitement, organized two
rooting sections and cheered vocif
erously for the players who repre
sented respectively the south and
north sides of University avenue.
Spectacular fumbles were contrib
uted by each eleven, and during
the interval Dr. B. F. Hall and
Postmaster Merguire peddled pea
nuts along the sidelines. The
North Side finally secured a touch
down, the only one of the match.
The Woman's Club netted $200.
