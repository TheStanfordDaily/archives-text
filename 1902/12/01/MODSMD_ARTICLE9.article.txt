# SECOND DEFEATED CARTERS.
## Royal Reception at the Tuolumne Mining Camp.â€”Score 32-0. 
### 
The hospitality with which the
Stanford players were greeted dur
ing their Thanksgiving trip at Car
ters in Tuolumne county was un
limited. The town was literally
placed at the disposal of the Stan
ford men. They were quartered in
the best hotel, two dances were
given in their honor, local talent
excelled itself in a football show at
which the eleven were interested
spectators. The business men of
the town formed an impromptu re
ception committee and cared for
the college men.
The match was not so hard as
had been anticipated. Although
the Cartersites lacked neither spirit
nor brawn they were deficient in
a knowledge of the finer points of
the game. The Second eleven was
able to score three touchdowns in
each half with comparative ease.
Tucker did the kicking for Stan
ford, and his punts were high and
long. Behind the line Doherty was
the most successful of the backs in
eluding the vigilance of the Carters
ends, making several long runs
which contributed materially to the
Stanford score. Scoville and Ham
ilton played hard games and either
could be called upon with safety
when a yard or two was needed.
The line as a whole put up an in
vincible -front. Throughout, the
miners were unable to carry the
ball into Stanford territory.
Bartlett, Carters' left half, made
some good end runs and bucked the
line for several gains. McLaine
punted well for the home team,and
Gable played a fierce game.
Stanford's line-up was as follows:
Knight le, Christy It, Crawford,
1 g, Nissen c, Merrill r g, Hyde r t,
Tucker, Chandler r e, Doherty r h,
Scoville 112 b, Hamilton, Patterson
1 h, Blodgett q b.
