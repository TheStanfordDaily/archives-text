# SECRETARY COLTON'S ADDRESS.
## "American University Tendencies" the Y.M.C.A. Leader's Theme. 
### 
E. T. Colton, international secre
tary of the College 1 Y.' M. C. A.,
spoke last night in the chapel on
the prevailing tendencies in Amer
ican universities. The tendency
toward higher scholarship, he s:iid,
is showing itself in the growing de
mand for college-trained men to till
the positions of trust in the great
business houses of the country.
This is simply an indication that
college men are an ever-increasing
factor in the development of the
country.
Another tendency is toward ath
letics. In the international games
held at Paris last year American
college men took eighteen first
places out of twenty-six. The
growth of American college ath
letics is also shown by the contest
at Mott Haven, between Yale and
Harvard on the one side, and Cam
bridge and Oxford on the other, in
which the Americans captured six
out of the nine event√ü.
A third tendency is the ever
increasing activity toward moral
and religious life. The speaker
mentioned a number of college ath
letes who are identified with the
Christian Associations. Among
the number were Frantz of Har
vard, president of the Association
there; McCracken of Pennsylvania,
now general secretary at Columbia;
the track captain at Yale, now
president of the Association there;
and several others from Wisconsin,
Michigan, and Minnesota. Em
phasis was placed on the impor
tance to students of devoting some
time to spiritual things, in order to
be full-rounded men.
Professor Alden, who presided at
the meeting, spoke of the attitude
of the Pennsylvania men in refus
ing to participate in Sunday games
at Paris. Dr. Little of Palo Alto
sang two solos.
