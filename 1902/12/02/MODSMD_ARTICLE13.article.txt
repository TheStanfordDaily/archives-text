The visit of Ernest Colton to
Stanford and his address in the
chapel last night were events whose
importance should rightly have
met with general recognition.
There are occasions when a visitor
speaking on a purely religious
topic could not expect to command
an audience embracing all the
divergent elements of a university's
life. 13ut last night's assembly was
not of such a type. A college
man there spoke to college men on
matters of general concern. Mr.
Colton's talk was based on the
broad principle of student fellow
ship which always ensures a bond
of common interest. Yet his audi
ence was about one-fifth as large as
he had a right to expect. The
work of the international college
secretary of the Young Men's
Christian Association is of itself
vvorthyof our respect. To its further

ance Mr. Colton brings a person
ality as an individual and a college
man which has made him famous.
The letting slip of an opportunity
such as that of last night is regret
table.
