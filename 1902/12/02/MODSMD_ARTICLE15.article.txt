# Mrs. Stanford Returning.
## 
### 
Mrs. Stanford left New York Sat
urday in her private car and ar
rived in Chicago Sunday. The
date of her departure from there
cannot be learned at present but it
is probable that she will arrive on
the campus the latter part of this
week or the first of next. Whether
Dr. Heber Newton is accompanying
her is not known, but as that was
the intention when Mrs. Stanford
went East in November the pastor
of the Memorial Church may be
expected to arrive with her.
Nothing is being done in regard
to the dedication exercises of the
Church, and definite arrangements
cannot be announced until Mrs.
Stanford's return.
