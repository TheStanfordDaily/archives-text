The financial result of tlie benefit
given by the Sophomores for re
building the tennis courts was very
satisfactory. At the meeting of the
committee this afternoon the re
ceipts of the minstrel show were
shown to be $361.13 with an ex
penditure of $117.26, leaving a sur
plus of $243.87. This balance will
be the nucleus of the five or six
hundred dollars needed to build the
courts. How the remainder will
be raised is undecided.
The Sophomores will repeat the
show next Saturday in Nortree Hall,
Palo Alto, with a complete change
of program. The proceeds will go
to the I'alo Alto high school.
