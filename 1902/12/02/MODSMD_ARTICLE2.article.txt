## 
### 
Two weeks ago Dr. Jordan spoke
in the chapel on the Samoan Is
lands before an enthusiastic audi
ence, which filled the doors and
reached out into the arcades.
Many were unable to hear the
sneaker, or see the slides, which
formed a very considerable element
of interest. Before the Thanksgiving
recess Dr. .Jordan promised to re
peat the address, and tomorrow
night there will be an opportunity
for those who did not hear him last
time to learn of his personal experi
ences, and his general views of
Samoa. The lecture will begin at
7:30 in the chapel.
