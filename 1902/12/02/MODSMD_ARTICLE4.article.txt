# JAPANESE ART AT STANFORD.
## Four Representative Figures Set Up in the Memorial Court. 
### 
The work of setting up the Japa
' nese bronzes in the Memorial Court
was finished today. The most
striking figure is that in the north
east corner of the court, which rep
resents an eagle resting on a vine
covered stump, trying with out
spread wings and open beak to
drive off a number of monkeys
which are clambering about the
base. The whole thing was cast in
one piece, and the details laborious
ly worked out with a chisel. This
represents the modern school of
Japanese art. The figure is the
same that has rested since last
summer on the cairn of stones be
tween the Chemistry building and
the Museum.
The Japanese pagoda supported
by elephants has been removed
from the east side of University
avenue to the northwest corner of
the court. This piece was evident
ly intended for some Buddist tem
ple. According to the Buddhist
scriptures, the elephant and the
lion are sacred animals. The lotus
is the sacred flower which is worn
as a crown by Buddha.
A group of six elephante support
a lotus flower, out of which has
grown a pagoda. Four dragons—
symbols of power—guard the doors
of this pagoda, and doves—symbols
of peace—rest on its roof. The
work bears the seal of a Shogun,
and is undoubtedly a good sample
of early Japanese art.
The two vases on the south side
of the court are such as used to be
found in the temple gardens
throughout Japan. They are
covered with minute Buddhist
designs, many of which cannot be
now interpreted. The vases are
similar, and a description of one
answers for both. Each is divided
laterally into three sections, repre
senting the Buddhist idea of
heaven, the earth, and hell.
Resting on a base ornamented
with relief work are two devils and
two dragons supporting the earth,
and there are, too, a number of tur
tles, which are emblematic of eter
nity.
Guarded on either side by the
god and goddess of creation is the
earth. A series of reliefs present a
curious mixture of scenes from Jap
anese history and Buddhist tradi-,
tions. Heaven is above, guarded by
lions with elephants' trunks. The
bird of paradise is here depicted,
and angels with drums and trum
pets.
In answer to criticisms of the
figures of animals on the vases it
may be said that Buddhism came
ready-made from India. Its sym
bols are, therefore, Hindu, and the
Japanese artist labors under the
disadvantage of representing ani
mals that he has never seen.
The vases not only bear the Sho
gunate seal, but also the imperial
crest —a rather incongruous com
bination.
Such figures in Japan are sur
rounded by terraced lawns, and
waving trees, and arching roofs.
Thus it is impossible to give the
true artistic effect to the group in

its present position—this from the
Japanese standpoint.
The two vases were odered built
a hundred years ago by a wealthy
family near Kyoto. They were in
tended as a contribution to a tem
ple, but it was predicted that
calamity would result from the
gift. Ho they were disposed of, and
after passing through the hands of
several families of note they were
secured by the collectors, Ikeda &
Co., in Tokyo, from whom Mrs.
Stanford obtained them.
