A meeting of the Students' Guild
was held last night at the home of
Dr. Snow. President J. S. Bur
cham appointed Professor Sanford
and Miss Tarbell, '08, as a commit
tee to secure the services of nurses
for Guild members when needed.
Dr. Snow and Miss Kip were
authorized to purchase four sick
room outfits. Dr. Snow was dele
gated to purchase some simple rem
edies, which will be distributed
among members of the organiza
tion. Plans for a hospital and a
Guild drugstore were discussed.
An unknown friend of the asso
ciation donated $100 to the work
of the Guild. A vote of thanks
was extended the donor.
