# Wonders of Liquid Air.
## 
### 
On next Saturday night in As
sembly Hall, W. B. Patty will give
experiments with liquid air. The
audience will be given nearly two
hours of experience in the labora
tory of a scientist, and that scien
tist a most adept manipulator of
the most wonderful agent of recent
discovery. To see the invisible and
intangible atmosphere reduced to a
dense, bluish liquid, possessed of
many wonderful properties; to see
the operator plunge his hands
without harm into a substance 312
degrees below zero; to see steel
burning in this fluid with the
brilliancy of fireworks, strawber
ries in the same fragile dish mean
time being frozen into icy bullets;
to see a kettle of liquid air violent
ly boiling on ice, —these and many
other paradoxes are better than
tricks or legerdemain.
Liquid air in general appearance
is like water, if poured on the
floor or on ice it flies steaming
from it like water from a red-hot
stove, and is quickly transformed
into ordinary air. A kettle of
liquid air, if set on a gas stove, be
comes at once coated with ice, even
right over the flame. The ice does
not melt, no matter how hot the
flame, as long as there is sufficient
liquid air in the kettle. Alcohol,
which freezes at a temperature of
202 degrees below zero, becomes
solid if brought into contact with
liquid air.
Raw beefsteak, potatoes, hollow
rubber balls, rubber tubing, and
other elastic substances will be
frozen to the hardness and brittle
ness of glass, and will be shattered
as easily as so many lamp chim
neys. A bunch of roses is dipped
into the fluid, and, while apparent
ly unaffected by the frosty bath,
crumbles like tiny icicles when the
hand passes over them. Nails are
driven with a hammer made of
frozen mercury, and many other
experiments quite as marvelous are
shown.
The advance sale has been very
good, both here and in Palo Alto.
Tickets are on sale at the Book
store and at the Palace Pharmacy
in Palo Alto. Prices 50 and 75
cents.
