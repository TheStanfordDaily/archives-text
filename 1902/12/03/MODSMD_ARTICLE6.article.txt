# Work in Practical Philanthropy.

### 
The department of practical
philanthropy, recently organized
by the Y. W. C. A., has been doing
considerable work of late. Just be
fore the Thanksgiving vacation,
a large amount of clothing and
books was collected. To the City
and County Hospital of San
Francisco, whose patients, for lack
of clothing, are often detained after
the time for their discharge has ar
rived, one hundred and forty
pieces of clothing were sent. Un
derwear is particularly needed, as
is also old muslin and linen for
hospital use. To the California
Girls' Training Home, where rescue
work for girls from nine to fourteen
years of age is done, one hundred
and thirteen pieces were sent. To
the Salvation Army Headquarters,
where, in the spirit of real charity,
nothing is given away, but every
thing sold at merely nominal prices,
forty-two pieces were sent. Boxes
of reading matter were sent the
Seaman's Institute, and the City
and County Almshouse.
It seems easier to delay the sec
ond collection of promised clothing
urftil after Christmas, as at that
time there will probably be much
cast off clothing among the stu
dents. This department of the
work has been put under the charge
of Miss Edith Spencer (University
P. O.), who will be glad to know of
any cast off clothing which may
be called for early in January.
