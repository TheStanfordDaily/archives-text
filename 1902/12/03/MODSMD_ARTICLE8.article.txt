# STANFORD TO BE REPRESENTED
## Several Faculty Members Will Attend Scientific Conventions During Holidays. 
### 
Stanford will be well represented
in the meetings of scientists to be
held in Washington from December
29th to January 3d. Prof. Vernon
L. Kellogg, of the Zoology depart
ment,will make an early departure,
leaving the University December
Bth. A week later go Prof. Doug
lass Houghton Campbell, head of
the Botany department, and Prof.
Oliver Peebles Jenkins, head of the
Physiology and Histology depart
ment. Dr. Jordan, although the
date of his departure is not defi
nitely fixed, will start on his East
ern trip shortly before the close of
the semester.
The goal of the three professors
is the annual convention of the
Association for the Advancement of
Science to be held in the buildings
of the Columbian University at
Washington, D. C. It will be the
largest single gathering of scientific
men of all universities that has
been held in recent years. Special
ists representing every branch of
science will be in attendance at the
sessions. The coming meeting is
the first to be conducted under the
new system. The association
meets once a year, and by an
agreement of the principal colleges
and universities, the week in which
the first of January falls each year
is called convention week. It is to
be devoted to a conclave of about
twenty scientific societies of the
United States.
All the Stanford representatives
will read papers before the conven
tion, and Dr. Campbell,as secretary
of the botanical section of the asso
ciation, will deliver the opening ad
dress before that section. During
their trip Professors Kellogg, Jen
kins, and Campbell will represent
Stanford at the annual meeting of
the Association of American Uni
versities, which is to convene in
New York the last of December.
This organization is made up of
the following institutions: Cali
fornia, Columbia, Stanford, Yale,
Catholic University, Clark, Cor
nell, Chicago, Harvard, Johns
Hop kins, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, and Princeton. Papers
and reports are to be presented by
the representatives of Columbia,
Pennsylvania, Yale, and Harvard.
The proceedings will close with a
banquet at Sherry's. Dr. Jordan's
presence at these meetings is doubt
ful as his time is already taken up
by numerous other engagements.
Prof. C. A. Duniway, of the His
tory department, will leave the
University about Decembor 16th to
attend the annual meeting of the
American Historical Association in
New York the latter part of De
cember. The American Economic
Association assembles in New York
at the same time, but the Stanford
department of Economics will
probably be unrepresented.
On his way East Dr. Kellogg
will visit the Universities of Kan
sas and Chicago, and Cornell Uni
versity. During his absence after
December Bth his work in the de
partment will he carried on by
Mrs. R. G. Bell.
