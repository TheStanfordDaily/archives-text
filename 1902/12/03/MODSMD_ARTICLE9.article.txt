# FINALS EXTEMPORE.
## Debating League Rules That Tryout Shall Be Modeled on Carnot. 
### 
The executive committee of the
Intersociety Debating League met
this afternoon to decide on the
method of conducting the Carnot
finals. As the change in the na
ture of the Carnot has made the
speaking almost extemporaneous,
it was thought best to follow the
same methods in the finals that
will be pursued against Berkeley.
A faculty committee of three, to be
selected by President J. H. Page of
the League, will submit the ques
tion to the candidates one hour be
fore they debate. The questions
will all be taken from the relations
of the French government to the
railroads.
