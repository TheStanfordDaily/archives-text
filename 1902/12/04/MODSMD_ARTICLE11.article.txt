# ROWING AT PENNSYLVANIA.
## Crew Manager Writes of Methods and Offers to Aid Stanford. 
### 
When the question of adding
rowing to intercollegiate ath
letics at Stanford cam« up last
spring the Daily Palo Alto corre
sponded with the managers of
many of the rowing associations in
the Eastern colleges where that
sport is firmly established. Among
the answers received was the follow
ing from Sol Metzger, who was
manager of the Pennsylvania crew
last season:
"We are very glad to give you
what little aid we can in furthering
the interests of this college sport at
your university. Rowing is our
most costly branch of athletics
here, as it brings us practically no
return and is a drain on the re
ceipts from football and other
sports; whereas in other branches
of athletics we receive more than is
necessary for their maintenance.
The equipments are expensive and
fragile, shells costing $550, and
sweeps $8 each. Besides it is neces
sary for us to go over a mile for
practice. We maintain a boat
house and a steam launch,the latter
for coaching purposes.
"The water course should be as
long as you can get it, to the limit
of four miles, although here ours is
three miles and we do most of our
training for the four-mile race at
Poughkeepsie. The course shouldbe
smooth,as rough water fills a shell
very easily, and deep water is pref
erable for the reason that it is a
little faster.
"Our men go on the machines
about January 15th and are taught
the fundamentals of the stroke and
the handling of an oar. They are
also putin good condition by this
work, so that when we go on the
water during the latter part of
April, the men are more or less
weeded out. Hard training for our
races begins in May.
"We would be very glad to aid
you in purchasing shells and
sweeps if you desire to obtain any.
In fact, we sould like very much to
aid you in any way we can to get
rowing started on the Pacific Coast;
and let me add that we hope some
day to see you struggling with us
and others at our Poughkeepsie
regatta in July. 1 know that you
would be very welcome there and
I know I am expressing the senti
ment of not only Pennsylvania
but of Cornell, Columbia, Wiscon
sin, Georgetown, and Syracuse
when I tell you this.
"Wishing you the best of success
in your new venture I remain
Very sincerely yours,
Sol Metzger,
Manager U. of P. crews."
