The Alumni Association finds
itself somewhat hampered in get
ting out its new directory by the
failure of a large number of gradu
ates to return the blanks sent out
last spring by the secretary of the
association. The directory is a
convenience and a means whereby
the alumni keep in touch with each
other. To accomplish its purpose
it must be complete. The energy
of its promoters should meet with a
much readier response than has
been accorded it.
