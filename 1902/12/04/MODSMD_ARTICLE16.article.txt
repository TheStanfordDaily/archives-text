For three months the University
Band has been working for the Un
iversity. Now it very appropri
ately announces that it is going to
exert itself in its own behalf. Next
semester it plans to give a concert
whose proceeds will be de
voted to paying for new instru
ments, the lack of which has long
been a disheartening handicap.
The musicians' efforts and aim
meet with entire approval. And
approval in this connection must
mean ready pecuniary support,
not mere verbal approbation.
