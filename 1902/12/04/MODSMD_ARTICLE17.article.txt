—The old chapel will be used
for Instructor Bassett's classes in
elocution after the Christmas holi
days. The regular recital ion
rooms have proved too small for
the work.
—The instruction staffs of the
Roble and Encina gymnasiums met
at Dr. Snow'a house last night and
discussed the work of the depart
ment. The meetings of this nature
are to be held fortnightly.
—The new experimental Bab
cock and Wilcox boiler in the Me
chanical laboratory has been com
pleted and was under steam
yesterday. The brick setting for
the horizontal tubular boiler is in

procesß of construction and will be
completed in about a week.
—The Museum lias received from
the Library seventy volumes of rare
books, the gift of David Hewes, Mrs.
Stanford's brother-in-law. The
books were transferred to the Mu
seum so that they may be exhibited
to better advantage. The most val
uable set is Ferrario's work on An
cient and Modern Costumes, in
thirty volumes.
