# New Engineering Equipment.
## 
### 
The new machine-shop at pres
ent lacks but three latlies of hav
ing a complete equipment. Ten
men are now busy working on the
foundry, which will be placed in
charge of one man at the beginning
of next semester and run during
the whole year. All the castings
for engines and boilers built at the
University can then be made here,
and students who have ideas they
wish to put into practice can
build their patterns the first year,
make the castings and forgings
during the second, and in the third
year turn out the finished machine.
The blacksmith shop will be
modernized within a year by the
addition of needed machinery, and
additions will be made from year
to year.
At present 2 4-horse-power gas
engines and two speed-lathes are
being assembled in the machine
shop, while the large bed for the
Westinghouse engine in the new
laboratory is on the planer.
