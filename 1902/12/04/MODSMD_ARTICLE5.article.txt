### 
At the Executive Committee meet
ing last night, action was taken in
regard to the collection of sub
scriptions for the tennis fund.
Thirteen members were selected to
form a committee which shall
have in charge the actual work of
collection. Those who are author
ized to solicit are O. Du F. Kehr
lein, '05; C. B. Hopper, '05; H. M.
Lewis, '04; N. Collyer, '04; J. Mori,
'03; W. F. Dunn, '04; E. E. Miller,
'04; A. E. Cooley, '03; Miss Cecelia
Atherton,'o3; C. K. Studley,'o3; F.
O. Ellenwood, '03; H. J. Edwards,
'01.
The reports of the managers of
the University Band and the Daily
Palo Alto were turned over to the
auditing committee. Attention was
then called to the work of the com
mittee which has in charge the dedi
cation exercises of the new gymna
sium. The Executive Committee
assured its financial support in
preparation of an elaborate scroll
to be enclosed in the corner-stone.
Feeling the propriety of enclosing
in the scroll the names of those
men who have been prominently
identified with athletics during the
history of the University, the
committee decided that the scope
should be made very wide. The
scores of all intercollegiate contests
between the University of California
and Stanford will be coupled with
the names of the members of all
Stanford's varsity teams. In addi
tion such wearers of the varsity
symbol as are at present in college
will be given a place. A complete
program of the dedication exercises,
together with all the addresses de
livered upon that occasion, will find
a place upon the scroll. The Stan
ford gymnassum clubs will be en
rolled, and there will be the spec
ifications of a dumb- and bar-bell
exercise of the regulation stamp.
At the close a history of the Stan
ford gymnasium will be given. The
work will be copied upon a scroll
of parchment under the direction
of L. E. Harter, '01, and H. W.
Chappel, '00.
