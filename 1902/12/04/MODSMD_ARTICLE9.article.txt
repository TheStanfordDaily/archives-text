### 
Instructor George C. Cook of the
English department has finished a
new novel which the Macraillan
Company will bring out in March.
It is a book dealing with the Maxi
milian period in Mexico and most
of the material was gathered by
Mr. Cook on a visit to Mexico two
years ago.
The title of the new work is
''Roderick Taliaferro," sub-named
"A Story of Maximilian's Empire."
The setting of the story is in the
time from 1865 to 1867. The in
terest centers about the hero,
Taliaferro, one of the luckless con
federates who left the South after
the war to take service in the im
perial Mexican army. During the
course of his adventures he falls in
love with a pretty Mexican girl
and a complication arises whereby
he is banished from the City of
Mexico. In order to get back the
ingenious hero joins a party of
bull-fighters.
Current history is dealt with in
a manner interesting and fascinat
ing. The story is full of action and
incidents and is replete with fight
ing and adventure. The fate of
Roderick is linked with that of
Maximilian. Although the work
cannot be called a religious novel,
one of its chief elements lies in the
fact that Taliaferro in faith is a
free-thinker, while the girl with
whom he is in love is a devout
Catholic. One historical feature of
the tale is the betrayal of the city
of Quertero by Lopez.
