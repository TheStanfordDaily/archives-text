# TENNIS AND BOATING.
## Formation of Club Sanctioned.â€” Rowing Conditions to be Investigated. 
### 
Last night C. H. Baker, of last
year's intercollegiate tennis team,
appeared before the Athletic Com
mittee in regard to the formation
of a tennis club which, shall in
some respects correspond in its
make-up to the Gymnasium Clubs.
The committee gave Baker per
mission to call a meeting of men
interested in the game. The con
stitution which they adopt will be
presented to the Athletic Committee
for ratification at their next meet
ing.
In discussion of the advisability
of making rowing an intercollegiate
contest it was shown that nothing
ought to be done until after a
thorough investigation of the bay
front and water-courses within
reaching distance of the campus.
During the Christmas vacation
Professor A. \V. Smith, Dr. Frank
Angell, H. S. Lee, '03, F. A. Brown,
'03, and A. S. Henley, ; 03, will
prepare a detailed statement con
cerning the possibilities of erecting
a boat-house and the manner of
carrying on the sport.
The affidavits, briefs, and other
records presented to the arbitration
committee in the Smith contro
versy by Dr. Angell were turned
over by him to be deposited in the
archives of the committee.
The committee considered the
advisability of proposing for Cali
fornia's consideration several
amendments to the intercollegiate
athletic agreement which will erad
icate any possibility of a repetition
of the situation preceding the last
intercollegiate football match.
