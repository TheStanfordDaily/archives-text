In the history of tennis at Stan
ford a large number of factional
fights are recorded. Last year the
hatchet was buried, and our repre
sentatives faced California players
with a unanimity of spirit that
was as admirable as it was unique.
Although in nine straight sets Stan
ford was defeated, she had gained
much. This fall finds the tennis
men still together, and ready to
fight until the ball flies across the
net for the last time. It is this
spirit that has prompted the pros
pective formation of the tennis
club —a step in the right direction.
No attempt will be made to break
away from student body control.
Intercollegiate contestants will be

stitution. The" sole object of the
