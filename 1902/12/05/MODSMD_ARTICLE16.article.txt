It is late in the semester to com
plain of an offence which has en
dured throughout the term, but
the accumulation of examinations
during the final fortnight makes a
protest imperative. During the
last two months the Library has

degenerated from a place of study
to a reception room. Although the
dress suit has not yet become a pre
requisite of these evening calls, the
practice of unlimited and unre
stricted conversation will eventu
ally terminate in functions from
which the individual on study bent
will be expelled as an interloper.
The Library is not a place of recre
ation, nor can a continued attempt
to thwart its real purpose be longer
tolerated. The strident tones of an
excited colloquy may be interesting
enough to the "vis-a-vis," but from
the standpoint of the man on the
other side of the partition they are
indefensible. Dereliction from duty
on the part of those Library assist
ants who fail to exercise their un
doubted prerogative in preventing
disorder, is inexcusable. A deter
mination to unite in opposing what
is becoming a general custom must
result in its speedy death. Imme
diate and complete revival of the
primitive quiet and decorum of the
Library is the only measure con
sistent with justice to one's self and
one's fellow students.
