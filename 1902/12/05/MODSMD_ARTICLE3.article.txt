# Some Track Talk.

### 
The track men will commence
keeping regular training rules the
first of next semester. "Dad"
Moulton has demanded so far noth
ing more than regular work, the
wearing off of the rough edges.
The men have not been put
through hard trials and no at
tempts at records have been made.
With the (rack well covered with
cinders many of the difficulties of
last year will not have to be en
countered. Much more systematic
and harder training will he made
possible.
The trials on the oval this semes
ter are much more satisfactory
than last year. Abbott, the fresh
man high-jumper, cleared 5 feet,
74 inches in practice Monday.
Broad-jumpers and hurdlers have
been rather scarce. Kuhn will

probably be able to get out after
the holidays. Trainer Moulton
spends about seven hours a day
within the confines of the oval
fence giving instruction to whoever
appears. He anticipates a con
siderable increase in the size of his
squad when spring commences.
Captain McCaughern has made
arrangements for securing an extra
amount of spikes. Men who de
sire to do work will be supplied at
the Training-house.
