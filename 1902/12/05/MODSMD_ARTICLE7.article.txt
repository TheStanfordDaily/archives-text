# Palo Alto Dailies Suspended.
## 
### 
The management of the two Palo
Alto dailies, the Press and the
Times, this morning announced the
discontinuance of their daily issues,
and their intention of henceforth
supplying their readers with weekly
sheets. Tijo experiment of conduct
ing a daily newspaper sheet in Palo
Alto has been found wholly unsuc
cessful, hence the change. This
leaves the Daily Palo Alto the
only daily in this community.
