# CORNERSTONE OF GYMNASIUM.
## Block Will Be Laid Thursday.â€”Exercises Conducted by Students. 
### 
Thursday, December 11th, is the
date set for laying the cornerstone
of the new Gymnasium, provisional
on good weather. The program
will begin at 2:30 o'clock. On ac
count of the fact that the semester's
examinations are approaching, the
intention to make the entire day a
holiday has been changed, and
afternoon work alone will be sus
pended. The intention is to dedi
cate the new llag-pole on the same
day.
Although thecommittee in charge
has not perfected the arrangements
for the laying of the cornerstone, a
tentative outline augurs well for
the success of the occasion. Presi
dent Jordan will initiate the cere
mony with a brief address. Dr.
Angell, chairman of the faculty
athletic committee, will also speak.
There will be brief talks by Captain
Lee of the football team, Captain
Brown of the baseball team, and
Track Captain McCaughern. C. W.
Thomas, '03, will read a history of
the Stanford gymnasium from its
inception to its culmination in the
new structure. Student body Pres
ident Dittmar and the presidents of
both the men's and the women's
Gymnasium Clubs will actively
participate in the exercises. The
Band will play. A complete pro
gram will probably be in evidence
by tomorrow afternoon.
