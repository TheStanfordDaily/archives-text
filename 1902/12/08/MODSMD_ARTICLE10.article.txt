# SUNDAY MORNING SERVICES.
## The
						Chaplain of Memorial Church Preaches His First Sermon in New Capacity. 
### 
Rev. D. Charles Gardner preached
his first sermon in the chapel yes
terday morning in his official ca
pacity as chaplain of the Memorial
Church. In the main the sermon
was an earnest appeal to the
students for sincere Christian liv
ing. In part the speaker said:
"There is much to he deplored in
the moral, social, and political con
ditions in California. The result
of the moral laxity of the early
days remains in San Fran
cisco and thence has spread
throughout the State. The re
ligious people, by not taking a firm
stand for what they know to be
right, are responsible for these con
ditions; for if all the Christians of
the State would show the courage
of their convictions, immorality
would melt away before them like
snow in warm sunshine. It is the
duty of every graduate of the Uni
versity to become a leader in the
community in which he lives; the
future of the country lies in the
hands of her educated people.
"Character is a necessary requi
site for success and leadership, and
nothing builds character like
Christian living. Every student
should devote a portion of each day
to consideration of spiritual affairs;
he should not neglect prayer, for in
prayer man, while acknowledging
his weakness, realizes his immor
tality and comes into a closer com
munion with his God. Science is
not the only thing to be studied in
college, for man cannot find peace
in the study of a science nor even
in the knowledge of all the sciences.
Mere education does not give happi
ness nor contentment; this can be
found only in following the teach
ings of Christ. The student should
therefore not neglect the study of
his Bible, for only through it can
he obtain both peace as a man and
place as a citizen."
Mr. Gardner announced that the
dedication of the Church will oc
cur Sunday, January 25th. He
also declared his desire to meet the
students in personal conference
whenever possible.
