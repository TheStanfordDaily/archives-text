The receipt of a challenge to de
hate from the University of Utah
is an event whose kind must in
evitably increase as the University
grows older and Western institu
tions commence to extend the range
of their intercollegiate contests.
In time the manner of meeting
such overtures will become a
problem; even now a decision in
the Utah matter is not to be
reached hastily.
The field of athletic rivalry, nar
row as it is, is broad in comparison
with debating possibilities. Once
prepared for a football game, or a
track meet, the number of contests
a team may enter is limited only
by available dates. Each inter
collegiate debate, on the other
hand, is the culmination of its
own season of tedious preparation.
An addition to the list will necessi
tate either an increased burden of
work for a few men or the selection
of representatives entirely distinct
from those of the California and
Washington teams.
The Washington debate, too, is
still so much in the nature of an
experiment that the undertaking
of another contest would be a some
what hazardous venture. On the
whole, the League committee ap
pears to be wisely cautious in ques
tioning the advisability of a Utah
debate.
