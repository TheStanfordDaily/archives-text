# Manner of Simon's Death

### 
The murder of Mr. Perry 0.
Simons, '99, which has always been
shrouded in mystery since the
despatch of last spring stating that
he had met his death at the hands
of a native guide, has at last been
made clear. Last September Presi
dent Jordan communicated with
the United States authorities at
Valparaiso concerning the details
of Mr. Simon's death. The reply
of Mr. Mansfield, United States
consul at that place, is appended:
"Replying to your favor of Sep

tember 19th last, I have to inform
you that the details of the murder
of Mr. Perry 0. Simons are
as follows:
"In December last Mr. Simons,
who was engaged in collecting spec
imens for the British Museum, and
other museums, was staying at the
hotel in Puente del lnca, in the
Argentine Republic, and contrary
to the advice of persons living there,
he started on a trip to Chile, across
the Cordilleras via the Uspallata
pass. He was accompanied by a
Chilean named Ventura Paveza,
who, presumably incited by motives
of robbery, attacked and murdered
Mr. Simons on Christmas night at
a place named Paramillo de las
Cuevas, a wild and lonely spot in
the mountains near the Chilean
and Argentine border. The body
was found and buried near the
scene of the tragedy. Later the
murderer was arrested and is now
in prison at Mendoza, Argentina,
having been sentenced to an indef
inite term of imprisonment.
"The murder occurred in Argen
tine territory. I had met Mr. Si
mons, and crossed the Andes soon
after his murder. Many of the
passes leading over the Cordilleras
are infested with a bad lot of char
acters. Very respectfully,
R. E. Mansfield, Consul.
