# FOOTBALL EAST AND WEST.
## Stanford and Columbia Player Discusses Game as Played on Two Seaboards. 
### 
An article by W. M. Erb, ex-'Ol,
in yesterday's Chronicle on "East
ern vs. Pacific Coast Football" is
worthy of careful reading. The
writer has played on both Eastern
and Western teams —half at Stan
ford and quarter at Columbia.
According to him football on the
Pacific Coast has a place by itself,
there being more of sport for sport's
sake than can be found anywhere
in the East. The members of the
Big Four —Yale, Harvard, Prince
ton, and Pennsylvania — are the
football trust of the East. They
set the pace, and the next two divi
sions—Brown, Columbia, and Cor
nell in one, and Swarthmore, Rut
gers, and Dickinson on the other —
try to keep up.
Football at Stanford and Cali
fornia is governed by public senti
ment. The idea prevails through
out the State that the game is a
sport and should be conducted as
such.
With the exception of the Yale-
Harvard game there is nothing in
the East to compare with the an
nual game in San Francisco. The
cheering and singing at the Yale-
Harvard game is better organized,
but does not carry the spirit of the
Western rooting.
The Eastern teams have marked
superiority over the Western stand
ard. They have better team-work,
better generalship, and better indi
vidual play. The reasons for this
are obvious. Each college has its
own style of play, which is never
changed. The squad is composed
of men who know the game, many
having played for years in prepar
atory school teams. The difficulty
in breaking in a husky six-footer
who never saw a football, is one
that rarely confronts an Eastern
coach. The Coast teams have a
distinctive style, that of California
being modeled after the Princeton
idea, while Stanford has many
traits of Yale's games.
The East has better teams be
cause it has more football, more
and better coaches, a larger num
ber of drilled candidates, and a
stricter discipline.
The Stanford team of '97 would
have had little trouble with Penn
sylvania or Princeton, and a game
between that team and Yale or

Harvard would have been worth
seeing.
If Berkeley had had a good
quarter in 1900 it would have
equaled any team in the East ex
cept Yale or Harvard.
As for individual stars, the West
can present a proportionately
larger number than the East.
"Wolfe" Ransome, the California
player, is said at Yale to be one of
the best that ever Appeared on their
squad. "Chet" Murphy, Stanford
'00, was hailed as a wonder last
year at Harvard. Smith and Hall,
old Californians, could have made
any team in the East. Traeger of
Stanford and I'ringle of California
as tackles would make either Har
vard or Yale happy. The center
trio of the Stanford '97 Varsity—
Burnett, Fickert and Carle —could
have held their own anywhere.
