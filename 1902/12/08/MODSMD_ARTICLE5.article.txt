# Performed with Liquid Air.
## 
### 
Friday evening before an audi
ence of three hundred W. B. Patty
showed how liquid air is made, ex
plained a large number of uses to
which it may be put, and per
formed interesting experiments.
Mr. Patty looked forward to the
time when manufacture of the liq
uid will be so cheapened that it
may become of commercial value.
"By it," said he, "houses will be
heated in winter and kept cool in
summer. It will be used to run
engines, to store air for use in sub
marine boats, and as an explosive.
The commercial, domestic, and
medical worlds will be revolution
ized."
Seventy-five dollars was cleared
from the entertainment.
