This morning the Freshman foot
ball players received their sweaters.
Instead of bearing the large nu
merals " '06," which would show
that the wearers had taken part in
the intercollegiate contest, each of
the jerseys is emblazoned with a
"1906." A year from hence it will
be impossible in so far as emblems
will indicate to tell whether the
sweater was awarded for playing
football against California or for
winning a point in the class field
day. The changing of the numer
als probably was not sanctioned by
the Freshman class, the members
of the team, or the managers who
sent in theorder. Nevertheless the
mistake has been made and should
be rectified before the sweaters are
worn.
