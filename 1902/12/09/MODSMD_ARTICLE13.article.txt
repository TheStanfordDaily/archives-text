# No Trip for Wisconsin.
## 
### 
Clifford Roe, the advance agent
of the Wisconsin football team, has
been on the campus since yester
day morning. He had gained the
consent of the Indians of the Sher
man Institute for a vacation game
and was also considering the feasi
bility of bringing the Carlisle In
dians to the Coast for a Beries of
games with his team. This morn
ing he received a telegram from the
faculty of the University of Wis
consin informing him that since he
could obtain a match with neither
the University of California nor
Stanford the team would not make
the trip. Yesterday at a joint
meeting of the Wisconsin faculty
and the members of the football
squad this decision was reached.
This means that no big Eastern
team will this year appear upon a
California gridiron unless the Car
lisle Indians come out to play
their brothers from the southern
end of the State.
Roe himself is a Michigan man
and after failing to make arrange
ments for the Wisconsin contest
he endeavored to get Manager Ed
wards to consent to a game with
Michigan next year. Edwards was
unable to accede to such a propo
sition.
