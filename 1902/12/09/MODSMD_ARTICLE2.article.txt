1. Tender vistas ever new
Through the arches meet the eyes,
Where the red roofs rim the blue
i* ; Of the sun steeped skies
Flecked with cloudlets sailing.
Here we raise our voices hailing
Thee our Alma Mater.
—Cuoitus.

3. When the moonlight bathed arcade
Stands in evening calms,
When the light wind half afraid
Whispers in the palms,
Far off swelling, failing,
Student voices glad are hailing
Thee our Alma Mater.
- Chorus.
