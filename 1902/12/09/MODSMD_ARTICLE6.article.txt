Freshman Sweaters.
The sweaters for the
Freshman football
eleven were distrib
uted by Manager Ed
wards today. Four
teen men were the
recipients of the em
blem. Through an
unfortunate mistake
on the part of either
the man who ordered
the sweaters or the
man who made them,
they failed to comply
with the regulation
design. Instead of the
white symbol " '06,"
which is the distinct
ive mark of the Fresh
man football eleven,
the red sweaters were
marked with " 1906."
The fourteen men
who received sweaters
are: W. R. Schofield,
I. J. Bounds, H. J.
Litt, A. M. Porter,
W. K. Sprott, J. I.
Chenery, B. Bryan,
F. R. Estes, J. B.

Cheadle, F. Preston, L. W. Cutler,
W. P. Magee, G. E. Morrissey, A.
T. Shine.
