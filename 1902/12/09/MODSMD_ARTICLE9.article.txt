An explanation sometimes ad
vanced for the prevalent lack of
familiarity with "Hail, Stanford,
H ail" is the fact that the song does
not exist in a sufficiently popular
and accessible form. To remove
the last prop from such an excuse
the Daily Palo Alto reproduces
the words and music in full. To
morrow comes the University
Assembly—the last meeting before
we scatter for the holidays. Be
sides our own community there will
be present a distinguished visitor
from the University of California,
a famous clergyman who has
crossed a continent to aid in the
University's building, and Mrs.
Stanford, the announcement of
whose homecoming has been re
ceived with a thrill of pleasure.
What better occasion than this to
sing "Hail, Stanford, Hail" in a
manner to put an effectual quietus
on the assertion that Stanford does
not appreciate the possession of the
noblest of college songs.
