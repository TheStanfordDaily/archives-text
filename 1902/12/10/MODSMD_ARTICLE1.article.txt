# UNIVERSITY ASSEMBLY.
## Notable Addresses Characterized Semester's Last Gathering. 
### 
The third and last Assembly of
the year was held this morning at
the last hour. Its success was a
repetition of that of the former
meetings.
The first speaker was Dr. J. M.
Stillman, representing the Stanford
faculty. His speech was an ear
nest plea for a greater spirit of re
sponsibility among undergradu
ates. "It is a tendency shown in
our colleges," said he, "as well as
in American life generally, to wear
rather lightly those duties which
may be comprised in the word 'cit
izenship.' It cannot be denied that
we Americans too often show a
good-humored indifference to gen
eral injustice and misrule. We
have the 'representative' habit too
much. Each man does not feel it
his duty to take the trouble to see
that things are put right. A col
lege class will sometimes condone
things done by a few members,
which the great majority would
actually be ashamed to be caught
at. Be quiet and firm in the ex
pression of your convictions, but
have them, and learn to be a
leader."
Dr. Jordan next introduced Dr.
Clarence John Blake of Harvard
University. Professor Blake said
that he had come from his own in
stitution "not as one bringing a
message from the East, but as one
from the East to learn. You have
here an enormous opportunity, an
opportunity unhampered by tradi
tion, to form in this, comparatively
speaking, newly settled section of
our country an institution which
will impart not only to yourselves
but to coming generations the pow
er of living rightly and living well.
Its students are to remember that
they are to be teacherß and guides
of men. This influence will extend
not only all over our own country,
but through the world as well."
"As already a Stanford man,"
Dr. Jordan introduced Dr. Heber
Newton, the new pastor of Memorial
Church.
Dr. Newton reciprocated the spirit
of the greeting. "I do not feel like
a stranger," he said. "Your cordial
welcome last night, the chivalrous
and loyal spirit shown toward the
Founder of this University, and
your unexpected remembrance of
me even in the joy of getting her
back again among you, would be
enough alone to show what is the
Stanford spirit. But that name is
not unknown in the East. I re
member that it was potent during
the dark days of the Civil War to
keep California in the Union, and
later came the wonderful concep
tion of this University. In the last
years when left alone to finish the
work she and her husband had be
gun, Mrs. Stanford has gone about
it with statesmanlike wisdom,
womanly intuition, and a generous
munificence that shames the wealth
of the East.
"When I viewed for the first
time the new buildings here, and
especially the beauty and grandeur
of the Church, I felt that here was
the center of all this life and

promise. The Church stands forth
as a monument of devotion and
generosity."
Professor H. Morse Stephens of
the University of California was
the last speaker of the morning.
He too claimed not to be a stranger
to Stanford and the Stanford
spirit. It had been his privilege
through Cornell University and its
former president, Andrew D. White,
to receive something of what might
be termed the father to the more
permanent Stanford spirit. Apro
pos of his present connection with
the University of California, he
was reminded of his former feeling
as an undergraduate of Oxford
University. Professor Stephens
said: "We Oxford men had a feel
ing toward the students of Cam
bridge of regarding them—well, as
unfortunates. Before I go on with
the main subject on which I am to
speak to you this morning I want
to express the hope of an old Ox
ford man that we may soon have
boating between the two univer
sities. I am glad to learn that
steps are now being taken looking
toward that end.
"Not long ago one of your pro
fessors came up to Berkeley, and
we listened with much attention to
what he said to us of college spirit.
It is true that the two universities
are greatly in need of each other.
The relations of the two universi
ties should be those of friendly
rivalry and stimulus in the future.
"As an Englishman who expects
to live and die in America I may
be permitted to say one thing
which sometimes shocks an Eng
lishman in this country. It is the
lack of seeking for knowledge for
knowledge's sake. And above all
places in this University, which
has this noble cathedral, dedicated
to worship and beauty, it should
not be met with here. But our
universities should stand for love
of truth, and its patient seeking.
Something of that old mediajval
spirit, the thirst for knowledge, I
would have more of. VVe should
have room in the midst of our
utilitarian studies for some matters
of pure scholarship along lines
which may be of no importance in
material advancement but make
the love and service of truth itself."
