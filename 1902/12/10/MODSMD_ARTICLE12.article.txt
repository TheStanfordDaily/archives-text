Tomorrow comes the first tan
gible move toward the realization
of a hope cherished for years. The
long season of planning for the
Stanford Gymnasium has been
characterized by quiet effort and
the exercise of judgment on the
part of the Founder which has as
sured quarters for physical de
velopment of adequacy beyond all
expectation. The ceremonies of
the cornerstone laying mark the
evolution of an idea into a reality
that all will see and appreciate.
From Mrs.Stanford the Gymnasium
is a personal gift to the students.
The exercises are in the hands of
the student body and a half-holi
day has given an opportunity for
universal attendance.
