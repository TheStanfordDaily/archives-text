# MRS. STANFORD WELCOMED.
## Greeted by Enthusiastic Demonstration on Her Return from the East. 
### 
Never wns better evidence given
of the affectionate regard in which
the students hold Mrs. Stanford
than last night, when four hun
dred students braved the threaten
ing weather and marched to the
Stanford residence to welcome the
surviving Founder of the Univer
sity back to the campus after an
absence of two months in the East.
In the spontaneity of the gather
ing, in enthusiasm, and in the
warmth of the welcome extended to
Mrs. Stanford, it has been equaled
by no demonstration.
The assembling took place at
Encina at 7:30. Headed by the
Band, the long procession marched
in fours to the How, and back
through the quadrangle to the Li
brary, and then past the Museum
and through the arboretum to the
estate. All the men uncovered as
the march took them by the Mau
soleum.
The procession approached the
residence quietly and grouped
itself about the veranda to sing
"Hail, Stanford, Hail." Mrs. Stan
ford's appearance was the signal
for a mighty demonstration. When
the cheering had ceased, she ad
dressed the crowd briefly in a
voice full of emotion. "I am sure
you are all very welcome, boys,"
she said, "but yours is a great wel
come to come to. It is a great
coming back for me, and I appre
ciate it very much." She then in
troduced I)r. Newton.
The new pastor of Memorial
Church was cheered enthusiastic
ally. His manner appealed to the
crowd, and he was given round
after round of applause. He said:
"I thank you very much for your
welcome to me, boys. I told the
representative of your Daily Palo
Alto this afternoon that I left my
tongue in New York, but since i
arrived here I have been using my
eyes to good effect viewing your
beautiful buildings. 1 want to say
that the thing that has appealed
to me most is the chivalry of your
welcome to Mrs. Stanford."
Dr. Jordan was called on and
spoke only long enough to intro
duce Mr. C. G. Lathrop, whose re
marks were also brief.
At the request of Mrs. Stanford
"One, Two, Three, Four" was sung,

and then the visitors were invited
into the house, where a repast
awaited them. "Hail, Stanford,
Hail" was given, and every one
present drank a lemonade toast to
"►Stanford College." The Mando
lin Club played as Mrs. Stanford
greeted the students. She remarked ,
that the gathering reminded her of'
"old times," when the students used
to come over while Senator Stanford
was alive.
Mrs. Jordan and Mrs. Newton j
assisted in the receiving.
