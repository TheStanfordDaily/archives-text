# LAYING OF THE CORNERSTONE.
## Students Will Hold Exercises Tomorrow Afternoon at Site of New Gymnasium. 
### 
The cornerstone of the new Gym
nasium will be laid with appropri
ate exercises at 2:30 tomorrow
afternoon. The event epitomizes
the initiation of new activities
which the presence of Mrs. Stan
ford always insures. The exer
cises will be conducted by the stu
dent body. As Dr. Jordan ex
pressed it this morning, everything
will be "of the students, by the
students, for the students." All
University work will be suspended
during the afternoon, but the Li
brary reopens at four o'clock.
The University Band will be there
to accompany the singing; there
will be a section reserved for
the organized rooters, and pro
vision for all to see and hear.
The appended program is complete
in detail and provides for a gather
ing in which every interest will be
represented that touches the Gym
nasium directly or indirectly. The
scroll to be placed within the stone
will contain a full record of all
the speeches given, a register of the
wearers of the Varsity "S," the
memorial to be tendered Mrs. Stan
ford, with appended signatures of
the student body, copies of all col
lege publications and all San Fran
cisco papers of the day, and an ap
propriate private collection of Mrs.
Stanford's. Should inclement
weather prevent the holding of the
exercises, they will take place on
Friday afternoon at the same hour.
