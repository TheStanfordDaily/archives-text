The executive board of the Wo
man's Athletic Association yester
day added Misses Hattie Haub,
'03, and Elizabeth Lodge, '03, to
the wheeling and tennis com
mittees respectively.
The basket-ball, bicycling, and
pedestrian committees reported,and
plans for next semester were dis
cussed. In handball it developed
that nothing has been done, since
the gymnasium floor is too crowded
to permit practice. A new out
door court is projected.
