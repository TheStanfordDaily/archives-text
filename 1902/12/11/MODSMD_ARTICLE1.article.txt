# CORNERSTONE IN PLACE.
## First Block in Masonry of Gymnasium Laid with Appropriate Ceremony. 
### 
Accompanied by exercises whose
essence was the quiet dignity and
true feeling engendered by the deep
and heartfelt sincerity underlying
every address, the cornerstone of
the new Gymnasium was laid this
afternoon. At 2:30 the threaten
ing weather granted a temporary
respite and the speakers of the day
returned to the stand around
which thronged an audience of
undergraduates, alumni, visitors,
and faculty. Before Dr. Newton
had delivered his invocation the
true significance of the occasion was
reflected in the faces of the on
lookers. President Jordan acted
as master of ceremonies at the
gathering —almost entirely student
both in speakers and those ad
dressed.
Dr. Newton delivered the invoca
tion and was followed by Dr. Jor
dan, whose brief address was an

outline of the Uni
versity's work and
the added breadth
the new Gymnasium
would give to the
field. He spoke of
the founding of the
University and the
lines along which it
had been developed;
of the mental life
and the moral life
that had each been
amply provided for,
the one in the build
ings standing since
the early days,? the
other in Memorial
Church, from which
every spiritual influ
ence shall radiate in
the days to come'.

It is the physical life that has strug
gled along unaided, and it is for the
perfection of men, sound in body
as well as in mind and morals,
that this new building has risen.
This was the spirit of his remarks.
Dr. Frank Angell followed with
a powerful address, which in part
was as follows:
The Faculty and Athletics.
"When the members of the Stan
ford Faculty pitched their athletic
camp in that picturesque field yon
der, endeared to us by many a
pleasant association, it was but
with little expectation that in the
field across the way, parched by
the summer sun and flooded by
winter rains, there would arise the
stately structure promised by the
broad foundations lying before us.
"But while the presence of such
a stupendous hall of physical cul
ture so near us was something
which our imaginations had failed
to picture, there was going on in a
limited and unobtrusive way a
process which this building on this
site definitely symbolizes—a draw
ing together, a better mutual un
derstanding of students and facul
ty through mutual interest in
sports and games. In those quiet
little contests on the Faculty Field,
so keenly enjoyed by us all, we on
our side came to see that a man
who might not shine in the class
room was a manly and generous

opponent whom we were glad to
meet.
"The paramount question of to
day is, How is this great Gymna
sium going to affect athletics? How
will it affect athletics as distin
guished from gymnastics? Beside
the external requirements of ath
letes, the drying rooms, the bathing
facilities, we have still to ask the
further question, In how far is the
University through the Gymnas
ium to exercise an active and con
trolling power over athletics.
"The University may fairly see
to it that the contestants be physi
cally sound, that no one be per
mitted to subject himself to the
intense Rtrain of intercollegiate con
tests whom the University, through
the Gymnasium, pronounces unfit.
And in this respect it seems that it
is the duty of the Gymnasium offi
cials to err on the side of safety.
Again, we have been particularly
fortunate at this University in hav
ing as Gymnasium directors men
like Dr. Snow andDr. Storey, who
have not divorced the Gymnasium

from athletics, as is too frequently
the case, but have made the two
mutually helpful.
"I cannot feel that the ex
penditure of large sums of money
is either necessary or useful; on
the contrary, it seems to me that
it constitutes a distinct menace to
sport for sport's sake —that it de
files the very font of pure ama
teurism. It makes possible the
career of that baleful appearance
in our college athletics —the athlete
parasite who goes into sport for
what he can get out of it.
"Although Stanford has never
been unduly extravagant in the
past, I note that our athletic ex
penses have increased fifty per
cent in the last six years. I ask
you, young gentlemen, Have our
teams as a whole increased fifty
per cent in efficiency since 1896?
"But I have not yet answered
my chief question. Should the
University authorities either
through the Gymnasium or some
committee, even a committee of
one, exercise absolute control and
direction over all branches of
athletics? To this I answer un
hesitatingly, No. It does not seem
to me that the idea of athletic
dictatorship is suited to the gen
eral freedom of the Stanford atmos
phere.
"The University of California
and Stanford have had eleven

annual football contests,but in none
of these eleven games played under
such trying circumstances has there
ever been an approximation to the
brutality which has too often dis
graced the games of great Eastern
institutions. In many of the re
finements, nay in some of the de
cencies, of intercollegiate athletics
we may have been found wanting;
but weighed in the balance of the
actual conflict, we have not been
found wanting.
"My young friends, I congratu
late you on the splendid athletic
and gymnastic future lying before
you; I congratulate you on the
prospect of extending to our Berke
ley friends and rivals a comfortable
and cheerful hospitality. May our
growth in the courtesies and refine
ments of athletics be commensurate
with the growth in the opportuni
ties to be given by the splendid
structure that will arise on these
foundations"
A review of the growth of the
present Gymnasium and its work
was given by C. \V. Thomas, '03.

Roble's Congratulations.
Miss Helen K. North, '04, presi
dent of the Roble Gymnasium Club,
spoke for the women of the Univer
sity, to tender congratulations to
the men. She said:
"It rests with me only to add to
the gratitude expressed by the men,
that of the women of the Univer
sity. The women appreciate all
that the Gym will mean to the men.
We realize that that which has been
good will now be better, and we
feel that the earnest efforts of the
men, handicapped as they have
been by the lack of an adequate
gymnasium, deserve just such a
reward.
"The men have earned their
Gymnasium, and the women of the
University wish to extend their
heartiest congratulations."
Raising of Flag.
Following Miss North's address
came the raising of the flag on the
200-foot pole at the head of Uni
versity avenue. The colors were
greeted by "America."
Football and the Gymnasium.
Howard Lee, captain of the foot
ball team, spoke of the help the
new Gymnasium would lend to the
branch of athletics he represents.
He said:
"The Gymnasium's careful in
struction gives the student confi
dence in himself, ability to decide

quickly, and strong, rugged sinews.
Competition is the very essence
of all intercollegiate athletic con
tests, and without means to prepare
for these contests the representative
University teams would make a
meagre showing indeed."
Captain Brown for Baseball.
Captain Brown of the baseball
team alluded to the relations of
the Gymnasium and the national
pastime. "The department has
aided the sport in every possible
way," he said. He laid particular
stress on the cooperation of the
Gymnasium and athletic captains,
as evidenced by the system of sub
stituting outdoor for indoor ex
ercise.
"With the facilities the new
Gymnasium will offer," he con
tinued, "we can expect to do better
work in the future. Under the
present conditions a Varsity team
only can be correctly handled dur
ing a season. The scrub player
does not receive proper attention,
and as a result we suffer for the

want of experienced
men from year to
year. \Ve expect the
Gymnasium at least
partially to remedy
this defect. The pol
icy of the Gymnas
ium has been excel
lent in the past, and
with cooperation in
the future we may
expect constant pro
gress in the character
of the game played
on the Stanford dia
mond."
Address of Track
Captain.
J. C. McCaughern,
'03, track captain,
spoke in behalf of
his branch of athlet

ics. He said, in regard to train
ing:
"To my mind there is more need
here of a reform movement in the
student body than among the ath
letes themselves. We must have a
sentiment that will not tolerate in
our midst an athlete who by in
fringement of necessary rules and
regulations becomes a traitor both
to his team and to his University."
Gymnastic Work and Tennis.
Cleveland Baker, '04, spoke in
behalf of the tennis interests, indi
cating in a forcible manner the
interrelation between gymnastic
exercise and proficiency on the
courts. In part he said:
"The different gymnasium ap
paratus which are particularly of
assistance are the machines for the
wrist and those for the develop
ment of the grasp and forearm.
The rowing machines and overhead
parallels are important in that
they develop the muscles of the
arms and back.
"Handball and apparatus work
call forth great activity, both physi
cal and mental. Like tennis they
elicit physical response to mental
suggestion. It is absolutely essen
tial that a person have the control
of his muscles. The test which
most often is applied to tennis is
that of having "staying power"—
being able to put up a strong game

A review of the growth of the
present Gymnasium and its work
was given by C. \V. Thomas, '03.

Roble's Congratulations.
Miss Helen K. North, '04, presi
dent of the Roble Gymnasium Club,
spoke for the women of the Univer
sity, to tender congratulations to
the men. She said:
"It rests with me only to add to
the gratitude expressed by the men,
that of the women of the Univer
sity. The women appreciate all
that the Gym will mean to the men.
We realize that that which has been
good will now be better, and we
feel that the earnest efforts of the
men, handicapped as they have
been by the lack of an adequate
gymnasium, deserve just such a
reward.
"The men have earned their
Gymnasium, and the women of the
University wish to extend their
heartiest congratulations."
Raising of Flag.
Following Miss North's address
came the raising of the flag on the
200-foot pole at the head of Uni
versity avenue. The colors were
greeted by "America."
Football and the Gymnasium.
Howard Lee, captain of the foot
ball team, spoke of the help the
new Gymnasium would lend to the
branch of athletics he represents.
He said:
"The Gymnasium's careful in
struction gives the student confi
dence in himself, ability to decide

quickly, and strong, rugged sinews.
Competition is the very essence
of all intercollegiate athletic con
tests, and without means to prepare
for these contests the representative
University teams would make a
meagre showing indeed."
Captain Brown for Baseball.
Captain Brown of the baseball
team alluded to the relations of
the Gymnasium and the national
pastime. "The department has
aided the sport in every possible
way," he said. He laid particular
stress on the cooperation of the
Gymnasium and athletic captains,
as evidenced by the system of sub
stituting outdoor for indoor ex
ercise.
"With the facilities the new
Gymnasium will offer," he con
tinued, "we can expect to do better
work in the future. Under the
present conditions a Varsity team
only can be correctly handled dur
ing a season. The scrub player
does not receive proper attention,
and as a result we suffer for the

want of experienced
men from year to
year. \Ve expect the
Gymnasium at least
partially to remedy
this defect. The pol
icy of the Gymnas
ium has been excel
lent in the past, and
with cooperation in
the future we may
expect constant pro
gress in the character
of the game played
on the Stanford dia
mond."
Address of Track
Captain.
J. C. McCaughern,
'03, track captain,
spoke in behalf of
his branch of athlet

ics. He said, in regard to train
ing:
"To my mind there is more need
here of a reform movement in the
student body than among the ath
letes themselves. We must have a
sentiment that will not tolerate in
our midst an athlete who by in
fringement of necessary rules and
regulations becomes a traitor both
to his team and to his University."
Gymnastic Work and Tennis.
Cleveland Baker, '04, spoke in
behalf of the tennis interests, indi
cating in a forcible manner the
interrelation between gymnastic
exercise and proficiency on the
courts. In part he said:
"The different gymnasium ap
paratus which are particularly of
assistance are the machines for the
wrist and those for the develop
ment of the grasp and forearm.
The rowing machines and overhead
parallels are important in that
they develop the muscles of the
arms and back.
"Handball and apparatus work
call forth great activity, both physi
cal and mental. Like tennis they
elicit physical response to mental
suggestion. It is absolutely essen
tial that a person have the control
of his muscles. The test which
most often is applied to tennis is
that of having "staying power"—
being able to put up a strong game
[Continued on fourth page.]

Accompanied by exercises whose
essence was the quiet dignity and
true feeling engendered by the deep
and heartfelt sincerity underlying
every address, the cornerstone of
the new Gymnasium was laid this
afternoon. At 2:30 the threaten
ing weather granted a temporary
respite and the speakers of the day
returned to the stand around
which thronged an audience of
undergraduates, alumni, visitors,
and faculty. Before Dr. Newton
had delivered his invocation the
true significance of the occasion was
reflected in the faces of the on
lookers. President Jordan acted
as master of ceremonies at the
gathering —almost entirely student
both in speakers and those ad
dressed.
Dr. Newton delivered the invoca
tion and was followed by Dr. Jor
dan, whose brief address was an

outline of the Uni
versity's work and
the added breadth
the new Gymnasium
would give to the
field. He spoke of
the founding of the
University and the
lines along which it
had been developed;
of the mental life
and the moral life
that had each been
amply provided for,
the one in the build
ings standing since
the early days,? the
other in Memorial
Church, from which
every spiritual influ
ence shall radiate in
the days to come'.

It is the physical life that has strug
gled along unaided, and it is for the
perfection of men, sound in body
as well as in mind and morals,
that this new building has risen.
This was the spirit of his remarks.
Dr. Frank Angell followed with
a powerful address, which in part
was as follows:
The Faculty and Athletics.
"When the members of the Stan
ford Faculty pitched their athletic
camp in that picturesque field yon
der, endeared to us by many a
pleasant association, it was but
with little expectation that in the
field across the way, parched by
the summer sun and flooded by
winter rains, there would arise the
stately structure promised by the
broad foundations lying before us.
"But while the presence of such
a stupendous hall of physical cul
ture so near us was something
which our imaginations had failed
to picture, there was going on in a
limited and unobtrusive way a
process which this building on this
site definitely symbolizes—a draw
ing together, a better mutual un
derstanding of students and facul
ty through mutual interest in
sports and games. In those quiet
little contests on the Faculty Field,
so keenly enjoyed by us all, we on
our side came to see that a man
who might not shine in the class
room was a manly and generous

opponent whom we were glad to
meet.
"The paramount question of to

prospect of extending to our Berke
ley friends and rivals a comfortable
and cheerful hospitality. May our
growth in the courtesies and refine
ments of athletics be commensurate
with the growth in the opportuni
ties to be given by the splendid
structure that will arise on these
foundations"
A review of the growth of the
present Gymnasium and its work
was given by C. \V. Thomas, '03.

Roble's Congratulations.
Miss Helen K. North, '04, presi
dent of the Roble Gymnasium Club,
spoke for the women of the Univer
sity, to tender congratulations to
the men. She said:
"It rests with me only to add to
the gratitude expressed by the men,
that of the women of the Univer
sity. The women appreciate all
that the Gym will mean to the men.
We realize that that which has been
good will now be better, and we
feel that the earnest efforts of the
men, handicapped as they have
been by the lack of an adequate
gymnasium, deserve just such a
reward.
"The men have earned their
Gymnasium, and the women of the
University wish to extend their
heartiest congratulations."
Raising of Flag.
Following Miss North's address
came the raising of the flag on the
200-foot pole at the head of Uni
versity avenue. The colors were
greeted by "America."
Football and the Gymnasium.
Howard Lee, captain of the foot
ball team, spoke of the help the
new Gymnasium would lend to the
branch of athletics he represents.
He said:
"The Gymnasium's careful in
struction gives the student confi
dence in himself, ability to decide

quickly, and strong, rugged sinews.
Competition is the very essence
of all intercollegiate athletic con
tests, and without means to prepare
for these contests the representative
University teams would make a
meagre showing indeed."
Captain Brown for Baseball.
Captain Brown of the baseball
team alluded to the relations of
the Gymnasium and the national
pastime. "The department has
aided the sport in every possible
way," he said. He laid particular
stress on the cooperation of the
Gymnasium and athletic captains,
as evidenced by the system of sub
stituting outdoor for indoor ex
ercise.
"With the facilities the new
Gymnasium will offer," he con
tinued, "we can expect to do better
work in the future. Under the
present conditions a Varsity team
only can be correctly handled dur
ing a season. The scrub player
does not receive proper attention,
and as a result we suffer for the

want of experienced
men from year to
year. \Ve expect the
Gymnasium at least
partially to remedy
this defect. The pol
icy of the Gymnas
ium has been excel
lent in the past, and
with cooperation in
the future we may
expect constant pro
gress in the character
of the game played
on the Stanford dia
mond."
Address of Track
Captain.
J. C. McCaughern,
'03, track captain,
spoke in behalf of
his branch of athlet

ics. He said, in regard to train
ing:
"To my mind there is more need
here of a reform movement in the
student body than among the ath
letes themselves. We must have a
sentiment that will not tolerate in
our midst an athlete who by in
fringement of necessary rules and
regulations becomes a traitor both
to his team and to his University."
Gymnastic Work and Tennis.
Cleveland Baker, '04, spoke in
behalf of the tennis interests, indi
cating in a forcible manner the
interrelation between gymnastic
exercise and proficiency on the
courts. In part he said:
"The different gymnasium ap
paratus which are particularly of
assistance are the machines for the
wrist and those for the develop
ment of the grasp and forearm.
The rowing machines and overhead
parallels are important in that
they develop the muscles of the
arms and back.
"Handball and apparatus work
call forth great activity, both physi
cal and mental. Like tennis they
elicit physical response to mental
suggestion. It is absolutely essen
tial that a person have the control
of his muscles. The test which
most often is applied to tennis is
that of having "staying power"—
being able to put up a strong game

Accompanied by exercises whose
essence was the quiet dignity and
true feeling engendered by the deep
and heartfelt sincerity underlying
every address, the cornerstone of
the new Gymnasium was laid this
afternoon. At 2:30 the threaten
ing weather granted a temporary
respite and the speakers of the day
returned to the stand around
which thronged an audience of
undergraduates, alumni, visitors,
and faculty. Before Dr. Newton
had delivered his invocation the
true significance of the occasion was
reflected in the faces of the on
lookers. President Jordan acted
as master of ceremonies at the
gathering —almost entirely student
both in speakers and those ad
dressed.
Dr. Newton delivered the invoca
tion and was followed by Dr. Jor
dan, whose brief address was an

outline of the Uni
versity's work and
the added breadth
the new Gymnasium
would give to the
field. He spoke of
the founding of the
University and the
lines along which it
had been developed;
of the mental life
and the moral life
that had each been
amply provided for,
the one in the build
ings standing since
the early days,? the
other in Memorial
Church, from which
every spiritual influ
ence shall radiate in
the days to come'.

It is the physical life that has strug
gled along unaided, and it is for the
perfection of men, sound in body
as well as in mind and morals,
that this new building has risen.
This was the spirit of his remarks.
Dr. Frank Angell followed with
a powerful address, which in part
was as follows:
The Faculty and Athletics.
"When the members of the Stan
ford Faculty pitched their athletic
camp in that picturesque field yon
der, endeared to us by many a
pleasant association, it was but
with little expectation that in the
field across the way, parched by
the summer sun and flooded by
winter rains, there would arise the
stately structure promised by the
broad foundations lying before us.
"But while the presence of such
a stupendous hall of physical cul
ture so near us was something
which our imaginations had failed
to picture, there was going on in a
limited and unobtrusive way a
process which this building on this
site definitely symbolizes—a draw
ing together, a better mutual un
derstanding of students and facul
ty through mutual interest in
sports and games. In those quiet
little contests on the Faculty Field,
so keenly enjoyed by us all, we on
our side came to see that a man
who might not shine in the class
room was a manly and generous

opponent whom we were glad to
meet.
"The paramount question of to
day is, How is this great Gymna
sium going to affect athletics? How
will it affect athletics as distin
guished from gymnastics? Beside
the external requirements of ath
letes, the drying rooms, the bathing
facilities, we have still to ask the
further question, In how far is the
University through the Gymnas
ium to exercise an active and con
trolling power over athletics.
"The University may fairly see
to it that the contestants be physi
cally sound, that no one be per
mitted to subject himself to the
intense Rtrain of intercollegiate con
tests whom the University, through
the Gymnasium, pronounces unfit.
And in this respect it seems that it
is the duty of the Gymnasium offi
cials to err on the side of safety.
Again, we have been particularly
fortunate at this University in hav
ing as Gymnasium directors men
like Dr. Snow andDr. Storey, who
have not divorced the Gymnasium

from athletics, as is too frequently
the case, but have made the two
mutually helpful.
"I cannot feel that the ex
penditure of large sums of money
is either necessary or useful; on
the contrary, it seems to me that
it constitutes a distinct menace to
sport for sport's sake —that it de
files the very font of pure ama
teurism. It makes possible the
career of that baleful appearance
in our college athletics —the athlete
parasite who goes into sport for
what he can get out of it.
"Although Stanford has never
been unduly extravagant in the
past, I note that our athletic ex
penses have increased fifty per
cent in the last six years. I ask
you, young gentlemen, Have our
teams as a whole increased fifty
per cent in efficiency since 1896?
"But I have not yet answered
my chief question. Should the
University authorities either
through the Gymnasium or some
committee, even a committee of
one, exercise absolute control and
direction over all branches of
athletics? To this I answer un
hesitatingly, No. It does not seem
to me that the idea of athletic
dictatorship is suited to the gen
eral freedom of the Stanford atmos
phere.
"The University of California
and Stanford have had eleven

annual football contests,but in none
of these eleven games played under
such trying circumstances has there
ever been an approximation to the
brutality which has too often dis
graced the games of great Eastern
institutions. In many of the re
finements, nay in some of the de
cencies, of intercollegiate athletics
we may have been found wanting;
but weighed in the balance of the
actual conflict, we have not been
found wanting.
"My young friends, I congratu
late you on the splendid athletic
and gymnastic future lying before
you; I congratulate you on the
prospect of extending to our Berke
ley friends and rivals a comfortable
and cheerful hospitality. May our
growth in the courtesies and refine
ments of athletics be commensurate
with the growth in the opportuni
ties to be given by the splendid
structure that will arise on these
foundations"
