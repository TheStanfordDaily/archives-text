# BANSBACH ELECTED.
## Quarter-back the Winner of a Three-Cornered Fight for Captaincy by Two Ballots. 
### 
Louis P. Bansbach, '04, was
elected leader of the football team
of 1903, at the annual election held
in Encina Hall last night. The
light for the captaincy was three
cornered, the other candidates being
11. J. McFadden, '04, and George
Clark, '04. On the first ballot Mc-
Fadden received six votes, Bans
bach five, and Clark three. There
were only fourteen men entitled to
participate in the election by a rule
adopted two years ago,which accord
ed that privilege only to those men
who played in the Intercollegiate
game. There was another ballot,
in which Bansbach gained one, and
then on the third ballot Clark
withdrew. Bansbach's vote was
increased by two, making the final
cast McFadden six, Bansbach eight.
The winning candidate combines
in many respects the qualities
which are necessary for a successful
captain â€”a football head, natural
generalship, and excellence in play
ing his own position.
Bansbach registered in Law from
Denver, Colo., with the Class of
1904. His football experience be
fore coming to Stanford was con
fined to two years with the East
Denver high school, where he
played quarter-back. He was cap
tain and quarter of his Freshman
team, which defeated California
5-0, and made his Varsity sweater
the same year as substitute quarter.
Last year he played the season
through as sub-quarter, and in the
season just closed had no difficulty
in winning his place at the quarter
back's position.
Bansbach possesses powers
which have made his services
invaluable. He leads the team
well and holds the men together in
victory or defeat. Bansbach was a
member of last year's Athletic
Committee, and is a member of the
Sigma Nu fraternity.
