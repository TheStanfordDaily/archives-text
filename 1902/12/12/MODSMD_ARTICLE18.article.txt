Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In view of the haste that charac
terized the immediate preparation
for the cornerstone laying of yester
day, it is but just to make some
recognition of (he services of those
who lent a hand in the arrange
ments. The students are certainly
deeply indebted for the assistance
of the University authorities and
also for the part played by Mr.
McGilvray, who in spite of short
notice, overlooked not a single de
tail, and who, with Mr. Brown,
erected the platform at not a cent
of cost to the students. The many
students who gave their services in
one way and another are not to be
forgotten, and I particularly de
sire to express my appreciation of
the excellent work done by the
special student body committee
consisting of H. W. Chappel and
L. E. Harter. C. F. Dittmar,
Student body President.
