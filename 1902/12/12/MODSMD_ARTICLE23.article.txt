Mrs. Florence E. Dorsey, '99,
addressed a house meeting at lioble
last evening on the club-house pro
ject that is receiving the considera
tion of the California branch of the
National Association of Collegiate
Alumnae. It was explained that
at recent meetings of the organiza
tion there has been discussed the
advisability of admitting under
graduates to the privileges of the
new club-house to be opened in San
Francisco in September. A favor
able decision would mean that the
women of Stanford visiting in the
city, whether for a long or short
period, would find in the club
house a congenial home. But the
question is still pending.
Meanwhile the association has
established a tea-room in the
Adams building, on the corner of
Kearney and Sutter, where, for a
nominal sum, tea is served to the
members who drop in to rest dur
ing shopping trips. A dressing
room adjoining is available. It
was suggested that undergraduates
be allowed the privileges of the tea
room. A majority of the associa
tion favored the plan, but it was
determined to let the matter rest
until the undergraduates them
selves manifested some interest in
the matter.
Petitions for the use of the tea
room were drawn up immediately
after Mrs. Dorsey concluded. To
morrow morning they will be in
the Registrar's office to be signed
by Seniors and Juniors interested.
It is requested that the name of
every woman member of the two
upper classes appear on the papers,
especially since it is thoroughly
understood that on the amount of
enthusiasm shown in the matter
depends the possible granting of
admission to the club-house.
