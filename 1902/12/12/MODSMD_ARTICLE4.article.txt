The history of the Stanford
Gymnasium, read by Student As
sistant C. \V. Thomas, '03, at yes
terday's cornerstone laying, was
crowded out of the paper in the
make-up of last night. In out
line it was as follows:
"Encina Gymnasium was built
in the summer of 1891, and was
rushed to a state of occupancy in
order to accommodate the students
at the opening of the University in
October of that year. The build
ing was never finished, owing to
the fact that it was looked upon as
temporary, and that the funds of
the University were tied up during
the first years of its existence.
Except for a few minor changes, the
building has remained the same as
when it was first occupied.
"However, the equipment was
excellent. The apparatus was ex
tensive and of the best quality, and
the anthropometric machines were
the best to be had at the time.
"The Gymnasium opened in
1891 with Dr. T. D. Wood at the
head of the department and W. O.
Black as assistant. In 1891 two
hundred and two students regis
tered for work. The gymnastic
work was modeled on that of the
Y. M. C. A., but had little system,
the attention of the instructor being
given solely to the drills.
"Commencing with the first se
mester of 1893, C. W. Hetherington
took Black's place as assistant.
Hetherington had been trained in
the German Turn Verein, and he
emphasized apparatus work. Dur
ing the second semester of 1893-94
he persuaded the more enthusiastic
gymnasts to putin three hours a
week extra, in order to fit them
selves for leaders' work. Practic
ally this system prevails today.
"In 1896 T. A. Storey, '96, took
Hetherington's place as assistant.
It is largely due to him that the
Gymnasium is what it is. Harold
Hill, '98, was made the first stu
dent assistant.
"In 1899 handball was put in.
The popularity of the sport soon
called for two additional courts.
Wrestling, fencing, and boxing are
also taught.
"Beginning in January, 1900,
the spot system for drill work was
begun. The work is graded, the
best gymnasts going in the first
sections.
"The substitution of football,
baseball, track, and tennis for reg
ular indoor work—a system not
used in other gymnasia—begun in
1893, is still being used. The an
thropometric work now receives a
great deal of attention from the de
partment, and though equipped
with inadequate laboratories is
making great progress.
"In the fall semester of 1900 Dr.
W. F. Snow took Dr. W r ood's place
as head of the department. In
1901-02 Dr. 11. L. Wilbur filled the
position, Dr. Snow having gone
East to study. In the summer of
1902 Professor Storey went to the
Harvard Medical School, H. W.
Chappel, '00, taking his position,
and Dr. Snow returned.

"Considering the many incon
veniences, the crowded building,
the lack of heating and bathing
facilities, the progress of the Gym
nasium has been remarkable."
