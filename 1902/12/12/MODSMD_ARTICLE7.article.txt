# Mosaics on the Way.
## 
### 
Word has been received that the
two additional mosaics to go over
the side entrances in the interior of
Memorial Church were shipped
from Italy some time ago and are
now in transit. It is expected that
they will arrive here in a very few
days. In case they do the Italians
will commence work immediately
and it may be possible to have
them in place in time for the dedi
cation. The subjects of the two
mosaics are "Paradise," and"The
prophesy of the old prophets of the
coming of Christ."
