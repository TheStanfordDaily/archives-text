# CHRISTMAS SERMON.
## Significance of the Season the Topic of Chaplain Gardner's Address. 
### 
Rev. D.Charles Gardner preached
in the chapel yesterday morning a
Christmas sermon, President Jor
dan reading the scripture lessons
and Dr. Heber Newton leading in
prayer.
Mr. Gardner spoke of the signifi
cance of the Christmas season, of
what it stands for, how it is abused,
and what it is coming to mean.
He spoke in part as follows:
At Christmas the world seems to
forget its rivalries, and Peace be
comes the watchword of the na
tions. The Peace Conference, al
though in a measure a failure,
promises the world an era of better
feeling. I do not claim to be a
prophet, neither do I dream dreams,
yet do I believe the time is coming
when the sword shall be a plow
share, and Christ be hailed as the
Prince of Peace.
Christmas is an expression of
love for children, and they who
love not children can have no
share in its spirit.
One thing that 1 greatly regret
is the secularization of Christmas,
especially here in California. 1
mention this to you because each
in his own sphere may correct it.
We should preserve the sacred
spiritual meaning of Christmas.
But although Christmas is said
to have become a mere custom, be
neath the form is a deep power and
passion for good. Before the time
of Christ the sick and poor were
given but short shrift. Altruism
never prevailed so much as at pres
ent, and never before did the love
of God shine more brightly in the
hearts of men. But remember
this: so long as there is evil in the
world there will be work to do in
Christ's sweet name. Go home
with peace in your hearts, cherish
your loved ones, and transfer into
terms of life the spirit of Christ
mas, and let this day be one of
blessed worship as Christ would
have it.
