# Associations Song Service.
## 
### 
Last night in the special song serv
ice of the Christian Associations
the Girls' Glee Club appeared for
the first time this semester before a
University audience.
The carols reflected the spirit of
Christmas and were given with life
and animation. The solos were
sung creditably. The whole serv
ice was a fitting close to the Asso
ciations' meetings which have been
held in the chapel for ten vears
past.
With the dedication of Memorial
Church and the beginning of
morning and afternoon services,
which will be conducled by the
pastor and chaplain, the place of
the Associations' Sunday services
will be filled. Hereafter the Asso
ciations will carry on no regular
services other than the mid-week
meetings.
