Since the subscription list for
the tennis court fund started, the
Daily Palo Alto has not laid edi
torial stress on the need of imme
diate and universal contribution.
The appeal seemed so obviously
one meriting ready and generous
response that further exploitation
than a clear statement of the aim
of the subscription seemed unnec
essary. But conversation with
the different solicitors reveals the
curious fact that they are actually
experiencing some difficulty in se
curing the required amount. Many
students, they say, are responding
generously, some of them with a
much larger sum than a per
capita assessment would require.
Others are evasive, and apparently
suspicious of a bunko scheme.
It seems impossible, after the pub
licity that has been given the project
through the Assembly, the Sopho
more Minstrels, and the columns
of this paper, that there can be
anyone acute enough to remain in
college who is ignorant of the mean
ing of the Tennis Subscription
Fund; who does not realize that
Stanford's success in an intercol
legiate event is directly concerned;
and that his help, be it in ever
so small a degree, is needed at once.
Yet on no other grounds can indif
ference be explained.
The student body treasurer has
an opportunity to economize ma
terially if he can arrange to have
the work done within the next
week. But the contract must re
main unsigned until an adequate
amount is pledged. That the sum
will eventually be contributed there
can be no doubt. It is immediate
and general recognition of a duty
which should be a privilege,that we
would urge.

Engineer Hughes made the
rounds of the steam-heating system
today, and promises more and
steadier heat for the future. He
asks as a favor that the students in
the halls cooperate with him
as far as they can by turning off
the radiator supply when not
needed, thus economizing the heat
reserve and making it more effect
ive when needed. Steam will be
turned on hereafter at six in the
morning and continue until nine
in the evening. Unless some un
foreseen accident occurs, there will
be no repetition of the unfortunate
experience of today.
