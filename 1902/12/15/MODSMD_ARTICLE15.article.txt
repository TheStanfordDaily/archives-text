# Stanford in December "Sunset."

### 
"Stanford University: The Real
and the Ideal," by Cecil M. Mar
rack, '01, is the title of a well
illustrated and well-written article
in the December Sunset. It con
tains a series of half-tones of the
frieze on the Arch and nine half
tones of Memorial Church, six of
them being of windows. There are
half-tones of Dr. Jordan, the South
ern Pacific's double track and the
Palo Alto tree, the Museum, and
the Quadrangle. In speaking of
the article the Chronicle says:
"Cecil Marrack has the best sum
ming up that we have ever seen of
what the University has done and
what its work is to be."
Following Marrack's article are
the words of "Stanford Red," with
several verses added to those lately
printed in the Chaparral.
