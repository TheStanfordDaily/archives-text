# Track Notes.
## 
### 
The track men have ,been doing
very good work since the Thanks
giving vacation. Those who have
not within the last week run trials
for Trainer Moulton will do so be
fore Friday. The work for the
semester has been satisfactory both
to captain and trainer. The best
performance in the trials so far run
has been by C. L. Firebaugh, who
three weeks ago commenced work
ing on the half-mile. The track
has been in good condition, owing
to lack of wet weather.
The team will have to develop
some speedy hurdlers if it expects
to win the event from California,
although Stanford's chances have
materially increased since the an
nouncement that Cheek will not be
at California during the spring.
Li. L. Brooke, ex-'O3, the weight
man of the 1900 awl 1901 Varsities,
is expected back in January, as is
also Sprague, ex-'O4, the distance
man.
