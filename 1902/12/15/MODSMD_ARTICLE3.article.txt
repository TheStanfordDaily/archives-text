# Berkeley Loses Cheek.
## 
### 
Herbert C. Cheek, the hurdler
and jumper of the California track
team, has decided to leave college
and return to his home in Siam.
Without him the chances of the
Blue and Gold for a victory next
semester are exceedingly slim.
Cheek was rated as the second best
hurdler in the country, and was
sure of a place in the high jump.
Practically all the stars of last
year's team have been lost. Besides
Cheek they are Powell, hurdler and
juniper; Hussey, the broad jumper;
Plaw, the weight man; Bervice, the
half-miler; Iledewell, the mile run
ner ; and Topham, the broad
jumper.
