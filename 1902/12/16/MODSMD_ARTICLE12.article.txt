The last issue of the Daily Palo
Alto under the present regime will
appear Friday evening. In con
tinuing publication through the
final week the paper is somewhat
handicapped by having the exac
tions of examination time affect the
news-gathering efforts of its staff.
At this season there are always
many announcements to be made
relative to curriculum changes to
go into effect when work is resumed.
Some of these we have been able to
secure; for others we shall have to
depend on the cooperation of the
faculty. If instructors wishing
announcements printed will send
them to the office the editorial
problem will be much easier of solu
tion.
