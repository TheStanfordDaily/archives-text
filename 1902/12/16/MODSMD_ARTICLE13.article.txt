ThERE has been much discussion
of late in regard to the proposals
made by several Eastern educators
to shorten the college course lead
ing to the degree of A. B. The
Philadelphia Press ably treats of
some of the arguments for the pres
ent system in the following article:
A reduction of the college course
from four to three years by per
mitting a student by extra work
and superior ability to do the work
of the full course in a shorter time
has much to be said in its favor.
But to stop at the end of the sopho
more year deprives college of its
real office. The very name at
tached to the year measures the
half-baked condition in which it
leaves a man. The college course
is no accident. As every educator
known, its years are accompanied
by asystematic and visible develop
ment. Men change in the third
and fourth years after a fashion
which makes a junior and senior
more widely separated from the
year before than the development
of any years in a man's life. This
change itself registers the cumu
lative effect in stimulating and
cultivating which the college course
brings. Time is needed for this
ripening. A course abridged to

two years cannot give it. A propo
sition to reduce a college course to
these limits surrenders what makes
a college course valuable. Doubt
less it did not seem a surrender to
President Butler or he would not
have made the proposal; but doubt
less also it has so seemed to the
great body of men loyal to higher
education. The limit has been
reached. The reaction has begun.
The college course as a whole has
begun to assert its claims and has
justified its existence. If the col
leges have courage, the public will
accept their view and position.
