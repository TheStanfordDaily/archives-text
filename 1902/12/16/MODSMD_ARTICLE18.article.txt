# Captain Albertson Still Invalided.

### 
Captain W. B. Albertson of the
California Varsity has not yet re
covered from the injury to his knee
received in the intercollegiate game
five weeks ago. Owing to a compli
cation of water on the knee, rup
tured cartilages and strained liga
ments the doctors have been able
to do but little for him, and it is
not improbable that he will be
compelled to give up his chosen
profession of mining engineer.
