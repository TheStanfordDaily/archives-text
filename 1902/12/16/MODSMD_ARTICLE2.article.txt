# ROWING AT COLUMBIA
## Notable Progress from Small Beginning Has Characterized the Sport. 
### 
Among the letters received by
the Daily Palo Alto last semester
in response to requests for informa
tion as to rowing conditions at
Eastern universities, was one from
the manager of the crew at Colum
bia. So much of it can be applied
to the situation at Stanford that
the letter is reproduced in full:
"The buildings of the university,
as you may know, are situated
overlooking the Hudson River, and
it is after a five-minute walk from
the college that the boat-house is
reached. However, after the pre
liminary practice in the gymna
sium on the rowing machines dur
ing January and February, we find
the Hudson much too rough and
unsafe to row a shell upon until
the first of May. Hence we are
obliged during March and April to
resort to the Harlem for early
practice.
"The Harlem is some two miles
distant from college, and is sur
rounded by mud fiats with many
other unattractive features. It is
reached after a trip of some twenty
minutes from college, and the oars
man finds no boat-house to wel
come him. Each year we have the
same difficulty in finding quarters
on the Harlem. Sometimes some
local boat club lends us a very
small corner of its crowded,
cramped quarters, and sometimes
we keep our shells in a shed, and
the men have to dress around an
old stove at one end of it. But in
spite of the inconveniences and the
difficulties that we have to put up
with while the crews are rowing on
the Harlem, we do not find that
any oarsmen drop out, or that
there is any less enthusiasm among
the candidates. When we move
over to the Hudson everything is
plain sailing until we go to Pough
keepsie for the annual race with
Cornell and Pennsylvania.
"As to finances, the money nec
essary to maintain the crew is
raised entirely by subscription.
The alumni subscribe about one
third of the expenses, the three
upper classes in the university an
other third, and the freshmen the
final third. The freshmen's share
is such a heavy one because they
maintain an eight of their own for
the freshman race. This is almost
as expensive a crew as the varsity.
The freshmen help raise their share
by giving a theatrical show for the
benefit of their crew.
"However, in spite of all the ad
vantages which Columbia now pos
sesses of professional coach, luxuri
ous boat-house, and coaching
launch, rowing with us began on a
very small scale. Early in the
seventies, when the university was
situated well down in the heart of
the city, a few enthusiastic under
graduates used to make the trip of
six miles to the Harlem to take a
daily practice spin. They had no
coach, and at first borrowed a shell
until money enough was raised to
buy one. The perseverance of these
early oarsmen soon began to win
victories, and thus rowing at Co
lumbia became established as a

recognized sport. As time has
worn on, the crews have had each
year more and more advantages
and facilities, until now we have
all any crew could ever need.
These gifts have come largely from
alumni who were interested in row
ing while at college and who knew
and appreciated what was needed.
"To the students of Stanford
University Columbia wishes every
success in their efforts to establish
rowing as a college sport on the
Pacific Coast. Granted the neces
sary amount of rowing spirit and
enthusiasm to enable the men to
put up with the hardships and in
conveniences for the first few years,
and granted a popular interest in
rowing among all the students of
the University, we feel sure that
rowing at Stanford will be an estab
lished fact, because from our own
experience we know that rowing
can be instituted with a water
course six miles away, with no
coach or launches, and with an ex
cuse for a boat-house. You may
be sure that all these things will
come in time.
