# Acquires Dr. Richardson's Library.
## 
### 
The University has purchased
from the widow of Prof. G. M.
Richardson, late head of the Chem
istry department, the greater part
of his chemical library. The
library comprises between five and
six hundred volumes, containing
many rare and valuable works.
Particularly strong is the collection
on the history of chemistry and on
organic chemistry. The collection
has always been a valuable ac
cessory to the Chemical library of
the University, as it was freely ac
cessible to the students of chem
istry.
