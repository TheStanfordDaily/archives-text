# FOOTBALL PREPARATIONS
## Selection of Head Coach a Problem. Captain Will Introduce Spring Training. 
### 
The same problem confronts
Stanford as that of last year. The
choice of a head coach for the foot
hall season of 1903 must be made.
Already manager and captain have
begun to cast a watchful eye over
possible material. The outlook is
far from encouraging, owing to the
fact that most of the men who have
figured prominently in Stanford
football are not easy of access.
Nothing definite has been accom
plished in regard to the man who
will head the list of coaches for the
coming season, but in all probabil
ity Frank Slaker will again act as
assistant coach. There is a unani
mous sentiment in favor of engag
ing him again. The ex-fullback
is willing to return.
Captain-elect Bansbach has al
ready laid plans for preliminary
training. In conformity with the
practice at the big Eastern colleges
lie intends to hold light spring work
for the backs and ends. Next
semester the available material for
the back-field will practice starting,
light tackling, and kicking, in order
to develop fast running backs, and
a strong, sure punter.
