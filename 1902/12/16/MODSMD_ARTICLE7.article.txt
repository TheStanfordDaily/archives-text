# Second Team May Play.
## 
### 
There is a possibility that the
Second team may play the Indians
in Los Angeles on Christmas Day.
The preliminary arrangements had
heen made and the consent of the
Faculty Athletic Committee se
cured, when all negotiations were
held pending the receipt of a tele
gram from J. F. Sheehan, '95, who
is conducting the Southern end of
the agreement. There is some un
certainty in regard to the Indians
playing again this season, and until
there is confirmation of the original
report nothing definite can be an
nounced.
