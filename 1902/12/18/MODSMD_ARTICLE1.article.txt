## Prospects for a Winning Team Brought Out by Fall Practice. 
### 
The preliminary baseball prac
tice which closed last week gave
evidence that Stanford will be rep
resented in the contest with Cali
fornia next spring by a team far
above the average Stanford nine.
For every position on the field there
will be a hot contest. In addition
to the eight men of last year's team
who are still in collcge, there are
any number of likely candidates
capable of playing rattling good
ball.
One of the most gratifying results
brought about by the fall practice
was the appearance of many fresh
man aspirants. During the early
part of the season at least thirty
five '06 men were daily appearing
for work.
The preliminary practice this
year has been in the nature of an
experiment. Heretofore only a day
or two in the fall has been utilized
to get an idea of the size and qual
ity of the squad. The time was ex
tended this year to give the old
men a chance to get back into the
baseball habit, and to enable the
neophytes to overcome their stage
fright. The results are very grati
fying to Captain Brown. He has
succeeded in getting the men into
a shape that will mean a great
deal when practice is resumed in
January.
In was found inadvisable tohave
any regular games, and the daily
work was confined entirely to light
practice in picking up grounders
and in easy base-throwing. Toward
the end considerable attention was
devoted to batting, with the result
that the team has good prospects
of developing into a batting nine,
a condition not reached at Stan
ford for several years.
Next semester the squad will be
called out about January 12th.
Coach Swindells is to be on hand
to begin work. Wire cages are to
be put up for the use ofÂ« the bats
men, and continuous experience in
meeting the ball is to be a part of
the daily program.
To further safe and hard hitting
there is some talk on the part of
the management of offering a tro
phy to the player who gets the best
batting average for the season.
None of the new men have
shown up particularly well this
season. The Freshman class has
some good material that may de
velop into Varsity form with a year
or two of experience.
The list of candidates for the
different infield positions is as fol
lows: Catcher, McGilvray, '04, Ball,
'03; pitcher, Parker, '03, Tritch,
'04, Sales, '06, Colbert, '06, Wil
liams, '06; first base, Blake, '04,
Cowden, '02, captain of last year's
nine; Ball, '04, Colbert, '06; second
base, Cowden, '02, Litt, '06, Lewis,
'06; third base, Captain Brown, '03,
Copp, '03, Ball, '04; short stop,
Crawford, '03. For the outfield
there are Lowenthal, '03, Knight,
'03, Doherty, '04, Tritch, '04, and a
large number of new men.
In every way the prospects for
next semester are bright. There will
face California a team of veterans.
