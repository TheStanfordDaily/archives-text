The contemplated Southern trip
of the Second football eleven is not
an enterprise to be enthused over.
From no view-point does it give
evidence of being justified by either
necessity or policy. It cannot be
urged by the members of the eleven
that a trip is due them-the score was
settled by the Thanksgiving journey
to Tuolumne. Neither is there rea
son to hope that the team which
scored two touchdowns on the State
University could be defeated or
even effectively opposed by Stan
ford's reserve eleven. The prospect
of defeat, it must be admitted,
should not deter a team from ar
ranging a match provided there is
a hope of ultimate benefit. But it
is inevitable that this contest will
be advertised throughout Southern
California as one in which
the University will be represented
by its ablest team. Manage
rial protest notwithstanding, it
is seemingly impossible to pre
vent unscrupulous promoters
from using the Stanford name care
lessly. The prominent feature of
the poster used to advertise the
Thanksgiving match at Carters
was a sprawling "Stanford," with
nothing to indicate that it was not
the Varsity which was to play.
It is excursions like the one con
templated by the Second eleven
that give point to the criticisms of
opponents of post-season games.
