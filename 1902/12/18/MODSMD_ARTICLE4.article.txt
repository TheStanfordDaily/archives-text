# Transfer to New Chemistry Building.
## 
### 
Next Monthly morning the assist
ant corps of the Chemistry depart
ment, aided by students, will begin
moving the apparatus and chera

icals from the old post-office, where
they are now stored, to the store
rooms of the new laboratory. The
apparatus and chemicals of the
new stock will also be unpacked.
Some of the desks and the lecture
table will be moved from the old
classroom to complete the equip
ment of the new, but it is not ex
pected that work can in the
new laboratory in January. Nec
essary work will be begun in the
old quarters the first of next semes
ter, but it seems probable that the
class in Elementary Chemistry will
not be able to begin until the new
building is occupied. The Assay
ing course will also be deferred
until then. The department hopes
to get started on these courses by
the first of February. The course
in Short Methods of Quantitative
Analysis will be given in the old
Quantitative laboratory.
