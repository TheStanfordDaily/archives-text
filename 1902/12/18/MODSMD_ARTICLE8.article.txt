# BOOKER T. WASHINGTON.
## Remarkable Career of Negro Leader Who is to Speak at Next Assembly. 
### 
The San Francisco Chronicle has
the following to Bay regarding
Booker T. Washington,who is to he
the speaker at the next University
Assembly, January Bth:
"Booker T. Washington, the
'negro Moses,' as his people call
him, is a self-made man. Born a
slave, his father's name unknown
to him, he has risen superior to
the bonds of race prejudice, from
obscurity to the foremost position
of his race in America. The kindly
interest taken in him by a school
teacher led to his learning to read
at an early age. Circumstances,
however, drove him to the coal
mines, where he worked for some
time. He might have been there
yet but for an accident which
directed his attention to a school
for young negroes founded by Gen
eral Armstrong at Hampton, Va.,
where he was subsequently given
an opportunity to work for his
board. His main idea was that of
entering the profession of the law,
but at the suggestion of General
Armstrong,who foresaw his destiny,
Washington resolved to devote
himself to the task of teaching his
race to help itself. After leaving
Hampton he went to Tuskegee,
where he opened a small school in
a tumbledown shanty. With a
capital of but $2000, which he bor
rowed from the secretary of Hamp
ton, he started an industrial insti
tute similar to that at which he
had been educated. Within a
comparatively few years this grew
to such proportions that today it
comprises a tract of 2400 acres of
land with thirty-eight buildings,
valued at $250,000, which is carried
on at an annual cost of $75,000.
Over 900 students from nineteen
States are gathered there, and they
pursue almost every known branch
of industry. As a spontaneous
recognition of the noble struggle he
had made for his race, Harvard
University conferred the honorary
degree of Master of Arts upon
Booker T. Washington in 1897,
upon which occasion he was styled
by the collegians 'a man eminent
in the art of teaching; a helper of
his race; a noble servant of God
and of his country.' "
