# "Chappie" in Christmas Dress.

### 
What the editors have combined
to make an attractive Christmas
Chaparral will appear tomorrow.
It might almost be called a "pretty
girl" number, for Stanford has
never before seen under one cover
such a collection of beauties of the
artist's pen. R. W. Borough, ex-'Ol,
is the creator of most of them, his
full-page drawing being especially
fine. The first poem is "Christmas
Reveries in Encina," by W. J.
Stack, '03. Clever Christmas verse
is also contributed by C. S. Thomp
son, '03, and Irene A. Wright, '04.
The editorials deal with the
career of the athlete in politics, the
dedication of the new Gym, and
the discussion concerning conversa
tion in the Library. The prose
stories and jokes are up to the
standard.
