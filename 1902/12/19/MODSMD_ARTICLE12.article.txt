first volume of the Daily Palo
Alto. In the semester's work the
editor has been aided by a staff

have been so constantly demon

privilege to have an opportunity of
acknowledgment. Regret at reach

a task is tempered by the
realization that the paper's pros
pects for the next half-year are
bright. Whatever success the
"Daily" has attained for several
semesters past is largely due to
T. E. Stephenson. His name at
the head of this column will be a
guarantee of adequacy and im
provement.
