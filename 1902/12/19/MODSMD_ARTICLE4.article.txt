It has been the policy of the Stu
dents' Guild in the past to assist
only (hose students who were un
able to pay their own expenses ii\
time of sickness, and in this way
large hospital bills were undertaken
which so diminished the amount in
the treasury that other work was
impossible.
This year the board of the Guild
has determined that more good can
be done to the student body in
general and the Guild members in
particular by confining the efforts
of the Guild to the more com
mon ills of the students. Next
semester (he Guild stands prepared
to furnish those members who are
ill sick-room outfits and nurses,
together with (he simpler house
hold remedies. The membership
fee, as in the past, will be fifty cents
a semester.
