# No Game at Los Angeles.
## 
### 
In all probability there will be
no game between the Stanford
Second eleven and the Perris
Indians in Los Angeles on New
Year's Day. Negotiations have
been pending for some time, await
ing a telegram from J. Sheehan,
'95, tlie Southern manager, that the
game would take place. At noon
today, no word having been re
ceived, Captain Blodget informed
his men that they might consider
the contest declared off. Even if
Sheehan should wish the team to
play it would be almost impossible
for it to do so, as many of the
players have left the University for
the holidays, and could not be in
duced to return for the game.
