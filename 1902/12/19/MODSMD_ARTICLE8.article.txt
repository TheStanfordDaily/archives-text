# New University Souvenir.

### 
A book that will set the stand
ard for pictorial souvenirs of Stan
ford University for a long time to
come has appeared from the press
of the W. F. Robinson Co. of Den
ver. It is made up of about thirty
five large engravings, with an equal
number of smaller ones, from pho
tographs taken by J. Collier, a
Denver artist, during a two months'
stay on the campus this semester.
The views have been chosen with
rare artistic taste, and the arrange
ment leaves nothing to be desired.
The interior of the Memorial
Church, the windows, carvings,
and mosaics, present a par
ticularly difficult task to the
photographer, owing to the lack of
light and the intricacy of detail.
The result as shown in the cuts
verifies the prediction of the artist
made when at Stanford that his
work in this particular will never
be improved upon.
The book contains a short, well
written introductory article, and a
description of the Memorial Church
by the architect, Clinton Day, of
San Francisco. Mechanically the
work is almost perfect. The cuts
are clear and effective. The whole
appears in an appropriate dress of
soft cardinal matting. The tinting
in general is excellent, though not
always applied with the greatest
judgment.
The edition is limited to 3,000
copies, and with the present de
mand bids fair to be soon exhaust
ed. The second sale opened late
yesterday afternoon, and already
several hundred copies have been
sold.
