# SEMESTER'S TRACK WORK.
## A 						Review of Fall Training Shows Satisfactory Progress Among the Athletes. 
### 
The fall semester closes leaving a
considerable amount of satisfaction
among the track enthusiasts. The
student body at large has little
idea of the amount of hard work
that during the last three months
has been done within the fence that
surrounds the cinder-path.
As a rule something over fifty
men each day have exercised under
the eyes of the trainer, or the cap
tain, or a veteran track man. Nor
man Dole has been taking care of
the pole-vaulters, Dunn and Thom
son of the quarter and half-mile
men, Gay and Holman of the dis
tance men, and Hyde and Crawford
of the weight men. Trainer Moul
ton since the closing of the football
season has devoted his entire atten
tion to track athletics. Several
of the men have been taken regu
larly into the rubbing-room, but as
a rule no particular attention has
been paid to sore muscles or the
conditioning of the men. The
trainer has attempted to instill into
the men enthusiasm for their
events. He has, as last year, been
preaching the doctrine of determin
ation, that is never satisfied with
anything except a first place.
The progress during the semester
has been pleasing. Many of the
rough edges are worn off; and the
men are prepared to begin, the
first week of next semester, a strict
adherence to training regulations,
and a specialization in their own
particular events.
A large number of the men who
signed up in September have never
appeared for instruction; others
have come out within the last six
weeks.
All of last year's men who have
been out have done good work. The
pole-vaulters, Whitaker, J. M.
Beach, and Norman Dole, and the
high jumpers, Abbott and Beach,
have trained consistently. The
weight men, also, have kept up
their work. Hyde has been putting
the shot over forty-one feet without
exertion. Crawford is throwing
the hammer much better than last
year. Estes, the San Jose fresh
man, has been out a few times and
has shown up very well. Turpin
on Wednesday ran a trial in the
hundred close to 10 1-5 seconds.
"Dad" Moulton said today: "I
want to thank the men for the
spirit they have shown. I want
every one who has been out this fall
and every other man who is sound
in limb and body, to get out early
next semester and stay with it un
til the middle of April."
