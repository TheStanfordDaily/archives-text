The Daily Palo AltO, which
with this issue begins its twenty
second volume, has been and alway√ü
will be an exponent of student ac
tivities. It should first of all voice
the sentiment of the student body:
it should be representative of Stan
ford life and aims. No other under
graduate enterprise so thoroughly
shows the efficiency of an institu
tion as do its student publications.
In the past the Daily Palo Alto
has maintained a higher standard
than our student body has deserved;
the editor too often has been com
pelled by the scarcity of material
from which to choose his associates
and assistants to put on the list at
the head of the editorial column
the names of all applicants, hoping
that at some time they might be
useful to him. As a consequence,
a position on the staff has not
always meant what it should
mean. This condition has been
in some measure obviated by the
attitude of the last three editors.
Each semester the competition for
positions on the board has been
closer. In furtherance of this pol
icy it has been suggested that the
number of associates and assistants
be limited. The time for so doing
has not yet arrived, there not being
applicants sufficient to warrant the
editor in taking the step. But a
greater amount of work and a
greater proficiency in the doing of
it than ever before will be demand
ed this semester. The appearance
of a name at the head of this col
umn will show that the bearer of
it has earned his position, that ho
has attained a certain amount of
proficiency in the collection of
news and in the writing of it.
Every applicant will be tried; those
who make the staff will be ranked
according to value. Those who de
sire to connect themselves with the
Daily may do so at any time.
Positions will be awarded only
after a period of probation.
It is the duty of each editor to
make the Daily Palo Alto a bet
ter newspaper, more representative
of conditions and ideals at Stanford;

and to furnish to those who work on
it greater remuneration in the oppor
tunities for practical experience.
That it has done these things the
past semester more consistently
than ever before is due to the con
scientious work of Thoreau Cronyn,
who was its editor-in-chief. He
maintained throughout an editorial
dignity and thoroughness creditable
both to himself and to the Univer
sity. A high standard has been
set, and to gain a higher the sup
port of the student body and fac
ulty will be necessary. There
should be a more universal recog
nition of the fact that the Daily
Palo Alto is "of, by, with, and for
the students."
