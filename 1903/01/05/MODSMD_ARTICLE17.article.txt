Returning students have ex
pressed considerable dissatisfaction
over the sudden change made in
rates by the Palo Alto liverymen.
The increase of one hundred and
fifty per cent in the fare from the
station to different points on the
campus is considered exorbitant,
though it is recognized that the
stablemen may fix their prices as
they please and we may walk or
ride accordingly. But the fact
that the drivers never fail to take
advantage of the enforced ignorance
of those who get off the train into
their carriages seems to show that
a repetition of the program carried
out by them a few semesters ago
will be had. At that time the
change in rates proved to be noth
ing more than a subterfuge for
fleecing as many students as possi
ble. There is a feeling that the
present rates are but temporary.
Whether so or not, the presence of
a system countenancing an inter
mittent disregard for business in
tegrity is to be deplored.
