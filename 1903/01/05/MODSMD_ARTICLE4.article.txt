# Vacation on the Campus.
## 
### 
A larger number of students than
usual remained on the campus dur
ing vacation and consequently
social affairs occupied a place of
importance. On December 22d
Roble entertained the men of En
cina with a taffy-pull at Roble.
New Year's Eve the women of
Roble, Madrono, and the four
sororities united in giving a dance
at the Delta Gamma house. Delta
Upsilon gave an "at home'' and
Sigma Chi a smoker; and last Sat
urday the Phi Delta Theta house
was turned over to Encitia men for
an informal dance.
