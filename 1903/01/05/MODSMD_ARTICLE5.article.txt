# CHALLENGE FROM BALTIMORE.
## Johns Hopkins University Desires to Meet Stanford Men in Series of Annual Debates. 
### 
J. H. Page, '03, president of the
Intersociety Debating League, is in
receipt of a challenge from the
Johns Hopkins University for a
series of debates with Stanford.
Dr. Guy Carlton Lee, of the faculty
of the Eastern institution, sends the
proposal, and suggests that the
first contest occur at Stanford in
April. The intention is to have
three debates: one each at Stanford
and Baltimore, and a third at a
place selected jointly hy the two
universities.
Dr. LeB wishes to restrict the
contests at Stanford to under
graduates, notwithstanding the
fact that Johns Hopkins is almost
entirely a postgraduate school. In
addition, he mentions their desire
to have three debaters on a side,
the choice of a question this year
to go to the Stanford men.
The Stanford Debating League
will meet this week to consider the
proposed offer from Baltimore, after
which a formal answer will be sent
to Dr. Lee.
