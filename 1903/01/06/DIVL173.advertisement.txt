Hie Department ot Music of the Thoburn School.
Wo call the attention of students who desire
to continue their study of music while at the
University to the excellent department of
music of the Thoburn School at Palo Alto.
This new department of the promising young
institution is directed by Mr. Arthur Fioken
scher, who teaches piano and harmony, the in
struction in vocal music being in the hands of
Mrs. FicUenscher. Mr. Fickenscher does not
need an introduction to the faculty and students
of Stanford. Ho is recognized as ono of the
foremost pianists and teachers of music on the
Pacific Coast. As a composer, he ranks among
the first in this country. In her recent visit to
San Francisco, Frau Schumann Tfeinck, the
famous contralto, asked it as a special favor
that Mr. Fickenscher dedicate several of his
songs to her.
To bo instructed by an artist like Mr. Ficken
scher is a privi ege of which many will gladly
avail themselves.
