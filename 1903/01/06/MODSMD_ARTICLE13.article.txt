The Students' Guild has re
organized and starts out this semes
ter with the intention of becoming
more effective and reaching a
larger number of individuals than
ever before. In the past its policy
has been a poor one. The changes
made have all been for the best.
It has taken upon itself a new form,
with more systematic control of its
finances, extending greater privi
leges to its members. The Guild
deserves the support of every
student. With its present corps of
officers it may be depended upon
to do effective work.
