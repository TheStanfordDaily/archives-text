Stanford sympathizers cannot
but feel a large amount of satisfac
tion over the attitude taken by
Caspar Whitney in the January
Outing in regard to the Smith
controversy. His comments are a
thorough vindication of the posi
tion taken by our faculty and stu
dent body. Across the bay there
was the feeling that our cause was
unjust; that the ruling of the Pacific
Athletic Association once delivered
should have been submitted to,
however erroneous it might have
been. Mr. Whitney has the follow
ing to say, speaking first of the
arbitration committee:
The unanimous decision of such
a representative committee must
have a salutary effect in clarifying
the confused idea of legitimate ath
letic expenses existing on the Pa
cific Coast. And of still greater
importance is the decision that the
university faculties, and not the
P. A. A., are to decide what consti
tutes an amateur in intercollegiate
contests.
The Pacific Athletic Association
has on its roll of membership sev
eral clubs whoso gymnasium is lim
ited almost entirely to punching
bags, skipping-ropes, and six-ounce
gloves, and whose paying members
consist chiefly of the clubs' "back
ers." Among these organizations
are the Hayes Valley Athletic
Club, which promoted the cham
pionship fight between those emi
nent amateurs Messrs. Fitzsimmons
and Jeffries; and the San Francisco
Athletic Club, which has been
seeking "to foster and improve am
ateur athletics" by bringing Messrs.

Gardner and Jackson together in
a twenty-foot ring before a highly
remunerative gathering. That a
great institution like the Univer
sity of California should have per
mitted its standard of amateurism
to be set by an organization which
counts these "slugger clubs" among
its members, is little to the credit
of the athletic authorities of the
university, and the gentlemen of
the University Club are to be
congratulated for finally determin
ing that the big California univer
sities must each settle the status of
its own athletes in accordance with
the terms of their intercollegiate
agreement.
