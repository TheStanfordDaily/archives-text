# Proposed Change in Football Rules.
## 
### 
There is a growing sentiment in
college circles throughout the
country in favor of the abolition ol
the mass plays in football, and
pressure will be brought to bear
upon the intercollegiate football
rules committee to that effect.
Walter Camp, chairman of the
committee, is making investigations,
and it is expected that a meeting
of the committee will be called
sometime this month.
