# The
						Stanford "Alumnus."
## 
### 
It is no small credit to a publi
cation which caters to the absent
.that it'is also of interest
to the undergraduate who is still
on thecampUBin touch with Uni
versity life and thought. The
Stanford Alumnus each month
adds some jvew feature and im
provement, asid'is now issued on
time. In the, January number Dr.
W. F. Snow has an article on "The
Old Gym and the New," illustrated
with a view from the architect's
plans. There is also an account of
the cornerstone ceremonies accred
ited to the Daily Palo Ai/ro. The
proposition o.fythe "pioneer chiss"
to lay a brass plate in the arcade
before Memorial Church is elabo
rated in an article entitled "The
'95 Class Plate." J. Mori con
tributes an interpretation of "Mrs.
Stanford's Japanese Collection."
There is a Hh&rif/ history of the
Class of '92, illustrated by a cut
from an old photograph. Alto
gether the number is satisfactory,
the best yet gotten out, and when
greater attention is paid to the
proofreading, and small matters of
fact, the magazine will be fully
worthy of a high place among the
alumnus journals of the country,
rnpid strides toward which have
been made under the present man
agement.
