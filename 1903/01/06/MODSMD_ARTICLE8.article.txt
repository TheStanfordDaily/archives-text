# GUILD REORGANIZES.
## Under the New System the Sick Will Receive More Judicious Attention than Hitherto. 
### 
With the opening of the new
semester the Students' Guild begins
to putin practice a system much
more liable to meet the demands
of the ordinary student than the
one just abandoned by them. Prior
to the present change the work of
the Guild has been confined en
tirely to the lending of money to
pay the hospital fees of impecunious
students, whether or not they were
Guild members. In addition there
were free dispensaries maintained
in Roble, Encina, and The Camp,
where simple remedies were given
to all applicants. Owing to lack
of funds it was found impossible to
meet all the calls for assistance.
Through mismanagement the dis
pensaries degenerated until the
system was almost valueless.
The present board of directors
has taken drastic steps toward rev
olutionizing the work the Guild
will do. A separate fund, com
posed of voluntary donations, has
been laid aside to meet the demands
for hospital service, a feature which,
while overworked in the past, can
not be overlooked. The most im
portant branch of the Guild's work,
however, will be along other lines.
The beneficiaries will be members
of the Guild only. To them there
will be no charge for services ren
dered. The impossibility of pro
viding a doctor in each case of
sickness is recognized, and as a
consequence the Guild will not
attempt to do so. Membership
will entitle a student to the simple
remedies he can with safety apply
himself, or, in more serious cases,
to a "sick-room outfit," an equip
ment which will satisfactorily
change the ordinary room into a
miniature hospital. Upon the
recommendation of the resident
physician a nurse will be provided
and messenger service supplied.
Thus the securing of meals, which
is the greatest difficulty the dormi
tory student has to contend with,
will be provided for.
Ah usual, the semester fee is fifty
cents. New members will be ad
mitted during the present month.
