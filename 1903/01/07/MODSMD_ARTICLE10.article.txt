The challenge for a debate from
Johns Hopkins University will re
ceive the attention of the Inter-
Bociety Debating League sometime
this week. Whether the project
will meet with favorable considera
tion is doubtful, but the result of
the offer of the Eastern institution
promises well for the future of
Stanford's debating interests. It
shows that it is possible for our
field to embrace institutions on
both Coasts. This branch of stu
dent activity at Stanford should
receive an impetus of no mean pro
portions. The outlook is very en
couraging. It iB unfortunate that
conditions this year point to a re
fusal of the challenge from John√ü
Hopkins, for with the Carnot and
Intercollegiate and the debate with
Washington in prospect, Stanford
debaters will have as much as they
can do. Hut we should aim to
broaden our field. We should con
sciously work with the intention of
sometime in the future meeting the
orators from the other side of the
continent.

With the semester which is to
see the final effort of the Class
of 1903 fairly launched, it may
not seem impertinent at this junc
ture to remind the prospective
graduates that the class treasury
is more than empty, and that the
great bulk of Senior assessments
remain unpaid. Next week comes
the nomination of oflicers, and
within a fortnight the election. By
a decree of the class, balloting will
be restricted to those who have paid
the one-dollar levy by means of
which Naught-three hopes to free
itself from the lingering Quad debt,
in order to be able to do justice to
itself later in the semester. The
assessment offers a means of escape
from an embarrassing situation.
Nothing can be accomplished by
evasion, and much may be gained
if delinquent members look imme
diately to the meeting of their obli
gations.
