## 
### 
There has been considerable re
arrangement of the lockers and
apparatus in Encina Gymnasium.
All the lockers formerly in the
gallery have been moved down
stairs. They have been distrib
uted along Ihe main hall of the
locker room and along the front
wall. The hall will be painted
white. Benches have been placed
along the wall. The special ap
paratus, rowing machines, and
horizontal ladder have been moved
to the end of the gallery where the
lockers stood. This leaves a large
part of the gallery free for boxing,
wrestling, and fencing.
