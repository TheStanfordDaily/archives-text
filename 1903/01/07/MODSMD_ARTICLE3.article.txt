# UNIVERSITY ASSEMBLY.
## Booker T. Washington of the Tuskegee Institute Will Address the Students Tomorrow Morning at 10:15. 
### 
Tomorrow at the third hour the
first University Assembly of the
semester will he held. A large
number of visitors from Palo Alto
and neighboring towns are expected.

The press caused by the over
crowding of the main drill hall has
been greatly relieved by taking
several pieces of apparatus to the
gallery. The vaulting-bar will be
moved to the upper end of the drill
hall where the horizontal ladder
formerly stood. By this change
the large handball court will be
left entirely free. The tumbling
mat has been "tufted," and all the
mats cleaned and repaired. The
buck has been mended and all the
apparatus has been putin the best
of condition.

No seats will be reserved. The
speaker, Booker T. Washington,
will spend most of the day on the
campus. He will be entertained by
Mrs. Stanford.
