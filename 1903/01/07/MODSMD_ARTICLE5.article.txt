The Pacific Coast Conference of
the Y. M. C. A. assembled at Pa
cific Grove December '26th, and
continued in session for ten days.
The conference was in every way a
success. One hundred and ten del
egates, representing nearly all the
colleges of the Coast, were regis
tered. There were thirty-six dele
gates from the State University,
twenty-seven from Stanford, thir
teen from Occidental, and propor
tionate representation from the
smaller colleges.
Every morning were held a mis
sionary institute, Bible-study nor
mal classes, the Association confer
ence, and a public platform ad
dress by some speaker who has
gained prominence in the pulpit or
elsewhere. Among the speakers
were Dr. Chapman of Los Angeles,
Rev. W. K. Guthrie, and Professor
Nash of San Francisco. The confer
ence faculty members, E. T. Colton,
international secretary; E. G. Hig
gins, general secretary of the Har
vard Association; C. S. Cooper,
Bible-study secretary of students'
department; and Arthur Pugh,
secretary of the Student Volunteer
Movement, also gave addresses.
"Life-work" meetings were held
every evening, at which men suc
cessful in various callings presented
their various professions to the stu
dents, assisting them to choose
more intelligently their life work.
The afternoons were devoted en
tirely to recreation. Among the
features of entertainment were the
tramps to the Del Monte Hotel
and around the seventeen-mile
drive. Baseball games between the
various colleges, and the New
Year's field-day aroused great in
terest among the delegates. The
baseball championship went to the
Southern colleges, while Berkeley
carried off the tield-dav honors,
Stanford coming in second and Oc
cidental third. Turpin and Har
ter of Stanford won the 50- and
100-yard dashes, against the track
team of Occidental. All who at
tended were much pleased with the
Conference.
