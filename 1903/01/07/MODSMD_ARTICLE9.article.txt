Considerable dissatisfaction has
been expressed over the fact that
the Committee on Scholarship has
dropped students without giving
the customary warning. There has
been a general feeling that there
was a set rule not allowing of such
action. In practice the committee
has never tied itself down to any
rule or set of rules. Each case is
treated individually. But a very
few feel the ax who have not pre
viously been given a chance to
raise the standard of their work;
when the necessity arises the com
mittee does not hesitate to exert its
authority. Several of the fifty
three unfortunates who this semes
ter will not register at Stanford as
cribe their downfall to the lack of
opportunity to remove deficiencies.
That a false impression concerning
a matter so serious should have be
come general is much to be de
plored. The misunderstanding
should have been corrected long
ago.
