# ADDRESS AT ASSEMBLY.
## Booker T. Washington Talks Before a Large and Enthusiastic Audience. 
### 
One of the most interesting ad
dresses ever delivered at Stanford
was that given by Booker T. Wash
ington in Assembly Hall this
morning. The building was packed,
a large number of visitors from
surrounding towns having come to
hear him.
Mr. Washington met the expec
tations of those in the audience
who had heard of him but who had
never before seen him. His man
ner of presentation was pleasing
and forceful. Many of his remarks
and illustrations were greeted with
enthusiastic applause. Contribu
tions to go to Tuskegee Institute,
amounting to $374.36, were taken
in at the doors.
Dr. Branner introduced Mr.
Washington, who spoke as follows:
The colored people of this coun
try contend with some disadvan
tages, but they enjoy one or two
advantages also. They are the
only race that ever had a special, a
personal, and an emphatic invita
tion to come to this country. Your
race came against the vigorous
protest of all the inhabitants of
this country at the time of its dis
covery. We were sent for. 1 have
sometimes in these latter days
heard it urged that the right way
to settle the "negro question" is for
the negro to return to Africa, to the
land of his fathers. The negro is
here to stay, and the problem of
his development must be worked
out right on the ground where he
is. I believe that with God's help
there is yet patience enough and
courage enough and Christianity
enough among us to work out this
problem.
I can do but a small part toward
solving this question. I was born
a slave somewhere in Virginia,
sometime during the years 1858-59.
I remember when I was set free.
Later I entered the school at Hamp
ton. I had a surplus of fifty cent 6
in my pocket to begin my educa
tion with. I was put into a dusty
room to sweep and clean it, and
when the teacher came in to try it
she could not soil a handkerchief
on the walls or furniture. That
was my entrance examination. In
that school my Christian teachers
helped me to work out my own
salvation.
When 1 was through 1 went down
into the "black belt" of Alabama.
It is here that the real difficulty of
the race problem most uncompro
misingly confronts us. This prob
lem is not for the black man only.
It is the white man's problem as
well; and not merely the problem
of the South, but of the whole na
tion, for the nation was responsible
for negro slavery.
in 1881 I settled in the little vil
lage of Tuskegee, Ala., and opened
a school in a twelve-by-fifteen
shanty. The school has grown
until we now have under instruc
tion 1400 students.
The instruction is industrial, to
make good tradesmen and workers;
normal, to fit good teachers to go
out among our own race and help
build them up in their common

life; and religious, for the strength
ening of their souls. But to carry
on the school and teach the 1400
students now crowding to us, I
have to raise annually about $80,-
000 or $90,000. At Tuskegee we
try to teach our people the dignity
and beauty and helpfulness of
labor. We try to show them the
vast difference between being
worked and working.
Nearly eighty per cent of the col
ored people of the South make their
living by some sort of agriculture.
Hence we teach farming in our
school. When corn comes to mar
ket one bushel raised in lowa is
worth just as much as one bushel
raised in Alabama. What sort of
a chance has a poor black man
with his tumble-down plow and
his discouraged mule? We must
teach him to raise his corn like his
competitor, the white man.
Years ago, after several unsuc
cessful trials, we began to make
brick there. We got bricks, but
they were a rather shaky lot. Now
we make over 2,000,000 bricks at
the school every year, and supply
more than four-fifths of the bricks
used in that part of the country â€”
and they are good bricks.
We found our people living in
poor ways in their homes, and have
taught our girls how to cook and
sew and keep house. Our aim has
been to put into ihe minds of our
students that the right way to be
happy themselves and to have suc
cess is to make some other human
being more happy and more useful.
The unselfishness of the missionary
spirit goes with their other educa
tion.
To understand the sort of work
they are called upon to do when
they go out among their own peo
ple, you must realize the conditions
under which they find them living.
Almost always a negro family will
be found on a rented place and in
debt. On this debt he will be pay
ing all the way from fifteen to forty
per cent interest yearly; and the
consequence is that they come out
in debt at the end. In the old
slave days the negroes never
thoughi it wrong to put "massa's
chicken" into "massa's nigger."
The present moral conditions
among the people are only to be
improved by teaching them to live
in better homes, to work and to live
in decency and comfort.
This is the work that the gradu
ates of Hampton and Tuskegee and
other schools are doing. They are
learning from their instruction
that it is their duty and privilege
to go out and help lift up their own
people; to aid in the redemption of
your country and my country.
I believe in industrial education.
The black man needs it not only
for the physical benefits it will
bring him, but for the moral
strengthening it gives. It teaches
him self-reliance and self-help and
gives him self-respect.
The colored man when he is re
ligious is apt to yield utterly to his
feelings. Hut the enthusiasm that
white men sometimes complain of
will yield in part to better educa
tion, and his mind will not give
way to excitement so readily when
he has been trained in self-control.
We should judge a race as a

nation, not by the worst it produces
but by the best. There are whole
communities now in the South
where the signs tangibly, visibly,
and indisputably show that the
negro can make a good citizen.
I am often asked what influence
will the education of the colored
people have upon their relations
with the white race. In this con
nection it is one of the encouraging
signs that Southern white men
seem to have no prejudice against
the colored man in business. If a
black man keeps a good grocery
store or a good shoe shop the white
man will patronize him. If he
makes a success of farming white
farmers come to see how he does it.
The Russian, the Indian, the
Cuban and the negro have had to
feel the bitterness of bondage in
the past. The negro answered by
midnight prayers for deliverance,
by the comfort of religion, by faith
fulness, by trust in God and by
patience. With this same trust
and patience we yet look for the
complete redemption of our people.
