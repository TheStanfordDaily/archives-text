Tomorrow at 1:30 those who
wish to try for positions on the
Daily Palo Alto staff will meet
in the office. A number of new
men have signified their intention
of taking up the work, and some of
them have already commenced.
The benefit to be derived from a
connection with the paper is lim
ited only by the amount of time
and work put in. Every organiza
tion, every undergraduate enter
prise should have upon our board
the name of some man or woman
who is vitally interested in the
work of the organization or enter
prise. Applicants will be given a
fair trial. Those who show that
they want to do serious work
throughout the semester, who dis
play proficiency and newspaper
instinct, will be added to the assist
ant list after a month's probation.
