It was said in last night's Daily
Palo Alto that three hundred and
ten regular students and sixty-five
specials were warned last semester,
that one out of every eight regulars
warned, and one out of every four
specials warned were dropped. Last
semester only sixty-five warnings
were sent out. One out of every
eight regulars in the University,
one out of every four specials, were
warned.
