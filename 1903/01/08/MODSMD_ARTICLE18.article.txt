Editor Daily Palo Alto:
There seems to be a general mis
understanding concerning the
Senior class assessment. This
assessment, although levied to settle
the affairs of the 1903 Quad, will
not be devoted to that alone. The
sum was made one dollar in order
that the class might have a bal
ance with which to prepare for
Senior Week. In order that this
object may not be defeated it is
important that all members of '03
pay their dues at once.
R. C. McComish, Treas. 1903.
