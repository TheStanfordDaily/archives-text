# BASEBALL OUTLOOK.
## Return of Last Year's Varsity Players Gives Promise of Successful Season's Play. 
### 
On the fifteenth of the month
spring baseball practice will begin.
Promptly at four o'clock us usual
there will be daily work under the
coaching of C. J. Swindells, '02,
who has been engaged to take
charge of the baseball squad. Swin
dells was on the campus yesterday,
and will return next week to start
the season's practice. Both the
coach and Captain Brown are
optimistic over the outlook. With
the exception of Pitcher McFarland
and right fielder Kellogg, last year's
Varsity has suffered no losst. j.
With a Varsity man for every posi
tion and an influx of new material
of a high order there is every rea
son to feel encouraged.
In all probability there will be
many shifts in last year's line-up
before the spring games are finished.
For every position there are several
candidates, which ensures a hard
struggle. Parker, last year's Var
sity pitclier, will have to compete
with "Jimmy" Tritch, '04, Sales, a
freshman from Denver,and "Teddy"
Roosevelt, '03, who has registered
for University work. Roosevelt ia
an exceptional pitcher but is still
suffering from the injuries which
he received in the Michigan game
over a year ago. Bruce Ball, '03,
who caught on the '01 Varsity team,
is back in college. The struggle
between him and McGilvray for
the catcher's position will be sharp
as both men are good with the
stick, field well, and throw to bases
in good shape. Blake at first,
Cowden, last year's captain, at
second, Crawford at short,and Copp
at third have all returned. None
of these men feel that they have
their positions secure and realize
that they will be shifted as the best
interests of the nine demand. Last
year's outfield —Captain Brown,
Knight, and Lowenthal —are all
back. Besides the old men are
many freshmen who have shown
up well in fall practice but upon
whom no line can be drawn until
the season is further along.
The outline of the season's work
includes a program whose most im
portant features will be practice in
batting and base running. Stick
work was the weakness of last
year's Varsity. Stronger batting
and speedy, accurate base running
will be tried for. The new system
will be a practical application of
the growing idea in baseball circles
that the so-called "hit and run"
game is the winning game. The
men will be limbered up with light
fielding work until they get in con
dition for hard practice. Then the
work will center around the batter's
box aad the base lines.
