# DISCUSSES CO-EDUCATION.
## Prof. Mary Roberts Smith Talks on Problems Facing University Women of Today. 
### 
Prof. Mary Roberts Smith,speak
ing under the auspices of the
Women's League, addressed the
women of the University on the
"Present Reaction Against Co
education" in the chapel at 1:30
this afternoon as follows:
The first great institution to offer
women higher education on an
equal footing with men was Cornell
University. The movement is rep
resentative of the democratic spirit
of fair play, which rules highest in
the regions populated by the un
prejudiced and unconventional pio
neer middle class.
At the time when Cornell took
the first step along true co-educa
tional lines, there were raging great
controversies over allied questions,
every one of which has been settled
favorably to women. There were
the questions of woman's mental
capacity, of the domesticity of the
graduate, and of woman's endur
ance under the strain of study. All
these are now no longer discussed.
Recently there has begun anew
an agitation. The very succcss of
co-education has brought up new
problems. There is expressed a
general fear lest women will pres
ently outnumber men in the great
institutions admitting them. The
women monopolize time and atten
tion to the detriment of the men.
Two remedies are available: one, to
limit the number of women; the
other to more fully develop the
courses especially suited to men —
such as those of engineering and
science.
The more serious objection is the
effect of co-education on the women
themselves. The fundamental ques
tion is in the relations of men and
women. Boarding-schools and
women's colleges develop women
more nicely trained in social mat
ters. They have few temptations.
The severest charge against co
education is the lack of manners
in women co educated.
Women should remedy whatever
may be justly criticised In so do
ing they must rely largely upon
the example of faculty wives, who
partly set the standard. But even
more they must rely upon tliem
selves.
Little indiscretions such as pass
observation at home are out of
place on the campus. Eccentric
ity and conspicuousness in dress
are to be avoided. Girls should
conform more closely to the world's
standard of conventionality.
They should watch in little
things. Resistance is not worth
while. There are but two classes of
gir 18 who disregard them —the girl
who does not care, and the inexper
ienced girl who does not know. But
the little things are the very things
that tell most against co-education.
The great objections have long ago
been overcome. It remains now
for particular persons in particular
details to remove whatever stigtna
may remain.
