The Library in its endeavor to
make a complete collection of
University publications is doing a
work that is worthy of support.
At present there are on the shelves
scarcely more than half the books
and articles written or published
by Stanford men and women, mem
bers of the faculty, old students,
and undergraduates. That a seri
ous attempt at getting these writ
ings into a specially organized de
partment was not made earlier in
the University's existence is un
fortunate. Considerable attention
should be paid to the request made
by Librarian Dodge in our an
nouncement column. Hereafter
copies of publications should be
sent to the Library as soon as they
come off the press.
