# TRACK PROSPECTS.
## Outlook for Present Semester Exceedingly Bright.â€”Work Commences Monday. 
### 
The track squad, which will in
all probability number over a
hundred men, will commence seri
ous training next Monday. All
last year's team are back with the
exception of Burton, the two-miler,
Taylor, the hurdler, Chadbourne,
in the distances, Watson of the re
lay team, and Luce, in the sprints.
However, there are several new men
who seem likely to strengthen the
team a great deal. Weller, from
the Ukiah high school, who holds
the academic records in the high
and low hurdles of 1G 2-5 and 26 2-5
seconds respectively, and is a good
all-round athlete beside; West from
the Seattle high school, in the
sprints and broad jump; and L. A.
Henley, who has done 2:09 in the
half-mile, have just entered. P. C.
Harper, '04, who made a good
showing in the two-mile in the
handicap meet last fall, will be a
valuable distance man. All indi
cations point to the strongest team
Stanford has ever had. In the
team there is not a single star; it
is made up of good, consistent per
formers.
The squad enters upon its open
ing work in excellent condition.
Fall training has succeeded beyond
expectations. With the hearty
cooperation of the gymnasium a
large number of men have been out
all fall working hard and conscien
tiously under the personal super
vision of Captain McCaughern,
Trainer Moulton,and several of the
older men. An interest in track
work has been awakened such as
has never before been felt. Though
no effort was made to get records
out of the men last fall, yet several
good ones were made. Firebaugh,
'04, ran the half-mile in 2:09 4-5;
Turpin, '06, did a hundred yards
in about 10 1-5; and Crawford,
'05, made a throw of 133 feet with
the hammer.
Even though there should be
considerable rain, the squad's
chances will not be materially in
jured by the consequent enforced
idleness.
Captain McCaughern expects to
arrange for several meets this
spring. The men will be given an
opportunity to show what they can
do in competition with outsiders
and may pick up some of the finer
points, lacking which fast men are
often beaten.
It is an interesting fact that six
pairs of brothers are on the squad;
there are two Henleys,two Beaches,
two Doles, two Hamiltons, two
Hydes, and two Thomsons.
There will be a meeting of the
candidates for the track team next
Wednesday night on the quad.
Captain McCaughern will announce
the time and place later. Several
men of prominence in athletics will
address the men.
