Today the track men begin strict
training. So much has been said
regarding the keeping of training
regulations that more is hardly
necessary. The success of
last year's team and the confidence
which it had it the captain and
trainer is evidence enough of its
effectiveness. The remarks made
by Captain McCaughern at the
laying of the cornerstone of the
gymnasium are indicative of his
attitude, and of the attitude which
gradually the student body is tak
ing. "He who breaks training and
thereby endangers the success of
his team is a traitor both to his
University and to his teammates.
I hope to see the time at Stanford
when a man so doing dare not
look his fellow students in the
face." That an athlete, preparing
for a meet, who smokes a cigarette,
can still retain the respect of the
student body is now as much to be
deplored as was the fact a year ago
that the athlete could have kept
his position on the team. To
make the 1903 track team will
mean something. It will mean
that each man on it is a member
of a team on which there are none
who have not earned their position.
It will be an honor worth striving
for. McCaughern is not a man to
pass out favors, least of all to those
who do not deserve them. There
will be no dilly-dallying concern
ing tiaining.
