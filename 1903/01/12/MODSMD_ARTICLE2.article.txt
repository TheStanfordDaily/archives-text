# Track Work Begins.
## 
### 
Sixty-five men have already sig
nified their intention of training 011
the track. There is room for many
more and Captain McCaughern ex
pects his squad to number more
than a hundred before the season
is far advanced. The fact that last
year two men who had never before
trained took places in the inter
collegiate meet, and that the team
will be one of steady performers
and not stars, will bring out many
new men.
H. A. Sprague, '04, who put up
such a great race in the Inter
collegiate two years ago, has re
turned and will make a valuable
acquisition to the distance squad.
Last season, during fall training,
when he was showing up remark
ably well, he was taken down with
appendicitis and compelled to
forego all training for the rest of
the year. Sprague ought to do
great things in the two-mile.
Steady work is going on both
morning and evening under "Dad"
Moulton's personal direction.
There is a remarkable business-like
air about every man's work that
promises good results. Training
rules went into force today.
