Itev. 1). Charles Gardner preached
the first sermon of the new year
Sunday morning in the chapel,
taking as his subject "Speak ye
every man truth to his neighbor."

"Our daily speech," said Mr.
Gardner, "is the most manifest
outward symbol of that inner be
ing which thinks and wills, and we
should guard the portals of our
speech as we would our own soul's
integrity. All our speaking should
be in truthfulness, kindness and
justice. We have one code for
private life and quite another in
political matters; one for personal
communication between friends and
another for general social inter
course. But the demands of the
Bible are nothing short of the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth.
"Then, too, the truth should be
spoken in kindness. How much of
the evil that is now spoken between
neighbors would be obviated
and how much happiness
would ensue if the rule of
kindness were always followed.
Justice, too, demands in our speak
ing entire truthfulness, faithfulness,
not to turn from evil when duty
calls on us to face and answer it."
