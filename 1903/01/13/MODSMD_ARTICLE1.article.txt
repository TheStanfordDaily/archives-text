# MUSICAL CLUBS RETURN.
## Successful Trip to Northern Cities Glee and Mandolin Men Everywhere Well Received. 
### 
The twenty-six members of the
Glee and Mandolin Clubs arrived
on the campus this morning. They
reached San Francisco at ten
o'clock last night after a four days'
voyage from Seattle on the steamer
Senator. The last concert of the
journey was given in Seattle, where
one of the largest audiences of the
entire trip heard the program. The
University of Washington was in
charge of the arrangements and
tendered a dance after the concert.
All the members of the clubs are
pleased with the treatment received
in the North. At nearly every
stoj) receptions, dinners, and dances
were given'in their honor. Finan
cially the results are gratifying,
notwithstanding the fact that a
deficit of nearly si'x hundred dol
lars faces the musicians. This,
however, can be amply made up at
the concert to be given in Assembly
Hall, January 23, and subsequent
ones at the Vendome in San Jose,
with the further possibility of a
date at the Del Monte Hotel. The
student body will not suffer, as the
sum is almost covered by the de
posit of the members. Before Vic
toria and Vancouver were reached
(he clubs were ahead financially,
but at these two British Columbia
cities meagre crowds attended. The
few who were present were espec
ially enthusiastic in their applause.
From Sacramento to Seattle the
journey was marked by a contin
uous round of entertainments. At
Redding, H. 15. Bush, '05, gave a
dance in the afternoon and a recep
tion at night. The alumni in
Portland joined in providing
amusements for (he men. To A.
W. Newill, principal of the Bishop
Scott Academy, who gratuitously
boarded the entire clubs for three
days, and to R. S. Fisher, ex-'O2,
who looked after the men while in
the city, a great deal of credit is
due. Mr. and Mrs. Newill gave a
reception for which seven hundred
invitations were sent out. Sunday
evening, December 28, Mr. and
Mrs. A. 10. Hockey tendered a re
ception. At Salem, Oregon, the
musicians were the guests of the
Illihee Clubs. The prison and the
insane asylum were visited. At
the latter institution several selec
tions were sung by the Glee Club.
After the concert the clubs were es
corted to Strong's restaurant where
the members were entertained and
banquetted. Hon. H. Heni
korn, Member of Parliament,
dined tlx; clubs at Victoria,
and at Vancouver Mrs. Keith
gave them a dinner and dance.
H. Beacham, Yale '95, tendered a
reception after the concert.
The only change in the program
was made necessary by the closing
of the opera house at Everett,
Wasl) Snohomish was substituted
and a good audience met the musi
cians. Carl L. Clemens, '93, head
football coach last fall, entertained.
The soloist, C. L. Firebaugh, '04,
the specialists—L. 1). Byrne, '05,
Bush, '05, and Baker, '04 —were
heartily encored at every concert.
Alumni in the northern cities con

aider the clubs of 1902-1903 the
best that have ever represented
Stanford. Without exception the
newspapers gave highly favorable
accounts of the concerts. "Stan
ford Red" and "One, Two, Three,
Four" from the Glee Club, and the
selection from "Carmen" from the
Mandolin Club, brought the most
applause.
