# BASEBALL PRACTICE.
## Light Work on the Diamond.â€”Squad Handicapped by Lack of Equipment. 
### 
Work on the diamond yesterday
wus of rather an informal nature.
Although all the men who appeared
wasted no time but got into the
game with a will, the fact that
proper equipment is still lacking
and the quota of men has not been
completed negatived the value of
the practice. The diamond needs
attention; new balls, shoes, ard
gloves are wanted; clothee need re
pairing. As soon as these matters
are attended to the whole squad
will report for regular practice.
\esterday there were a large
number of men at work, among
whom were Copp, McGilvray, Cow
den, Brown, Parker, Crawford,
Lowenthal,and Knight of last year's
Varsity. Captain Brown took
active charge, while Coach Swin
dells superintended operations from
the side-lines in order to be able to
watch the work of the new men.
The men in the outfield spent the
afternoon in chasing flies. There
was some sharp work on the dia
mond in throwing to bases and
fielding ground hits. The men are,
as a whole, in very good condition.
Up uo date ten men have sub
stituted baseball for regular gym
nasium.
