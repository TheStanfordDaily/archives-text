# Progress on Chemistry Building.

The equipment of the laboratory
for elementary chemistry in the
new Chemistry building is now
practically Complete. The one thing
which still stands in the way of
laboratory work for the elementary
class is the lack of continuous elec
tric current with which to run the
motor which furnishes the gas
supply. The classes in assaying
and elementary chemistry, which
will be the first to occupy the new
quarters, will probably move in by
the first of February. The whole
department may be moved by the
middle of that month. The lecture
work for the elementary class
began yesterdny according to
schedule.
Workmen are at present install
ing the converter for the direct cur
rent which will be used for motor
power and electro-chemical work
in the new Chemical laboratory.
Work is about to begin on putting
in the electric light fixtures.
