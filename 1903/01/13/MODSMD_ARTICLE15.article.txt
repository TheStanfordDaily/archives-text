Last semester the Seniors voted
that none should have a voice in
the selection of their class officers
who had not paid the assessment.
Next week only those who have
done their duty by the 1904 Quad
can cast a vote in the Junior elec
tion. Apropos of these actions, the
suggestion that the student body
recognize its efficiency by taking a
similar step may not be unpro
ductive of results. Only those who
are most interested in student af
fairs can best be trusted with the
selection of its executive and ad
ministrative officials. The time at
Stanford when elections may be
carried redhanded by the wholesale
voting of men and women who are
willing to allow the position of the
cross-marks on their ballots to be
dictated by zealous politicians, is
not a condition of past history and
will not be until some system other
than that now existing is put into
effect. The question is one that
has been subject for editorial dis
cussion for several years but has
never received the backing from
the members of the student body
that it deserves.
