# MEETING OF TRACK MEN.
## Candidates for Team Will be Given Advice Concerning Training Tomorrow Night. 
### 
Tomorrow evening at 7:30 the
candidates for the track team will
meet in room G2 quad. It is Cap
tain McCaughern's wish that every
man who intends to try for the
track team be present. Dr. Angell,
Dr. Snow, "Dad" Moulton and Cap
tain McCaughern will address the
men. The policy for the coming
season and the work expected of the
candidates will be discussed. Tech
nical questions incident to the sea
son's training will be explained.
There was light training last
night. The new men are getting
over the soreness and stiffness of
the first few days of training. The
track is in better condition than at
this time last year. It has been
recindered, and though part of it is
still rather soft, yet should there be
showers the men will be able to use
it within a few hours after the rain.
Ditches have been dug to drain the
runways for the pole-vault, high
jump, and broad jump. These
paths are the hardest to keep firm
and serviceable during rainy
weather. A locker has been built
on the oval in which poles, ham
mers, shots and other paraphernalia
of training may be kept.
Fifty men have substituted track
athletics for gymnasium work.
There are several men who are tak
ing track and gymnasium at the
same time. Among the fifty who
are substituting are manv of the
best gymnasts in the gymnasium.
