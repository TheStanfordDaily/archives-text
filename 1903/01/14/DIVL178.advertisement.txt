The Department of Music of the Thoburn School.
We call the attention of students who desire
to continue their study of music while at the
University to the excellent department of
music of the Thoburn School at Palo Alto.
This new department of the promising young
institution is directed by Mr. Arthur Jhoken
scher, who teaches piano and harmony, the in
struction in vocal music being in the hands of
Mrs. Fickenseher. Mr. Fickenscher does not
need an introduction to the faculty and students
of Stanford. He is recognized as one of the
foremost pianists and teachers of musie on the
Pacific Coast. Asa oomposer, he ranks among
the first in this country. In her recent visit to
San Francisco. Frau Schumann Ileinck, the
famous contralto, asked it as a special favor
that Mr. Fickonscher dedicate several of his
songs to her.
To be instructed by an artist like Mr. Ficken
scher is a privi ege of which many will gladly
avail themselves.
Qflfin PAV PLENTY of positions for best
UUUU IHI teachers in country, city, high
and private schools. 1350 positions already
111 led in California alone. We want the BEST
TEACHER from whatever school or university.

DEGREE. Particulars to teachers and school
trustees free. FISK TEACHERS' AGENCY.
