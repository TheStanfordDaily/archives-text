# SEATING AT DEDICATION.
## Sections to be Reserved for Students, Faculty, Alumni, Trustees, Guests, and Workmen. 
### 
Arrangements for sealing those
who will attend the dedication of
Memorial Church on January 25th
are nearly completed. The fact
that the Church ordinarily has seats
for only seventeen hundred people
and that there are fully eighteen
hundred who have every right to
expect accommodations, lias caused
considerable difficulty. However,
Dr. Newton and Chaplain Gardner
who have charge of the matter,have
decided to have all available space
in the Church filled with chairs.
Mrs. Stanford having requested
that the formality of giving out
tickets be dispensed with, the only
reservations will be in bulk. Sec
tions will be set apart for the
students of the University, the
alumni, the members of the faculty
and their wives, the trustees and
their wives, the guests of Dr. Jor
dan, and the workmen. These will
meet at different points of the quad
and march to the Church, the doors
opening for them at 10:50. A part
of the Church will be reserved for
visitors, who will be admitted at
10:55. At eleven o'clock the doors
will be closed. Reservations hold
for the morning only. The after
noon session will begin at 3:30.
For this no seats will be reserved.
The program for the ceremonies
has not yet been completed. It
will be announced within a few
clays. The principal feature, how
ever, will be the address of Dr.
Newton in the morning.
