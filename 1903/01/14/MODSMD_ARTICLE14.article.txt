The alumni of Oregon and
Washington have of late years re
peatedly deplored what they term
noticeable coldness in the attitude
of northern citizens toward Stan
ford. Tliia decline in enthusiasm
they attribute to the impression
left by athletes and visiting organi
zations of various sorts represent
ing themselves not only as travel
ing under a Stanford sanction, but
also as the best Stanford could send
out. That the behavior and atti
tude of the musical clubs on their
vacation trip this year has been
everything that could be asked is
evidenced by the temper of news
paper articles and by the whole
souled indorsement of old Stanford
men in the towns visited. Nothing
but commendation for the quality
of the concert and the behavior of
the men has been heard. The
musicians have made hosts of
friends for Stanford and deserve
the hearty congratulations of the
faculty and student body.
