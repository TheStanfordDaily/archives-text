A few words to those who this
year do not expect to play on the
Varsity baseball team may well he
said. Many times in her athletic
history Stanford has been handi
capped through the holding back of

fact that last year's Varsity has
returned almost, intact is something
over which all rejoice, but this
should deter no one who has ever
plaved htiseball from appearing at
the first practice tomorrow prepared
to do his best throughout the sea
son. It must be remembered that
eight of the ten Varsity baseball
men now in college will not be here
next year. We should have a
strong, aggressive second team
from which to build next year's
Varsity.
