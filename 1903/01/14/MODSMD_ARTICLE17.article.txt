# New Year's "Chappie."
## 
### 
The feature of the New Year's
Chaparral, which will be on sale
tomorrow, is to be a page from the
Alviso Fog Horn, a periodical sup
posed to be published jointly by
the residents of Alviso-on-Slough
and Milpitas-on-Bay. The editor
is Benjamin Hide Wheeler, who has
been imported by the Alviso resi
dents to toot their Fog Horn.
The issue will introduce a new
Stanford artist, 0. K. Smith, '06,
who designed the cover drawing.
A full-page design by Miss Well
man, and a contribution from Ben
Hur, the blanket-man, are among
the art features.
In verse Mrs. Trusdale immortal
izes the course in Psychology of the
Commotions. Renaud contributes
an excellent college lyric.
Editorially "Chappie" says some
good things concerning student
body assessments.
