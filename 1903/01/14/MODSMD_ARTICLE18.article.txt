# Berkeley Loses Abadie.
## 
### 
Among those recently dropped
from the University of California
for deficiency in scholarship was
Emil Abadie, the crack sprinter.
Abadie won the 100-yard dash in
the intercollegiate meet last year
and he probably would have won
another victory for the Blue and
Gold in the coming contest. The
dropping of Abadie from the uni
versity, following the departure of
several other men, including Cheek,
the hurdler, depended upon to win
points for them, is causing some
anxiety at Berkeley.
Orval Overall, the new football
captain and varsity baseball
pitcher, had a narrow escape. He
failed in his final examinations,but
but was allowed to take a re-exam
ination in which he made the
number of units necessary for
registration.
