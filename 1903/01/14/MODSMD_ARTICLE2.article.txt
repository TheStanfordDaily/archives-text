# Foundry Improvements.
## 
### 
Classes have begun work in the
Foundry under the direction of the
new instructor, J. 13. Liggett. Sev
eral brass furnaces and the shaft to
run the blower for the cupola will
be in position in a few days. A
motor for the cupola has been put
in. My Friday everything will be
ready to put out molten metal;
the cupola will then be tried.
Within two weeks the Foundry
will be fully equipped and will be
able to make any kind of castings
under a ton's weight. Many stu
dents have registered for the
course.
