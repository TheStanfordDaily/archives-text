# FRESHMAN DEBATERS.
## Try-out Last Night Not Entirely Satisfactory to the Judges. 
### 
E. A. Cunha, J. L. Maloy, and
J. Nibley were last night chosen to
represent the Freshmen in the com
ing Freshman-Sophomore debate.
The try-out was held in the
chapel, J. H. Page, '03, president of
the Intersociety Debating League,
presiding. He announced the
judges, Professors Farrand and
Alden and Instructor Bassett, and
the terms of the debate. Each
speaker had ten minutes in which
to present his argument. The
leader for the affirmative had three
minutes for rebuttal.
The contestants spoke in the fol
lowing order: \V. G. Brown, F. J.
McElroy, J. Nibley, W. A. I'axton,
H. P. Bittner, E. A. Cunha, E. D.
Carothers, J.L. Maloy, P. B.Smith,
J. E. Campbell, D. I). Sales, It.
Howard, and C. B. Osbourne. The
judges decided on E. A. Cunha, J.
L. Maloy, and J. Nibley, with R.
Howard as alternate. Cunha won
on a thorough preparation and a
vigorous, earnest delivery; Maloy
on preparation and logical ar
rangement of facts; Nibley on his
quiet, effective delivery; and How
ard on preparation. D. D. Sales
and I'. B. Smith made strong
speeches. Sales had a very good
delivery, but wandered from the
subject. Smith's address was
among the best in point of facts
and arrangement.
Professor Farrand in announc
ing the judges' selection expressed
dissatisfaction with the try-out.
Lack of preparation was the chief
fault of the speakers.
Of the twenty men who had
signed up for the contest only
twelve appeared on the floor. The
questions were none of them
thoroughly discussed. Many of
the speakers were handicapped
on account of the fact that their
rebuttals were made ineffective by
the absence of their opponents.
