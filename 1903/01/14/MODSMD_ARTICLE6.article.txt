Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The committee lias given the
making of the 11)03 pins to Ham
mersmith & Field of Sun Fran
cisco. The Bookstore will handle
them. Seniors may at any time
leave their names there with a de
posit. However, since a special
die must he made, there will have
to be several orders in before Ham
mersmith & Field will feel war
ranted in going ahead. There has
been considerable demand for a
sample, but since there iH a large
expense invoived in making the
die, no sample can be had until
enough orders are received. The
pin is lo be as follows: Fourteen
karat gold, about the size of a ten
cent piece, of the best enamel, rep
resenting the seal of the Univer
sity which is the Palo Alto tree en
circled by " Leland Stanford Jun
ior University, organized 1891,"
the figure "'O3" to show through
the background of enamel in gold.
The price of the pin is $3.25.
It will greatly facilitate matters
if all those Seniors who desire pins
will leave their orders at the Book
store immediately. Committkk.
