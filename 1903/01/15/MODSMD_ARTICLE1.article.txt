# TALKS ON TRACK.
## Quiet, Earnest Discussion of the Training Policy for the Season. 
### 
The candidates for membership
in the 1903 track team last night
listened to several earnest talks.
The meeting was not a "jolly-up."
spoke first, as
follows; "We want more men out.
Use your influence on your friends.
Out of a hundred men there should
he developed at least thirty point
winners. You have a trainer who
is unequaled and one who will do
the right thing by every one of you.
We must work consistently. Every
man should be out every day. You
must all be patient. Every man
will receive the personal attention
due him, Dancing is bad for track
men. < It,may mean but little, but
that little may lose a place. After
February Ist three dances may be
attended and none after the be
ginning of the Easter vacation.
I will not endeavor to fix a set
hour for retiring. I leave it to each
one of you. All I ask is that you
be regular. We will not diet dur
ing the early part of the season, but
you should avoid greasy foods. We
shall try to have a training-table
during the last three weeks of
training. I want every one of you
to remain here during the spring
vacation. We shall have as many
meets as possible. I propose to
institute Sunday walks for the
whole team so that we may develop
a team spirit."
"Dad" Moulton then spoke: "We
want more distance men. You
must make every endeavor to get
out all Ihe men you can. The
training will do you good. It need
not detract from your University
work. '1 ask that you all be free to
come to me for any cause whatever
and I will be very glad to do what
1 can for you."
McCaughern then introduced Dr.
Angell,who was received with much
applause. He said: "This is the
first time If have spoken before an
assembly of University men in ten
years. Some time ago 1 noted with
sorrow that the old standard of
training was being broken. Mat
ters have.been going from bad to
worse. It has re'r ained for the
1902 tr&ck,, team, with Captain
McCaughern at its head, to revive
the old Stanford spirit. The work
is still being carried on by the cap
tain and trainer It rests with the
1903 track team to bring this spirit
to what it was six years ago. Win
or lose, I shall always look with
pride on the track teams of 1902
and 1903 for what they have done
and are doing for Stanford spirit."
Dr. Snow then spoke of the rela
tion of the Hygiene department to
athletics. "It is our earnest desire
that every in An receive the exercise
that is best for him. The depart
ment stands behind systematic
training and has every confidence
in the captain and trainer. They
will do all that is required of them.
Students are examined in order to
guard against accidents. The gym
nasium desires to keep in touch
with all athletics."
Treasurer Edwards said that the
management would do everything
in its power to aid the team.
