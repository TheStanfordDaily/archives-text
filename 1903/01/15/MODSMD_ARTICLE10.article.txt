It ought to be needless to call
especial attention to the fact that
tomorrow night will be chosen the
debating team which will represent
Stanford in the annual Carnot de
bate with California. In the past
history of debating at Stanford so
little interest has been shown by
the members of the student body
that the most important debating
events have taken place before
audiences ranging in number from

ten to thirty people. This is hardly
fair to the debaters and shows an
undue lack of consideration on the
part of the thirteen hundred under
graduates. The debaters who will
speak tomorrow night have putin
several weeks of hard work in pre
paration. If the chapel is packed,
more than anything else it will
urge the speakers to put forth their
best efforts and will show them
that their efforts have not gone un
appreciated.
