# The
						"Chaparral."

### 
When the quality of all that
should make up a good Chaparral
is considered, the verdict must be
that in general excellence the num
ber which came out today is the
equal of any that has yet been is
sued. It is in the joshes that most
improvement is seen. They are
good, and numerous, with an oc
casional bit of philosophy. In
verse there are contributions by
R. E. Renaud,'o3, C. S. Thompson,
'04, Mrs. Trusdale, and Miss 1. A.
Wright, '04, all worthy of mention.
Miss Wellman's full-page drawing,
"Hail, ye bright New Year," is the
most striking artistic feature.
