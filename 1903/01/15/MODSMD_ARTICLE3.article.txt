# DR. NEWSOM RETURNED.
## Ends Successful Tour of European and American Mining Schools and Mineral Deposits. 
### 
Dr. Newsom, associate professor
of Mining and Metallurgy, returned
to the University the first of the
week, after completing a four
months' trip of study and investi
gation on the other side of the At
lantic. All the principal mining
schools of England, Wales and the
Continent were visited and studied
by Dr. Newsom. His first work of
investigation was carried on in
England, where the Royal School
of Mines in London is located. In
Cornwall and South Wales the
Camborne School of Mines and the
tin region, in which it is located,
and the Swansea copper smelting
and anthracite coal regions were
inspected.
Oil the Continent Dr. Newsom
stopped at the Brussels School of
Mines in Belgium, afterwards mak
ing a careful study of German
schools and methods. The coal
regions near Dresden, the lead and
copper mines of Harz mountains,
the copper deposits at Goslar, the
mining academies at Berlin and
Freiburg, Saxony, occupied a large
part of his time. He visited the
school at Pribram, Bohemia; the
Leoben Academy at Styrie in
Southern Austria; in Paris the
School of Mines. In the East Dr.
Newsom was at the Columbia
School of Mines, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Mining
School of McGill University, and
the Harvard Mining School.
Dr. Newsom regards the equip
ment, condition, laboratories and
methods of the American schools
as superior and more progressive
than those of their European rivals.
