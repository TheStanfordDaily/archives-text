# PRAISE FOR MUSICIANS.
## What Tacoma and Portland Thought of Glee and Mandolin Clubs' Concert. 
### 
The Tacoma Daily Ledger, in
speaking of tlie concert given at
Tacoma by the Stanford Glee and
Mandolin Clubs, has the following:
"Everyone in the brilliant audi
ence that greeted the Stanford boys
last night at the Tacoma Theatre
was apparently in the heartiest
sympathy with the spirit that gives
to the music of college glee clubs
its irresistible charm. College men
of all ages sat convulsed with
mirth, tilled with memories, and
proudly recalled the days when
they joined in similar endeavors;
and the boys and the girls gave
way to the hilarity of the occasion
and vociferously applauded the
clever work of their contemporaries.
"There has not been a more en
joyable concert presented by the
young men of Stanford on any of
their tours, and it is a pleasure to
note that they were given a recep
tion both cordial and substantial.
"The honors, as between tlie two
clubs, belong rather to the Mando
lin Club, which did the finest work
of the kind ever heard in Tacoma.
In the Bj)lendid volume of tone, the
absolute unity of action, the superb
crescendoes, general style, and fin
ish the numbers played by the cap
tivating strings were notable. The
club is especially fortunate in its
leader, R. J. Keith.
"The Glee Club is in good form,
especially in the bass, and sang
with plenty of spirit and excellent
attention to shading and expres
sion.
"Mr. Byrne, the raconteur, with
his smile that defies description, his
clever mimicry and dramatic
power, won the instant friendship
of the house, and performed a long
list of selections inimitably. Ev
erybody went down before Bush
and Baker, the two funny men,
who have an infinite variety of
'stunts' at their command."
The Portland Oregonian writes
up the concert at Salem as follows:
"The Stanford Glee and Mando
lin Clubs were greeted by a large
audience at the Salem Opera House
tonight. The concert by the colle
gians was the best of the kind ever
presented in the Capital City, and
the entertainment proved a delight
ful Christmas treat. Both Glee
and Mandolin Clubs are stronger
than ever before. The collegians
are fortunate in having with them
Byrne, who is one of the cleverest
amateur elocutionists ever seen
here. He was easily the favorite
of the audience, and was encored
repeatedly. Bush and Baker, com
edians, are superior to many pro
fessionals, and shared the honors
with Byrne. C. L. Firebaugh, the
bass soloist, scored a hit. Three
and four encores for every number
extended the original program of
twelve pieces to over thirty num
bers."
