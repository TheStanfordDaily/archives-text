There was a tone at last night's
meeting of track men such as has
not been shown in a meeting of
Stanford athletes for several years.
The fact that any man breaking
training rules could not remain on
the team seemed taken as a matter
of course. "Every man there knew
that the trainer and captain meant
business. This is an attitude for
lack of which Stanford has suffered
an immense amount within the last
six years. The words of congratu
lation bestowed by Dr. Angell on
Trainer Moulton and Captain
McCaughern were richly deserved.
Others who with Dr. Angell were
in a position a year ago to realize
how hard a fight was before these
two men, cannot but appreciate
their efforts and thank them for
having brought to the athletes a
return of the old spirit of self
denial that has in the past won
battles for the Cardinal. It re
mains now for the student body to
help the men keep the rules which
have been set down for them. Many
a man has stapped over the regula
tion boundaries because urged to
do so by unthinking associates.
While the student body should
unite in tendering to the traitor,
who pretends to bo doing his best
for Stanford and is not, the igno
miny he deserves, still more so
should it in.itu in tendering to the
man who consistently trains its
heartiest approbation.
