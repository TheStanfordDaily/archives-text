## 
### 
The Y. W. C. A. cleared $350
above all expenses on their Jordan
Calendar. Most of the calendars
were sold on the campus and in
Palo Alto. Some were sold in San
Francisco and some in San Jose.
The edition—3oo colored and 500
plain—was entirely disposed of
and more could have been sold.
The supply was exhausted several
days before Christmas. The money
has almost all been used in paying
the salaries and expenses of the
Association. The expenses for the
year will amount to about $680.
