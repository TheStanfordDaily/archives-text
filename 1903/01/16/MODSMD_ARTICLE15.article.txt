The rehearsals of the Festival
Choir have been attended by but a
small percentage of the singers of
the University, and this irregularly.
Next week special rehearsals of the
dedication music will be arranged
for. Unless every singer is at
every rehearsal the high standard
for which Organist Scott Brook for
several months past has been work
ing, may not be reached.
