The Chaparral joins us in the
cry against the controlling of
student body elections by those who
do not care enough about under
graduate affairs to help in their
support. Says "Chappie":
"In the coming election there
will be exceptional opportunities
for freshmen, perpetual and other
wise, to commit depredations upon
the true patriots of Stanford, unless
steps are taken to eliminate the
ignorant vote. 'Chappie' offers
free of cost the advice that a con
stitutional amendment be passed,
prohibiting all those who have not
paid their student body assess
ments from participating in the
joys and sorrows of election day.
The move will fill a long-felt want
and render useless an unlimited
amount of wire which will soon be
laid against the coming day of
festivities."
The measure will be supported
by every thinking man und woman
in the University. We look for
ward to the time when an amend
ment will be submitted to the
student body for its approval or
rejection. We have faith enough
in the Stanford undergraduate to
predict its adoption.
