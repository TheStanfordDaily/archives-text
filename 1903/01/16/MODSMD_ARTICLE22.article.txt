The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs have no fault to find with
the reception accorded them by the
people of Salem.
In the evening there was a large
and select audience to greet them
at the Grand Opera House, when
the curtain arose at the beginning
of an excellent musical and farcial
entertainment in which the Varsity
boys did themselves proud; and
their efforts were accorded due ap
preciation by the delighted and en
thusiastic audience.
The star comedians, Baker and
Hush, G. L. Firebaugh, the basso
profundo, and the Glee Club's male
quartette, were the features of the
performance; while the Mandolin
Club, an excellent musical segre
gation, fairly charmed the vast
audience with the most inspiring
selections of their repertoire.
The entire aggregation displays
marked improvement since their
last appearance in this city, and
their visits in the future will be
looked forward to with pleasant
anticipations by the music and fun
lovers of Salem. —Statesman, Salem,
Oregon.
The program given by the Stan
ford Univereity Glee and Mando
lin Clubs at the opera house last
night was of a variety and merit
that thoroughly pleased the large
audience that listened to them.
The Glee Club consists of fourteen
well-trained voices, vocalists,among
whom is Mr. Firebaugh, whose solo
in the first part disclosed a baritone
voice of rare quality. The Mando
lin Club possess also fourteen in
struments, and the selections of the
club were enthusiastically encored.
Among the members of the club is
an accomplished elocutionist, Mr.
Byrne, whose renditions lent a de
lightful diversity to the program.
Bush and Baker in burlesque grand
opera and other comedy present an
act that has the charm of decided
novelty and the vim and finish of
professionalism. Last night the
audience could not get enough of
them.—Morning Olympian.
