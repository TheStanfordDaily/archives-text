# FIRST BASEBALL PRACTICE.
## Season Begins With Large Number of Freshman and Old Men. 
### 
The first baseball practice of the
season was very encouraging to
both coach and captain. The
number of men who showed up
was gratifyingly large, and the
promise that some of the new men
gave of rounding into Varsity form
was far greater than was to have
been expected. Irregular practice
has been carried on during the past
week in a rather desultory manner,
but with the first regular work a
new spirit seems to have been in
fused into the candidates. There
were over forty men on the field in
uniform, half of whom were fresh
men. A partial list of the candi
dates was secured, but the number
of players who appeared last night
by no means represents the base
ball material in college. The
following freshmen were at work
last night: F. H.Trowbridge, D. D.
Sales, J. H. Colbert, R. A. Williams,
W. Wirt, H. W. Campbell, W. C.
Burr, E. E. Jordan, B. Mathews,
L. R. Weinmann, C.A.Ferguson, R.
A. Hudson, G. L. Scovilie, B. L.
Trost.
Of these men several handle
themselves very well; the prospects
for astrong Freshman nine are ac
cordingly good. Sales, Williams,
Wirt and Weinmann give promise of
developing into first-class men, al
though it is too early to get a line
on the real ability of the new can
didates.
There is every indication that the
first team will be given hard rubs
in the deily practice, as the second
team when lined up will be hard
to beat.
Of the old men who are back
W. E. Tritch, '04, A. L. Trowbridge,
'05, W. K. Roosevelt, '03, L. G.
Moore, '03, C. K. Studley, '03, C. B.
Hopper, '05, H. C. Scales, '04, J. L.
Gamble, '05, E. Stillman, '05, and
D. V. Moore, '05, are all able to do
work bordering on Varsity form.
Kellogg and McFarland are the
only men of last year's nine who
did not return to college. There
are now ten Varsity baseball men
in college, all of whom will appear
for work this season: D. V. Cow
den, '02, captain of last year's
Varsitv, G. H. Crawford, '03, R. B.
Knight, '03, R. B. Ball, "03, F. A.
Brown, '03, captain, W. W. Copp,
'03, W. H. Blake, '04, A. B. C. Mc-
Gilvray, '04, W. B. Lowenthal, '03,
and P. P. Parker, '03. All will be
on the diamond for daily practice.
Bruce Ball, '03, will not be able to
play in Saturday games on account
of conflicting University work.
Last night the men did not line
u]), bill the fielders were kept busy
doing outfield work, while two sets
of intielders were being tried on fast
ground balls. The first set tried
out was: Cowden at first, Brown at
second, Copp at third, Crawford at
short, and McGilvray behind the
bat. These men were put through
a hard spurt and then gave place
to Blake at first, Williams at sec
ond, Roosevelt and L. G. Moore at
third, A. L. Trowbridge at short,
and Stillman in the catcher's box.
Although the lack of practice was
evidenced by occasional wildness in

throwing to bases, there was no
hesitation in going after the ball.
Both Captain Brown and Coach
Swindells are optimistic over the
outlook for the season. There is
an infield of seasoned players who
know the game, a strong
set of outfielders, two men
who have caught for Stanford
Varsities, and seven candidates for
the pitcher's position—Parker,
Sales, Tritch, Williams, Studley,
Colbert, and Roosevelt. Swindells
will give the men the rest of this
week in which to limber up. After
that every night the first and sec
ond teams will go up against each
other.

Kellogg and McFarland are the
only men of last year's nine who
did not return to college. There
are now ten Varsity baseball men
in college, all of whom will appear
for work this season: D. V. Cow
den, '02, captain of last year's
Varsitv, G. H. Crawford, '03, R. B.
Knight, '03, R. B. Ball, "03, F. A.
Brown, '03, captain, W. W. Copp,
'03, W. H. Blake, '04, A. B. C. Mc-
Gilvray, '04, W. B. Lowenthal, '03,
and P. P. Parker, '03. All will be
on the diamond for daily practice.
Bruce Ball, '03, will not be able to
play in Saturday games on account
of conflicting University work.
Last night the men did not line
u]), bill the fielders were kept busy
doing outfield work, while two sets
of intielders were being tried on fast
ground balls. The first set tried
out was: Cowden at first, Brown at
second, Copp at third, Crawford at
short, and McGilvray behind the
bat. These men were put through
a hard spurt and then gave place
to Blake at first, Williams at sec
ond, Roosevelt and L. G. Moore at
third, A. L. Trowbridge at short,
and Stillman in the catcher's box.
Although the lack of practice was
evidenced by occasional wildness in

throwing to bases, there was no
hesitation in going after the ball.
Both Captain Brown and Coach
Swindells are optimistic over the
outlook for the season. There is
an infield of seasoned players who
know the game, a strong
set of outfielders, two men
who have caught for Stanford
Varsities, and seven candidates for
the pitcher's position—Parker,
Sales, Tritch, Williams, Studley,
Colbert, and Roosevelt. Swindells
will give the men the rest of this
week in which to limber up. After
that every night the first and sec
ond teams will go up against each
other.
