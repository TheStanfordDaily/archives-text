# LEWIS, ROEHR, AND RITTER.
## The 						Three Men Who Will Represent Stanford in the Carnot.—Spencer is Alternate. 
### 
The final try-out of candidates
for the Carnot debating team was
held in the chapel Friday night,
and resulted in the selection of
H. M. Lewis, '04, Frank Koehr, '04,
and O. H. Hitter, '04, to represent
Stanford in the contest with the
University of California four weeks
hence. O. C. Spencer was named
as alternate. All four men are ex
perienced debaters, and have repre
sented their classes in various con
tests. Hitter besides was a mem
ber of the Varsity team that met
the University of Washington last
year. Lewis, Ritter, and Spencer
are members of the Euphronia De
bating Society, and Koehr belongs
to the San Jose Debating Society.
All four are members of the Class
of '04. The judges were Professors
Duniway, Newcomer, and Alden.
H. C. Jones presided, and E. \V.
Rice acted as timer. Both have
been Carnot debaters.
The question under considera
tion was: "Resolved, That the
French policy of guaranteeing div
idends on railway investments has
been for the public interest." It
was understood that the question
would be connected with the French
railways, but, in conformity with
the new agreement, its exiict nature
was not announced until one hour
before the debate. Thus the inten
tion of the founder, Baron Pierre
de Coubertin, that the debate
should be to develop extemporane
ous speaking, has been returned to.
There were nine speakers in the
try-out Friday night: four for the
affirmative and five for the nega
tive. Sides were chosen by lot, and
each speaker was allowed twelve
minutes. Of the successful candi
dates, Roehr spoke for the affirma
tive, and Ritter, Lewis, and Spen
cer for the negative.
W. E. Hillings, '03, was the first
speaker. He had the affirmative
to uphold. The guaranteeing of
dividends, said he, was the funda
mental principle of the present
French railway system. When the
question of railways first arose,
public ownership was agitated, but
the great lesson taught by the
French Revolution was remembered,
and the policy of government aid
was decided upon as a compromise.
The government was unable to un
dertake the construction of railways
alone, and timid private capital
would not. A government guaran
tee therefore became a necessity.
It was believed that this policy
would awaken popular interest,and
that the working people would in
vest their small savings. It was
contended by Mr. Hillings that
these expectations had been fully
realized. "The present policy," he
said, "has upbuilt France It has
developed the industrial and com
mercial life of the nation. It has
prevented disastrous rate wars and
has maintained stable rntes. It is
not a severe strain on t!)«-'govern
ment and the people, for the guar
antees are to be refunded, as is be
ing done even now. Last year it
is calculated that the government
saved $24,000,000 in the transpor

tation of troops, supplies, mails,
etc., and the taxation on the rail
roads amounted to $17,000,000.
The present policy has strength
ened the government of France by
assimilating the interests of the
people and joining those interests
with the interests of the govern
ments."
A. M. Dibble, '05, opened for the
negative. The present system of
railway subsidies in France is dan
gerous. Kates have been higher in
France than in any other country
of Europe, and the government has
not been able to compel the lines to
lower them, for it might itself be
called topon to make up a deficit.
15y its policy of guaranteeing divi
dends, its hands have been effectu
ally tied. The railroads' monopoly

frees them of the danger of compe
tition, and their demands are con
stantly growing. The government
has been paying enormous sums to
them when the lines were actually
realizing handsome profits. The
guarantees are entirely too extrav
agant.
J. H. Page, '03, was the second
speaker for the affirmative. He
claimed that all the countries of
Europe and even the United States
had found it expedient to subsidize
various railroads, and he laid stress
on the fact that France, surrounded
by possibly hostile nations, must
have control of an elaborate system
of railroads to meet any military
exigency. The people, too, found
a safe way of investing their small
savings.
O. C. Spencer, '04, who was sub
sequently chosen as alternate, fol
lowed Page. He admitted subsi
dies had been granted in the United
States, but he said the payments
had ceased immediately the lines
were able to stand of their own ac
cord. In Germany the same sys
tem had been tried, but had failed,
and the government had taken over
control of the lines. The system of
guaranteeing dividends had de
stroyed the commercial spirit of the
people, who were ever becoming

! more and more dependent upon the
government.
M. S. Lewis, '04, and A. S. Wil
liams, '03, then spoke for the affirm
; ative and negative respectively.
Frank Roehr, '04, who followed,
/ was the only speaker on the affirm
i ative side to win a place on the
team. Roehr's statement of facts
was far better than his delivery,
but he did very well after he had
once warmed up. Replying to the
previous speakers for the negative,
lie said there had been no spirit of
commercialism in France to kill.
It was to raise such a spirit that
guarantees of dividends were given.
Without guarantees, he said, the
railroads could never have been
built. The guarantee was not a
gift; it was a loan to be repaid at

four per cent interest, and the rail
roads are even now hurrying to get
out of the government's debt, for
they could get capital elsewhere.
The railway system of France was
based upon a comprehensive plan.
For military reasons, lines had to
be built in sections whore they
could not be expected to be profit
able, and the government was com
pelled to guarantee dividends.
O. H. Ritter, '04, followed for the
negative. Ritter showed that he
well deserved a place on the team.
He has a very pleasing address,
and with his complete self-control
under the new conditions, he ought
to make a close fight for the Carnot
medal. The republican form of


Jw H.3itter
administration in France, Ritter
Baid, bound up the welfare of the
government in the welfare of the
peoplr If the guaranteeing of div
idends on railway investments was
detrimental to the people, it was
dangerous to the government. It
was necessary that the same idea
of independence that one finds in
England and America he developed
in France; and it had not been, be
cause the people expected the gov
ernment to take care of them under
any circumstances. The idea of
paternalism was the curse of the
nation. The companies make im
mense profits on their present in
vestment, and are satisfied to ig
nore questions of improvement.
H. M. Lewis, '04, was the closing
speaker for the negative. Lewis
had some very good points and
made them in an emphatic way,
although he spoke a little too rap
idly to get the best effect. The
policy of guaranteeing dividends,
he said, had been neither an eco
nomic nor a military advantage.
If the country had excellent canals
and roads, why should the govern
ment force upon the people a sys
tem of railroads? France had able
financiers, and if railroads were de
manded by the people, the demand
would meet with ready response
from private capital. The bonds
of these subsidized lines cannot be
secured by the common people.
They are held by the Rothschilds,
and sold away above par. The
guarantee system has resulted only
in poor service, gross mismanage
ment, and unjust charges. At
tempts to transport large bodies of
troops in recent years have failed
dismally. Directors who did little
are paid enormous salaries, and re
sponsibility is extremely lax. The
people are heartily sick of the ex
periment. Lewis then cited a
number of steps that have been
taken toward government owner
ship.
This ended the statements, and
Billings and Roehr then spoke in
rebuttal for the affirmative, and
Dibble for the negative. Each man
was allowed one minute.
The judges then retired, and
after fifteen minutes deliberation
announced their decision in favor
of H. M. Lewis, Roehr, and Ritter.
Professor Duniway said he and his
colleagues were well pleased with
the speeches.
There were about two hundred

people at the try-out, and the
speakers were heartily applauded.
From the standpoint of enthusiasm
and attendance it was probably the
most successful try-out ever held at
Stanford.
The final try-out of candidates
for the Carnot debating team was

cord. In Germany the same sys
tem had been tried, but had failed,
and the government had taken over
control of the lines. The system of
guaranteeing dividends had de
stroyed the commercial spirit of the
people, who were ever becoming

! more and more dependent upon the
government.
M. S. Lewis, '04, and A. S. Wil
liams, '03, then spoke for the affirm
; ative and negative respectively.
Frank Roehr, '04, who followed,
/ was the only speaker on the affirm
i ative side to win a place on the
team. Roehr's statement of facts
was far better than his delivery,
but he did very well after he had
once warmed up. Replying to the
previous speakers for the negative,
lie said there had been no spirit of
commercialism in France to kill.
It was to raise such a spirit that
guarantees of dividends were given.
Without guarantees, he said, the
railroads could never have been
built. The guarantee was not a
gift; it was a loan to be repaid at

four per cent interest, and the rail
roads are even now hurrying to get
out of the government's debt, for
they could get capital elsewhere.
The railway system of France was
based upon a comprehensive plan.
For military reasons, lines had to
be built in sections whore they
could not be expected to be profit
able, and the government was com
pelled to guarantee dividends.
O. H. Ritter, '04, followed for the
negative. Ritter showed that he
well deserved a place on the team.
He has a very pleasing address,
and with his complete self-control
under the new conditions, he ought
to make a close fight for the Carnot
medal. The republican form of


Jw H.3itter
administration in France, Ritter
Baid, bound up the welfare of the
government in the welfare of the
peoplr If the guaranteeing of div
idends on railway investments was
detrimental to the people, it was
dangerous to the government. It
was necessary that the same idea
of independence that one finds in
England and America he developed
in France; and it had not been, be
cause the people expected the gov
ernment to take care of them under
any circumstances. The idea of
paternalism was the curse of the
nation. The companies make im
mense profits on their present in
vestment, and are satisfied to ig
nore questions of improvement.
H. M. Lewis, '04, was the closing
speaker for the negative. Lewis
had some very good points and
made them in an emphatic way,
although he spoke a little too rap
idly to get the best effect. The
policy of guaranteeing dividends,
he said, had been neither an eco
nomic nor a military advantage.
If the country had excellent canals
and roads, why should the govern
ment force upon the people a sys
tem of railroads? France had able
financiers, and if railroads were de
manded by the people, the demand
would meet with ready response
from private capital. The bonds
of these subsidized lines cannot be
secured by the common people.
They are held by the Rothschilds,
and sold away above par. The
guarantee system has resulted only
in poor service, gross mismanage
ment, and unjust charges. At
tempts to transport large bodies of
troops in recent years have failed
dismally. Directors who did little
are paid enormous salaries, and re
sponsibility is extremely lax. The
people are heartily sick of the ex
periment. Lewis then cited a
number of steps that have been
taken toward government owner
ship.
This ended the statements, and
Billings and Roehr then spoke in
rebuttal for the affirmative, and
Dibble for the negative. Each man
was allowed one minute.
The judges then retired, and
after fifteen minutes deliberation
announced their decision in favor
of H. M. Lewis, Roehr, and Ritter.
Professor Duniway said he and his
colleagues were well pleased with
the speeches.
There were about two hundred

people at the try-out, and the
speakers were heartily applauded.
From the standpoint of enthusiasm
and attendance it was probably the
most successful try-out ever held at
Stanford.
The final try-out of candidates
for the Carnot debating team was
held in the chapel Friday night,
and resulted in the selection of
H. M. Lewis, '04, Frank Koehr, '04,
and O. H. Hitter, '04, to represent
Stanford in the contest with the
University of California four weeks
hence. O. C. Spencer was named
as alternate. All four men are ex
perienced debaters, and have repre
sented their classes in various con
tests. Hitter besides was a mem
ber of the Varsity team that met
the University of Washington last
year. Lewis, Ritter, and Spencer
are members of the Euphronia De
bating Society, and Koehr belongs
to the San Jose Debating Society.
All four are members of the Class
of '04. The judges were Professors
Duniway, Newcomer, and Alden.
H. C. Jones presided, and E. \V.
Rice acted as timer. Both have
been Carnot debaters.
The question under considera
tion was: "Resolved, That the
French policy of guaranteeing div
idends on railway investments has
been for the public interest." It
was understood that the question
would be connected with the French
railways, but, in conformity with
the new agreement, its exiict nature
was not announced until one hour
before the debate. Thus the inten
tion of the founder, Baron Pierre
de Coubertin, that the debate
should be to develop extemporane
ous speaking, has been returned to.
There were nine speakers in the
try-out Friday night: four for the
affirmative and five for the nega
tive. Sides were chosen by lot, and
each speaker was allowed twelve
minutes. Of the successful candi
dates, Roehr spoke for the affirma
tive, and Ritter, Lewis, and Spen
cer for the negative.
W. E. Hillings, '03, was the first
speaker. He had the affirmative
to uphold. The guaranteeing of
dividends, said he, was the funda
mental principle of the present
French railway system. When the
question of railways first arose,
public ownership was agitated, but
the great lesson taught by the
French Revolution was remembered,
and the policy of government aid
was decided upon as a compromise.
The government was unable to un
dertake the construction of railways
alone, and timid private capital
would not. A government guaran
tee therefore became a necessity.
It was believed that this policy
would awaken popular interest,and
that the working people would in
vest their small savings. It was
contended by Mr. Hillings that
these expectations had been fully
realized. "The present policy," he
said, "has upbuilt France It has
developed the industrial and com
mercial life of the nation. It has
prevented disastrous rate wars and
has maintained stable rntes. It is
not a severe strain on t!)«-'govern
ment and the people, for the guar
antees are to be refunded, as is be
ing done even now. Last year it
is calculated that the government
saved $24,000,000 in the transpor

tation of troops, supplies, mails,
etc., and the taxation on the rail
roads amounted to $17,000,000.
The present policy has strength
ened the government of France by
assimilating the interests of the
people and joining those interests
with the interests of the govern
ments."
A. M. Dibble, '05, opened for the
negative. The present system of
railway subsidies in France is dan
gerous. Kates have been higher in
France than in any other country
of Europe, and the government has
not been able to compel the lines to
lower them, for it might itself be
called topon to make up a deficit.
15y its policy of guaranteeing divi
dends, its hands have been effectu
ally tied. The railroads' monopoly

frees them of the danger of compe
tition, and their demands are con
stantly growing. The government
has been paying enormous sums to
them when the lines were actually
realizing handsome profits. The
guarantees are entirely too extrav
agant.
J. H. Page, '03, was the second
speaker for the affirmative. He
claimed that all the countries of
Europe and even the United States
had found it expedient to subsidize
various railroads, and he laid stress
on the fact that France, surrounded
by possibly hostile nations, must
have control of an elaborate system
of railroads to meet any military
exigency. The people, too, found
a safe way of investing their small
savings.
O. C. Spencer, '04, who was sub
sequently chosen as alternate, fol
lowed Page. He admitted subsi
dies had been granted in the United
States, but he said the payments
had ceased immediately the lines
were able to stand of their own ac
cord. In Germany the same sys
tem had been tried, but had failed,
and the government had taken over

to the San Jose Debating Society.
All four are members of the Class
of '04. The judges were Professors
Duniway, Newcomer, and Alden.
H. C. Jones presided, and E. \V.
Rice acted as timer. Both have
been Carnot debaters.
The question under considera
tion was: "Resolved, That the
French policy of guaranteeing div
idends on railway investments has
been for the public interest." It
was understood that the question
would be connected with the French
railways, but, in conformity with
the new agreement, its exiict nature
was not announced until one hour
before the debate. Thus the inten
tion of the founder, Baron Pierre
de Coubertin, that the debate
should be to develop extemporane
ous speaking, has been returned to.
There were nine speakers in the
try-out Friday night: four for the
affirmative and five for the nega
tive. Sides were chosen by lot, and
each speaker was allowed twelve
minutes. Of the successful candi
dates, Roehr spoke for the affirma
tive, and Ritter, Lewis, and Spen
cer for the negative.
W. E. Hillings, '03, was the first
speaker. He had the affirmative
to uphold. The guaranteeing of
dividends, said he, was the funda
mental principle of the present
French railway system. When the
question of railways first arose,
public ownership was agitated, but
the great lesson taught by the
French Revolution was remembered,
and the policy of government aid
was decided upon as a compromise.
The government was unable to un
dertake the construction of railways
alone, and timid private capital
would not. A government guaran
tee therefore became a necessity.
It was believed that this policy
would awaken popular interest,and
that the working people would in
vest their small savings. It was
contended by Mr. Hillings that
these expectations had been fully
realized. "The present policy," he
said, "has upbuilt France It has
developed the industrial and com
mercial life of the nation. It has
prevented disastrous rate wars and
has maintained stable rntes. It is
not a severe strain on t!)«-'govern
ment and the people, for the guar
antees are to be refunded, as is be
ing done even now. Last year it
is calculated that the government
saved $24,000,000 in the transpor

tation of troops, supplies, mails,
etc., and the taxation on the rail
roads amounted to $17,000,000.
The present policy has strength
ened the government of France by
assimilating the interests of the
people and joining those interests
with the interests of the govern
ments."
A. M. Dibble, '05, opened for the
negative. The present system of
railway subsidies in France is dan
gerous. Kates have been higher in
France than in any other country
of Europe, and the government has
not been able to compel the lines to
lower them, for it might itself be
called topon to make up a deficit.
15y its policy of guaranteeing divi
dends, its hands have been effectu
ally tied. The railroads' monopoly

frees them of the danger of compe
tition, and their demands are con
stantly growing. The government
has been paying enormous sums to
them when the lines were actually
realizing handsome profits. The
guarantees are entirely too extrav
agant.
J. H. Page, '03, was the second
speaker for the affirmative. He
claimed that all the countries of
Europe and even the United States
had found it expedient to subsidize
various railroads, and he laid stress
on the fact that France, surrounded
by possibly hostile nations, must
have control of an elaborate system
of railroads to meet any military
exigency. The people, too, found
a safe way of investing their small
savings.
O. C. Spencer, '04, who was sub
sequently chosen as alternate, fol
lowed Page. He admitted subsi
dies had been granted in the United
States, but he said the payments
had ceased immediately the lines
were able to stand of their own ac
cord. In Germany the same sys
tem had been tried, but had failed,
and the government had taken over
control of the lines. The system of
guaranteeing dividends had de
stroyed the commercial spirit of the
people, who were ever becoming

! more and more dependent upon the
government.
M. S. Lewis, '04, and A. S. Wil
liams, '03, then spoke for the affirm
; ative and negative respectively.
Frank Roehr, '04, who followed,
/ was the only speaker on the affirm
i ative side to win a place on the
team. Roehr's statement of facts
was far better than his delivery,
but he did very well after he had
once warmed up. Replying to the
previous speakers for the negative,
lie said there had been no spirit of
commercialism in France to kill.
It was to raise such a spirit that
guarantees of dividends were given.
Without guarantees, he said, the
railroads could never have been
built. The guarantee was not a
gift; it was a loan to be repaid at

four per cent interest, and the rail
roads are even now hurrying to get
out of the government's debt, for
they could get capital elsewhere.
The railway system of France was
based upon a comprehensive plan.
For military reasons, lines had to
be built in sections whore they
could not be expected to be profit
able, and the government was com
pelled to guarantee dividends.
O. H. Ritter, '04, followed for the
negative. Ritter showed that he
well deserved a place on the team.
He has a very pleasing address,
and with his complete self-control
under the new conditions, he ought
to make a close fight for the Carnot
medal. The republican form of


Jw H.3itter
administration in France, Ritter
Baid, bound up the welfare of the
government in the welfare of the
peoplr If the guaranteeing of div
idends on railway investments was
detrimental to the people, it was
dangerous to the government. It
was necessary that the same idea
of independence that one finds in
England and America he developed
in France; and it had not been, be
cause the people expected the gov
ernment to take care of them under
any circumstances. The idea of
paternalism was the curse of the
nation. The companies make im
mense profits on their present in
vestment, and are satisfied to ig
nore questions of improvement.
H. M. Lewis, '04, was the closing
speaker for the negative. Lewis
had some very good points and
made them in an emphatic way,
although he spoke a little too rap
idly to get the best effect. The
policy of guaranteeing dividends,
he said, had been neither an eco
nomic nor a military advantage.
If the country had excellent canals
and roads, why should the govern
ment force upon the people a sys
tem of railroads? France had able
financiers, and if railroads were de
manded by the people, the demand
would meet with ready response
from private capital. The bonds
of these subsidized lines cannot be
secured by the common people.
They are held by the Rothschilds,
and sold away above par. The
guarantee system has resulted only
in poor service, gross mismanage
ment, and unjust charges. At
tempts to transport large bodies of
troops in recent years have failed
dismally. Directors who did little
are paid enormous salaries, and re
sponsibility is extremely lax. The
people are heartily sick of the ex
periment. Lewis then cited a
number of steps that have been
taken toward government owner
ship.
This ended the statements, and
Billings and Roehr then spoke in
rebuttal for the affirmative, and
Dibble for the negative. Each man
was allowed one minute.
The judges then retired, and
after fifteen minutes deliberation
announced their decision in favor
of H. M. Lewis, Roehr, and Ritter.
Professor Duniway said he and his
colleagues were well pleased with
the speeches.
There were about two hundred

people at the try-out, and the
speakers were heartily applauded.
From the standpoint of enthusiasm
and attendance it was probably the
most successful try-out ever held at
Stanford.
