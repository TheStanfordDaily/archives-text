The Department of Music o( the Thoburn School.
We call the attention of students who desire
to continue their study of music while at the
University to the excellent department of
music of the Thoburn School at Palo Alto.
This new department of the promising young
institution is directed by Mr. Arthur Ficken
sehor, who teaches piano and harmony, the in
struction in vooal music being in tho hands of
Mrs. Fickenscher. Mr. Fickenscher does not
need an introduction to the faculty and students
of Stanford. Ho is recognized as one of tho
foremost pianists and teachers of music on the
Pacitlo Coast. As a composer, he ranks among
the first in this country. In her recent visit to
San Francisco, Frau Schumann Heinck, the
famous contralto, asked it as a special favor
that Mr. Fickenscher dedicate several of his
songs to her.
To be instructed by an artist like Mr. Fiokon
scher is a privi'ege of which many will gladly
avail themselves.
