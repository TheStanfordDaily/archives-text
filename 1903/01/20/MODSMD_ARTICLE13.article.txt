The most gratifying phase of the
Carnot finals last Friday night was
the fact that each man had taken
seriously to his subject, showing
an appreciation of the fact that
thorough preparation is necessary
to successful argument. This was
in marked contrast to the efforts of
the Freshman debaters, who a few
evenings before exhibited not so
much a lack of depth in their argu
ment as a lack of knowledge of their
subject matter. The Carnot men
are to be commended upon the
attitude they have taken toward
the new conditions surrounding the
Carnot. The debate as now ar
ranged calls for a larger amount of
hard work in preparation for the
finals than ever before. The Uni
versity debaters without exception
have accepted the changes and
gone to their tasks with a will.
The fact that the members of the
Carnot and Intercollegiate teams
are nearly always chosen from the
two upper classes points to the fact
that our debating system is con
ducive to the development of public
speakers.
