# CARNOT AND CALIFORNIA.
## Books at Command of the Debaters Rather Limited at Both California and Stanford. 
### 
Frank Stern,'o3, A. B. Weiler,
'03, and Max Thelan, '04, with A. P.
Mathew, '03, alternate, have been
chosen to represent the University
of California in the Carnot. These
men are all inexperienced in Inter
collegiate debating except Thelan
who was a member of California's
winning team last year.
In view of the fact that only nine
students at California had an
nounced themselves as condidates
for the Carnot team, the usual pre
liminary try-out was done away
with this year, and the only con
test for place was the finals last
Friday. As explanation for this
surprising lack of interest in an
Intercollegiate contest, it is stated
in the San Francisco papers that
the University of California library
contains only a few books on the
subject of French railroads, while
the Hopkins Railway Library at
Stanford, which is reported to be
the largest and most complete in
this country, contains eighty.
As a matter of fact there have
been found to be in the Hopkins
Library forty volumes touching
upon the subject of the Carnot.
Of these fully one-half are of a
general nature and half are in
French or Italian and all are con
siderably out of date. A special
appropriation for books for Carnot
debates was made a month ago at
California and the libraries of San
Francisco and Oakland are acces
sible to all California students.
Librarian Dodge a few days ago
wrote to J. C. Rowell, Librarian at
California, offering the California
Carnot debaters the use of the
books in . the Stanford Library.
Mr. Rowell in answer states that
the matter has been left with the
California debaters.
