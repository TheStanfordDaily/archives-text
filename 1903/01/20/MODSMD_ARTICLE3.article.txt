# SUMMER SCHOOL CHANGES.
## Undergraduate Courses at Hopkins Laboratory Give Place to Original Investigation. 
### 
At a meeting of the Faculty
Committee of the Timothy Hopkins
Laboratory, held before the holi
days, it was decided to do away
with the elementary summer work
at Pacific Grove. In the future no
course will be offered in elementary
zoology, physiology, and botany
and iio undergraduate credit will be
given for work done at the Labora
tory unless especially arranged for.
More attention will be given to orig
inal investigation than ever before.
The idea is to have at the Labor
atory investigators who are at
tracted by the work rather than by
the credit. The change is in the
nature of an improvement rather
than a cutting off of the efficiency
of the Laboratory. A more sys
tematic and thorough survey of the
Bay of Monterey will be under
taken. Great opportunities will be
offered to the student wishing to do
original investigation. It will be a
corner of the University where
each student can work out original
problems for himself in nature's
workshop, receiving all necessary
assistance, and with the element of
credit eliminated. Advantage will
be taken of the holidays and of
every low tide.
To those students who have had
the elementary instruction and are
prepared for the advance work, the
fees will be small, merely enough
to cover the cost of the material
used. Six or seven men worked
at the Laboratory during the recent
vacation.
A number of causes have led up
to this decision on the part of the
Faculty Committee of which the
most important is the desire to en
courage original scientific research
for the work's sake.
