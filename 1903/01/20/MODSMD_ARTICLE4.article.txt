# Stanford Senate Bill.
## 
### 
A bill was introduced in the
State Senate by Senator Shortridge
of San Jose, which provides that
the Trustees of Stanford University
be empowered to commence pro
ceedings to determine the legal
status of the various trusts and
amendments of the University un
der the provisions of the educa
tional bills of 1885 and 1887.
These bills were general in applica
tion and not confined to the condi
tions existing or likely to exist in
the case of Stanford University.
In the case of Stanford Univer
sity the title to the property is se
cured under the provisions of the
constitutional amendment, but
there are still doubts as to the val
idity and legal effect of certain
clauses of the University trusts and
amendments which might be em
barrassing to the trustees when
they come into the management of
the University. These clauses pro
vide for a change in the number of
trustees from twenty-four to fifteen,
and of their term of office from life
to ten years, There is also a re
quirement that the University
shall always keep in harmony with
the public school system, and a
provision against a possible future
dictation to the high schools by the
University.
