# DR. NEWTON'S ADDRESS.
## "Faith, Hope, and Charity, but the Greatest of These is Charity." 
### 
The dedication of the Stanford
Memorial Church next Sunday
morning was to mark the entrance
upon Dr. Newton's public services
here, hut Sunday his colleague,
Dr. Gardner, being ill, he preached
for the first time at Stanford in the
chapel. He took as his text the
famous words of St. Paul: "And
now abideth faith, hope, and char
ity, these three; but the greatest of
these is charity."
Charity is greater than faith and
greater than hope because it is the
longest-lived; because it is the hard
est to win; because when won it
gives the divinest benediction to
life; because the relation of charity
to faith and hope declares its supe
riority; and because charity is the
fruition of religion itself, the life in
which all religions are made one,
and charity, born before her divine
sisters, will outlive them. The
time may come when we shall not
walk by faith, and we may not live
by hope in the land beyond. But
who shall say when or where we
part with love?
Hope has led men into half their
failures. Faith has burned libra
ries, closed schools, anathemized
science, stayed progress, and
brought great evils to civilization.
Faith has created the most tyran
nous of tyrants, destroying the
freedom of thought in the greatest
church in Christendom; faith has
created a censorship of the press.
Protestantism and Romanism do
not regard truth of such import as
the truth as held by their fathers.
Such truth is arrested, stereotyped.
Faith, with its tendency to narrow
the human intellect, has also soured
the human heart and filled the
world with hatred, strife, and the
horrors of persecution and war.
Love has wrought no evil upon
the earth, nor has it run to excess.
What cloud has it cast; what in
tellect exposed; what progress has
it stayed; what persecution and
wars haa it brought about? The
work of charity has been good, and
only good. What the world wants
today is not so much a religion of
faith or of hope; not a herbarium
where we may study the roots of
life, but a flower-garden, where we
may rejoice in the beauty of life.
Christianity should ijow be blos
soming. There should be all the
power of root-life and the growth of
truth. These should be blossom
ing into human love in which the
ills of life are mastered.
