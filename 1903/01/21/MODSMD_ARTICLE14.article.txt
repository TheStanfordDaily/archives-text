There has been a little misun
derstanding concerning the seating
arrangements for the dedication of
Memorial Church. In handling
the immense crowd which will that
day expect to be admitted to the
services some difficulty must nec
essarily be had, but it has been the
object of those in charge to avoid
all friction and give the greatest
amount of satisfaction possible.
Mrs. Stanford, recognizing the im
practicability of providing for the
seating of all her friends and those
who were the friends of Senator
Stanford, has decided not to issue
tickets. Arrangements for seating
those who are closely connected
with the University have been care
fully planned. In order to facili
tate matters a strict adherence to
the regulations must be had.
Everyone who expects to attend
the services should read carefully
the announcements published in
tonight's issue. There will be no
pushing and crowding. When the
Church is filled the doors will be
closed. Particular care should be
taken by students, alumni, and
members of the faculty that they
arrive on time for the public at
10:50 will be admitted and every
available space filled. No one
should encourage friends to attend
the dedication expecting to get
in to the morning service. The
room that will be left after the re
served spaces are filled will be very
small. On the other hand it is
well to remember that for the after
noon services, no reservations will
he made.
