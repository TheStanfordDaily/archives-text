While in the East President Jor
dan spoke for the Indianapolis
News on the question of shortening
the college course.
"Some institutions are so placed,"
he said, "that they can not give the
training that should rightly be
giyen. The college situated in the
center of a great city can not have
the personal atmosphere, the close
relations between student and fac
ulty, which are the most potent
part of a college. In Princeton
and Cornell the last two years are
the most valuable. When a college
is so placed, with itß true college
atmosphere, its culture and work,
its personal relations between the
students and faculty, to shorten the
course to two years is impossible.
"But if a college is located in a
city where no one knows any one
else, and the true relations between
faculty and student are wanting, it
does advanced high school work.
The students have just finished a
long course in the preparatory
school, and are anxious to get to
their professional courses. Institu
tions in great cities have never yet
done successful college work as a
rule, but their facilities forluniver
sity work are better. A shorter
college course may be necessary for
them.
"Such institutions as Stanford
do their best work in their last two
years, and must retain them. The
students may do professional work
in these years, but under the direc
tion of the college faculty. The
elective system makes it possible to
give each student what ho needs —
the broader horizon, culture, inde
pendent investigation, and a basis
for professional work.
"President Wilson of Princeton
said a good thing recently: 'No one
who has seen a sophomore would
every think of granting him a de
gree.' "
