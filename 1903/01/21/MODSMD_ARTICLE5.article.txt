# WORK ON THE TRACK.
## Track Men Warming up in Preparation for Hard Trials Later in the Season. 
### 
The track squad has been doing
light work for the last few days.
They are rapidly getting over the
first aches and pains of prelimi
nary training, and by the first of
February will be running hard
trials. This light work is given
with the intention of building up a
foundation for harder and more
strenuous training. The rubber
will be here by the first of Febru
ary in time to take care of the men
when they are doing the hardest
part of the season's work.
The broad-jumpers and high
jumpers have not been working at
their particular events, but have
been going off the mark and getting
speed for their runs. The sprinters
have also been doing some starting.
A rubbing-room is being built at
the oval near the ticket office, a
step that will facilitate matters
and avoid a great many inconven
iences.
Though there has been no at
tempt at trials, several records have
been made which are very good for
this season. W. E. Crawford, '05,
has within the last few days thrown
the hammer 138 feet; A. M. Thom
son, '03, has done a half-mile in
2:10 2-5, and his brother, W. H.
Thomson, '05, in 2:26; F. A.
Smith, '05, ran the half in 2:19;
and H. W. Bell, '05, made five feet
six inches in the high jump.
Manager Edwards is in receipt
of an offer from Manager L. W.
Frisbee of the University of Wash
ington to hold a meet with the
Stanford track team on the Stan
ford campus. The proposition is
being considered by the manage
ment.
