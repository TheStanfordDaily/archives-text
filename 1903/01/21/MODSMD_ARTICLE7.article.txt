Owing to the fact that there are
to be two services in the Church
each Sunday, the service formerly
conducted hy the Christian Asso
ciations Sunday evening have been
abandoned. Partly in lieu of this
the Y. M. C. A. has planned for a
series of addresses in the chapel to
be delivered on Tuesday evenings
from 7to 7:45. The advice of the

high order, and so pertinent to the
life of college men, that they will
command the interest and support
of the men of the University.
