Tomorrow night the musical
clubs will give their return concert
in Assembly Hall. They have
met everywhere with success and
are quoted in as high terms as any
organization that ever represented
Stanford. Through no fault of the
management a deficit has been in
curred. It remains for the student
body to remove this deficit and to
show appreciation of the men
who have done much to better the
fair name of Stanford in the north
ern states.
