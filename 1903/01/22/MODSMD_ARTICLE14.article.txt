It is sometimes discouraging to
those who are striving to make the
Daily Palo Alto what it ought to
be, thoroughly representative of
Stanford activities, to find in ex
istence among a large number of
students and members of the faculty
a spirit which deems close-mouthed
carefulness a necessary adjunct to
their existence. In the past the
Daily has covered its field and
covered it well, but a vast amount
of hard work might have been
saved the members of the staff if
each student, professor, and in
structor had had the courtesy to
recognize the fact that the college
publication served their interests
as well as the interests of the board
of editors. The attitude of some of
the men of the University is "little
short of outrageous. Some of those
holding unc'orgraduate offices, and
they of all others should do the
most to help student activities
along, maintain not only an in
difference toward the Daily, but
also refuse to give information con
cerning subjects in which there is
not the slightest call for caution or
secrecy. Whether overwhelmed by
the preponderance of the honors

conferred upon them or not needs
not to be said. In striking con
trast to these are those who show
an appreciation of the difficulties
that naturally confront our news
gatherers. The men and women
who conscientiously save items for
our assistants have our thanks.
They are numerous, much more
numerous than the tenor of this
editorial might lead some to think.
That there should be among us any
who have the lack of perspective
which they should have is to be
deplored.
