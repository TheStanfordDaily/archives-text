The Foundry is at last in work
ing order and, although not fully
equipped, there was poured from
the cupola yesterday about two tons
of molten iron. The "heat," as it is
called, was very satisfactory and
gave the students a pretty good
idea of what their work in the de
partment will be. Six moulding
ladles and a great many tools
which have been ordered for the
foundry have not yet arrived hut
will be placed in position as soon
as possible.
In the pattern-shop the members
of the class are working on a large
pattern for a band-saw frame, the
main casting of which will be over
seven feet in height. They are also
building patterns for a power ham
mer for the forge shop. The tools
for which the patterns are now be
ing made will not be completed
and in running order for two years
yet, as it is the plan in the shops
to have the same students who
make the patterns also make the
castings, and, in their third year,
machine these castings.
The balance of the machine shop
equipment has been received and is
in course of erection.
