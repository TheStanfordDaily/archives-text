### 
The Columbia Park Boys' Club,
some of whose members will give a
concert in Assembly Hall on
Thursday, January 29th, is one of
the moßt notable social organiza
tions in the United States. It was
fifteen years ago that its prototype,
the old San Francisco Boys' Club,
was founded in the "south of
Market" by Gelett Burgess, Sidney
Peixotto, and other men now wide
ly known in the literary and artis
tic world. Success killed that
famous organization, and its foun
ders drifted away.
In 1895 Sidney Peixotto returned
from New York, where he had been
engaged at the old University Set
tlement, and founded at 318 Sev
enth street, the Columbia Park
Boys' Club. Since that time, and
in the face of opposition and diffi
culty, he has held to his ideals
with a tactful persistence which
amounts to genius. The result is
that he has established a club so
perfectly organized and so ably
supported that its success is phe
nomenal. Without exaggeration
it may be said that the Columbia
Park Boys' Club is the most suc
cessful boys' club in America. Its
well-drilled band has frequent en
gagements in the city. The mili
tary company is included in all
the important parades. In gym
nastic exhibitions the boys also ex
cel. As an indication of their de
velopment, in a public exhibition
given at the Y. M. C. A. building
in San Francisco one of the boys
dipped and chinned to the rings
twenty-seven times, while three
others made a record of twenty-one
times.
For years Mr. Peixotto has been
training the boys in music and act
ing. He has developed some fin
ished artists —boys who can render
classical music in a masterly man
ner, and also do "coon-songs" and
fancy dancing. Some of his work
ers are artists and teachers of re
pute.
It should not be inferred that,
because the Columbia Park Boye
come from "south of Market," they
are therefore rough and ill-man
nered. All of them have the bear
ing of gentlemen. The conduct of
the boys is, indeed, one of the most
pleasing and interesting features of
Mr. Peixotto's work.
