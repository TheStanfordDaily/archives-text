Through a mistake in the meas
urements sent to the eastern manu
facturers the bronze doors for the
small front entrances of the Church
have been found to be four inches
too long,for the space allowed them.
The dimensions taken for the

large main dcor were used. The
error has made it necessary to cut
off four inches of stone, and this ex
tra work makes it very doubtful if
the bronze doors can be in place in
time for the dedication exercises
Sunday. Swinging doors are being
hung in the entrances fromthe lobby
to the Church. The Italians
are rushing the mosaics over
the side entrances. The figure on
the east side is nearing completion,
but it is barely possible that Sun
day will see it finished
The stairs leading to the organ
loft are being boarded up. This is
done to shut out the cold draughts
of air that swept up the stairs and
over into the body of the Church.
