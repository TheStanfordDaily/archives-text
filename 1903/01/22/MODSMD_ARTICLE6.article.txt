# Want Serious Work Done.
## 
### 
The preceptors of the affiliated
colleges of the University of Cali
fornia have expressed themselves
as displeased because certain ath
letes have been using their schools
as a means for qualifying them
selves for participation in under
graduate and intercollegiate ath
letics. They say this will not be
tolerated in the future. Hereafter
students will have to satisfy the
instructors that they are there for
serious work. During the fall Cap
tain Albertson of the California
football team and Captain Middle
ton of their Freshman team took
advantage of these schools to regis
ter, but have never been in serious
attendance since.
