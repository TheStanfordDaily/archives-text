# WORK ON THE DIAMOND.
## Players Rounding into Form.—Infield Practice and Stick-work the Daily Features. 
### 
For the past week the old ball
field has been the scene of hard
consistent work on the part of
coach, captain, and players. The
old Varsity men are rapidly work
ing off the wildnesß and inaccuracy
incident to a long period of ab
sence from the diamond. The men
who will form this year's second
team have been faithful in their
endeavors to develop good form in
the field and at the bat. Of the
new men several have shown them
selves to be of unusual strength.
The first line-up of the season
was held last Saturday, when a
snappy practice game was played
between the first and second teams.
All of the pitchers were given a
trial and many shifts were made
in the line-up before work was
ended. Neither side experienced
a great deal of difficulty in hitting
the ball, but the numerous runs
tallied were the result of inaccurate
throwing to bases and poor han
dling of the ball in the field.
The men who in all probability
will constitute the Varsity infield
have begun to play very well to
gether. Cowden at first is rapidly
rounding into his old form.
Brown has been playing second
and Crawford his old position at
short. Both men are sure fielders,
and are strong and accurate in
throwing to bases. At third Copp
promises to be a fixture. Behind
the bat McGilvray seems a cer
tainty.
The outfield offers the greatest
chance to the new men. Blake,
Lowenthal, and Knight of last
year's Varsity, besides many of last
year's second team and a host of
freshmen,are fighting for the places.
There are a number of men who
are sure in the field, but it is not
there that the place will be won.
The man who is strong both at the
bat and in fielding will be the log
ical man for the place.
The routine of daily practice in
cludes a short turn at the bat for
the individual men, warming up
by the pitchers, and sharp infield
practice for the first and second
team men. In the outfield there is
always a group of players working
on long flies.
The first Varsity game will be
played with Santa Clara on the
31st of this month, and by that
time the team should be together
and playing fairly good baseball.
