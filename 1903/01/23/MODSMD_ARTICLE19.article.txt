The time when Stanford will
send her tennis men up against the
California players is fust approach
ing, and wo he;ir little concerning
the building of the new tennis
court. Manager Edwards has
through the subscription committee
found the student body unusually
responsive, but he has made no
great effort to push the cause owing
to the fact that the contract bids had
not been acted upon by the Execu
tive Committee. Lust, Wednesday
evening the committee deferred ac
tion for no other reason than that
it wanted time to deliberate on the
perplexities of the plan for laying
the new court tic rose two of the old
ones. A week's delay now means
a week less practice for our Varsity
men, a smaller chance of defeating
our rivals next April. The propo
sition has hung lire long enough.
We want to see the contractors at
work, and that immediately.
