# Meeting of Freshmen.

### 
A meeting of the Freshman class
has been called for Wednesday,
January 28th, at 1:10 in the chapel.
Action will be taken concerning the
debt against the class for their foot
ball sweaters, and on the outlook
for spring athletics. A new assess
ment will be necessary to meet the
deficit and to provide jerseys for
the baseball and track teams. The
class is without a president, J. E.
Campbell, the manchosen last week,
having resigned. One will be
elected on Wednesday.
