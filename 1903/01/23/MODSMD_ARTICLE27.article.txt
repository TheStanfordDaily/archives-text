# Hurdler Cheek Again at Berkeley.
## 
### 
Herbert Cheek, the crack hurdler
and high jumper of the University
of California, bas re-entered college
for the spring semester. Cheek
quit some time ago with the stated
intention of going to Siam to attend
to various business interests which
he had inherited from his father.
He has reconsidered his determina
tion to depart at once, however,
and is likely to take part in the
intercollegiate contest in April.
Berkeley men regard this as assur
ing California first place in the
hurdles.
