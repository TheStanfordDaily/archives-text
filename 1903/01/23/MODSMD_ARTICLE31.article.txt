A Twicnty-fivk-cbnt letter tablet
of superior quality for ten cents is
the Intent bargain at the Bookstore.
Somebody made a mistake and
shipped a San Francisco house un
ruled instead of ruled pads. They
could not use them, but the mana
gers of the Bookstore knew that
Stanford people would be glad to;
do so.
'J 1 he supply is limited.
