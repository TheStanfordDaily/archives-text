### 
The fifty-three men who are sub
stituting track for gymnasium
work were excused from the gym
nasium today. From this time on
they will not be required to report
in the gymnasium, but will work
under the direction of Captain Mc-
Caughern. It is interesting to note
that many of the best gymnasts
are taking track work.
In spite of the showers last night
the track is in condition to work
on, both on the back stretch and
on the sprints. Men have been
working there all today, under the
personal direction of Trainer Moul
ton and Captain McCaughern.
The new rubbing-room, which has
just been finished on the oval, was
moved this morning several yards
down the track, by about twenty
five men from Encina Hall.
The meet with the University of
Washington is still under consid
eration. The financial risk is great,
but as both the manager and cap
tain are greatly desirous of several
meets this season the meet may be
run off.
