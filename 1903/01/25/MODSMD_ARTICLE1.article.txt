# MEMORIAL CHURCH.
## Description of the Building That Today is Dedicated to the Glory of God and the Uses of Religion. 
### 
After long years of planning and
building, the majestic Church stands
complete, a memorial to one of the
founders of the Leland Stanford
Junior University.
Viewed from any point on the
campus the Memorial Church is

imposing, tower
ing as it does
above the red
tiled roofs round
it like a mighty
redwood above
its fellows. Its
architectural
conception is a
combination of
the Moorish and
thellomanesque.
From the south,
whence a com
prehensive view
of the apse and
the transept can
be had, but little
that has not a
strong Roman
esque flavor can
be seen.
The material
used in construc
tion was buff
sandstone, quar
ried in the Santa
Cruz Mountains,
rough hewn on
the exterior, tool
finished on the
interior. From
the Inner Quad
rangle are three
entrances; huge
oaken doors at
thecenter,bronze
doors on either
side. There are
entrances at the
wings of the
transepts. The
front end of the
Church rises out
of ibe corridor
which surrounds
the quad. Its
surface has been
covered with the
Italian mosaic,
and across in

carved stone is the inscription:
"Erected to the Glory of God and
in Loving Memory of My Husband,
Leland Stanford." The carving on
the arches is marvelously done.
The church is cruciform. It is
one hundred and ninety feet in
length and one hundred and fifty
six feet in width, the latter measure
ment taken through the transepts.
Above the place where the bars of
the crucifix meet are the dome and
tower, one hundred and ninety fent
to the tip of the gilded cross, one
hundred and six feet to the fullest
height of the dome. Below the
tower on ench side are Gothic flying
buttresses. The four corners of the
church are flunked by turrets which
rise from the angles between the
gables. In the tower is the clock,
and tlie chimes which ring out
every quarter of an hour, both day

and night: a duplicate of the chimes
on England's Parliament building.
The clock turns its faces to the east,
the west, the north and the south.
The tower contains twenty-four
pictorial windows. The inner fin
ishing of the Church baffles descrip-

! tion. From the Moorish tiled floor
to the groined oaken ceiling the
interior design and symmetry are
perfect. The four wide Roman
arches, elaborately carved in lace
like tracery, measuring fifty-two
feet across, rest on four great pil
lars and support a dome of great
beauty and finish. The carving on
the arches and columns is of won
derful workmanship. The intricacy
and detail of the design lose none
| of their artistic value when exam
ined closely and in detail. Carven
cherubs surmount the capitals.
From these arches spring a cove
ceiling bearing the figures of angels
in mosaic work. Above the cove
ceiling is a circle thirty-two feet in
diameter surrounded by a railing.
Above is the top of the dome. It
is when standing directly beneath
the dome that the visitor, gazing

straight upward past the arches
and the mosaic work into the
heights of the richly frescoed dome,
realizes more than ever before the
immensity and the magnificence
of the building.
The interior color effect is ob
tained not by the surfaces of the
wood and stone but by the windows,
mosaics, and fresco work.
The apse with its marble altar,
its great memorial windows of
stained glass, its marble statues of
the twelve apostles, and its mosaic

covered walls, is approached by a
flight of white marble stairs reach
ing from one pillar of the great
arch to the other, from the pulpit
to the ledum. The altar, surround
ed as it is by the richest decoration
of the edifice, is of purest white
Carrara marble. The candelabra,
the life-size marble figures, a repre
sentation of Thorwaldson's "Holy
Family," and the bas-relief of Ru
ben's painting, "TheEntombment,''
are its features.
The Italian artists with infinite
patience and skill have fitted up
on the walls of the chancel thou
sands of squares of stone and glass,
(he figures and scenes brought out
on a background of gold. The up
per series depict Michael Angelo's
Old Testament prophets, John,
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Samuel, David,
Elias, Moses, and Isaias. And be

low on either side running to the
edge of the great stone arch are a
"Gloria dei Angeli," "seraphic
chorus, hymning the wonder of the
incarnation and the victory of the
world's Redeemer."
Beneath the mosaics, seated in
niches of burnished gold, six on
either side of the altar, are the
statues of the twelve apostles.
To the left is the pulpit of stone,
artistically carved upon it are lilies;
the cross, and figures of divine im
port. And beside the west pillar

of the chancel
arch stands the
lecturn.
In the end of
the Church op
posite the chan
cel, above the
mosaic floor and
carved supports,
is the organ
loft, with its
beautiful pipes
shiningon either
side of the won
derful rose win
dow.
The seating
capacity of the
building is one
thousand seven
hundred people.
The architec
tural conception
of the Church is
in keeping with
the general plan
of the University
buildings, which
in style are rem
iniscent of the
Mission build
ings and Span
i s h -California.
The quadrangle,
surrounded by
spacious arched
corridors,the red
tiled roofs, take
one irresistably
back to the day
of the padre. As
in those days, so
now upon the
Church has been
lavished the
skill, the care,
the wealth and
the devotion of
those who have
been in the
building of it.

Architect Clinton Day has planned
with a skill, a regard for strength
and beauty. The Church stands not
only as a place for worship, a mem
orial for Senator Stanford, but
also as one of the world's treasures
in ecclesiastical architecture.
