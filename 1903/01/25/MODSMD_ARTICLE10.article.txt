# STORY OF THE CHURCH.
## How the Great Edifice Grew from Its Conception to Its Present State. 
### 
The erection of Memorial Church,
although the last of the buildings
of the Inner Quadrangle to take
shape, was no afterthought in the
mind of the surviving Founder of
the University. When the idea of
building the institution came to
Senator and Mrs. Stanford the
presence of a great church as the
keystone of the groups of one-story
structures was uppermost in their
thoughts. The exterior form of
the Church has always remained as
originally planned by Shelley, Ru
tan, and Coolidge of Boston, the
successors of the well-known Rich
ardson. While not a copy in any
sense of the word, the Church is
adapted somewhat after the famous
Trinity Church of Boston, in which
Phillips Brooks preached so long.
The finished edifice represents all
ages and countries. There are
traces of the hallowed cathedrals
that make Europe so fascinating
to the American traveler, while
more than one touch suggests the
charming Saint Mark's Cathedral
in Venice. When all has been
said and written about the Church
and the architects, the one thing
becomes fixed in the minds of all
who have watched the growth of
the great temple of worship, and
that is that the beauty of the fin
ished Church is due entirely to the
judgment and taste of Mrs. Stan
ford. She it was who selected

every piece of design. The archi
tects worked under her direc
tion. The mosaics were chosen
by her in Italy. The designs of
the stained windows were selected
by her.
When Senator Stanford died the
only thing to guide her in her plan
ning for the structure was in the
bare outline of the cross-shaped ex
terior. It had not even been decid
ed to make the interior stone. When
the opportunity made it possi
ble to go ahead with the University
buildings, Mrs. Stanford called in
Clinton Day, of San Francisco, and
together they worked on the inter
ior of the Church. Those who have
daily watched the growth of the
building for the last four years can
testify to the number of changes
and alterations that have taken
place. Nothing has been too mi
nute or of so great magnitude as to
escape the eyes of those in charge,
and everything has been done with
the idea of making Memorial
Church a solid and massive exam
ple of the noble and dignified col
lege chapel.
The beginning of Memorial

Church can technically be traced
as far back as 1887, when the
arches that now front the Church
and form the continuous arcade
were built. Nothing further was
done until the spring of 1899, when
the contract for the foundations
was let to George Goodman, of San
Francisco, May 16, and ground was
broken for the structure a week
later. Shortly afterwards the
cornerstone was laid with quiet
but impressive ceremonies. The
contract for the stonework was
awarded to the McGilvray Stone
Company of San Francisco, at the
same time. Construction of the
walls went on slowly for the next
year. It was not until the fall of
1900 that operations proceeded
with any great speed. In October,
1900, the walls had reached the
desired height, and in December
the carpenters stepped in and be
gan work on the roof. The approach
of the new century saw the beauti
ful Gothic tower taking shape.
From the stone walls to the foot of
tbe cross, the tower is eighty feet
high; it was built by E. A. Hettin
ger, who had the contract for all
the exterior and interior woodwork.
The tile roofing was put on by
Gladding, Mc√üean & Company
of San Francisco. By the end
of the spring semester the
outlines of the finished structure
were present. The clock and chimes
were putin place in the latter part
of 1901, and the stained glass win
dows, furnished by J. &. It. Lamb of
New York, were fitted at the same
time. From November, 1900, to
March, 1902, when it was first de
cided to have the dedication, a large
force of stone-carvers was busy
chiseling the beautiful figures and
tracery that cover the walls. Dur
ing this period nearly ten carvers
were kept constantly at work. Car
penters began at about the same
time on their portion of the work,
and although the amount of wood
in the interior is very small the re
sults are admirable.
In the fall of 1901 the firm of
Salviati & Co., of Venice, Italy, sent
two of their artists to putin place
the mosaics. They toiled from
September to January on the altar
pieces, and a great deal of their
time was bestowed on the picture
of the Lord's Supper. It was at
this point that operations were
rushed with no uncertain tone.
The builders strained every nerve
to have the structure finished in
time for Founder's Day, March 9,
j the date originally set for the dedi
cation. During the busy season
over one hundred men were employ
ed on the building at one time. In
the first week of March the network
of scaffolding that had filled the
Church for two years was removed.
The tile floor was putin place by
Giletti & Co. of San Francisco, and
the marble altar and the statues by
Seregni & Bierneri of Italy, through
their San Francisco branch. L. &
E. Emanuel of San Francisco sup
plied the heavy oak pews, and the
Harris Organ Company of Los
Angeles installed the famous
organ. When it was found
impossible to have the Church
completed in time, the date
of dedication was extended to
Easter Sunday. This also was
found too soon. After several post
ponements January 25, 1903, was
chosen as the date for dedication.
In addition to the Church a circular
chancel on the southwest corner of
the Church has been added to be
used as a vestry for the preachers.
