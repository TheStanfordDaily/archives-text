# THE STANFORD ORGAN.
## Instrument of Three Thousand Pipes and Sixty-Six Stops Furnishes Music at Touch of Arthur L. Scott Brook. 
### 
For almost a year Stanford au
diences have been charmed by the
music of the organ. To adequately
describe it is a task hardly to be un
dertaken ; a few words must suf
lice for the present occasion.
The art of organ building is one
that ever strives toward higher per
fection. The instrument in Memo
rial Church is the most complete
and perfect of its kind,both mechan
ically and musically, in America.
Jt is a notable example of the
progress made in the manufacture
of church organs, and more partic-

ularly an example of the marvelous
results that have been obtained by
the application of electricity to the
producing of sweet sounds, the roll
and thunder of the great music.
Nearly two hundred feet from the
chancel, over the entrance doors, is
the gallery. In the center next the
railing and some thirty feet from
the rose window, is the console, or
key desk. On each side is arranged
one of the two organs, a space of
forty feet intervening; the organ
is thus divided into two equal por
tions. The grand instrument has
sixty-six stops, over three thousand
pipes, and contains thirty miles of
wire.
"The action is lighter in touch
than a grand piano, and has a
marvelous capacity for repetition,

being capable of greater rapidity
in speech than the quickest human
touch can produce. With the con
tact, made by depressing a key, the
current is completed through one
of the small insulated wires of the
connecting cable, with the magnet
inside the organ, which in turn
operates the pneumatic motors sup
plying wind to the pipes. The
same principle applies to the stop
action, couplers, combination action
and also to the swell shades.
<l The two bellows, of one hun
dred and twenty square feet area,

are blown by
a three and
one-half
horsepower
electric mo
tor. The to
tal weight of
the organ
is about
twenty - live
tons. Th e
price is $ 15,-
50 0. The
case is of
quarter
sawetl east
ern white
oak, antique
finish. The
front pipes,
ninety -six
in number,

are of pure block tin, polished
having the appearance of bur
nished silver."
Arthur L. Scott Brook came to
America from Australasia, where
he was organist for the largest
organ in the world. He has been
in the past by trade an organ
builder and musician. By con
tract with Mrs. Stanford he will
play each afternoon from 4 to 5,
and in so far as possible assume
direction of the musical interests of
the University. The Festival Choir
for the dedication was trained by
him. An important feature has
been made of the Sunday afternoon
recitals. Capable singers have
helped entertain large audiences.
The organ will be a large part of
every service.
