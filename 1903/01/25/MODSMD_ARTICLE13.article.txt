# WINDOWS OF MEMORIAL CHURCH.
## Wonderful Color Effects.â€”Stained Glass Tells the Story of the Life of the Lowly Nazarene. 
### 
There are in the world many ca
thedrals and many windows and
collections of windows. These have
been made sometimes one at a time,
sometimes several. But never has
an order been given for such a large
number at one time as was given by
Mrs. Stanford for Memorial Church.
And never have windows been
more carefully selected and execut
ed. The tinting and the theme fit

into the mas
terful plan un
derlying the
color decora
tion and the
a rch i tectural
conception.
When the sun
throws its glor
io us light
through these
wind o w s a
more glorious
lighgt tints the
altar and
mingles with
the magnifi
cence of the in
ner decoration.
Who at the

first sight of the three windows
which portray the Birth, the
Crucifixion, and the Ascension
of our Lord lias not stood in silent
admiration,--an admiration which
no man feels except in the presence
of godly influence.
"The Nativity " is from a picture
by Fellowes-Prynne; "The Cruci
fixion," from Degger; and the
" Ascension, " from Carlotti. The
rich setting for the infant figure of
Hoffman's youthful Christ makes
the rose window a wonderful and
beautful object.
Mrs. Stanford in making her se
lections examined hundreds of sub
jects. The story of Christ was to
told and it is told in the lower
windows of the Church, the three
great windows in the chancel
not being a part of the con
tinuous narration. The ''Annun
ciation" in the east nave begins the
series. It is carried on into the
east transept, and then across to the
west transept, and is ended by "Lo,
I am with you" in the west nave.
In Ihe north nave are the "An
nunciation," after Shields; "The
Flight into Egypt," after Plock-[
hurst, ami "The Ilotne at Niiz
areth," Hoffman.
The north transept contains "The
Baptism of Christ" of Gustave
Dortf; "The Sermon on the Mount"
of Hoffman; "Christ Calming the
Tempest" of Dietrich; and"The
Raising of Jairus' Daughter" of

Ho ft'm a i).
The story is
con t i 11 u e (1
on the west i
walls. In the
transept are
" The Miracle
of Loaves and
Fishes," after
Mnri 1 1 o ;
"Christ and
the Adulter
e s s," after
Ho ff m a n ;
"T he Go o(1
Shepherd,"
afterC. S.Par
ker; "Christ
in the Home

at Bethany," after Hoffman; and
"Christ in Gethsemnae," also after
Hoffman. In the nave are Gustave
Dore's "The Dream of iPilate's
Wife," Ender's "The Angel at the
Tomb," and an original by Paoletti,
" Lo, I am with you."
The upper windows contain
single figures, and nearly all of
them are the design of Frederick S.
Lamb. Old Testament celebrities
have been placed in the east wall,
New Testament characters in the
west wall. Commencing in the
east nave are found "Abraham,"
" Hagar," "Moses," "Pharaoh's
Daughter," "Joshua," "Deborah,"
" David," " Ruth," " Solomon,"
" Queen of Sheba," " Elijah,"
"Esther," "Isaiah," "Judith,''
"Daniel," and " Hannah," the last
ten situated in the east transept.
The New Testament figures, like
wise sixteen in number, are "St.
Simeon,""St. Anne," "St. Matthew,"
"Faith," "St. Mark," "Charity,"
" St. Luke," " Dorcas," " St. Paul,"
"Martha," "St. Stephen," "St.
Agnes," " St. Peter," " Priscilla,"
"St. John," and "Hope."
In token of the fact that Christ
ianity has been the most potent
power in the raising of women from
ignominy to a high spiritual, men
tal, and physical life, Mrs. Stanford
has selected many subjects in which
are the figures of women. A

woman figure is in almost every
group of the lower windows and in
more than half the windows of the
clerestory.



There are in the world many ca
thedrals and many windows and
collections of windows. These have
been made sometimes one at a time,
sometimes several. But never has
an order been given for such a large

by Fellowes-Prynne; "The Cruci
fixion," from Degger; and the
" Ascension, " from Carlotti. The
rich setting for the infant figure of
Hoffman's youthful Christ makes
the rose window a wonderful and
beautful object.
Mrs. Stanford in making her se
lections examined hundreds of sub
jects. The story of Christ was to
told and it is told in the lower
windows of the Church, the three
great windows in the chancel
not being a part of the con
tinuous narration. The ''Annun
ciation" in the east nave begins the
series. It is carried on into the
east transept, and then across to the
west transept, and is ended by "Lo,
I am with you" in the west nave.
In Ihe north nave are the "An
nunciation," after Shields; "The
Flight into Egypt," after Plock-[
hurst, ami "The Ilotne at Niiz
areth," Hoffman.
The north transept contains "The
Baptism of Christ" of Gustave
Dortf; "The Sermon on the Mount"
of Hoffman; "Christ Calming the
Tempest" of Dietrich; and"The
Raising of Jairus' Daughter" of

Ho ft'm a i).
The story is
con t i 11 u e (1
on the west i
walls. In the
transept are
" The Miracle
of Loaves and
Fishes," after
Mnri 1 1 o ;
"Christ and
the Adulter
e s s," after
Ho ff m a n ;
"T he Go o(1
Shepherd,"
afterC. S.Par
ker; "Christ
in the Home

at Bethany," after Hoffman; and
"Christ in Gethsemnae," also after
Hoffman. In the nave are Gustave
Dore's "The Dream of iPilate's
Wife," Ender's "The Angel at the
Tomb," and an original by Paoletti,
" Lo, I am with you."
The upper windows contain
single figures, and nearly all of
them are the design of Frederick S.
Lamb. Old Testament celebrities
have been placed in the east wall,
New Testament characters in the
west wall. Commencing in the
east nave are found "Abraham,"
" Hagar," "Moses," "Pharaoh's
Daughter," "Joshua," "Deborah,"
" David," " Ruth," " Solomon,"
" Queen of Sheba," " Elijah,"
"Esther," "Isaiah," "Judith,''
"Daniel," and " Hannah," the last
ten situated in the east transept.
The New Testament figures, like
wise sixteen in number, are "St.
Simeon,""St. Anne," "St. Matthew,"
"Faith," "St. Mark," "Charity,"
" St. Luke," " Dorcas," " St. Paul,"
"Martha," "St. Stephen," "St.
Agnes," " St. Peter," " Priscilla,"
"St. John," and "Hope."
In token of the fact that Christ
ianity has been the most potent
power in the raising of women from
ignominy to a high spiritual, men
tal, and physical life, Mrs. Stanford
has selected many subjects in which
are the figures of women. A

woman figure is in almost every
group of the lower windows and in
more than half the windows of the
clerestory.
