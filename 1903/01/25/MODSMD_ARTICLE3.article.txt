## " I Have Built an House of Habitation for Thee, and a Place for My Dwelling Forever.” 
### 
In spanning a continent, it is to
find the nation which fronts both
the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans
husied on each shore in the sacred
task of church building.
What Americans are doing now,
all men in every land have rejoiced
to do—triumphing in the vision
seen above this stately pile today,
the vision of (Jod and of Itnmortal
ity.
The majestic Church which we
dedicate this day to the worship of

God and to the blessed hope of
etermil life stands, the latest in a
long line of the goodly fellowship
of temples. In the far-back begin
nings of civilization man reared
his first churches. Through the
whole story of civilization he has
continued to rear his churches.
The earliest works of architecture
preserved for us are temples. The
only architectural works which
have survived the ravages of time,
in many a land, are the ruins of
the buildings man has lifted in
worship. Through successive gen
erations and centuries and millen
iums man has continued to be a
church builder. And so today we,
the heir of the ages, repeat the story
of the past, as wealth consecrates
itself to the rearing of a structure
which shall stand through ages yet
to come, a splended symbol in stone
of the faith in which man lives
nobly, the hope in which he dies
bravely and peacefully.
What a chain of impressive build
ings the churches of humanity form,
binding the whole world round the
feet of God! How they lift them
selves up from every land of earth,
in mute attestation of man's trusts
and aspirations' We think of the
monster burnt-brick pyramids of
Chaldea, of the rock-hewn temple
of Ellora, and of the great pagoda
at Tanfore in India, of the Titanic
pile at Karnacin upper Egypt, the
most impressive ruins in the world;
of the Parthenon, lifted high upon
its stern rock above Athens, of the
golden-domed, white-walled Tem
ple at Jerusaleum, of the vast
Mosque of St. Sophia in Constanti
nople, of the mighty Cologne Ca
thedral, of the charming Dnomo at
Florence, of stately St. Mark's in
Venice, of the beautiful Cathedral
at Amiens, of the august mausoleum
of the English-speaking race, West
minster Abbey.
The story of the building of these
great churches, as we know it, forms
one of the most fascinating pages

of history. There have been periods
of a veritable passion for church
building, ages in which mankind
seemed possessed with an enthus
iasm for the heroic tasks of sacred
architecture. Notable among these
periods of church-building was the
dawn of the modern era in Europe.
When the thousandth year of Chris
tendom had passed in safety and
the horrible nightmare of super
stitious fear, haunting men's minds,
as they looked forward to the com
ing of the end of the world, disap
peared, a new life of joyous hope
filled the soul of man; and in glad
gratitude he turned to the pious
labors of restoring and renewing
the churches of Europe. In France
and Germany and Italy and Eng
land new churches, more lovely
than any ever before seen in those
lands, sprang up as if by magic.
As a monk of Cluny wrote —"It
was as if the earth, rousing itself
and casting away its old robes,
clothed itself with the white gar
ment of churches."
No more inspiring tale of impas
sioned enthusiasm and unselfish
consecration of wealth has ever
been told than is found in the
records of the church-builders.
Kings poured their fortunes into the
coffers of the churches, and queens
emptied their treasure boxes at the
feet of bishops and abbotts. Prince
ly men and courtly women journey
ed from afar to the scenes of these
arduous labors, and toiled in the

unwonted tusks of the masons, that
God's house might he reared speed
ily in splendor. Free cities of
Germany and France and Jtaly
girded themselves to these tasks
with a civic pride and a communal
sacrifice which to our modern cities,
given over to the building of tem
ples to the Goddess of Getting-on,
must seem a veritable delirium of
sentiment. Into the building of
these churches the enthusiasm of
whole peoples has poured, in a beau
tiful and loftlv devotion which

alone is worthy of redeeming the
story of man from the shame of
sordidness and materiality. As
ran the decree of one of the com
munes of Italy, preparing for such
a church —"No work of the com
mune shall be undertaken unless
the design be to make it correspond
with a heart which is of the great
est nature, because composed of the
spirit of many citizens, concordant
in one single will."
How touching stories of the way
in which the communes of Italy
undertook the labor of raising
money for their immortal Duomol
With what alacrity of self-imposed
taxation did they provide, as in the
case of Florence, that it should be
"then ordered that Arnolfo, archi
tect of our commune, prepare the
model or plan for the rebuilding of
Santa Reparata with such supreme
and lofty magnificence that neither
the industry nor the capacity of
man shall be able to devise any
thing more grand or more beauti
ful." How the chosen architects
entered upon their labors let the
records show. "In 1308 Duccio
entered into agreement with the
bead of the works to paint a picture
for the high-altar of the Duomo in
Siena. It was to be the best he
could do, as the Lord should give
him grace to do it. When Brunell
sclii confronted the heroic under
taking of lifting the mighty dome
above the Duomo in Florence, with
out inner bracings to mar the effect
of the interior, a task never before
achieved, he summoned his courage
after this fashion: "Remembering
that this temple is dedicated to
God and to the Virgin, I have con
fidence that we, Betting to work in
memory of him, he will not fail to

infuse knowledge where it falls
short, and to supply strength and
wisdom and intelligence to whoso
ever may undertake the task."
There is in the records of Santa
Maria del Fiore a touch which
makes our modern world akin with
the world of the Middle Ages.
''There were always people ahout,"
says the anonymous biographer of
Brunellechi, "who made a circle,"
or in the vernacular of our day,
'a ring'and gave him much trouble."
The building of many of these

great churches of earth proved tasks
far beyond the power of one gener
ation to complete. Successive gen
erations dedicated themselves to the
labor of perfecting the original de
sign. We have 6een in our own
day more than one historic min
ster thus finished, generations
and centuries after the cornerstone
of the building was laid. Only in
our time have the mighty spires of
Cologne Cathedral crowned that
massive pile. It was my privilege
a few years ago to be in Florence
on a most interesting occasion.
The great Duomo had stood for
centuries with its mighty facade
unfinished. Under the enthusiasm
of the revival of national unity,
the restoration of national inde
pendence, Italy girded itself to the
task of building this facade. With
what of help was left from the re
cords of the past, the best talent of
Italy sought to complete the build
ing in the spirit of its founders. A
generous spirit of national cooper
ation inspired the daring labor.
Every great sculptor of Italy was
given a figure to carve for the adorn
ing of the marble front. When the
time came to behold the finished
work the nation was on the tip-toe of
expectancy. Vast crowds filled the
spaces before the Duomo. Amid
the hush of the great throng the
coverings hanging before the build
ing were removed, and, in all the
glory of the finest marble of Italy,
in the splendor of its loveliest
colors, in the beauty of its noblest
workmanship, the facade of the
old Duomo stood complete.
These glorious temples have been,
in many instances, veritable
growths of the life of great peoples
—evolving not so much out of any
one architect's plans as out of the
changing thought and feeling of
the nation. Thus in Egypt succes
sive kings added to those noble
temples, expressing in each addi
tion some new breath of religious
life, until the result is seen in a
living organism, a thing endowed
with life, the life of a whole race.
Such an organic expression of
English life is found in Westmin
ster Abbey, which is like the Con
stitution of the people, not a man
ufacture but a growth — rightly
read, revealing the history of a
race. The history of Venice for
five hundred years is indubitably
recorded on the walls of the Church
of St. Mark, the decoration of which
had been the chief task of her arte.
History preserves for us the fra
grant memory of how, when these
great churches have been complet
ed, cities and nations have kept
festal day, as in Florence a few
years ago. The quaint Chronicles
of Siena enable us still to enter into
the joyous enthusiasm with which
her citizens welcomed to their
Duomo the noble altar-piece which
bad been the work of their leading
artist.
If we had the records preserved
to us, might we picture the scenes
in upper Egypt, when the most
wonderful building of earth, the
mighty temple of Karnac, was
dedicated; or the festivities in Ath
ens when the Parthenon was com
pleted and apart to its high
purposes; or, far back in the dim,
misty vistas of antiquity, the ex
citement on the plains between the
rivers, when the ancient Arcadians
lifted high above those level plains
their massive pyramidal piles, on
the summit of which a nation's
worship was to be offered.
What a variety these great
churches of history present to us
in their types of architecture.

NY hat a contrast between the Gre
cian temple and the Gothic min
ster; between Stonehenge and West
minster Abbey; between the meet
ing-house of our New England val
leys and St. Peter's, Rome; between
the synagogues of Palestine and the
mosques of Saracenic Spain. Each
great church has represented the
genius of a people, the spirit of a
race, the temper of an age. Each
has embodied a type of mind, a
form of thought, a belief of the
soul, an aspiration of the spirit.
The almost infinite varieties of hu
man nature are typed in these va
rieties of sacred architecture. The
manifold phases of the divine na
ture gleam upon our souls through
these varying types of human na
ture.
In each of these great churches
the superficial mind can find some
thing alien to its own thought and
feeling, something to differ from, to
oppose. Little natures thus draw
aside into their own conventicles
and meeting-houses, synagogues,
mosques, and churches, and,
through the differences between
them, all alike find themselves iso
lated one from the other, with
drawn from the sacred bonds of hu
man fellowship. Deeper natures
will see in each of these great
churches, as in the types of thought
and feeling which they express,
something to admire, to sympa
thize with, to stir a sense of com
munity of life, to Unit more closely

the sacred bonds of hu
man fellowship. Each
church is by such souls
seen to stand for some
conception, however rude
or however noble, of the
human and of the di
vine nature, something
not to be lightly cast
aside, something to he
interpreted, understood,
appreciated, assimilated,
and made our own.
Thus the New Eng
land Puritan poet
stands in Chartree, at
first tempted to look
with scorn upon
the superstitious mum-

meries of the old peasant woman up
on her knees by his side,fumbling her
beads; but a deeper insight reveals to
him in her the same reverence and
awe, the same faith and hope and
love which stirs his cultivated soul.
Thus Browning reads the parable
of sympathy in religion in his won
derful poem, "Christmas Eve"; car
rying us from the close and steam
ing air of the common-place chapel
to the pageantry of St. Peter's, to
find the presence of the Christ as
our hearts beat in sympathy with
the rude service of the meeting
house and the gorgeous ritual of
the basilica, or to miss the Christ
as we turn from either unsympa
thetically.
All these great churches of his
tory stand for what is most impor
tant in human life and thought.
Each one is an expression of man's
perception of something outside o
himself, beyond himself, above himr
self, a Power "in whom we live and
move and have our being." Wher
ever a great church has lifted itself
above the plains or perched itself
upon some mountain crag, or nes
tled in some secluded valley, of
reached forth from some jutting
promontory to cast the shadow of
its cross in benediction upon the
stormful sea —there man's spiritual
nature has expressed itself in a
stone symbol, his consciousness of

his own being, his origin, his na
ture, his destiny,—his faith in God,
his assurance of immortality. So
as I spanned the continent in this
journey and turned my eyes away
from the Cathedral of St. John the
Divine, rising over the city that we
think given to sordid mammon
worship; and as, meeting the waters
of the Pacific on the other Bide of
the continent, my eyes lighted upon
this beautiful structure rising above
the plains to which men once looked
only for the gold that was hidden
beneath them; I seemed to see the
symbol of the deeper life of this
people, surely to aspire after those
fine idealisms which are dormant
within them, those spiritual ener
gies which are one day to conse
crate this material power, in an en
thusiasm of humanity that is to
make of this nation the leader in
the world's movement towards de
mocracy, a veritable democracy of
political rights, a genuine democ
racy of industrial possessions.
What a growth the story of
church-building presents us ! From
the rudest beginnings on to the
highest developments of architec
ture, we compass the whole octave
of this noble art in our study of
church-building. . . .
What a contrast between that
little meeting-house of the Puritans
in Salem, Massachusetts, the first
church building upon our shores,
still standing encased within the
walls that have been reared to pro-

tect it for posterity, the earliest
growth of religion on our shores —
what a contrast between this little
building and the mighty pile in
which we are gathered here today.
The contrast which we find in the
body of sacred architecture, the
church-building, we find in the
soul of sacred architecture, the re
iigious thought and feeling inspir
ing these creations —a growth from
the simplest beginnings of beliefs to
the noblest unfoldings of faith.
From forms of crossest and most
savage ignorance the thought of
man has grown through his history,
becoming clearer, saner, more com
manding to the reason, more satis
fying to the heart, more compelling
in its constraint over the soul. In
the worship of the Divine Being
which now finds expression in the
great temples of the modern world
we have the flowering of the pro
foundest philosophy, the purest
poetry, the exactest science of the
modern mind. . . .
The worship lifted up in man's
primitive temples, how shocking to
our moral sense today I The ven
erable priests of the German forests
with their long flowing white hair,
leading the shrinking maiden into
the center of the great stone circle,
their knives uplifted for the horri
ble act of immolation; the frantic

priests forming a cordon round the
brass figure of Moloch on the Syrian
plains, their attendants heating
drums to drown the cries of the
wretched victims slowly roasting to
death within the brazen figure;
the great temple of Mexico, with
the stone altar upon which the fair
est youth of the land was placed,
hound and garlanded, that, as the
first rim of the sun's disk rose above
the eastern horizon, his throbbing
heart might be plucked from his
body and offered as a sacrifice to
"our Lord the Sun" —how incon
ceivable to us today that these

could have been the forms in which
man ever worshipped "our Father
which art in Heaven. 1 ' From these
far hack beginnings of most incon
ceivable cruelty, these most unbe
lievable basenesses of superstition,
what a progress to the sun-lit
heights on which we stand today,
in this latest born of the temples of
man; our worship the exercise of
the mind's sanest thinking, in the
awed recognition of the Gracious
Power from which we spring, in
which we live; the trustful uplook
of our moral natures to an Infinite
and Eternal Goodness; the uplift
ing of our imagination's finest
vision in all loveliest dreams of
poetry and art concerning the in
finite beauty which is one with the
eternal truth; the outgoing of our
hearts' sacredest feeling in the glad
and joyous perception that all hu
man life is born from a Life infinite,
eternal, divine; that every human
affection is a sacrament, an outward
and visible sign of an inward and
spiritual grace or graciousness of
Divine Being; the upward soaring
of the aspirations of conscience, in
which all the moral forces of our
being surge strenuously toward the
Perfect Ideal, exigentlv calling to
us —"Be ye perfect, even as your
father which is in Heaven is per
fect!" Religion, beginning in su
perstition, is emerging into ration
ality; beginning in fear, is climbing
out into the sunned heights of calm
and trustful love; beginning in the
mummeries of ceremonialism, is
passing out into the ethical and
spiritual realities of character and
conduct. Religion is seen to be
now but another term for the highest
life, the reverent recognition and
faithful fulfillment of the relation
ships in which we are bound one to
the other, and all of us to an infi-

nite and eternal order, the beauti-|
ful order of the universe, and thus
to the Power which ensouls that
order, the indwelling God. The
religion which the great temples of
today enshrine and symbolize in
the religion of ethical and spiritual
life. Its loftiest ritual is found in
the Te Deums of aspiration, in the'
litanies of reverence, in the psalms
of trust, in the sacred hymns of
obedience to law, in the sweet can
ticles of helpfulness to our fellows, I

in the eucharistic realities of spirit
ual communion with the Divine —
in lives made "by duty epical and
rhythmic with the truth."
The great churches of earth,
seemingly so widely separated in
their architectural forms, are found
on closer study to be based upon
one common form, to represent one
type of structure, and so to en-

s h ri n e and
symbolize one
common type
of thought
and life with
in the struc
ture. Th e
body and soul
of sacredarch
itecture alike
reveal the
truth that,
below all var
ieties of our
earthly tem
ples and of
the religion
incarnate in
them, there is
a unity of
ethical and

spiritual religion, a somewhat
common to all, though found
in different developments, and
in manifold varieties. The
great temples of earth, of well
nigh every religion, are constructed
upon one ground plan. That ground
plan is cruciform. As you behold
it here today, you can trace it,
more or less clearly, in the churches
and temples of England and France,
of Germany and Russia, of Syria
and Egypt, of India and China and
Japan. . . .
How illuminatingly significant
such a fact! Below the varieties,
so contradictory and repellant, of
our sectarian Christianity, there is,

in Dean Stanley's noble phrase, a
"common Christianity"—a some
what of faith and hope common to
every sect and every denomination,
underlying every confession of faith,
within every creed, hack of every
system of thought. Every sect of
Christianity holds by the faith in
God, the faith in immortality, the
faith in the spiritual mastership
and leadership of Jesus, the Christ
of God. The conduits are different,
the spring and fountain is one.

So, if we may coin a nobler
phrase than that of Dean Stanley
there is a "common humanity" in
religion. There is a somewhat
common to all religions, no matter
how alien or contradictory each to
the others may seem. Each holds
somewhat that is held by the others,
and that which it holds in common
with the others is the inmost, vital,

essential faith of all. There is a
oneness of ethical and ispiritual re
ligion in which Christian, Moham
medan, Jew, Hindu, Japanese,
Chinaman, all alike stand confess
edly the children of one Father.
With the Persian mystic we too
may each say —"I am at home in
mosque or synagogue, in temple or
in church."
These great churches which man
has reared on earth have minister
ed to all noblest forms of life. They
have heen the of art and
poetry and music. Architeclure
lias found its noblest inspiration in
the endeavor to rear worthy of
God. To paint an altar-piece for
some great Duomo, was the highest
ambition of the noblest painter. To
fill those great ministers of the
Middle Ages with the dim, religious
light in which all the prose of earth
was transformed into the poetry of
heaven, was the inspiration out of
which grew the art of the stained
glass window. Modern music was
born on the steps of the altar. The
music of Christendom began in the
chanting of the Psalter and in the
rendering of the Mass. Palestrina
was the forefather of Beethoven
and Wagner. Poetry's lips were
touched with the live coal from off
the altar. These great churches of
man have thus been the nursing
mothers of the aesthetic life of man.
Into the worship of the great
churches of earth every art has
been drawn, as the handmaiden of
religion, and consecrated to the
service of the Most High. The
service of the Holy Communion,
the central act in all Christian
churches, leads up into the Mass of
the Church of Rome, as the loftiest
expression of the artistic life of man.
It is the dramatization of re
ligion.
Were there time I might point
out how the great churches of
earth have ministered to the intel
lectual life of man—in the preach
ing of Athanasius, Augustine, Lu
ther, Calvin, John Knox, South,
Bossnet, Jonathan Edwards, Chan
ny and Brooks.
The noblest of all forms of life
has been most nobly ministered
unto in these noble churches of
earth Far above the aesthetic life
of man, which finds expression in
the arts —in poetry, in painting,
in sculpture, in architecture, in
music; high even above the intel
lectual life of man, which finds ex


pression in his philosophies and
sciences, is the moral and spiritual
life of man, which finds expression
in character and conduct. This
is the crown and consummation of
our human life. . . . And this
moral and spiritual life of man has
been fed supremely by the churches
of earth. For this they have been
consciously or unconsciously called
into existence. . . . To awaken
his faith, to rouse and quicken his
hope, to sweeten the emotions of
his heart until they shall burgeon
and blossom in all loveliest forms
of charity, to educate his conscience,
to nerve his will, to strengthen him
in the battle of life, to bind him
under the sweet influences of the
heavenly worlds shining upon his
soul in the stilly silences of the
Spirit, to Hash upon him the gleam
from out the darkness, in the fol
lowing of which iB the true joy
and felicity of life —this has been
the ministry of the churches of
earth. Into them men have pour
ed in their hours of weakness to
gain strength, in their hours of
doubt to gain certitude, and in their
hours of sorrow to gain comfort.
. . . Our whole human life,
in its cycling round of relationships
and responsibilities, has been led
within the great temple for consecra
tion. . . . The individual, in
all his relationships and responsi
bilities, has been breathed upon in
the great Church for the tasks and
struggles of life, and sent out to
quit himself like a man.
These great churches have been
more than the centers of individual
inspiration; they have, in the great
ages of religion, been the centers of
civic and national life. In them all
rank has been forgotten, all classes
have commingled, as the rich and
the poor, the nobles and peasants,
the king and the serf have bowed
together in the democracy of relig
ion. ... In its cathedral the
communeof thefree towns of France
and Germany and Italy found its
forum, and within the sacred walls
in tumultuous assemblies, the crises
of a city's destiny have been met,
as men have looked "to the hills
from whence cometh our help."
We may no longer come to
our great ministers for our civic as
semblies, but from our great minis
ters is still streaming the tides of
moral energy, of the sacred enthus
iasm of humanity, which, moving
through our western democracy,
are making for all that is best and
noblest in our national life. The
inspiration of our cities for the
great task of our generation—civic
regeneration—is found today in our
churches. . . . The casting of
the ballot is only the registering of
the decrees issued by the will of the
community. The real election of
the people is made within the sa
cred chambers of conscience—the
true shrine of the indwelling God.
It may seem to some of you as
though the day of the church were
passing. In one sense it is well
that so it should be. The aim of
every human institution is to make
itself unnecessary. An institution
fulfills its own end in dispensing
with itself. It exists that it may
train men to do without it. The
family rears children that it may
send them forth to live and love,
even though the home be broken
up. The state exists that it may
surround immature men with the
restraints of law, in order that the
time may come when the law writ
ten without, in codes and statutes,
shall be found written on inner
fleshly tablets, and the vision of the
Jewish prophet shall come true

"I will write my laws in their
hearts" So the external law, with
its prohibitions and penalties, may
disappear when the internal law,in
the majesty of the true divine au
thority, takes the throne of man's
being. The university exists, not
that its students may forever be
pupils, sitting at the feet of masters,
but that they may so learn there
from the masters, in all human
wisdom, that on leaving the univer
sity, its cloisters, its halls, its libra-

ries and museums, they may go
forth as trained and educated men
and women, masters of their own
powers, having learned the great
secret of all wisdom —"Know thy
self." The Christian seer saw the
New Jerusalem coming down out
of heaven upon earth, the llower of
the ideal society, the kingdom of
God, the republic of man. And he
writes —"I saw no temple therein."
No temple in the perfect city? Not
because there was to be no religion
there,but because there was to be in
all things therein the true religion.
Because every human relationship
in the perfected life of earth shall
flower into forms that are indistin
guishable from religion. Because
in the good time coming the cap
tains of industry shall lead every
private in the economic army in
the ways of peace and prosperity,
as coming not selfishly to be minis
tered unto, but unselfishly to minis
ter in the service of God, which is
the service of man. Because sci
ence, kindling in the soul of man
the vision of the universal reign of
law, shall so reveal that mystery of
the beautiful order that men shall
see that "conscious law is king of
kings," shall understand that sym
bol of the ancient Jewish temple

which, leading the wor
ship from the outer courts
into the Holy Place and
through them both into
the Most Holy Shekinah,
revealed there simply the
stone tables of the Law—
that Moral Law which is
at the heart of the uni
verse, the heart of God
who is our ' Righteous
Father,' 'The Eternal
who loveth rightousness.'
Because men shall so
build and carve and sing
and paint and work in

every legitimate and noble exer
cise of their human powers and
faculties that life, mounting in
the joy of action, shall with the
birds of the air and the trees
of the field, join in endless Alle
lujas to Him 'in whom we live
and move and have our being.'
'Know ye not that your bodies are
the temples of the Holy Ghost?'
As the Jewish sage wrote —''When
I lay my hand upon the human
body I lay it upon the Shekinah

of God." "I saw no temple there
in," —outward pile of marble,
glorious in all noble forms, lustrous
in all radiant colors, resounding
with all noble triumph of song —
because in the temple had been
formed and fashioned the men and
women who were to be the true
housings of God —as the line French
phrase for the cathedral runs —
"Le logeur du bon Dieu"; —their
bodies sanctified in all the pure
vitality of health, their minds il
lumined in all the high power of
knowledge, their hearts devoted in
all the sweet energies of affection,
their whole beings made fit taber
nacles of the indwelling God. "The
word was made flesh and taber
nacled among us." There was the
true temple of the true God. That
you and I may be made men and
women in whom the Eternal Word
may tabernacle—this is the end
and aim of every great church, in
the accomplishing of which the
time may come when the poet's
vision shall prove true —"I saw no
temple therein." . . .
Such are some of the thoughts
that come to us, as we gather here
today to dedicate the latest in the
long line of the great churches
which man has reared to the glory

of God, in the vision of the life to
come.
This noble building which is
opened today, a decade after the
founding of the University, is no
mere afterthought,—it is an inte
gral part of the original plan of the
Founders.
It was clearly recognized by them
that education must be more than
the winning of knowledge; that it
must be knowledge led on into wis
dom, "the beginning" of which, as
the Hebrew seer long ago pointed
out, is "the fear of the Lord"; that
mental life must rise into moral
life, and moral life into religious
iife, if it is to be "more life and
fuller that we want"; that the man
hood to be trained must be a whole
manhood —body, mind, and soul;
that culture must ripen into char
acter, the character which runs its
deepest roots down into the
reverent recognition of God,
the calm and fearless vision
through "the grave and gate of
death" into immortality.
So it was planned that the Uni
versity chapel should be reared
where it now stands, the keystone
of the whole group of beautiful
buildings, binding all the depart
ments of a true education into a
living unity, ethical and spiritual,
fashioning manhood into the fine
fiber of faith; its pulpit interpret
ing all knowledge into terms of
life; on its altar the full life here
grown burgeoning and blossoming
into the loftiest experience of our
human nature, —worship. Natural,
this, for a University with such a
history.
Born out of a deep sorrow, out of
a deep sorrow transformed into the
holiest and divinest of all joys;
born out of the faith, made living
and real, that there is no death,
that the life uprooted from earth
is but transplanted into the
skies, and that the child in whom
the home centered is still the cen
ter of the home, —this University is
thus born of the very spirit of re
ligion.
From the beginning, a temporary
chapel has ministered to the moral
and religious life of the University,
giving place indue time to this
sacred shrine of the soul; a cathe
dral church rising to be the symbol
in stone of the supremacy of the
spiritual life, —all the noblest arts
uniting to make it ministrant upon
the noblest life of man.
In the large and luminous plan
ning of the Founders of the Uni
versity, it was decided that its
Church should minister to the
spiritual life of the University after
a fashion worthy of a university.
The charter ordered that the Church
should be forever free from any ec
clesiastical relationships; that the
teachings from its pulpit should be
non-sectarian; and that the worship
should be such that in it all might
freely unite. This provision com
mands the unhesitating acquies
cence of those who are now placed
in charge of the Church. What


ever their ecclesiastical relation
ships have been in the past, and
whatever those relationships may
be in the future, should they here
after turn from this ministry to re
sume their old denominational
ministries, while they are here they
will be faithful to this chartered
requirement; glad to have part in
the fashioning of a church which
shall escape the provincialisms of
piety, and be as catholic as Chris
tianity, as large as humanity.
And this, not because they love less
their own household of faith, but
because they love more that Church
of God which their Prayer-book, in
its supreme office of worship, calls
"the blessed company of all faith
ful people." Such a catholic
Christianity alone can be the wor
thy expression of the religious life
of a university.
The pulpit of this Church is to
try to find the common denomina
tor of our manifold forms of Chris
tianity. It is to present those es
sential, ethical, and spiritual
truths which are the heritage of all
who bear the name of "Christian,"
—which we are now discerning to
be the heritage of all who bear the
human name, aschildren of the one
All Father, the sons and daugh
ters of God in every race, in whom
"shineth the light which lighteth
every man that cometh into the
world."
The worship of this Church is to
find, as far as possible, an expres
sion, on the one hand, for the desire
which has fashioned liturgical ser
vices—the craving for dignity and
beauty in worship; and, on the
other hand, for the desire which
has manifested itself in non-litur
gical services, the longing for sim
plicity and spirituality in worship.
In lifting up our worship we are to
depend largely upon the ministry
of music—"holy music," as Wag
ner called it; that music which Sid
ney Lanier called "Love in search
of a word." . . . The ideal wor
ship of this cathedral Church,
toward which we are slowly to
grow, should embody the genius of
the University itself. This can be
attained only when the spiritual
life of the University shall come to
self-consciousness.
The celebration of the sacrament
of the Lord's Supper, the central
rite of the Christian church, will,
at present, follow the form ordained
in the Protestant Episcopal Church
—the historic form of this service
among English-speaking peoples,
the type on which all Protestant
varieties of the rite are patterned;
but the utmost simplicity will be
observed in the use of this ser
vice, and to the holy table all
will be welcomed who "love our
Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and
truth."
All souls within the University
should find their spiritual home
here, and to this end must be made
to feel at home herein. A sign
and symbol of this largeness of the
University Church we have before
our eyes this morning — a service
participated in by ministers of
various denominations of Protest
ant Christianity, and by a rep
resentative of the Mother Church
of Christendom — the Jewish
Church.
The original plan of a University
Church has been carried out by the
surviving Founder as a sacred mis
sion from God, with what toil of
thought, with what patience of
preparation, with what measureless
munificence I And now at length,

love's labor done, the cathedral
Church stands complete; massive,
nobly proportioned, rich in every
possible adornment of art —lovely
windows, beautiful mural paint
ings, glorious mosaics, stately
sculptures; to furnish which
our the best talent of own
country has been impressed
into service, and the artistic treas
ures of the old world have been
reproduced with utmost care.
That art here is ministrant to the
religious life is attested by the
hush of reverence which every
one feels on entering within these
walls.
So well has the sacred story been
woven into the warp and woof of
this structure that, if its pulpit
found no voice, these walls would
tell to successive generations the
"glad tidings of great joy." Ilus
kin said of a famous French cathe
dral that it was"the Bible of
Amiens." This noble Church may
well be called the Bible of the
Santa Clara Valley.
In carrying out the original plan
for a University Church, the surviv
ing Founder has made the structure
a memorial to one who passed
away from earth before his eyes
were gladdened by the sight of this
beautiful building. It enshrines
forever the memory of the great
War Governor, the patriotic Sena
tor, the audacious planner of
a transcontinental railway, the
strong-brained man, upright in
business, just in every social rela
tionship, kindly as a neighbor, ten
der as a husband and father, learn
ing from his angel boy to "live for
humanity," to die as a simple
souled Christian. May his spirit
in the unseen world rejoice today
with us in this his worthy memo
rial !
So, today, we set apart this
building from all common and sec
ular uses to the sacred services of
the great churches of all lands, of
all ages, for men and women
through the long years that are to
come. Here, where the flower of
the State, of the great West, per
haps of the mighty Nation itself,
nay, even of the far-off lands of the
East, shall be drawn through the
coming generations, to win culture,
to train in power, to become fitted
for life's work—here forever this
Memorial Church shall stand as
sign and symbol of the true end
and aim of education, the fashion
ing of a noble manhood and
womanhood, made ready for the
tabernacling of the indwelling God,
with all human powers consecrated
to the service of humanity. We
who now dedicate this building to
these high uses will have passed
away ere long, our work, let us
humbly hope, well done; but in the
generations and centuries that are
to follow, others will come hither
to worship, to renew their faith and
hope and love, to find inspiration
for all noble living, to win the
"power to become the sons of God":
the men and women in whom all
earthly knowledge and wisdom
shall be offered upon the altar of
sacrifice, and the service of their
fellows shall prove the worship of
their God.
As the near and the far-off gen
erations shall gather within these
walls, may the faith in God and
the hope of eternal life kindle anew
in myriads of souls through Him
in whom this faith and hope have
mirrored themselves forever clearly
in the spirit of man —Jesus, the
Christ, our Lord!
