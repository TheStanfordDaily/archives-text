# SERMON BY REV. R. HEBER NEWTON.
## " I Have Built an House of Habitation for Thee, and a Place for My Dwelling Forever.”

In spanning a continent, it is to
find the nation which fronts both
the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans
husied on each shore in the sacred
task of church building.
What Americans are doing now,
all men in every land have rejoiced
to do—triumphing in the vision
seen above this stately pile today,
the vision of (Jod and of Itnmortal
ity.
The majestic Church which we
dedicate this day to the worship of

God and to the blessed hope of
etermil life stands, the latest in a
long line of the goodly fellowship
of temples. In the far-back begin
nings of civilization man reared
his first churches. Through the
whole story of civilization he has
continued to rear his churches.
The earliest works of architecture
preserved for us are temples. The
only architectural works which
have survived the ravages of time,
in many a land, are the ruins of
the buildings man has lifted in
worship. Through successive gen
erations and centuries and millen
iums man has continued to be a
church builder. And so today we,
the heir of the ages, repeat the story
of the past, as wealth consecrates
itself to the rearing of a structure
which shall stand through ages yet
to come, a splended symbol in stone
of the faith in which man lives
nobly, the hope in which he dies
bravely and peacefully.
What a chain of impressive build
ings the churches of humanity form,
binding the whole world round the
feet of God! How they lift them
selves up from every land of earth,
in mute attestation of man's trusts
and aspirations' We think of the
monster burnt-brick pyramids of
Chaldea, of the rock-hewn temple
of Ellora, and of the great pagoda
at Tanfore in India, of the Titanic
pile at Karnacin upper Egypt, the
most impressive ruins in the world;
of the Parthenon, lifted high upon
its stern rock above Athens, of the
golden-domed, white-walled Tem
ple at Jerusaleum, of the vast
Mosque of St. Sophia in Constanti
nople, of the mighty Cologne Ca
thedral, of the charming Dnomo at
Florence, of stately St. Mark's in
Venice, of the beautiful Cathedral
at Amiens, of the august mausoleum
of the English-speaking race, West
minster Abbey.
The story of the building of these
great churches, as we know it, forms
one of the most fascinating pages

of history. There have been periods
of a veritable passion for church
building, ages in which mankind
seemed possessed with an enthus
iasm for the heroic tasks of sacred
architecture. Notable among these
periods of church-building was the
dawn of the modern era in Europe.
When the thousandth year of Chris
tendom had passed in safety and
the horrible nightmare of super
stitious fear, haunting men's minds,
as they looked forward to the com
ing of the end of the world, disap
peared, a new life of joyous hope
filled the soul of man; and in glad
gratitude he turned to the pious
labors of restoring and renewing
the churches of Europe. In France
and Germany and Italy and Eng
land new churches, more lovely
than any ever before seen in those
lands, sprang up as if by magic.
As a monk of Cluny wrote —"It
was as if the earth, rousing itself
and casting away its old robes,
clothed itself with the white gar
ment of churches."
No more inspiring tale of impas
sioned enthusiasm and unselfish
consecration of wealth has ever
been told than is found in the
records of the church-builders.
Kings poured their fortunes into the
coffers of the churches, and queens
emptied their treasure boxes at the
feet of bishops and abbotts. Prince
ly men and courtly women journey
ed from afar to the scenes of these
arduous labors, and toiled in the

unwonted tusks of the masons, that
God's house might he reared speed
ily in splendor. Free cities of
Germany and France and Jtaly
girded themselves to these tasks
with a civic pride and a communal
sacrifice which to our modern cities,
given over to the building of tem
ples to the Goddess of Getting-on,
must seem a veritable delirium of
sentiment. Into the building of
these churches the enthusiasm of
whole peoples has poured, in a beau
tiful and loftlv devotion which

alone is worthy of redeeming the
story of man from the shame of
sordidness and materiality. As
ran the decree of one of the com
munes of Italy, preparing for such
a church —"No work of the com
mune shall be undertaken unless
the design be to make it correspond
with a heart which is of the great
est nature, because composed of the
spirit of many citizens, concordant
in one single will."
How touching stories of the way
in which the communes of Italy
undertook the labor of raising
money for their immortal Duomol
With what alacrity of self-imposed
taxation did they provide, as in the
case of Florence, that it should be
"then ordered that Arnolfo, archi
tect of our commune, prepare the
model or plan for the rebuilding of
Santa Reparata with such supreme
and lofty magnificence that neither
the industry nor the capacity of
man shall be able to devise any
thing more grand or more beauti
ful." How the chosen architects
entered upon their labors let the
records show. "In 1308 Duccio
entered into agreement with the
bead of the works to paint a picture
for the high-altar of the Duomo in
Siena. It was to be the best he
could do, as the Lord should give
him grace to do it. When Brunell
sclii confronted the heroic under
taking of lifting the mighty dome
above the Duomo in Florence, with
out inner bracings to mar the effect
of the interior, a task never before
achieved, he summoned his courage
after this fashion: "Remembering
that this temple is dedicated to
God and to the Virgin, I have con
fidence that we, Betting to work in
memory of him, he will not fail to

infuse knowledge where it falls
short, and to supply strength and
wisdom and intelligence to whoso
ever may undertake the task."
There is in the records of Santa
Maria del Fiore a touch which
makes our modern world akin with
the world of the Middle Ages.
''There were always people ahout,"
says the anonymous biographer of
Brunellechi, "who made a circle,"
or in the vernacular of our day,
'a ring'and gave him much trouble."
The building of many of these

great churches of earth proved tasks
far beyond the power of one gener
ation to complete. Successive gen
erations dedicated themselves to the
labor of perfecting the original de
sign. We have 6een in our own
day more than one historic min
ster thus finished, generations
and centuries after the cornerstone
of the building was laid. Only in
our time have the mighty spires of
Cologne Cathedral crowned that
massive pile. It was my privilege
a few years ago to be in Florence
on a most interesting occasion.
The great Duomo had stood for
centuries with its mighty facade
unfinished. Under the enthusiasm
of the revival of national unity,
the restoration of national inde
pendence, Italy girded itself to the
task of building this facade. With
what of help was left from the re
cords of the past, the best talent of
Italy sought to complete the build
ing in the spirit of its founders. A
generous spirit of national cooper
ation inspired the daring labor.
Every great sculptor of Italy was
given a figure to carve for the adorn
ing of the marble front. When the
time came to behold the finished
work the nation was on the tip-toe of
expectancy. Vast crowds filled the
spaces before the Duomo. Amid
the hush of the great throng the
coverings hanging before the build
ing were removed, and, in all the
glory of the finest marble of Italy,
in the splendor of its loveliest
colors, in the beauty of its noblest
workmanship, the facade of the
old Duomo stood complete.
These glorious temples have been,
in many instances, veritable
growths of the life of great peoples
—evolving not so much out of any
one architect's plans as out of the
changing thought and feeling of
the nation. Thus in Egypt succes
sive kings added to those noble
temples, expressing in each addi
tion some new breath of religious
life, until the result is seen in a
living organism, a thing endowed
with life, the life of a whole race.
Such an organic expression of
English life is found in Westmin
ster Abbey, which is like the Con
stitution of the people, not a man
ufacture but a growth — rightly
read, revealing the history of a
race. The history of Venice for
five hundred years is indubitably
recorded on the walls of the Church
of St. Mark, the decoration of which
had been the chief task of her arte.
History preserves for us the fra
grant memory of how, when these
great churches have been complet
ed, cities and nations have kept
festal day, as in Florence a few
years ago. The quaint Chronicles
of Siena enable us still to enter into
the joyous enthusiasm with which
her citizens welcomed to their
Duomo the noble altar-piece which
bad been the work of their leading
artist.
If we had the records preserved
to us, might we picture the scenes
in upper Egypt, when the most
wonderful building of earth, the
mighty temple of Karnac, was
dedicated; or the festivities in Ath
ens when the Parthenon was com
pleted and apart to its high
purposes; or, far back in the dim,
misty vistas of antiquity, the ex
citement on the plains between the
rivers, when the ancient Arcadians
lifted high above those level plains
their massive pyramidal piles, on
the summit of which a nation's
worship was to be offered.
What a variety these great
churches of history present to us
in their types of architecture.
