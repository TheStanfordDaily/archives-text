# AFTERNOON ADDRESS.
## Rev. D. Charles Gardner Discusses the Policy and Purpose in Establishment of Memorial Church. 
### 
Today we set apart this sacred
building to the glory of God and
the uses of religion. The cathedral
churches of the Old World stand as
enduring monuments to the re
ligious zeal of men; this cathedral
like Church will stand forever a
monument to the piety of a woman.
The occasion is one of deep sig
nificance, for here today begins an

experiment freighted in its results
with tremendous possibilities for
the cause of religion in its relation
to education.
In ancient days, schools and col
leges were added to the church, for
the church was then the teacher.
Here the old order changeth, yield
ing place to new; a Church is added
to a University.
But this is no afterthought; it is
the consummation of a plan. Stan
ford University rests upon a re
ligious foundation. Its charter de
clares the existence of an all-wise
and beneficent Creator; and that
obedience to his laws is the highest
duty of man. The University was
by the Founders designed for the
benefit of mankind, not only in
tellectually, physically, and mater
ially. Provision having been made
for the physical and intellectual
welfare of the members of the Uni
versity, provision is now made for
their moral and spiritual develop
ment. The Founders believed that
man is a moral and spiritual being.
And taking the record of history
as an expression of human experi
ence, they recognized that the hu
man soul yearns for something be
yond itself, something beyond the
learning of the schools, something
more than the world can offer,
something which shall link man to
the spiritual and the divine.
Here, in the inauguration of this
work, is the recognition of religion
as a principle in the culture and
education of men.
And, by and by, must come, to
make the University complete, an
academic department for the criti
cal study of biblical literature and
history, and the general science and
history of religion. For the pres
ent this Church has been added to
the University to conserve a prin
ciple which was a definite part of
the Founders' plan.
Religion is to be taught, not
casually and without proper place,
but daily and as a necessary, vital
part of the life of the University.
The sons and daughters of the
future, whencesoever they may
come, shall find here taught, not

only science and philosophy, the
lore of classic days, and the riches
and the knowledge of the present,
but also the fundamental princi
ples of religion. Not religion in
any narrow or sectarian sense, but
Christ's religion: faith, hope, and
love; the great uplifting doctrine of
the Fatherhood of God; the revela
tion of God in Jesus Christ; the
purifying, ennobling principle of
Bonship; the fact of human Brother
hood.
And Christian morality will be
taught, not a mere "pale scheme of
ethics," but morality grounded in
the law of God, and finding its mo
tive for obedience in love and holy
fear. And here, God willing, we
shall learn to worship as sons of
God, with hearts of thankfulness,
praising the Creator in spirit and
in truth.
My brethren: This Memorial
Church, erected by the surviving
Founder of the University, is a
recognition of man's spirituality
and man's high destiny. If i ny
motto were needed beyond the
symbolism and teaching visible all
about you to convey the meaning
of its message, it would be this:
"Behold what manner of love the
Father hath bestowed upon us that
we should be called the sons of
God, and such we are."
Here by the western shore of the
New World,the theater of the drama
of the future, we begin today a
unique experiment. No less an ex
periment than this: To test whether
a non-sectarian Church can minis
ter to the spiritual needs of a great
University. We may not enlarge
upon this, except to say that while
bound by no sectarian tie, us
ing no sectarian creed, or book, or
polity, this Church is linked

through her ministry and her sac
raments to historic Christianity.
While the services will follow no
particular liturgy, they will em
brace the great historic principles
of worship, interpreting, we trust,
the religious genius of the Univer
sity.
To these principles and to this
work we solemnly dedicate, we con
secrate, we set apart this Memorial
Church. It has been built in love.
Not to teach a theological system,
not to develop a sect; but to minis
ter to the higher life of the Uni
versity. I believe you will learn
to esteem it very highly in love for
its work's sake.

And on this solemn, hietoric oc
casion I ask your prayers. First,
for her who built and gave it to
us —that God may bless and com
fort and sustain her; for those who
minister —that they may have
grace and wisdom; for those who
come within the circle of its in
fluence —that they may learn the
truth; that they may find in Chris
tian worship and Christian work
the meaning of Christian fellow
ship; that here they may win
courage to overcome temptation,
inspiration to look upward, patience
and strength to press forward to
the mark of their high calling as
Christian men and women charged
with the world's work.

ligious zeal of men; this cathedral
like Church will stand forever a
monument to the piety of a woman.
The occasion is one of deep sig
nificance, for here today begins an

experiment freighted in its results
with tremendous possibilities for
the cause of religion in its relation
to education.
In ancient days, schools and col
leges were added to the church, for
the church was then the teacher.
Here the old order changeth, yield
ing place to new; a Church is added
to a University.
But this is no afterthought; it is
the consummation of a plan. Stan
ford University rests upon a re
ligious foundation. Its charter de
clares the existence of an all-wise
and beneficent Creator; and that
obedience to his laws is the highest
duty of man. The University was
by the Founders designed for the
benefit of mankind, not only in
tellectually, physically, and mater
ially. Provision having been made
for the physical and intellectual
welfare of the members of the Uni
versity, provision is now made for
their moral and spiritual develop
ment. The Founders believed that
man is a moral and spiritual being.
And taking the record of history
as an expression of human experi
ence, they recognized that the hu
man soul yearns for something be
yond itself, something beyond the
learning of the schools, something
more than the world can offer,
something which shall link man to
the spiritual and the divine.
Here, in the inauguration of this
work, is the recognition of religion
as a principle in the culture and
education of men.
And, by and by, must come, to
make the University complete, an
academic department for the criti
cal study of biblical literature and
history, and the general science and
history of religion. For the pres
ent this Church has been added to
the University to conserve a prin
ciple which was a definite part of
the Founders' plan.
Religion is to be taught, not
casually and without proper place,
but daily and as a necessary, vital
part of the life of the University.
The sons and daughters of the
future, whencesoever they may
come, shall find here taught, not

only science and philosophy, the
lore of classic days, and the riches
and the knowledge of the present,
but also the fundamental princi
ples of religion. Not religion in
any narrow or sectarian sense, but
Christ's religion: faith, hope, and
love; the great uplifting doctrine of
the Fatherhood of God; the revela
tion of God in Jesus Christ; the
purifying, ennobling principle of
Bonship; the fact of human Brother
hood.
And Christian morality will be
taught, not a mere "pale scheme of
ethics," but morality grounded in
the law of God, and finding its mo
tive for obedience in love and holy
fear. And here, God willing, we
shall learn to worship as sons of
God, with hearts of thankfulness,
praising the Creator in spirit and
in truth.
My brethren: This Memorial
Church, erected by the surviving
Founder of the University, is a
recognition of man's spirituality
and man's high destiny. If i ny
motto were needed beyond the
symbolism and teaching visible all
about you to convey the meaning
of its message, it would be this:
"Behold what manner of love the
Father hath bestowed upon us that
we should be called the sons of
God, and such we are."
Here by the western shore of the
New World,the theater of the drama
of the future, we begin today a
unique experiment. No less an ex
periment than this: To test whether
a non-sectarian Church can minis
ter to the spiritual needs of a great
University. We may not enlarge
upon this, except to say that while
bound by no sectarian tie, us
ing no sectarian creed, or book, or
polity, this Church is linked

through her ministry and her sac
raments to historic Christianity.
While the services will follow no
particular liturgy, they will em
brace the great historic principles
of worship, interpreting, we trust,
the religious genius of the Univer
sity.
To these principles and to this
work we solemnly dedicate, we con
secrate, we set apart this Memorial
Church. It has been built in love.
Not to teach a theological system,
not to develop a sect; but to minis
ter to the higher life of the Uni
versity. I believe you will learn
to esteem it very highly in love for
its work's sake.

And on this solemn, hietoric oc
casion I ask your prayers. First,
for her who built and gave it to
us —that God may bless and com
fort and sustain her; for those who
minister —that they may have
grace and wisdom; for those who
come within the circle of its in
fluence —that they may learn the
truth; that they may find in Chris
tian worship and Christian work
the meaning of Christian fellow
ship; that here they may win
courage to overcome temptation,
inspiration to look upward, patience
and strength to press forward to
the mark of their high calling as
Christian men and women charged
with the world's work.
