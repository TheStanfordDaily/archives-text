We rejoice that the surviving
Founder has possessed the energy
and perseverence to finish the work
planned by the two. This day
there is dedicated "to the glory of
God and the uses of religion" a
building such as no other univer
sity in America can boast of. Gen
eration after generation of students
will arrive on the campus, im
bibe large draughts of the Stanford
spirit, and go forth into the world,
men and women better able to see
things, hear things, and do things.
From this time forth Memorial
Church will play a part in the
strengthening of the Stanford spirit,
and through it men and women
will be able to see things, hear
things, and do things more nobly,
more patriotically, more effectively
than hitherto.
Today is publicly inaugurated
an experiment such as has never
before been tried on an extensive
scale. The spiritual needs of the
community will be administered to
through a non-sectarian church.
There will be no creed, no bishop
ric, no polity, no ecclesiastical or
dinances or diocese. There will be
nothing out of keeping with Stan
ford life and aims. The surviving
Founder has done her part; she
has built a place for worship and
spiritual growth, and has brought
among us men who will guide and
teach. It remains for Stanford
men and women of today and of
the future to make successful this
new experiment in the teaching of
spiritual things.
