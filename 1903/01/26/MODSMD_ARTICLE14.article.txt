The class of '95 came together
Saturday night and added the
missing link to the chain of class
plates in front of Memorial Church.
The Pioneers are to be commended
on this latest evidence of their
loyal Stanford spirit. Aside from
the service the event of Sat
urday night occupied in strength
ening the close bond of friendship
that is a feature of the make-up of
this first class, the laying of the
Ninety-five plate will be, in a sense,
a kind of palliation for the univer
sal regret at the removal of the
historic '95 Oak. The presence of
the plate in the quadrangle will
remove the prevalent misunder
standing among visitors that
the 1906 class was the first to be
graduated. There is something
particularly touching in a reunion
such as that held by the Pioneers,
a sentiment which we as under
graduates cannot fully appreciate.
In it we can see a loyalty to Stan
ford, loyalty to their class, which
they point to with just pride.
