delegations as such have held.
There were present twenty-three
delegates from the State Univer
sity, twenty-three from the State
Normal, seven from California Col
lege, sixteen from the University of

escorted to the chapel. The con
ference began with song, after
which Miss Harriet Brown, '01,
general secretary for California
and Nevada, welcomed the visitors.
Miss Theresa Wilbur, president
of the Stanford Association, then
spoke on ''Bible Study,'' discussing
the practical questions of the work,
its objects and methods. MiHS Mary
Bentley, secretary of the Associa
tion atthe University of California,
spoke on "The Missionary Out
look," calling attention to our
national responsibility to the
heathen, and our personal share in
such responsibility. Lloyd Hurter,

unteers, discussed its origin and
work.
Miss Mary Page, president of the
Berkeley Association, opened the
second half of the program, speak
ing on "Our Devotional Meetings,"
their attendant problems, and the
solution of their difficulties. A
general discussion followed, the
various delegations, as called upon,
commenting briefly upon the sug
gestions of the preceding paper.
Miss Nellie Conner of San Jose
spoke on "Preparation forCapitola,
1903." Another discussion by del
egates followed this paper, and the
meeting was then adjourned to the
women's rest-room, where a com
mittee under Miss Gertrude Smith,
'04, and Mrs. Dr. Little had pre
pared tables, with fruit and coffee.
The room was decorated and offered

speakers.
