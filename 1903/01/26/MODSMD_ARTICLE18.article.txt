# THE
						PIONEER PLATE.
## The
						Class of '95 Return and Place Their Numerals in the Arcade. 
### 
Saturday night the Pioneers
were back upon the campus, a dele
gation of about twenty-five of them.
Judging from their visit, they have
not lost that spirit of enthusiastic
originality which made their col
lege life memorial and planted the
fame of the Pioneers. The object
of their coming yesterday was to
lay a plate in the chain of class
numerals that stretches along the
arcade from the doors of Memorial
Church. The Class of' 96 inaugur
ated what has become an annual
custom, each commencement add
ing another numeral to the line of
metal in the arcade walk. The
Pioneers, recognizing that they had
overlooked a tradition well worth
making, started at once to raise
money to fittingly represent them
selves, but their initiative was
weakened by distances and chilled
by recent contact with the "cold,
cold world'' and the result was a
half-sufficient fund which for six
years lay dormant in a city bank
until some weeks ago Dennis
Searles waked it from its long sleep
and secured sufficient reinforcement
to buy the needed plate.
The eve of the dedication of the
Memorial Church presented itself
as a fitting time for the laying of
the Pioneer plate. Now, memories
are strong in the Pioneer breast,
and it was decided to hold these
services in the peculiar style which
in other days had taught the com
munity to look for something un
expected with the dawn of every
day. Therefore,instead of the con
ventional daylight exercises that
have been held over the seven other
plates now in place, '95 held hers
after dark, without public an
nouncement or alien witnesses. In
the fall of '91, the class numeral
had been drawn in surreptitious
white paint upon the asphalt before
the church site, under cover of a
moonless night; with little more
publicity than attended this pre
historic ritual, the class substituted
for the vanished white figures a
plate of enduring bronze.
W. E. Stuart read a description
of the painting of the first numeral
bv Charles Burnell and Oliver P.
Morton, the account having been
written by Burnell who, could not
attend. Henrietta L. Stadtmuller,
one of 'lie best known of the Pio
neer poets, contributed some verses,
after the reading of which, two
plaintive voices came out of the
dark arcade; it was Shirley Baker
and Charles K. Field singing "In
the Cold, Cold World," which has
become an alumnus hymn. Then
Dennis Searles, who was president
of his class during its Commence
ment Week and who would have
had this duty if '95 had thought of
the custom instead of letting '96

invent it, unveiled the Pioneer
Plate and Charles K. Field pro
nounced the following dedication;
Dedication.
Pioneer Plate, lie here to testify
To one rich memory that may not
die.
Stronger than stone, better than
bronze, the thought
Of lasting work by earliest effort
wrought;
To that keen courage for these pas
tures new,
The heart of Argonauts to venture
through,
To tender impulse and to spirit
high,
Pioneer Plate, lie here and testify!
Pioneer Plate, though mighty
music swells
Above thee, and the solemn voice
of bells
Descends to bless thy vigil, though
the tread
Of generations wear thee in thy
bed,
To thy fine ear the feet of Pioneers
Shall sound along the corridor of
years;
Then to that ghostly presence, ever
nigh,
Pioneer Plate, lie here, and testify!
Then, joining hands in the un
certain light, the Pioneers circled
their memorial and together sang
"Auld Lang Syne."
Buses were waiting to take the
devotees to Palo Alto,where a table
had been spread in a local restur
ant. The table decorations were as
original as the services in the quad.

A narrow ridge of fresh earth ran
the length of the table, edged with
Stanford maiden-hair and red im
mortelles, these "everlastings" be
ing the only floral decoration.
Everywhere along the line of earth
were miniature iron tools, the im
plements of the Pioneers, shovels,
sledges, pick-axes, and at each end
the earth was crowned with a red
and-green savings-bank, the earth
about being sprinkled with brass
filings to imitate gold nuggets. In
the center of the table was a dwarf
tree, shaped to reproduce the saint
ed '95 Oak, rose from the mound
of earth, bound by a painted brick
coping on the edge of which a
miniature couple, a Varsity man
and a tennis maid, completing the
unique symbolism of the table.
Charles K. Field, better known
to the Pioneers as Carolus Ager,
had charge of the dedication and
dinner and acted informally as
toastmaster, calling forth many
reminiscences and spontaneous
toasts. Though it is to be expected
that '95 will have many larger and
more elaborate reunions, this first
re-gathering, almost impromptu,
will hardly be excelled in charac
teristic spirit.
