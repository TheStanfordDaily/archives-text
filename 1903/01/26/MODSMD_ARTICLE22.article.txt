# LODI LOSES TROPHY.
## Debaters from Alameda Carry Off Stanford Cup.â€” Question Well Handled. 
### 
The Alameda high school, repre
sented by Ira W. Kibby, Ralph
Marx, and Roswell Dague, won a
victory over the Lodi debaters in
the chapel Saturday evening, at
the annual contest of the Northern
California Debating League for the
Stanford trophy. Alameda had
the advantage in supporting the
more popular side of the question,
"Resolved, That California should
be divided into two states at Teha
chapi, the details of the boundary
to be determined by the proper
authorities.*' Her representatives
also proved more clever in present
ing their argument. President Jo
seph H. Page of the Intersociety
Debating League had charge of the
contest, and the judges were Prof.
C. R. Lewers, Instructor L. K. Bas
sett, and E. W. Rice, '02.
The Lodi debaters were support
ed by over a hundred loyal follow
ers, and Alameda was also well
represented. Alameda is entitled
to hold the cup one year. Lodi
has held the cup one year and
Humboldt high school of San Fran
cisco one year.
