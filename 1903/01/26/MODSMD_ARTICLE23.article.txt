# Changes in Gymnasium.

The system of furnishing towels
to the men in Encina gymnasium
has succeeded. By raising the
locker fee to two dollars the depart
ment has been able to furnish each
man a towel five times a week. A
Japanese janitor has been appoint
ed to distribute the towels and to
look after the locker-rooms.
For men who have had gymna
sium work for five or more semes
ters boxing, wrestling, and broad
swording have been substituted for
the regular apparatus work. It
was found that many of the men,
when they had taken several
semesters of gymnasium, dropped
out, mainly because the work had
lost its interest. This system was
accordingly introduced, and has
been a success from the first. The
work is under the direct charge of
S. L. Davis, '03, wrestling; R. B.
Standish, '06, boxing; and Mr. A.
K. von Noe, broadswording.
