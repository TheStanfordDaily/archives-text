# MUSICAL CLUBS' CONCERT.
## Glee and Mandolin Clubs Entertained Audience in Assembly Hall Last Friday Evening. 
### 
The concert given by the com
bined musical clubs Friday eve
ning was worthy of the unreserved
applause given by the audience.
Throughout, the concert was a sam
ple of the work done on the North
ern trip. The Glee Club, under
the leadership of C. H. Baker, '04,
sings better than for several years
past; and the Mandolin Club, with
Roy J. Keith, '03, for leader, does
splendid work. Of the numbers, it
is hard to mention any more deserv
ing than another. In the Glee
Club the parts were well balanced,
and none of the selections were be
yond the range of the tenors. Both
clubs showed the result of conscien
tious practice, hard work,and thor
ough leadership. The audience
was especially delighted with "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," and "Stanford
Red."
C. L. Firebaugh, '04, was com
pelled to respond to several encores,
and the selections of Leo Byrne, '05,
though familiar to Stanford audi
ences, called forth enthusiastic ap
plause. But Bush and Baker, with
their inimitable stunts, were easily
the stars of the evening.
