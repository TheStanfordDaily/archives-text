# CLASS BASEBALL.
## Freshmen and Sophomores Preparing for Annual Series of Games. 
### 
The class games have been post
poned indefinitely. If the weather
permits, the first of the series, the
Freshman-Sophomore game, will
be played the last of the week.
Otherwise both preliminary games
will be put off until next week.
Saturday afternoon the candi
dates for the Freshman baseball
team were put through their paces
by Sales, the Freshman captain.
From the showing of the past week
and the snappy work of Saturday,
the Sophomores will have a very
good class team to play against.
The infield gives promise of being
especially strong. Sales will pitch,
and Wiley in all probability will
be behind the bat. Colbert at first,
Weinmann at second, Wirt at short,
and Williams at third seem to be
the most promising candidates for
positions on the bases, while there
is a score of fairly good men fight
ing for places in the field. After
the Freshman team had finished
practice Saturday the Sophomores
took the field and did some fast
work.
A. L. Trowbridge was chosen last
Friday by the Sophomore baseball
men to captain them during the
interclass series. Trowbridge
Bhowed up well in his freshman
year and is playing a fast, snappy
game in the infield. He will play
shortstop on the class nine.
