# NEW CHEMISTRY BUILDING.
## A
						Description of the Different Floors, Laboratories, Equipments and Facilities. 
### 
Yesterday the new Chemistry
building was opened, classes in ele
mentary chemistry beginning work.
The building was begun in IUOO.
The Laboratory of the University
consists of two buildings, of buff
sandstone and the red tiled roofs
characteristic of the general archi
tecture of the University buildings.
The main building is in the form
of an H. The extreme length of
the building is about two hundred
and thirty-five feet, and the arms
one hundred feet long. It consists
of a basement, two main floors for
laboratory purposes, and an attic
containing several finished rooms.
The accessory building is situat
ed about fifty feet to the rear of the
main building, connected to it by
stone walls and gateways enclos
ing a paved court.
The construction of the building
was commenced in 1900 from plans
drawn by Clinton Day with the
advice of the professors of chemistry.
The basement contains store
rooms for apparatus and chemicals;
a boiler-room for heating the build
ing by steam heat and for produc
ing steam for chemical purposes,
and for operating the stills for dis
tilling water; the gas machine
which provides the fuel gas for lab
oratory use, a mixture of gasoline
vapor and air; a converter for sup
plying electric power for small mo
tors as well as for electro-chemical
work.
The first floor contains the main
lecture room —capable of seating
one hundred and sixty students;
the large laboratories for elemen
tary chemistry and for qualitative
analysis, each 00x40 feet, capable
of accommodating seventy-two stu
dents.
On this floor are situated special
laboratories for water analysis,
electro-chemistry, toxicology, gas
analysis, the supply room, and
smaller laboratories for use of in
structors and for research.
A room, 40x40, will be a museum
and collection room for the syste
matic arrangement of chemical
preparations illustrating scientific
series or technical processes.
The second floor is principally
for the use of more advanced stu
dents and for the offices and pri
vate laboratories of the professors.
Two laboratories, 60x40, will be
for students of quantitative analy
sis, and others in advanced work
of similar character. The labora
tories for organic and physical
chemistry, 40x40, each give work
ing places for about thirty students.
The laboratory for physiological
chemistry will accommodate some
twenty students. On the second
floor are situated also a small lec
ture room, a reading room, a com
bustion room for elementary or
ganic analysis, small laboratories
for professors and instructors, and
weighing rooms for the large labor
atories.
The attic contains the stills for
distilling water. These are two in
number, each connecting with a
separate tank tin-lined for a reser
voir, and these tanks communicate
by means of block-tin piping to

faucets in all the principal labora
tories.
The hallways on first and second
floors contain lockers for students.
The assaying laboratory in the
rear building contains a furnace
room equipped with fourteen cruci
ble furnaces, eight coke muffle
furnaces, and ten gasoline muffle
furnaces, accommodating easily
twenty-eight students. The analyti
cal laboratory adjoining permits of
the execution of volumetric assay

methods in connection with the
course. The building also con
tains a bullion room, fuel room and
milling and ore sample room,
weighing room, and smaller rooms
for special purposes.
The desks in all working labora
tories are provided with soapstone
tops and shelving of the same ma
terial. The large laboratories with
cement floors and brick walls, the
partitions in other parts of the
building of brick or iron meshwork
lathing, make the building almost
fireproof. The laboratories are sup
plied with thick earthenware sinks
and drain pipes of earthenware.
Ventilation is provided for by air
shafts in corners of all birge rooms,
and gas jets can lie lighted in each
to induce circulation. All the rooms
are high-ceiled and well lighted,
and electric lights are provided for
use when necessary.
The quantitative laboratories
and the electro-chemical labora
tory are provided with connections
for use of direct current for electric
deposition of copper or other metals,
thus obviating the use of the small
cell batteries. So alsoin the quan
titative and organic laboratories —
smooth planed cast-iron boxes
heated by steam are provided for
digestion of solutions or at higher
temperatures for dehydration. The
physical chemistry laboratory is
also eqtupped with direct current,
with steam, and with thermostat.
The organic, laboratory has steam
tups nt each working place, and
vacuum taps for (Titrations and for
distillations at reduced pressure.
The vacuum taps nre alsoin the
qua ntitative la bora tories.
There are some four hundred
working places in all laboratories.
