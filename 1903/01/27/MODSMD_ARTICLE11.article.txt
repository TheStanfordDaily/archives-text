Last year the Junior committees
were not appointed until late in
February. Before the members of
the Farce and Ball Committees
could get together but little time
was left for preparation. In fact
the farce was selected and put on
within three weeks time. There is
no reason why the Junior class
this year should not begin at once.
Two months is none too long for
the selection and staging of a farce.
