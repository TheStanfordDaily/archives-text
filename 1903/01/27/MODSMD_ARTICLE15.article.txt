Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Allow me through your columns
to confer to the ushers at the dedi
cation services my appreciation of
their work.
It was done with patience and
courtesy, and all who attended tbe
services were comfortably seated.
May I also by this means ask
for volunteers for usher duty in the
future? The names may be sent
to the vestry before Friday.
Yours faithfully,
D. Charles Gardner.
