# TALKS ON ATHLETICS.
## Lanagan, '00, and Mr. Harrison of the Olympic Club Speak to Students and Faculty. 
### 
The second University Assembly
of the semester met this morning
at the fourth hour. James F. Lan
agan, '00, spoke on "The Athletic
Relations of the University and
Secondary Schools"; and William
Greer Harrison, president of the
Olympic Club of San Francisco,
spoke on "Purity in Athletics."
Lanagan was given a rousing
reception by hisold fellow-students.
When the Varsity yell had subsid
ed, he said:
"The university athlete, more
than any other man, iB a genuine
hero to a high school youth or a
boy attending a preparatory school.
The captain of a football team or
of a baseball'Or track team is more
talked about 'and more looked up
to than a major professor; and a
head coach who plans out victories
in his calm way has more admira
tion from the boys of near-by sec
ondary schools than the president
himself. It is for this reason that
college athletics hold such a re
sponsible position with reference to
academic athletics.
"What goes in the university is
bound to go in the lower schools.
If college athletes make a good
stand for cleat*' work, if they are
kept up to a high standard of
scholarship, the result will tell im
mediately for good in the lower
schools. Here at Stanford we have
had a good stand made for the
right sort of athletics, and any in
terest a college athlete will take in
the athletics of surrounding lower
schools will come back repaid a
hundred fold from those lower
schools. The professors who have
the instruction of college men do
not have to begin with the ele
ments, but too r pften,.a college
coach or captain has tri spend his
time shaping up raw material.
With the increased interest taken
in secondary schools, college teams
will be getting in men trained for
one thing and ready for practice in
team-work and the finer points of
the game, and loyal men from the
start of their college career."
After the Glee Club had sung
"Fill Your Steins," Dr. Jordan in
troduced Mr. Harrison, who said:
"In the recent stand of this Uni
versity for pure, clean •athletics you
find the Olympic Club right
with you. I hope that you will
keep right on in the good work.
The Club is going to stand for the
same principle, and would if we
had to turn out every athlete from
it and have only the bare walls
left. If you find an athlete some
times a little shaky in these mat
ters treat him kindly and beat him
squarely, and the chances are he
will come around.
"A long while Ago the world be
gan, and men have been walking
around since they climbed out of
the primeval ooze, perhaps a bun
dled thousand, perhaps a hundred
million years ago. Woman has
changed a good deal, but man is
pretty much the same animal he
was that long ago. And the very
first progress man made toward
real civilization came with his first
feeling for fair play.

"Sometimes in the intense desire
to win from the men of another
college In an athletic contest, you
may be tempted to use means not
fair. Never win on a foul. It is
not absolutely necessary to win,
but it is necessary to deserve to
win. A victory is only temporary.
''In the old days of chivalry the
knights who fought contended not
for themselves nor for any material
advantage, but for honor, generally
for the honor of some lady whom
they reverenced. And no knight's
sword was ever sold. In the mod
ern world the nearest approach we
have to the form and spirit of the
struggle in the lists of old is the
athletic field, where you, young
men, sometimes meet your friends
in rivalry, and in it defend the fair
name of your Alma Mater.
"One reason why you should be
so jealous in the matter of college
athletics is that the eyes of the
world are upon you in your inter
collegiate contests. We of the pri
vate club organizations can do
something for pure athletics, but
the colleges can do everything.
For weeks before and after your
annual contests the public looks to
you to see how athletics are run.
In the slang of today it is there
fore 'up to you' to show that they
can be and must be run right.
"In closing let me say to the men
before me that whether they devote
their efforts to winning the favor of
the fair sex or to the subjects of
the curriculum or to winning tro
phies on the athletic field, the main
thing for them to do is 'to put their
hearts into the work.'"

The second University Assembly
of the semester met this morning
at the fourth hour. James F. Lan
agan, '00, spoke on "The Athletic
Relations of the University and
Secondary Schools"; and William
Greer Harrison, president of the
Olympic Club of San Francisco,
spoke on "Purity in Athletics."
Lanagan was given a rousing
reception by hisold fellow-students.
When the Varsity yell had subsid
ed, he said:
"The university athlete, more
than any other man, iB a genuine
hero to a high school youth or a
boy attending a preparatory school.
The captain of a football team or
of a baseball'Or track team is more
talked about 'and more looked up
to than a major professor; and a
head coach who plans out victories
in his calm way has more admira
tion from the boys of near-by sec
ondary schools than the president
himself. It is for this reason that
college athletics hold such a re
sponsible position with reference to
academic athletics.
"What goes in the university is
bound to go in the lower schools.
If college athletes make a good
stand for cleat*' work, if they are
kept up to a high standard of
scholarship, the result will tell im
mediately for good in the lower
schools. Here at Stanford we have
had a good stand made for the
right sort of athletics, and any in
terest a college athlete will take in
the athletics of surrounding lower
schools will come back repaid a
hundred fold from those lower
schools. The professors who have
the instruction of college men do
not have to begin with the ele
ments, but too r pften,.a college
coach or captain has tri spend his
time shaping up raw material.
With the increased interest taken
in secondary schools, college teams
will be getting in men trained for
one thing and ready for practice in
team-work and the finer points of
the game, and loyal men from the
start of their college career."
After the Glee Club had sung
"Fill Your Steins," Dr. Jordan in
troduced Mr. Harrison, who said:
"In the recent stand of this Uni
versity for pure, clean •athletics you
find the Olympic Club right
with you. I hope that you will
keep right on in the good work.
The Club is going to stand for the
same principle, and would if we
had to turn out every athlete from
it and have only the bare walls
left. If you find an athlete some
times a little shaky in these mat
ters treat him kindly and beat him
squarely, and the chances are he
will come around.
"A long while Ago the world be
gan, and men have been walking
around since they climbed out of
the primeval ooze, perhaps a bun
dled thousand, perhaps a hundred
million years ago. Woman has
changed a good deal, but man is
pretty much the same animal he
was that long ago. And the very
first progress man made toward
real civilization came with his first
feeling for fair play.

"Sometimes in the intense desire
to win from the men of another
college In an athletic contest, you
may be tempted to use means not
fair. Never win on a foul. It is
not absolutely necessary to win,
but it is necessary to deserve to
win. A victory is only temporary.
''In the old days of chivalry the
knights who fought contended not
for themselves nor for any material
advantage, but for honor, generally
for the honor of some lady whom
they reverenced. And no knight's
sword was ever sold. In the mod
ern world the nearest approach we
have to the form and spirit of the
struggle in the lists of old is the
athletic field, where you, young
men, sometimes meet your friends
in rivalry, and in it defend the fair
name of your Alma Mater.
"One reason why you should be
so jealous in the matter of college
athletics is that the eyes of the
world are upon you in your inter
collegiate contests. We of the pri
vate club organizations can do
something for pure athletics, but
the colleges can do everything.
For weeks before and after your
annual contests the public looks to
you to see how athletics are run.
In the slang of today it is there
fore 'up to you' to show that they
can be and must be run right.
"In closing let me say to the men
before me that whether they devote
their efforts to winning the favor of
the fair sex or to the subjects of
the curriculum or to winning tro
phies on the athletic field, the main
thing for them to do is 'to put their
hearts into the work.'"
