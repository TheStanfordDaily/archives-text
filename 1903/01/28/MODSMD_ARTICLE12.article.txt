bating team had not included at
least one woman. Not farther
back than 1900 the Intercollegiate
honors came to grace the Cardinal
largely because of the clever and

rivalry which all should delight to
enter is fast being closed to women
students by a precedent that will
soon become a tradition. The ex
planation for such a condition is
hard to discover. A solution re
