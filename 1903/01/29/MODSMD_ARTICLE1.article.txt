# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETS.
## Considers Building of New Tennis Court and Accepts Tennis Club Constitution. 
### 
The Executive Com mil tee met
last night and considered the lay
ing of a,new tennis court, the con
stitution of the Tennis Club, and
the application of 'the Women's
Athletic Association for $50, with
which to prepare grounds for the
playing of hockey.
The committee discussed the ten
nis proposition. The.sense of the
committee was that a court laid 011
new ground would be preferable to
one laid across"two of the asphalt
Encina coutts. Manager Edwards
explained that by making the court
smaller than the one considered at
the previous meeting a court could
be put down for ri s737, two of the
old courts being used as founda
tions. The committee passed a
motion allowing $737 for such a
court, or $850 for a court of the
same size to be built on new
ground, the latter being preferred.
The committee appointed to re
vise the constitution presented by
the Tennis Club., reported their
amendments. The constitution as
revised was accepted.
In consideration of the fact that
the Women's Athletic Association
had not been granted permission
to play hockey.,by the faculty,
action concerning their request
was delayed.
