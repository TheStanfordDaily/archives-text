Dkspitk the explanation of the
president of the student body made
before the University Assembly
yesterday —made on that particu
lar occasion in order to vary the
monotony of giving out unimport
ant notices —the Daily Palo Alto
finds itself thoroughly satisfied
with the editorial published in its
columns last Friday. We would not
consider the matter worth mention
ing were it not for the fact that the
committee's attitude may work
harm to the tennis cause.
The resolutions as read purport
ed to come from the Executive Com
mittee. They were in fact by no
means unanimous, having been
passed at a meeting to which all
members of the committee were not
invited. Also, as shown by the
communication of Treasurer Ed
wards published in tonight's issue,
and the fact that the committee
had no more data to act upon last
night than they had had at the
previous meeting, the Daily's state
ment that the extra week of delay
was absolutely unnecessary seems
substantiated.
But the contract has been let
and tomorrow the work will com
mence. Every well-wisher of Stan
ford athletics cannot but rejoice. A
tennis man at Stanford has never
had a fair chance to win; whatever
victories have been brought home
from the intercollegiate meets have
come in spile of the lack of prac
tice.
Some three hundred dollars is
3'et to be raised. The response of
the student body so far has been
everything that could lie expected,

and that it should continue so un
til sum is raised is the least
that can be expected of a student
body reasonably interested in an
undergraduate activity.
