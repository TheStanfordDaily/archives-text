Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The paper read by C. F. Dittmar
before the Assembly yesterday,
purporting to have come from the
Executive Committee, has made it
seem advisable to me, in view of
the fact that the tennis court con
tract has been let, to make some
comment. His paper grossly mis
represented a number of facts
which should be made clear to the
student body before I can ask those
misled to hand in subscriptions.
In the first place, the Executive
Committee has never been asked to
"expend an amount approaching
$1000." The price did not aggre
gate $850. The amount has now
been cut to $737. The size of the
court is to be 98x47 feet —some eight
feet more on each end, and three feet
wider than the present Encina
courts —and not, as was said, "an
abbreviated court . . . barely
large enough to include the lines of
the court proper."
Next, I doubt if it is the senti
ment of the student body to hazard
our chances in intercollegiate ten
nis by delaying the building of a
good court for at least three years
and"put up with the present in
conveniences for a time longer." It
is the policy of the management to
give the football, squad the best
gridiron, the baseball men the best
diamond, and the track men the
best track possible within reason.
The tennis candidates are certainly
entitled to the Bame consideration.
Up to the present time they have
received practically nothing.
Again the "present courts . . .
could be repaired to good advant
age." This is not true, according
to the expert opinion of four differ
ent contractors who have personally
looked the courts over. This was
explained to the Executive Com
mittee at two different meetings.
Furthermore, the present courts
are not laid in the right direction,
and one player is forced to face the
sun all the time. The courts
should be laid from north to south.
This important fact was not
mentioned: 1). E. Brown, the con
tractor, has promised to let all but
$600 of the payment run a year or
more if we desire it.
The matter stands now as fol
lows: The new 98x47 bitumen
court to be placed over two of the
present ones is to cost 1(5 cents a
square foot.
Toward the payment of this the
Sophomore Minstrel Show netted
$230. Over $225 has been prom
ised by subscription, and the bal
ance of the $737 must be raised the
same way. I feel that the whole
amount can be raised this semester
if the student body will look at the
matter in its true light. The co
operation of every member of the
student body is needed.
