# WORK ON TRACK.
## Training Again Under Full Swing. Heavy Rains Have No Serious Effect on Squad. 
### 
The recent showers did not ser
iously interfere with the training
on the track. The whole cinder
path is in a condition to he used
and the back stretch is in excellent
shape! This is in great contrast to
last year,when no part of the track
was in condition to he run on for
several weeks. Unfortunately the
runways for the high and hroad
jump and pole-vault were not cov
ered as planned, and consequently
they are soft and will not he avail
able for use for some time to come.
The men who are trying for the
jumps and pole-vault are working
at breaking, away from the mark
and sprinting. The other men tire
still loosening up.
Instructor E. B. Copeland, '95, e
x trackman and holder of the
Stanford half-mile record, is coach
ing the calraidateßfor the half-mile.
Copeland and Trainer Moulton
have worked together before at
Wisconsin! l'he captain and train
er are very djßsixOus that the cand
idates come out not later than five
o'clock. The sun goes down after
that lime, and the cold and evening
dews are very injurious to the men,
— colds and Bore'inuscles are liable
to result. Either Captain McCaugh
ern or Trainer Moulton is on the
track every hour of the day.
►Several prepositions have come
from California relative to the re
lay race in the coming Intercolleg
iate meet. Berkeley has a
five and one-half lap track,
and this presents some diffi
culties. Berkeley's 'latest proposi
tion is to have one man run twice,
the first man to run half a lap and
then in the last relay run the full
distance. This '"Means that one
man sprints twice and runs a dis
tance of 480 yards to the 820 yards
of the other men. It is not likely
that the proposition will be accept
ed- I l|.
The meet with the University of
Washington is still under consider
ation. The rubbing quarters on
the oval are entirely completed and
have been fitted ofit- with tables
and a stove. There ore several
windows admitting plenty of light
without letting in any cold air.
Trainer Moulton and bis family
will leave the training house at the
end of this month alid move to
College Terrace. The present quar
ters are crowded, and Moulton has
been contemplating moving for
some time. .112,
