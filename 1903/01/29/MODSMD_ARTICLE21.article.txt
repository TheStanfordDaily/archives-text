# COLPE CONVICTED
## After Two Hours Deliberation the Jury Returns a Verdict of Guilty. 
### 
The trial of Geo. E. Colpe, pro
prietor of the Palace Pharmacy in
Palo Alto, on the charge of engag
ing in an illicit liquor traffic, wan
ended last night. The prosecution
rested its case in the afternoon,
having been successful in making
a clear case against the druggist.
Several witnesses, including the
defendant, testified for the defense
to the effect that mo liquor had
been sold without a prescription
from a regularly licensed physician,
but the registered prescription file
of the store failed to corroborate
these statements. After the argu
ments by counsel, Justice Charles
gave the case to the jury. These
twelve men, whose ranks were filled
by Palo Alto business men and
two University students, one of
whom was a former instructor, —all
students and members of the fac
ulty not having been challenged, as
stated in last night's Daily
Palo Alto, —after deliberating for
two hours returned a verdict
of guilty. To the zeal of Professor
Sanford is attributed the initiative
in taking up this case,a step which
will undoubtedly be followed by
further prosecutions.
