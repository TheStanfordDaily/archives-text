# COMBINED CONCERTS.
## Musical Clubs of Stanford and California Will Appear Before University Audiences. 
### 
Steps are being taken for conceits
in which the musical clubs of both
California and Stanford will take
part. No definite arrangements
have as yet been made, but it is
understood that the combined clubs
will appear before a Stanford audi
ence on the evening of April 11th,
after the second game of the base
ball series, which will bo played on
the Stanford campus. The date
for the concert in Berkeley has not
been decided upon. The evening
after the first intercollegiate game,
April 4th, or the evening after the
third game, in case a third game
is necessary, may be decided upon
for the concert before the students
of the University of California.
The Stanford Glee and Mandolin
Clubs are contemplating trips to
San Jose, Santa Cruz and Monterey.
It is more than likely that no dates
will l>e arranged for the two latter
places. The concert in San Jose
will be given about the middle of
March.
