# COLUMBIA BOYS ON CAMPUS.
## Creditable Showing Made by Young Fellows in Assembly Hall and Gymnasiun. 
### 
A group of thirty-five boys from
the Columbia Park Boys' Club of
San Francisco came to the Univer
sity yesterday under the direction
of Sydney Peixotto, the head of the
institution, and won enthusiastic
applause in the three exhibitions
they gave on the campus. In the
morning they gave exhibition drills
at the Palo Alto high school and
on the circle in Palo Alto.
After the fourth hour the boys
drilled on the pavement fronting
Memorial Church. Accompanying
the present section of the organiza
tion is a drum corps of eight boys,
which played and marched in a
highly creditable manner. The
drilling of the little fellows showed
an unusual amount of careful work,
and brought round after round of
applause from the onlookers.
In the afternoon a good exhibi
tion of gymnastic work was given
in Encina gymnasium. About
thirty of the boys, provided with
complete gymnasium outfits, were
put through the setting-up exercises
by the bt>y leader, after which the
entire class worked on the buck
and mat. On the whole their form
was very good; the grit of the little
fellows \vas remarkable. Not one
refused, to do the exercises set, and,
although some of the boys received
pretty bard knocks, there were no
complaints heard. The mat work
was especially good. Mr. Peixotto
explained that these were bis
singers and not his gymnasts. Af
ter the formal exhibition the boys
spent half an , hour in playing on
the apparatus.
An enthusiastic and well-pleased
audience attended the concert given
in the evening in Assembly Hall
by the Boy-Cliorus.
The programme consisted of
twenty numbers. The selections
were of a delightful character, folk
song, ballads, and melodies of the
people, and classical songH cover
ing a wide range of composers,
Schubert, Schumann, Rubinstein.
"Good King Wenceslas," the solo
parts sung by Masters Lavell and
Jones, was a pleasing number. The
traditional Christmas "Wassail
Song," as sung by the English
'wades" was a treat to hear.
"Santa Lucia," a Neapolitan folk
song. was rendered with softness
and rhythm true to the South. The
soloists showed training and talent,
and a self-possession not always
found in professionals much older.
Even the smallest lads handled
their voices with ease and preci
sion. Master McKeon sang "Mary
of Argyle" with great sweetness.
Master Talbot delighted lovers of
Schubert with his rendition of
"Who is Sylvia?" Master O'Day
showed a full, strong voice. The
soloists were repeatedly encored.
The youth of the performers, and
especially the unusilally pleasing
nature of the songs, made the con
cert of last evening one of the most
enjoyable entertainments given at
Stanford for some time.
The hoys vvere taken care of last
night by students in Encina, the
fraternities, anil members of the
faculty.
