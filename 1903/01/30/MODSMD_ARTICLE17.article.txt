the country discontinued cashing
local checks from other towns
without charge.
This compelled the purchase of
exchange for the payment of dis
tant accounts.
To avoid this expense the Hook
store opened an account in New
York City, and requests persons
having Eastern exchange to bring
it to them to We cashed without
charge.

Special meetings may be called
at any time by the president, but
no action taken at a special meet
ing shall be considered legal unless
it shall have received the vote of at
least five members of the committee,
and when all members shall have
been given due notice of the meet
ing.
