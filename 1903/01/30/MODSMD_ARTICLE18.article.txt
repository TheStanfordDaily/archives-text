Editor Daily Palo Alto:
We, the following members of
the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students, desire to make
the following statement in reply to
the communication of Treasurer
If. J. Edwards appearing in yes
terday's Daily Palo Alto:
President Dittmar's statement
before the University Assembly
Wednesday was made authorita
tively, and represented our atti
tude. The committee resented the
attempt made at its previous meet
ing, and afterwards, to have such
an important matter as this outlay
rushed through without giving it
due and proper consideration.
