Mr. Sidney Peixotto, head of the
Columbia Park Boys' Club, ad
dressed the classes in Crime and
Penology and in Education 1 in
the chapel at 9:15 this morning.
He reviewed the history of the
club, saying that it was founded
not by one person but by a group
of young men, most all of whom
were artists. Since its founding a
gradual increase has taken place
in the number of attendants and

in the facilities for and variety of
instruction. The speaker told in
detail the manner of handling the
boys, and gave many interesting
incidents of his associations with
the youngsters.
Mr. Peixotto impressed one as be
ing of a very gentle disposition, as
a man of enduring patience,
admirably fitted to gain the respect
of those who are in his charge and
to enter into sympathy with them.
