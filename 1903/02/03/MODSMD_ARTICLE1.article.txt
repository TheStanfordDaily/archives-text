# BASEBALL PRACTICE.
## Freshmen, Varsity, and Second Team Did Good Work on Diamond Last Night. 
### 
Fair weather and a field nearly
dry gave the baseball men the first
opportunity for practice that Ihey
have had for nearly a week. The
diamond was the scene of unceasing
activity from two in the afternoon
until darkness put a stop to the
work. Sales took his Freshman
squad in hand early in the day,
and under his direction the candi
dates went through some fast infield
work. The outlook for a strong
Freshman team is very encourag
ing. Sales and Wiley constitute an
exceptionally strong battery, and
the infield is of a high order. The
candidates for the outfield are
fighting hard for places, the victory
probably to go to the men strong
est with the bat.
About four o'clock the Varsity
men began to appear and with the
Second team men were put through
some fast work under the eye of
Coach Swindells. A half-dozen
interesting innings were played.
Parker and Studley each had a
turn in the box for the Varsity,
while two freshmen, Sales and Col
bert, pitched for the Second.
McGilvray caught for the Varsity
and Bruce Ball was behind the bat
for the Second. Although none of
the men are in batting form, yet
the showing Sales made was ex
cellent. He struck out a number
of men and kept the Varsity from
scoring during the time he was in
the box. The fielding of both teams
was very erratic and showed the
effect of a week's absence from the
diamond., The men lined up in
the following order:

Bleachers are under process of
construction on the edge of the old
field, moving the ones from the
oval back and forth having been
found ruinous to the bleachers.
