The new spirit which members
of the Band have shown this year
is certainly commendable. In the
past the Band has been raked to
gether at the commencement of
each September, and, aftfr two
months' practice on hired instru
ments, lias appeared at the Inter
collegiate football game, after
which it has gone out of existence
until the following fall. Under
these conditions it was impossible
that it should ever equal the band
of the University of California,
whose members are provided with
the best instruments at the expense
of the State, and are allowed uni
versity credit for their work. This
year, however, should see a com
plete change in the character of the
University Band. New instru
ments have been secured through
the enterprise of the leaders, with
out cost to the University or to the
student body. New men have
been interested, and a permanent
form of organization effected, so
that after each vacation the neces
sity of a completely new beginning
will be obviated. Even if the
Stanford Band cannot compete
with California in numbers, it may
at least in the future as it has at
times in the past, equal it in excel
lence. This change in attitude is
one that has long been needed, and
those who are responsible for it are
entitled to praise.
The spirit which has made a
stable organization out of the Band
seems also to have permeated the
Girls' Glee Club and the Orchestra.
Both start out this semester better
organized for systematic work and
for giving a larger return in care
ful training to their members than
ever before. Within the last few
years the Gymnasium Clubs, the
Spanish Club, the English Club,
the Women's League, and similar
organizations and societies have
had their beginning and have de
veloped into effective and useful

adjuncts to University life. In ac
cordance as theße societies perform
their functions and prove of value
to those cooperating in sustaining
them, will they thrive or die. That
the Band, the Girls' Glee Club, and
the Orchestra have taken on new
life, is evidence of effective work.
