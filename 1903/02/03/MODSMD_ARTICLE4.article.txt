# JAPANESE TEA.
## Interesting and Unique Entertainment to be Given by Oriental Student Club. 
### 
Invitations are out for what
promises to be not only one of the
most interesting, but also one of
the most unique social affairs ever
given at Stanford. It will be in
the nature of an informal tea
party at the Japanese Student
Club on College Terrace Sunday
afternoon. The guests will include
members of the faculty, students,
and a number of people from San
Francisco, among whom are Hon.
Uyerro, the Japanese consul, Mr.
Tozawa, president of the Yokohama
Specie Bank, Mr. Ito, manager of
the Japanese Steamship Co., and
Mr. Mikimoto, manager of Mitsui
& Co. Arrangements will be made
for some sketching by Japanese
artists and for Japanese music.
The Japanese Club was founded
at the beginning of last semester,
and, as the means of uniting the
Japanese students at Stanford, has
been so successful that in all prob
ability a club-house will be built
for its use before very long. There
are at present twenty-two mem
bers. The new house will accommo
date fifty and will cost in the
neighborhood of seven thousand
dollars.
