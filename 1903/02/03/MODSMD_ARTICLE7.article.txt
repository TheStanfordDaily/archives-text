# RETURN OF McLEOD.
## The 						Popular Rubber Will Help Get the Track Men Into Condition. 
### 
"Billy" McLeod, the genial
Scotchman, who fur several years
was rubber fur the Stanford athletic
teams, arrived yesterday and has
taken a room in the training-house.
He was welcomed by the athletes,
with whom he has always been
popular. Since May, 1901, McLeod
has been engaged in business enter
prise in Portland, Ore. He was
closely connected with the Mult
nomah Athletic club.
Now that the captain and
trainer have someone to help
thein in getting the men
into condition, the severer
part of training will commence.
The men will soon be running hard
trials. Serious effects in sore mus
cles and colds will be obviated by
care from McLeod.
The last few days of dry weather
had put the track in excellent con
dition. Today's rain will delay
work for a day or two. Crawford
threw the hammer last night and
did remarkably well. He used
two turns with a great deal of
facility, and managed to stay in
the ring. As he has made several
throws of over 138 feet and is a
steady, consistent trainer, he may
be safely picked as a first-place
man in this event. J. J. Monzingo,
'05, has been working with Craw
ford at the hammer-throw.
