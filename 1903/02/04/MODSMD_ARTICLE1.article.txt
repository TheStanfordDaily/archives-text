# LECTURE BY FON FOO SEC.
## Chinese Student from the University of California Speaks Before Y.M.C.A. 
### 
Mr. Fon Fuo Sec, a Chinese stu
dent nt the University of Califor
nia delivered the second address of
the Y. M. C. A. series in the chapel
last night on "Educational Reform
in China."
He lirst reviewed the old educa
tional system of the Chinese Em
pire, and in this connection dwelt
upon the literati—the educated and
student class of Chinese, to which
he belongs—and their method of
acquiring an education. The Chi
nese student is educated by private
instructors hired by his parents, or
by himself and a few of his associ
ates after he has grown to man
hood. This education is acquired
in preparation for the great exami
nations given by the government
annually in Hong Kong, Tien Tain,
and Pekin. The literati, he said, are
the conservative element in China.
Speaking of the effect which the
war against Japan had upon
China, he said it showed that a
change in the Chinese educational
policy is necessary. The Dowager
Empress, recognizing this, through
an edict issued eight months ago
changed the whole educational sys
tem, modeling it after the Western
nations and Japan. A second
edict, coming two months after the
first, provided for the employment
of five hundred Japanese teachers
in China. This, the speaker said,
is significant of greater friendship
between Japan and China.
The work of the Y. M. C. A.
among the literati—a class vari
ously estimated as numbering from
800,000 to 1,000,000 men —is con
siderable. The international com
mittee of the Association recognizes
the strategic advantage of China
and the importance of gaining the
country for Christianity. It is
sending a large number of educa
tional secretaries there. The seri
ousness of the task is shown by the
fact that ninety per cent of the
Chinese are agnostics, the remain
ing ten per cent being Buddhists,
Confucianists, Shintooists, and
Christians.
The lecture, though not largely
attended, was listened to with a
great amount of interest.
