It is to forestall an offense that
has been of frequent occurrence
in the past, that a word about the
baseball field is considered neces
sary. After each rain the diamond
has been in such miserable condi
tion as to require scraping before
being fit for practice. Numbers of
men are entirely oblivious to the
fact that tramping on a muddy
field leaves tracks that roughen the
ground so that it is nearly valueless
as a place for ball practice. In
spite of the protests of the players,
and the student body treasurer,and
the editorials of student publica
tions, each semester shows that
there are dozens of offenders. Noth
ing can be said in their defense.
The desire to save a few steps is
greater than the desire for a well
trained baseball team. The man
who continues to indulge in the
practice proclaims himself at once
selfish and unpatriotic. No word
should be necessary to the men
who heard Lanagan speak in the
last University Assembly. It is to
the man who does not know where
the baseball field is and would not

care if he did that a severe rebuke
ie necessary. He is worse than a
man who breaks training rules.
