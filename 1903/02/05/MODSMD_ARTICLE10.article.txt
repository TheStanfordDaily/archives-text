Thk Seniors last semester decided
to adopt a class pin. A design was
chosen and everything seemed fair
toward the establishment of a tra
dition for future classes to follow.
But the second semester is well
along and out of the hundred and
seventy or more Seniors only fifteen
have signified their intention of
purchasing the insignia. Many
have deferred ordering a pin until
after the sample could be seen. The
sample is now on exhibition at the
Bookstore and orders should be in
at once. Unless a very large per
centage of the class purchase pine,
next year 1904 may not see fit to
consider the matter at all.
