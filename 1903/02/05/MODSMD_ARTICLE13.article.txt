# Lawyer Talks to Students.

### 
Mr. William A. Beasley, Michi
gan '91, a practicing lawyer of San
Jose, spoke before the Law students
of the University last evening upon
a phase of his profession for which
the law school proper affords little
preparation. "Use of Public Rec
ords and Public Offices" was the
subject of his address, and in an
interesting and personal way Mr.
Beasley spoke of the trials of a
young lawyer, and of what a knowl
edge of public records means to
him throughout his public career.
In appreciation of the difficulties
incident upon practice the neces
sity for thorough familiarity with
the records to be found in the re
corder's office and the advantages
of being in amicable relations with
the officials of public offices were
shown. Mr. Beasley was intro
duced by Frank W. Doan, Law '03,
representing the law fraternity of
Phi Delta Phi, under whose invita
tion Mr. Beasley spoke. It is
probable that the fraternity during
the semester will provide several
addresses to the members of the
department by men who have spent
several years in practice.
