# Want Games With Coast Teams.
## 
### 
According to a New York dis
patch the Columbia University
football management has practical
ly completed arrangements for a
game with California and Stanford
on the Coast next December. Pres
ident Butler has given his consent,
and it is expected that no financial
obstacles will arise. The move
ment is due to W. M. Erb, '01,
Stanford's former half-back, and
Captain Smith, who played on the
University of Oregon team two
years ago. For a number of years
tentative arrangements have been
made for a Stanford-Columbia
game, but the plans have never
been carried out. Columbia sees
excellent prospects for a strong
team next fall and the time is
thought favorable for a western
trip.
