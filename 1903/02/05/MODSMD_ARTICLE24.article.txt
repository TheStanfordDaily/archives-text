# Close of the "Quad" Competition.
## 
### 
The literary department of the
Quad has received a number of
stories but as yet the poems sub
mitted are very few in number.
Monday morning the stories and
poems submitted will be turned
over to Professors Newcomer and
Alden and Instructor Cook, who
will choose the prize winners. How
ever, there will be published more
stories and poems than the regular
prize winners, provided material is
received of a worthy nature.
Several persons are writing poems
which they have not been able to
finish, and for the special accom
modation of these, work that is
received before Sunday night will
be admitted to the competition.
