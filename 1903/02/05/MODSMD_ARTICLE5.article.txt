# THE 						ELIZABETHAN PLAY.
## A 						Discussion of the Things That Appear Uppermost in the Rehearsals. 
### 
Rehearsals for the "Knight of
the Burning Pestle" are at such a
stage now that it is possible to form
some idea of how the play will
work out when finally produced on
an Elizabethan stage that is to he
especially constructed in Assembly
Hall. The historical setting —the
plain stage with its two entrances,
the gallery from which Merry
thought sings his saucy songs and
is reproved so roundly by the Gro
cer's Wife, the arras, and the
chairs for the gallants, the costum
ing, and the incidental music and
dancing—will greatly enhance the
interest and effectiveness of the
play. But apart from this there
will be a series of quickly moving
scenes, with strong comedy interest,
to the developing of which the
actors are working regularly and
conscientiously.
The best character is that of the
Grocer's Wife, who, though she
does not take direct part in the
action of the play, nevertheless
makes her presence felt from the
moment she comes upon the stage
and takes her place with the gal
lants to one side. If the function
of the Greek chorus is to moralize
on the action of the play, this hon
est woman most admirably takes
its place, and more, for though a
Greek chorus might assist Ralph in
his fight with the giant barber, it
would never go so far as to com
fort him with a piece of sugar can
dy, or offer to pay for Ralph's
lodging in the castle to save that
beloved knight from being putin
jail. The Grocer himself has
equally strong moral force, strong
enough to change the action of the
play when it does not suit him, and
a tender side, too, when his flus
tered spouse has need of his com
forting support.
Ralph, once grocer's apprentice,
but raised suddenly to be "Knight
of the Burning Pestle," stalks at
will into any part of the action
which the players are giving, his
sole purpose to rescue such dis
tressed damsels and confound such
caitiff wretches as he may chance
to find. Don Quixote was no more
singlo-minded, and certainly not
half so triumphantly successful.
In the comedy that would have
gone on decorously to its conclu
sion had not the Grocer, to the hor
ror of all London citizens, decreed
otherwise, there are some notewor
thy characters and interesting sit
uations Jasper, who dares, like
other romantic heroes, to love his
master's daughter,' has. a mailed
knight to overcome, as an unex
pected addition to his other obsta
cles; but his valor on that occasion
is as his resourcefulness in the
coflin scene near the end. Relieved
against the lighter comedy element
are some strong scenes in which
Jasper and Luce appear.
Merrythought, rollicking and
jovial, whose irresponsible gaiety is
as distasteful to the good Grocer's
Wife as it is to his own provident
spouse, has an especially interest
ing part in that his lines are largely
'made up of scraps of Elizabethan

songs and ballad**, titled most in
geniously to the occasions of his ca
pricious humor. The music for
these random hits and for the
longer songs has all been taken
from Elizabethan song-books.
The gruff and ill-used Venture
well, the unfortunate lover Huiii
phray, the Barber, the Host, the
Tapster, and the boys who take
part in the action need mention,
for they all contribute to the action
of the play, and in no pniall meas
ure to its tone coloring.
The English Club was peculiarly
happy in selecting this play for
careful production, ambitious
though the project was. Few
plays give such good opportunities
of reproducing, as far as they are
known, the stage conditions of
Elizabethan times. The play itself,
moreover, has the intrinsic merit of
being a comedy of genuine value.
Comedy it is—that must be em
phasized; for though the spirit is
so audacious that it approaches
burlesque at times, yet it never
goes frankly beyond the bounds of
genuine comedy. To keep that
delicate distinction will be the
most difficult task for the actors.
