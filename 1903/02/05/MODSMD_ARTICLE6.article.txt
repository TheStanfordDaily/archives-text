# PROM COMMITTEE MEETS.
## Invitations to the Big Junior Dance May Be Placed at Five Dollars. 
### 
The Junior Prom Committee met
last night to discuss the prelimin
ary arrangements for the big dance.
Chairman llenley presided. Owing
to the fact that the Freshman and
Sophomore dances will not he
given this year, and that the
Senior Ball does not come until
after college closes, the Junior
From practically becomes the only
big dance during the semester.
Consequently it is expected that
the attendance will be very heavy,
and at the meeting last night some
fear was expressed that the Encina
club-room would not be sufficiently
large to contain the crowd. For
this reason it was suggested that
the tickets be placed at $5, in
stead of $4, as heretofore, so that
the attendance might be a little
lessened without detriment to the
profits relied upon by the class to
coverall their expenses. Thecom
mittee generally favored this plan,
but no definite action was taken.
A prize of $5 was offered for the
best program design.
The matter of music and decora
tion also came up for discussion
and Biib-committees were appointed
bv the chairman. Miss Hale is
chairman of the committee on dec
oration.
