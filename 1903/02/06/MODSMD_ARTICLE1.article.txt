# FRESHMEN VICTORIOUS.
## Sophomores Are Downed in a One-sided Contest. — Baby Class Has All the Best of It. 
### 
The first class game was a pitch
ers' battle in which the Freshman
captain fiir outdid his rival from
the Sophomore class. The Sopho
mores were unable to meet Sales's
delivery, making but four hits,
while twelve men struck out. The
Freshmen on the other hand batted
Bush out of the box in the fifth in
ning, and had the game well in
hand before Lewis was substi
tuted.
The majority of the twelve runs
the Freshmen piled up were made
in the first five innings, while Bush
was pitching. Of the three runs
the Sophomores made, one was
earned, and two were the result ol
an error by the firat-baseman. The
victory of the Freshmen was due
almost entirely to the speed and
excellent control of Sales, who
pitched unusually good ball during
the seven innings played.
The official score is appended:
