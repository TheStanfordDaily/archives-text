The Junior Prom committee
should consider well before decid
ing to increase the charge for in
vitations to their dance. Their
reasons for concluding that there
will he an overcrowded house are
somewhat overdrawn. Even if
there was such a danger, it is ques
tionable whether the increased
charge of admission would have
any appreciable effect toward
remedying the evil. Most of the
men would pay the increased
amount —or even more, if it were
demanded; indeed many of them
must, for this is one of the few op
portunities they have for repaying
the social courtesies that have been
extended to them during the se
mester. The fact that two of the
class dances have been abolished
makes thin necessity even more
binding. It should be remembered,
too, that there are other expenses
to l>e met in connection with the
dance that fall heavily upon the
average college student. On gen
eral principles the expenses of these
dances should bekeptdown. They
are college dances, and the aim
should be to enable as many stu
dents as possible to attend them
without unnecessary sacrifices.
