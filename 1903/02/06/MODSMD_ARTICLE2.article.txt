# On the Track.
## 
### 
Crawford, who has been doing
well with the hammer all year,
made a throw of 141 feet Wednes
day night. 10. A. Smith, '03, who
hats won points in the quarter-mile
for three years and last year made
first place, is out doing active
training. This assures Stanford
live points more in the coming
meet.
The coming of ''Hilly" McLeod
has given a new impetus to track
work. Jn spite of the rain and
cold weather, the men are suffering
hut little from sore muscles. There
is at present no rubhing list, but
last year's point winners are given
preference. The rubbing-room on
the oval has been fitted up with
benches and a stove.
