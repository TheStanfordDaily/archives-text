A representative list of Stanford
writers appears on the cover of the
current number of the Sequoia.
Irene A. Wright contributes an in
stallment of the "Stanford Year,"
which is perhaps the best of an in
teresting series. R. E. Renaud has
a story, "Into the Day,"and a
strong sonnet, "The Master Instru
ment." H. F. Coolidge's story en
titled "On the Grade" is well worth
a second reading. "The Problem,"
by Mabel H. Brown, "Consecra
tion," by Mrs. Truesdell, and"The
Drifters," by Forest Bailey, make
up the features in verse.
