The Chaparral appeared today
with the usual supply of good
things. Jokes predominate in this
number, the busmen receiving par
ticular attention. There is also a
full-page, drawing by Miss Well
man entitled "Opulent Old Age,
the Busman's Delight." In verse
there is a clever parody, "Wail,
Berkeley, Wail !" Editorially there
are some pertinent remarks con
cerning politics and other matters.
