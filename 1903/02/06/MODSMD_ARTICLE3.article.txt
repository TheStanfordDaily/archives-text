# STANFORD VS. INDEPENDENTS.
## First Varsity Game of the Season Will be Played on Campus Tomorrow. 
### 
At half-past two tomorrow the
Varsity will cross bats with the
strong Independent team of Oak
land. Manager Ireland has suc
ceeded in gathering a number of
professional stars together and is
sure to put up a strong contest.
"Jimmy'' Lanagan, '00, will pitch
for the Independents and can be
depended upon to hold his own
with Parker. The game will prob
ably be erratic in character, as the
Varsity has had very little hard
practice. Although the infield is
composed entirely of experienced
men they still lack the team work
that is consequent upon continual
playing together.
A hard afternoon's work was put
in today. Coach Swindells thinks
that a few of the rough edges have
been worn off, though much must
still be done before the team plays
well together. The [r rms will line
up in the following order:
VA USITY. INDEPENDENT.

Although the dates for the re
maining class games have not been
positively announced, in all proba
bility the series will be finished
next week. The Freshmen play
Belmont School at Belmont Tues
day afternoon and the Juniors and
Seniors will probably meet on the
campus the same afternoon. The
deciding game of the series between
the two victorious class teams will
be played on Thursday.
