Captain McCaughkrn has dis
missed two of the most promising
men on his team. This lias been
done with considerable regret on
his part, for no one in Stanford will
feel their loss more than Mc-
Caughern. But his stand is for the
best athletic interests of the Uni
versity. That three men will have
to suffer the ignominy which must
inevitably follow their dismissal, is
to be deplored, but nevertheless
such ignominy is richly deserved.
Their appearance on the track, the
acceptance of instruction in their
events and of the time of captain
and trainer, were a passing of their
word of honor that they would not
do things detrimental to the inter
ests of their team and University.
The men who have been ignomin
iously dropped have shown them
selves lacking in the spirit which
goes to make a Stanford man. Al
though no commiseration is to be
expected, yet the fact that both
offenders are Freshmen may be
taken into consideration by some.
Both men knew the attitude of Mc-
Caughern and Moulton; both know
ingly broke training rules. It is to
be hoped that should they remain
on the campus until the day of
graduation that they will have de
veloped a stamina of character that
may atone for the disgrace which
each has brought upon himself. If
there are others on the track team
who in secret are not keeping or do
not intend to keep training rules,
let whatever glimmer of manhood
there is in them force them to leave
the oval at once, so that those who
are trying to make a winning team

out of their material may know on
whom they can depend in the close
competition of the Intercollegiate
meet.
