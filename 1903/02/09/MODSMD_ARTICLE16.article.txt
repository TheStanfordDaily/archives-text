# FAMOUS BOER TO LECTURE.
## Peace Envoy to Lord Kitchener Will Speak in Chapel Tomorrow at 3:30. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 in
the chapel at the invitation of Dr.
Jordan, Adrian Hoffmeyr, of the
Transvaal, South Africa, will speak
on "My Prison Experiences in Pre
toria."
Mr. Hoffmeyr was the special
envoy sent last summer by the Boer
republic to Lord Kitchener at the
time of peace negotiations with
England. The unique distinction
of being the first prisoner of war is
held by him. After his capture
the sentence of death by shooting
was pronounced, but he was subse
quently rescued by General Cronje,
the Lion of the Transvaal.
Mr. Hoffmeyr is a man of unusu
al prominence in South Africa. At
the outbreak of the war he was a
professor of classics in Cape Town
University, and formerly held the
position of justice of the peace in
Cape Calony. He is cousin of the
Premier of Cape Colony.
