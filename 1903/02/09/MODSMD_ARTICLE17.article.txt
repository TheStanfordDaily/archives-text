### 
Mr. Arthur Fickenscher, who will
he in charge of Thursday night's
concert, directed the productien of
Humperdinck's opera, " Hansel
und Gretel," last year, on which
occasion a number of German
folk-songs were sung. Mr. Ficken
scher was one of the soloists and
the jiccompunist for the "Deutscher
Liederabend" given hy Frau Schu
mann-Heinck and David Bispham
last spring. These facts in them
selves should assure him a cordial
reception and a good house.
Mr. J. A. Fuller-Matland, a
former English musical critic, in
his hook, " German Masters of
Music," says the following of
Brahms' " Liebeslieder " :
" They are composed in the form
of waltzes, and though written
away from Vienna (where Brahms
resided during the latter part of
his life) may well have been a re
flection of the most characteristic
popular music of the Austrian cap
ital. Brahms employs in these
Lieder the piano duet, but in asso
ciation with four solo voices, a com
bination which Schumann was the
first to use in his Spanische Lieder
buch. While the less cultivated
amateur may enjoy these Lieder in
his own way, the musician wonders
at the skill with which thfl vocal
and instrumental parts are inter
woven, and at the amount of in
terest and real dramatic value these
pieces have, for all their popular
guise. They belong to the most
beautiful musical inspirations in
existence, with plenty of romantic
sentiment and playful humor in
them; and their enormous popular
ity need not be wondered at."
