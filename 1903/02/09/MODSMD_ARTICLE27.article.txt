It is unfortunate that we have in
our midst students who, having
ability, do not possess sufficient
college spirit to contribute their
efforts toward the success of our
athletic teams.
At a meeting of the track candi
dates which was held the first of
the semester, the season's policy
was carefully outlined and the
necessity for hard and consistent
training was strongly impressed
upon every one present.
It is my imention to publish the
names of candidates that are
dropped for violating training
rules. Thus the need of this com
munication. I have dropped Ches
ter Ball and Frank Abbott for vio
lating these rules.
