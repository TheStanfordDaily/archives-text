## Dr. Newton Preached on "The Pulpit.“ -Second Address on "Religion“ by Chaplain Gardner. 
### 
Dr. Heber Newton yesterday
preached the second of his series of
sermons on the fundamental ob
jects of the church as features of
worship. was"The
Pulpit" and his sermon was a prac
tical exposition of the minister's
function in the church and his re
lation to the congregation.
"One feature of the church's mis
sion is that of teaching, and it was
as teachers that the Lord's apostles
were sent among men. Even our
Lord Himself in the opening of
His ministry claimed this function
of teacher as part of His mission,
and the older Jewish idea of the
coming Messiah was that of a great
teacher rather than of king or of
ruler.
"The authority with which the
minister speaks is not of his own
mind and character, merely or
principally; his voice is one of
authority because through him
speaks the wisdom of all ages. The
Bible is the word of God, as it re
verberates the echo of the word of
living man concerning the prob
lems, the duties, the aspirations of
human life. The minister speaks
with authority because back of him
is the revelation of man and of
God, in the concensus of wisdom
of the vvisest and best of men of all
ages. In this sense the pulpit
brings a message from God.
"The pulpit exists to provide a
key for the solution of the problems
of human life. The man of the
world often says with great show of
virtue that politics and worldly
concerns have no business in the
pulpit. But the pulpit cannot
shrink from any field of duty.
Wherever moral issues are raised,
wherever moral principles are in
volved, wherein matters of busi
ness, of politics, or of our private
life are concerned, the voice of the
pulpit should be heard. Its task
is to hold up the ideals of life above
the level of custom and convention
ality. The Christian church is
founded for the ministry of man.
One of its cornerstones is the
pulpit."
Rev. Gardner spoke in the after
noon on the subject of "Religion."
The program of music was an ex
tended one.
Mrs. Mary Roberts Smith sang
"The Radiant Morn" by Wood
ward, and "O Thou Afllicted,"
by Benedict, in the morning. The
soloist in the afternoon was Mr. B.
F. Jeffers of I'alo Alto, who gave
two selections, Tennyson's "Cross
ing the Bar" and "Song of Thanks
giving," music by Allisen.
