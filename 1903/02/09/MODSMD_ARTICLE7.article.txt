# JAPANESE TEA PARTY.
## Students from Orient Give Unique and Interesting Entertainment to Friends. 
### 
The afternoon tea given yester
day by the Japanese students at
their club-house on College Terrace
was probably the most unique and
interesting reception ever given at
Stanford. The courtesy and hospi
tality with which the guests were
received was an object lesson for
the student of Oriental customs
and races.
The guests were served with tea
and Japanese confectionery.
Souvenirs of the party, fancy nap
kins, bric-a-brac, sketches, and tea
sets, were given to the visitors.
A welcoming address was made
by Jame Mori, '03, who is probably
the best known of the Japanese
students. Following him Consul
Uyeno of San Francisco spoke as
follows:
"The United States and Japan
have come in close touch with each
other commercially. It is in our
business relations that education
will prove of greatest benefit. I wish
to speak in appreciation of the treat
ment which tlie young men of my
country have had at Stanford
University."
Dr. Jordan in reply said a few
words in regard to the character of
the inhabitants of Japan, their
rapid progress, their future, their
attitude toward civilization and
learning.
The musical features were re
ceived with applause by the Amer
ican guests. The Oriental "koto"
or harp was played with a wonder
ful refinement of touch by one of
the visiting Japanese ladies from
San Francisco. A young man ac
companied her on the "shakuha
chi" or flute. Other music with
the distinctive foreign flavor fol
lowed.
Mr. Shimada, a well known artist
of San Mateo, and Mr. Morita,
who has been doing a great deal of
sketch work for Dr. Jordan, gave
exhibition water-coloring and
sketching. The rapidity and com
pleteness with which Mr. Shimada
did his artistic work was a revel
ation to many of the audience.
For the reception but thirty-five
invitations were given out. This
number included the nine Japanese,
three of whom were women, from
San Francisco. The others were
extended to members of the faculty
and their wives, and students.
