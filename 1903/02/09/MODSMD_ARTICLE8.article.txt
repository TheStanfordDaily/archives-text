# Alumnae Tea-room.
## 
### 
11l answer to the petition of
eighty-eight senior and junior
studentsof Stanford, the Associa
tion of Collegiate Alumnae has
formally admitted the upper-class
women to membership in the tea
room recently established in San
Francisco. The fee for the half
year is fifty cents. Those who sub
scribe for the second half are en
titled to the use of the tea-room
during tlio summer. On every
Wednesday and Saturday hostesses
are present, and a visit to the tea
room at that time is a social
pleasure. At all hours tlie key to
the room may be had of the ele
vator boy and a visitor finds every
thing at hand with which to brew
her own tea.
