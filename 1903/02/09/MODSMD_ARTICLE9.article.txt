# ENCINA ENTERTAINS.
## First Dance of Semester Given Saturday Evening in Dormitory Club-room. 
### 
The second Kncina "at home" of
the year,which was given Saturday
evening by the Encina Club, was
characteristic of Stanford social
life. The club-room had been
made for the occasion to look like
a large parlor. The great lire
place was lilled with ferns, and tho
chandeliers with masses of droop
ing pepper branches formed a
pleasing contrast to the gayly
colored bunting and red Chinese
lanterns strung between them.
Couches banked with sofa-pillows,
and rugs and screens artistically
placed,imparted a comfortable,cosy
effect, while the whole was softened
by the light of the incandescents,
which were wrapped in yellow
tissue-paper. Many of the dormi
tory rooms were thrown open to the
guests,and late in the evening light
refreshments were served.
Although the weather was un
usually disagreeable the attend
ance was large. About a hundred
and sixty couples were present,
about fifty of these attending on
invitation of the club. Excellent
music was furnished by Yanke's
orchestra, which was compelled to
respond to frequent encores.
The patronesses of the evening
were Mesdames Jordan, Branner,
Stillman, Griffin, Green, Elliott,
Cubberley, Duniway, Flugel, Frein,
Adams, Wilbur, Price, Snow,
Searles, Cook, Whitaker, Grant,
Mathews and Hart, and Misses
Ray and Gardiner.
The preparations for the affair
were made under the direction of
C. K. Studley, '03, L. G. Moore,'o3,
E. C. Beach, '05, and Chester Nara
more, '03.
