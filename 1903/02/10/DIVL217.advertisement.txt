TYLISH FOOTWEAR.
FOR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
THOITS' SHOE STORE
WE have placed a large order for Spring and Summer Suitings in imported and homespun
woolens, which are arriving daily. Some very natty patterns have already putin their
appearance and there are more to follow. We will certainly be in a position this year to take
care of the man who is looking for carefully selected patterns, style, workmanship, and fit-
All of our work is strictly guaranteed.
