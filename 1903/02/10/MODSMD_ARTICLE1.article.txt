# CITY EDITOR OF "EXAMINER."
## J.R. Nourse '97, after Rapid Rise in Journalism Receives Promotion on Staff of City Paper. 
### 
Last night Jameslt. Nourse, '97,
began his duties as city editor of
the San Francisco Examiner, hav
ing received his appointment on
Saturday. This is probably the
most important journalistic position
ever attained by a Stanford man so
soon after graduation. He is at the
head of the entire local staff of
about thirty writers and has per
sonal jurisdiction over all the
news of San Francisco, Oakland,
Alameda, San Rafael, and other
suburban towns.
Nourse's rise in journalism has
been remarkably fast, yet few Stan
ford graduates have had a more
thorough or wider experience in
newspaper work. He is now the
youngest city editor any of the
city papers have had in several de
cades. He received his first news
paper training while on the staff of
the Daily Palo Alto. He began
work on this paper as an assistant
at the beginning of his junior year,
and was its editor-in-chief the last
semester of his senior year.
Immediately after getting his de
gree Nourse worked on the Santa
Ana Blade in his home town. In
1898 he went on to the local staff
of the San Francisco Examiner, and
shortly afterward went on the Even
ing Post, where he was about three
years. He did " police" on the
I'ost and had charge of the Satur
day Post Magazine when that was
in existence, and later reported
politics and the last legislature for
the Post. He was copy reader on
the Post when last March he re
turned to the Examiner. He was
in Sacramento during the state con
ventions, writing signed articles to
the Examiner. Later he had charge
of the Oakland bureau and recently
was made chief copy-reader—which
on that paper, means that all the
copy for the issue has passed
through his hands. From that
position he was raised over the
heads of older and more experi
enced men and the post of assistant
city editor to the city editorship.
Nourse is a brother of J. P.
Nourse, '97 teacher of Greek in the
Lowell high school of San Fran
cisco, of J. T. Nourse, '00, formerly
student body treasurer, now a Sun
Francisco attorney, and of P. E.
Nourse, '03.
Other former editors of the Daily
Palo Alto now doing newspaper
work in San Francisco are: A. 13.
Rice, '95, on the local staff of the
Chronicle', J. 11. Timmons on the
Call; Will Irwin, '99, editor of the
Chronicle's Sunday supplement,and
E. W. Smith, '99, coast editor of
the Chronicle.
