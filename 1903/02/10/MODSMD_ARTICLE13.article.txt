# Proposed Tennis Court Site.
## 
### 
A committee composed of Dr.
Angell, Dr. Snow, C. G. Lathrop,
President Dittmar, and Treasurer
Edwards inspected this morning
the land which Mrs. Stanford has
offered in the proposed athletic field
near the new Gymnasium for the
use of a new tennis court. Mrs.
Stanford on Friday consented to
have this land used, although it
was not her intention to have work
done on the field within a year.
The committee investigated the
feasibility of using the alloted sec
tion for the new court under present
consideration. The site is a quar
ter of a mile northeast of Encina,
directly in the rear of the site of
the new Library building and close
to the new Gymnasium foundation.
Nothing definite was decided
upon, as it fs possible that bids may
be received which will be low
enough to allow building 011 the
site.
111 the meantime work on the old
courts will not be taken up.
