The Girls 1 Glee Club should he
commended for taking the initia
tive in offering a prize for a gen
eral college song. With the excep
tion of "Hail, Stanford, Hail," and
"One, Two, Three, Four," Stan
ford's songs are all in praise of
football or of drinking. A new
song is needed of the type of "Fair
Harvard," with words that reflect
thoroughly the Stanford spirit, that
are set to music whose range is not
too great for the average college
Binger. Every man and woman
with ability to write college verse
should lend their energies to the
production of songs, that the com
mittee may have a number to
choose from.
