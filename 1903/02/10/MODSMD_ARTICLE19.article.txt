One of the greatest needs of the
Museum is a guide-book. There is
a Btore of curios and antiquities
which the casual visitor and even
the careful observer never sees and
rarely appreciates. After repeated
visits one finds things of the great
est interest in cases that he has

looked over many times. Few vis
itors know that there is an origin
al portrait of Napoleon in the art
gallery, an autograph check of
George Washingion in the Leland
Stanford Junior room, and several
bits of valuable porcelain painting
in the art galleries.
There are coins, relics, tanagras,
manuscripts and ancient volumes
of vital interest to the classical stu
dent; there are relics of the Califor
nia and Coast Indians which have
interest for the student of Coast
history. In every case are exhibits
which are not only of general in
terest to the public but are of posi
tive aid to the student. The
Museum may well be used in con
nection with the class-room. This
would be possible were there a cat
alogue or guide-book of information.
