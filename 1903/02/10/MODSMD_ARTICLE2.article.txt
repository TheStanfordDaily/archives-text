# Sketched the Snow.
## 
### 
Saturday morning Mr. Noyes
painted ii beautiful sketch of the
snow on the mountain range back
of the University. The point of
view was the summit of the hill
hack of Alta Vista. It pictures the
ridge and the heavy clouds of an
approHching storm. This picture
is an important addition to the col
lection of California scenes which
will be exhibited by Mr. Noves
the latter part of this semester.
