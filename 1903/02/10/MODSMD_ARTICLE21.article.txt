# Carnegie Research Assistants.
## 
### 
The Carnegie Institution of
Washington proposes to encourage
exceptional talent by the appoint
ment of a number of research as
sistants.
The pay will vary according to
circumstances but will not, as a
rule, exceed $1000 per annum. No
limitations are prescribed as to age,
sex, or nationality. The purpose
is not to contribute to the pay of
mechanical helpers, nor to estab
lish scholarships, but to discover
and develop under competent scru
tiny such persons as have unusual
ability. A person thus appointed
will work under the supervision of
an investigator who is known by
the Carnegie Institution authorities
to be engaged in important scien
tific research in a place where there
is easy access to libraries and ap
paratus. Appointments will at
first be made for only one year,
but may be continued.
Applications for appointments
may be presented by the candidate,
or through a professor of an insti
tution of learning. The applica
tion must be accompanied by all
available data regarding work
done, the course to be followed, and
the time for which the allowance is
desired.
