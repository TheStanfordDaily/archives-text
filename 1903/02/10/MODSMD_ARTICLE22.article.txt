# Track Prospects at Berkeley.
## 
### 
Track matters are being widely
discussed at the University of Cali
fornia. It is felt by everyone that
this year the team has to face a
team that is capable of good work
in every event; and in view of the
fact that many prominent athletes
graduated with the class of '02, and
others have left college during the
year, every effort is being made to
encourage new men to come out for
training. It was to enable Trainer
Christie to give his full attention to
these men that Pete Lohman of
Oakland was secured to coach the
baseball squad.
The men who will represent Cal
ifornia in the sprints are Captain
Cadogan, Brown, and possibly
Abadie. Townsend, Ligda and
Hartley will also be given oppor
tunity to show what they can do
in the short distances. Cadogan
has done the hundred in 10 flat,
and the 220 in 22 2-5, hut he is
not now considered up to form.
Brown is a 10-2 man, with no rec
ord in the 220. Abadie run the
hundred at the Mott Haven meet
at New Haven last year, his lime
being a shade under 10-1.
In the quarter are Hartley,
Ligda, Adler, and Howard. Ligda
lias done 52-4, winning in the In
tercollegiate two years ago, but he
failed to make a place last year.
Hartley is rated at 52 flat, Adler
at 54 1-5, and Howard at 55.
Graves has a record of 2:07 3-5
in the half-mile, and Edwards has
dune it in 2:11. The distance races
will be run by Woods, Hack ley,
Tibbetts, and Kedewell. Woods is
good in both the mile and two-mile
covering the mile in 4:48; while
Hackley does it in 4:44. Neither
of these men made a place last
year. Tibbetts holds the Inter
collegiate record of 10:25 in the
two-mile run. Kedewell won the
mile last year, and is sure of mak
ing a good showing.
Wilcox is the only promising
man in the pole-vault. He won
first in last year's meet and is able
to do 10 feet 8. Geary and Synines
are the other candidates.
Fautz, who won third place in
the shot-put, is the only one who
has shown any marked ability in
that line. In the hammer-throw
Anriear is doing 115 feet, and he is
the only man who has yet shown
up.
