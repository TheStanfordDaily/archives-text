# The
						Winter Route East.
## 
### 
An erroneous impression prevails
that because the Rocky Mountains
have a high elevation, the winter
climate is cold and snowy. The
fact is, the average precipitation of
moisture during the entire year is
less than fifteen inches, and danger
from snow blockades on the rail
roads very slight. This is especi
ally true of the Denver & Rio
Grande, over which system travel
has gone with less interruption for
the past ten winters than upon the
majority of lines popularly sup
posed to be free from such delays.
Old Winter but adds to the ma
jestic beauty of the mountain scen
ery along the way. It brings no
fear nor discomfort to the traveler
on the "Scenic Line of the World."
Our personally conducted daily
excursions are operated all the year
round and are cheap and comfort
able means of reaching all parts of
the East.
Write for lowest rates of fare and
illustrated books. Full informa
tion about the best way to travel.
