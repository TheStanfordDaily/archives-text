# On the Track.
## 
### 
The track men have been handi
capped in their work for the last
two weeks on account of the bad
state of the track. The lower end
of the oval is unfit for use, and the
whole track is so soft that running
on it is hard work for the men.
The only men who are able to work
directly at their events are the
weight men; Crawford, the two
Hydes, Estes, and Weller are doing
good work. The sprinters and
runners are practicing going off the
mark; the pistol is kept going all
day. There will be probably three
thousand cartridges lired before the
Cardinal men get on the mark
with Berkeley.
The men are being worked hard
in spite of the poor track. Mc-
Leod, the rubber, is conscientiously
trying to attend to all the men.
As soon as trials begin to be run
off the good men will forge to the
front, and the trainer and rubber
will be better able to tell what
needs to be done for each candi
date.
