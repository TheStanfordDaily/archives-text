# SENIORS ARE VICTORIOUS.
## Juniors Meet Defeat in One-Sided Contest. —Little Class Enthusiasm. 
### 
Contrary to general expectations,
the class game ,of hall yesterday
between the Juniors and Seniors
did not prove an avalanche for the
Juniors. The score was Btol in
favor of 1903, hut this is not in any
sense indicative of the ratio of ad
vantage the graduating class had
over the Juniors. With eight Var
sity men, a forecast pointed to an
overwhelming victory for 1903.
That the Seniors did not roll up a
larger score was due" to the excel
lent work of Tritch in the box.
While his control was not at all
times theliest, his delivery proved
a puzzle to his opponents, and very
few earned runs were netted off
him. McGilvray was behind the
bat for the Juniors, Ball doing the
same work for the higher class,
Parker and Roosevelt alternating
in pitching for them.
This second struggle of the class
series was not characterized by any
brilliant plays. Opportunities for
enthusiasm were few. The playing
was marked by the entire absence
of class yells.
The coming graduates started
the game with two runs, and
throughout the seven innings kept
things going.
