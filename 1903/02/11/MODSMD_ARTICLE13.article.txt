The Athletic Committee last
night considered things of consid
erable importance to the Stanford
student body. Perhaps the ques
tion which at this time deserves the
most careful attention of Stanford
men is that of boating. There is a
small number of students and
members of the faculty who are en
thusiastic over the boating proposi
tion. The Athletic Committee did
wisely in putting off action until
the sentiment of the student body
could be made plain. It is with
this end in view that the meeting
has been called for next Wednes
day evening. The meeting is not
for those who are in favor of boat
ing only, but is intended also for
thoße who are against it, and there
are many who have had no chance
to express an opinion. The com
mittee appointed to investigate the
bay shore, of which Professor Smith
is chairman, will during the next
week present through the columns
of the Daily Palo Alto the facts
as they found them. The subject
is open to discussion.
