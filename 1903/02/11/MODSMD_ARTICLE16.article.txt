The men who will speak for Cal
ifornia are Frank Stearns, Max
Thelan, and A. B. Weiler.
Stearns has not entered any past
debating contests at California, but
has shown up strong this year. He
is polished and forceful, and is con
ceded to be the most likely man on
the team. He is a member of the
Delta Upsilon fraternity.
Thelan represented California in
the Intercollegiate debate last year,

He has a graceful and convincing
style.
Weiler appears on an intercolle
giate team for the first time. He
wrote the essay on a subject in eco
nomics that won the Bross prize of
$200. He is a logical speaker and
has a clear head.
