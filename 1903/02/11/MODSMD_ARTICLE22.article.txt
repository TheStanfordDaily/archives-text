# TALK ON BOERS.
## Cape Town Professor Gives Information Concerning Recent War in South Africa. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon Professor
Adrian Hoffmeyr of Cape Town
University spoke in the chapel at
the invitation of Dr. Jordan.
Every seat was filled and a large
number of people were standing.
Professor Hoffmeyr gave briefly
some of the Boer history, and spoke
at length on the misunderstandings
which caused the war with Great
Britain. He gave also a brief ac
count of his own experiences as
first prisoner of war. Professor
Hoffmeyr was not on the Boer side.
The South Africander, as Pro
fessor Hoffmeyr calls him, is both
of Dutch and French Huguenot
origin. The Dutch, who first set
tled in South Africa, were sluggish,
non-progressive, and were hard
drinkers. The Hugunot element
made him intensely religious and
progressive. The Boer is the name
given to those South Africanders
who moved north and formed the
new republic.
The late war was caused by a
strong feeling which has always
existed against the English. The
political relations between the
Boers and the English is a history
of misunderstandings and blunders
on both sides. After the Jameson
raid the Boer and the English pol
iticians both called for war. The
European and American sentiment
seemed to indicate that in event of
war all the world would be against
England. Up to the night before
the ultimatum assurances were
pouring in that millions of men
and money were at hand.
The South Africanders in Cape
Colony, and with them the wisest
and greatest men in the Boer re
public, tried to check the desire for
war, and urged that there could
be but one outcome of a war with
England. The ultimatum was sent
by Kruger in response to a false
telegram, supposed to be from the
war council. In fact the council
had just decided not to go to war.
In response to the assurances
from Germany, Russia, France,
Holland, and America, Â£72,000
were contributed, where millions
were promised and needed. The
Boers had been urged into war by
false promises and dependence on
hollow friendships.
England has commenced im

provements. The railroad from
the Cape to Cairo is being pushed,
rivers are being dredged, and the
government is loaning large sums
of money at trifling interest to the
Boers to rebuild their homes and
get a new start. Free government
similar to that in Canada and
Australia is promised for the future.
At the very beginning of the war
Hoffmeyr was taken prisoner. His
persistent refusal to join them
made him intensely hated by the
Boers. He was several times led
out ostensibly to be shot, but they
could not break his spirit. In the
prison he still acted as professor
and taught some of the officers. He
was also instrumental in aiding the
escape of Haldame.
A reception was held last eve
ning at the home of Mr. Keating
in Palo Alto in honor of the speaker.
It is understood that Mr. Hoff
meyr will speak at one of the Uni
versity Assemblies before the end
of the semester.
