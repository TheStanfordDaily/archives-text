# ATHLETIC COMMITTEE MEETS.
## Basket-Ball Organization Authorized. â€”Report on the Possibilities of Boating. 
### 
At the meeting Athletic
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents last night a number of im
portant matters were considered.
Basket ball, boating, and intercol
legiate agreement amendments re
ceived attention.
Norman Collyer, '04, appeared
before the committee on behalf of
the basket-ball interests. He told
of the work that was being done,
and what its promoters hoped to
accomplish.
The committee decided to author
ize the organization of the basket
ball men as a club, and to permit
them to enter the league composed
of the basket-ball men of the Uni
versity of California and the Y. M.
C. A. teams of Oakland and San
Francisco. The question of whether
the new organization should be
allowed to use the name of Stan
ford University in its official title
was held in abeyance. At present
it is to be known as the Encina
Gymnasium Basket-ball Team.
Prof. A. W. Smith reported the
result of the investigations made
by the committee appointed last
semester to look into the possibility
of making boating at Stanford a
success. Other members of the
committee were Dr. Angell, H. S.
Lee, '03, F. A. Brown, '03, and A.S.
Henley, '04.
Professor Smith explained some
of the difficulties to be met. The
course he admitted was not an
ideal one, but he said it was quite
equal to that possessed by Cornell,
which produces an excellent crew
every year. A boathouse would be
necessary. Two skiffs would be re
quired, each costing about .$250.
It would be necessary to have a
watchman to guard these; but the
gun club, located about the same
place, which already employs a
watchman, agreed to permit him to
guard both properties, the expense
to be shared. The proposition of
access to the course was more diffi
cult, he said. The gun club, how
ever, has been endeavoring to se
cure the extension of the county
road, and it was thought the added
influence of the Associated Stu
dents might bring about this re
sult very soon. It was suggested
also that the establishment of
electric car lines about the Uni
versity at some time in the near
future was not an impossibility.
The Athletic Committee requested
the Boating Committee to submit
its report in writing. It was de
cided to call a meeting next Wed
nesday night of all men who are
interested in boating, to make them
fully acquainted with the situa
tion.
The report of Chairman Hoover
of the Intercollegiate Athletic
Committee was submitted. It
dealt with the matters that were
considered at the recent meeting in
San Francisco. The Stanford rep
resentatives were the proposers of
all the amendments to. rules that
were suggested. Four minor
amendments were adopted, and
action on the others was postponed.
The question of how the mile relay

race shall be run was discussed, but
no conclusion was arrived at. One
important measure proposed by
Stanford, Berkeley absolutely re
fused to consider. This was that
each university should enter no
more than four men in each event.
In the past the large number of
men has resulted in unfortunate
"pocketing." The Berkeley dele
gates, however, would not consent
to any limitation of the number of
entries, holding that there was al
ways a possibility of a "dark horse"
winning out.
