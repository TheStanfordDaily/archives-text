Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I wish to say to those gentlemen
and ladies who composed the choir
and sang so beautifully on Dedica
tion Day that I cannot express all
I felt on that to me Holy Day, but
I was very glad that you were so
ready and willing to aid and help
in making the service impressive
and memorable by your wonderful
singing. Jank L. Stanford.
