# FINAL CLASS GAME.
## Freshmen and Seniors Will Fight for Championship of Series Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
The deciding game of the intei
class {series will be played 011 the
campus at 3:30 tomorrow. It will
he the youngest class against the
oldest, Freshmen and Seniors hav
ing defeated Sophomores and
Juniors, 12 to 3 and 8 to 1, respec
tively.
Although the prospect of a
Freshman victory is extremely
small, yet there is a probability
that the game will be close enough
to be interesting. The Freshmen
play well together, and Sales is a
pitcher of more than ordinary
ability. He should hold the
Seniors down to a small number of
hits, as they have hit him but little
during practice. It is safe to
prophesy, however, that the Seniors
will be victorious, as their ranks
are filled almost entirely by regular
Varsity players. Should '03 win
tomorrow she will have a record of
three consecutive victories, having
won both years since her fresh
man. The Freshmen are encour
aged over the showing they made
against the well drilled Belmont
team and hope to make a close
fight for the championship. The
men will line-up in practically the
same order as before:
SENIORS FRESHMEN.
