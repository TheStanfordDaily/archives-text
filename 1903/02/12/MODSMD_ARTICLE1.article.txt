The ninth annual Carnot debate
takes place in Assembly Hall to
morrow night. The Carnot medal
for individual excellence in public
speaking is annually given by the
Baron de Coubertin, in honor of
the late President of France, Sadi
Carnot. Three representatives from
Stanford and three from California
enter the competition, and the
medal becomes the property of the
successful contestant. The subject
for debate is always upon some
topic in connection with the poli
tics or government of France.
The debate is conducted on the
extemporaneous plan. The general
field from which the question is to
be chosen is announced several
weeks beforehand, and the question
at the final try-outs is taken from
the same general subject. The
definite question for debate is se
lected by a joint faculty committee
of the two universities, and is an
nounced to the speakers one hour
before the time of the final debate.
The choice of sides and the order
of speakers are determined by lot.
The debates are held alternately at
California and Stanford.
Tomorrow night's contest will be
an interesting one. The general
ground from which the question
will be chosen is that of the rela
tion of the government to the
French railroads. The question se
lected at the final try-outs for the
Stanford team was,"Resolved, That
the system of guaranteeing divi
dends on railway investments has
been for the best interests of
France." What phase will be dis
cussed tomorrow night will not be
known until time for the debate.
California will be represented by
Frank Stearns, Max Thelan, and
A. B. Weiler.
Stanford will be supported by
three excellent speakers. The men
who have successfully passed
through the preliminary and final
try-outs and have been chosen from
a list <>112 thirty-six contestants, are
Howard Milton Lewis, Frank
Roehr, and Ovid Herbert Ritter.
Lewis did his first debating at
Stanford last year, when he en
tered the Sophomore try-outs and
was chosen to represent the Class
of '04 in the annual Freshman-
Sophomore debate. As a speaker
his main strength is in a wonderful
command of language and in form.
He speaks with much force, and has
a very imposing physique. He is
a student in the Law department,
a representative of Euphronia De
bating and Literary Society, a
member of the Junior class, and

was recently initiated into the
Delta Upsilon fraternity. Lewis
hails from Great Kails, Montana.
Frank Roehr gained considerable
note as a debater in the Santa
Clara high school. He entered
Stanford with the the Class of 1904
and made the Freshman team that
defeated the 1903 Sophomores in
the annual interclass debate. Roehr
is probably the most logical and
graceful speaker on the team. His
delivery is calm and less forcible
than his colleagues'. He is a Law
major, a member of the Phi Delta
Phi legal fraternity, and of Kappa
Sigma. His home is in San Jose,
where he is connected with the San
Jose Debating Society.
O. H. Ritter debated in his pre
paratory school, and was alternate
on the 1904 Freshman team. He
made the finals in the Carnot try
outs last year, and in the Intercol
legiate finals was chosen to a place
on the second team that debated a
tie with the University of Wash
ington. Ritter is the most enthu
siastic speaker on the team, but his
form is less rounded and polished
than that of his colleagues. He is
a Greek major and a member of
Euphronia. He comes from Stock
ton.
From the three men it is hard to
pick the one who may carry off the
medal. They are all good men,
each having his strong points.
A special train will bring the
California team and their constitu
ents tomorrow afternoon.
The debate will be judged by
Bishop Nichols, Judge Angelotti of
the Supreme Court, and Mr. Van
derlyn Stow, all of San Francisco.
Dr. Jordan will preside.

society Debating League, has ap
