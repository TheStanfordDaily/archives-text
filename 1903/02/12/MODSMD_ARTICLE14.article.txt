Under the express terms of the
Founding Grant, and subsequent
directions by the Founders to the
Board of Trustees, the founding,
endowment, and maintenance of
a university is declared to be "the
paramount purpose of the Found
ers," and it is provided that "all
other directions . . . shall be
deemed incidental and subordinate
to that paramount purpose." The
University founded was made ac
cessible to students of every race,
nationality, and religious creed. It
was accordingly provided in the
Founding Grant and reiterated re
peatedly in the addresses of the
Founders to the Board of Trustees
that the University must be
maintained upon a strictly non
sectarian basis, and the Univer

sity authorities are required not
only to respect the religious
beliefs of all, but to "prohibit sec
tarian instruction." The leading
and subordinate purposes of the
University proper are well ex
pressed in the recent address of the
surviving Founder aa follows:
"While its chief object is the in
struction of students with a view
to producing leaders and educators
in every field of science and indus
try, the University was also de
signed 'to advance learning, the
arts, and sciences'; and to this end
the institution should assist, by
experimentation and research, in
the advancement of useful knowl
edge, and in the dissemination and
practical application of the same."
Believing that truth cannot injure
the cause of true religion, it was
the wish of the Founders that in
the accomplishment of these pur
poses the University should be ab
solutely untrammeled in the dis
semination of truth as it may find
it to be established by science.
Having made provision for a
non-partisan, non-sectarian Uni
versity, in which were to be assem
bled students of many religious
denominations, the Founders, de
siring so far as possible to provide
for the spiritual needs of the stu
dents while they are temporarily
unable to attend religious services
in their several churches, required
that the Trustees should "lay off
on the Palo Alto Farm a site for,
and erect thereon, a church."
The services in the church were
necessarily made undenominational
in character and were designee to
strengthen rather than to weaken
the adherence of the students to
their respectivb churches, and not
such as would tend to proselyte
from one church to another. Pro
vision is made for the administra
tion of Christian services common
to all denominations, but, in rec
ognition of such as may not feel at
liberty to attend even the non
denominational services to he held
in the church, and to make free
dom of conscience and belief doubly
sure, it is provided that "attendance
at religious services shall be en
tirely optional, and no profession
of religious faith or belief shall be
exacted of anyone for any purpose."
Under the terms of the grant the
church is no more a part of the
University proper, and no more
under the jurisdiction of the Presi
dent and faculty of the University,
than the cemetery and private resi
dences provided for in the same
division of the grant, or the arbor
etum, the stock farm, or the Stan
ford residence. It is under the
direct supervision of the surviving
Founder and the Board of Trustees.
It is a convenience offered gratui
tousl} for the benefit of the vast
majority of students attending the
University, who, regardless of sect,
are glad of the privilege of attend
ing its simple and informal services.
