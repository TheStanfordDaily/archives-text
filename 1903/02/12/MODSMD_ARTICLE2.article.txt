Before Club Tertulia at the
Kappa Kappa Gamma house last
night Prof. C. A. Duniway talked
on the much debated question as
to the reasons for the withdrawal of
the French support in Mexico.
He said that the so-called conquest
of Mexico us such did nol exist ex
cept as Napoleon proclaimed it
through the French press. Na
poleon, realizing that every franc
and every soldier was needed for
the protection of interests at home,
ordered the withdrawal of the
French troops from Mexico after
trying to persuade his puppet Max
imilian to save the situation by
abdicating. It was not until after

Napoleon's avowed intention of
withdrawal had been made known
to the State Department that the
United States ordered the French
troops to leave Mexico, and hence
the reasons for the withdrawal of
the French support from Mexico
were reasons over which the United
States had very little control.
A short musical program, con
sisting of a banjo solo by Miss
May Kimball, '04, and a vocal solo
by Miss Mercedes de Luna, '05, was
rendered.
