Miss Octavine Briggs, who speaks
before the Women's League tomor
row night, is at the head of a
unique and successful charity en
terprise among the poor of San
Francisco.
After working some time at the
University of California, she de
cided to become a trained nurse.
She served her apprenticeship in
the hospitals and then with the
Associated Charities. Finally she
took a house at Tehama street
and gave her services as a nurse to
all who were sick or in trouble.
As the work succeeded and she re
ceived outside assistance she associ
ated with herself one and then two
other nurses, and now after six
years work not only are her neigh
bors nursed in their sickness but
Tehama street between Fifth and
Sixth is cleaner and neater,and the
houses better kept.
