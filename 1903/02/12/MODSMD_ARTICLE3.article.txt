# Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
The baseball men had a hard
practice yesterday afternoon. There
was a good deal of attention given
to stick work. Four or five innings
of fast ball were played between
the Varsity and second teams. The
men are all rather weak with the
bat. As this is the feature of the
game to which Swindells is devot
ing the largest share of his atten
tion, a decided brace may be the
outcome of the next few weeks'
work.
