# College Song Contest.
## 
### 
The contest for the prize which
the Girls' Glee Club has offered for
a typica 1 Stanford college song will
close one week from tomorrow.
The Glee Club will not award the
prize unless the song is of the kind
and excellence demanded. Up to
the present time no songs have
been handed in to the committee,
but it is understood that several
are being written.
