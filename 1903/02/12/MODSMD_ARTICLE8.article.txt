will leave February 23d, to take
up his duties. Harter's itinerary
will take him first to the colleges
of Southern California, then to

organization of 37 members and a
Bible class of 5 men, to its pres

Bible classes with a total enroll
ment of 92 men, the nucleus of a
Missionary department, and a
young but active Social Service de
partment. Harter was identified
with athletics up to his senior
year. In his Junior year, in the
Intercollegiate, he made a third
place in the 100-yard dash. He is
at present a member of the Gym
nasium Club. He conceived the
idea of student co-operative man
agement for the Inn, organized the
present club,and acted as president
the first year.
The association work will be
carried on by Herbert F. Coolidge,
'03, acting president, who will re
sign his position in favor of Au
gustive JoneH, '04, upon the latter's
return to the University, for the re
mainder of the semester as general
secretary.
