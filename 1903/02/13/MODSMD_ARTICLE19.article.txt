# SENIORS VICTORIOUS.
## Class Championship Goes to 1903 for Third Consecutive Time. 
### 
After having inflicted a decisive
defeat upon the Juniors, the Senior
team won from tlie Freshmen yes
terday afternoon by the score of 4
to 1. Throughout the seven in
nings there was enough uncer
tainty about the ultimate outcome
of the game so that the interest of
the class partisans did not flag.
Parker and Roosevelt did the twirl
ing for 1903, while Captain Sales
and Colbert opposed them for the
Freshmen. Sales had the best of
it and showed that he will be an
important factor in the race for the
pitcher's position.
Williams crossed the rubber
early in the game on a bad throw
and a fumble. The game was full
of good plays and bad errors due
to the erratic work of men who
have not had consistent practice.
