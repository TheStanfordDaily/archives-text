# STANFORD VS. ST. MARY'S.
## Varsity Will Play First Game of the Season Tomorrow on Campus Diamond. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Varsity
will cross bats with the baseball
team of St. Mary's College, Oak
land. The game has every promise
of being close and exciting, as the
Cardinal players are rounding into
shape and St. Mary's has put a
strong nine into the field. There
is still the possibility of erratic
work on the part of the Stanford
men, as class games and rainy
weather have broken into the regu
lar practice, but experience and
team-work should operate to hold
the men fairly well together. The
line-up will probably lie the same
as planned for last Saturday:
ST. MAKY's. STANFORD.
