# AGREEMENT AMENDMENTS.
## Nothing Done to Obviate Misunder-standing Over Interpretation of the Document. 
### 
The Intercollegiate Athletic Com
mittee has had two meetings this
year, one Friday, January 30th,
and the other last night. At the
first meeting the committee organ
ized by the election of Theodore
Hoover, Stanford '01, as chairman,
and Ezra Decoto, California, as
secretary; Bell, Decoto, and Wool
sey representing the State Univer
sity, and T. Hoover, J. Reynolds,
and C. M. Fickert representing
Stanford.
At the first meeting the Stanford
Undergraduate Athletic Committee
offered for the consideration of the
committee sixteen amendments.
The first amendment wis brought
up with the intention of determin
ing how the relay race should he
run on the California track, the
agreement calling for five men only
and that on a five and one half lap
track. Stanford asked that the
first relay he one and one-half laps,
and the remaining four one lap
each. California wanted half of
the first one and one-half laps run
as the first relay, the other half to
he run hv the same sprinter last.
No agreement could he reached.
It will probably be decided by the
varsity captains before the spring
meet.
Amendment number two, which
called for the limitation of the
number in each event to four en
tries, was rejected.
The third proposed amendment
was withdrawn by Stanford.
According to the fourth amend
ment, henceforth "a university of
standing is defined, for the purpose
of this agreement, as an educational
institution which confers the
bachelor's degree, provided that the
preparatory department of such an
educational institution shall not be
Considered a university of stand
ing."
The adoption of amendments five,
six, and seven were in line with the
attempt of the Stanford representa
tives for simplifying and grouping
together under appropriate articles
the provisions that there belonged.
Amendments seven and one-half
to fourteen, inclusive, were de
signed for clearing away all doubt
as to the eligibility of contestants.
Stanford proposed a method of pro
cedure much like the one now in
use. In case a man was contested
the decision of the faculty com
mittees of both universities should
be final. In case of disagreement
the case was to be stated, certified
to by the two faculty chairmen, and
left to an arbitration committee
from the University Club of San
Francisco. California refused to
accept these amendments.
The last two proposed amend
ments were passed. The two ten
nis managers may select a place
for the playing of the intercollegiate
tennis match.
The last amendment provides a
definite time and place of meeting
of the Intercollegiate Athletic Com
mittee. It will meet "at 8 p.m. on
the fourth Saturday in January of
each year hereafter at the Palace
Hotel in San Francisco."
