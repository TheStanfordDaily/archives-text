The Intercollegiate Athletic Com
mittee has met for the last time
this year and no step has been taken
toward solving the difficulties
which will from time to time arise
over the obscure phrasing of the
Athletic Agreement in regard to
the protesting of athletes whose
amateur standing is questioned.
This was in no way the fault of
the Stanford representative, who
offered a solution to the problem.
This California not only refused
to accept, but failed to suggest any
other in return. As in the past,
Stanford will hold that disagree
ments in regard to amateur stand
ing have to be referred to an arbi
tration committee; California will
hold that the faculty athletic com
mittee of each university is the sole
and final judge when charges of
professionalism are brought against
members of their respective teams,
Stanford to decide concerning Stan
ford players, California concerning
California players. It is unfortu
nate that after last semester's expe
rience a repetition of the disagree
able affair is still possible.
Remarks concerning the attitude
of the representatives of the State
University in regard to clean sport
would come with better grace from
an outsider than from us. But
when the California treasurer de
clares the policy of the institu
tion for which he is speak
ing, and the policy is a long
step in favor of professional
ism, it is time for someone to state

the position of the Stanford student
body. Decoto stated that Cali
fornia would not and never had
portested a Stanford athlete; that
if their desire had been to weaken
Stanford's team they could have
done so a few years ago by protest
ing one of our football men. The
only reason that California did not
contend for the throwing out of
the man referred to was that no
evidence could be procurred against
him â€”this, according to a state
ment made by a member of the
California faculty committee. De
coto's attitude is not becoming an
amateur. As a partisan of clean
sport it is his privilege and his
duty to keep out of intercollegiate
athletics every Berkeley and every
Stanford man who is not, strictly
speaking, an amateur and in the
sport for the sport's sake. On
the foregoing principle Stanford
has acted in the past and will
act in the future.
