age. A good part Of the income is
being put aside evfcij yeaj\jto com
plete the building scheme. That
age is nearly over and we are al
most reiidy to divert the money to
other purposes. We know now the
sort of university that it is going
to be. With an endowment as
great as that of all the Atlantic
seaboard universities except Colum
bia combined, it will never be a
large one. We will never take
more men and women than we can
handle to the bent advantage.
Thoroughness and not numbers
will be the object at Stanford.' 1
The founding of the University
was determined upon by Senator
and Mrs. Stanford in 1884. On

accordance with an Act of the Leg
islature the Grant of Endowment
was publicly made. The corner
stone was laid May 14, 1887, and
the University opened October 1,
1889. That was the beginning.
Everything was done under the
direct supervision of the Founders.
June 21, 1893, the Senator died.
Since that time Mrs. Stanford has
had charge of the construction of
the buildings, and in general the
things that otherwise would have
come under the control of the
Founders.
