Thk introduction into the legis
lature of the supplementary bill to
the Enabling Act marks the begin
ing of the end of the most remark
able epoch in the history of the
University. The day is not far
distant when Mrs. Stanford will
turn over to the Trustees full con
trol of the affairs of the institution.
That she should think such a step
necessary is much to he regretted
by every one who knows her, —by
every friend of the University.
Since the death of Senator Stan
ford her work has been of a kind
that none hut a masterful mind
could have attempted, and the
manner in which she has planned
and carried out her plans is a lesson
in constancy and self-denial, and
an exemplification of the "Stanford
spirit." Mrs. Stanford's last ad
dress to the Trustees contained the
following: "The moving spirit of
the Founders . . . was love of

humanity and a desire to render
the greatest possible service to man
kind. . . . While the instruc
tion offered must be such as will
qualify the students for personal
success and direct influence in life,
they should understand that it is
offered in the hope and trust that
they will become thereby of greater
service to the public." In her self
sacrifice, patience, quiet tolerance,
her constancy of purpose and ad
herence to ideals, her loyalty to the
public and to the University under
the most trying circumstances, for
generations to come will constitute
the greatest factor and example in
the growth and endurance of the
"Stanford spirit." Her work has
been a noble one. Within the last
few months we have seen the lay
ing of a cornerstone and the dedi
cation of a church, but compara
tively few who heard or read of the
exercises on those occasions real
ized the obstacles which she had
overcome; that it was her planning,
her execution — the result of her
whole-souled devotion to duty.
Her work as surviving Founder is
nearly done. That many years
remain in which as a member of
the Board of Trustees she may ex
ercise her sound judgment and
business sense, her courage and
foresight, is the sincerest hope of
those friends of the University who
have watched the growth of the
quadrangle from its conception to
its present state. The members of
the student body extend to her sin
cere thanks in appreciation for the
great work she has done for the
men and women of today, for the
men and women of the future; for
each through her efforts "may go
forth and by precept and example
spread the great truths by the light
of which his fellow men may be ele
vated and taught how to obtain
happiness in this world and in the
life eternal."
