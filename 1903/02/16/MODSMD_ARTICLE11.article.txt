## "The Altar" in Architectual Symbolism. â€”Chaplain Gardner's Afternoon Address. 
### 
Dr. Newton yesterday preached
the third of his series of sermons
on the spiritual significance of the
main features of church architec
ture. His theme was"The Altar."
The altar in the Christian
church stands as an epitome of
that for which the whole church
stands. The altar was prominent;
indeed in the old pagan worship.
It has been displaced in some of
the modern evangelical churches,
largely on this account and for his
torical reasons, but even today in
one of ihe most important of those
churches where no vestege of phys
ical altar is permitted the usual
exhortation to believers is, to come
to the altar."
The altar is the sign visible, the
symbol, of that great, invisible
spirit in which we live and move
and have our being. There was
never altar reared that did not call
for sacrifice, in the sacrifice of the
lower for the higher nature. The
sense of God himself in man has
been a slow growth in -iuunan na
ture; even in the lowest forms of
religious life, the fetishism of sav
ages, the paganism of tbe ancients,
the idolatry of heathen nations to
day, we must recognize as obscurer
forms of that same spirit which
lives in the highest, religious hearts
and minds. Of that constant in
dwelling spirit, that universe un
seen dwelling within the world of
seen reality, the altar is the chosen
symbol. It is a protest against
materialism, not only the common
er materialism which leads to and
flourishes in gross living, but the
intellectual materialism which
tempts our age.
Rev. Mr. Gardner gave the ad
dress at the afternoon service.. His
theme was "Sin, a Hindrance to
Religious Life." "Sin is a reality.
We are responsible for our own
acts. Having sinned, o'Uf attitude
should be that of the Prodigal Son,
who recognized his fault and re
turned to his father for forgive
ness."
The special music for tbe day
had been arranged by-Mr. Scott
Brook. Miss Sue Bird, '03, sang
the solo of the anthem "His
Mercy Emdureth," Stainer, in the
morning, and Mrs. J. E. Birming
ham sang both morning and after
noon, the solos tire Lord
is Mindful," Mendelssohn, "Come
Holy Spirit," Dudley Buck, and
"Abide with Me," Liddle.
