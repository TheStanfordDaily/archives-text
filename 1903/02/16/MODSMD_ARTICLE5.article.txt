# STANFORD DEFEATS ST.MARY'S.
## First Contest of the Season Goes to Varsity.—Playing Accurate and Encouraging. 
### 
The first of the season's Varsity
baseball games resulted in a victory
for Stanford. St.Mary's went down
to defeat by the score of 6 to 3. The
afternoon was ideal baseball
weather and seemed to exert its
effect on the men of both teams, for
the work, considering that it was
an initial game, was of a superior
order. Stanford got her first run
when Brown scored on Cowden's
hit to short center. In the third
McGilvray allowed St. Mary's two
tallies by an extremely wild throw
to second which bounded well into
center field. Knight tied the score
in Stanford's half of the fourth on
Copp's three-base hit. St. Mary's
scored again in the fifth, maintain
ing her lead of one run until the
seventh, the last inning during
which either side scored. With
three men on bases Crawford drove
the ball well into right field and
made the circuit of the bases with
the three men trotting in ahead of
him.
The work of the men as a whole
was fairly encouraging. In the
field they carried themselves well
and took successfully all the
chances that came along. There
was a fair amount of hitting done,
the men seeming to possess the
ability to meet the ball when a hit
meant a run. Although Parker
was wild, walking six men, he al
lowed only five hits and has to his
credit eight strike-outs. The St.
Marys' battery, Flynn and Ryan,
acquitted itself very creditably, as
did the remainder of the team ex
cept for occasional lapses into
erratic playing.
