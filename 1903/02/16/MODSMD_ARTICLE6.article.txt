# STORY OF THE DEBATE.
## The
						Argument and Rebuttal of the Men Who Contested in the Carnot. 
### 
"Resolved, That it would re
commercially and politically ad
vantageous for the French govern
ment to abandon the territorial
monopoly feature of its railway
policy," was the specific question
for debate given to the California
and Stanford contestants at 7
o'clock last Friday night. The
three Berkeley debaters chose to at
tack this position, as also did
Koehr of Stanford, leaving H. M.
Lewis, '04, and 0. H. Hitter, '04, to
support the affirmative. By the
unanimous decision of the judges,
Hon. Frank M. Angelotti, tlie Rt.
Rev. Win. Ford Nichols, and Van
derlyn Stow, Esq., Max Thelan, '04,
of the University of California,
made the most pleasing and forci
ble speech and rebuttal, and was
awarded the medal.
A large number of California
students were present, and Stanford
supporters were there in force.
Shortly after 8 o'clock Dr. Jordan,
who presided, and the six contest
ants came upon the platform.
Their friends on both sides had
been ready to welcome them for an
hour or more.
H. M. Lewis opened the debate
with a three-minute speech in
which he contented himself with
stating the question and defining
the issue, making such explanation
as was necessary for a clear com
prehension of the French railway
system.
Frank Roehr opened for the nega
tive. and in a clear, logical speech
sought to establish the superiority
of the present French system over
other European systems in the
matter of rates, speed, comfort, and
service.
O. H. Hitter for the affirmative
brought a mass of statistics to bear
upon these features, and in both
his opening and his closing speeches
presented a larger number of
clearly rational contentions than
any other speaker of the evening.
The three California speakers
were very fortunate in drawing lots
for the last three places in the
order of speakers. All of the visit
ors chose the negative and pro
ceeded to evade the issue of terri
torial monopoly by substituting in
its place the question of government
ownership of railroads, and on this
familiar ground went easily for
ward.
A. B. Weiler, the first speaker
for California, often "rested his
case" and got more or less tangled
up in his rebuttal, but spoke with
considerable ease and assurance.
The last speaker, C. F. Stern, in
a popular sense, made the. most
taking speech of the evening. His
Mexican dollar story was well told,
