# STORY OF THE DEBATE.
## The 						Argument and Rebuttal of the Men Who Contested in the Carnot. 
### 
"Resolved, That it would re
commercially and politically ad
vantageous for the French govern
ment to abandon the territorial
monopoly feature of its railway
policy," was the specific question
for debate given to the California
and Stanford contestants at 7
o'clock last Friday night. The
three Berkeley debaters chose to at
tack this position, as also did
Koehr of Stanford, leaving H. M.
Lewis, '04, and 0. H. Hitter, '04, to
support the affirmative. By the
unanimous decision of the judges,
Hon. Frank M. Angelotti, tlie Rt.
Rev. Win. Ford Nichols, and Van
derlyn Stow, Esq., Max Thelan, '04,
of the University of California,
made the most pleasing and forci
ble speech and rebuttal, and was
awarded the medal.
A large number of California
students were present, and Stanford
supporters were there in force.
Shortly after 8 o'clock Dr. Jordan,
who presided, and the six contest
ants came upon the platform.
Their friends on both sides had
been ready to welcome them for an
hour or more.
H. M. Lewis opened the debate
with a three-minute speech in
which he contented himself with
stating the question and defining
the issue, making such explanation
as was necessary for a clear com
prehension of the French railway
system.
Frank Roehr opened for the nega
tive. and in a clear, logical speech
sought to establish the superiority
of the present French system over
other European systems in the
matter of rates, speed, comfort, and
service.
O. H. Hitter for the affirmative
brought a mass of statistics to bear
upon these features, and in both
his opening and his closing speeches
presented a larger number of
clearly rational contentions than
any other speaker of the evening.
The three California speakers
were very fortunate in drawing lots
for the last three places in the
order of speakers. All of the visit
ors chose the negative and pro
ceeded to evade the issue of terri
torial monopoly by substituting in
its place the question of government
ownership of railroads, and on this
familiar ground went easily for
ward.
A. B. Weiler, the first speaker
for California, often "rested his
case" and got more or less tangled
up in his rebuttal, but spoke with
considerable ease and assurance.
The last speaker, C. F. Stern, in
a popular sense, made the. most
taking speech of the evening. His
Mexican dollar story was well told,
and his peroration on "money" was
almost perfect of its kind.
Max Thelan in his opening
speech devoted himself assiduously
to the perils of government owner
ship, making a brilliant speech on
that issue rather than on the point
at issue.
H. M. Lewis made his one speech
of the evening in opening the re
buttal. His first contention was
that the territorial monopoly feat
ure of the French system lakes the
railways out of the struggle for ex
istence, removes the stimulus of
competition, and perverts the whole
economic nature of the French sys
tem. This feature of his argument
was not answered by any of the
speakers on the negative, but on
the contrary both Ritter and Lewis
neglected to challenge effectively
the opposition for grafting on their
non-government ownership plea.
Hitter in his rebuttal relied upon
statistics to prove some of his posi
tions, but did not give bin authori
ties for some statements in regard
to the expiration of government
guarantees. These statements were
directly challenged on the points of
fact by Max Thelan, who also neg
lected to cite authority. The whole
was a matter of mutual misunder
standing on the part of Thelen and
Hitter, who were referring to differ
ent guarantees.
Thelen undoubtedly won the de
bate by his able rebuttal. His
initial position on government own
ership not having been seriously
challenged, he had clear sailing

ahead and made good use of his op
portunity. The modest sincerity
of his manner also told in his favor,
when contrasted with the somewhat
o verevident self-possession of his
colleagues and the strenuous attack
of his opponents.
The Stanford men certainly out
classed their opponents as a team,
and undoubtedly argued more
nearly the question at issue, but
the entire audience willingly ac
quiesced in (he decision of the
judges. _______

tive. and in a clear, logical speech
sought to establish the superiority
of the present French system over
other European systems in the
matter of rates, speed, comfort, and
service.
O. H. Hitter for the affirmative
brought a mass of statistics to bear
upon these features, and in both
his opening and his closing speeches
presented a larger number of
clearly rational contentions than
any other speaker of the evening.
The three California speakers
were very fortunate in drawing lots
for the last three places in the
order of speakers. All of the visit
ors chose the negative and pro
ceeded to evade the issue of terri
torial monopoly by substituting in
its place the question of government
ownership of railroads, and on this
familiar ground went easily for
ward.
A. B. Weiler, the first speaker
for California, often "rested his
case" and got more or less tangled
up in his rebuttal, but spoke with
considerable ease and assurance.
The last speaker, C. F. Stern, in
a popular sense, made the. most
taking speech of the evening. His
Mexican dollar story was well told,
and his peroration on "money" was
almost perfect of its kind.
Max Thelan in his opening
speech devoted himself assiduously
to the perils of government owner
ship, making a brilliant speech on
that issue rather than on the point
at issue.
H. M. Lewis made his one speech
of the evening in opening the re
buttal. His first contention was
that the territorial monopoly feat
ure of the French system lakes the
railways out of the struggle for ex
istence, removes the stimulus of
competition, and perverts the whole
economic nature of the French sys
tem. This feature of his argument
was not answered by any of the
speakers on the negative, but on
the contrary both Ritter and Lewis
neglected to challenge effectively
the opposition for grafting on their
non-government ownership plea.
Hitter in his rebuttal relied upon
statistics to prove some of his posi
tions, but did not give bin authori
ties for some statements in regard
to the expiration of government
guarantees. These statements were
directly challenged on the points of
fact by Max Thelan, who also neg
lected to cite authority. The whole
was a matter of mutual misunder
standing on the part of Thelen and
Hitter, who were referring to differ
ent guarantees.
Thelen undoubtedly won the de
bate by his able rebuttal. His
initial position on government own
ership not having been seriously
challenged, he had clear sailing

ahead and made good use of his op
portunity. The modest sincerity
of his manner also told in his favor,
when contrasted with the somewhat
o verevident self-possession of his
colleagues and the strenuous attack
of his opponents.
The Stanford men certainly out
classed their opponents as a team,
and undoubtedly argued more
nearly the question at issue, but
the entire audience willingly ac
quiesced in (he decision of the
judges. _______
