Once more the Carnot medal
is won by a man from the State
University. That Thelan won it is
easily conceded. The main discus
sion if any has been over whether
or not the new extemporaneous

feel that the arguments advanced
by them were but a poor showing
for the months of preliminary hard
work. There is in such a debate a
large element of chance. How
ever, Friday's debate was much
nearer an extemporaneous affair,
as originally intended, than it has
been in previous years.
