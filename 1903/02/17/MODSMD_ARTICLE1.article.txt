# BOATING PROPOSITION.
## Tomorrow Night Enthusiasts Will Decide Feasibility of Taking Up Sport. 
### 
Last week the Athletic Commit
tee decided to call a meeting at
which those who desire to take up
rowing could have presented the
facts as found by the committee ap
pointed by it to investigate the con
dition of the bay front. This meet
ing will be held tomorrow night in
the chapel at 7:30. The members
of the committee, l'rof. A. \V.
Smith, Dr. Angell, P. A. Brown,
'03, and H. S. Lee, '03, who visited
the marsh in January, will make
plain the exact condition of affairs.
The visit of the committee was
timed so that the tide should be
at its lowest point. It was found
that at the Palo Alto Gun Club
house there was a width of water
at low tide that was ample for the
accommodation of shell-rowing
with sweeps, the width being prob
ably about eighty feet. From that
point to the bay the slough has but
few bends, and those easy, and it
affords a very satisfactory rowing
course of from a half to three
quarters of a mile. The slough
opens on the bay, and in time of
still water there is unlimited room
for practice. In times when the
bay is too rough for rowing the
slough could be used for practice
work.
The Embarcadero road needs re
pairs from the point where it enters
the willows till it reaches the old
bath house. It could undoubtedly
be arranged to have the county
put this road in repair. From this
point to the Palo Alto Gun Club
house, a distance of about a quar
ter of a mile, a road would need to
be built. The Palo Alto Gun Club
would probably cooperate in the
building of this road. The time
by wheel, with the new road, from
the University to the club-house
would not exceed thirty minutes.
The representatives of the Palo
Alto Gun Club have offered the use
of their club-house, provided the
expense of the attendant should be
shared equally by the Gun Club
and the students. This would
make locker-room and dressing
room enough, and would be a sat
isfactory arrangement, as the row
ing season would probably only
partly coincide with the shooting
season.
It would be necessary, however,
to put up a rough building which
could be locked, for the storage of
the boats. The right to erect this
building could undoubtedly be ob
tained from the owner of the land.
The equipment, therefore, would
consist of this rough boat-house
and a properly constructed Hoat,
together with two four-oared boats,
with oars and other accessories.
