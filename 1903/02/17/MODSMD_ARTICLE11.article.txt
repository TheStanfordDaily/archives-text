### 
There will he a meet next Satur
day between the Freshmen and tie
Oakland high school track team.
Every Freshman who is out will he
expected to enter the meet. If he
does not he will thereby signify his
intention of quitting training. The
Oakland high school has a good
team. It won the Academic ath
letic championship last year.
Hughes, their sprinter, won the
broad jump in the Academic Ath
letic League, and ran the hundred
in 10 flat in the Bay Counties
League meet. Captain Sheehan
runs the quarter. They have some
good distance men.
The intercollegiate order of events
will probably be followed. A re
lay will be run,though the distance
may he shortened to 220 yards. As
many men as please may enter
each event. The meet will be run
off in an hour.
Three loads of cinders have been
put on the oval. A roller has been
procured and the track is being put
in the best of shape. Much of the
clay in the track will be removed
and the additional cinders will in
sure good straightaways and turns
in all kinds of weather.
Captain McCaughern will en
deavor to bring off a meet every
Saturday morning if possible up to
Junior Day, when the interclass
meet will be held, the last before
the meet with the State University.
There will be a meet with. Ukiah
high school for some class team,
and a meet between the two upper
classes on the one side and the two
lower classes on the other, and
finally a handicap meet. There is
one Saturday unprovided for; ar
rangements will be made for a meet
on that day.
Last night the Senior track men
elected H. P. Kuhn captain. Kuhn
has taken part in track athletics
ever since he has been in college
and has won points for his class in
the meets on Junior Day. He was
prevented from taking part in last
year's intercollegiate meet by a
severe attack of appendicitis. He
was this year's yell leader. Next
Wednesday the Freshmen meet to
elect a captain.
For the last two days the track
men have been running trials. The
cold weather, poor track, and new
ness of the men have all combined
to make the trials slow. As a
whole they are much worse than
those of last semester. A few of
the better trials are: Lovell, '06,
ran the mile in 5:11 2-5, Firebaugh,
'04, did aquarter in McClellan,
'04, sprinted the two hundred and
twenty yards in 24 seconds, Bell,
'05, made 5 feet and 5 inches in the
high jump, L. Lyons, '05, did 19
feet and 0 inches in the broad. The
trials will continue as long as the
weather permits and in this way
the men will get a taste of what is
expected of them at the intercol
legiate meet.
