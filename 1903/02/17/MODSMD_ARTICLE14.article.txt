The class track men are choos
ing their captains. The day when
the classes will meet in their an
nual struggle for supremacy is not
far distant, and there must within
a few days follow an organization
by the captains of whatever mater
ial there is at hand. Captain Mc-
Caughern has decided not to allow
anyone to enter the field meet on
Junior Day who has not done con
sistent training. The class meet
this year will be close, and in it
every contestant will count. It
will be the endeavor of each cap
tain to get out as much new mater
ial as possible, for it is not yet too
late for a man to make his class
team.
