Tomorrow night those interested
in boating will meet in the chapel
in order to discuss the feasibility of
making the sport an intercollegiate
event. There is no question as to
the worth of boating as a sport, or
of the desirability of making it an
intercollegiate contest. The Stan
ford student body treasurer finds it
a problem of considerable difficulty
to keep the expenditures smaller
than the receipts. The outlay
which would be necessary to put
boating on a firm basis cannot be
undertaken by the Associated
Students as a body. The most
logical means for obtaining this
end under present conditions is
through the establishment of an
association which will have in it
sufficient enthusiasm to start boat
ing and keep the interest increas
ing until the student body treasury
is financially able to back it up.
