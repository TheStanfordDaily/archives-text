# SONG RECITAL
## Under the Auspices of the Girls' Glee Club, Thursday, February 26th. 
### 
Considerable interest is being
expressed in the song recital to be
given by Miss Millie Flynn, solo
soprano of Trinity Episcopal
Church, San Francisco, and Miss
May Ferrel, ex-'99, contralto, as
sisted by Mrs. Newton Tharp,
reader, and by the Stanford Glee
Clubs.
Miss Flynn is a lyric soprano,
whose voice has a bird-like quality
which is rare. Miss Ferrel while
in college took part in the class
farces and in most of the musical
affairs in which the students were
interested. For several years past
she has sung contralto in Trinity
Episcopal Church, and her rich,
mellow voice has gained much
since the last time it was heard at
Stanford.
Mrs. Tharp is not an elocutionist
in the popular sense at all. Her
readings have all the charm of un
assuming simplicity, and are thor
oughly artistic.
The song recital is under the
auspices of the Girls' Glee Club,
and will be given in Assembly
Hall Thursday evening, February
26 th.
