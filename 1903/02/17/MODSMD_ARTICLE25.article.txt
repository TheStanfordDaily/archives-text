### 
Now that the Athletic Committee
of the Associated Students has
authorized the organization of the
Encina Gymnasium Basket-ball
Club, and its a filiation* with a bas
ket-ball league to be composed of
the teams of the University of Cal
ifornia, the Y. M. C. A. of San
Francisco, and the Y. M. C. A. of
Oakland, the plans of Director
Chappel are assuming definite
form. A number of games with
the other members of the league
will be played, some on the Stan
ford campus, others on the grounds
of the opposing teams. No sched
ule has yet been arranged, but the
first game probably will be played
in about two weeks. A trophy of
some kind will he put up to be com
peted for by the league teams.
The basket-hall movement was
first inaugurated in earnest here at
the beginning of the present semes
ter. Twenty-three men—enough
for four teams —are substituting
basket-ball for gymnasium work,
playing five times a week. Among
these there are a few who have
played before, and these men have
served as a nucleus to make other
good players. Hard,conscientious
work has rapidly taught the men
the points of the game, and excel
lent team-work is being developed.
The coaching is being done by
Homer Martin, '03, of the gymna
sium. Norman Dole, '03, has been
elected captain.
The men who are substituting
basket-ball for gymnasium work
