# LEAGUERS TO COME HERE.
## San Francisco Baseball Team Will be on Campus for Extended Practice. 
### 
Treasurer Edwards has com
pleted arrangements whereby the
San Francisco League team will be
at Stanford for about two and a
half weeks' practice. The profess
ionals will arrive about March 9th
and will stay in Palo Alto. They
are to have the use of the campus
diamond in the mornings, and for
the first week will probably only
do light work. Later on there will
be contests every afternoon with
the Varsity, but the regular sched
ule of games is not to be interfered
with.
The San Francisco nine is un
usually strong this year, and is
made up of men who have made
reputations in baseball both on this
Coast and in the East. The squad
is composed of the following men:
Catcher, Leahy, of last year's team;
pitchers, Iberg, who pitched on the
Philadelphia National League
team last season, and Whalen; first
base, Pabst, captain of the Atlanta,
Georgia, nine; second base, Burns;
third base and captain, Irwin,
with Brooklyn the past season;
shortstop, Shay; left field, a Phila
delphia leaguer; center field, Lynch
of Syracuse; and right field, Meany
of Columbus, who has a reputation
as a heavy hitter.
An additional game is announced
in the schedule. On Thursday the
Varsity will meet Santa Clara at
that place.
