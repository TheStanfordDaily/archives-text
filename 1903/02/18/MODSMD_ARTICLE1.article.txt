posed of Professors Alden and
Newcomer and Instructor Cook of
the English department.
Eleven stories in all were sub
mitted in the contest, and the
judges were well pleased with the
generally high standard. „ The av
erage was very much belter than it
was last year. Reynolds' story,
"The Redemption p,f Slats," is a
very interesting sketch of student
life at Stanford. A pathetic little
story is woven about a senior who
tried to save a freshman from
flunking out because he devoted
more time to "queening" than to
his studies. The senior loved the
freshman's sister and had promised
to look after him, aiid the way in
which he kept his promise and the
results make an intereeting story.
The story will be illustrated for the
Quad by R. J. Sterrett, '02.
The committee c|id not award a
prize for any of the nine poems
submitted, for it was thought that
none of them camp up 112 to the
standard of those tliat .appear in
the Sequoia; consequently it was
decided that none should be ac
cepted. The Quad management
will call upon various writers of
recognized ability for work.
Delmar Milton Reynolds, the
winner of the prize story, is an
English major, and registers from
Pasadena. He has been writing
for the Sequoia and Chaparral
since he first entered college, and is
now one of their principal contrib
utors. His stories of boy life pub
lished in the Sequoia this year have
been one of its most interesting
features. His writing has shown
much improvement si-nce he first
came to the University..., He was
recently elected an associate editor
of the Sbquoia.
