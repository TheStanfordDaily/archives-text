The fact that the music for the
Senior Prom will be played by the
University Band marks the begin

sentiment toward student enter
prises. This has been brought
about mainly because the Band has
after systematic exertion perfected
itself and deserved the recognition.
The time is not far distant when
student organizations will be de
pended upon to play for concerts,
class dances ami farces.
