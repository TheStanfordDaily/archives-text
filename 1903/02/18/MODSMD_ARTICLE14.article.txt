Thk announcement that the San
Francisco league team is to come
to the campus for practice will be
received with universal approval.
The presence of the professionals
on the Stanford campus for three
weeks offers enviable opportunities
to the candidates for the Varsity,
and although the work for the
Stanford men will be much harder
with the professionals than with
a picked second team, the results of
such vigorous practice will have
their reward in the intercollegiate
contests in April. The objection
has been raised that the presence
of the league team will prevent the
development of a second nine.
However, it must be remembered
that the professionals will not ar
rive before March 9th, by which
date in the past the coach and cap
tain have had difficulty in getting
out enough men to form a second
team. While the visitors are here
the second team men will be given
a chance for regular practice.
