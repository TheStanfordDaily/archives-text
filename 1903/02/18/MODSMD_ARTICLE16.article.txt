# FIGHT BARK-BORERS.
## Method Developed by the Entomology Department Proving Successful at Monterey. 
### 
George A. Coleman, assistant in
the department of Entomology, has
jußt returned from Del Monte,
where he has been demonstrating
to Superintendent Lee, in charge of
the Del Monte grounds, the method
to be used in fighting the bark bor
ers which attack the Monterey
pines. These insects seriously
threaten the extinction of the Mon
terey pines and will have to be
vigorously fought at Monterey,
Pacific Grove, and in the parks
and gardens of the Santa Clara
valley. Attention was especially
called to the ravages of these pests
by the condition of the trees in the
Stanford arboretum, and experi
ments were begun looking to the
finding of effectual remedies. Such
a remedy has been found in the
use of hydro-cyanic gas, which
penetrates to the resting-places of
the insects under the outer bark of
the tree. After repeated experi
ments, a definite method of fumi
gating was decided on, and the work
of attacking the pests at Del Monte
has already been vigorously under
taken. Work has also been com
menced on the Hopkins place at
Menlo Park, and will soon be start
ed in the Stanford arboretum.
These insects are small beetles,
generally known as bark-borers.
The larvae hatch from eggs laid on
the bark, bore into the live inner
bark, and thence burrow about in
such a way as to girdle: the tree.
As many as three hundred of these
larvae are found in a single tree.
By careful use of the hydro-cyanic
gas every one of the larvae in the
tree can be killed. Although this
method is especially adapted for
fighting the pests wher'e they are
attacking a few choice trees, as in
the Del Monte grounds or the Stan
ford arboretum, yet Superintendent
Lee of Del Monte intends to try it
on a large scale in the Pacific Grove
forests.
