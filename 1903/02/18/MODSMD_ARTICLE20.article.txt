### 
Last evening the Class of 1904
elected F. P. Whitaker their cap
tain for the season. Whitaker has
heen closely allied with track ath
letics since he has heen here. Last
year he took second place in the
pole-vault at intercollegiate meet.
Since the weather has become
settled and the track in good con
dition the oval is crowded all day
long. The field men are working
at their events. Better trials are
being run. Dunn did 54 8-5 in
the quarter yesterday.
