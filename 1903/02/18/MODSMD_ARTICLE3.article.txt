# THE 						"INTERCOLLEGIAN."
## Stanford Section of New Publication Will be Well Illustrated and Contain Special Articles. 
### 
Nearly all the material for the
Intercollegian has been handed in
and is now being made ready for
the printer. Dr. David Starr Jor
dan bus contributed a twentieth
century article, and Dr. Angell is
writing for the interests of inter
collegiate athletics. Two alumni
and many students have been work
ing hard on the book, in order to
make it representative of Stanford.
The State University has a large
staff and has been working on its
portion of the book since last
autumn.
The Stanford section will prove a
work of art typically Cardinal.
Every artist in the University will
be represented by several drawings
each. The articles will be mainly
historical and therefore interesting
to all those curious about the build
ing of the University, its customs
and traditions. Intercollegiate
contests, bolh athletic and orator
ical, from the first football game in
1892 up to the last Carnot, will be
dealt with.
One [joint displeasing to' the ed
itors is that so few poems have
been received. In order that Stan
ford may be justly represented in
the poetical line, the contest has
been left open until Friday, the
20th.
