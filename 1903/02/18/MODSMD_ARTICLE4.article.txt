Mr. E. A. Corthell, consulting
engineer for the Argentine Repub
lic, lectured last night to the stu
dents of the University, who listen
ed for two hours to an account of the
economic resources of the Argentine
Republic and of its political his
tory. The lecture whs illustrated
by lantern slides which brought
out the main features of the topog
raphy of the country, its commer
cial relations with foreign nations,
audits magnificent system of river
communication between the sea
board and the interior. Mr. Cor
thell showed that the Parana river
alone, the chief tributary of the
Rio de la Plain, is mere extensive
than the Mississippi, allowing
ocean steamers to ascend from its
mouth four hundred miles and be
ing navigable for vessels of ten
foot draft for nine hundred miles
further.
In 1899 Mr. Corthell was recom
mended by our government to Ar
gentine as an engineer, and he is
now at the head of the Republic's
extensive system of river and har
bor improvements.
Mr. Corthell today addressed
