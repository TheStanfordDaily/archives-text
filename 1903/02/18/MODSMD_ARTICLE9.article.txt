# Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
The baseball men were kept
hard at work yesterday afternoon
and were able to get the full bene
fit of yesterday's fine baseball
weather. The usual light practice
before the line-up was faster than
has been the order during the pre
liminary work. The second team
showed up well in the field and
forced the Varsity to work for its
runs. Parker was struck in the
ankle by a batted ball and Roose
velt went into the box, but was not
able to do much with his sore arm.
Both teams managed to bring sev
eral players across the plate. Mc-
Gilvray threw to bases in fine
shape. Ball was caught napping
on third after a three-base, hit and
Stillman fell an easy victim at
third on a false throw to second.
