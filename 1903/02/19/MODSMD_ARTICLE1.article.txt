# ORGANIZE ASSOCIATION.
## Boating Enthusiasts Get Together and Decide to Carry on the Sport. 
### 
A meeting of the men interested
in boating was held last evening in
the chapel. It was called to order
by Fred Brown, '03. Representing
the investigating committee of the
Athletic Committee of the Associ
ated Students, Brown explained
that the meeting had been called
in order to get the opinion of boat
ing enthusiasts on an intercollegi
ate meet, and what they think the
most plausible plan for advancing
the sport. Prof. A. W. Smith, who
was at one time stroke for Cornell,
then gave some suggestions as to
the amelioration of the existing
conditions, as to the water-ways,
roads, and a boat-house, recapitu
lating in substance what had al
ready been said by him at the
University Assembly a few weeks
ago. "The best plan," he said, "Lo
get boating on a sure footing is
through the organization of a club
of those interested in the sport."
He then made an appeal for the
support of those who have any
knowledge of boating.
Talks were made by men who
have already pulled an oar at other
institutions or on other crews.
Among these were P. C. Harper,
'03, It. H. Gaither, '05, C. Nara
more, '03, H. Kuhn, '03, and O.
DuF. Kehrlein, '05.
A motion that a club composed
of all men interested in boating
be organized, was carried. Tem
porary officers, whose aim it
shall be to put the club on a firmer
basis, were elected as follows: P. C.
Harper, '03, president, and It. H.
Gaither,'os, secretary.
President Harper then appointed
a committee to formulate a consti
tution and look into the matter
more closely, so that a report could
be made at the next meeting.
President Harper with Secretary
Gaither, Professor A. W. Smith,
H. P. Kuhn, and Chester Nara
more will act on that committee.
Money will be needed, and methods
for raising it will be settled upon
at that time. The next meeting
will be held in the chapel Wednes
day, February 25th, at 7:30.
