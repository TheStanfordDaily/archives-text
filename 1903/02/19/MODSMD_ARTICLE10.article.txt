### 
Organist Arthur L. Scott Brook
has received notice from President
Jordan that University credit will
lie given for service in the General
Choir of Memorial Church. Noth
ing but the outlines of the plan
have been arranged. It hits been
adopted because of the fact that the
attendance of the members of the
choir has been very irregular and
successful work was therefore im
possible. In the past there have
been two meetings of the choir dur
ing the week and at service Sundays.
It is not yet known whether these
hours will be changed or not.
Credit will probably be given for
singing this semester. The Gen
eral Choir at present is composed
of about nineteen voices. It is the
intention of the organist to increase
this number,but at no time does he
intend it to exceed twenty-five.
