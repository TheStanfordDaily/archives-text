Several of the lines of stationery
advertised by The Bookstore at
reduced rates, have been closed out.
Palo Alto people as well as cam
pus people have been laying in a
Btock.

good until Saturday noon, people
who desire to avail themselves of
a twenty-five per cent discount
should purchase at once.

ulty control Bhould be nothing
more than the determination of the
amount of work done by each mem
ber of the editorial board. For
that, faculty control is by no means
essential; the tally-sheets and the
reports of the editor-in-chief and
managing editor should be as au
thentic as the reports of a student
assistant in the gymnasium or lab
oratory.
