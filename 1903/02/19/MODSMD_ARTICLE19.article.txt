# BUILDINGS ARE PROGRESSING
## Last Ground Broken.â€”Completion of Buildings in Outer Quadrangle. 
### 
The work on the construction of
the concrete foundations for the
arcade back of Memorial Church is
moving fast and will be finished by
the end of this week. These oper
ations finish the final link to the
Outer Quadrangle, and mark the
beginning of the end of the work
started in July, 1898. That month
ground was broken for the Library
and Assembly Hall. The spring
of 1900 saw the starting of the
English and History building east
of the Library, and the Science
quarters west of the Arch. Work
did not proceed on the remaining
buildings until the fall of 1901,
when construction of the east and
west arcades was put under way.
The Civil Engineering department
saw the beginning of its home on
the southeastern corner of the
quadrangle in the summer of 1902,
and late in the fall of that year the
Geology and Mining building on
the opposite corner took shape.
The Civil Engineering building
must see entire completion of the
interior woodwork before it can be
occupied, while the walls of the
Geology and Mining building are
no higher than the first story.
The Engineering department will
probably be able to move into its
new quarters by the opening of
next semester, but the geologists
will have some time to wait before
their buildings are ready for occu
pancy. The small building to the
east is to be used for work in con
nection with the Department of
Mining.
It is the intention to de
vote the Chemistry buildings to
geology and mining when the Ge
ology department leaves its present
quarters. In addition there is to
be at the disposal of the geologists
the buildings now in use by the
Zoology department. The rooms
now held by Dr. Branner's depart
ment in the Inner Quadrangle will
make room for the Registrar's office.
It is figured that the transfer can
be made during the summer.
At the present time all the exca
vation for the buildings of the Outer
Quadrangle is done. Stonework is
to be rushed on the remaining
structures, and by January, 1904,

unless something now unforeseen
prevents, the entire Quter Quad
rangle will he wholly completed.
The transfer of the respective de
partments to their buildings in the
facade cannot he made before the
summer vacation, as the completed
structures are embraced under the
same contract as the History and
Economics building, and occupancy
cannot be begun until all the
buildings aro formally accepted by
the University. The vacation
months will see a busy season of
moving, and in September the
classes can start work in the new
buildings.
The contractor of the Gymna
sium has been rather handicapped
by tardiness in the arrival of steel.
Stonework has moved as far as
possible without the steel. The
first story is to move along rapidly
on the arrival of the delayed mate
rial.
Three months are needed before
the foundations for the Museum
additions are ready to receive the
brickwork. About two or three
years time is the earliest in which
these buildings can be finished.
The plans for the new Library
have not yet been given out by
Architect Day. Several alterations
have been made, and this week will
probably see completed plans and
specifications in the hands of the
contractors. When the contract is
awarded ground will be broken at
once and work rushed with all
possible speed.
