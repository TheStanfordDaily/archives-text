# LEGAL STUDY IN ENGLAND.
## Professor Abbott of the Law Department Discussed Origin and Growth of Present System. 
### 
Last night Prof. Nathan Abbott,
head of the Law department, gave
a lecture on the study of law in
England. Professor Abbott's col
leagues in the department and over
one hundred Law students were
present.
The inns, in many ways, resem
ble universities, and their honors
represent college degrees. The
student must stay three years at
his inn, and his entrance to prac
tice as a barrister is equivalent to
the taking of the degree of LL. B.;
while the elevating of a distin
guished barrister to the rank of
sergeant corresponds to the degree
LL. D.
The student lives at his inn. He
spends his time studying in the
library and in a lawyer's office,
and in debating in moot court. In
the moot court he receives the most
important part of the instruction,
as a barrister argues the cases in
court which have been prepared by
an attorney.
The origin of this peculiar sys
tem of study dates from 1235, when
law schools were forbidden in Lon
don. The lawyers moved outside
the city limits, and around the
Temple they built their homes and
the inns.
At first, instruction was rather
informal. The students attended
courts, took notes, and then met
together and discussed the cases.
Later the study became more seri
ous, and a system of lectures,
called "readings," grew up. By
the reading still in existence we
can judge the severity of the study
at that time.
Outside of the ranks of the bar
risters are the attorneys, who pre
pare common law cases for the
barristers to argue in court; the
solicitors, whose province is equity;
and the proctors, who are learned
in civil law and whose practice is
in ecclesiastical and maritime
courts. Lawyers and solicitors are
trained in offices; proctors are edu
cated at universities.
In 1125 the study of civil law
was introduced in Oxford from the
University of Bologne. Oxford
remained hostile to the common
law until the middle of the eight
eenth century, when Blackstone
delivered his course of lectures on
the common law. The hostility of
the rival systems prevented the
spread of the civil law, or any
fusion of the systems.
