# Law Association Grows.
## 
### 
The recently formed Law Associ
ation has progressed with rapid
strides. Already a large majority
of those students eligible to mem
bership have inscribed their names
upon the charter roll. The active
work of organization has been car
ried on by the members of the
council, who have had several in
formal meetings. They have deter
mined upon the preparation of
circular letters which in the imme
diate future will be spread abroad
among the alumni of the Law
school. The Law Association is
already standing upon a firm basis.
