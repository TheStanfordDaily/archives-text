# WILL PLAY TENNIS.
## Faculty Gives Consent to Women for an Intercollegiate Contest. 
### 
The Faculty Athletic Committee
has given its permission to the
women students to hold a tennis
tournament with the University of
California this semester, and the
representatives of the two univer
sities are trying to come to an
agreement of conditions to govern
the match. Miss Irene Hazard,
president of the Sports and Pas
times Club of Berkeley, has been
on the campus and decision has
been made that the meet will come
here at Stanford. The Berkeley
girls objected to this at first, claim
ing that their new Hearst court
was superior, but the objection was
withdrawn. It is probable that
doubles only will be played in the
meet, as it is acknowledged that
Miss Ratcliff, the University of
California champion, is without a
peer in the singles.
This is the first time that
women's intercollegiate athletics
have been considered on the Coast
since 1899 when Stanford, Nevada,
and California had a triangular
basket-ball league which was given
up on account of the unpleasant
publicity accompanying the con
tests.
