# On the Track.
## 
### 
F. L. Turpin was elected captain
of the Freshman track team last
night. Turpin comes from the
Lowell high school, where he in tide
some good records. Last year dur
ing the fall training, in a trial, he
did the hundred yards in 10 1-5 sec
onds.
The track is in excellent shape.
Fresh cinders are being added, and
the roller is kept in constant use.
The trials grow more encouraging
every day. Last evening Weller,
'06, did '21 feet inches, and West,
'00, did 20 feet 4 inches in the
broad jump. Swinerton, '04, ran a
half mile in 2:11. Gay, '03, who
made a third place in the mile in
last year's Intercollegiate meet, ran
the four laps in less than five min
utes. Dunn, the quarter man,
spurted a hundred dash in 10 3-5
seconds.
A week from Saturday will come
the meet of 1903 and 1904 against
1905 and 1906.
