# Avenues to Be Widened.
## 
### 
The small avenues leading from
the corners of the facade of the
Outer Quadrangle to Univeristy
avenue are to be widened consider
ably in the near future. The palm
trees will be reset, allowing room
for two carriages to pass comfort
ably. Since the trees were putin
they have grown to such dimen
sions as to obstruct travel to and
from the University.
