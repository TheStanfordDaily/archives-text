The members of the Senior class
at last know the amount they will
have to pay into the class treasury.
Since the Quad debt was assumed
considerable anxiety over their
financial difliculties has been felt
by wearers of the sombrero. Last
year the graduates had five hun
dred dollars to commence with and
collected two dollars and a half
from each member of the class.
Although the four dollar assess
ment seems large it is not at all
exorbitant, when the conditions
are compared with former years.
The Senior Class with as little ex
pense as possible will endeavor to
make every event worthy and rep
resentative of the class. The com
mittees in control of the Commence
ment activities have been instructed
to cut their expenses as much as
possible. This can be done with
out injury to the events. The fact
that only three hundred dollars in
stead of five hundred will be ex
pended on the Prom does not
mean that the Prom will be in any
way inferior to that of last year or
of any other year. Every cent will
be made to count and nothing will
be wasted. This will apply to the
farce, the ball, and the other events
of Senior Week.
