# LEVIED ASSESSMENT.
## Seniors Must Put Four Dollars into the Treasury Before the First of April. 
### 
The Senior class today, acting on
the suggestion of the finance com
mittee, decided for Senior Week
expenses an assessment of $4, to he
paid before April Ist.
The finance committee in its re
cent meetings has made careful
estimates of the resources of the
class, and figured on the expenses
of Senior Week. Last year's Senior
class started in with $500, and
levied a $2.50 assessment. The
present Senior treasury has about
$50.
