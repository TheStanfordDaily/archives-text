### 
The Science Association met at
the home of President Jordan
Wednesday evening and listened
to a paper hy Astronomer Hussey
of Lick Observatory. Professor
Hussey until 1896 was a member
of the Stanford University faculty
and gave the courses in astronomy.
His paper before the club was in
formal, sketching the present lines
of work being carried on at the
observatory.
Its head, Dr. Campbell, had

planned to lead the expedition to
South America which will noon go
out for a three years' stay in the
Andes above Valparaiso. Its pur
pose is to determine the present
trend of the solar system in the
heavens by the method of spectro
scopic analysis.
A large work now being carried
on at the observatory itself is the
discovery, identification, and meas
urement of double 6tars. For sev
eral years Mr. Atken and Mr.
Hussey have been engaged on this
work and together have already
described over 1200 new double
stars. In addition to this the sev
eral thousand double stars already
known have been reexamined and
all the information known about
them brought together in a mono
graph published by the observa
tory.
Professor Hussey was the guest
of Professor R. L. Green during his
stay at the University, and this
morning left to return to his work
at the observatory.
