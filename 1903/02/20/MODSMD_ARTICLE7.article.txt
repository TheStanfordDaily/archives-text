# DIVINES TO ASSEMBLE.
## Advance Session of World's Congress of Religion to Be Held on Campus in March. 
### 
There will be held at the Uni
versity about the third week in
March a session of the meetings to
be conducted during that month
throughout California under the
auspices of the World's Congress of
Religion, which started at the
Chicago World's Fair in 1893.
These sessions are to be held at
different cities in California, par
ticularly Sacramento, San Jose, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, the Univer
sity of California, Stanford Univer
sity, Pasadena, San Diego, and
Santa Barbara; and in Oregon,
Washington, Montana, Utah, Colo
rado, and Nebraska. The proposed
meetings are in advance of the
great biennial session of the Con
gress of Religion, which is being
Agitated for San Francisco for the
summer of 1904.
These gatherings are the out
growth of the movement begun at
Chicago, and are attended by mem
bers of almost every sect and de
nomination in the world, embrac
ing the Buddhist, Mohammedan,
and Hebrew faiths, as well as
Christianity. Rev. John Henry
Barrows, late president of Oberlin
College, who spoke at Stanford last
year, was the head of the Chicago
congress. Since that meeting, con
ventions have assembled at Boston,
where Dr. Heber Newton delivered
the opening address, and at Nash
ville, Buffalo, and other large
Eastern cities.
A congress, however, has never
been held west of the Mississippi
river, and the object of the sessions
this spring is to sound the temper
of the West as to a Pacific Coast
congress, and if the results are en
couraging, to stir up interest in
the great gathering of 1904 and get
things in shape.
These meetings are in no sense of
the word merely conventions to
discuss or debate religious points.
It is recognized by everyone that
under all forms of religious wor
ship there is a common feeling of
love for humanity, and that the
great ethical, social, and economic
problems of the future may be
better met by united efforts.
There is now in Southern Cali
fornia Dr. H. W. Thomas, for a
long time pastor of the People's
Church in Chicago. He is the first
of the famous Easterners who are
to visit California next month in
the interest of the assembly. There
will follow him soon two members
of the executive committee of the
congress —Rabbi Hirsch and Jenkin
Lloyd Jones, both well-known di
vines of Chicago.
The third Saturday in March
will lie given over at Stanford to
a session of the ministers in this
vicinity. On the following Sunday
it is the program to have Dr.
Thomas and Jenkin Lloyd Jones
speak in Memorial Church. It
may be possible that other clergy
men will be available for that
day.
Dr. Heber Newton is working up
interest at Stanford, while Dr.C. A.
Duniway of the History depart
ment is corresponding secretary.
