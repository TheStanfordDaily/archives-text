# INTERCOLLEGIATE ROWING.
## Harper of Stanford and Roadhouse of California Meet in Conference. Plans for its Future. 
### 
In a conference between Presi
dent Paul C. Harper, '03, of the
newly organized Stanford Univer
sity Boat Club, and President
James E. Roadhouse of the Univer
sity of California Boating Associa
tion at Berkeley, Saturday, it was
definitely decided to hold an inter
collegiate rowing race within the
next year.
A meeting has been called for
Wednesday evening, and the new
club will then adopt a constitution
and by-laws, and discuss plane for
the new sport. With the active
support of sixty-five men the enter
prise can be made a success.
Harper and Roadhouse have dis
cussed the situation from every
point of view, and they are unable
to find any reason why a meet
should not be held. No definite
date' can be decided upon for the
contest now, but it is hoped to have
it come off either in November or
during the Christmas vacation. Jt
is thought that it would be unwise
to attempt anything except four
oared rowing at first, but it is pro
posed to adopt racing with eight
oared shells after the project is
well under way.
The conditions on the Oakland
estuary where the Berkeley men
train are not over-favorable. It
takes forty-five minutes to go from
the campus to the boathouse, and
three hours is consumed in tho
round trip. The large number of
oil-burning steamers in the estuary
makes rowing disagreeable on ac
count of the accumulation of waste
oil on the sides of the shells. At
Stanford the trip to the bay by
wheel occupies about half an hour,
and the round trip can be made in
two hours. The slough is of ample
depth and in still weather the bay
may be used for practice.
At Berkeley they have a boat
house with accommodations for one
four-oared gig,one four-oared shell,
one double-oared boat and a couple
of singles. There are about forty
lockers and a room for a keeper.
There is room for three more shells.
It is proposed by the Stanford Club
to build a house on the slough near
the Gun Clubhouse large enough
to provide room for three shells
and several smaller boats and
equipped with twenty-five lockers.
President Harper baa secured a
favorable option on a four-oared
barge. It is probable that this
boat and at least one other may be
purchased by June 15th, at which
time the boat-house will be ready
for occupancy.
The Boating Association at Cali
fornia is practically under the con
trol of the student body. It has
been organized for eight years, and
in addition to the inter-class con
tests yearly meets in four-oared bar
ges are held with the University of
Washington at Seattle. For par
ticipation in the contests the oars
men receive the varsity emblem as
in other intercollegiate events, and
as soon as a meet is held with
Stanford the association will come
into the full control of the associ
ated students.
