# VARSITY IS DEFEATED.
## Independents Win Out in the Ninth Inning of a Well Played Contest. 
### 
The Independents forged one run
ahead in the ninth inning of Sat
urday's game and won from Stan
ford by the score of 3to 2. Until
the eighth the Varsity seemed to
have the game won. Two runs in
the fifth gave Stanford a lead of one
which she held until the eighth,
when the Independents tied. The
run-getting began in the third
inning when Parker passed a man
to first who scored from third on
Ireland's bunt which Copp allowed
to roll over the base, thinking it
was a foul ball. In the fifth Low
enthal hit to short and went to
third on Goslinsky's error on
Knight's bunt. Lowenthal was
thrown out at home on Copp'sbunt
but Knight scored on Hogan's throw
to second to catch Copp stealing
from first. Wirt hit to the infield
and Copp came home, giving the
Varsity a lead of one run.
In the eighth Lanagan reached
first on a hit to shortstop and got
to the plate on a hit by Devereaux
and a passed ball by McGilvray.
With the score tied in the ninth
Webber got to second on Brown's
overthrow to first and came in on
Brashear's hit past Copp.
Although the game was a defeat
it was far from a discouraging one.
The team held together well in
critical moments and played
snappy ball throughout. At the
bat Stanford got six hits from
Lanagan, while Parker held his op
ponents down to four. Although a
little wild, Parker pitched heady
ball and pulled himself out of
several bad holes.
The game throughout was played
with the best of spirit, sportsman
like and with good feeling.
The official score is as follows:
