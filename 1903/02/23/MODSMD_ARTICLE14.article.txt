The Executive Committee has
decided to lay two tennis courts
immediately, and thereby tennis
men are assured a place for prac
tice. It now remains for the sub
scription collectors to become active
in getting together the money nec
essary to meet the advance from
the Associated Students' treasury.
With the building of these courts
the first step is taken toward con
structing the athletic field which
the training-house corporation has
planned. With this beginning it
is possible that the new grounds
will be in shape even before the
Gymnasium is finished.
