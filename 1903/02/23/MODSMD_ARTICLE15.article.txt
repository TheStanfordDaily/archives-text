Saturday's field-day, the first
of the semester, showed the result
of the few weeks of systematic
training which the men have had.
The races were hard and well
fought, speaking much for the spirit
which Moulton has been preaching:
"He a first-place man; if you can't
get first place, fight your hardest
for second place."
A few men and not more than a
half-dozen women were out to cheer
the runners at the finish. The
track man deserves commendation,
for his work is hard and he takes
more of what athletes call "punish
ment" than either baseball or foot
ball players. Seldom is the stu
dent body at large tfiven the chance
to show its appreciation of his
sacrifice. This is not a plea for a
large attendance at the evening
work-outs, but it is a plea for a
larger attendance at the track meets
which will be held each Saturday
from now until the middle of April.
