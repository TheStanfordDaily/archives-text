# SERMONS ON SUNDAY.
## Dr. Newton on "Ideals of Democracy." —"Prayer," by Chaplain Gardner. 
### 
Dr. Newton's subject was"The
Ideals of Democracy." He took
up the motto of the French Repub
lic, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,"
and analyzed it, defining the liber
ty that is possible in a realm of
law, the equality that is practicable
amid the inequalities of life, and
the essential nature of brotherhood.
He proceeded to point out the
inter-relationship of this three-fold
phase of the ideal democracy; how
liberty, equality, fraternity are each
dependent one on the others; how
liberty is a means to an end —that
end a true equality, and that equal
ity possible only under a living
brotherhood.
"These ideals of democracy upon
further analysis resolve themselves
into essentially religious ideas.
True freedom assumes that man is
a moral being, a free agent. Equal
ity is only possible as man shares
a common nature. Brotherhood is
never attainable, save as the spirit
of love dominates life.
"We can only make men free
from within, by developing the
moral nature. All movements for
social equalization of opportunity
have been distinctively religious
movements. Brotherhood is a mere
sentiment, unless it is a religious
inspiration. It postulates a divine
fatherhood.
"The ideals of democracy in our
modern world are taking on the
character and enthusiasm of a re
ligion. This new religious move
ment which is striving to make
men free and equal and fraternal is
in reality a renewal of original
Christianity."
At the afternoon service Chaplain
Gardner continued his series of ad
dresses on the personal nature of
religion.
"One of the first aids," he said,
"toward the cultivation of this per
sonal relationship is the habit of
prayer. Prayer, both public and
private, is the exercise of the high
est function of man's nature. In
public prayer the Christian com
munity meets in the highest act of
social worship. Private prayer is
the most exalted privilege of a
man's soul. Prayer should be with
the spirit, understanding, and force
of the will. 'I will not let thee go
unless thou bless me,' is the attitude
of every earnest Christian in com
munion with the Father.
"The life of Christ himself gives
ub the token of the position which
prayer is to occupy in the life of a
Christian. In every crisis of his
life he found his sole strength and
assurance in prayer. For the re
fining of man's soul and the
strengthening of his spirit there is
no other way known than through
prayer and communion with the
Father."
