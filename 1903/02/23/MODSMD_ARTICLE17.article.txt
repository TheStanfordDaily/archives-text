# FRESHMEN WIN.
## Score of Meet With Oakland 66 1-2 to 45 1-2. —Weller Breaks Stanford Record in Broad. 
### 
The Freshmen defeated the track
team from the Oakland high school
last Saturday by a score of 66 1-2
to 45 1-2. The field-day was a suc
cess in every way. The records in
all the events were good for this
time of the year. Captain Turpin
of the Freshmen did especially
good work, sprinting the hundred
and the two-twenty in 10 2-5 and
23 3-5. Weller from Ukiah was
the star of the day; he won the
high and low hurdles handily, and
broke the University record in the
broad jump with 21 feet 8 inches.
The old record, made by Merle
Johnson in 1897, was 21 feet 7
inches. Webb, '06, won first place
in the half-mile, and ran his lap of
the relay in fine style. The mile
was a surprise to every one, as it
had been conceded to Lovell, '06;
but Baker of Oakland, in a very
plucky race, beat him in a very
close finish. Estes, '06, had no
trouble in carrying off first honors
in the shot-put and hammer-throw.
West in the broad jump and relay,
Ilenley in the half-mile, and Hay
ward in the quarter all ran well.
The relay went to the Freshmen
without the help of Captain Tur
pin, who was ruled out because he
had already entered two events.
The Freshmen led from the start,
and finished about ten feet ahead
of their competitors. The team
from Oakland proved themselves
gentlemen, and there was no
wrangling or disagreeable discus
sion. Though the Freshmen won
nine first places out of thirteen,
they were often hard pushed.
Captain McCauglier n and Trainer
Moulton were much pleased with
the field-day records made. The
meet was run off in good time; the
only long wait was for the relay,
which was occasioned by the ques
tion as to whether Turpin was to
enter the event or not.
