## Executive Committee Decides to Put Down Two Instead of Oneâ€”Work to be Rushed. 
### 
Friday President Dittmar act
ing for the Executive Commit
tee, closed a contract for the lay
ing of another tennis court in the
grounds lately selected in front of
Encina.
Goodman, whose hid for one
court for $496, has agreed to lay
two courts for $950. The two
courts will now be hurried to com
pletion.
The construction calls for exca
vation to a depth of one foot. The
removed earth will then be tamp
ed back into place, making the
most solid foundation possible.
Over this will be spread two inches
of sand or cinders, and then will
come three inches of crushed rock,
which is to be compacted and roll
ed by a five-ton roller. The whole
is to be covered with an inch and
a half of bitumen.
The substitution of crushed rock
for concrete was made after due
consultation with several of the en
gineering professors. It is their
belief that the crushed rock will
answer every purpose. Thereby
the cost of construction was lessen
ed so that the laying of two courts
was made possible.
