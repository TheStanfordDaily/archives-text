# Hoffmeyr's Lecture.

### 
Dr. Adrian Hoffmeyr spoke to an
audience of about two hundred and
fifty in the chapel Friday on the
"Limbawbe Ruins."
He said: "The walls, which are
thirty-five feet high, tapering from
fifteen feet at the base to twelve
feet at the top, surround the temple
in a great oval. The walls and
sides of the temple are granite and
the floor is white marble. The
temple is a labyrinth at the head
of which is a tower fifty feet high
and the same in circumference.
"Below the ruins are several gold
mines so old that the timbers are
petrified. On the top of the hill
are several soapstone obelisks.
Many arrow and spear heads and
gold ornaments have been found,
but nothing except a soapstone
vase which gives any clue to the
mystery surrounding these ruins."
