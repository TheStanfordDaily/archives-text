# Rubbing List for Track Men.
## 
### 
There are nearly a hundred men
out on the track. The great num
ber of candidates has over-taxed
the strength of "liillv" McLeod, so
that Captain McCaughern has found
it necessary to cut down the rub

bing list. All point winners in in
tercollegiate meets are to be first on
the list. All other candidates, to
qualify for the rubbing list, must at
least equal the following records:
100-yard, 0:10 4-5; 220-yard, 0:23
4-5; quarter, :57; half, 2:18; mile,
5:15; two-mile, 12:00; high jump,
5 feet 2 inches; pole-vault, 9 1-2
feet; shot-put, 35 feet; hammer
throw, 100 feet; broad jump, 20;
high hurdles, 0:18; low hurdles,
0:28. Additions will be made to
the list as the candidates show the
necessary improvement. About
fifty men will qualify under these
conditions.
