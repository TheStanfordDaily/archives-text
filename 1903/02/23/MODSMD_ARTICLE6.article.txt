# Training for Baseball Men.
## 
### 
Coach Swindells has announced
the training rules which those men
who appear for practice on the dia
mond must observe. Although the
list of things that a man must not
do is not so specifically outlined as
in the case of the track men, the re
quirements are of such a character
that they will insure a team of ath
letes in the best of physical condi
tion for baseball work.
