The little book, "On Seeing an
Elizabethan Play," which Elder
and Shepard have just published
for the English Club, has at last
arrived and more than justifies the
expectations which those interested
in it have had.
What strikes the reader at once
as the happiest feature of the book
is the way in which it serves a
double purpose, first as a guide to
the coming production of "The
Knights of the Burning Pestle,"
and then as a little book of perma
nent interest to all who read the
Elizabethan dramatists. This is
possible because the play of which
this is "some particular discourse"
is peculiarly fitted to stand as an
example of "the comparatively
barren and primitive stage of Eliz
abethan days, with its boy actors,
its garish daylight, its intruding
spectators, its simple but merry
music." To visualize the plays of
this period, whether they be by
Shakspere or another, to see them
acted as one reads the printed page,
is thus no small part of our under
standing and appreciation of them.
This the little book helps us to do,
and therein lies its permanent
value. In the introductory essay
Professor Alden divides his matter
under three heads: The Theater,
The Knight of the Burning Pestle,
and the Songs and Music; gather
ing, from such sources as are ac
cessible to scholars, general infor
mation about the theaters, scenery,
properties, audiences, etc., and such
particular information about the
special play as would be of interest
to those about to see it.
The value of this essay is greatly
enhanced by the reproduction of
illustrative material from Eliza
bethan times. Besides the portrait
of Beaumont which serves as fron
tispiece, there are two full-page
wood-cuts of the famous "Swan"
theater, the one showing its exterior
and its position on the "Bankside"
opposite London, the other showing
the interior, as it was roughly
sketched in 1596 or thereabouts by
a Dutch scholar who was visiting
London. This latter is notable as
being the only contemporary pic
ture we have of the interior of a
theater in Shakspere's time. It is
the chief authority, therefore, for
the stage as it will be erected in
Assembly Hall on March 5th.
The most important source of
information regarding the conduct
of the audience at an Elizabethan
theater, particularly that part of it
that wns wont to purchase a place
upon the stage itself, the better to
display "good cloathes, a propor
tionable legpe, white hand, the
Persian lock, and a tollerable
beard,'' is contained in the sixth
chapterof Dekker's satirical "(Jull's
Hand-book" (1 (309), entitled "on
How a Gallant should behave
himself in a Play-house." This,
too, has been reproduced, with its
quaint spelling and vigorous, vivid
phrasing, and to it has been pre
fixed a title page with the original
wording, drawn after Elizabethan
models.

The Elizabethan music which is
reproduced in the volume is an
especially valuable feature of it,
because the original tunes are not
generally accessible, and little is
said of them in the histories of lit
erature. All the songs or scraps
of songs, which are so plentiful in
the play, have been set to music
that we know was used in Eliza
bethan times; and in many cases
the tune actually used with the
words has been preserved. The
best of the songs, to the number of
seven, have been included in the
volume, with the music, which,
through the kindness of Mrs. R. M.
Roberts, has been transcribed in
imitation of the quaint notation of
the pericd. Accompanied, as they
are, with full scholarly notes, and
presented in such a way that they
can be taken to the piano and
played, these songs constitute the
most unique, if not the most valu
able feature of the volume.
The "get up" of the book is most
attractive. The illustrations, the
title-page, the music, the head and
tail pieces and initials, with which
the book is liberally provided, are
all drawn after Elizabethan models,
and, with the rough yellow paper
on which the book is printed, give
a suggestion of Elizabethan book
making. For its artistic features
the book is indebted to the assist
ance of H. R. Johnson, '03, Mrs.
Roberts, Miss K. E. Traphagen, '04,
Miss Anne Scott, '04, J.K.Bonnell,
'03, and Ernest Turner, '03.
Whether bound simply and ser
viceably in boards, or more inex
pensively in paper, the book is
exceptionally pleasant to the eye
and hand, a credit to those who
have co-operated in its publication.
