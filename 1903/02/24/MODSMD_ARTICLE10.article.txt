The leaders in the movement to
ward Intercollegiate boating are
confident that now is the time to
make a start in the sport. Such
an organization must rely wholly
upon subscription, at first. Boat
ing brings in little money and
takes considerable to keep it going.
Yet an active organization, with a
dozen or more enthusiasts at the
head of it will have no great diffi
culty in getting some kind of a
crew into shape. Those who are
interested believe that after the
first race with the State University
Club, the students will manifest
such interest in the event that all
financial difficulties will be readily
overcome.
