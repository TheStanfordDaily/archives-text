# "Quad" Josh and Verse Competition.
## 
### 
The Quad board have as yet re
ceived no response to their request
for light verse, college snap shots,
and joshes. The competition for
the contest does not close until the
final forms of the Quad go to press.
The editors argue that the day is
past when a small board are able
to gather up the wit and incidents
of campus life, and if the annual is
to be entirely representative of
Stanford it is imperative that its
contributors cover the whole Uni
versity.
Valuable features of the literary
department will be an article by
Mrs. Stanford, and a history of
Stanford literature by Prof. A. G.
Newcomer.
The Quad has received from
Bristow Adams, '01, a drawing for
the fraternity page, which is on a
par with his football posters for
West Point and Cornell.
Drawings from college students
must be in before March Ist, and
most of them are still undone.
Unless the editors are able to secure
a great many of them soon, the
book will be delayed in its appear
ance.
The photographs for the Quad
are now mostly all taken. The
work of sending them East for re
production is being rushed. The
entire set of Junior pictures was
sent off Saturday, and the frater
nity and group pictures will follow
in a few days.
