Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Quite a few Seniors luive failed
to return the information postal
cards sent out some time ago by
the Quad. Unnecessary delay is
thereby caused in getting the sta
tistics to the printer. A last chance
is given to those who have not
handed in the information asked
for. Friday of this week the list
will be finally closed.
