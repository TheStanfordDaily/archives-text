# Work on the New Gymnasium.
## 
### 
There are twenty-tive brick-ma
sons and helpers at work on the
brick work of the Gymnasium.
Agreements have been made with
the men so that there will not be
any more stoppages from strikes on
wage schedules. The work is pro
gressing rapidly and the basement
walls will be completed by May
Ist. The floors of the basement
will be cemented and tiled, but not
until the building is nearly fin
ished.
Fifteen stone-masons and helpers
are at present at work but the force
will be doubled at the end of the
week.
The wide avenue between the
Gymnasium and the Museum is to
be surveyed this week. It will be
macadamized and gravelled and
bordered by palms.
