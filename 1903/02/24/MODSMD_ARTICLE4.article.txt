The seven short songs of Dvoraks
"Cycle of Gypsy Songs," to be sung

of the varied emotion peculiar to
gypsy life. In addition to these,
Miss Ferrel will sing two of Mac-
Dowell's daintiest songs, and one of
Chadwick's.
Miss Flynn will sing one of Rob
ert Browning's charming poems,
"In a Gondola," set to music by
i Mrs. H. 11. A. Beach, and one of
Arthur Foote's best known songs.

several of her best readings.
The Men's Glee Club will sing,
probably, the "Drinking Song,"
the rendering of which by them has
! always received applause.
