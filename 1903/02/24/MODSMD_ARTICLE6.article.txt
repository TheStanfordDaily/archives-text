# COMMITTEE SELECTS SONG.
## Renaud and Perrin Produce Words and Music With Distinctive Stanford Flavor. 
### 
The committee appointed to
judge the merits of tlie songs sub
mitted in the Girls' Gl«e Club com
petition this afternoon awarded the
prize to Ralph E. Renaud,'o3, and
Arch Perrin, '04, for the best Stan
ford song. The song is called
"Alma Mater" and combines the
spirit of the football song with the
local atmosphere of a descriptive
song of the type of "Hail, Stanford,
Hail!" The words by Renaud em
body the Stanford spirit, and
Perrin's music is catchy and gives
promise of becoming popular.
The preference was given this
song because it was written to
original music. A song by Mrs.
Mary Roberts Smith, "Stanford in
the Heart Evermore," would have
made the choice a difficult one had
there been music to it.
The words of "Alma Mater" are
as follows:
i.
Youngest of the colleges, we raise
our voice to thee;
Let thy pillared arches echo
clear and strong
'Till the Coast Range flings the
sound across the peaceful sea,
Alma Mater, dearest mother, hear
our song.
CHORUS
Still shall we cherish
Tender love for thee.
Faith that will not perish
It shall be.
Thy banner o'er us,
Thine the love that springs;
With this rousing chorus
Stanford rings.
ii.
Now all life is fair and free, our
blood flows full and red,
Pride of youth is ours to give and
hearts of cheer,
While we sing the Stanford spirit
that shall live and spread,
Through the changeless love of
those who hold thee dear.
hi.
Though thy song and daughters
scatter far and wide away,
Still the old life beckons where
the old quad lies,
When the west is robed in splendor
at the close of day,
In the homeward wandering heart
this song shall rise.
