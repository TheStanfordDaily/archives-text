# THE UNIVERSITY ASSEMBLY.
## President Jordan and William T. Reid of Belmont Address the Student Body. 
### 
Dr. Jordan and William T. lteid,
head master of the Belmont School,
were the speakers at this morning's
University Assembly. Dr. Jordan
spoke of a number of "things he
did not like," and Mr. Reid of
"Stanford as Others See It."
Dr. Jordan said a few words
about baseball rooting. Coach
ing, he said, had in the past
developed into abuse and hoodlum
ism, but he did not believe this
would occur again, for the student
body were opposed to it.
Dr. Jordan urged the necessity
of intelligent student elections.
Every voter holds in his hand to
some extent the honor of the Uni
versity, and in voting he should
always consider who is the best
man from the standpoint of the
University's honor.
The importance of paying student
body assessments and Student
Guild dues was urged. Dr. Jordan
said the Guild was a very impor
tant factor in student life, and
should always have funds available
for the relief of the suffering. If
students neglect to pay, the Uni
versity will be compelled to make
the fee compulsory.
In announcing a meeting to the
men interested in rowing, Dr. Jor
dan took occasion to say that he
would like to see boating given a
good trial. It would be hard to
get it started, but, once on its feet,
he said it would be a good thing.
It was an excellent exercise, and
would foster closer relations with
the State University. Dr. Jordan
said San Diego had offered a cup
if an annual regatta were held in
San Diego Bay.
Mr. Reid's address dealt largely
with the future of Stanford. This
University, he said, has immense
possibilities before it. The stu
dents of Oxford and Cambridge and
of the universities of Europe had to
stimulate them the lives of the
men who had made their colleges
great. Stanford is stimulated
alone by her youthful vigor and
energy. It is finer to create an at
mosphere than simply to live in it;
to live a strong, serene life, rather
than to sit admiringly at the feet
of some strong, serene liver. Stan
ford University is to be successful
according as it stands for culture,
for research, for the broadening and
rounding out of courses to best fit
men for the strenuous life. The
opportunity calls for the fine
strength of the Westerner, who be
lieves in winning rather than in
inheritance. Hut commercial ide
als, Mr. Reid said, are in danger of
supplanting the traditional college
ideals. Science tends to the dis
covery of material things in order
that they may be turned to com
mercial ends. It should not neg
lect research for the discovery of
things that are eternal. Material
success is good, but only as the pre
liminary to better things. The
commercial spirit in the colleges
today is very strong. The selection
of courses, said Mr. Reid, is wholly
determined by the effect upon the
future money-getting ability of the

student. It is the day of speciali
zation in every line of work, and
specialization tends to narrowness.
We are drifting more and more
toward the bread-and-butter stand
ard. The old idea of culture and
thorough mental equipment has
been displaced by the modern de
mand for commercial or profes
sional productiveness.
Mr. Reid urged every student to
broaden his course of study. No
one, he said, should confine himself
solely to science, or literature, or
any other one line of work. He
should seek to include something
outside of it that would broaden
his view. Studies that best fit him
for citizenship, for the rational en
joyment of life, should not be neg
lected. Preparation for the fullness
of living should be the aim of every
true university.
Dr. Jordan announced ,that the
next University Assembly will be
held some day next week not yet
decided upon. On this occasion
the principal speaker will be Prof.
George R. Parkin of Oxford Uni
versity, who is in America in con
nection with the Oxford scholar
ships for Americans established by
Cecil Rhodes.
