## 
### 
Dr. Abbott will give another of
bis informal addresses to the Law
students Friday evening. The talk
will be in the nature of a continua
tion of the address of last week, in
which Dr. Abbott spoke of "The
Study of Law in England." At
that time he touched briefly upon
the different inns around which the
lives of legal students center. Fri
day's address on "Student Life in
the Inns of Court" will develop one
point more thoroughly. Much in
terest was shown in the inns by
those who attended the last lecture,
and it is to gratify this feeling that
Professor Abbott will speak at more
length along this particular line.
