Two years ago the Girls' Glee
Club gave a concert in Assembly
Hall. The audience was not par
ticularly large, and it was rumored
that the majority of those who did
go were incited by curiosity. There
was unlimited scepticism as to the
ability of the organization to pre
sent an entertainment of merit.
But whatever the motive of
their presence, they remained to
applaud. And for a long time
after, the ones who were not there
wondered why their friends had
not told them that the concert
would be worth attending.
The point of which is this: To
morrow night the Girls' Glee Club
is to give another concert. Part of
the program it will supply; for the
remainder, it and the reputation of
the participants stand sponsor.
Natural ability and faithful prac
tice, with good music, have made
the club a chorus of adequacy be
yond question. And besides the
chorus work there are to be other
features in variety, not the least
interesting of which is the initiation
of the new "Alma Mater," which
the whole University will be sing
ing before the end of the week. It
is assured that the concert will
rank on its merits, conspicuous
among the year's musical events.
Into its preparation have gone the
earnest efforts of an organization
which deserves whole-hearted rec
ognition. Those who have given
their energy and time, and have
made the Girls' Glee Club effective
—a club to which it is an
honor to belong—deserve a good
audience.
