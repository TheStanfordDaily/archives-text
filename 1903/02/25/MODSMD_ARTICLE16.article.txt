# Numbering of Outer Quad.
## 
### 
The new Directory of faculty and
students, which will make its ap
pearance on Monday, has a com
plete diagram of the numbering
scheme of the new buildings in the
Outer Quadrangle. The rooms in
the Inner Quad are to remain as
they now are, as will also the Li
brary and Assembly Hall.
Beginning with the History, Ec
onomics, and English building on
the northeast corner of the Outer
Quad, which includes numbers
from 200 to 240, the numbers run
in consecutive order to the Civil
Engineering quarters on the south
east corner; thence to the Geology
and Mining building on the south
west corner; and finally to the re
maining corner in the Outer Quad.
The department of Romanic Lan
guages, which is to occupy the
small building east of the present
English office, includes 240 to 250;
Treasurer Lathrop's office 250 to
260; and the Civil Engineering
building 260 to 300. The Drawing
and Art department is to enter the
small one-story building adjoining
the latter structure; while the cor
responding building on the west, to
be devoted to Geology and Mining,
contains 310 to 320.
The remaining buildings are to
be counted as follows: 320 to 370,
the large Geology and Mining
building on the corner; 370 to 420,
the Physics and Psychology depart
ments on the northwest corner; 420
to 460, the Zoology department;
460 to 500, the Physiology and
Botany building, directly west of
the Arch.
The rooms now extend to 541.
The Mechanical Engineering build
ing, Machine Shop, and old Civil
Engineering department, embrace
500 to 541. The map accompany
ing the new Directory is twice as
large as heretofore, and includes, be
sides the customary chart of build
ings and diagram of the numbering
scheme, a key to the location of
certain places adjacent to the
quadrangles.
