# Will Read Farces.
## 
### 
The Junior Farce competition
cloges at noon Friday. All manu
scripts will be in the hands of the
committee at that time. The con
testants will read their productions
to the committee Friday afternoon
and evening. Possibly, owing to
the number submitted, the readings
may have to be continued to Satur
day, but the committee hopes to
render decision by Monlay morn
ing. The cast will be selected and
rehearsals begun at once.
