# Last Night's Practice.
## 
### 
There were several innings of
fast ball played between the varsity
and second team last night. The
varsity seemed able tq distance its
rivals, although the second team
held together well and except at
the bat played strong ball. Ball
was tried on the varsity infield at
first and handled everything that
came his way. Crawford is hold
ing down the shortstop's position
in excellent shape. He handles
himself well and is doing good
stick work. Four pitchers were
tried out last night, Parker and
Sales on the varsity and Tritch
and Roosevelt on the second.
Roosevelt showed good curves and
good speed but seemed to lack the
necessary control, several men go
ing to first on balls. The varsity
gave good evidence of progress in
the way they worked the hit-and
run game.
