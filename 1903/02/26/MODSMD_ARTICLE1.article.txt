# MAKE THE FINALS.
## Those Who, with the Carnot Men and J.H. Page, '03, Will Try for Teams. 
### 
Dr. Elliott, in announcing the
decision of the judges last night in
the preliminary try-outs for the
selection of eight men who will
enter the finals for the California
and Washington debating teams,
expressed the sentiment of all those
who attended the debates when he
said that the speakers were to be
congratulated on their fine showing,
and that the decision would have
been much easier for the judges had
there been more places to fill. This
means that at Stanford there is a
number of debaters who are up to
a Varsity standard, and among
whom competition is so close that
the selection of teams is extremely
difficult.
For the preliminary try-outs
there were entered thirty-four con
testants, a number of whom ap
peared on the Stanford rostrum for
the first time. Taking this into
consideration, all the speakers did
exceedingly well. The old men
were up to their usual good form,
and showed the great advantage
and improvement that come to a
debater through continued prac
tice.
After a consultation of about
thirty minutes the judges—Regis
trar O. L. Elliott, Librarian Melvin
G. Dodge, and Instructor J. T.
Burcham of the Law department —
announced their decision in favor
of A. JVI. Dibble, '05, R. O. Hadley,
'03, Miss Annette Knowles, '06, W.
C. Maloy, '03, L. H. Roseberry, '03,
A. Sheriffs, '05, M. H. Thorpe, '05,
and A. S. Williams, '03. None of
the successful contestants have been
on any of the big teams. Dibble,
Thorpe, and Williams made the
finals in the Carnot this year, and
Maloy received the same position
in last year's Carnot and Intercol
legiate finals. Roseberry and
Sheriffs entered the preliminaries
for the Carnot this year, while
Hadley and Miss Knowles made
their first effort last evening.
J. H. Psige, '03, who was unable
to enter the try-outs on account of
illness, will be allowed to enter the
finals. The four Carnot men— H.
M. Lewis, '04, O. H. Ritter, '04,
F. Roehr, '04, and O. C. Spencer,
'04 —also will participate in the
last contest. From the thirteen
debaters, the first three will com
pose the Intercollegiate team, the
second three the Washington team,
and the seventh and eighth will be
the respective alternates. The
question in the final try-outs will
be the smne as that to be debated
with California.
