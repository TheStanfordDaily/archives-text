Workmen are grading on the
grounds of the Chemistry building
for an oval grass plot, which is to
be surrounded by. a gravel road,
and for a macadamized road run
ning around the rear of the build
ing and surrounding the Assay
laboratory. A crane and bucket
are being placed in the rear of the
building to handle the ashes from
the boiler-room.
The German chemicals and ap
paratus which were received some
time ago have been inspected by
the revenue officers and are now
being unpacked and classified.
It is expected that the fires will
be started in the Assay laboratory
about the first of March.
