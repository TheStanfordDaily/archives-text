# PLANS FOR JUNIOR PROM.
## Committee Decides to Charge Five Dollars for Tickets.—Decoration of the Hall. 
### 
At the meeting of the Junior
Prom Committee last night it was
decided to set the price of tickets
for the dance of March 27th at $5.
The committee took this action
only after thorough consideration
and in the belief that the increased
charge would he necessary to meet
the expenses of the Junior Day cel
ebrations, which will, it is esti
mated, exceed $400. More money
will be spent in the decoration of
the Encina club-room and in re
freshments for this dance than for
any previous Junior Prom. With
each ticket two Junior Day pro
grams will be given. These will be
complete guides for the different
ceremonies of the day. They ,v iil
be in the form of small pocket
books, bound in red leather, with a
heavy black band encircling them
like the band of a class sweater.
They will be pretty souvenirs of the
occasion.
The committee decided to deco
rate the Encina club-room in Jap
anese style. Walls and ceiling
will be completely hidden by a
mass of Japanese umbrellas,
streamers, plays, and posters; and
Japanese lanterns, illuminated by
electric drop-lights, will fill the
room with a soft-colored light.
Seventy-five dollars will be expend
ed upon this decoration, and it is
probable that the work will be done
by a San Francisco decorator,
under the supervision of Miss Hale,
one of the committee. The lobby
of the hall will be decorated in
green and white.
It was decided to have a San
Jose caterer serve the supper,
which will be laid out in rooms on
the second floor, in order that the
• ower floor may be kept entirely
clear for dancing. In order further
to prevent any crowding, supper
parties will be served formally in
the rooms of any individuals who
care to entertain. This is a new
departure, and is expected to prove
popular. Provision is being made
for three hundred guests.
