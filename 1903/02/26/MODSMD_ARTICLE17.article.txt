Miss Knowlks is to be congrat
ulated upon having made the finals
for the Intercollegiate debate. The
fact that for several years the

represented on neither of the teams
nor in the finals was commented
on in the Daily Palo Alto a few
weeks ago, it being feared that by
long practice it might become tra
ditional for Stanford women to
keep out of Stanford debating. To
Miss Knowles credit for having
entered the contest is due. Twice
in the past teams numbering
among their speakers a woman
debater have gone against Califor
nia, and each time Stanford won.
