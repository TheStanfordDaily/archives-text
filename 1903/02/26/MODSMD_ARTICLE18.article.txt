Several weeks ago a notice went
out from the President's office re
questing that the chalking of no
tices on the quad be confined to
certain limited areas. No atten
tion whatever seems to have been
paid the bulletin. Yesterday morn
ing the arcades were decora ted with
chalk marks heralding a meeting
of those interested in boating. To
day huge letters, larger and more
of them than usual, some of them
on the steps of the Library, an
nounced a basket-ball game in En
cina gymnasium. After calling at
tention to the fact that those indi
viduals who did the work were act
ing contrary to the orders of Dr.
Jordan, it might further be called
to mind that it is against Stanford
tradition in any way to mar the
appearance of University property.
And along this line much might
be said about the man who carves
his name and class insignia on
chair rests and Library desks.
