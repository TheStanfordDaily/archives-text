# CLUBS GET TOGETHER.
## Glee and Mandolin Men Adopt Definite Constitution and Elect Officers. 
### 
At a meeting of the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs last night a con
stitution for the government of the
two clubs, as a combined organiza
tion, was adopted. The new con
stitution contains definite provis
ions as to who shall be entitled
to vote for officers of the respective
chairs. At the same time there was
created a council, composed of the
executive committees of the two
clubs, and the president of the
combined clubs, whose duty it
shall be to choose from lists sub
mitted by the leaders of the clubs
those who shall be members of the
clubs and entitled to take the an
nual Chrismas tour. Thus the
club is put upon a more defi
nite working basis. The council
shall provide shingles to those who
play upon either club or both for
two years.
Upon the adoption of the consti
tution, the two new offices created
under it were filled. Edward T.
Thayer, '03, was elected president,
and C. L. Firebaugh, '04, secretary
and treasurer.
