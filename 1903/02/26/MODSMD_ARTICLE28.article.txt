# TRIALS ON THE TRACK.
## Men on the Oval Doing Good Work, A Number of Good Records Made. 
### 
The trials for this week have
been very encouraging. The men
have all been working hard. The
prospect of meets every Saturday
is an incentive to all the men to do
their best. The meets have the
added advantage of teaching the
men the finer points of the game
which can only be acquired in
competition.
Of the candidates for the broad
jump, A. S. llenley, '04, L. Lyons,
'03, and J. Weller, '00, are doing
over 21 feet, 0 inches consistently.
Moran, '04, who has heretofore
trained for the two-twenty, ran a
trial in the half-mile in 2:11. Ful
ler, '06, a new man on the track,
did 2:11 3-5 in the half. Lyons,
'03, sprinted a hundred in 0:10 2-5;
this was a very good performance
considering that Lyons has been
training for field events only.
Grossman, '04, who got third plaee
in the quarter in last year's Inter
collegiate meet, did the quarter in
53 3-4, seconds, fast time for the
track. S prague, '04, ran the
mile in 5:10; and Kitching, '05,
sprinted the two-twenty in 23 3-5;
Crawford put the shot out 38 feet
3 inches. These records have been
made during the week.
This morning there was a verit
able landslide of surprises. Al
though none of the times were
near the record mark, yet they
were good. F. G. Smith, '05, ran
the half in 2:11 2-5; Gundrum, '03,
did the same distance in 2:13;
Pomeroy, '05, and Barrett, '04, in
2:14. Dole, '05, went the quarter
in 0:53 3-5; and in the high jump
Preston, '04, cleared 5 feet 3 1-2
inches.
Though the records 6et for ad
mission to the rubbing list were
severe for this time of the year, al
ready over sixty men have quali
fied. Canvas to tent the runways
to the high and broad jump and
pole-vault during rainy weather
lias come. The soil in the run
ways dries very slowly and when
wet causes delay and inconven
ience.
