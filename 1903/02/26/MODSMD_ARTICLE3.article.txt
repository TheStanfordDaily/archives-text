University of California Boating

Stanford club in any way possible.

twenty-live lockers, two showers,

float in the estuary, for $450. This
float will cost about $60. To reach
the boat-house a board walk of
over 1000 feet, constructed of Ixl2
planks, which will cost $60, will be
necessary. The laying of the walk
will have to be done by the mem
bers. A small boat to be used as a
tender can be obtained for $50.
The total cost with one four-oared
gig will be $745. Another gig can
be obtained for about $250 in the
city for use in interclass regattas
during Senior Week.
Permanent officers were then
elected as follows: President, P. C.
Harper, '03; vice-president, J. M.
Beach, '03; secretary, R. H. Gaither,
