An opportunity will be given at
the reception tomorrow evening for
members of the faculty and student
body to meet Dr. and Mrs. Newton
and Chaplain and Mrs. Gardner

ciation is not to give an elaborate
function, but to invite the Univer
sity public to Roble in order that
they may beecme better acquainted
with the clergy who are already
well established in their work in
the Church. The reception will
continue from eight until ten
o'clock. All members of the Chris
tian Associations will assist as a
receiving committee.
