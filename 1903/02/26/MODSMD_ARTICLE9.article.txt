# Gets a Library.
## 
### 
The University has secured the
library of the late Mr. Konrad,
chief hydraulic engineer of the
Netherlands. The library is rich
in material bearing on river and
harbor improvements, drainage,
reclamation, and irrigation, and
includes many valuable reports on
special engineering problems.
