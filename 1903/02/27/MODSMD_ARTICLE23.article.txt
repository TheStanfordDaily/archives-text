# A
						SUCCESSFUL CONCERT.
## Girls' Glee Club Gives Recital in Assembly Hall.â€”New Stanford Song Introduced. 
### 
Before an audience numbering
between three and four hundred
people the Girls' Glee Club concert
was given with creditable success.
This is the first time in two years
that the women students have ap
peared in such a concert. The
program opened wilh "The Vine
Gatherers" by the Girls' Glee Club.
This number drew a hearty encore
and the club responded with a
Neapolitan song. The "Tuscan
Duet," by the Misses Flynn and
Ferrel, was a good number. Nev
in's "Oh, That We Two Were May
ing" was given as an encore. Miss
Flynn's solos were particularly
pleasing, her beautiful soprano
voice showing to good advantage.
The purity and clearness of her
tones, as well as her perfect voice
control, made her numbers highly
enjoyable. Miss Ferrel, though
handicapped by a severe cold, sang
very well. Her MacDowell numbers
and"He Loves Me," by Chadwick,
as well as the last three in the
"Gypsy Cycle" by Dvorak, were her
best numbers. "Stanford Red" by
C. L. Firebaugh, '04, accompanied
by the Men's Glee Club, was given
with a vim. The verses of the new
prize song, "Alma Mater," were
sung by Miss Chita Kraft, '03, the
chorus being sung by the Girls'
and Men's Glee Clubs. The new
song met with a speedy and hearty
encore. The program closed with
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," by the
Girls' Glee Club.
