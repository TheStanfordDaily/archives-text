# The
						Kilties' Band.
## 
### 
The novelty of The Kilties' enter
tainment (which consists of band
music, vocal choruses, Highland
dances, bagpiping, vocal soloists,
giant drum-major, boy dancer,
buglers, drummers, etc.) coupled
with the extremely picturesque
kilted costume, has given The Kil
ties a unique position among amuse
ment organizations. All the mem
bers are British- or Canadian-born,
and are practically all graduates of
Scottish-Canadian regiments. The
present tour, which is the sixth,
takes the band from Boston to
San Francisco and return. The
baud has played in almost every
town of any size in the United
States. Their first appearance at

Stanford will be in a matinee
Wednesday, March 4th, at 3 o'clock.
The entertainment will be under
the auspices of the Y. M. C. A.
Tickets will be on sale on the quad
Monday morning.
