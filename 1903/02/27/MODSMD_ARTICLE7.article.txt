# To Beautify with Trees.
## 
### 
San Jose has set apart the tenth
of March as Arbor Day, and the
Highway Improvement Club of
that city has asked Prof. W. R.
Dudley of the Botany department
for suggestions as to the best meth
ods of planting trees along the
public thoroughfares. He has sug
gested that the stretch of road
between Palo Alto and San Jose be
divided into half-mile sections,each
to be planted with a separate spe
cies of semi-tropical trees. The
plan is not for a wholesale planting
of trees, but for a system extending
over several years, which will
result in making the road between
San Francisco and Mount Hamil
ton a beautiful semi-tropical drive
way.
San Jose asks the neighboring
towns to cooperate with that city
in carrying out these plans. The
planting on March 10th will be
confined to a district of one or two
miles from San Jose. Deciduous
trees only will be planted this year.
Professor Dudley made a special
point of the planting of evergreens,
such as palms, sequoias, and gums,
instead of deciduous trees, because
of their perennial freshness and
beauty, but county regulations per
mit planting nothing but trees of
the deciduous varieties.
