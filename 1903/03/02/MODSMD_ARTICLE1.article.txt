# UPPER CLASSES VICTORIOUS.
## Good Races Run in Saturday's Meet. Score Fifty-five to Forty-three. 
### 
The upper classes were victorious
in Saturday's meet against the un
der classes by a score of 55 to 43.
The crowd on the bleachers saw
a number of good races, some hard
fights for places, and some pretty
finishes. Holman, Gay, and Thom
son came down the straightaway
of the final lap of the mile in a
bunch.
The quarter race was a feature
of the morning performances.
Crossman's time, 52 seconds, was
the best he has ever done, and Hay
ward's finish for second place was
strong. All three men went under
53 seconds. Lovell sprinted the
last hundred of the two-mile in
good shape.
The hurdles went to the upper
classmen, Kuhn winning easily
from Weller, who did not do as
well as usual. The work in the
field events was none of it phenom
enal. Hyde made a good put of 41
feet 5 inches in the shot, Crawford
threw the hammer 130 feet; both
men have done and will do better.
Bell's jump of 5 feet 7 inches is as
good as he has done this year.
The broad jump and two-twenty
were not contested.
