In a recent editorial the Daily
Californian has the Daily Palo
Alto saying "that California's
committee is not it favor of clean
sport because our proposed amend
ments were not accepted," —a state
ment which was never made in the
Daily Palo Alto. The only pos
sible premise from which the State
University publication could have
drawn such an inference was from
an editorial paragraph which ap
plied strictly to Decoto's attitude
as reported loudly in the Daily
Californian and in the city papers
through the Berkeley correspond
ents. Decoto was quoted by them
as having said that California
would not, under any circumstan
ces, protest a Stanford athlete,that
it would not be and never had been
her policy to do so, that if it had
been her policy they would have
thrown Slaker from the team two
years ago when there was positive
proof that he had received $85 for
boxing before the Olympic club.
It was these statements which
called forth the editorial comment
from the Daily Palo Alto. It is
not "the essence of pure amateur
ism" to accuse a man of rank pro
fessionalism when there is no proof
to back it up, to declare that even
should Stanford unknowingly play
a man who has forfeited his right
to enter intercollegiate athletics
that California would take no steps
to help Stanford rid herself of the
parasite.
