# ON ATHLETIC AGREEMENT.
## Graduate Manager Decoto of State University Explains Position of Committee 
### 
The Daily Californian of laßt
Friday printed the following inter
view with Ezra Decoto, graduate
manager for the student body of
the State University:
"As I understand section 1 of
article 111 of the intercollegiate
agreement, it provides that in case
an objection to the amateur stand
ing of a man is made, 'the manager
objecting must make his objections
in writing within one week after
receiving the names, stating when
and where amateur standing has
been forfeited, and give this to the
chairman of hiß own faculty com
mittee, to be by him transmitted to
the other committee for investiga
tion and final settlement.'
"The representatives of the Uni
versity of California expressly con
tended (before the arbitration com
mittee in the case submitted) that
the faculty athletic committee of
the University of California, and it
alone, had jurisdiction in the mat
ter of the amateur standing of the
man concerned, and under the
words of section 1 of article 111, it
had the 'final settlement.'
"The University Club arbitration
committee decided that the faculty
committee of the University of Cal
ifornia had the sole right of investi
gation and the right of final settle
ment, with no appeal therefrom;
but in the Smith caße the faculty
athletic committee of our univer
sity had not investigated and de
cided the matter finally, as they
had the right to do, but had re
ferred it to the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation, a custom they had followed
for years, and accepted their deci
sion, which they had no right to
do. Had our faculty committee
investigated the matter themselves,
instead of referring it to the Pacific
Athletic Association, and decided
it themselves, the board of arbitra
tion held thot in that case Stanford
would have had no right to appeal
whatever.
"If the students of Stanford Uni
versity doubt this statement, a let
ter to Mr. Fairfax Whelan, chair
man of the arbitration committee,
will clear up the difficulty, as he
must remember that I asked him
what the committee's decision on
that point was and his reply was
as stated above.
"Now, then, as the arbitration
committee has decided this matter
and the intercollegiate athletic
agreement provides such method of
trial, our committee saw no reason
to depart from an agreement al
ready established and defined by
the arbitration board.
"My statement as to the position
of our university in the matter of
protesting Stanford men, is, I
think, the position of the student
body. We leave the question of

the amateur standing of the Stan
ford athletes entirely to the Stan
ford student body and faculty ath
letic committee, trusting in their
honor and integrity to allow only
amateurs to compete, and on our
part we will do all in our power to
see that our own contestants are
amateurs. Instead of this being a
'long step in favor of professional
ism' it seems to me that it is the
essence of true amateurism.
"This harping and quarreling
should cease. If we have reached
the stage where we think there are
no honest men at Stanford, or if
they have reached the stage where
they think there are no honest men
at the University of California, it
is time all relations between the
universities ceased. For myself, I
do not believe that stage has been
reached, and I believe our action in
being willing to leave to the Stan
ford athletic committee and to the
Stanford student body the stand
ing of their own men is a long step
not toward professionalism, but
toward a true comity that should
exist between the student bodies of
the two universities."
