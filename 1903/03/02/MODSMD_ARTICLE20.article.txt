# READY FOR PLAY.
## Costumes Arrive.—Production Attracting Attention in City and Elsewhere. 
### 
The posters for the "Knight of
the Burning Pestle," announcing
the coming performance at the
"Stanford Plaie-Hous," made their
appearance today. The wording
was done by H. R. Johnson, '03,
and the artistic design is the work
of R. J. Sterrett, -'03. Last Sat
urday the cast of the play held a
dress rehearsal in Assembly Hall.
Today all the costumes, including
those for stage boys and for every
one who appears in the perform
ance, made according to minute
directions so as to conform to the
apparel of the Elizabethan period,
were handed over to the players.
The scenery is being prepared,
and will be ready for the first per
formance next Thursday night. In
this respect the undertaking is even
more extensive than the "Antigone"
of last year, since the cost of repro
ducing the effect of the seventeenth
century stage and playhouse, accu
rate in every detail, is exceedingly
heavy. Rehearsals will be held
every night until the performance
is given to the public.
This play is as laughable to
modern spectators as it could have
been to contemporary audiences.
Furthermore, although it does not
represent such a remote period of
antiquity as did the "Antigone," it
is almost equally valuable to the
student of the drama seeking a
conception of the stage and the
performance as they actually were
at the time when Shakspere wrote.
Nearly three hundred tickets
have already been ordered by mail
for the Saturday morning perform
ance. These have come largely
from the University of California
and from the secondary schools in
this vicinity. In the Sunday Chron
icle of February 22d appeared a
long article on the play as it is to
be given here, extensively illus
trated with photos taken of the
cast two weeks ago. Yesterday the
San Francisco Call gave an entire
page of its supplement to photo
graphs of the play and a cleverly
written article by Miss Sarah Corn
stock. The following aro quota
tions from the article:
"The play that the English Club
gives is called 'The Knight of the

Burning Pestle," and is no lees an
attempt than an old Beaumont and
Fletcher comedy, a play that dates
back to the beginning of the six
teen hundreds, and that the stu
dents are to give literally as it was
given in those early days of Lon
don theatricals, and again in 1635
at the court of Queen Henrietta.
It is rare enough now to see even a
Shaksperean production that in
cludes the prologue and all the
other queernesses of Shakspere's
time. But a play written by
'Frances Beaumont and John
Fletcher, Gent.,' and 'printed for
Walter Bur re and to be sold at the
signeof the Crane in Paules Church
yard'—rendered with full pro
logue, with historically correct
costumes, with the music of that
period accurate to the last song of
Master Merrythought —this is the
most whimsical prank that college
students ever played, and at the
same time the most interesting
study in English literature that our
Coast has ever been fortunate
enough to see. Assembly Hall is
to be the scene of the event. The
preparations are lavish in the line
of scenery and costumes. Not one
detail has been omitted that can
make the rendering of the play of
historical value. And the bur
lesque of the plot has its value
today. It is a satire upon the
common people's manners in the
theater. They are broadly guyed
for the way in which they interrupt
the performance, rooting for the
hero and down-with-ing the villain.
They are shown as following the
plot with such childlike faith that
every person becomes a real person
to be approved or scorned. You
can catch glimpses of the hooting
gallery god and the tearful matinee
girl and the objecting momtner of
our own playhouses.
"The play shows the stage pre
pared for a drama called'The Lon
don Merchant.' The citizen and
his wife are seated at one side of
the stage, ready to express opinions.
From the announcement of the
title until the end the play is inter
rupted, changed, hindered by them.

"In the first place, they will not
have the title. 'Down with your
title, boy, down with your title!'
the citizen cries to the poor speaker
of the prologue, who iB doing his
best to follow out directions. After
choosing a new name for the play
they insist on having their appren
tice, Ralph, take part in the piece.
It is all written and cast, but the
worthy pair will have it made over
to their liking. So in order to
please them Ralph is taken into
the cast and permitted to play the
role of the Knight of the Burning
Pestle."

today. It is a satire upon the
common people's manners in the
theater. They are broadly guyed
for the way in which they interrupt
the performance, rooting for the
hero and down-with-ing the villain.
They are shown as following the
plot with such childlike faith that
every person becomes a real person
to be approved or scorned. You
can catch glimpses of the hooting
gallery god and the tearful matinee
girl and the objecting momtner of
our own playhouses.
"The play shows the stage pre
pared for a drama called'The Lon
don Merchant.' The citizen and
his wife are seated at one side of
the stage, ready to express opinions.
From the announcement of the
title until the end the play is inter
rupted, changed, hindered by them.

"In the first place, they will not
have the title. 'Down with your
title, boy, down with your title!'
the citizen cries to the poor speaker
of the prologue, who iB doing his
best to follow out directions. After
choosing a new name for the play
they insist on having their appren
tice, Ralph, take part in the piece.
It is all written and cast, but the
worthy pair will have it made over
to their liking. So in order to
please them Ralph is taken into
the cast and permitted to play the
role of the Knight of the Burning
Pestle."
The posters for the "Knight of
the Burning Pestle," announcing
the coming performance at the
"Stanford Plaie-Hous," made their
appearance today. The wording
was done by H. R. Johnson, '03,
and the artistic design is the work
of R. J. Sterrett, -'03. Last Sat
urday the cast of the play held a
dress rehearsal in Assembly Hall.
Today all the costumes, including
those for stage boys and for every
one who appears in the perform
ance, made according to minute
directions so as to conform to the
apparel of the Elizabethan period,
were handed over to the players.
The scenery is being prepared,
and will be ready for the first per
formance next Thursday night. In
this respect the undertaking is even
more extensive than the "Antigone"
of last year, since the cost of repro
ducing the effect of the seventeenth
century stage and playhouse, accu
rate in every detail, is exceedingly
heavy. Rehearsals will be held
every night until the performance
is given to the public.
This play is as laughable to
modern spectators as it could have
been to contemporary audiences.
Furthermore, although it does not
represent such a remote period of
antiquity as did the "Antigone," it
is almost equally valuable to the
student of the drama seeking a
conception of the stage and the
performance as they actually were
at the time when Shakspere wrote.
Nearly three hundred tickets
have already been ordered by mail
for the Saturday morning perform
ance. These have come largely
from the University of California
and from the secondary schools in
this vicinity. In the Sunday Chron
icle of February 22d appeared a
long article on the play as it is to
be given here, extensively illus
trated with photos taken of the
cast two weeks ago. Yesterday the
San Francisco Call gave an entire
page of its supplement to photo
graphs of the play and a cleverly
written article by Miss Sarah Corn
stock. The following aro quota
tions from the article:
"The play that the English Club
gives is called 'The Knight of the

Burning Pestle," and is no lees an
attempt than an old Beaumont and
Fletcher comedy, a play that dates
back to the beginning of the six
teen hundreds, and that the stu
dents are to give literally as it was
given in those early days of Lon
don theatricals, and again in 1635
at the court of Queen Henrietta.
It is rare enough now to see even a
Shaksperean production that in
cludes the prologue and all the
other queernesses of Shakspere's
time. But a play written by
'Frances Beaumont and John
Fletcher, Gent.,' and 'printed for
Walter Bur re and to be sold at the
signeof the Crane in Paules Church
yard'—rendered with full pro
logue, with historically correct
costumes, with the music of that
period accurate to the last song of
Master Merrythought —this is the
most whimsical prank that college
students ever played, and at the
same time the most interesting
study in English literature that our
Coast has ever been fortunate
enough to see. Assembly Hall is
to be the scene of the event. The
preparations are lavish in the line
of scenery and costumes. Not one
detail has been omitted that can
make the rendering of the play of
historical value. And the bur
lesque of the plot has its value
today. It is a satire upon the
