# SANTA CLARA WON.
## Parker Pitched Good Ball, but Was Given Miserable Support by His Team. 
### 
The Varsity buffered the second
defeat of the season at the hands of
the Santa Clara College boys Sat
urday afternoon. The work of the
college lads was that of seasoned
veterans, when contrasted with the
ragged playing of the Stanford
team. Martin had a little the bet
ter of Parker in the box, although
Stanford's pitcher allowed but six
scattered hits and none of Santa
Clara's three tallies was earned.
The playing steadied down after
the first half of the game, but in
the early innings error after error
was piled up against the erratic
wearers of the Cardinal. Santa
Clara in the second inning brought
two runs across the plate. Merle
and Keleher scored as the result of
a number of errors, two wild throws
to first being entirely beyond Cow
den's reach. In the sixth Merle,
who should have been put out at
first with ease, brought in another
run for Santa Clara on Feeney's
hit over second, and after this no
runner crossed the home-plate.
The Varsity had but few chances
to score, and seemed totally unable
to improve those that came within
reach. Martin's delivery was irre
sistible, Cowden being the only
man to score a clean hit, and Stan
ford could not touch the ball when
a hit would have meant a run.
There is little consolation in the
smallnese of the score, as the field
ing was extremely bad. Crawford
at short was an exception; he had
seven chances, and handled every
thing that came his way in Varsity
style. The team does not seem to
have settled down to steady play
ing, but with a realization in the
minds of the players of what has to
be done before the Intercollegiate
series commences, the remaining
games with Santa Clara should re
sult more favorably.
The score follows:
