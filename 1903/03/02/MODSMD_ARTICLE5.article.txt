# DANCE FRIDAY NIGHT.
## University Band Making Arrangements for Excellent Program. 
### 
Those who attend the University
Band dance in Palo Alto next Fri
day evening will not only have the
opportunity of dancing to band
music, but will enjoy a musical
treat in the selections themselves.
The numbers on the program will
be taken from all the late operatic
musical catches,"Florodora," "King
Dodo", and similar productions.
Anticipating a rush for tickets, the
band-boys have looked forward to
the comfort of their guests and
have placed the number of tickets
to be sold at one hundred. This is
a wise precaution and will contri
bute largely to the success of the
dance. Tickets are to be placed
on sale Tuesday morning and may
be obtained from K. Tuttle, '06, 1.
Anderson, '04, L. G. Moore, '03,
or G. H. Beebe, '04. The price
has been set at $1.50. The sale of
tickets will be confined entirely to
students and those connected di
rectly with the University.
The hall is to be decorated. This,
the first entertainment of the
kind given by the Band will be a
success in every particular. The
program will consist of sixteen
regular and four extra dances.
