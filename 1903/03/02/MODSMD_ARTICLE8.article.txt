# SERMONS IN CHURCH.
## Dr. Newton Preached in Morning and Chaplain Gardner Gave Address in Afternoon. 
### 
Dr. Newton yesterday preached
on the subject of "Cooperation,
working with God." His text was,
"We are laborers together with
God." I Corinthians, iii, 9.
"The cooperation of man with
God—this is the association which
crowns human life and assures its
real success. Plainly there is a
power working in the universe,—
working toward an aim. Contem
plate the majesty of the universe,
the sure sovereignty with which
law rules everything, and can you
question its purposefulness? It
was nothing more than a simple
scientific statement of the power at
work in nature when Matthew Ar
nold defined God, in the lowest
terms, as the Power, not of our
selves, making for righteousness.
"The power that is moving in you
in every impulse toward unselfish
ness—that Power is none other
than God. The co-partnership
with the power making for right
eousness, this it is which secures
success in life. When the heart of
Europe was stirred to the great
crusades, impossible seemed the
journey across the wide stretches of
land and the waste of the sea, over
whelming the force of the mighty
Saracen, but from their hearts went
up the cry, "God wills it." If your
life work of human helpfulness
forms part of that will of God,
your lifework can fail only when
God is beaten.
"For right is right, since God is God,
And right the day must win,
To doubt would be disloyalty,
To falter would be Bin."
Dr. Gardner in the afternoon
gave the address on "Honor thy
Father and thy Mother." He
spoke of the old reverence in former
times for parenthood, of the virtue
of Asiatic people in their respect
for and care of their parents, and
referred strongly to the too preval
ent modern American indifference
to their comfort and happiness.
"The old as they grow older lean
more and more upon their chil
dren for comfort, for sympathy, for
helpfulness and love, and too often
these things or their expression is
denied them out of carelessness, or
or cruelty, or indifference."
