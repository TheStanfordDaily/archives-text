Without si professional coach
and with scarcely a word of advice
from others than their own mem
bers, the English Club will this
week put on the Stanford stage
one of the most unique pro
ductions ever attempted by collegi
ans of the West or Middle West.
Following the "Antigone" of last
year, a high standard performance
had to be striven for and reached.
It is to be compared with the
"Antigone" in that both attempt
the exact reproduction of a stage of
an age other than our own. The
work of the cast has in no way
been slight or easy. To throw
themselves into the attitude of the
English player, of the English
tradesman and audience, to ade
quately represent the temperament
of bygone conditions, has taxed the
ingenuity of the committees and
directors and of the actors. That
it has been done successfully will
be the judgment of every student
of the Elizabethan period when
the play is seen Thursday night.
