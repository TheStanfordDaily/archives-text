# RICE WANTS REUNION.
## End of First Decade Appropriate Time for Return of Alumni to Campus. 
### 
The Stanford Alumnus made its
appearance today.
Instructor R. E. Swain,' 99, signs
an article on the new Chemistry
Laboratory; and the history of the
Inn Club, its formation and pres
ent status, are given space in an
article that will be gratifying to
those alumni who ate at the Inn
under the old regime. Articles on
the class of '94, the new Law Asso
ciation, and the athletic prospects
for the semester are included. The
usual attention is devoted to news
of alumni scattered over the coun
try whose work has attained places
that warrant chronicling.
A. B. Rice, '95, advocates a
reunion of alumni and old students
to be held in 1905, the end of first
alumni decade. He says:
In 1905 we ought to have a big
reunion at Stanford University.
In 1905 Stanford will have 2,000
graduates and about 3,500 former
students out in the world: an ag
gregate of some 5,500 men and
women outside the University rep
resenting all the classes since
Stanford first opened.
In 1905 Stanford's first four-year
product, the Pioneer Class, will
have been away from the univer
sity just ten years.
A reunion in 1905 will celebrate
the completion of the first alumni
decade. Jt will be the Stanford
graduates' first decennial.
In 1905, with more than two
years in which to develop the idea,
a large attendance can be secured.
Some sort of a Cardinal carnival
can be planned, with athletic
games on the campus, a play in the
great Assembly Hall, exhibitions
in the new Gymnasium, an eve
ning promenade concert in the old
quadrangle, aquatic sports on La
gunita, social affairs at the various
fraternity houses, and a general re
vival of old associations, with
plenty of life and Stanford spirit.
In 1905, preferably in the spring,
there can be perhaps three days de
voted to this great assembly.
