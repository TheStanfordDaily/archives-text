# HISTORY MEN GET TOGETHER.
## Stanford and California Professors Aim to Become Active in Association Work. 
### 
At a meeting held at the Uni
versity Club of San Francisco a
few days ago, at which Professors
Farrand of Stanford and H. Morse
Stephens of California were in
attendance, a definite decision was
reached to revive the California
Historical Society, which has been
inactive for the last ten years. The
objects and purposes of the society
will be as in the past, â€”the collec
tion and compilation of historical
matter. The project of bringing
the society to life was discussed,
and a committee was appointed to
further the plan. Those in attend
ance at the University Club meet
ing, besides Professors Farrand
and Stephens, were Judge Coffey
of San Francisco, Rev. W. A.
Brewer of St. Matthew's School,
Robert S. Thompson, Colonel A. S.
Hubbard, and Horace Davis.
The matter of organizing a Pacific
Coast Board of the American His
torical Association was also given
much attention.,, For some time
the history faculties of Stanford
and California have been meeting
together with this purpose in view.
At a recent meeting a definite de
cision Prof. Max
Farrand was appointed acting
president, and J. B. Landfield of
the University of California, acting
secretary. It was determined,
along witli tliis movement, to asso
ciate if possible the effort to revive
the California Historical Society.
