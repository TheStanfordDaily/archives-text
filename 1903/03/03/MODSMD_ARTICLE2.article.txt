# Lecture on Inns of Court.
## 
### 
Friday night Prof. Nathan Ab
bott gave the second lecture on the
study of law in the English inns.
The period his selected was from
the earlie&l t'imes to the reign of
Charles I, This period is divided
into two stages, commencing in the
sixteenth century, the latter being
the more systematized. The note
books kept by the early students
became the basis of the unofficial
reports. The latter commonplace
books became abridgments, but
legal text-hOoks increased slowly.
Jn 1550 a complete library
would consist of about twenty
volumes. Coke had about twice
that number.
The common law was early
famous for its involved and com
plex nature'. -It Was characterized
as an ungodly jumble. The study
was not academic, and although its
masters were ignorant and un
learned they were vigorous logi
cians. The were de
livered by a distinguished sergeant,
and were generally Hs good litera
ture as law. The botes were a
form of moot court where the pleas
and arguments were extemporane
ous. The a rgUmerits for the moots
were generally iwV4l* prepared. The
student was required to take part
in eighteen and sometimes twenty
seven moots before graduation.
The ten Inns of Chancery were
preparatory for the greater inns.
Here the students were taught, be
sides law, ' dancing, and
reverence. Their law study con
sisted of the study of inns. They
had one moot before entering the
greater inns. The reputation of
these inns was so that nobles
and knights wljo Iwtd intention
of imaking their sons barristers
kept tlieni at the Inns of Chancery
for u limited time.
