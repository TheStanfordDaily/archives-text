Tickets for the "Knight of the
Burning Pestle" were placed on
sale this morning at the Bookstore
on the campus, at the Stanford
Pharmacy in Palo Alto,and in San
Jo'se and San Francisco. A long
line had formed at the Bookstore
before the sale opened. The tickets
are being taken so rapidly that
there will doubtless he at both the
Thursday and Saturday perform
ances audiences ns large, if not
larger, than any that have attended
amateur dramatics at Stanford.
Rehearsals are being held each
night this week. Tomorrow eve
ning will occur the final dress re
hearsal, at which will be in at
tendance some of the dramatic
critics of the San Francisco papers.
The Southern Pacific has made a
round-trip rate from San Jose of
50 cents, good on the train leaving
that city at 9:20, and a rate of
$1:30 from San Krancisco, on the
train leaving Third and Townsend
streets at 9.
The following conversation with
the old English spelling touches
closely on the play:
"I' faitli friend Hvmphrey,! have
e'en ta'en thy advice. 1 betook
me, yester'eve, to yonder plaie
hovs to see "Ye Knight of ye
Bvrning Pestle" enacted by ye
children of ye Vniversitie. A
goodlie companie it is, forsooth, as
thov didst say; as good as ever
came vnto this town, aye, an' bet
ter than most that come from for
eign parts, I trow."
"Ay?and what tickled thy fancie
most, friend Lavncelot, the scene of
the Knight and the Giant?"
"Nay, an' I am of a more senti
mental tvrn than thov,sweet Hum
phrey. An' the fortvnes of fair
Mistress Lvce wovld e'en wring
tears from a stone, as I may say.
How plaintively she sang in the
wood, and how pitifvl her pleading
when her lover makes feint to stab
her, poor maid. Beshrew me! bvl
I wept for verie sympathy! For I
knew, no more than she, that he
was bvt trying her love, withal.
And at last when she sang that sad
wail over his coffin, I was half
minded to go vp and comfort her,

an' tell her there be ever as good
fish in the sea as ever came ovt, as
they say."
"Ay, friend, Mistress Lvce is all
verie well, as maids go, bvt liked
yov not the songs of that jollie old
gentleman Master Merrythovght?
How he skipped and frisked and
caroled like a schoolboy and was
e'en minded to sing at his own
son's fvneral!"
"Sing indeed! An' I had the
say, he shovld have been hanged
and qvartered! How sorely he
tried the good dame, his wife,
with his foolish songs and mangey
companions. A good sovl she
was, and mvch to be pitied."
''Well, an' here be my boat. I
bid ye farewell, Master Hvmphrey.
I see we shall ne'er be agreed on
the play an we talk a twelve
month."
"I bid ye farewell."
