# Palo Alto Gets Library.
## 
### 
Andrew Carnegie has added Palo
Alto to the long list of towns and
cities which have been enabled to
build libraries with funds donated
by him. J. F. Parkinson has been
notified that $10,000 will be placed
at the town's disposal as soon as
the legal formalities are concluded
and a site chosen. Mr. Parkinson
is a member of Palo Alto's board
of trade, and it is through his
efforts that the gift has been se
cured. While in the East recently
he made a personal application for
$20,000. The amount named was
considered too large for the size of
the town, and half the sum has
been granted.
Mr. Carnegie's stipulation is that
Palo Alto provide $1,000 a year for
maintenance, which is $200 less
than is being expended at present
on the town library. A site has
not yet been selected.
