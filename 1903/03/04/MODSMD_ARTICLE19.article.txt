# Sale of Tickets for Play.
## 
### 
Practically all the tickets for to
morrow night's presentation of the
Elizabethan play have been Bold.
Those reserved at Palo Alto and
San Jose are all gone. The aim of
the executive committee of the
English Club in giving a, Saturday
matinee was primarily for the ben

efit of the students and faculties of
the University of California, of
preparatory schools, and people
from other places. They allowed
orders for tickets from outsiders to
be placed with those in charge last
Monday and many of the desir
able seats for the Saturday per
formance are taken. Others are on
sale at the Bookstore on the
campus, and at the Stanford Phar
macy in Palo Alto.
