"The Knight of the Burning
Pestle" will be presented tomorrow
night and Saturday morning in
Assembly Hall by the English
Club. The executive committee of
the club conceived the idea of put
ting on an old English play the
first of last semester. The play
was selected in November and the
parts assigned about the first of
December, readings commencing
immediately thereafter. Since the
beginning of the semester regular
rehearsals have been held.
There are not only no profession
als in the cast, but has been no pro
fessional coaching or instruction;
vet Instructor Bassett of the Eng
lish department, who has charge of
the rehearsals, has held his actors
up to professional standards, at
least so far as regularity and seri
ousness of effort were concerned.
A large portion of the credit for
whatever success the play may

achieve, will be due to him; hut
the students in the cast will also he
entitled to their full share, for, un
like the performance of the Greek
play a year ago, their work is
purely voluntary, and receives
neither departmental supervision
nor University credit. In the first
dress rehearsal, with a part of the
scenery in place, one has been able
to form for the first time some idea
of how the stage will look. Al
though the conditions of Assembly
Hall limit the extent to which it is
possible to reproduce a complete
Elizabethan stage, yet when the
eye has passed behind the main
arch over the stage it practically
(inds itself in surroundings three
hundred yearsold. The committee
on scenery, under the direction of
H. R. Johnson, '03, has really ac
complished wonders in presenting
in small space some conception
of the theatrical conditions of
Shakspere's time.
The Elizabethan stage was prac
tically square, projecting into the
pit of the theater. The Stanford
stage will be narrowed by ignoring
a portion at each side, and the
audience must conceive its limits to
he marked by the portions actually
used by the players. At the cor
ners of the stage there will sit on
three-legged stools the young gen
tlemen of the Elizabethan audi
ence who choose that position in
order to show their fine clothes,
and who help to make life miser
able for the actors. Further back
there will be represented, in two
tiers, the stage ends of the circular
lines of gallery boxes which ran
around the interior of the Shak
sperean theater. In some of these
will sit members of the more aristo
cratic of the audience, and in one
of them also the little company of
musicians who are to play Eliza
bethan tunes between the acts.
Above the main scene at the rear
of the • stage is represented the
balcony or upper stage, and still
further up the little tower where
some of the scenery is kept and
where the trumpeter appears to
announce that the plav is about to
begin.
The rehearsals have also brought
out the downright fun of this old
play to an extent to which the
actors themselves have hardly ap
preciated it heretofore. The possi
bilities that this furnishes to a cast
of even mediocre ability may ap
pear from a brief outlineof the plot
of the play.
The main part of the plot is that
of the comedy represented to have
been originally intended for pro
duction by an Elizabethan com
pany, called "The London Mer
chant." This is the story of an
apprentice in love with his mas
ter's daughter, and his success in
outwitting her father, who has ac
cepted another suitor for her hand.
The girl consents to ride with the
more aristocratic suitor to Waltham
forest, where Jasper, the apprentice,
puts him to flight. There follows

the pastoral love scene, largely
serious in tone, of no little lyrical
beauty. But the angry father pur
sues in traditional fashion, and
Jasper is worsted after a brilliant
fight. His next movement is to
profess to have committed suicide,
and arrange to be carried in a
coffin to the house of his lady.
Ihe scene in which he discovers
himself to her as being really alive,
after she has sung a dirge over his
body, is romantic and sensational
enough for a popular audience of
any country. Meantime Jasper's
ghost has taken the precaution to
appear to the maiden's father and
to frighten him into a frame of
mind suited to the wishes of the
lovers.
This is the main plot in barest
outline; but it is only a small part
of the play. The father and
mother of the apprentice, Mister
and Mistress Merrythought, con
stantly appear in the guise of a
good-natured ne'er-do-well and a
disgusted wife; and the songs of
Merrythought—scraps of popular
Elizabethan ditties of every sort,
which he aptly applies to the situ
ations of the play—are one of the
chief features of the whole affair.
So much for the play as origi
nally constructed. But it is altered
and amended at the demand of the
grocer and his wife in the audience,
who insist that their apprentice
shall be taken into the cast and
made to do great deeds in honor of
the grocers. So Ralph the appren
tice becomes the Knight of the
Burning Pestle, and the title of the
play is changed to suit. This part
of the plot is an adaptation of the
Don Quixote story, which had been
published a few years earlier than
the date of this comedy. The
grocer-knight wanders near and
far, seeking injured persons to suc
cor "for his beloved Susan's sake,"
and his path happily crosses those
of the characters in the comedy of
the London merchant and his
daughter. The most amusing of
the adventures of the knight in that
concocted for him by the host of
the Ball Inn, who, seeing his desire
for benevolent action, persuades a
neighboring barber to piny the part
of the cruel giant, and the barber's
patient (who has been treated for
an affliction of the skin) to take
the part of a poor captive. The
knight thereupon has a brilliant
contest with the barber giant, and
believes that he has accomplished
a notable deed. Again and again,
at the demand of the grocer in the
