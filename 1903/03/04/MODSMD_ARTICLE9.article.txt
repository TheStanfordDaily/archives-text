The Junior Sweater Committee
took a stand yesterday which may
well he followed hy other classes.
We do not refer t^o'their action in
depriving a holdover from the pre
ceding class from wearing a 1904
sweater, for that might easily he
argued and settled in favor of the
neophyte; hut in granting emblems
only to those who are out for prac
tice in (heir sport from the begin
ning of the season the committee
did wisely. McCaughern has re
fused to allow any man to compete
in the interclass field-day who has
not the required preparation, hut
none of the other athletic captains
have for some years past held their
men to any such regulation. A
man who has the ability to make a
class team with a couple of days
preparation, more than likely has
it in him to benefit the Varsity
considerably, and it is not in any

way fair to the mediocre man who
works the Beason through on the
second teams to have preference
given to a man who is not willing
to work for his position. The reso
lutions adopted by the sweater
committee of the Junior class may
well be adopted by committees
from other classes.
