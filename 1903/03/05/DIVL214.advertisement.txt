WHAT CALIFORNIA BUSINESS COLLEGE IS DOING
California Business College is putting brains, experience and a high or
der of teaching ability and enthusiastic, conscientious service into the class
room, and it is maintaining a course of training that for thoroughness'
breadth and efficiency is equalled by few business colleges in the West.
It is equipping young men and young women with a tiaining that will
enable them to enter any office as stenographer or private secretary, or in the
counting-room as clerical assistant, and render immediate and acceptable ser
vice to their employers. It is today placing more students into lucrative and
responsible positions than at any period in the history of the institution. It
is positively refusing good paying positions for lack of young men and women
possessing the requisite qualifications to fill them. Tt is today commanding
wider influence and securing larger and more substantial patronage than at
any time since the organization of the College. Tt is today striving, as it has
been in the past, to provide a course of training that will command the confi
dence and respect of educated people. Our highest ambition is to have the
approval of the intelligent people solely upon our merits for thorough work.
