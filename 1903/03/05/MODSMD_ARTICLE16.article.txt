The suggestion for a Stanford
reunion to be held on the campus
in 1905, made in the last Alumnus
by Archie Rice, '95, will undoubt
edly meet the approval of the Stan
ford men and women who are scat
tered over the world. Let them come
together again, renew old acquaint
ances, and see the changes that the
years have made in the campus.
The effect of such a reunion would
mean much to the old graduate and
much to the students who will for
years to come wear the Stanford
pin and give the Stanford yell.
It will serve to unify the old spirit
and the new; it will keep the old
men in touch with the younger
generations. Rice says:"The first
thing is to spread the idea of a
Stanford reunion to he held on the
campus in 1905. Then the Alumni
Association can take hold of the
matter and rely on some energetic
and representative committeemen
to manage and develop the general
plans.
