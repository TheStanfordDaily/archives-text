# The 						Kilties' Concert.

### 
The concert given by The Kilties
in Assembly Hall yesterday after
noon was a very successful one. It
was attended by several hundred
people, many of whom came from
near-by towns. The music on the
whole was very good, although the
brasses sounded uncomfortably
loud, owing to the peculiar acous
tics of the hall. The program was
long and varied, and was rushed
somewhat owing to the number of
encores. Pipe Sergeant Ferguson's
bag-pipe solo, "The Pibroch of Don
nald Dhu," aroused much enthusi
asm. The wierd, shrill music of the
Scot's national instrument is always
a novelty to an American audience.
There were a number of Scotch
dances and songs. The large Kil
ties' choir rendered a pretty old
Scotch song, "Scots Who Mae,"
very effectively. The program
closed with a march by Geitz, "The
Chicago Marines."
