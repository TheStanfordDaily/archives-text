Next Wednesday Dr. J. C. Plan
ner will sail from San Francisco
on the steamer Siberia for the
Hawaiian Islands. He is to be
away from the University about a
month. The trip is to be taken
primarily for Dr. Planner's health
and at his physician's advice. Dr.
Branner has not been feeling well
for the past two months. While
on the Islands he will take the op
portunity of visiting the volcanoes,
but beyond this no geological work
will be done. In Dr. Bra liner's
absence his courses, which have
been under the direction of Pro
fessor Newsom and Assistant Lyon
during his late sickness, will con
tinue as at present. The lectures
in Physiography are to be tempor
arily suspended, and will be re
sumed after Dr. Branner's return.
