# PALO ALTO BOYS' CLUB.
## Y.M.C.A. Has Opportunity for Doing Good Work Among Youth of Town. 
### 
With the view of putting boys
in the way of becoming efficient
men, the Y. M. C. A. has organized
in Palo Alto a Boys' Club, the ac
tivities of which will consist of
manual training, military drill,
music, gymnastics, and athletics.
The club will follow as near as
practicable the lines pioneered by
Mr. Sidney Peixotto, well known
in socialogical circles for his suc
cess in developing 'the Columbia
Park Boys Club in San Francisco.
Mr. Peixotto's course of procedure
was to start on a very small scale;
to limit the number of boys to fif
teen or twenty until, they became
a well trained, efficient corps of
workers; then to divide the workers,
making each half the nucleus of a
club of about twenty members.
This was continued until the avail
able boys were organized in a num
ber of clubs, each of which main
tained its individuality, electing
its own president, secretary, and
baseball captain.
The work of the Association has
been going on under the direction
of Hugh A. Moran, '04, head of the
Social Service department since the
beginning of the semester. There
are at present two clubs of twenty
boys each, which meet Saturday
afternoons for military drill, after
which they go to Nortree Hall,
where they have impromptu theat
ricals, singing, and debating. Plans
for classes in wood-working are
under way.
The situation at Stanford pre
sents peculiarly favorable oppor
tunities for bringing a project of
this kind to a successful culmina
tion, the work being easily acces
sible to large numbers of students
qualified to instruct boys in wood
work, athletics, gymnasium work,
and debating. The boys in Menlo,
Mayfield, and adjoining towns can
in time be organized into clubs in
which the element of intertown
rivalry will afford a powerful
stimulus.
