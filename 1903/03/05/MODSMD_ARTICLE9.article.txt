# BOATING IN 1893.
## Enthusiasm Ban High.—Senator and Mrs. Stanford Offered Money to Start Sport. 
### 
In 1893 the boating question
was first agitated at Stanford, tliere
being a possibility that a team
might he sent to the World's Fair
to represent Stanford in the inter
national regatta. At that time en
thusiasm on the subject ran high.
A boat club with a large member
ship was formed and the boathouse
which stands on the edge of Lagu
nita was built, there being an idea
prevalent that the liitle lake was
large enough for crew practice work.
At that time also, rowing as an
intercollegiate event was spoken of.
But the boom died out within a
few months, and nothing more was
said at Stanford about annual
meets with the State University or
any other institution until re
cently.
January 27, 1893, the Daily
Palo Alto got out an extra, the
occasion being what was thought
to be the assurance of a trip to
Chicago. It said: "The doubt as
to whether Stanford would be able
to have its crew at Chicago among
those of Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
Oxford, Cambridge, Cornell, and
other great universith s of the world,
has faded away. It is now decided
that Lake Michigan will have the
opportunity of tossing the Cardinal
in its play. This is made possible
by the generosity of those whose
names have become almost a
synonym of generosity —Leland
Stanford and his wife."
Senator Stanford offered $SLO
for the starting of the sport and
Mrs. Stanford added $300, the sum
being sufficient to buy the shells
which had been settled upon. The
club broke up before either was
called upon for the money.
