# SUCCESSFUL PRESENTATION OF PLAY.
## First Performance Goes Through Without a Hitch. Second Performance Tomorrow Morning at 10:30. 
### 
As near an was possible, the old
play, "The Knight of the Burning
Pestle," was put on the Stanford
stage last night as it was put on
in the days of Queen Elizabeth.
The house was crowded, and from
start to finish applauded the actors.
The play went off without a hitch.
The setting had been admirably
done.
The whole play was' just as it
was enacted in the old "Swan"
theater. The costumes, music,
scene-shifters, stage furnishings,
action, and dialogue were exact re
productions of Elizabethan play
acting, with one important excep
tion —the parts of two women in
the play, Luce, the daughter of
Venturewell and heroine, and Mrs.
Merrythought, the wife of the
ne'er-do-well of the piece, were
taken by women. Jn Shakspere's
time all woman-parts were taken
by boys. The part of the Grocer's
Wife, now as then, was acted out
by a man, it being a little too
robust for feminine handling in
these more refined days.
In Elizabethan plays a large
number of equally important char
acters were looked to for the presen
tation.
The title role was peculiarly
difficult —"The Knight"— because
almost mock heroic, an English
Don Quixote. Mr. Seward re
deemed the part from buffoonery
by sincerity and directness of act
ing, and carried off well the bur
lesque of the romantic comedy.
There was through the play a seri
ousness amid the fun, a character
istic of Elizabethan plays in
general.
The pastoral scene where Miss
Mary Oilman in the role of the
heroine, Luce, meets her fugitive
lover, Jasper, the run-a-way ap
prentice, and later in the scene
where his dead body, coffined is
borne in before her, after his sup
posed death in the combat in the
forest, in the simplicity of Eliza
hethan days are full of genuine
feeling, only to be met with nowa
days in tragedy. The strain of
feeling was shortly relieved in
merry old English style by the dis
covery that Jasper's death is all a
mistake.
E. O. James as Merrythought,
the absolutely heedless ne'er-do
well husband, did not interpret bis
part as that of a careless, drunken
buffoon, but rather as that of a
merry philosopher, or comic Soc
rates with somewhat Xantippish
wife. His creed is that "it's naught
but mirth that keeps the body
from the earth."
Miss Frances Kerr,'o3, as the wife
of Merrythought, had a somewhat
ungracious part to play, a virago
to her light-hearted consort, whose
whims and songs are supposed 10
catch the audience; but she won its
sympathy in spite of the situation
as a scolding wife by her loyalty to
her favorite son, Michael, in their
accumulated misfortunes, and a

certain sweetness in her wrath at
her truculent husband.
W. J. Stack, '03, as Venturewell,
the obdurate merchant and iron
father of the heroine, Luce, had
perhaps the most conventional part
to play in the whole drama, but in
his line reconciliation to the union
of his daughter to Jasper by the
good offices of Merrythought he
did an effective bit of individual
acting.
Humphrey was the scapegrace of
the play, the discarded lover, the
beaten man in every encounter, the
butt of fortune at every turn, and
E. K. May, '00, won the good feel
ing of the spectators by the way he
made this hero cheerfully face the
buffeting of fate. There was very
little glory to be won in the part,
but May extracted all there was by
falling down gamely whenever the
play demanded his career be sacri
ficed.
C. W. Thomas, Jr., '03, as Jasper,
the lover of the piece, the sport of
fortune in the play, had the diffi
cult part of carrying himself un
moved among the comic surround
ings of many of the scenes when
his own action had to be serious
and impassionate. His numerous
fights were an easier task, and the
action in these spirited scenes was
very good. In the coffin scene
where he is borne in before his
lady-love, who sings a dirge over
his body and then finds he is alive,
t he mechanical difficultiesof getting
out of the coffin without breaking
the dignity of their reunion or let
ting the happy scene which followed
degenerate into farce, were over
come excellently.
Probably the most laughable
scene in the play was the battle
between the barber —C. D. Mc-
Comisli, '03, taking that part —and
Ralph. Georgeand Tim —E.V.lien-
ley,'o6, and H. A. Halsey,'o6 —were
well played. P. 0. Edwards, '06,
and O.H. Clarke, '06, as tapster and
innkeeper, carried off their parts in
good shape. R. J. Sterrett, '03,
as prologue boy, brought on the
unique signs announcing the
change of scene, and conducted the
play as became an old-time stage
director.
In fact every part was well inter
preted and well played. Fiddlers,
pages, gallants, and box-holders
carried out the modern conception
of the Elizabethan age.
E. O. James' singing of the
old Elizabethan aiis and ditties de
serves especial mention. These
songs were not all original with
Beaumont in the writing of the
"Knight," hut were the popular
songs of the time. They are
brought into the play by Merry
thought at all sorts of opportune
moments, and James' singing to
the old sixteenth century airs was
a decided hit. Particularly good
was his "Begone, Begone, My
Pnggy, My Wuggy. Begone, Be
gone, My Dear," a balcony song
