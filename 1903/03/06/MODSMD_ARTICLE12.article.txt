At their meeting this afternoon
the Athletic Committee decided to
allow two teams of the California
Association Football League to play
a game on the campus. This con
test will occur sometime within the
next six weeks. The game will be
in the nature of an exhibition to
impress its good points upon col
lege men with the ultimate object
of making it a branch of University
athletics.
A game was played last Saturday
on the Berkeley campus between
two teams of the League. A large
crowd from the university watched
the game. The comments of the
California varsity football men, al
though biased, are interesting.
They are practically unanimous
in agreeing that it gives more men
a chance, since speed and agility
count for more than brawn. It
seemed to be the prevailing opinion
that the game is just as dangerous
if not more so, than intercollegiate
football as it is now played. Pres
ident Wheeler of California is in
favor of the game, but the proba
bility of it being played by the Uni
versity of California is very re
mote.
