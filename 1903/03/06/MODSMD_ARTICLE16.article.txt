# VARSITY WINS.
## Stanford Takes Third Game of Series by Score of 8 to 7.—Wet Grounds and Ragged Playing. 
### 
With a lean) weakened by the
absence (if Covvden and Lowenthal,
Stanford won from Santa Clara
yesterday afternoon for the first

time this seuson. The grounds
were wet ami slippery, contribut
ing largely toward loose playing
and wild throwing, in which both
teams shared about equally. Stan
ford started off with a dash, secur
ing five runs in the second, by a
combination of heavy hitting and
Santa Clara's errors. By the
seventh the Varsity was but one
run in the lead but kept its advant
age through a clever tliree-base hit
by Crawford to right-field and a
bunt by Hall which brought
Crawford in from third. Santa
Clara secured her last run during
this inning, making the final score
8 to 7 in favor of the Varsity.
Roosevelt went into the box for
Stanford, and during six innings
allowed the college boys but one
clean hit. He was very wild, how
ever, passing five men to first. In
the sixth inning, with three men
on bases, Parker went into the box.
Martin, who did the pitching for
Santa Clara, proved comparatively
easy, being found for ten safe hits,
of which Williams, a freshman in
center-field, secured three during
his four times at bat. The game
was loosely played, but gratifying
in that the Varsity held together
at critical junctures.
Umpires, Edwards and Toomey.
Scorer, Stud ley.
