# New Stage Curtain.
## 
### 
A very handsome new stage cur
tain was used for the lirst time at
the performance of the English
play in Assembly Hall last night.
The curtain is the gift of Mrs.
Stanford, and, as was intended hy
the donor, came as a surprise to all.
The material of which it is made is
cardinal plush. Two- pictures are
printed upon itâ€”on the left side a
California miner of the pioneer era,
and on the right the California
seal. The stage artist of the Tivoli
theater in San Francisco had charge
of the construction of the curtain.
