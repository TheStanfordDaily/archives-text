# Question Comes Tomorrow.
## 
### 
At five o'clock tomorrow night
the question for debate in the an
nual intercollegiate contest with
the University of California will be
wired to Stanford by the debaters
from across the bay. Owing to the
fact that the Library will be closed
Monday, on account of Founder's
Day, the men will not be able to
begin effective work until Tuesday.
This will allow but twelve days of
preparation for the final try-out
which takes place in the chapel
Saturday evening, March 21st.
