Senator Leland Stanford was
born at Watervliet, New York,
eight miles from Albany, March ( J,
1824, and died in the Stanford res
idence June 20, 1893. His father
was a farmer, and Leland worked
on the farm, attending the common
schools until he was twelve years
of age, and for three years he re
ceived instruction at home, and
later went to an academy at Clin
ton, New York. Upon his deter
mination to study law he entered
a law oflice in Albany, and after
three years of study was admitted
to the bar. Mr. Stanford saw the
opportunity in the West, and lo
cated in 1848 in a small town in
Wisconsin, called Port Washing
ton, where he entered upon the
practice of law. As a lawyer his
earnings for the first year were
$1260. In 1850 he was married at
Albany to Miss Jane Lathrop, the
daughter of a merchant of that
city. The total destruction by fire
of Mr. Stanford's law office in 1852,
coming as it did at the time tidings
of the discovery of gold in Califor
nia were reaching the East, turned
him to the scenes of his later
wealth. He arrived at San Fran
cisco July 12, 1852, and soon after
opened a general store at Cold
Springs, Eldorado county. In 1855
he commenced business in Sacra
mento.
Mr. Stanford's political life be
gan in 1880 when he was delegate
at-large to the Republican conven
tion at Chicago, which chose
Lincoln as its standard bearer.
In 1861 he was chosen governor of
California. The part he played in
the building of the Central Pacific
is too well known to need atten
tion here. His connection with
this railroad brought him the
colossal fortune that was after
ward to build the Leland Stanford
Junior University. Mr. Stanford
was elected to the United States
Senate in 1885, and at the expira
tion of his first term was chosen for
another six years, but died just be
fore the beginning of this second
term. In 1885 he and Mrs. Stan
ford united in founding the Leland
Stanford Junior University, built
in memory of their only son, Le
land Jr., who died in Florence,
Italy, May 14, 1884.
