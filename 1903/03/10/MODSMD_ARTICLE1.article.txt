# TALK IN ASSEMBLY.
## Dr. Parkin Speaks but Briefly on the Rhodes Scholarships. 
### 
At the University Assembly this
morning the address hy l)r. George
R. Parkin of Oxford University,
which had been announced on the
bulletin-boards, was given. His
talk was prefaced by a brief ad
dress from President Adams of the
University of Arizona.
Dr. Parkin, representing the
trustees for the Rhodes scholar
ships in Oxford, said but little con
cerning the subject on which it was
announced he would speak. He
discussed the relations which
should exist between the two great
Anglo-Saxon nations and the policy
of Cecil Rhodes in founding his
plan for the cultivation of a better
understanding between them. He
referred to the difficulties which
the little country of England has
met and successfully conquered in
ruling nearly four hundred million
of human beings, and the great
changes which have come over the
sentiments and outlook of Ameri
can statesmen since recent history
has forced similar problems upon
them, c
As the- Mediterranean in ancient
times and the Atlantic during the
past foqr centuries have been the
theater of international rivalry,
the Pacific in the twentieth century
is likely to be the scene of action.
Britain and theUnited States—from
our Pacific coast, from Canada,
Australia, and the English posses
sions in China —with Japan,control
this sea, and the future welfare of
the world is bound up with their
friendly cooperation.
The purpose of the Rhodes
scholarships is by bringing good
young men from every English
speaking community of the world
under the influence of Oxford, to
cement this union.
