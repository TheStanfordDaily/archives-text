The English Clul> and the cast
of "The Knight of the Burning
Bestle'' are to be congratulated up
on having successfully presented an
old English play to a modern au
dience. So far not a word of criti
cism has been heard. Both per
formances were in every way credi
table to the University. A great
deal of hard work and study were
necessary in order to reproduce ef
fectively the Elizabethan costum
ing, stiiging, and acting. Those
who have known the inside work
ings of the rehearsals and the pre
liminary drills were pleased with
the recognition given Instructor
Bassett during the Saturday per
formance. His work has been
hard and much of it unpleasant.
There are others who did not ap
pear on the stage itself deserving
commendation whose chief reward
must be in the satisfaction that
they have assisted a Stanford or
ganization in putting before a Stan
ford audience a play such as few
people in America have looked at.
