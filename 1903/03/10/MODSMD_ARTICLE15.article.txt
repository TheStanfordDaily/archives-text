# SECOND RENDITION OF PLAY.
## Assembly Hall Well Filled Saturday Morning. — Many Visitors on Hand. 
### 
The second production of "The
Knight of the Burning Pestle" Sat
urday morning in Assembly Hall
was greeted by a larger audience
than assembled even for the first
performance. About eighteen hun
dred people filled the lower floor
anil all of the gallery but the con
cave sides, a large part of the audi
ence having come from San Jose,
San Francisco, Oakland, and
Berkeley.
The performance itself was a rep
etition of the success of Thursday
night, minor improvements being
made in some of the scenes. C. W.
Thomas, '03, as Jasper, when ap
pearing after his supposed death to
his irate father-in-law, Venture
well, this time came clothed in long
white garments, adding consider
ably to his effectiveness as a ghost
—a difficult part for Jasper; and
his jovial old father, Merrythought,
scored a hit as before when he
received the returning shade of his
son with a full tide of his unquench
able light-heartedness. Another
unexpected hit "in the play was
Merrythought's reception of his
wandering wife and younger son,
home from the robbers and the
wood, and his making Michael
sing, and Venturewell also, on their
lugubrious entramce.
The hardships of Humphrey
again in his unlucky wooing, and
the woe of his martial encounters,
seemed pleasant to the hard-hearted
spectators, as was the acting of In
structor Seward in his meteoric
career as "the Knight."
But the particular star of the
play was the Grocer's Wife. J. K.
Bunnell, '02, in this omnipresent
part had a chance to get into every
actio!) of the play. Whether the
fun was fast and furious, as in the
tights and most of the passages, or
whether there was the periodic lull
between the acts, when the gallants
and Elizabethan dames of the
boxes and stage were showing off
their courtly behavior, there was
always something interesting going
on in the corner where the Grocer
and his flamboyant spouse sat.
The Grocer's Wife's opinion of to
bacco. her care and comfort for the
fallen in the encounters from the
overflowing plenty of her reticule,
her management of the stage an
nouncer, of the Grocer, the gallants,
Mrs. Merrythought's appearances,
the career of Ralph, and of the play
in general, from her climb upon
the stage until her "Come, George '
at the close met the uproarious ap
proval of the audience.
Miss Luce and Mrs. Merry
thought, the former in her lament
and song for Jasper, and the latter
in stormy interviews with an im
provident husband, did serious act
ing. In the Elizabethan comedy

scenes of beauty and feeling were
intermingled with passages of pure
buffoonery. Miss Kerr's impas
sioned appeals to her husband were
not intended by the scope of the
play to be taken seriously, but they
were good enough to have been gen
uine instead of being wasted on a
farcical situation. Miss Oilman's
song over the body of her slain
lover, rendered in the pathetic
minor Elizabethan air, was touch
ing, making it almost a matter of
regret that her lover alive in the
box all the time, as is known to the
audience, detracts from its serious
ness.
The buck and wing and toe
dancing of Mr. Stack of San Fran
cisco between the acts was much
appreciated. It was an exhibi
tion of a very difficult art, and he
was subject to numerous recalls.
