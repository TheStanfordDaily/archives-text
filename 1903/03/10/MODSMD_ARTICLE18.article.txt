# Band Gives Dance.
## 
### 
- The dance given by the Univer
sity Band Friday night in Palo
Alto to help pay for the new instru
ments recently purchased, was not
very largely attended. About for
ty couples danced to the music of the
Ba nd, which played unusually well
and kept excellent time. The
hall was decorated with car
dinal. A well selected pro
gram of sixteen dances and four ex
tras was given. The receipts of this
venture of the Band were barely
large enough to pay expenses. The
Band will proably give another
dance the latter part of April.
The patronesses were as follows:
Mesdames M. R. Smith, P. J.Frein,
M. G. Dodge, S. K. Mathews, J. P.
Smith, and Miss Lillian E. Ray.
