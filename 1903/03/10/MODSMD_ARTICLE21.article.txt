# STANFORD DEFEATS MILLS.

### 
On the lloble courts Saturday
morning the tennis team from Mills
College met defeat at the hands of
the Stanford women players by a
score of 49 to 26. The tournament
was not played in sets, and singles
alone were contested. One hour
was allowed for each match, and
the players with the larger number
of games at the end of the matches
won. The Mills girls showed a
lack of practice, and also suffered
from the fact that they played on
a strange court. Miss Mabel Ray,
'05, and Miss Mary Hodge, '03,
played brilliant games. The whole
Stanford team played good games
as a result of consistent practice.
The result by matches was as fol
lows: Miss Finley, Mills, 4, vs.
Miss Mary Hodge, '03, 15; Miss
Lindstrom, MillH, 8, vs. Miss May me
Hendricks, '03, 14; Miss Gertrude
Holmes, Mills, vs. Miss Mabel Ray,
'05, 13; Miss Hodge, Mills, 11, vs.
Miss Elizabeth Lodge, '03,7. Total:
Mills College, 26; Stanford, 49.
The linemen were Misses Rue,
Mary Craig, and Alice Klugel for
Mills College; for Stanford, Misses
Elizabeth Peckham, '03, Dorothy
Abbott, '06, and Ella lbs, '03.
