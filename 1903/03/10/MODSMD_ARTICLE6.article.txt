# "A TYPE OF AMERICAN MANHOOD."
## Sermon in Memory of Senator Stanford Preached in Memorial Church Sunday Morning by Dr. Newton. 
### 
Yesterday was the anniversary
of the birth of Senator Leland
Stanford. Services in his memory
were held in Memorial Church Sun
day morning. The sermon, which
was preached by Dr.Heber Newton,
was on "A Type of American Man
hood."
Dr. Newton opened by presenting
the thought that reverence for the
dead has been throughout history
the quickener of other and larger
reverences. "Especially has it,
perhaps, begotten the faith of im
mortality. Well is it for the uni
versities of our land, the centers of
its intellectual life, that, as in our
sister university, the desk of the
illustrious Le Conte is each year,
upon his birthday, strewn with
flowers; and as here in our own
Stanford we gather together to
cherish the memory of him who
founded this seat of learning.
"The Christian pulpit should
never so far forget itself as to be
come the tribune whence indiscrim
inating praise shall blur all moral
distinctions, and eulogy shall be
come so fulsome as to make its
own sincerity suspect. The sim
plicity and sincerity of the man
whom we honor today would have
been offended by any laudation of
himself that was not modest and
temperate."
Dr. Newton disclaimed any at
tempt at adequate analysis of the
character of the founder of the
University. All that he undertook
was to picture for the newer mem
bers of the student body the main
outlines of his character.
"Character is at its core, strength
fulness, moral vigor, spiritual en
ergy. Tennyson opens his 'In
Memoriam' with the invocation
'Strong Son of God.' The essential
characteristic of the Divine Man,
because of which he was the Divine
Man, wfts strengthfulness of soul.
No man achieves a great character
save as it is the expression of
moral and spiritual forcefulness.
Most vices are the signs of weak
ness. Virtue is virtus —virility.
The founder of this University is a
type of our American manhood in
his strengthfulness of character.
The various aspects of his charac
ter reveal this essential strength
fulness of spirit. He was a man of
magnificent courage. The build
ing of the trans-continental railroad
and the holding of California to
the Union were considered as illus
trations of this characteristic. His
ftircefulness was shown in his
mighty will —finely exhibited in
both of these undertakings of his
career. His was a nature strong
in its integrity. Despite the politi
cal rancor which followed him,
such as followed other men of
equally unsullied character, sham
ing itself more than once by haunt
ing him even in the grave with
calumny which 110 longer can he
silenced by its victim, this was the
impression made on his contem
poraries—an impression made

most strongly upon those who
knew him best. His justice was,
as all true justice should be, carried
beyond the letter of the law into a
spirit of sympathy and kindliness.
With justice there rarely goes the
overplus which thus manifests
itself. Instances of his helpfulness
to his fellow men are known to
most of those who remember him.
He carried this kindliness so far as
to be considerate and thoughtful
for animals to a remarkable de
gree.
"The founder of this University
was strong where hosts of rich men
are weak —in the power of consci
ence to master selfishness and hold
wealth as a veritable trust. If this
country can develop the force of
conscience which will master the
temptation of our enormous money
power and write in the hearts of
our modern aristocracy of wealth
the motto of >the ancient French
nobility, 'Noblesse oblige,'all will
go well with us. We need then
fear no wild schemes of social revolt,
no anarchistic dreams such as
scare so many timid conservative
souls.
"The founder of this University
presents a fine illustration of Am
erican manhood in his strong pa
triotism. During the latter portion
of his years he was chiefly engaged
in the service of the State. No
more encouraging sign of times can
be scanned upon the horizon than
the increasing attraction of our
young man of brains to the public
service, to civic duties and to na
tional affairs. We need more of
the spirit that was manifested in a
notable funeral in New York not
long ago, when an aged Catholic
priest, who had been always un
questionably loyal to the church of
his birth and of his love, as he lay
in his coffin, was at his own request
vested in his priestly robes, with
the American flag thrown over the
casket.
"Every form of philanthropy is
leading us back to the need of a
higher social organization and to a
nobler administration of govern
ment.
" The founder of this University
presents us with a fine type of Am
erican manhood in his personal re
ligion. His provision for the cul
ture of religion in Our University is
known to all. For the principles
of religion he had a profound ven
eration. When his great sorrow
came to him, there was a revelation
of the unseen world to his soul, and
the belief in immortality became
thenceforward the dominant con
viction of his life. The crown of a
noble manhood and womanhood
has in all the days gone by been
found in reverence towards the in
finite and eternal mysteries amid
which we stand, in a simple trust
in the Power above and within us,
in an earnest endeavor to form the
life to the beautiful order of the
starry worlds and of the moral law
revealed within us."
