# QUESTION FOR DEBATE.
## In Annual Contest with California Subject Hinging on Monroe Doctrine Will be Discussed. 
### 
"Resolved, That the United States
should not attempt under all cir
cumstances to prevent the acquisi
tion of territory in South America
by European powers," was the
question received by wire from
Berkeley Saturday evening. Stan
ford debaters on the whole view
the subject as a good debatable
question and one that will make
an interesting debate for both sides.
The question hinges on the modern
interpretation of the Monroe Doc
trine. The affirmative in the de
bate, looking at the question from
the standpoint of a broad issue, will
oppose a strict observance of the
doctrine; while the negative will be
compelled to uphold in the strictest
sense President Roosevelt's inter
pretation of the time-honored policy
of the United States. Some dissat
isfaction has been expressed in re
gard to the wording of the subject.
There seems to be a slight chance
for a quibble, but the main issue
stands out clearly enough to pre
vent any attempt at avoiding the
broad principle under discussion.
Stanford has one week to make a
choice of side. This matter will be
left largely in the hands of the
Carnot team and faculty committee
on debating. The final try-outs
will take place in the chapel one
week from next Saturday night.
Thirteen contestants divided into
two squads will speak. The de
baters have not yet arranged their
order of speaking, and but one
squad has made a choice of sides.
In this, three speakers took the
affirmative and four the negative
side of the question.
