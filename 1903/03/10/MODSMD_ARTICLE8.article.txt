# Stanford Defeats Independents.
## 
### 
The Varsity won from the Inde
pendents last Saturday by the score
of 6 to 2 in a game that was well
played in general but suffered from
ragged work in spots. Parker was
steady and effective, allowing but
five hits and passing but three
men to first. Stanford secured five
hits off of Ferine, who pitched six
innings, and hit Schmidt five
times in the last three. Although
Stanford made three errors, they
were not costly; while the poor form
of the visitors was responsible for
the reversal in result of the contest
of two weeks ago.
