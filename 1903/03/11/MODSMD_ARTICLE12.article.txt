# TRACK PROSPECTS.
## Hard Work, Careful Training, and Many Candidates Make Strong Team for Stanford. 
### 
The track candidates have been
improving steadily in their trials.
They are anxious to run, and the
trainer is kept busy preventing
them from over-work. Already
the majority of the men are making
time that equals any made last
year. In the mile, 5:05 was the
best time made before the big meet
last year. This season Sprague,
Gay, and Holman have all done
under five minutes. Dunn, Smith,
and Grossman will all do under 52
seconds in the quarter before the
meet. There are more than half a
dozen men in the half-mile who are
doing under 2:12.
The lower end of the track, which
is soft and treacherous, will be
rolled and hardened. As soon as
this is dune faster trials will be
run.
When the Stanford track team
enters the Intercollegiate meet on
the eighteenth of April there will
be a good man in every event.
California has a lot of steady per
formers. The meet should be full
of hard races and finishes, and the
final score in all probability will
be very close.
Turpin and Ilawley in the hun
dred, McCaughern and Ilawley in
the two-twenty, Thomson and Hol
man and a number of new men in
the half, Sprague, Holman, Gay
and Lovell in the mile, Sprague,
Lovell, and Gundrum in the two
mile, Kuhn, Naramore, and Weller
in the hurdles, Beach, Dole, Whit
aker, Bell, Lyons, Naramore, and
Weller in the jumps, and Hyde,
Crawford, and lflstesin the weights,
make a good team in themselves.
Besides these men there are many
new candidates who will show up
in the big meet.
