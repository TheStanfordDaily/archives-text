The question for debate with the
University of Washington received
here today is interesting and debat
able. It is one that has never be
fore been discussed here, and one
that will give the men who work it
up much valuable information on
English and American constitu
tion, something that every Univer
sity man should have. The ques
tion to be debated with California,
while it will probably not reveal so
much valuable information, is
more of a live issue, and will there
fore be the most interesting de
bate. The NVashingtonians are to
be commended upon the clearness
and fairness with which their ques
tion is worded.
