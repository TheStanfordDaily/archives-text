There is a marked contrast be
tween the work on the track this
year and work done two or three
years ago. The time was when the
men went on the track when con
venient and, perhaps under the
eye of the trainer or perhaps not,
worked awhile and went in. No
one but members of the track squad
took any particular interest in the
team. No one came out for fall
training, and scarcely a man began
work before the first of March.
New and mediocre men were justi
fied in keeping off the path, for
they were considered more or less
of a nuisance. When the meets
went to the State University, we
were sorry that it should be so but
took it as a matter of course. Since
that time there has come a change
in the attitude of the student body
toward the track. A large num
ber of candidates fill the cinder
path at all hours of the day, and
mostly through them has been

worked up whatever sentiment
there is in the student body in
favor of honest training. Whether
we win or not we will have the
satisfaction of knowing that there
has gone against California a team
that lias taken a stand for unity,
an exemplification of the Stanford
spirit.
