Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In shaping the course pursued
this semester by the Y. M. C. A.
the Association has profited largely
by systematically gathering the
current "knocks" of the faculty
and student body. This system,
however, is not altogether satisfac
tory as a means of obtaining in
formation, chiefly, perhaps, because
of the difficulty of obtaining an ad
equate amount of data through the
scattering reports that come to
hand; also because of a certain
amount of wear and tear on one's
disposition incident to being told
of remarks originally addressed to
disinterested hearers. It would be
desirable if an arrangement could
be made similar to the one with a
friend of mine, who, in carrying
out the principle that a certain
amount of opposition is necessary
to the healthy growth of an organi
zation, was conscientiously de
nouncing the Association in a per
sistent and rather public manner.
So many "knocks" were wafted to
my ears from this source that J
went to my friend and asked him
to give us a short rest. The grounds
on which the request was made
were that the Association as a
Stanford organization strives with
other Stanford organizations to
strengthen Stanford; that among
other things, we do what we can to
cheer up the freshmen in the fall,
to furnish them the means of ob
taining sorely needed information,
and to present them in a social
way to the older members of the
student body; that we help the
working-student to get his first job,
and the faculty women to get stu
dent help; that we do this for
nothing and board ourselves. 1
stated further that our devotional
meetings were not at present so
largely attended that other student
body activities were menaced, and
that we could see no reason why
there should not be a cessation of
the anvil chorus. After carefully
weighing these considerations my
friend decided to suspend public
denunciation of Association meth
ods; at my earliest opportunity I
reclined in bis window-seat and in
the privacy of his room listened
attentively for two hours and a
half while be told me of Y. M. C. A.
wrorg-doings, past and present.
The advantages of thus hearing the
news are obvious.
It is not the object of this com
munication to lessen the criticisms
of the Association, for it is through
criticism that we learn our mis
takes; we would simply suggest
that the sledge-hammers lie forged
into pens which might be used to
write notes to the undersigned ap
prising liini of ideas on Association
activities. It would not be neces
sary to word such communications
in a suave or apologetic way, as we
are accustomed to doing business
with cold, hard facts. Inclosing it

may be well to repeat that this is
not intended to be taken as an ap
peal, nor yet as a request, but
merely as a suggestion. Any who
choose may continue with the
sledge hammer system without any
fear (or hope, where such be the
case) of breaking our back, as we
are here to stay.
Herbert F. Coolidge,
President Y. M. C. A.
