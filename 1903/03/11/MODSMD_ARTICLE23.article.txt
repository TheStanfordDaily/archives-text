from Scribners a copy of Tuer's
history of the Horn-book, in two

Education. A horn-book is a con
trivance which was u*ed before the
invention of printing as a school
book for bosy. In the first volume
of the history are three original
horn-books, one of leather-covered
oak, stamped with the effigy of
Charles II; one an early uncovered
horn-book in black letter; and one
an uncovered oaken horn-book of a
later period.
