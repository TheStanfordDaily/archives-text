# WORK ON THE DIAMOND.
## Men Are Slowly Getting Into Shape. Contests in Field and Pitcher's Box. 
### 
At the opening of the baseball
season a forecast of the strength of
the Cardinal on the diamond was
very encouraging. There were ten
Varsity men in college and Coach
Swindells had been secured for an
other season. The wet weather in
terfered very materially with the
early practices, and the work of the
last few weeks has been rather
mediocre. At present the Varsity
plays fairly well, hut is weak in the
field. McGilvray is not up to his
form of last season behind the bat,
but is rapidly rounding into shape.
Cowden is playing a good game at
first, but Captain Brown at second
has shown a decided tendency to
overthrow on fast plays to first
base. Crawford at short is pulling
up a stronger game than any man
of the infield. He is hitting the
ball fairly well, and handles his
chances with certainty and dis
patch. On third, Copp is playing
good ball and has overcome to
some extent the inability to hit
that he showed last season.
In the outfield the strongest fight
for positions is being made. Low
enthal is working at last year's
standard and seems to he a fixture
in left; but center and right are
still open to a fight. Of last year's
Varsity, Knight and Blake are in
the contest, and Ball, who caught
on the '01 team, is out for a place.
Of the other candidates, Wirt and
Williams, both Freshmen, are do
ing good work; Williams is strong
at the bat.
In the pitcher's box the fight has
narrowed down to four men, with
Parker in the lead. Although he
has no very hard curves, Parker
pitches effective ball and does well
at critical junctures. Of the other
men, Roosevelt lacks control, Sales
experience, and Tritch coolness.
Each of the three can pitch fairly
good ball, but at present Parker
seems to be the best man in the
field.
Asa whole the team is playing
rather loose ball. The game with
the Independents two weeks ago
was an exception to this rule. The
development in team-work has
heen rather slow, hut the material
is good and abundant, and the
coaching everything that could he
desired.
