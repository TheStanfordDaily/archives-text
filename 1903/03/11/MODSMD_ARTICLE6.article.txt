# SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Captain Bansbach's Plans to Develop Punting and Catching and Faster Team Work. 
### 
Light football work is to be in
augurated as soon after the Easter
vacation as possible. This is the
first time that any attention has
been given to football during the
spring semester, but Captain Bans
bach believes that the situation de
mands it this year, and conse
quently is planning to have four or
live weeks of easy work before col
lege closes for the summer vacation.
The great weakness of the team
last year lay in its poor offensive
ability. It lacked speed, and its
punters were not as good as they
might have been. In defensive
work the Stanford team was ex
cellent, but on the offensive it was
outdone by California. Overall
was off the line so quickly that it
ofttimes appeared as though he was
off-side. llis punting, too, was
better than that of the Stanford
men.
Captain Bansbach's efforts will
be devoted to overcoming these
vital defects as far as possible. It
is uncertain whether Magee will be
on the campus next semester, and
it is very important, therefore, that
good punters be developed. At the
same time, there will he beneficial
practice in catching and running.
To develop team speed Captain
Bansbach will not depend at the
present time upon practice in line
formation, but will put the men
upon the cinder-path. They will
be taught the art of fast starting
there, and it is believed that this
will help them greatly on the field.
All the work to he undertaken this
semester will be of a light charac
ter, and there will be no regular
training. Only such men as find
it convenient to do so will be ex
pected to appear.
