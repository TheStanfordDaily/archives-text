# CHESS WITH CALIFORNIA.
## Tournament for Choosing Team Now Being Played. â€” Chances for Winning Are Good. 
### 
The Intercollegiate chess team is
now being selected from the mem
bers of the Chess Club. The tour
nament by which it will be chosen
will end within two or three weeks,
in order to give the team a chance
to play together. The Intercolle
giate tournament will be held in
San Francisco April 3d. Califor
nia has been working hard with
her men. Over thirty players are
trying for the team, among whom
are all of last year's Intercollegiate
players. The State University has
won all the chess tournaments so
far, but Stanford's chances this
year are better than in former
years. All last year's team has
returned, with the addition of
F. W. Bennett, '03, who made the
team several years ago. F. P.
Whitaker, '04, is showing up well
in the tournament. After the se
lection of the first team a second
team will be organized to give prac
tice to the Varsity men. The men
making this team will receive some
insignia, probably a pin or button.
This system will be carried on next
year, so that men not good enough
to make the Varsity their first year
will have some incentive for prac
tice.
Tournaments for class champion
ships are also being played. The
winners of thes6 b tournaments and
the Varsity team are made perma
nent members of the club.
