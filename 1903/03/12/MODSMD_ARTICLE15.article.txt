In a few weeks, and the sooner
the better, the Sophomoreclass will
select the editor and business man
ager of next year's annual. The
class has no control over the action
of these officers. It sets the amount
of the assessments, but otherwise
has nothing to say concerning the
finances. The manager is respon
sible to no one, and yet the class
must stand whatever deficit results
from his management. The pres
ent Sophomore class has the op
portunity to remedy this unfair
state of affairs by the institution of
some businesslike system of class
control. It has been suggested
that the manager be placed under
bonds sufficient to cover any deficit
that might occur. There is a sys
tem in vogue at other colleges
which may well be putin operation
at Stanford: With the manager
and editor, a board of control, gen
erally with five members, is selected
to oversee their action and is respon
sible to the class for their misdeeds.
This board as a rule calls for
monthly reports from the manager.
In some colleges a committee is ap
pointed to havecharge of the publi
cation as class committees at Stan
ford have charge of class farces and
dances. Any one of these methods,
while it would not insure the class
against loss, would at least make a
deficit less liable to occur.
