The following is from the Uni
versity of Michigan News-Letter:
"The request of the present soph
omore class in the medical depart
ment of the University of Michi
gan, that it he allowed to conduct
its own examinations, has been
granted by the faculty. Six years
ago the medical class of 1899 made
a similar request, and all of its ex
aminations were thereafter con
ducted on the honor system.
"According to the rules drawn
up and accepted by the faculty, the
class of 1905 is to conduct its own
examinations. The professor in
charge of each course will distribute
his questions, and remain long
enough to explain whatever may
not be clear. Each member of the
class is to sign a statement in
which he pledges his word of honor
that he will neither accept nor give
any information during the exam
ination period, and further pledges
to report anyone whom he may
see using unfair methods. This re
port, if it becomes necessary to
make it, is to be made to a com
mittee of the class, which shall act
in secret. The person reported is
to be given a secret trial, in which
he may defend himself. The com
mittee is then to make a report to
the faculty on its findings, with
such suggestions as it may see fit
to add, whereupon the faculty is to
act as a court of higher appeal and
to render a final decision."
