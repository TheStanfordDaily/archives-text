to the Moral and Religious Life of
Man." On the speakers' list there
are a number of noted representa
tives of different religions. The
following men will have twenty
minutes each at their disposal for
their addresses:

Emlyn Lewys, B. A., who is to
represent the Jain religion of India,
studied for two years in London
with Vircliand R. Goudki, who
was present at the World's Parlia
ment of Religions in Chicago as the
representative of the Jains. Jain
ism was at one time a most power
ful religion in India, but is now
limited to about two million ad
herents. They lay great stress on
right knowledge, right belief, and
right conduct as the method of ob
taining liberation. The influence
of the Jains is far in excess of what
might be expected in view of their
small numbers. This is due to
their superior moral character.
About two-thirds of the monetary
transactions of India pass through
their ha nils.
Ram Swami, who will represent

losophy, particularly in regard to
its direct relation and contribution
