# Delay in Occupying Building.
## 
### 
The Natural Science departments
of the University have been plan
ning to move into the new quarters
in the Outer Quadrangle during the
Easter recess, but owing to the de
lay of the contractors there is now
small probability of this being
carried out until late in the semes
ter or during the summer. Not
more than two weeks would be re
quired to finish the buildings, yet
little or no work has been done on
them for nearly a month. The tile
floor of the exhibition room of the
Zoology building is not finished,
and the electric fixtures are not in
place.
The buildings were begun in the
spring of 1900.
