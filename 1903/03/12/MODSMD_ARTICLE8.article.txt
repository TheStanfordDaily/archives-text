# Trouble with Contractor.

Work upon the new tennis court

suspended. Geo. Goodman of San
Francisco, to whom the contract for
laying them was let, has found
that he had underestimated the
cost of building the courts $500.
His contract with the student body
provides for the construction of two
courts for $950. He now asks that
$500 in addition to the contract
price be allowed him. At the
meeting of the Executive Commit

night J. G. Dehy, '03, C. F. Ditt
mar, '03, and E. C. Beach, '05,
were appointed a committee to con
