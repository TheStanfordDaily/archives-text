Thk men who have taken up
basket-ball are working hard and
conscientiously, and the results thus
far have been very encouraging.
A week ago they played their first
game. They were beaten, but their
defeat was significant. They were
playing the most experienced team
on the Coast, yet the score by
which they were downed was only
26 to 19. That is not a bad begin
ning for a new team in its first
match game. Every sport that is
properly conducted, which gives
chances for fair contests, should be
encouraged. The game at Stan
ford is still young and not fully
appreciated by the student body.
