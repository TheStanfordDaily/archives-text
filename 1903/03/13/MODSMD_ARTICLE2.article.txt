# Side Chosen Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The thirteen debaters who will
enter the final try-put for the Inter
collegiate and Washington teams
are working day and night on the
Intercollegiate question. The sub
ject is one that involves no end of
research work, and there is a great
amount of reading that must be
done before a thorough understand
ing of the debate can be had. The
speakers are about evenly divided
in opinion as to choice of position,
and what will'- 1 be., the out
come of tomorrow's meeting
for choosing sides for the In
tercollegiate is doubtful. The
choice of sides must be wired to the
Htate University debaters tomorrow
evening at five o'clock.
The try-outs will no doubt be as
interesting a set of debates as have
been heard at Stanford for some
time. The contestants are nearly
all up to Varsity form, which
means that competition will be
keen and that the places on the
teams will be filled by those who
work the hardest in preparation.
