# STANFORD VS. SANTA CLARA.
## The
						Varsity Will Play the Fourth Game of Series on College Grounds. 
### 
The Varsity will go to Santa
Clara tomorrow to meet the college
hoys for the fourth game of the base
ball series between the two teams.
Although victroious in the first two
games, the college team suffered
defeat in the la√üt game by the score
of Bto 7. A victory by the Cardi
nal tomorrow will mean a tie that
the game of March 28th, the last
before the Intercollegiate contest,
will decide. * The practice of the
San Francisco professionals has
opened the eyes of the Varsity men
to many of the finer points of the
game, so that the team which goes
to Santa Clara tomorrow should be
materially stronger than the one
the college boys met in the last
game. The men will take the 12:56
train for Santa Clara, and will line
up against the college boys in the
following order:
STANFOIID. SANTA CLARA.
