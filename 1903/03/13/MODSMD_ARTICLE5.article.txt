# Lecture by Swami Ram.

### 
The Swami Ram, who will rep
resent the Vedanta religion at the
general conference of religions in
the Church tomorrow, spoke yes
terday in the chapel on the re
ligious outlook and the future of
the races of India. He made the
point that what India now needs
is not more philosophy, not more
missionaries. India is drugged
already with philosophy and re
ligious theory; but what the coun
try is thirsting for is the spirit of
freedom to live, to work, and to in
vestigate. Not more missionaries
to teach doctrine, but men of the
West to give India the practical
arts of living in this life are what
is needed. India is bound hand
and foot by the caste system. This
system paralyzes all activity and
even deadens a man's range of
thought. A Hindu cannot go out
riding with his wife without losing
caste. The system puts the land
in chains.
The way of deli verance. suggested
by the Swami Rani was the educa
tion of a large number of young
Hindus of the better class in the
universities of this country and
Europe. Here is freedom and an
outlook on the real facts of the
world. Young Hindus having ab
sorbed this spirit can return to
their native land and knowing the
people can far more effectively than
foreign missionaries, lead them to
the light.
