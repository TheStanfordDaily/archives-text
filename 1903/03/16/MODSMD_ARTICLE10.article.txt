# WOMEN'S EDITION.
## Stanford Daily Will be Turned Over for a Special Number. 
### 
Sometime next month the
women of the University will get
out a special edition of the Daily
Palo Alto, the present stuff for
the day giving way to a staff com
posed entirely of women. This is
the second time since the Daily
began publication that this has
been done. The other issue came
out December 10, 1897.
It will be entirely devoted to the
work of Stanford women in gradu
ate and undergraduate activities.
