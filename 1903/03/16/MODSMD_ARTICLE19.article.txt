# Scholarship Cards Are Out.
## 
### 
Mid-semester cards from the
faculty committee on scholarship
are out. Seven students have been
dropped from the University, six
of them regular students and one
a special. By major subjects they
were: Law, 3; Geology, 1; Chemis
try, 1; Civil Engineering, 1; Eco
nomics, 1.
Thirty-five warnings were given,
of which six were administered to
special students.
The committee has adopted a
ruling which materially changes
the status of those who are dropped
in the middle of the spring semes
ter. Hitherto they could not re
enter before January of the follow
ing rear. From now on, in Septem
ber of the next semester, they may
return, provided they take over
again all the two-semester courses
which they were carrying when
dropped.
