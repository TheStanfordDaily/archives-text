# SERMONS IN CHURCH.
## Jenkin Lloyd Jones Preached in the Morning.—Dr. H.W. Thomas on "The Things That Abide." 
### 
At the invitation of Dr. Newton,
Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jonee of Chicago
filled the pulpit of Memorial
Church Sunday morning. His
subject was"The Harmonies of
Worship," and he chose his text
from the 29th Psalm, "Worship the
Lord in the beauty of holiness."
"Reverence is the crowning grace
of life. Worship is the solvent that
everywhere breaks down the rock
of bigotry, and reverence it is that
makes melodious the iron bars of
creed. On the horizon line of hu
man ignorance, on the mountain
peaks of human aspiration, in the
deep valleys of humiliation, in the
lonely desires of the heart, there
are no sects, no partisanships, no
denominational antagonisms, no
race prejudices, and these are the
places where worship is inevitable
and prayer is spontaneous.
"The realm of human hopes,
fears, disappointments, and loves
is a realm unmarked by the lines
that bound in human fellowship
and divide the sons of men. From
this common ground springe poetry,
springs music; here is the soil
from which great character grows.
"Whatever we may think of
prayers, of formal words of ritual,
we must all believe in prayer, for
adoration in the presence of the
adorablfe is inevitable to spirit.
Gratitude, admiration, the hunger
for communion with the pure, the
thirst of the soul for companion
ship with the divine, represent the
soul at its maximum everywhere,
and this is the prayer exalting the
heart that yields to its law."
Dr. H. W. Thomas preached in
the afternoon on the subject of
"The Things That Abide." He
spoke of the trinity of Christian
virtues, faith, hope, and charity,
or love. In part he said: "The
world is in the midst of change; we
sometimes fear being swept off our
feet by the rush of these changes.
But there is cheer for our faith,
courage in the contemplation of the
things that abide. The generations,
the races of men, pass, but man
abides. The systems of philosophy
change, but the great laws of
thought, the general operations of
men's minds, through all ages re
main the same. We may confi
dently affirm some things about
human faith. Faith in a Supreme
Being, common to all the highest
races, emerging from the darkness
of ignfiilQice in every age, will not
pass away. Faith in the Christ
will abide—not the Christ of war
ring sects, of passing creeds, but
the Christ who was and is the Son
of Mani- While men may believe
at all, tTiey will believe in Him."
In the morning anthem, the
soprano solo was sung by Miss
Stella Sankey, '05.
