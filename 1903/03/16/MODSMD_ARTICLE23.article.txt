# CONGRESS OF RELIGION.
## Six Speakers of Different Faiths Present Views in Spirit of Fellowship. 
### 
The Saturday morning and after
noon sessions of the Congress of
Religion, an adjourned meeting
from the gathering in Los Angeles,
was an assembly unique in the
annals of Stanford. A priest of
Buddhism from Ceylon, Anagariba
Dharmapala; a devotee of the re
ligion of Jain, Dr. Emlyn Lewys;
the Swami Ram, representing the
Vedanta sect of India; and three
Christians, themselves representing
the movement toward the spirit of
unity in Christian denominations,
met in religious council to talk
over the things that their different
religions had given to the world,
and in a friendly way to learn of
each other.
Dr. Lewys spoke of the striving
of the followers of Jainism toward
moral perfection; the Swami Ram
of the essentially Christian prin
ciples of the Vedanta religion;
Anagariba Dharmapala of the
principle among the Buddhists
that "now is the accepted time," of
their doctrine of "do not delay" in
all good works.
In the afternoon the Christian
divines took up the subject. Dr.
Newton spoke of the general pur
pose of the congress, the idea to
bIiow that Christianity is not ex
clusive but inclusive of other re
ligions. Dr. Thomas declared that
all religions in their fundamentals
are one. "AH men are first human,
brothers; then Jew or Greek, Ro
man or barbarian, bond or Rlave,
Brahmin, Buddhist, Moslem, or
Christian" Dr. Jones closed the
assembly. Jn his address be
spoke of the shame to Christendom
of the different warring sects, and
of the essential unity of truth.
