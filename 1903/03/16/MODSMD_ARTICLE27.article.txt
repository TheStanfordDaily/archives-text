# Y.M.C.A. WINS BASKET-BALL.
## Gymnasium Club Defeated by Team From San Francisco by Score of 30 to 12. 
### 
A fair-sized crowd gathered in
Encina gymnasium to witness the
first basket-ball game with an out
side team on the Stanford campus.
Though the score is a big one, the
game was hotly contested from first
to last. The Basket-ball Club suf
fered from lack of experience. The
San Francisco team has been in
the league for years, and all its
players know the game. Captain
Col Iyer, '04, at center, played the
best game for the Basketball Club.
Though not aggressive enough,
he outplayed his man and made
three of Stanford's six goals. The
other three goals were made by
Beach, Lousley, and Gaboon.
Scholfield, '06, and Lousley, '05,
played strong, fast games; Schol
field was the most aggressive man
on the Stanford team. The Basket
ball Club was not penalized for
fouling; the Y. M. C. A. was fined
six times —twice for holding, and
four times for running with the
ball. The halves were twenty min
utes long. On the second half
Lousley, '05, replaced E. C. Beach,
and Cahoon, '06, replaced Stearns,
'06.
For the first halves the teams
were about evenly matched, the
score being 10 to 6 in the Y. M.
C. A.'B favor. But the visitors car
ried the club off its feet and ran up
a large score before the Stanford
team could rally. Although the
game waß badly against them, the
club men made several brilliant
rallies even late in the game.
The officials were: F. Shaw of San
Francisco, Y. M. C. A., referee; and
H. W. Chappel, '01, and Homer
Martin, '03, umpires.
