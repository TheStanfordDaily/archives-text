# VARSITY MEETS DEFEAT.
## Santa Clara College Nine Wins Contest and Series on Home Grounds. 
### 
The Varsity went to Santa Clara
Saturday and was defeated by the
college nine 6to 1 in a mediocre
contest. The series between the
two institutions goes to the Catholic
collegians, as they have won three
out of the five games scheduled.
The home team secured its lead in
second inning with h total of three
runs, while the Stanford team was
unable to add to its single tally
scored in the first inning by Brown.
After the second inning Stanford
settled down and played good, con
sistent ball. Stanford entered the
game without Crawford and Hall,
who were superseded by Williams
and Wirt. Both of the freshmen
played creditably. The detailed
