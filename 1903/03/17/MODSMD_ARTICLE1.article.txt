the situation.
The offer of the club reads as

"The Senior Club stands ready
to ttrrn over to pfou as a representa
tive of the football men a cup
which is to be offered for individual
excellence in a punting tourna
ment, the details and time of which
are to be arranged by you and a
cd'HuHjl'lM of .football men which
you may select. The tournament
is to be held annually, and records
made in games or at other times
are not to be considered in award

which is to be kept in the trophy

such as you suggest will be of ines
timable value to the football of the
future. The effects of the training
which the men will get will be
shown immediately in better play

Bome such incentive for several
years, and I know of nothing
which will be more effective.

exhibition at the Registrar's office.
