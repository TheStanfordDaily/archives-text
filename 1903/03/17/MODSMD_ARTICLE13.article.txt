That any Stanford mini will de
liberately light his pipe or cigarette
on the quad, by many is not to be
conceived, for those who have a
wholesome respect for the things
that mean much to Stanford, will
not break one of her traditions, and
do not like to believe that there
are students on the campus who
will break them. The man who
smokes on the quad is not a true
Stanford man, and he deserves the
censure of the student body as
much as does the man who breaks
training rules, and he should expect
it. The Daily Palo Ai.to has
never been called upon to publish
the names of the men who break
the tradition, for the "unwritten
law" has more behind it than the
sentiment of the student body.
The sentiment is as old as Stanford,
and has never before been as loose
ly regarded as at present.
