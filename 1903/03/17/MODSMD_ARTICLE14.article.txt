The Sophomore class has been at
Stanford long enough to know that
the pledging of votes and "working
elections" are nowise in keeping
with the real Stanford spirit. Dr.
Jordan, in speaking of the things
he did not like at Stanford, had
several things to say which every
Sophomore should think of before
the ballots are handed out. There
is nothing to be said against spir
ited contests; they are desirable, for
in spirited contests will the voter
become best informed concerning
the candidates; but every Stanford
man and woman should be against
''politics" as popularly understood.
The campaign preceding the Senior
election was the nearest to an ideal

campaign held 011 the campus for
several years. We would like to
see the Sophomore elections and
the spring student body elections
a furtherance of the principle
which seems lately to have taken
hold of a considerable portion of
the student body.
