# A 						New "Chapparal."

### 
What is undoubtedly the most
beautiful pen-and-ink drawing yet
made of a Stanford scene will ap
pear in tomorrow's Chaparral. It
is a full-page sketch of a boat-load
of Stanford people crossing La
gunita, by Borough, ex-'Ol. Other
features in sketch-work are by Miss
Lathrop, '00, and L. C. Hawley, '03.
In verse the place of honor is given
to a "Sonnet of a Sonny," by I). M.
Reynolds, '05. It deals in poetry
with the sort of child-life that has
been the feature of his Sequoia
stories. Dane Coolidge, '03, con
tributes an excellent Stanford song,
and C. S. Thompson writes a clever
parody entitled the "Night of the
Burnt Pretzels."
Editorically the paper knocks
the knockers who knock the knock
ers, and illustrates the benefits oi
judicious knocking by an indict men
against those who failed to respond
to the Band's effort to raise funds
to pay for its instruments. A
rather lengthy discussion is in
dulged in over the new Senior Club
and its supposed incentives, and a
repl}' is made to the Sequoia's as
sertion that Stanford is not over
burdened with activities.
