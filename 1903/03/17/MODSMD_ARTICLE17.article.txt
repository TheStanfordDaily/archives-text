Grand total $1186 13
Although the student body opens
the month of March with an appar
ent favorable balance of $433.63, it
is $1000 in debt to the training
house corporation on a note bearing
interest at five per cent. At the

same tune last year we had some
$188 in the treasury, but all of the
outstanding bills had not been
paid. This year all bills for sup
plies have been paid up to Febru
ary Ist, otherwise there would be a
larger balance than at the corre
sponding time last season.
The student body turns over to
the training-house corporation
every year about $1300 —being all
student body assessments and five
per cent of the gross receipts of all
money laken in at the games, con
certs, etc. This fund is to be used
in improving the grounds of the
new athletic field. When they are
once completed the student body
should be in a position to end every
season with a balance in the bank.
There is need this year, particu
larly during (he spring semester, of
economy in every deyartment, and
of the full support and co-operation
of the student body in all athletic
events. Harry J. Edwards,
Treasurer.

Balance on hand 433 63
Grand total $1186 13
Although the student body opens
the month of March with an appar
ent favorable balance of $433.63, it
is $1000 in debt to the training
house corporation on a note bearing
interest at five per cent. At the

same tune last year we had some
$188 in the treasury, but all of the
outstanding bills had not been
paid. This year all bills for sup
plies have been paid up to Febru
ary Ist, otherwise there would be a
larger balance than at the corre
sponding time last season.
The student body turns over to
the training-house corporation
every year about $1300 —being all
student body assessments and five
per cent of the gross receipts of all
money laken in at the games, con
certs, etc. This fund is to be used
in improving the grounds of the
new athletic field. When they are
once completed the student body
should be in a position to end every
season with a balance in the bank.
There is need this year, particu
larly during (he spring semester, of
economy in every deyartment, and
of the full support and co-operation
of the student body in all athletic
events. Harry J. Edwards,
Treasurer.
