# ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL.
## Game Will Be Played on the Baseball Grounds Saturday by the California League. 
### 
An association football game will
be played by two teams belonging
to the(Jalifornia Association League
on the Stanford baseball grounds
next Saturday, March '21st, follow
ing the baseball game. The kick
off will occur promptly at four
o'clock. Association football has
been attracting much attention of
late, and it is said to be displacing
the Rugby game in England. The
teams that will play next Saturday
are composed largely of business
men and mechanics of San Fran
cisco, many of them Britons. The
object of the visit is to demonstrate
to Stanford men some of the ad
vantages of the association game.
A game was played at Berkeley two
weeks ago and aroused much en
thusiasm.
Association football is played on
grounds lined in the form of a par
allelogram 120 yards long and 80
yards wide. A goal is located at
each end equi-distant from the
sides. Each consists of two up
right posts 8 feet high and 8
yards apart, a crossbar extending
from the top of one upright to the
other. Goal-making is accom
plished by passing the ball between
the upright posts and under the
crossbar. A team contains eleven
members, namely, one goal-keeper,
two fullbacks, three halfbacks, and
live forwards. The ball used is a
perfect sphere weighing 15 ounces.
No player, save a goal-keeper, is
allowed to use his hands or arms in
interference or to stop or drive the
ball. He may use his head and
shoulders or any part of his body,
legs, and feet to arrest or punt the
ball. The body only must be used
in interference. The goal-keeper is
privileged to use all his limbs to
arrest or »hive the ball.
Association football's attractions
and advantages to spectators and
players are that the ball, while
within bounds, is always moving
and the players are in constant
a,ction, and every movement on the
field is visible to the onlookers.
Half the time the ball is in the air,
and the scene of the struggle for
supremacy is constantly changing.
Association football requires agility,

courage, alertness, Ueetness, and a
perfect control of the feet on 'the
part of the players. Weight is not
essential, hence any man can take
it up. Roughing it is not permissi
ble, even in the scrimmages, there
fore accidents are rare and guards
are not needed for the protection of
any part of the body except the
shins.
