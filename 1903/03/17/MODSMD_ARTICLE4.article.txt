# TALKS IN CHAPEL.
## President Slocum Spoke Briefly. Rev. Jones Discussed Essentials of Character. 
### 
In the chapel at 1:30 yesterday
President Slocum, D.D., L.L.D.,
of Colorado College, spoke inform
ally for fifteen minutes and gave
way to Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones,
who talked on "Character."
Dr. Slocum emphasized the im
portance of the work the universi
ties and colleges are doing for the
unification of our country. "The
fact that students of the great uni
versities are finding their way into
the colleges of the country as in
structors, each with a certain defi
nite message, is a force that helps
in this movement of unification.
The colleges of the Middle West are
grateful to Stanford for the work
that it is doing for them, stimulat
ing them by its example of sturdy
and independent growth. Its work
belongs not to California alone nor
to the Pacific Coast, but to America.
"The most encouraging sign of
today is the development of sec
tionalism. We used to think that
sectionalism meant the destruction
of national unity. But our sections
are no longer limited by state
boundaries. We now speak of the
Pacific Coast, the Northwest, and
the Atlantic seaboard. Our loyalty
to sections makes for loyalty to the
nation as a whole. Never was
there such intense loyalty in
America as at the present time."
Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones spoke
from the theme "For 1 Seek not
Yours but You." "Character is
the coming word in religion, poli
tics, and education. It is not in
our creeds, but it is that for which
we are all working. We cannot
find a definition for it. Primary,
fundamental things cannot be de
lined. It is not culture, not creed,
not position, —but you. We have a
fair knowledge of what lies at the
bottom of the sea, but none of
what is in the depths of the human
heart. Character deals with funda
mentals. The elements that enter
into character are easily recogniz- j
able. The first is integrity —whole-
ness. Character demands circular
growth, not sharpness nor smart
ness. It calls for the full develop
ment of our powers. Next in im
portance is the quality of action —
momentum. Inspiration is ex
pressed not only by the tongue and
pen, but bv the whole body.
Courage is another factor; there is
small room in the world for a
coward, Reverence is also im
portant. It is that sense of sacred
ness, of appreciation of the great
mystery and majesty of life.
"Some of the foes of character are
bigotry, formalism, emotionalism;
its help, the sense of the sanctity
of the now. We are interested in
history and prophecy, but we must
live now. School life is prepara
tion, but it is also life."
