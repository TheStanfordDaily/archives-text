The string instruments are par
ticularly strong, the brass is fully
represented, and the wood-wind is
also good. One of the best orches
tral numbers will be Verdi's

the clarionet and flute solo work in
the overture to the "Bohemian
Girl." R. J. Hughes,'o3, will play
the cornet solo in the "Feast of
Lanterns."
The overture from the "Antigone"
of Mendelssohn will be rendeied,
and the Bacchus chorus and Eros
will be sung by the chorus with
orchestral accompaniment.
Miss Dorothy Goodsell, solo so
prano of Plymouth Church, Oak
land, will sing Chaminades' "Sum
mer." L, Arditis, "11 Baccio" and
Nevins' "Rosary." Mr. H. H.
