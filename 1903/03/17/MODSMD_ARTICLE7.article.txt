### 
At a meeting of California men
interested in history, held at the
University Club in San Francisco
Monday, February 23d, it was de
termined to issue a circular for the
purpose of reviving the California
Historical Society. This society,
first organized in 1852, arid incor
porated in 1870, was in active ex
istence from 1886 to 1895, and dur
ing that time published much val
uable historical material. It was
proposed by those present that a
meeting of the members of the
society and all those interested in
the study of history, be held in San
Francisco in the near future. That
at that meeting a new board of di
rectors be elected, and that the by
laws of the society be amended so
that the annual fee be reduced to
$3.
At the same time, it is intended
that the members of the American
Historical Association, of whom
about seventy are resident upon
the Pacific Coast, shall organize
themselves into a Pacific Coast
Branch. It has been suggested that
those persons interested in history
who desire to become members both
of the California Historical Society
and of the American Historical As
sociation may do so upon payment
of an annual fee of $5.
Those who were present at the
meeting last Monday were the fol
lowing: David Starr Jordan, Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler, John T. Doyle,
Max Farrand, Thomas R. Bacon,
H. Morse Stephens, George David
son, Rev. W. A. Brewer, James V.
Coffey, Horace Davis, Ralph C.
Harrison, and Robert C. Thomp
son.
