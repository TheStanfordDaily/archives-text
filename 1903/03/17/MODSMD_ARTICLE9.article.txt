# Will Resume Work on Courts.
## 
### 
The committee appointed by the
Executive Committee to confer with
Contractor Goodman regarding the
delay in building the new tennis
courts has met Goodman and the
difficulties have been adjusted. The
underestimate of $400 made by
Goodman in calculating the cost of
construction was due to a misun
derstanding between Goodman and
the city firm whom he had hired to
lay the bitumen upon the courts.
This firm understood that the work
was to be done in San Francisco,
and when they found it was to be
performed here the rate which they
had intended to charge Goodman
was doubled. To be released from
his contract Goodman has offered
to get the three courts ready for
the bitumen free of charge. This
will cost him about $200, â€”a clear
loss. This compromise will be
accepted by the Executive Com
mittee and the work will be re
sumed as soon as the ground dries
sufficiently to permit. Two days
will be required for Goodman's
part of the work. The bitumen
laying will he given to some firm
yet to be chosen.
