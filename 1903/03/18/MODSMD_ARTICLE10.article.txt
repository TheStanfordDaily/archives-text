The loss of Freshman Turpin
seriously damages the chances of
the Cardinal in the short sprints.
Turpin has run several trials in the
hundred in less than 10 1-5 sec
onds, and once ran close to 10 sec
onds. Such a man had brilliant
opportunities, and it was confi
dently expected that he would be
close to the front in the finishes of
the hundred and two-twenty dashes.
The rain spoiled last Saturday's
meet with Ukiah high school, and
now there will in all probability be
no meets before the Interclass on
Junior Day. The time up to then
will be taken up with regular work.
There will be several good trials
Saturday, by which a line may be
had on the result of the meet be
tween the classes. At present it
looks as though the Senior class
will carry off the championship.
For three years'o3 has almost won.
This year the Senior team is
stronger than ever before. How
ever, the Junior class has nearly
all of its performers, and the meet
should be a fast and close one.
Dunn, '04, Smith, '03, and Cross
man, '04, in the quarter, ought to
make as fast a race as can be seen on
the Coast. All three men will run
under 51 seconds. Weller, '06,
Lyons, '03, and Henley, '04, will
make interesting work in the
broad jump. Every event will be
holly contested, and those interest
ed in track will walcli the trials of
I the coming ten days with interest.
