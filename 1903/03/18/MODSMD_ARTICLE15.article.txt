'J 1 he Sophomore class this after
noon did two commendable things:
it declared that none but those who
paid the class assessment will
be allowed a ballot in the coming
election, and decided to put the
business manager under bond√ü.
The man or woman who does not
support the class financially has
no right to expect the privilege of
voting. The adoption of similar
resolutions by the Senior and
Junior classes was found to be
effective. By placing the manager
under bonds the members of the
class secure themselves against a
heavy senior assessment.
