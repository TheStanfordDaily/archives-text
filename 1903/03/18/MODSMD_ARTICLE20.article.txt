# DELAY IN BUILDING.
## Changes in Plana Cause Work on New Library to be Postponed. 
### 
The delay in getting the new
Library building started is due to
the change Mrs. Stanford has di
rected Architect Clinton Day to
make in the plans for the exterior
of the building. As originally
planned the front of the structure
was classical style, designed some
what like the exterior of the new
Gymnasium and the Museum.
There were six large columns pro
vided for, in addition to severa-l
other features of distinctly Greecian
outline. After deliberating on the
question some time Mrs. Stanford
ordered a change to be made, and
the new Library is to be Spanish in
its exterior plan. No changes in
the interior equipment and arrange
ment will be made.
In general outline the plans now
being prepared in San Francisco
call for a building very similar to
the design of the one which was on
exhibition in the windows of the
Registrar's office recently. The
structure is to be two stories in
height with a large central dome
over the main reading room, which
is reached through the main en
trance. The smaller departmental
reference and reading rooms, which
are entered without access to the
main library, are to the right and
left.
It is expected that very soon the
completed plans and specifications
will go into the hands of the con
tractors for bids. Until recently
the intention was to break ground
this semester, but owing to the de
lay in getting plans completed it is
probable that no work will be done
until next fall.
