# Benefits of College Education.

### 
The new edition of "Who's Who
in America" contains some figures
of interest to college men. It is
estimated that there are about

46,000,000 men over 21 years old
in the United Slates. Of these
1,071,201 are college educated,
2,165,351 have high school educa
tions, 32,862,851 have only received
common school training, and
4,682,498 are enterely without
school education.
Of these different classes the col
lege educated portion, although
much smaller, has contributed
5,768 "notables" to "Who's Who in
America." Those who have re
ceived high school educations are
represented by 1,245 persons, the
common schools have contributed
808, while those who have received
no school training are represented
by only 31.
From these statistics it is shown
that a college education increases
the chances of a high school boy
9 times, giving him 219 times the
chance afforded by the common
school education, and 800 times the
opportunity of the untrained boy.
