# Work in the Foundry.

### 
The Foundry has turned out a
considerable number of castings,
including the accessories for the
shafting in the Pattern Shop, such
as hangers, pulleys, and oil-cups; a
number of brackets for holding
wrought-iron in the Machine Shop;
four wheels for a truck; and twenty
cone pulleys, not all finished.
These castings have been made
from patterns turned out by stu
dents. A twelve-inch half-pipe,
for which no pattern is necessary,
is being made to replace the present
tiling cover of the brass-furnace.
Probably the biggest piece of work
that has yet gone to the ,Foundry
is that of moulding forty-eight cor
rugated plates to cover over the
pipe-trench in the Mechanical lab
oratory. One of these plates has
already been successfully cast.
Plans are now in the Pattern Shop
for the patterns of plates to cover
the pipe-trench in the boiler-room.
These plates, twelve in number, are
about half the width of those for
the Mechanical laboratory.
