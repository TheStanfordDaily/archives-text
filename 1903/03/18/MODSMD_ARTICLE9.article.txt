# VARSITY VS. PROFESSIONALS.
## Second Game to be Played Thursday Afternoon on Campus Diamond. 
### 
At 3:30 tomorrow afternoon the
Varsity will line up against the
San Francisco professionals for the
second game of the series. Yester
day's contest was more one-sided
than the score, 7 to 0, would seem
to suggest, as the big leaguers did
not play the fast ball of which they
are capable. The Varsity should
play a more certain game tomorrow
and make the contest closer. The
loss of Crawford, who was playing
the star game of the infield, was
easily to be seen, but with
time and practice Williams and
Ball should prove a strong combi
nation at second and short, Brown
having gone to center-field. Both
men are strong at bat and as soon
as they learn to work together well
should cover the center of the in
field in an effective manner. To
morrow's game will show in a
measure what the team can do after
the first newness of the shake-up
has had time to wear off. The
teams will probably line up in the
following order:
