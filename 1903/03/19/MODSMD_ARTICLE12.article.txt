There is among many students
who have not yet learned what
Stanford is, a lack of the feeling of
personal responsibility in regard to
undergraduate activities. Each
and every organization contributes
a certain amount to Stanford life,
and helps to make Stanford life
what it is. All of them should
have a definite end and aim: the
betterment and strengthening of
our college spirit. It remains for
each activity to work for the wel
fare of every other activity, and by
consciously so doing can the most
good be done. When a fraternity
declares that it will not attend a
concert or a dance given by a stu
dent body organization; when any
organization or class committee de
clares that it will not do things at
Stanford as Stanford has been ac
customed to having things done—
and as they should be done—influ
ences are being used against the
highest possible growth and fullest
development of that comity of
spirit for which we should strive.
Apropos of the controversy be
tween our sister publications, the
Chaparral and tlie Sequoia, in
regard to Stanford organizations,
we add a word. When an organi
zation is run on Stanford princi
ples, is working primarily for
Stanford, and gives its members
training and a better knowledge of
the inside life of the University, it
is worthy of support and commen
dation. It is when an organization
allows itself to degenerate into per
sonalities, when it loses sight of
Stanford, that it should be "taken
to the edge of the campus and
dropped off." Fortunately, at Stan
ford such organizations, if there are
any, are few. Sometimes tempor
arily, a class or an organization
may seem to be working with per
sonal ends in view, or may be sol

ineffectively represented by com
mittees or officers that they do not
seem to hold the proper attitude
toward other student activities; but
in the main .Stanford organizations
are doing their work well and are
necessary and useful adjuncts to
Stanford life.
