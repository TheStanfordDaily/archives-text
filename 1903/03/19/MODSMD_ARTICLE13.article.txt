On account of the Sophomore-

afternoon of March 28th, the play
will be given in the evening—not,
as has been announced, in the

has undertaken to provide accom
modations for all those taking part
in the performance. Each partici
pant therefore is requested to send
his name to the undersigned stat
ing whether he desires to have the
committee find accommodations for
him, and mentioning fraternity
affiliations, if any. There will be
a rehearsal in Assembly Hall Fri
day afternoon at 2 o'clock; and the
committee will assume that, each
one sending in his name will at
tend the rehearsal prepared in his
lines—if he has a speaking part.
It will save delay if these notices
are sent immediately.
S. S. Seward, Jr.
