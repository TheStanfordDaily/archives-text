# Talk on Cecil Rhodes.
## 
### 
Dr. Adrian Hoffmeyr this after
noon spoke for the third time he
fore the University, his Buhject be
ing "Cecil Rhodes." Dr. Hoffmeyr
was a close intimate of Cecil
Rhodes, and his talk this afternoon
was largely in the nature of per
sonal reminiscences. He spoke of
Rhodes' career as a politician, and
briefly of his career as a financier,
summarizing the latter phase in
the words, ''Everything the man
took up seemed to turn to gold.''
He also defended Rhodes' memory
in the matter of honesty, saying
that not even the man's bitterest
enemy in South Africa would im
peach him in this respect. Rhodes'
connection with the Jameson raid
was the subject of naive remarks.
Dr. Hoffmeyr candidly acknowl
eged that this was the fault of
Rhodes' life. Hut he viewed this
incident with a friend's eyes. He
related with positive glee how Mr.
Rhodes was baited by the solemn
assemblage of notables in England,
the committee appointed to ex
amine him at the time of the
Jameson raid. The whole proceed
ings of this trial in England were
largely in the nature of an inter
national farce. England was try
ing to spank her children for at
tempting to do exactly what she
wanted them to do. When Mr.
Laboucher asked Cecil Rhodes if
lie had not lost some money in the
Jameson raid, the millionaire only
laughed and said: "You ask me if
I lost any money? Why, I finan
ciered the whole expedition. My
expenses before I was through with
the thing were half a million
pounds."
Rhodes connection with it was
worse than a crime; it was a blun
der. Rhodes nobly retrieved
whatever loss he sustained in
personal character by his faithful
ness to Jameson in his hour of dis
grace, and later by his heroic jour
ney single-handed among the wild
tribes or Matabeleland when the
natives were rising to go on the
warpath against the whites. This
daring journey and its successful
issue won for Cecil Rhodes the
thanks of all South Africa and
made him like a father to the dark
tribesmen.
