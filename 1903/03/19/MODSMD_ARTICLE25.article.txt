The Varsity and Second team
were put through a hard practice
on the diamond last night. Sales,
Parker, Roosevelt, and Tritch were
all given a few innings in the hox,
and all worked hard to keep down,
the hits. The Varsity showed that
it is rounding into shape in good
form. The new combination at
second and short is in need of prac
tice, hut should cover the ground
effectively before the first-of the I
Intercollegiate games, lirown is a
known quantity at center-field. He;
is certain on flies and has a strong
arm for throwing to the plate.:
Crawford, who has played the best
game of any man on the team
throughout the treason, has decided j
to retain his amateur standing. He,
was made offers by both the Lob-
Angeles and Portland professionals, j
but refuged them.
The leaguers will soon leave for
San Francisco for the opening of
the baseball season.
There is but little over two
weeks before the first Intercollegiate
game on the Berkeley campus. As ,
yet the team is not definitely
chosen nor the Varsity pitcher
selected; but the remaining period,
devoted to hard practice, should
give the Cardinal a strong team.
