# READING OF ULYSSES.
## Professor Clark of the University of Chicago Will Present Parts of Stephen Phillips' Drama. 
### 
Under the auspices of the Eng
lish Club, tomorrow afternoon at
1:30 Prof. S. H. Clark of the Uni
versity of Chicago will read Stephen
Phillips' " Ulysses." A year ago
another of Phillips' plays, "Paolo
and Francesca," was read by Mrs.
F. J. Rogers. The reading tomor
row will be very much of the same
character.
Professor Clark is a man of
splendid appearance, and is a lead
er among elocutionists, probably as
a reader without a superior in
America. This is his first public
appearance at Stanford.
Stephen Phillips,author of" Ulys
ses", charmed the literary world
with "Paolo and Francesca" seven
years ago, but it was not staged un
til last year, when it was produced
with much magnificence in Lon
don. "Ulysses'' an an acting play
is much better than "Paolo and
Francesca," or Phillips' second
play, "Herod."
In "Ulysses," his latest effort,
Stephen Phillips has introduced
some novel features. His romantic
treatment of a classical subject is
unique. He has sought to return
to the classical spirit of the drama,
as characterized by severe simpli
city and tragic interest. Unlike
the usual classic drama, it contains
a good deal of humor and some
comic situations. In his introduc
tion of the old Greek gods and their
messengers, Phillips has been al
most as daring as Milton in his
conception of God in "Paradise
Lost."
The scene of the prologue is on
the summit of Mount Olympus,
and all of its characters are super
natural. This Burpernalural ele
ment continues throughout the
play proper. These preternatural
beings are handled with exquisite
grace; they are neither flat nor
grotesque.
Only a small proportion of the
Homeric story is used. Action
centers on the episode of Ulysses
and Calypso, on the enchanted is
land, Ulysses' descent into Hades,
and the destruction of the suitors
in the palace of Ulysses iat Ithaca.
All the other adventures chronicled
by Homer are omitted.
