# BOATING UPON LAGUNITA.
## Two Pair-Oared Barges Will be Secured for Preliminary Practice Upon the Lake. 
### 
Definite steps are being taken to
ward firmly establishing rowing at
Stanford, and it is probable that
the next few weeks will see a start.
Professor A. \V. Smith, who is the
leader of the movement, is anxious
to make a beginning this semester
in order to work up interest in the
sport, and with that end in view
he has formulated definite plans.
It is proposed to hire two pair
oared boats for use on Lagunita,
and it is hoped that these will be
ready immediately after the Easter
vacation. Professor Smith thinks
that very good work can be done
with these. Lagunita affords a
stretch of about a quarter of a mile,
and stakes will be placed so that a
fairly good course of half a mile
can be secured. Besides the two
rowers, there will be a coxswain in
each boat. There will be work on
the lake in these boats every after
noon under the direction of Pro
fessor Smith, who is an old Cornell
oarsman, or of some other compe
tent director. There are in the Uni
versity now many men who have
had experience in rowing, and
many others are taking an inter
est in the sport, so that there will
be no lack of material.
Resides this work on the lake, a
four-oared barge will he obtained
for use on the slough at the foot of
the Embarcadero road, and the
best men will be taken down there
once or twice a week for practice
under less restricted conditions.
In addition, some work will be
done on the rowing machines io
the gymnasium. These machines
are now being altered so that
sweep oars may be used upon them,
and Professor Smith will be at the
gymnasium every afternoon at 4:30
to give instruction. A great deal
in the way of preliminary training
can be accomplished in this way.
It is to be hoped that there will be
class contests upon the lake before
the close of the semester. Thejmen
may gain experience enough to
warrant such contests.
