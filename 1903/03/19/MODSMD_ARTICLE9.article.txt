# Renew Work on Courts.
## 
### 
The contract for the completion
of the work on the new tennis
courts has been let to D. E. Brown,
'97, and work has been commenced.
There is to be a three-inch layer of
concrete and an inch and a half of
bitumen over the foundation of
gravel already put down. It is
expected that the courts will be
finished by the end of next week,
giving the tennis men three weeks
in which to prepare for the Inter
collegiate meet. Those responsible
for collection of tennis subscrip
tions will hand their funds to
Treasurer Edwards immediately.
