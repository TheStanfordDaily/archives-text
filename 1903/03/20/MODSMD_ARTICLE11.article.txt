# BASKET-BALL GAME.
## Encina Gymnasium Club Plays Oakland Y.M.C.A. Tomorrow Night. 
### 
The Encina Gymnasium Club
basket-ball team will meet the Cak
land Y. M. C. A. in Encina gym
nasium at eight o'clock. The Stan
ford team is improving fast and
has taken many lessons to heart
which the last games have taught.
The men are in good condition and
very fast, and are accurate in pitch
ing baskets. While they have been
careful to play a clean, fair game,
they are getting more aggressive.
The Oakland team plays the same
style of game as the club team.
Both teams rely more on speed and
accuracy than on roughness. The
game tomorrow evening will give
friends of the sport an opportunity
to get a line on the Stanford club's
chances with the State University.
Oakland defeated the club by a
close score recently, and was in
turn defeated by the University of
California Basket-ball Club team.
Judging from the number of
tickets sold there will be a large
crowd to witness the game. The
line-up of the opposing teams is as
follows:
Oakland Y. M. C.A. — Forwards,
Burke, Menzies, Farrish; center
0. Kurtz; guards, Rode, W. Kurtz.
