Tomorrow will be a full day on
the campus. By trials on the track
and a handball tournament in the
morning, a baseball and a football
game on the diamond in the after
noon, and a basket-ball game in
the evening, many athletic activi
ties will be represented The foot
ball game on the diamond at four
o'clock will be played by two San
Francisco teams, at the instigation
of admirers of the sport who hope
at sometime in the future to see
the association game become an in
tercollegiate event. That it is a
game requiring skill and endur
ance is not to he questioned, but
whether it should supersede the
game of today is still to be worked
out in American colleges. Its dev
otees declare that it will supersede
the American game. Stanford men
and women will have the oppor
tunity of judging the game for
themselves.
