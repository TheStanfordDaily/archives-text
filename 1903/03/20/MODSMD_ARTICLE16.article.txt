Thk fact lhat the date of the
first Intercollegiate baseball game
is but two weeks distant has given
rise to much comment over the
absence of any organized rooting at
practices and the games. There has
been a deplorable apathy on the
part of the students in this regard
all semester. Especially necessary
is encouragement for the players at
their daily work, and from now on
the final struggles of the Varsity
ought to receive the enthusiastic
support of the college. The first
contest is on the Berkeley campus,
which makes it all the more im
portant that rallies should be
the rule each evening for the
next week, since the spring vaca
tion will find fewer students pres
ent to attend the practices. The
California students have already
held large rallies on the bleachers.
