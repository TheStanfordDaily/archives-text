# Reading of "Ulysses."
## 
### 
Prof. S. H. Clark of the Univer
sity of Chicago read Stephen
Phillips' "Ulysses" this afternoon
lo an audience which filled the
chapel. His renditions were ap
plauded. "Ulysses" is a powerful
drama and it Inst nothing and
seemed better after Professor Clark
had interpreted parts of it. He
commenced at the first act, omit

ting the prologue. The first scene,
where Pallas Athene appears at
Ithaca;Ulysses'trip through Hades;
and the final scene with the suitors,
were read. The change of charac
ter in Ulysses' son, so subtle as to
be hardly detected in the lines of
the drama,was artistically revealed
by the voice of the reader.
Between the second and third
acts Professor Clark said: "The
vocal interpretation of English is
gradually becoming of great im
portance. Mo6t of our master
poetry reads well aloud, and a
drama cannot be fully appreciated
until it has been seen and heard.''
