# Herrmann Riotte's Readings.
## 
### 
The program of the readings
from German poetry, which will be
given Tuesday evening in the
chapel by Herr Herrman Riotte,
will be printed Monday evening.
The program will be particularly
interesting to students and lovers
of German poetry.
Before Herr Riotte started on his
present tour of the United States,
Hon. Carl Schurz of New York
wrote him the following: "I wish
you all the success on your trip
which your recognized artistic
achievement deserves. I hope that
wherever you find friends of mine
in the United States, they will give
you all the attention and support
which you could expect from me
personally."
When Herr Riotte came to Amer
ica for the first time in 1890, Dr.
Goebel wrote the following account
of one of Riotte's readings, in the
journal which he was then editing
in New York: "The artist had
chosen a rich program, which gave
him an opportunity of showing his
many-sided talents. He possesses
a most sympathetic, excellently
trained voice, by which he is able
to express the finest shadings of
the poets' meaning; besides, he has
in an unusual measure the gift of
characterization and plastic repre
sentation. The latter manifested
itself especially in his presentation
of the great scene from 'Tell,' where
the latter shoots the apple from
the bead of bis boy. Herr Riotte's
best achievement was, however, in
my opinion, his recitation —he al
ways reciter from memory—of the
'Lorelei,' and the 'Tauger's-Fluch,'
by Uhland. It seemed ns if the
words of the poet were tran 'formed
into music, and he must indeed be
pitied who, after hearing poems
like these, should still question the
musical beauties of the German
language."
