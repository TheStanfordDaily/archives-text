The results of the debating trials
Saturday night are ample tecti
mony that the University will he
admirably represented in its com
ing forensic contests with Califor
nia and Washington. Congratula
tions are due particulary to the
successful ones, while no small
amount of praise should be given
those not fortunate in making
either team, but whose efforts Sat
urday night show them to be ma
terial for future debates. The hold
that this college activity has on
Stanford is well attested in the
large and strong body of under
graduate speakers that contested
at the trials; yet the interest of the
student body at large is not what
it ought to be. There has been an
increase in interest in the activity
this year, which if properly nurtur
ed will grow stronger each year.
