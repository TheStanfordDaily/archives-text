The Sophomores after a few
days' deliberation have decided to
substitute committee censorship
for bonds as a means of control
over Quad managers, a reversal of
judgment being reached somewhat
suddenly today at the meeting
which was called according to
announcement, for the considera
tion of the conditions under which
the bonds were to be given. While
either plan is certain to eliminate
danger of deficits, yet the adoption
of a plan which had so recently
been turned down at an open
meeting of the class has caused
considerable adverse criticism.
This criticism has come not so
much because the new means of
control is not the most advisable,
for in many respects it is the most
advisable of the two, but it has
come because such actions should
be discouraged on principle. When

a class has expressed ils opinion
no such procedure as was carried
on today should be tolerated with
out a fair notice has first been giv
en, so that each side may lie repre
sented satisfactorily.
