# PREACHES ON "INSPIRARION."
## Dr. Newton Shows Lessons in Great Truths.—Chaplain Gardner on Phase of Moral Law. 
### 
Dr. Newton yesterday, preached
on "Inspiration," taking as his
text the words from Job 32:8:
"There is a spirit in man. And
the inspiration of the Almighty
giveth them understanding."
"There is a Divine Being back of
nature and within man, the life
and soul of all existence; the intel
ligence thinking out its laws; the
will energizing its forces. Such
high truths as these do we confess
when, walking in the light, we
affirm our belief in inspiration.
"'God speaks in the Bible,' thus
said our fathers and thus say we;
but mark well the limitation of the
statement. Wherever there is a
Hash of light, spiritual or ethical;
wherever the dark problems of
man's origin and nature and des
tiny grow luminous; wherever the
being and personality of God come
forth from the darkness—there is a
real revelation to our spirits of
truths unveiled ages ago to Hebrew
saints and Beers. Another step in
our progress into the true doctrine
of inspiration is the recognition
that there is a divine inspiration in
other sacred books than our own.
Who can deny the character of in
spiration to such words as these:
'Hail, great King and Father !
Grant us thy assistance in the
founding and directing of our judg
ment, and enlighten us with thy
truth, that we may discern those
things which are really good; and,
having discerned them, may love
them and cleave steadfast to the
same.'
"How can we deny inspiration
to that wise and holy teacher who
was sent to Athens and who was
put to death 'at the hands of sinful
men.' Let us take another step
upward in the true idea of inspira
tion. God has spoken, we say, to
the ancients. 'Holy men spoke of
old as they were moved by the
Holy Ghost.' But the age of in
spiration is past. The Book of
Revelation, closing the New Testa
ment, is the swan-song of the Holy
Ghost. Blasphemy is the folly of
a thoroughly atheistical orthodoxy.
"There is no line which can be
drawn around the sphere of divine
action. You cannot shut the Most
High up to any petty provincial
isms. You cannot keep God out of
his own world. How lofty human
life becomes, in this sense of divine
inspirations!"
Sunday afternoon Chaplain Gard
ner delivered an address on the
commandment "Thou shalt not
commit adultery." This was the
third of a series of addresses on the
moral law. He commented strongly
on the laxity of public sentiment
in regard to the divorce evil, and
quoted statistics to show the extent
of the evil. He attributed the
prevalence of divorce to the light
ness with which the marriage con
tract is regarded. As a remedy,
Chaplain Gardner suggested a uni
form divorce law, but he acknowl
edged that the evil could only be
extirpated by the proper education
of public sentiment.
