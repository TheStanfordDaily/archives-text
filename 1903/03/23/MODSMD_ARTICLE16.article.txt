# Association Football Game.
## 
### 
The exhibition game of associa
tion football played on the campus
Saturday afternoon proved an in
teresting affair. It was intended
as an object-lesson to bring the ad
vantages of this form of football
before the students, and the game
was followed with interest by a
large number of men and women.
It was unfortunate that the play
for a large part of the time was
upon the far side of the field, so
that it was difficult at times to see,
but this could not be avoided.
The contestants were all mem
bers of the California Association j
Football Leagueâ€”one team, the 1
Rifles, being a regular one, and the
other a picked eleven. Dr. Frank
Angell kicked off. The second!
team played the hardest, most ag- !
gressive game, and kept the ball in
the territory of the Rifles during j
the greater part of the first half. In
the second half the Rifles played a
good, scientific game, and developed
better team work. Shand succeeded
in getting the ball between the goal
posts, and almost immediately
afterward Lvdon secured a second
goal for the Rifles. The game was
a lively one throughout, and the
head-work and dribbling of the
men were much admired.
