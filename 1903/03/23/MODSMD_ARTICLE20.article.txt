# INDEPENDENTS WIN.
## Manager Ireland Changes His Lineup and Defeats a Shattered Team. 
### 
With a team in which many of
the old men were missing, Ireland
snatched a victory from the Var
sity after eleven innings of closely
played baseball. The gameseemed
to be in the hands of the Varsity
throughout, as they scored two
runs in the third and maintained
their lead until the Independents
tied the score in the eighth.
Neither side was able to gain
another tally until the last of the
eleventh, when Ireland hit the ball
over second and scored Stultz from
that base. Moth Perrine and Roose
velt held the heavy hitters down,
the Varsity making seven bits

while the Independents got only
six.
As a team the Varsity made but
few errors, but in base-running
shewed lamentable weakness. The
men are fast enough on their feet
and willing to take a chance, but
throughout Saturday's game used
their heads to poor advantage and
lost several runs by stupid at
tempts. Of the three freshmen in
the Varsity line-up, Wirt in right
field plnyed an errorless game and
secured a single and a three-base
hit at the bat. Williams fell off a
little at Bhort, although the chances
that he failed to get were hard
ones. At third, Dudley,who played
in Hall's place, had only one
chance; he showed that he is
possessed of a strong arm and can
throw to bases with accuracy.
This gives tbe Independents two
out of the three games so far
played, but should the Varsity win
Junior Day another contest will be
necessary to decide the champion
ship.
