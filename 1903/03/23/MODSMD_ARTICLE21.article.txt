# Varsity Defeats Professionals.
## 
### 
The Varsity wiped out the. two
defeats administered l>y the San
Francisco professionals by winning
last Friday's game. The score of
4 to 3 is a sufficient evidence of the
close nature of the contest, but fails
to shfxv the interest felt by all the
spectators. Tritch pitched a steady,
effective game, and to the fact that
the leagures were not. able to hit
him is due the victory of the Var
sity. The professional pitchers,
VVhalen and Iberg,proved far from
effective, being found for eight
clean hits. The game was by far
the best played and most encourag
ing contest from a Varsity stand
point that has been played on the
campus this semester.
