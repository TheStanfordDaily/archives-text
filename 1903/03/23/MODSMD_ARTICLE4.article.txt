# TEAMS ARE CHOSEN.
## Two Strong Trios Will Meet California and Washington in Debate. 
### 
Professor C. A. Duniway of the
History department announced the
decision of the judges in the final
try-outs for the selection of debat
ing teams to meet the California
and Washington State universities
as follows:
Intercollegiate team to meet Cal
ifornia will be composed of H. M.
Lewis, '04, Frank Roehr, '04, and
O. C. Spencer, 04; alternate, A. M.
Dibble, '05.
Second team to meet Washing
ton consists of J. 11. Page, '03, O. H.
Hitter, '04,and Alex.Sheriffs; '05, a
lternate, W. C. Maloy, '03.
The thirteen contestants were
divided into two squads of seven
and six speakers respectively. Both
squads debated the Monroe doc
trine question that will be dis
cussed with the California team.
All in all the debates were the
most successful that have been
heard at Stanford try-outs for some
time. The most remarkable feat
ure was the excellent preparation
of each contestant and the close
competition in which places on the
team were won. Any of the thir
teen speakers could well be sent
out to represent the University in
a debating contest.
11. M. Lewis, member of the re
cent Carnot team and of the '04
Sophomore team, was the first
speaker of the evening. He was
up to his usual form,and presented
a graceful speech against the ad
herence to the Monroe doctrine in
the strict sense outlined by the neg
ative.
J. H. Page, alternate on last
year's Intercollegiate team, fol
lowed on the negative with a strong
argument against the case of the
affirmative. His strength lay in
logic and force.
A. M. Dibble spoke second on
the affirmative. His argument, was
ingenious and full of life. Dibble
made the finals in the Carnot and
was a member of the '05 Freshman
team.
O. C. Spencer easily put forth
the strongest case for the negative.
His logic was excellent, and his
voice and general delivery the most
pleasing of any speaker of the
evening. Spencer was alternate on
the Carnot team this year and a
member of the '04 Freshman trio.
His addition to the two speakers
who are to be his colleagues is a
good one.
L. 11. Roseberry continued tlie
case for the affirmative. His speech
was full of animation, but lacked
proper organization.
M. H. Thorpe made an admir
able showing on the negative from
a rhetorical point of view. His
case, however, lacked in quantity
of argument.
Miss Annette Knowles, the last
speaker of the squad, presented the
affirmative side from a. broad basis
of view. Her delivery and clear
ness of voice were good.
Frank Koehr opened the ques
tion in the second debate. From
the standpoint of organization of
material his argument was not sur
passed by any other speaker.

Iloehr's form and ability in debat
ing are already well known from
his showing in the recent Carnot
contest.
It. O. Hadley treated the question 1
largely from a commercial and
economic standpoint. His speech
showed thought, but did not treat
all phases of the question.
Alex. Sheriffs, the only under
classman to make a regular place
on either team, earned his position
by a thoroughly interesting speech
delivered in a forceful and pleasing
manner. Sheriffs made his Fresh
man team last year.
A. S. Williams spoke for the
negative and added interest to his
argument by producing charts and
illustrating some features of the
commercial phase of the question.
O. H. Hitter, a member of this
year's Carnot team and of the
Washington team last year, was
not up to his usual standard. His
speech gave evidence of lack of
preparation, but easily secured him
his position on the Washington |
team, where he will be a great force
against the strong northern team.
W. C. Maloy closed the debate
for the negative with the most
original speech of the series. His;
effort was far in advance of his
previous debating work. His
rebuttal was extremely witty and
effective.
The affirmative rebuttal give!)
by Iloehr showed good head-work
and a clear conception of the issue.
After some twenty minutes,
Professors C. A. Duniway, S. J.
McLean, and It. M. Alden, acting!
as judges, commended the speakers
very highly and rendered their de
cision on the merits of the debaters
as announced above.
E. W. Itice, '02, acted as chair
man of the debates, and W. E.
Billings, '03, as timekeeper.

showed thought, but did not treat
all phases of the question.
Alex. Sheriffs, the only under
classman to make a regular place
on either team, earned his position
by a thoroughly interesting speech
delivered in a forceful and pleasing
manner. Sheriffs made his Fresh
man team last year.
A. S. Williams spoke for the
negative and added interest to his
argument by producing charts and
illustrating some features of the
commercial phase of the question.
O. H. Hitter, a member of this
year's Carnot team and of the
Washington team last year, was
not up to his usual standard. His
speech gave evidence of lack of
preparation, but easily secured him
his position on the Washington |
team, where he will be a great force
against the strong northern team.
W. C. Maloy closed the debate
for the negative with the most
original speech of the series. His;
effort was far in advance of his
previous debating work. His
rebuttal was extremely witty and
effective.
The affirmative rebuttal give!)
by Iloehr showed good head-work
and a clear conception of the issue.
After some twenty minutes,
Professors C. A. Duniway, S. J.
McLean, and It. M. Alden, acting!
as judges, commended the speakers
very highly and rendered their de
cision on the merits of the debaters
as announced above.
E. W. Itice, '02, acted as chair
man of the debates, and W. E.
Billings, '03, as timekeeper.
Professor C. A. Duniway of the
History department announced the
decision of the judges in the final
try-outs for the selection of debat
ing teams to meet the California
and Washington State universities
as follows:
Intercollegiate team to meet Cal
ifornia will be composed of H. M.
Lewis, '04, Frank Roehr, '04, and
O. C. Spencer, 04; alternate, A. M.
Dibble, '05.
Second team to meet Washing
ton consists of J. 11. Page, '03, O. H.
Hitter, '04,and Alex.Sheriffs; '05, a
lternate, W. C. Maloy, '03.
The thirteen contestants were
divided into two squads of seven
and six speakers respectively. Both
squads debated the Monroe doc
trine question that will be dis
cussed with the California team.
All in all the debates were the
most successful that have been
heard at Stanford try-outs for some
time. The most remarkable feat
ure was the excellent preparation
of each contestant and the close
competition in which places on the
team were won. Any of the thir
teen speakers could well be sent
out to represent the University in
a debating contest.
11. M. Lewis, member of the re
cent Carnot team and of the '04
Sophomore team, was the first
speaker of the evening. He was
up to his usual form,and presented
a graceful speech against the ad
herence to the Monroe doctrine in
the strict sense outlined by the neg
ative.
J. H. Page, alternate on last
year's Intercollegiate team, fol
lowed on the negative with a strong
argument against the case of the
affirmative. His strength lay in
logic and force.
A. M. Dibble spoke second on
the affirmative. His argument, was
ingenious and full of life. Dibble
made the finals in the Carnot and
was a member of the '05 Freshman
team.
O. C. Spencer easily put forth
the strongest case for the negative.
His logic was excellent, and his
voice and general delivery the most
pleasing of any speaker of the
evening. Spencer was alternate on
the Carnot team this year and a
member of the '04 Freshman trio.
His addition to the two speakers
who are to be his colleagues is a
good one.
L. 11. Roseberry continued tlie
case for the affirmative. His speech
was full of animation, but lacked
proper organization.
M. H. Thorpe made an admir
able showing on the negative from
a rhetorical point of view. His
case, however, lacked in quantity
of argument.
Miss Annette Knowles, the last
speaker of the squad, presented the
affirmative side from a. broad basis
of view. Her delivery and clear
ness of voice were good.
Frank Koehr opened the ques
tion in the second debate. From
the standpoint of organization of
material his argument was not sur
passed by any other speaker.

Iloehr's form and ability in debat
ing are already well known from
his showing in the recent Carnot
contest.
It. O. Hadley treated the question 1
largely from a commercial and
economic standpoint. His speech
showed thought, but did not treat
all phases of the question.
Alex. Sheriffs, the only under
classman to make a regular place
on either team, earned his position
by a thoroughly interesting speech
delivered in a forceful and pleasing
manner. Sheriffs made his Fresh
man team last year.
A. S. Williams spoke for the
negative and added interest to his
argument by producing charts and
illustrating some features of the
commercial phase of the question.
O. H. Hitter, a member of this
year's Carnot team and of the
Washington team last year, was
not up to his usual standard. His
speech gave evidence of lack of
preparation, but easily secured him
his position on the Washington |
team, where he will be a great force
against the strong northern team.
