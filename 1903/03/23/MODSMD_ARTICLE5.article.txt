The Orchestra concert Friday
night was a revelation to those who
had not heard the Orchestra since
the "Antigone" last year. The
Orchestra plays better this year
than it ever has. The parts are
better balanced than heretofore
and, had careful training under
the direction of Organist Scott
Brook.
Of the orchestral numbers, the
"Antigone" selections were all well
received and the "Bacchus" chorus
was especially good. Verdi's, "Er
nani" and the "Feastof Lanterns"
were perhaps the most popular.
Miss Dorothy Goodsell gave
thorough satisfaction in her rendi
tion of "11 Ba'ccio," by L. Arditi,
and "Summer" by Chaminade. For
encores Miss (Joodsell sang "At
Parting" by Clayton Johns,
"Mighty L ik'a Rose" by Nevin,
mid by request Nevin's "Rosary."
11. 11. Barnhart was in splendid
voice and did full justice to his
solos. One of the best of these was
"The Bedouin Love Song" sung as
an encore, though "The Banks of
Lock Lomond" in ballad style was
a delightful number.
