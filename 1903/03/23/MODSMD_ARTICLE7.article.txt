# CAST OF FARCE.
## Juniors Will Present "In the Clutches of the Baron" Thursday Evening. 
### 
"In the Clutches of the Baron,"
the farce written by C. J). Mc-
Comish, which is to be presented
by the Junior class in Assembly
Hall Thursday evening, March
26tli, differs from Junior Farces of
the I fist few years in that while the
action takes place on the campus
yet the events are not directly
those of college life. The whole
plot is woven around the unex
pected arrival of two Geiman
noblemen, childhood friends of
Mrs. Garland, the widow, who come
to pay a quiet visit under a strict
incognito. They are followed by
Bill Swipes, who, in an endeavor
to capture "de swag," encounlers
the slow-going McStevens and
mixes things hopelessly. Uncle
Web appears on the scene in time
to thwart plots, and Evelyn and
Harry are the ones to whose ad
vantage everything results. The
rehearsals prove that every mem
ber of the cast will handle his part
well.
Ihe cast has been thoroughly
drilled by Mr. Paul Gerson of San
Francisco, into whose hands entire
charge of the matter was put.
Costumes and proper stage setting
will be procured in the city.
