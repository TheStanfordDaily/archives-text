# SENIOR FARCE SELECTED.
## Plot of Clever Play by Renaud, '03, and Young, '04, Turns on Recovery of Stanford Axe. 
### 
The Senior Farce committee
reached a final decision this after
noon, selecting as the best of the
manuscripts handed in that of
Ralph E. Renaud, '03, and Walde-
Young, '04. As yet the farce
selected is nameless, the original
title given by the co-authors not
being satisfactory to the Senior
committee. Members of the com
mittee were enthusiastic over the
clever production, unanimously
proclaiming it one of the best
written, most catchy and carefully
developed plays that has been
written by Stanford men within
the last four years.
The plot turns about the recovery
of .the Stanford axe. There are
three acts, the scenes of which are
laid in Encina Hall during an En
cina reception, at the Kappa Zeta
house in Berkeley at a Kappa Zeta
smoker, and on the quad, where
a big jolly-up over the return of
the axe is being celebrated. The
plot develops around these scenes
in a thrilling manner. At the En
cina reception in the first act, a
Stanford freshman overhears a
conversation between two Berkeley
men, guests of the occasion, in
which one carelessly reveals the
place of concealment of the axe in
the Kappa Zeta house. The fresh
man takes into his confidence the
two Stanford seniors who are in
strumental in the final recovery of
the stolen emblem, and together
they devise a scheme to bring back
the axe from Berkeley.
The execution of this plan is ful
filled in the second act. The three
Stanford men* while at a smoker
in the Kappa Zeta house, carry out
their plan. The freshman, owing
to noisy demonstrations, is phys
ically punished by his Berkeley
hosts, who in turn are overcome by
the seeming discovery that they
have killed h*hn. While bewailing
the misfortune their precipitancy
has led them into, they leave the
room to the man feigning death
and his grieving friends, who im
prove this opportunity to conceal
the axe. The cliifjax takes place
when the Berkeley < men discover
that they have been duped and the
axe is lost.
The final act is devoted to a jol
lification on the quad, and several
events incident to an attempt of the
Berkeley custodian to bring the
axe again to his college. He is
discovered, however, and surrenders
the trophy to the Stanford crowd
for the final scene of the play.
The humor is furnished by a
freshman who writes verses for the
Sequoia and is pursued by an aged
but persevering "co-ed." Professor
Flunkerwell and two women of
unusual qualities and interesting
characteristics are equally impor
tant in their contributions to the
humorous situations.
The farce is one of unusual liter
ary merit. It is essentially an
"acting" farce, and the work of the
actors is retarded by no long
speeches or heavy dialogue which
so often lack spice and wit.
Although the farce abounds in
"knocks," the authors have been

careful to avoid ill-natured and
cutting personalities.
There are eleven characters of im
portance in the cast, but the selec
tion of parts has not yet been
made.
The musical features have been
given much attention by the
authors. Besides an opening
chorus for each act the farce is
replete with new songs written by
graduates as well as undergradu
ates. The farce committee, con
sisting of Miss Sue Bird, chairman,
Miss Anita Perrin, Roy J. Keith,
and C. W. Thomas, Jr., announced
that no pains would be spared to
make the performance a success,an
entire set of new scenery being pro
vided for.
Both Renaud and Young have
been prominent in literary work.
Renaud edited the 1903 Quad, the
Chaparral, and has been an ex
tensive contributor to the Sequoia,
on which lie is an associate, while
Young is at present editor of the
Sequoia, and has been on the staffs
of the Daily Palo Alto and Chap
arral. He took important parts in
last year's Junior Farce and Senior
Farce and is an important char
acter in"In the Clutches of the
Baron " to be presented Thursday
night.
