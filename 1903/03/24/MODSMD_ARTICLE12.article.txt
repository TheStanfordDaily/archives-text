The University Orchestra has a
deficit on its hands because once
again the student body failed to
take advantage of an opportunity
to give recognition to one of its
most praisworthy organizations.
The concert was one worthy of
an older and more experienced
organization. The members of the
Orchestra have worked hard, have
given time and energy to the per
fecting of an undergraduate activ
ity. When professional singers
give concerts at Stanford we are
wont to apologetically point out
the fact that there are so many
concerts which the students feel in
duty bound to support that out
side artists are apt to fare badly.
But we do not patronize our own
organizations. This semester the
Band dance, the Girls' Glee Club
concert, and the Orchestra concert
did not receive the encouragement
which they deserved.
