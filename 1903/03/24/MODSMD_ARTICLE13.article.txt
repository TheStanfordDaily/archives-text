The bill which was introduced
in the State Legislature February
16th, enabling Mrs. Stanford to
surrender her powers as surviving
Founder of Stanford University,
after having passed both branches
of the Legislature, was signed
by the Governor. By the terms
of the act under which the
University was founded and the
Founding Grant, the powers and
duties of control and management
of the University were vested in
the Founders and the Survivor, and
it was provided that the functions
of the trustees were to begin upon
the death of both Founders. The
purpose of the new act was to pro
vide for the immediate succession
of the Hoard of Trustees to all their
powers and duties upon the resig
nation of Mrs. Stanford.
