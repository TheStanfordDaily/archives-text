The Portland team arrived on
the campus this morning but left
immediately after noon for San
Francisco, the heavy rain having
put the baseball diamond into
such shape that no game could be
played. This was the second time
that a game scheduled with Port
land had to be called off on ac
count of bad weather. The team
commences its league games Thurs
day and can therefore play none
with Stanford this season.
