# "Sequoia" Out Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The next Sequoia, out tomorrow,
has a plentiful assortment of good
stories. H. C. Brown, '04, and
It. J. Sterrett, '02, collaborate on a
strong story of an early Franciscan
monk, entitled "Unatoned." It. E.
Renaud, '03, writes, in "Far from
the Sea," a three-page poem of
beauty and power. Irene A.
Wright, '04, writes another of "The
Stanford Year" stories. The name
of Anita B. Perrin, '03, appears for
the first time this year among the
contributors, and Blanche L. How
ard, '03, pictures a side of child life
quite different from the others that
have been a feature of this year's
Sequoia. The Sketch Book has
three "-studies in style" of unusual
merit by Carl B. Wintler,'o4, 11. F.
Coolidge, '03, and Miss Eva Thomp
son, '05.
