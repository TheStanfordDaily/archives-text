# Saturday's Track Trials.
## 
### 
A close day and loose track com
bined to make the trials of last
Saturday slow. The unsettled
state of the weather also tend
ed to make the men a little slow.
Yet there were some good perform
ances. Holman's half in 2:06, and
Dunn's quarter in 52 3-5, and
Smith's in 53 2-5, were good un
der any conditions. Ilawley did
the two-twenty in 23 1-5, and
sprinted a very fast hundred but
no time was taken. Weller made
a jump of 21 feet 3 1-2 inches.
The other trials were: Thomson,
'05, made2:l4 in the half; Sprague,
'04, ran two miles in 11:03; Lovell,
'06, did the mile in 5:03 2-5; Hay
ward's half was in 2:15; and Nara
more ran the high hurdles in
17 1-5.
