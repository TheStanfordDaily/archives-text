# New Senior Society at Yale.

### 
Announcement was made Friday
at New Haven of the formation of
a new senior class organization at
Yale. The new society, which will
he known as the Elihu Cluh, has
the official approval of the univer
sity authorities. It is to be non
secret and its relation to the pres
ent senior societies is interesting
from the fact that its active mem
bership will he restricted to those
students who are not members of
any other senior society.
