# DR. JORDAN AT BERKELEY.
## Gives Address at Forty-Third Anniversary of University of California. 
### 
The regular charter day celebra
tion of the University of California
was held yesterday morning at
Berkeley to commemorate the forty
third anniversary of the founding
of the university. Governor Par
dee, President Wheeler, and Dr.
Jordan were the speakers. l)r.
Jordan spoke on "University Ten
dencies," and among other things
said: "There are some things that
our universities need to do. We
need to take better care of our stu
dents. We have a great many
more than we ought to take; yet
we can take care of the others bet
ter if we drop off half and then
look after the others with individ
ual and personal solicitation. The
very best thing in the institution is
personal acquaintance with the
educators, in all instances there
is an element of personality that is
not like any other institution. It
was my good fortune to have known
two great men before I got a college
education. One was Louis Agassiz
and the other, Russell Lowell. The
books I studied, or a groat number
of them, I would be glad to forget
rather than to forget my personal
contact with these two men. There
are many such men gathered about
now â€”men of worth whom it is
worth while to know personally,
and besides these dozen or two
there are many more far enough
along to help you if you will be
come acquainted with them.
'I discovered an astonishing
thing the other day. That after
half a dozen successful strikes the
bricklayers were earning more on
an average than professors. Profes
sors have spent four years in some
good college, or perhaps three in
Germany in some instances, and
have done good work, but are earn
ing less money than the bricklay
ers are, and the bricklayers do not
have to work so long or go through
any special previous training, and
it is easier for them to go to a new
place than it is for the college man
who has once been dropped from a
position which he has held. Un
less we are willing to pay college
professors more than bricklayers,
we will have some of- our men
practicing bricklaying, applying
their leisure time after the day's
work is over to the study of Socrates
and Browning and others, and it is
going to turn our men away from
a college career unless they can do
better. As it is, a great many of
our college men could not possibly
live in any other profession.
"We should take more care of
our students; we should see that
they do their work thoroughly and
go away fitted to take the place of
other men who simply idle away
their time. The professors and the
students should come into closer
relations with each other. The
students should be known by name
to somebody, and not merely by
name, but by character, that there
may be sotno one in the faculty
who will vouch for every individual
man and who knows what he is
and what there is to be said about
hi in which is good. This idea
would give us better trained men."
