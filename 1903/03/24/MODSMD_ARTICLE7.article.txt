# May Give Two Performances.
## 
### 
The executive committee of the
English Club has been asked to
give two performances of the
"Knight of the Burning Pestle"
while in Berkeley Saturday. A
telegram to that effect was received
today, the tickets for the Saturday
evening performance having been
disposed of this morning a few
hours after being put on sale. The
added performance, if given, will
be given Saturday afternoon.
