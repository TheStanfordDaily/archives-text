# McCAUGHERN BREAKS DOWN.
## Yesterday, Varsity Track Captain Strains a Tendon While Running a Trial. 
### 
J. C. McCaughern, '03, captain
of the Varsity track team, while
running a trial yesterday morning
strained a tendon in his left leg.
He will in all probability be unable
to take part in track athletics for
the of the season.
This accident greatly lessens the
chances of the Cardinal in the
State University meet. McCaug
hern was depended upon to take
a first place in the two-twenty, and
probably a place in the hundred.
The enforced withdrawal of the
captain and Turpin, leaves the
brunt of the sprinting on Hawley,
Hamilton, and Lyons.
The injury is what is known
among athletes as a "break down,"
and is like the injury which kept
McCaughern from doing anything
in the Intercollegiate field-day two
years ago.
The track team has suffered con
siderably the last two weeks. Tur
pin and McCaughern are gone in
the hundred. Swinerton, one of
the most promising half-milers, left
for Annapolis. It is understood
that there is a possibility of Hol
man, the distance man, whom the
captain has depended upon for
points, leaving before the field-day.
