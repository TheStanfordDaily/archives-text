Harvard and Yale, after more
than a year of negotiations, have
signed an athletic agreement to ex
tend over the space of two years.
The new departure in the agree
ment provides for an arbitration
committee, and for the election of
the men eligible for a team, by the
captain of the team, together with
a committee of graduates. In the
matter of eligibility of students
from other colleges the agreement
is less strict than the California-
Stanford rule, as it required a year
of local residence for men coming
from othfer coileges only in case
they have played in intercollegiate
matches. Unsatisfactory scholar
ship is seemingly penalized more
severely than at Stanford, as a
man "dropped" to a lower class or
out of college is not "eligible" till
he has done a year of satisfactory
work â€”instead of a semester, or
semester and a half, as is the rule

here. The severity or laxity of
such a rule, however, depends, of
course, on the standard of scholar
ship set up by the instructors. The
Harvard-Yale agreement also pe
nalizes students on probation, as is
the case at Stanford, though not
the case at the University of Cali
fornia. A wise provision of the
agreement makes ineligible any
man receiving remuneration for
athletic expenses, or for coach
ing from any organization save his
college, or a " permanent amateur
association of which he was at the
time a regular member." This
would forestall any such difficulties
as came from the Smith case, and
rule out the "Sunday" and "sum
mer" ball players. In general the
agreement is like that existing be
tween Stanford and the University
of California.
