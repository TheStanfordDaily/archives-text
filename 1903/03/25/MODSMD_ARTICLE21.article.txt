# SYSTEM OF STUDENT GUIDES.
## Proper Information Will Hereafter Be Given Visitors Who Come to See the University. 
### 
The President's office is making
arrangements for a system of stu
dent guides about the University.
Every year the number of visitors
who come to the University to
look over the buildings and grounds
has been increasing, and this year
it lias been unusually large. No
attempt has been made heretofore
to show these people about and to
give them correct information about
the things that interest them. They
have been left entirely in the
hands of the busmen. The services
of a number of students who are
well fitted to give information and
who will be able to devote some
time to acting as guides will be
enlisted. A great many tourists
come from San Francisco and the
â€¢South on the morning trains, and
students will meet them upon their
arrival at the quad and conduct
them about. More or less dis
tinguished visitors often call at
the President's or Registrar's office,
and in future these will be properly
cared for. All the details of the
plan have not yet been worked out,
but it will probably be in operation
within a week.
