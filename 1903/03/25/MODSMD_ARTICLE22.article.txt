At the meeting of the Spanish
Club Saturday night, Prof. Carlos
Bransby of theUni versity of Califor
nia spoke on "The Poets of Colom
bia." He mentioned the fact that
in Colombia liferature has always
occupied an important position,â€”
that there have been many import
ant men of letters in Colombia
who have received recognition in
Spain for their work. Juan Valera,
Spain's foremost literary critic of
the present day, gives the Colom
bian credit for being more truly
Spanish than their ..peninsular
cousins. Professor Bransby touched
upon the following poets: Rafael
Nunez, Jose Maria Garrido, Miguel
Antonio Caro, Julio Arcboleda,
Herman Gutierres de Pineres,
