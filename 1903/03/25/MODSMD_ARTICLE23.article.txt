# Yale Offers Electives.
## 
### 
The policy of throwing open elec
tive courses to all classes, inaugur
ated at Yale by President Hadley,
has been followed to a greater extent
this year than in former years. A
slight latitude of choice is open to
freshmen, while sophomores are
given a range of fifteen courses
from which they may select five,
The two upper classes pursue work
entirely elective to such an extent
that the senior year, under certain
conditions, may be counted as one
year in the medical, law, or theo
logical course. This change of sys
tem is due almost entirely to the
work of President Hadley, the

conditions of two years ago being
such that all freshman work was
required.
