especially for the Junior Farce
by artists of the Columbia The
ater, was putin place this after
noon. The scene represents the
drawing-room of a house on the
Row. The committee has planned
to make the setting one of the best

A feature of the setting will be
an Indian corner with bows and
arrows, skins and rugs. The walls
will be decorated with painting
and etchings. In fact everything
will be used to make the scene
