In spile of the inclement weather
a fair audience heard Herr Riotte
in the chapel last' evening. The
program was versatile in the ex
treme, extending over dramatics,
lyric and epic poetry, in each of
which the reader proved himself a
master. One of the most pleasing
characteristics of Herr Riotte's
reading was his freedom from man
nerisms, and his perfect composure,
for though most of the selections
called for strong emotion, he never
once lost control of his voice or
action. The best numbers were
Goethe's "Der Erlkonig," Schli
ler's "Der Tacuher," the scene
from Schiller's"NVilhelm Tell,"and
that from Lessing's "Nathan der
Weise." In addition to the num
ders announced, Herr Riotte read
with much dramatic force I)r.
Julius Goebel's fine poem "Attila's
God."
