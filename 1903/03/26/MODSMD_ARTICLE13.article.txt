This will be the last issue of the
Daily Palo Alto before the first
of the season's Intercollegiate base
ball games. It is unnecessary to
say editorially what is custom
arily said before Intercollegiate
meets. It is not necessary to say
that we expect the team lo do its
best for Stanford, that it has the
backing of the student body, that
the student body should attend and
show the team that it is backed.
The baseball men have drilled and
to the man have answered the call
of captain and coach, and through
misfortune have worked on, deter
mined to make the best of what
they had. There has been on the
diamond a unity of spirit, a spirit
of hard work, that is admirable.
The' men deserve to win. The
game played by the Varsity on the
State University campus last year
showed that it had the fight in it
to hold out against odds. This
year the odds are not so great, and
the men have a right to expect to
win. The Stanford men who will
sit on the bleachers will cheer the
work of the Varsity and rejoice
in their good plays. There is
greater opportunity for objection
able rooting at a baseball game
than at the games of any other
sport. In some of the Intercolle
giate matches in the past a lack of
the courtesy which should mark a
contest between college teams, at
times lias been noticed. The East

ern college man finds these things
very little to his liking. It is up
to the student bodies of the two
universities to keep these tenden
cies down and develop a thorough
ly wholesome intercollegiate cour
tesy.
