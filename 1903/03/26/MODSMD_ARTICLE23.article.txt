# INTERCOLLEGIATE BASEBALL.
## Stanford Will Meet California for the First Game on Berkeley Campus, April 4th. 
### 
Before college opens at the close
of the Easter recess the first Inter
collegiate baseball game will have
been played. The afternoon of
April 4th the two college nines will
meet on the diamond at Berkeley.
Any forecast of the probable out
come of the game, written at the
present time, has but little absolute
fact upon which to be based. The
early form of the respective teams
and a comparison of e:uly scores
are interesting but hardly import
ant in forcasting the standing of
the teams at the end of the season.
At the present time there is every
prospect of a close contest the out
come of which should be uncertain
until the end of the ninth inning
Both Stanford and California have
evinced an ability to play first
class baseball —Stanford in her
series with the San Francisco pro
fessionals; California in her series
with Santa Clara college. On the
other hand both teams have shown
that at periods they play baseball
comparable only to the crude at
tempts of a grammar school nine.
Under normal conditions, however,
each team may be expected to play
fast, consistent ball.
The season at Stanford has un
dergone several distinct periods.
When Coach Swindells called his
nine together for the first practice
there was a wealth of experienced
material from which to develop a
fast fielding team. At the bat last
season's record showed Stanford to
be weak. At present Swindells
has produced a team which for the
last two weeks has been consistent
ly hitting the ball, while through a
series of unforseeable accidents he
has been forced to shift the infield
line up on the eve of the Intercol
legiate contest.
As a whole the team is batting
strongly. It is, of course, a problem
whether or not the Cardinal players
will bo able to hit Overall safely.
He is a wonderful pitcher, and
should he be in good condition, may
be expected to hold the number of
safe hits down to a small margin.
In the outfield Stanford has noth
ing to fear: Captain Brown, Low
enthal, find Freshman Wirt seem
to be the most logical candidates
for the three positions and all three

of the men are careful and sure
outfielders.
Paul Parker, for two years
Varsity pitcher, seems to be the
the most likely to pitch the first
game. Although not a "strike-out"
pitcher, Parker has excellent con
trol, good speed, a fair assortment
of curves, and uses his head to the
best possible advantage. He
pilches better baseball when two
men areonbases and no one out than
when the game is well in hand.
The other men, Tritch, Sales,
and Roosevelt, are hard to differ
entiate. Each man possesses some
of the qualities which make a
Varsity pitcher, but no one of them
is sufficiently versatile to endanger
Parker's position.
As a whole the team is strong in
base running, the men being fast
on their feet and using excellent
judgment. The infield presents
the weakest feature of the team.
Individually the players are strong,
and with two or three weeks prac
tice should play well together; but
at present the combination on
second, short, and third in a pinch
is not sure to work smoothly. The
complete shake-up of the infield
necessitated by the loss of Craw
ford has been of too recent date to
allow the men sufficient practice to
be working strongly together.
By the 4th of April, however,
the team should be rounded into
good shape. Although the team
has not been chosen, the nine
men who will line up against the
Independents Friday will in all
probability play in the first Inter
collegiate game. Parker will be in
the box. He has been Varsity
pitcher for two seasons, pitching a
wonderful game on the Berkeley
campus last year. McGilvray will
be behind the bat for second
season. His greatest weakness is
a disposition to drop the ball
his arm is strong and his throws
to bases quick and accurate; Cow
den on first is a veieran. He cap
tained the Varsity nine last season
from second base, but showed no
falling off in form when he was
switched to first this season. Copp
at second made the Varsity last
year for the first time. He was
recently changed from his old
place at third to second base, and
Bruce Ball was sent to third. Ball
is a new man on the bases at Stan

ford. He hiis heretofore played in
the outfield, and been behind the
bat. lie caught for the '01 Var
sity and was absent from college
last year. There are two freshmen
who will probably play: Williams
at shortstop, and Wirt in right
Held. Williams played with Mult
nomah Athletic Club, and has
developed into a good man during
the last two months. Wirt played
on the Santa Rosa team before
coming to college. He is strong at
the bat and has shown up well in
the field. Captain Brown in cen
ter is a veteran. He has held
his men together well throughout
the season and is an individually
strong player. Lowenthal will
play in left-field for the third time
in an Intercollegiate series. He
covers a great deal of territory and
stands well up in the batting
averages. The other men who
figure most prominently in the
race for positions are Knight, who
played right-field on last year's
Varsity; Trowbridge, who captained
the Sophomore team this year; and
Dudley, a freshman who is trying
for an infield position.
Coach Swindells refused to ex
press a positive opinion as to the
outcome of the first game. He re
gards the outlook as encouraging
and thinks the Cardinal will stand
a good chance against California.
"The men are playing good base
ball," he said, "and if they can hit
Overall we should win. I don't
think Parker will be hit much, and
the men behind him will back him
up. We will make a hard fight
and if luck does not go the other
way we should win."

for the three positions and all three

of the men are careful and sure
outfielders.
Paul Parker, for two years
Varsity pitcher, seems to be the
the most likely to pitch the first
game. Although not a "strike-out"
pitcher, Parker has excellent con
trol, good speed, a fair assortment
of curves, and uses his head to the
best possible advantage. He
pilches better baseball when two
men areonbases and no one out than
when the game is well in hand.
The other men, Tritch, Sales,
and Roosevelt, are hard to differ
entiate. Each man possesses some
of the qualities which make a
Varsity pitcher, but no one of them
is sufficiently versatile to endanger
Parker's position.
As a whole the team is strong in
base running, the men being fast
on their feet and using excellent
judgment. The infield presents
the weakest feature of the team.
Individually the players are strong,
and with two or three weeks prac
tice should play well together; but
at present the combination on
second, short, and third in a pinch
is not sure to work smoothly. The
complete shake-up of the infield
necessitated by the loss of Craw
ford has been of too recent date to
allow the men sufficient practice to
be working strongly together.
By the 4th of April, however,
the team should be rounded into
good shape. Although the team
has not been chosen, the nine
men who will line up against the
Independents Friday will in all
probability play in the first Inter
collegiate game. Parker will be in
the box. He has been Varsity
pitcher for two seasons, pitching a
wonderful game on the Berkeley
campus last year. McGilvray will
be behind the bat for second
season. His greatest weakness is
a disposition to drop the ball
his arm is strong and his throws
to bases quick and accurate; Cow
den on first is a veieran. He cap
tained the Varsity nine last season
from second base, but showed no
falling off in form when he was
switched to first this season. Copp
at second made the Varsity last
year for the first time. He was
recently changed from his old
place at third to second base, and
Bruce Ball was sent to third. Ball
is a new man on the bases at Stan

ford. He hiis heretofore played in
the outfield, and been behind the
bat. lie caught for the '01 Var
sity and was absent from college
last year. There are two freshmen
who will probably play: Williams
at shortstop, and Wirt in right
Held. Williams played with Mult
nomah Athletic Club, and has
developed into a good man during
the last two months. Wirt played
on the Santa Rosa team before
coming to college. He is strong at
the bat and has shown up well in
the field. Captain Brown in cen
ter is a veteran. He has held
his men together well throughout
the season and is an individually
strong player. Lowenthal will
play in left-field for the third time
in an Intercollegiate series. He
covers a great deal of territory and
stands well up in the batting
averages. The other men who
figure most prominently in the
race for positions are Knight, who
played right-field on last year's
Varsity; Trowbridge, who captained
the Sophomore team this year; and
Dudley, a freshman who is trying
for an infield position.
Coach Swindells refused to ex
press a positive opinion as to the
outcome of the first game. He re
gards the outlook as encouraging
and thinks the Cardinal will stand
a good chance against California.
"The men are playing good base
ball," he said, "and if they can hit
Overall we should win. I don't
think Parker will be hit much, and
the men behind him will back him
up. We will make a hard fight
and if luck does not go the other
way we should win."
Before college opens at the close
of the Easter recess the first Inter
collegiate baseball game will have
been played. The afternoon of
April 4th the two college nines will
meet on the diamond at Berkeley.
Any forecast of the probable out
come of the game, written at the
present time, has but little absolute
fact upon which to be based. The
early form of the respective teams
and a comparison of e:uly scores
are interesting but hardly import
ant in forcasting the standing of
the teams at the end of the season.
At the present time there is every
prospect of a close contest the out
come of which should be uncertain
until the end of the ninth inning
Both Stanford and California have
evinced an ability to play first
class baseball —Stanford in her
series with the San Francisco pro
fessionals; California in her series
with Santa Clara college. On the
other hand both teams have shown
that at periods they play baseball
comparable only to the crude at
tempts of a grammar school nine.
Under normal conditions, however,
each team may be expected to play
fast, consistent ball.
The season at Stanford has un
dergone several distinct periods.
When Coach Swindells called his
nine together for the first practice
there was a wealth of experienced
material from which to develop a
fast fielding team. At the bat last
season's record showed Stanford to
be weak. At present Swindells
has produced a team which for the
last two weeks has been consistent
ly hitting the ball, while through a
series of unforseeable accidents he
has been forced to shift the infield
line up on the eve of the Intercol
legiate contest.
As a whole the team is batting
strongly. It is, of course, a problem
whether or not the Cardinal players
will bo able to hit Overall safely.
He is a wonderful pitcher, and
should he be in good condition, may
be expected to hold the number of
safe hits down to a small margin.
In the outfield Stanford has noth
ing to fear: Captain Brown, Low
enthal, find Freshman Wirt seem
to be the most logical candidates
for the three positions and all three

of the men are careful and sure
outfielders.
