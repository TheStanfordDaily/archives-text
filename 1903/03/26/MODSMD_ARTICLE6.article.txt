# JUNIOR DAY EVENTS.
## Interclass Field-Day in Morning.—Baseball in Afternoon.—Prom in Evening. A University Holiday. 
### 
Classes Meet on Oval.
The track has dried out and with
the aid of roller and rake will be
putin condition for the Interclass
field-day. The meet, which ranks
next to the Intercollegiate in inter
est, will take place on the oval to
morrow at ten. The state of the
track will make good records almost
impossible, yet the number of good
men entered in each event will
make the meet one of the most
hotly contested for several years.
There will be a relay of a half-mile,
between men from the classes, each
man running two hundred and
twenty yards. The relay ought to
be very fast, as each class has a
good representation of two-twenty
men. McCaughern's absence from
the sprints will cut down the Senior
class chances,but with Hawley and
Lyons left '03 will carry off a good
bunch of points. The old-time
rivals, Smith, '03, and Dunn, '04,
will meet again, so that the quarter
is sure to be -fast. Holman, '04,
and Thomson, '03, in the half will
fight hard for first. There is not
an event that will go to any but
good men.

Classes Meet on Oval.
The track has dried out and with
the aid of roller and rake will be
putin condition for the Interclass
field-day. The meet, which ranks
next to the Intercollegiate in inter
est, will take place on the oval to
morrow at ten. The state of the
track will make good records almost
impossible, yet the number of good
men entered in each event will
make the meet one of the most
hotly contested for several years.
There will be a relay of a half-mile,
between men from the classes, each
man running two hundred and
twenty yards. The relay ought to
be very fast, as each class has a
good representation of two-twenty
men. McCaughern's absence from
the sprints will cut down the Senior
class chances,but with Hawley and
Lyons left '03 will carry off a good
bunch of points. The old-time
rivals, Smith, '03, and Dunn, '04,
will meet again, so that the quarter
is sure to be -fast. Holman, '04,
and Thomson, '03, in the half will
fight hard for first. There is not
an event that will go to any but
good men.
The officials are: Timers, Dr.
