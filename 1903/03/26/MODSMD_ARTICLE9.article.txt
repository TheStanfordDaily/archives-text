# Dr. Jordan's Eastern Trip.
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan will leave tomorrow
for the East via the Santa Fe, and
is to be absent about three weeks.
His first stop will be at Columbia,
Missouri, where he is to speak to
the students of the state university
on the subject of "College Spirit."
From there he will proceed to Chi
cago, to address the association of
college and high school teachers of
the Middle West on "American
University Tendencies." New York
is Dr. Jordan's eastern destination.
Several points of importance are to
be visited, but no definite dates
have been made for addresses.
