Although the team was defeated
in Saturdays giime, it is well to
remember with the team, that the
peries is not yet finished, and Stan
ford can win. We sent to Berkeley
the best men that we had, we sent
them after they had been coached
and trained to the hour. That
good fortune was not ours is regret
able but not discouraging. It
means that in the week that re
mains before the second contest the
Cardinal players will work with a
will. It means that the spirit
which kept the Cardinal rooters on
their feet, cheering, after the game
was lost last Saturday, will make
them back their team next Satur
day in victory or in defeat.
