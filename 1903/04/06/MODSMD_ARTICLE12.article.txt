quantities had leaked into a por

organ" of Memorial Church

matic valves have had to he re
placed by new ones which arrived
from Los Angeles this morning.
Although only'the east half of the
instrument is directly affected by
the leakage, the two parts are so
related that the whole organ is
practically out of working order.
It will be fully two weeks before
the organ is completely repaired.
It was fixed up in a temporary way
and was used at yebterday's ser
