# The 						Junior Farce.

### 
The Junior Farce, "In the
Clutches of the Baron," presented
in Assembly Ilall the evening of
March 26th, was enjoyed by the
audience and was in general a suc
cess, though the cast had to con
tend with a farce which had few
well-worked-up situations. The
local hits were numerous and well
selected. Owing to lack of suffici
ent time for the preparation the
entrances and other minor details
of the stage management were not
perfect, but little was detracted
from the play thereby.
The stage settings, which were en
tirely new, were especially artistic.
The costumes were well selected.
The farce had too much of the
melodrama and not enough of the
fun-making college farce.
Each member of the cast entered
fully into the spirit of his part, and
the acting could not have been im
proved. W. J. Stack, '03, played
the title role in a highly creditable
manner. 11. G. Barnett, '04, as
Prince K.ase von Limburger, gave
an excellent presentation of the
German noble in the United States.
Miss Claire Soule, '04, as Evelyn,
and Dudley Sales, '06, as Harry
Hilton were good. Miss Edyth
Hale, '04, played most satisfactor
ily the difficult part of Mrs.
Garland, a widow who lives
on the row. Waldemar Young,
'04, as Uncle Webb from Illinois,
brought down the house. L. 11.
Iloseberry, '03, did well in the part
of Bill Swipes, the burglar. One
of the best hits of llie evening was
McSteven, the Berkeley graduate,
played by P. B. Cunningham, '06.
The minor parts were well present
ed, that of the Mayfield French
maid taken by Miss Ruth Seadler,
'05, receiving well deserved ap
plause.
