# Junior Class Dance.
## 
### 
The Junior Prom was given in
Encina club-room Friday evening,
March 271h, the usual climax to
Junior Day. The decorations of ihe
lohhy and the club-room were Jap
anese and Chinese. The lobby was
draped with green and white bunt
ing, evergreens, and Japanese flags,
lanterns, and umbrellas, and the
club-room with Chinese flags, um
brellas, and lanterns, with red and
yellow bunting artistically strung
between the chandeliers. Fantast
ically painted Junior flags were
suspended at regular intervals. The
huge fireplace of the club-room and
the two smaller ones of the lobby
were filled with masses of green.
Couches banked with sofa pillows
filled the corners. The effect of the
whole was softened by the dimin
ished light of the incandescents in
paper lanterns.
The attendance was large, about
one hundred and forty couples
dancing. Excellent music was
furnished by Yimke's orchestra for
the program of twenty-two dances
and encores. Refreshments were
served in the rooms by waiters, a
system, new at Stanford, which was
not entirely satisfactory.
