# Junior Day Finances.
## 
### 
Junior Day was successful finan
cially. Though the expenses were
somewhat heavier than had been
anticipated, the class will neverthe
less realize about $350 from the
I'rom, the Farce, and the percent
age paid to the class from the field
day and baseball receipts. Al
though the exact expenses cannot
be ascertained at this early date,

the figures will approximate the
following:
Receipts:—Prom, $555; Farce,
•$51'2; percentage from field-day
and baseball, $35; total, $ 1102.
The expenses for the Farce aggre
gated $300 and for the Prom $450.
