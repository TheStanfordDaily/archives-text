# CALIFORNIA WINS FIRST GAME.
## Overall Proved Invincible but the Blue and Gold Found Parker After the Fourth Inning. Score Was 8 to 2. 
### 
The first game of the Intercolle
giate series was won by California
on the Berkeley campus Saturday
afternoon. Four hundred rooters
from Stanford watched their team
lose, but lose only after putting up
a plucky fight and working hard
for the runs that would not come.
Overall is responsible for the vic
tory of the Blue and Gold. After
the first inning, when he was both
ineffective and wild, the big Cali
fornian pitched an excellent game.
He allowed but two hits, gave two
bases on balls, and struck out four
men. The California t.eam as a
whole gave good support, although
Hatch, behind the bat, was wild in
throwing to bases. At the bat the
veterans of the California nine
maintained their reputation for
heavy batting; after the fourth
inning they got hits when hits
meant runs.
For three innings Parker proved
as much a puzzle as his California
rival, but the Blue and Gold play
ers began to hit safely in the
fourth, and after that at critical
junctures throughout the game.
Parker never lost his head, and
pitched a nervy, up-hill game, but
his arm had not yet recovered fully
from the wrench he gave it in last
week's practice. The work in the
field was good, although toward the
close of the game there was a com
mon disposition to become "rattled"
at critical moments.
At the bat, however, the team
showed lamentable weakness. A
season of batting practice and
ceaseless exhortations from Coach
Swindells were productive of but
little. When the Cardinal players
hit the ball it was only to drive a
long high fly into the outfield or
roll an easy ground ball to the
infield. The prophecy of Swindells
that the outcome of the game
would be almost entirely dependent
upon the ability of the Varsity to
bit the ball, was a good one.
California went to the field in
the first inning and Stanford start
ed with a rush, securing two tallies,
her first and last of the game.
Blown, the first man up, was hit
by the ball, and went to first. Ball
advanced him to second by a clever
bunt, but Brown was thrown out
at third, Cowden going to first.
Gowden stole second, went to third
on Hatch's wild throw, and secured
the first run of the game on Wil
liam's hit to right field. Williams
stole second and third, and Lowen
thal received a base on balls.
Hatch threw wild to second on
Lowenthal's steal, allowing Wil
liams to score. There were no
more runs brought in until the
fourth inning, when California
took the lead by bunching hits.
Kennedy hit over second base,
and McKeown followed his lead by
placing another in the same spot.
Heitmuller brought the Blue and
Gold rooters to their feet by driving
a double t<> deep left which sent
Kennedy home and left McKeown

on third. Overall drove a clean
double to right, Kennedy and
Heitmuller scoring; California one
run in the lead. California secured
five more tallies before the game
was ended. In the sixth Kennedy
hit the ball nearly to the fence in
left field and got to third base
before the ball was fielded in. He
scored on McKeown's long Hy. In
both the seventh and the eighth
California brought in two runs. A
two-base hit, Causley's sacrifice,
and Ball's error in the seventh,
and hits by Hendricks and Heit
muller, Overall's sacrifice, and
Hatch's single in the eighth giving
the tallies to the Blue and Gold.
Stanford could do nothing in her
half of the ninth, the final score
being California B,Stanford 2, with
California at the bat only eight
times.

The game was a great disap
pointment to the Cardinal rooters,
who had made the trip to Berkeley
expecting a victory, or at least an
extremely close score. The game
was an unquestioned victory for
California, although there is no
feeling that the loss of the first
game means the loss of the series.
A hard week of practice should do
much to increase the chances of the
