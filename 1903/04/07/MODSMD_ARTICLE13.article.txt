The Quad is essentially a Stan
ford book, representative of Stan
ford life, showing the best that
Stanford can do. Every year since
the Quad commenced publication
the members of the student body
have felt dissatisfied over the fact
that a greater number of books are
not printed. And the student body
has a right to expect larger edi
tions; no one should be turned
away who is willing to pay the
price. It lias not generally been
known that the selling price of the
book has been less than the cost of
printing, but the management
should not refuse to make the edi
tion iarge enough to satisfy the de
mands of ihe college itself.
