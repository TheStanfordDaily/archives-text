# This Month's "Alumnus."
## 
### 
The Stanford Alumnus for April
made its appearance during the
Easter vacation. The frontispiece
is a view of the Outer Quad. This
issue of the graduates' magazine it*
devoted in the main to matters of
local interest. The production of
the ''Knight of the Burning Pestle"
receives a lengthy description,
while atheletics, debating, and the
doings of former students are given
their share of attention. Editorial
comment shows that the proposed
reunion of all classes in 190.5 is
meeting with general favor.
