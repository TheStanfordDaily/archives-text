## 
### 
The English Club scored a hit in
its presentation of tiie "Knight of
the Burning Pestle" at the Univer
sity of California on tlie evening
of March 2Sth. Harmon Gymnas
ium, with a seating capacity of over
two thousand, was nearly filled and
the audience although extremely
critical, was compelled to frequent
applause throughout the three long
hours of continuous acting. The
play was admitted hy competent
judges to lie superior in literary
and dramatic interest to anything
tiiat lias ever been presented at
Berkeley. J. K. Bonnell as the
Grocer's Wife and E. C. James as
Merrythought were the favorites,
in spite of llie long interval with
out rehearsal after the original pre
sentation at Stanford the work of
the cast as a whole was even more
successful than before. \V. J.
Stack in the role of Venturewell,
and Miss Frances Kerr as Mistress
Merrythought both excelled them
selves.
The cast wap entertained by (be
various fraternities and societies of
the University of California.
