# DR. JORDAN CRITICISES YOST.
## Makes Charge That Famous Coach Has Violated Amateur Rules. 
### 
A dispatch from Chicago gives a
report of serious charges made by
President Jordan against the ineth-;
ods of Fielding 11. Yost, football
coach at Michigan and formerly j
coach at Stanford. The accusation J
was made at the annual meeting of
the North Central Association of
colleges and secondary schools at
the University of Chicago. A paper
by Prof. C. A. Waldo of Purdue
University on "The Regulation of j
Athletics in Colleges; What Next?"
was followed by a discussion in
which President Jordan said: "As
coach after Walter Camp at the
Leland Stanford Junior University,
we had two otherYale men, Cross and
Chamberlain, who were good college
sportsmen, but they did not win
games. Then we had Yost. What
I want to get at is an illustration.
A young fellow came from the
mines. He was not prepared in
bis studies to enter the University,
but he showed an interest in his
mining subjects and was admitted
as a special student. He could not
pass the entrance examinations,
and did not pass in any of his
work after admission, and so he
dropped out. Yost went to Michi
gan. This young man also went
to Michigan, and has b€en the cen
ter around which Yost has built up
a strong team. He has played
through two seasons, fifteen games
or so. It is up to us as a faculty
to see that such things do not hap
pen. All of us who have ever had
Yost or any Yost-like man about
us, are not to be counted as sinless.
The faculty has duties to perform.
It is impossible to do away with
men like Gregory, unless we do
away with other idlers."
Professor Waldo advocated the
legislation of the professional
coach off the campus.
In reply to the charge Gregory
has said: "I did not go to Stanford
with the intention of studying
mining. I. went there to prepare
myself for the law. That is my
ambition, and I have no scratch
against my class record since taking
it up here. 1 had the permission
of the authorities to make up back
work while in college, and the only
entrance examinations I took were
in English Composition and Eng
lish Literature, and I have my
credits from there to show that I
passed them."
Professor Pattengil, chairman of
the board of control, said: "Presi
dent Jordan has been hasty in his
charges. Michigan can he relied
on not to allow any men on its
athletic teams who do not fully
meet the scholarship requirements.
Gregory's work here has been
good."
