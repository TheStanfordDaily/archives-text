# Will Play Tennis.
## 
### 
Grant Smith, a member of the
California tennis team of two years
ago, with his brother, Chester
Smith, both crack men, will visit
Stanford Saturday, on the invita
tion of Harry Weihe, '03, and C.H.
Baker, '04, to play a series of
games on the new courts near
Encina. It is hoped that the court
may be completed by the end of
the week. Work has been delayed
owing to the inability of the con
tractor to get the bitumen in wet
weather. It is probable that only
one court will be constructed this
vear.
