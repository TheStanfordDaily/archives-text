### 
"Roderick Talliaferro," a story of
Maximilian's empire, the new novel
by Instructor Cook of the English
department, was brought out by
Macmillan the last week in
March, and the first copies arrived
on the campus during the holidays.
The book is illustrated by Seymour
M. Stone.
Roderick Talliaferro (pronounced
Tolliver), the hero, is the son of an
old New Orleans family. His
father and brother perish in the
war for the Confederacy, and the
young Roderick, who has won his
commission as major in his troop,
comes back at the close of the Civil
War to find that his mother has
sunk under the misfortunes of the
time; and Roderick is alone in the
old home. Everywhere about him
society is adapting itself to the rule
of the hated "Federals," but for
Talliaferro there is no surrender.
"The roof of his chateau, too, fell
in," —he burns his ancestral home
in New Orleans to keep it from
desecration, and wanders forth
with a heart unsubdued.
The story opens with the hero
standing on a busy square in Mex
ico with all the imperial society of
the Archduke Maximilian's brief
reign swarming before him. Tallia
ferro has come to the Southern
capital to offer his sword to the
French-Austrian monarch, hoping
that the latter may have war with
the Washington government and
that he may again fight the victor
ious Yankees.
An accident to a carriage in the
gay cavalcade before him gives
Roderick the opportunity to be of
service to the Mexican ladies riding
within it,and one of them has slain
him with her beautiful eyes before
the carriage rolls on again. The
awkward horseman who has caused
the accident turns out to be Sar
nette, the Vicomte d'Aurillac,
Talliaferro's friend of beautiful stu
dent days in Paris. The two cele
brate their meeting in a restaurant,
when they are joined by a young
Mexican aristocrat, Marquando,
Sarnette's friend. But Roderick's
mind returns to the beautiful vision
of the coach, and from Marquando
lie learns his fair one's name,
Felise Medina. In furtherance of
his object of entering the army
Talliaferro wishes to meet some
officers in the Emperor's service,
and Sarnett and Marquando un
dertake this for him. The two
officers approached, Colonel Lopez
of the Imperial Guards and Gener
al Joside Castro, a distant cousin
of the Felise Medina, to the aston
ishment of the trio refuse the intro
duction, Ihe reason afterwards
evolving being De Castro's insane
jealousy of Talliaferro caused by
his friend Lopez' witnessing the
morning episode of the coach.
De Castro is himself in love with
his cousin Felise, and the strife of
the two men for favor on the back
ground of the war for the tottering
empire, the greed of the clericals,
Talliaferro's inaptitude for Mexi
can ways of thought and feeling,
make up the course of the tale.

Roderick sees Felise at the
cathedral, and he and De Castro
meet upon the slips. A quarrel, a
fight, and Roderick has a taste of
French military justice. De Castro
drives him from the city, and
Roderick returns to play the
matador before all the capital the
next day. Arrested at the.close of
the carnival, he escapes and meets
Felise at the great ball given to
the imperial family, only to he
pursued by De Castro again. From
this point the war grows deadly
between the two men. In a duel
with De Castro Talliaferro fortu
nately refuses to kill I)e Castro
when the latter is at his mercy,
for De Castro's death would have
forever lost Felise to Roderick.
De Castro's hate has only grown
more venomous, and now he has
grown doubly dangerous because of
his defection to the side of the
sternly triumphant republicans.
The father of Felise, who has
hitherto favored De Castro's suit
and opposed Roderick as a stranger
and a heretic, is condemned to
death by Jaurez, the republican
leader, and only the interference of
De Castro can save him. The
price of that interference is the
hand of his cousin Felise, and
Felise, faithful to Roderick through
all the trials of the Southerner,
loving even in spite of his awful
apostasy from the religion which
to her is sacred, faithful against
her father's commands and en
treaties, is torn between filial duty,
her loathing for De Castro, and her
love for Roderick. The latter, re
turning from his distant campaign
to prop the falling fortunes of the
monarchy near the capital, learns
of the impending doom of Felise's
father and goes into the prison in
the garb of a priest that General
Mederia may come forth free. He
is putting his head into the lion's
mouth, but Roderick feels that
Felise would despise him if he let
her father perish. Before he enters
the prison, Roderick and Felise cele
brate their sad nuptials and then
Roderick goes to his fate, whatever
that mav be.

capital to offer his sword to the
French-Austrian monarch, hoping
that the latter may have war with
the Washington government and
that he may again fight the victor
ious Yankees.
An accident to a carriage in the
gay cavalcade before him gives
Roderick the opportunity to be of
service to the Mexican ladies riding
within it,and one of them has slain
him with her beautiful eyes before
the carriage rolls on again. The
awkward horseman who has caused
the accident turns out to be Sar
nette, the Vicomte d'Aurillac,
Talliaferro's friend of beautiful stu
dent days in Paris. The two cele
brate their meeting in a restaurant,
when they are joined by a young
Mexican aristocrat, Marquando,
Sarnette's friend. But Roderick's
mind returns to the beautiful vision
of the coach, and from Marquando
lie learns his fair one's name,
Felise Medina. In furtherance of
his object of entering the army
Talliaferro wishes to meet some
officers in the Emperor's service,
and Sarnett and Marquando un
dertake this for him. The two
officers approached, Colonel Lopez
of the Imperial Guards and Gener
al Joside Castro, a distant cousin
of the Felise Medina, to the aston
ishment of the trio refuse the intro
duction, Ihe reason afterwards
evolving being De Castro's insane
jealousy of Talliaferro caused by
his friend Lopez' witnessing the
morning episode of the coach.
De Castro is himself in love with
his cousin Felise, and the strife of
the two men for favor on the back
ground of the war for the tottering
empire, the greed of the clericals,
Talliaferro's inaptitude for Mexi
can ways of thought and feeling,
make up the course of the tale.

Roderick sees Felise at the
cathedral, and he and De Castro
meet upon the slips. A quarrel, a
fight, and Roderick has a taste of
French military justice. De Castro
drives him from the city, and
Roderick returns to play the
matador before all the capital the
next day. Arrested at the.close of
the carnival, he escapes and meets
Felise at the great ball given to
the imperial family, only to he
pursued by De Castro again. From
this point the war grows deadly
between the two men. In a duel
with De Castro Talliaferro fortu
nately refuses to kill I)e Castro
when the latter is at his mercy,
for De Castro's death would have
forever lost Felise to Roderick.
De Castro's hate has only grown
more venomous, and now he has
grown doubly dangerous because of
his defection to the side of the
sternly triumphant republicans.
The father of Felise, who has
hitherto favored De Castro's suit
and opposed Roderick as a stranger
and a heretic, is condemned to
death by Jaurez, the republican
leader, and only the interference of
De Castro can save him. The
price of that interference is the
hand of his cousin Felise, and
Felise, faithful to Roderick through
all the trials of the Southerner,
loving even in spite of his awful
apostasy from the religion which
to her is sacred, faithful against
her father's commands and en
treaties, is torn between filial duty,
her loathing for De Castro, and her
love for Roderick. The latter, re
turning from his distant campaign
to prop the falling fortunes of the
monarchy near the capital, learns
of the impending doom of Felise's
father and goes into the prison in
the garb of a priest that General
Mederia may come forth free. He
is putting his head into the lion's
mouth, but Roderick feels that
Felise would despise him if he let
her father perish. Before he enters
the prison, Roderick and Felise cele
brate their sad nuptials and then
Roderick goes to his fate, whatever
that mav be.
