# Roosevelt in Assembly Hall.
## 
### 
According to the itinerary of
President Roosevelt's Western trip
as given out by his secretary, there
will be a three-hour stop at the
University Tuesday, May 12th,
when President Roosevelt will
probably speak in Assembly Hall.
However, nothing definite is known
about his speaking, but as he has
promised to visit Stanford it is
very probable that he will be heard
by the students in Assembly Hall.
During the visit the President will
plant a tree on the campus.
