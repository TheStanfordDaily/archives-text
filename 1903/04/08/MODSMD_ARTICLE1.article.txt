# STANFORD MEETS BUTTE.
## The
						First of Two Games to be Played on Campus Diamond at 3:30 Tomorrow. 
### 
The second game of the Inter
collegiate baseball series, to be
played on the Stanford campus
Saturday afternoon, will be the
fourth of four consecutive games,
the first of which was played this
afternoon. Stanford met Ireland's
Independents today, and tomorrow
and Friday will play the Butte
team of the opposition league, and
Saturday -the State University.
Stanford's veteran coach, Swindells,
who will play with the Northern
team this season, will catch for
Butte in the two games scheduled
with Stanford. Tritch will pitch
for the Varsity in the first of the
two games. In all probability the
showing he makes against the pro
fessionals will determine whether
or not Tritch will be given a
chance against California next Sat
urday. Parker's arm is still
troubling him, and the soreness
may not be gone for several days.
The strain of three consecutive
games is a hard one to impose im
mediately before the final test, but
last Saturday's game showed that
heroic measures must be adopted to
develop a winning team before the
second game. The hard work and
match playing may prove the thing
which will bring victory to Stan
ford next Saturday. The admis
sion to each game will be 15 cents.
The line-up will be:
