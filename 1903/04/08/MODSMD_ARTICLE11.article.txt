# INTERCOLLEGIATE TENNIS.
## Tournaments for Selecting Players for Meet to be Attended to Immediately. 
### 
The new tennis court is not yet
completed but will probably be"in
shape for games immediately.
Whether the court is finished or
not the series of tournaments to
pick the team will have to be played
at once, as the meet with the State
University comes April 18th. Three
tournaments will have to be held
in order to decide on the three best
men outside of last year's Varsity
men, Baker and Weihe. These
men will play the Varsity a round
robin tournament, and the two first
men will represent Stanford in the
singles of the coming Intercollegiate
match, and will probably form the
double team,though not necessarily
so.
Harry Weihe, '03, and C. H.
Baker, '04. have been practising on
the Beta Theta I'i court, but the
inferiority of a dirt court will ren
der this practice of little value.
The Encina gymnasium courts are
not worth working on as the light
and the erratic bound of the ball
are sure to demoralize the best of
players; an ordinary player who
does not play in good form has an
advantage over an expert player.
The Intercollegiate tournament will
probably be held on the California
Club courts in San Francisco, as
has been done for several years
past. The matches will be com
menced at an early hour and will
be finished in time for those at
tending to get across the bay in
time for the field-day.
