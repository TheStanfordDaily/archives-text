This week Stanford will meet
teams from the State Univer
sity in baseball, banket-ball,
and tennis. The attitude of the
Stanford rooters toward their rivals
throughout the year has been de
cidedly courteous, and in general
much more courteous than in
former years. But the treatment
which some of our men received at
Berkeley last week is a disgrace to
those members of the student body
of the State University who were
guilty. In the basket-ball game
the onlookers hissed a Stanford
man for taking advantage of a foul
to try for a basket, which was per
fectly legitimate and could not
have been done otherwise, when a
few minutes previously they had
loudly applauded the act when
done by a California man. That
much was said and done on the
bleachers and side-lines with the
direct intention of rattling the
Cardinal players during the base
ball game, our batters can attest.
That such actions are not backed
up by the sober-minded of the
California student body, can easily
be concluded; but that the Califor
nian should allow it to go unchal
lenged, is hardly to be expected.
We will meet our rivals on the
campus diamond, the tennis court,
and in the gymnasium this week,
