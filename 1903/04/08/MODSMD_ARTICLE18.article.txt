### 
In response to a message of greet
ing sent by the California Cornell
Club at the recent annual meeting
in Sail Francisco, Andrew 1).
White, former president of Cornell
and at one time a special lecturer
at Stanford, writes the following
letter:
This Chalet, Alassio, Italy.
Mr. C. L. Coky, Berkeley, Cal.
My dear Sir: —I have just re
ceived the following message:
"Fifty Cornellians, including
Wheeler and Jordan, forming Cal
ifornia Cornell Club, send you their
love."
J wish to thank you for it most
heartily. No one looks with more
faith and hope to the future of
your two universities in California
than myself. They have already
accomplished a noble work; but
they are destined to exercise a still
greater influence, not only upon the
Pacific Coast, but throughout the
nation. I feel deeply interested,
not only in the curriculum of each
institution, but at the happy choice
which each has made of a president
and professors to maintain and
develop it. Still another source of
pleasure to me is the fact lhat you
have already erected, or are taking
measures for the erection of, build
ings worthy of great national seats
of learning. The old system, or
rather, want of system, which, in
this respect, has alilicted so many
of the older institutions of the
country, you have Wisely departed
from, and instead of unfit build
ings, jumbled together without
proper artistic or practical purpose,
discordant in materials and style,
you have devised plans worthy of
your great future, and with you I
feel deeply grateful to the two
noble women—one at each of the
universities —who have taken such
leading parts in this movement.
I have always retained inspiring
recollections of my stay in Califor
nia eleven years ago; one of the
happiest days in the month is that
which brings Out West to nie, with
its indications of Californian viril
ity and progress, and I congratu
late you all that you have cast in
your lot with a part of our country
to which so great a future is so
evidently assured.
Begging you to accept and to
convey to your associates my sin
cere thanks, and with every good
wish, not only to the two universi
ties, but to each and every one of
those connected with them, I re
main, Andrew I). White.
