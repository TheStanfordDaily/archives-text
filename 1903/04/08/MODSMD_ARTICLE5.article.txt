# SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Tomorrow Sees Captain Bansbach's Beginning of Preparation for Next Season. 
### 
Early in the semester it was de
termined that spring practice would
be held hy the football men. This
system of work, an innovation on
this Coast although of some years'
standing in the large universities
of the East, is one which will in all
probability prove of great benefit
when hard practice begins next
fall. The withdrawal of Magee
from the University leaves Stanford
with practically no man who can
be relied upon fur the punting. The
prime object of the spring work
will be to develop a strong and
accurate punter.
Besides this, light work will be
carried on which will develop speed
and quickness in line-men and
backs. Hy easy work in the spring
the fundamentals of the game,
which take time in the fall from
the harder grind of developing
team-work and the finer points of
the game, can be learned. Captain
Banxbach, who is the first man to
inaugurate this system at Stanford,
is enthusiastic over the idea. He
expects by a month of light work
to build a substantial foundation
for development next fall.
At present there are several posi
tions for which men must be devel
oped for the next Varsity. Stanford
lacks a punter, guards, and ends.
