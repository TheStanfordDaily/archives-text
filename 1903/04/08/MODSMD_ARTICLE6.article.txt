## Barge Secured and Rowing Practice to Begin on Lagunita Next Week. 
### 
Through the efforts of Prof. A. W.
Smith, the Stanford Boat Club has
secured a four-oared barge from the
Columbia Boat Club of Oakland at
a price of $150. This barge, to
gether with a two-oared boat,
which has been loaned by the
University of California Boating
Association for the rest of the
semester, will be brought down in
the next few days and placed on
Lagunita. Instruction in row
ing will then be given regularly
every afternoon by Professor Smith.
Lagunita is now leaking and is
sure to run dry again during the
summer. Treasurer Lathrop has
offered to make the necessary re
pairs during the summer so that
the lake may hereafter be kept
filled the entire year from the
water supply at Searsville.
Financially the club is well con
ditioned. There is a total of $500
remaining in the treasury after the
purchase of the barge. Of this
sum $250 is the gift of Mr. Charles
G. Lathrop, treasurer of the Uni
versity. Circulars are being sent
out to the alumni, and these are
meeting with fair response. J. E.
Reynolds, '96, who is working in
the interest of the club among the
New York alumni, promises to send
substantial aid.
