# NEWCOMER AND CROTHERS.
## Speakers at Assembly This Morning Talk on Publications and Founding Grant. 
### 
The faculty and students gather
ed in Assembly Hall this morning
at 11:15 to listen to Professor New
comer and Trustee Crothers, ' ( J5,
and to hold a rally preliminary to
the baseball game next Saturday.
The Girls' Glee Club sang the new
college song, " Alma Mater," and
I)r. Farrand spoke briefly on the
conduct of the rooters at Berkeley
last Saturday.
Professor Newcomer referred to
the beginnings of our college pub
lications and their present stand
ing. He had few words except in
praise for all of them. He spoke
of the difficult task of the Chapar
ral in coquetting with folly without
being foolish, lie spoke of the
standing of the Daily Palo Alto
among college publications and
praised the spirit with which it has
almost invariably been conducted,
â€”" a spirit of dignity and inde
pendence and of forbearance to
ward our rivals even in times of
excitement and intercollegiate riv
alry." Of the Sequoia he said that
its year's course furnished litera
of which we had reason for pride,
but that its chief merit lay in being
the exponent of the higher and in
tellectual life of the University.
The Alumnus, the paper which is
likely to be least known to under
graduates, was the subject of his
closing remarks: "It is this year
giving us the best history of the
University that has yet been writ
ten, and when you have passed out
side of the walls of the University
you will find in it the organ of
communication with all our best
plans and interests."
Dr. Branner, who presided in the
absence of President Jordan, intro
duced Trustee Crothers, '95, and
spoke of him as the first graduate
of the University to be elected a
member of the Board of Trustees,
Mr. Crothers received a warm wel
come from the students. He spoke
on "The Purpose and Ideals of the
Founders of the University as Re
vealed in the Grant and Their Ad
dresses."
"The great purpose of the Uni
versity is to train men who shall be
leaders of their kind. The scope of
its beneficence is not to be confin
ed to the circle of its graduates, but
through them as agents, as trustees
of the trust and advantages given
them, to help the whole people in
all the ways that uplift mankind.
"To do this most effectively the
Founders have planned that the
University, no matter how high its
standard of scholarship rises, shall
always be kept in touch with the
free public schools; that the demo
cratic spirit of its student body
shall be preserved by keeping open
all the avenues of college service to
every student, no matter of what
outward station in life; and that
this opportunity for the highest and
most thorough training for useful
ness in life must be kept open to all.
"Together with the preservation
of this democratic spirit, there must
be kept constantly in mind the
fact that the highest function of a
university, and its greatest service

to man, lies in the furtherance of
original research, the discovery of
new truth, and the freedom of
higher investigation. Since the
ultimate aim of the University is
to serve the whole people, ita best
agents for this purpose are its grad
uates, who are to regard themselves
not merely its beneficiaries in re
ceiving the education which pre
pares them for personal success in
life, but also to regard themselves
as the holders of a trust from the
University to be returned in the
service of the public."
