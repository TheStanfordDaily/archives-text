Every man and woman who
heard Professor Newcomer this
morning and who has done work
on any Stanford publication,
listened with interest to what he
had to say. His review was neces
sarily brief, yet to the student body
in general the usefulness and posi
tion of publications in a university's
life are better understood. It is
not as surprising to hear a junior
in college ask who is editor of a
college paper, as it is to hear a
freshman ask if a certain man
played on the football team. And
it has been said that not more than
seventy-live per cent of Stanford
undergraduates can name the edi
tors of the col lege publications, and
no more than twenty-live per cent
can name more than two on the
staff of each paper. It has not
been long since each of the publi
cations allowed names to stay on its
board as mere figureheads, and in
other ways cheapened the editorial
position. Since then there has
been a change on the Sequoia,
Chaparral, and Daily Palo Alto.
It takes as much sincere work and
time to make an associateehip on
the Daily Talo Alto now as it
does to make a Varsity sweater.
Professor Newcomer by his alti
tude voiced the sentiment of the
faculty in regard to the publica
tions. Members of the faculty,
who should keep in mind the dig
nity of their positions more con
sistently, have made in their
classrooms disparaging remarks
concerning the paper and maga
zines which the students themselves

are publishing, thereby prejudicing
freshmen and those who do not
know better against their own pub
lications. Fortunately the profes
sors who have done so in the past
have been few and do not represent
the sentiment of the faculty, for
the Stanford faculty is in sympathy
with the Stanford undergraduate
and is willing to help rather than
hinder student activities in work
ing for Stanford, in striving to
faithfully represent and build up
Stanford life and ideals.
