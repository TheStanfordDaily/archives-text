# Change in Tennis Rules.
## 
### 
At the annual meeting of the
United Stales National Lawn Ten
nis Association held in New York
during March the following re
visions in rules were made:
The committee to revise the rule
"let" on balls decide to make no
change in the present rule, but the
rule in regard to service was altered
so as to conform to the one now in
use in England. The rule now
reads: "The server shall serve with
both feet behind the base line, and
within the limits of the imaginary
continuation of the center-service
and side-lines. He shall place
both feet upon the ground imme
diately before serving, and shall
not take a running or walking
start. He shall deliver the service
from the right and leftcourts alter
nately, beginning from the right in
each of the service games, even
though odds be given or owed."
It was also decided to call a fault
on the server if he misses the ball
entirely in serving. The rule con
cerning the changing of sides was
amended so as to permit special
agreement between players.
