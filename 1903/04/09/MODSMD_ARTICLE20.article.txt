li. H. Kessler, ex-'O3, has dis
covered a large deposit of rare
rock near San Diego. The deposit
consists of orbicular diorite, orbi
cular gabbro, and one other variety
of similar nature, lhe diorite has
been found heretofore only on
the island of Corsica, and the
gabbro only in Norway. The rock
is of varying shades of green and
brown, and can be very highly
polished. It has great geological
and commercial value, specimens
celling at from $5 to $15 per cubic
inch for mineral collections and
museums. It is also used for in
terior furnishing of high grade.
An expert says the mine is
worth $50,000. Kessler and his
brother have tiled claims upon the
property and will work it for them
selves.
A description of the rock will he
written for th<i Geology department
either by Kessler himself or by
some of the Geology students in
the University. Specimens of the
rock have already been placed in
