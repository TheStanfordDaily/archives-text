# Lectures on the Sonata.
## 
### 
Mrs. Raymond Brown of New
York City will next week give at
the home of Prof. A. W. Smith in
Palo Alto a course of "Musical
Talks on the Sonata Form." These
talks will be upon the development
of the sonata, illustrated by the
better-known examples from Beet
hoven, Schumann, and Brahms.
Mrs. Margaret Brown is well
known in New York as the origi
nator of a new school of music,
which aims to educate listeners as
well as performers, and she has
been unusually successful in her
interpretation of the Wagnerian
"Ring" and other music of the
best class.
