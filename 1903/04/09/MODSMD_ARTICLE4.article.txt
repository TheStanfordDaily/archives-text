# YESTERDAY'S GAME.
## Stanford Wins the Series by the Score of 13 to o.—Good Ball Played. 
### 
The Varsity won the fifth game
and the series from Ireland's Inde
pendents yesterday afternoon by
the score of 13 to 0. Although the
Cardinal played an errorless game
and batted out seventeen safe hits,
the game was decidedly uninterest
ing, as the Independents played
listlessly and Perine made no at
tempt to pitch after he was found
for seven hits in the third inning.
Captain Brown began the scoring
by knocking out a home run on his
first appearance at the bat. In the
second there was a respite; in the
third Stanford had eight runs to
her credit and the game was prac
tically over. From then until the
ninth the Cardinal scored almost at
will, while Sales held the Indepen
dents down to two scattered hits.
The Freshman pitcher acquitted
himself in excellent form vesterday,
giving no bases on balls and allow
ing but two scattered singles.
Every man on the Varsity got a
safe hit, but Cowden carried off the
honors with a two-base hit, a
triple, and two singles, out of five
times at the bat.
The official score is:
STANFORD.
