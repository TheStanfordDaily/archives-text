Tomorrow will be a full day on
the campus, commencing at 9
o'clock on the Iloble courts and
ending in the evening in Assembly
Hall. The women for the first
time in several years will meet
their rivals from across the bay in
athletics, and they enter the con
test with all the enthusiasm of a
much looked forward to event.
Following this will come a base
ball game between the musical
clubs of the two universities, and at
2:30 the biggest event of the day,
the second game of the Intercol
legiate baseball will be played. In
the evening the combined clubs
will meet in Assembly Hall. It is
hardly necessary to remark upon
the attitude with which we should
receive the California representa
tives and rooters, the admonitions
of Professor Farrand in yesterday's
Assembly being much too recent to
have slipped from the minds of any
of us.
The Varsity goes into the Inter
collegiate game tomorrow undis
couraged by last week's defeat, and
the student body is not discouraged.
There are in the University fully
thirteen hundred students. Of
these, thirteen hundred should be
on the bleachers tomorrow after
noon.
