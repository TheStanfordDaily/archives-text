# NO PRIZE THIS YEAR.
## Neither Cup Nor Money is Offered to Winners of Intercollegiate Debate. 
### 
From present indications the
Stanford Intercollegiate debaters
will not have the prospect of bring
ing back with them either a trophy
cup or the usual prize of $200.
James K. Mofiit, an alumnus of
the State University, who for sev
eral years has offered the prize of
$'200, has decided to discontinue
the offer this year thinking it time
for some other interested alumnus
to come forward with a similar
offer.
For the past seven years the
prospect of winning the handsome
cup offered as a trophy by William
11. Hearst has lent interest to the
Intercollegiate debate. But as
California gained permanent pos
session of the second Hearst cup by
winning the last contest, this fea
ture will be eliminated from the
coming contest.
