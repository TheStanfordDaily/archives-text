# BUTTE DEFEATS STANFORD.
## The
						Northern Professionals Win the First Game by the Score of 3 to 2. 
### 
Stanford lost the first game of
the series to the Butte professionals
yesterday afternoon hy the score of
3 to 2. Until the fifth inning
things looked favorable for the
Varsity, as the score stood two to
nothing in favor of the Cardinal.
Stanford brought in her two tallies
hy timely hitting in the early stage
of the game, hut was unable to
repeat the performance. Roosevelt
went in the box in the fifth, and
proved to be wild. Two bases on
ball*, Wirt's error in right field,
and Swindells' hit over second
scored three runs and gave the
game to Butte. Both Tritch and
Roosevelt pitched good ball, and
except for Roosevelt's wild inning,
both proved effective. The game
was devoid of interesting features,
and the cold wind did much to take
the snap out of the playing.
