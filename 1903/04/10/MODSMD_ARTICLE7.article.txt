Since the first Intercollegiate
baseball game of the season was
played and lost on the Berkeley
campus Stanford has had one week
in which to develop a winning
team. The week has been devoted
to hard practice. There have been
three games, and the team has im
proved in consequence of the work.
The situation is practically un
changed, however, from that of last
Saturday. In the held and on the
bases Stanford plays as good ball
as California. With the added
advantage of playing on home
grounds the Varsity should be able
to more than hold its own in these
departments of the game. At the
hat the question of superiority will
again arise, and on the outcome of
this issue will depend the result of
tomorrow's game. Last Saturday
Overall proved himself to be invin
cible, but a week of hard hitting
practice may change the outcome.
The line-up for tomorrow will be
unchanged except in the pitcher's
box. Barker's arm is still troubling
him to such an extent that he has
done no pitching Vhis week and
will not be able to take his old
position tomorrow. Coach Swin
dells has not yet announced the
man who will go into the game for
the first inning. Tritch, Sales,
and Roosevelt have done good
work in the box during the last
week, so that it is hard to pick the
man who will be chosen. Each
man has his weakness. In the oc
casions that Sales forgets he is inex
perienced he pitches winning ball.
Tritch is at times prone to nervous
ness hut when cool is the most suc
cessful twirler of the corps. Roose
velt has wonderful speed and heavy
curves but lacks the control neces
sary for a Varsity man. The men
have been showing up well in the
field during the week. McGilvray
is catching in good shape. Cow
den on first is playing the best ball
of any man on the team. He is
hitting almost at will, and picks
up wild throws with gratifying
consistency. Crawford's absence
is still severely felt on the infield,
but Williams, Copp, and Ball work
together fairly well. Right field
offers the weakest spot on the team.
Captain Brown in center and Low
enthal in left are both sure in the
field and strong at the bat, but
Wirt in r'ght has not lived up to
his early promises. His batting is
erratic and he is by no means cer
tain in the field.
Coach Swindells refused to fore

cast the score in tomorrow's game
but was optimistic in his point of
view. He said: "We lost last Sat
urday because we could not hit.
We were as good in the field as
they were and ran bases better,
but we could not hit Overall. To
morrow we will be up against the
same proposition. 1 expect to see
the boys hit the ball. If they do we
will win."
Extensive preparations have
been made for the contest. Bleach
ers have been moved from the track
and erected on the third-base line
so that there will be ample accom
modations for the large crowd ex
pected from Berkeley. The game
will be called at 2:30 and admis
sion will be fifty cents. The Uni
versity Band will play.
