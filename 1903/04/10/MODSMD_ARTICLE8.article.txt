# COMBINED CONCERT.
## Musical Clubs of the two Universities Appear Before a Stanford Audience Tomorrow Night. 
### 
Tomorrow night Stanford and
the State University will unite
their musical clubs in public per
formance for the second time this
year. To quote from the Daily
Californian, "Each club when sing
ing alone will give only the choic
est of its choice selections. Good
old songs loved by the undergrad
uate will be offered, new ditties
with the ink yet damp will be
heard by the public for the first
time."
Stanford's (ilee and Mandolin
Clubs have received no end of praise
this year, the Mandolin Club
especially by its work having call
ed forth voluminous praise. The
competition between the clubs of
tbe rival colleges at tbe concert
given in Harmon gymnasium,
Berkeley, after the first game of the
Intercollegiate baseball series last
Saturday, made the concert of
striking excellence. Throughout
the numbers were given plenty of
applause.
Tomorrow night's program will
differ mainly from the one follow
ed last Saturday in that the Cali
fornia students will be given the
preference, as were Byrne and Baker
and Bush at Berkeley, where they
scored a tremendous success.
Harry \V. Baldwin of California
will sing his well known "Song of
Hybrias the Cretan." His strong
bass voice proves a great rival to
C. L. Firebaugh, who will also be a
soloist. The California string
quartette, which made a hit on
their southern trip, will play the
"Traumerei" by Schumann.
The advance sale for seats has
been equal to that of any concert
this year. Tickets will be on sale
tomorrow at University Bookstore
and I'alace Pharmacy.
The Stanford Glee Club will sing
the opening song promptly at 8:15.
The train held over for those
leaving after the concert etxrts
from I'alo Alto at 10:45.
