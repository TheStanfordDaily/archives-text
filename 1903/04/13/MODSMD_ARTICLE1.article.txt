For the fourth consecutive year
Stanford lias lost the Intercollegiate
baseball series, The second game,
played on the campus diamond
Saturday afternoon, proved a clear
cut victory for California by the
score of 9 to 1. Overall pitched
for California and proved effective,
lie allowed only three hits, two of
which were credited to Captain
Brown, but was wild at times, hit
ting two men, striking out only two,
and giving four bases on balls.
Tritch, who was opposed to the
California veteran, pitched a strong
and steady game. The California
batters secured ten hits, two of
which were of the scratch order,
but at no time,did Tritch lose his
excellent control. He gave only
two bases on balls and struck out
six men.
California won the game by hard
hitting and good fielding, which
kept the Stanford batting average
down to very small figures. She
scored her first run on errors in the
second inning and added to this
lead in the fourth, sixth, and ninth.
Stanford rallied in the eighth and
got three men on bases, but after
Brown scored the only run the side
was retired on a lucky double play.
In the ninth Stanford's forlorn
hope failed to materialize and the
second and deciding game of the
series became California's by a
good score.
Each nine got a man to third in
the first inning, but no score was
made until the second, when
Overall hit to right field, went to
third on Hatch's two-base hit a
foot within the foul line and scored,
on a passed ball by McGilvray.
In the fourth, California brought
in three runs. Heitmuller received
a base on balls and went to third
on Tritch's wild throw of Overall's
grounder. Beth scored on Hatch's
fly to deep center, and Hatch came
home on Adams' out. The side
was retired by Causley, who was
caught off second. In the seventh
