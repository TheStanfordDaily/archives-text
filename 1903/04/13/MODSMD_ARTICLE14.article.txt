No one regrets the loss of a game
when the players have played their
best and have prepared themselves
to play their heat, and the dissatis
faction with which the student
body looks forward to our Intercol
legiate tennis meet next Saturday

given her representatives a chance
to win. Without entering into the
rights and wrongs of the question,
the fact that a week before the
Intercollegiate Stanford tennis men
cannot play on a court which ordi
narily could have been completed
in ten days' time, but which bus
not been finished even after several
months' work, shows a lack of h:ir
niony, responsibility, or business
management on the part of student
body officials. The student body
has a right to expect better results
from those it selects to do its work.
