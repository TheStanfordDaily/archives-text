# EASTER SERVICES.
## Sermon in Morning by Dr. Newton. Address by Chaplain Gardner. Special Music. 
### 
Easter Sunday was observed in
Memorial Church by special music
and appropriate sermon and ad
dress. In the morning Mrs. Mary
Roberts Smith sang "The Lord is
Risen," and S. P. Frisselle took the
solo part in the anthem. Miss
Stella Sankey sang in the afternoon.
Chaplain Gardner spoke in the
afternoon on "The Resurrection."
Dr. Newton preached in the
morning on "Immortality," the
special aspect of the subject con
sidered being the bearing of science
upon this hope and faith.
Immortality rests on proofs be
low the realm with which science
deals. It has not waited for the
age of science to find the ground
on which it now rests itself. From
the nature of the case does it con
cede for a moment that those
grounds can be seriously disturbed
by aught which science is likely to
discover. But, nevertheless, the
magnificent discoveries of science
have created predispositions,which,
in our age, prejudice this faith in
many minds, and make it harder
for us all to believe as simply as
our fathers believed. We must
await the sure coming of the day
when mental and moral philosophy
will recover their authority and
balance the influence of science.
Evolution now seems to make
against this faith by displacing
man from the proud position tra
ditionally assigned him, whereon
it was easy to conceive of him, the
special creation of God, as destined
for such a splendid future. But
evolution is now seen to replace
man on his old position of unique
ness in creation â€”as he is proven
by it to be the very crown and
consummation of nature's process
es, the apparent end for which she
travails through the ages.
The tendency toward a material
istic interpretation of life, so natu
ral to science, creates, again, a pre
disposition against the faith in
immortality. This, however, is
being corrected at the hands of the
great savants, to whom matter is
becoming so mysterious, so all
alive. so entirely a mask of force,
so instinct with mind as to, at
least, leave the way open for a
spiritual interpretation of nature.
And Science, in entering the field
of psychology, is discovering that
which doth "give us pause" in any
rash dogmatism upon the possibility
of man's surviving death. Psychics
is correcting the one-sidednesn of
physics. The border-land between
mind and matter, now, for the first
time in history being scientifically
studied, is opening strange sur
prises for the practical man. "In
the abysmal deeps of personality"
there is already being seen that
which reveals man as a being over
whom death can have no dominion.
