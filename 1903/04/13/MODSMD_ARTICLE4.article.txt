# The 						Combined Concert.

### 
The Combined Concert given by
the Berkeley and Stanford Mando
lin and Glee Clubs in Assembly
Hall last Saturday night was not
largely attended, yet every number
was cncored several times by the
audience. The renditions of the
California Banjo Club proved as
enjoyable as they were novel at
Stanford. Their "Mill in the
Forest" was very effective and odd.
Morse of California took Leo
Byrne's place as monologist and
spun the old yarn of the "Dutch
man's Autobiography," and"The
Boy Stood on the Burning Deck."
The string quartette after playing
Schumann's "Traumerei," was re
called to give other pieces.
The soloists cf the evening were
H. Baldwin of California and C. L.
Firebaugh, '04.
