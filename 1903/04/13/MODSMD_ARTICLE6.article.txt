A Bible-class rally and social
was given by the Y. W. C. A. and
Y. M. C. A. Friday evening, April
10th, at Roble. Professor Murray
spoke on 'The Bible as a Monu
ment of Literature," and Chaplain
Gardner on "The Practical Side of
Bible Study." "The Bible classes
should meet in the different sorori
ties and fraternities, and a popular
meeting should be held on the
quad. There should also be a class
to prepare leaders, and a normal
Bible class to prepare for teachers."
Miss Pearl Bartlett, '04, sang.
During the evening games were
played and light refreshments
were served.
