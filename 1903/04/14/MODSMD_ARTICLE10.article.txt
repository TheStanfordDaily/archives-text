# ROOF GIVES WAY.
## Tiling of Mechanical Engineering Laboratory Proves Too Heavy for Support. 
### 
A few minutes past two this
afternoon the Louvre roof of the
Mechanical Engineering laboratory
collapsed. For several days work
men about the building have heard
cracking noises in the roof, and as
long ago as Saturday a slight sag
ging was noticed; but it was not
until this afternoon that the dan
ger became evident. About half
past one the cracking noises grew
louder and of more frequent occur
rence. The girders of the Louvre
roof were torn away from the south
side, and the roof settled with a
crash into the iron girders of the
main roof.
Considerable apprehension was
felt at first that the supports of the
main roof itself might give way,
and it was a great relief to the
onlookers to find that it was only
the comparatively unimportant
upper structure which was falling
in.
The Mechanical Engineering lab
oratory is one of Stanford's new
buildings, having been occupied by
the department for the first time
last semester. The department
had nothing to do with the con
struction of the building except in
the drawing up of the ground
plans.
The accident was caused by lack
of strong braces, the wooden girders
being either too weak for the
structure or insecurely fastened.
It is impossible to state without an
investigation who is to blame for
the poor construction.
Workmen are now removing the
loose tiling and bracing the east
wall of the Louvre roof, but noth
ing further will l>e done toward
repairing the damage, estimated at
from one thousand dollars to twelve
hundred dollars, until Resident
Architect Hodges, who is now in
San Francisco, has inspected the
wreck.
