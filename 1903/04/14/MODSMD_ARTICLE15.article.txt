The expediency of medal, cup,
and prize giving has been brought
more prominently before the stu
dents of Stanford and Ihe State
University within the last two
weeks than ever before. In the
past, it has occasioned remarks
that such little recognition is given
athletes in the Pacific Coast uni
versities. The offer of the Univer
sity Club comes as a remedy for
this lack of recognition. And it is
with pleasure that the student body
acknowledges the offer of Mr. Ross.
The debaters have an immense
amount of work to do, and when
compared to athletes do not seem
to be as generally appreciated.
