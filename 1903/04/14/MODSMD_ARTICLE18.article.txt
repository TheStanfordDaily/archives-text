The third edition of Instructor
Cook's book,"Roderick Talliaferro,''
has been put on salt-. The first
edition, of two thousand five hun
dred copies, was bought up within
a day after issuance. The book
has been highly praised by the
New York Commercial Advertiser,
the Chicago Tribune, and several
other authoritative Eastern reviews,
predicting that the book would
have a large sale. Very favorable
criticism was given it by G. H.
Fitch, literary critic of the San
Francisco Chronicle.
The only change to be made in
the book will be made in the third
edition. A finer frontispiece will be
putin and the other illustrations
in the body of the book will be
shifted to suit the contents more
closely.
