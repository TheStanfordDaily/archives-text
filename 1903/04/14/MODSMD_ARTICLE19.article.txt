# Worth More Than Admission Fee.

"The Pasmores" will give a con
cert at San Mateo Wednesday eve
ning under the patronage of many
of the social leaders cf that town
and Burlingaine, for which the
teats are held at one dollar.
Mr. Pasmore has placed the
price of admission to the concert in
Assembly Hall Thursday evening
at the nominal sum of twenty-five
cents, in order that every student
may have an opportunity to hear
a really tine program almost with
out cost. Being a firm believer in
the power of good music to give the
highest enjoyment to all who have
artistic 'sense, Mr. Pasmore ar
ranges the program accordingly.
The biggest number on Thursday
evening s program is Mendelssohn's
celebrated "D minor" trio for piano,
violin, and cello. It presents great
difficulties to the players and is
comparatively hard for the listener
to grasp, but still the themes are
so very musical, and thoroughly
melodious, the rythmsare so genial
and compositions fairly bristle with
difficulties for the performers â€”no-
tably the arias from Mozart's
"Magic Flute," one of which touches
the high "F," and in the Cadenza
"G," and the "Russian Airs" for
violin by YVieniawski, which has
exceedingly difficult harmonic pas
sages and which is one of Ysaye's
concert solos.
