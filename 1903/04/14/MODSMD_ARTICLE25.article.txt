The first spring practice for foot
ball men yvhb held last Friday af
ternoon on the University oval.
About fifteen men appeared for
work. Bansbach outlined his pur
pose in making an early start in
stead of waiting for the fall term to
begin the light work of training.
For an hour the men punted and
practiced catching spiral kicks. Al
though the work appeared to be of
a rather desultory character it is
laying the groundwork upon which
can he built first-class efliciency
next fall. For the last two seasons
Stanford has been weak in her
kicking material, and last season
especially there was in evidence a
remarkable tendency on the part
of the back-field to drop spirals
and hard punts. Although the
spring work is of the lightest char
acter, it should work to obviate this
element of weakness in the team.
The men are expected to keep no
training rules, and do not appear
in football clothes. Light foot
work and kicking constitute the
routine of the afternoon practice.
The percentage of last year's Var
sity men who have comeout is still
small, but with the close of the
baseball season there should bean
impetus to the football work. Cap
tain Bansbach expects to continue
the light training until the period
of examination shall make it in
convenient for the men to come out
in the afternoon.
