# MR. ROSS OFFERS PRIZE
## One Hundred Dollars to go to Winners of the Intercollegiate Debate. 
### 
The following letter addressed to
Dr. Jordan is self-explanatory:
"The Palo Alto of Friday last
stated that up to date no prize had
been provided for the winning
team in the Intercollegiate debate
between the University of Califor
nia and Stanford. Such being the
fact, and as 1 have two sons who
will graduate this year, one from
the afliliated colleges of the Uni
versity of California and one from
Stanford, and I am the recipient of
the bounties of the two universities,
it may not be inappropriate for me
to now offer something in the way
of a prize to the winners of the
debate.
"To that end will you please
accept the enclosed check for $100,
and make such use of it as you
shall deem proper, and oblige,
"Yours sincerely,
"Geo. C. Ross."
The prize for several years past
has been offered by James K.
Mofiit, a graduate of California.
Geo. C. Ross is a lawyer living
in Belmont, with offices in Red
wood City. He is- the father of
Hall C. Ross, '03.
