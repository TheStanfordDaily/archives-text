# Investigation of Typhoid Epidemic.
## 
### 
On account of the recent develop
ment of so many cases of typhoid
fever on the campus, a careful
investigation of the source of infec
tion has been made by the Univer
sity and county officials, in con
junction with the I'alo Alto health
board. The result of the investi
gation points toward the source
being the milk supplied by a single
route —that of Mr. Loder—and in
all cases thus far developed on the
campus it has been found that
milk from this source has been
used. This dairy has been closed,
and careful inspection made of the
others established. There is no
basis for anticipating the contrac
tion of the disease by those who
were not infected previous to the
closing of this dairy. There may
be a few more cases during this
week, as the incubation period of
typhoid fever ranges between one
and three weeks.
