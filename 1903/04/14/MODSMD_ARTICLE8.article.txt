# THE 						SONATA FORM
## Mrs. Raymond Brown, Thorough Master of Her Subjectf Pleased All Who Heard Her. 
### 
The recital given by Mrs. Ray
mond Blown Monday afternoon at
the home of Mrs. A. VV. Smith in
I'alo Alto was one of the musical
treats of the year. Mrs. Brown's
delightful personality as well as
her thorough mastery of her sub
ject made her talk a most interest
ing one, while her wonderful
technique and sympathetic inter
pretation of the old masters was
remarkable.
Mrs. Brown represents a new
idea in music and in the teaching
of music â€”the idea of analysis for
the pleasure of understanding. She
shows the development of the
sonata from its original theme,
through the elaborations of the
figure, the inversions, reversions,
variations, the minuet, the ronda,
to the brilliant and striking cada
which rounds up and completes
the harmony and emotions of the
entire composition.
This analysis, however, occupies
hut a fraction of the time and the
remainder is given over to a pro
gram of classic music such as we
do not often hear. Mrs. Brown is
and accomlished musician and,
after the exposition of the nature
and qualities of the sonata, it gives
her audience a double pleasure to
hear the masterpieces of Beethoven
and Schumann so beautifully ren
dered.
The lecture began with a short
outline of the development of the
sonata, explaining its division
into three parts, and illustrating
by a nimpie sonata of dementi's.
Taking up Beethoven's ''Moonlight
Sonata," she described its diverg
ence from the ordinary form, show
ing the prominence of the third
part of the theme instead of the
first, and playing with remarkable
expression.
The second recital will take place
at 4:80 tomorrow, and the third
