# Band to Give Dance.
## 
### 
The University Band will give
another dance in Palo Alto, April
25th, in Mullen's Hall, to help pay
for the new instruments which the
members have secured.
The last dance was not a success
financially, but feeling that another
dance would receive better support
the managers have set a date for
April 25th. Details concerning the
program and price of admission
will be given within a few days.
