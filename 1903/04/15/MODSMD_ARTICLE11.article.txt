# Repairs on Engineering Roof.
## 
### 
A force of men has been busy
today removing the tiles from the
wrecked Louvre roof of the Mechan
ical Engineering laboratory. Most
of the tiles are not damaged.
Resident Architect Ilodgea re
turned from San Francisco today
and inspected the wrecked roof.
He is at loss to account for the
accident, except thas the beams
supporting the roof were not prop
erly nailed.
Mr. Hodges expects to have the
building repaired by the middle of
next week. The same size beams
will be used, but some strong cross
beams will be put in.
