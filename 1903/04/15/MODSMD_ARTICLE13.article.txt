A handbook of the Iceland Stan
ford Junior Museum has been pre
pared by the University authorities
and published by the University
Press. It, is a small fifteen-page
booklet, tastefully bound in red
matting, with general directions to
visitors and short descriptive arti
cles of the more important collec
tions. The booklet is illustrated
by two diagrams, showing the pres
ent building and the additions now
under construction. At this time
it is impossible to give more than a
general idea of the Museum, be
cause with the completion of the
building in 1906 an entire re
arrangement will be made of ex
hibits. A more comprehensive
guide-book will then be issued.
