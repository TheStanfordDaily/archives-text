The captain, coach, and members
of the track team are showing an
admirable spirit in regard to the
discouragements which they have
had to face. The team has suffered
more than any team Stanford has
ever had, yet the men will go to
Berkeley next Saturday determined
to take every place that they are
able to take. Since the beginning
of the year there has been less dis
tention on the track than on any
team we have ever had. The men
have trained hard, and deserve to
win. Even with a weakened team
the meet between the two uni
versities will be a close one, and in
consequence the team will need the
support of the student body. Some
men go through their events and
hear nothing that is said to I hem
by the bleachers, others are in
spirtd by the cheers of their college
matep.
