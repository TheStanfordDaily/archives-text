# Professor Alden's New Book.

### 
Prof. Raymond Macdonald Alden
of the English department lias re
cently received his new book from
Molt & Co. of New York, entitled
''English Verse." It is a work de
signed primarily for a text-book
and contains specimens illustrat
ing both the history and principle
of ICnglish poetry. Its aim is to

present material for the inductive
study of English verse.
In this book Professor Alden has
endeavored to avoid the setting
forth of his own opinion and to
present the subject-matter in a way
suited, bo far as possible, to the use
of those holding widely divergent
views. He has divided his speci
mens of verse into two main 'divi
sions, illustrating respectively the
history and principle of English
verse.
Part I contains specimens de
signed to illustrate the principles of
English verse, arranged in topical
order. Part II contains poems
designed to show (he history of the
more important forms of English
poetry, arranged in the several
divisions in chronological order.
Part ill contains the author's
own views on such subjects as the
relations of time and accent in our
verse, the presence of "quantity" in
English, and the terminology of
the subject. l'art IV contains
extracts from important critical
writers on the place and function
of the verse element in poetry â€”
matters which give us the raison d'
etre for the whole study of versifi
cation.
The author has resisted strenu
ously all temptation to choose or
to annotate specimens on the
ground of aesthelicenjovmentapart
from the distinct study of verse
forms, but has attempted to make
of it a text-book for students which
shall be both instructive and enter
taining.
The book is being used as
reference and text-book in some of
the English courses at present, and
will be regularly adopted in the
Introduction to Poetry courses next
year.
