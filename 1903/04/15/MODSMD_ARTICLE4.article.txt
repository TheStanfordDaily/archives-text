# Repairing the Organ.
## 
### 
The repairs of Memorial Church
organ, which was partially put out
of use two weeks ago by the rain
leaking into the pipes, will be com
pleted in time for next Sunday's
services. It was found necessary
to putin a number of new pneu
matic vaives in place of those
ruined by the water. All the
working parts were left open for a
considerable time to dry out. In
some cases the water had run down
through the pipes into the more
delicate parts below, and thus
ruined some of the stop actions.
Organist Scott Brook, with assist
ance of R. U. Fitting, '04, and two
workmen, has been doing the
work.
