# THE 						TRACK TEAM.
## Varsity Men Full of Fight, Though Weakened by Loss of Many Men. 
### 
The last three weeks have clone
much to dim the Cardinal'schances
in the Intercollegiate meet next
Saturday, yet with the certainty
turned to doubt, every man on the
squad is full of tight. All are con
fident of victory, and the State
University will not get a point
without a close contest. Stanford
has lost eleven men since Christ
mas, all of them likely point
winners—among them J. C.Tay
lor, '04. Varsity hurdler; F. L.
Turpin, '06, and J. J. Hayward,
'0(3, both good men in the sprints;
through sickness, A. S. Henley, '04,
Varsity jumper, Sprague, '04, two
miler, H. L. Hamilton, '04, Varsity
sprinter, W. It. Hamilton, '03, Var
sity distance man, L. Lyons, '03,
Varsity jumper; through leaving
college, A. B. Swinerton, '04, dis
tance man; through breaking
training rules. Ball, '06, and Ab
bott, '06, both with good records
in the jump. With these
eleven men on the team there
could be no doubt of the outcome
of the meet.
The rest of the squad, undis
mayed, are being coached in the
finer points of the sport by Trainer
Moulton. All of them have been
willing to work, and Moulton has
had to watch them in order to keep
them from overdoing.
The Cardinal will have first
place fighters in every event. In
the hundred and two-twenty will
be McCaughern and Hawley; in
the quarter, Dunn, Crossman, and
Smith; in the half-mile, Holman,
Thomson, and Gay; in the hurdles,
Kuhn, Naramore, and Weller,
who is also a reliable man for the
weights and jumps; in the weights,
Hyde, Crawford, Estes,and Weller;
in the pole-vault, Dole, Beach,
Whitaker and Bell. Stanford will
have an especially fast relay team
in Dunn, Crossman, Smith, Wilfred
Dole, and Thomson The distance
for each man in the relay is three
hundred and fifty-two yards.
Everyone was expecting to see a
record-breaking race between the
Slate University's captain, Cado
gan, and Dunn, Smith, and Cross
man in the quarter, but in all
probability Cadogan will confine
liis efforts to the hundred and two
twenty and not enter the quarter.
Throughout the season California
has had over .a hundred men on
the oval training for the Intercol
legiate. Of these men Wilcox, the
pole-vaulter, has been considered
the most thorough athlete and con
sistent performer. The contest
between Wilcox and Norman Dole
for first place in the vault should
tie one of the features of the meet.
Both men have gone over 11 feet.
