## 
### 
Two boats were received yester
day evening from San Francisco
and are now at the boat-house on
Lagunita. The larger boat is a
racing barge to be used by four
men and a coxswain. It was built
by Al. Rogers of Oakland and it
and its oars were bought from the
Columbia Boat Club of Oakland
for $150. This boat is exactly
like the one used by the men row
ing at California. Prof. A. W.
Smith, who is interested in pro
moting rowing at Stanford, con
siders it a very fine boat. The
smaller boat was loaned by the
University of California Boat Club.
It accommodates two rowers and a
coxswain.
Considerable interest is being
taken in the new sport, and prac
tise on Lagunita will begin at once.
Professor Smith believes that inter
class boat races can be held there
next spring and that the lirst
match against California can be
held a year from next fall.
