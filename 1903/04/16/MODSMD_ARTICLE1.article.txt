# TO FORMALLY RETIRE
## Mrs. Stanford to Transfer Control of University to Trustees April Twenty-fifth. 
### 
At a meeting of the Board of
Trustees of the University to be
held at Mrs. Stanford's San Fran
cisco residence Saturday, April
25th, the surviving Founder of the
University will formally give over
the control of the University, which
she has maintained since the death
of Senator Stanford, to the Board
of Trustees. Immediately after,
Hon. S. F. Leib will give way to
Mrs. Stanford, as president of the
Board of Trustees.
No formal cermony will mark
the transfer of the University
property to the Trustees. While
the step is far-reaching in its im
portance, no actual changes will be
evinced in the management of the
University, since as president of
the board. Mrs. Stanford will
nominally direct the expenditure
of money.
Upon the completion of the
buildings at present in process of
construction, which is expected to
come in about a year, the Trustees
will immediately begin the de
velopment and enlarging of the
faculty, and a considerable increase
in the number of books in the
Library will follow. Another year
will see several additions to the
faculty, and the salaries of quite a
few of the present faculty may
be then increased.
The formal transfer of the con
trol of the University follows as a
result of Mrs. Stanford's decision
announced by Dr. Jordan at a
meeting of the Stanford alumni
held in San Francisco, February
14lh. Provision for the transfer
was made possible by the recent
passage of certain bills by the
State legislature.
