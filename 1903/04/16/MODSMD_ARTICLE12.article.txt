Thk student body election takes
place Ihe last Wednesday of this
month and it is time for the student
body to pick the men that it wants
to see in office, the men who know
student body affairs and can do
effective work, rather than wait for
any man or "gang" of men to pick
those who shall hold office. Within
the last year Stanford undergradu
ates have had some severe lessons in
politics, and as a result the poli
tician should find a barren field
on which to sow his crop of jobbery.
Talks of ''fiat" and "anti-frat" are
wool-pulling devices that lead the
unsophisticated to ignore the vital
questions: "Is lie a Stanford man?
Is he the most capable man for the
position?" The part that Roble
has played in politics has been
severely commented upon by the
Chaparral. The chief cause for
trouble in the past has not been so
much that those casting ignorant
vote* have done so because they did
not wish the best candidate elected.
Ignorant voles in general are cast
conscientiously, but the under
graduate conscience needs to be
broadened. As I)r. Jordan said in
the University Assembly a few
weieks ago, unless the voter knows
the qualifications of the candidate
his ballot should lie withheld. Too
often candidates are run who are
not known by thejstudent body,and
qualifications may he attributed
to them which they have not.
