# "QUAD" APPEARS IN MAY.
## 1904 Class Annual Almost Ready for Binding. â€” Statistics Figure Prominently. 
### 
Work on the 1904 annual is
proceeding very satisfactorily. The
final proofs will be read early next
week, and the book will go to press
at that time. This year's Quad is
to make its appearance the first
week in May, with an edition of
about the usual size.
The annual this year aims to be
more of a year-book than hereto
fore following more closely the
custom of the annuals in Eastern
institutions. Every college activity
will be traced from its beginning,
and full statistics of the college
papers will be given. Theeditors-in
chief, business managers, and asso
ciate editors of all the publications
from the first number will be found
in the respective departments,
while in athletics the captains and
managers will be given, as are the
heads of all the other .various fields
in undergraduate affairs since the
opening of the University.
The usual space will be given to
photographs, art work, and "josh"
matter. As special features there
will be articles by Dr. Jordan on
"The Report of a Stanford Trustee
in 1912," a retrospect of the first
twenty-one years of the University;
one by Prof. A. G. Newcomer on
"The Publications of Stanford";
another by Dane Coolidge, '98, on
"The Camp"; and one by C. W.
Thomas, '03, on "The Year in Ath
letics." Bristow Adams, ex-'Ol,
will tell the history of the Chapar
ral. Mrs. Mary Roberts Smith
will contribute a new Stanford
song.
