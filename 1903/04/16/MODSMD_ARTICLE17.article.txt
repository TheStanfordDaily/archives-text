# Review of "Sequoia."
## 
### 
The current number of the Sequoia,
which was placed on sale today, has
one Btory which far surpasses tlie
average Sequoia story, "Ryerson's
Annie" by Gertrude M. Henry,'o3,
dealing with the rough life of the
plains. A girl is the heroine,
pimple, unassuming, plodding along
in quiet resignation. There is a
tone to the story that only sincer
ity can lend. It is by far the best
work in the issue. T. IS. Stephen
son, '03, contributes another of his
Texan dialect stories. "Chin Wall's
Mother" by H. A. Moran '04, is the
title of a clever sketch dealing with
Chinese life. Edytli Hale, '04,
contributes "Alias Burke." To
the Sketc-hßook Ralph Renaud,
'03, contributes "Lost Eden," pow
erful in its simplicity, done with a
delicacy of touch that makes
childhood with all its delightful
quests a thing of only yesterday;
and C. B. Wintler, '04, has "Be
yond the Swallows." There is a
noticeable absence of verse, "Ques
tionings" by E. F. P., and "Vale"
by Hallett Abend being the only
contributions.
The editorial is pertinent and
forceful. The Sequoia has spoken

frequently of Stanford spirit during
the college year. The current edi
torial maintains the same high
plane its predecessors have estab
lished, voicing as it does the atti
tude of the men who are for Stan
ford whole-heartedly, in victory as
in defeat.
