# Talks on Sonata Form.
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon at the home
of Mrs. A. YV. Smith a good audi
ence listened to Mrs. Raymond
Brown's second interpretation of
the sonata form.
Mrs. Brown followed up her
discussion of Monday, and applied
her analysis to sonatas hy Grieg
and Beethoven. Music is a subtle
art. People want to know what
story it is that tlie composer in
tends to convey. To many, im
agery in words gives real aid in
interpreting music. In music,
whatever one hears, sees, thinks, is
truth to him. Schumann aptly
expressed this feeling in saying
"Where speech ends, there music
begins."
Classical music is tquite distinct
from program music. The latter
has itÂ« natural place on the dra
matic stage, where it is aided hy
scenery and words. If robbed of
its settings it may become classical;
it has filled its mission if it can
arouse the emotions and picture
something to the mind.
The highest type of music is that
which is limited hy no condition,
and of this the sonata family forms
the largest proportion. Mrs.
Brown explained that the object of
analysis is to train the ear to listen
unconsciously. Otherwise the gen
eral effect is noticed, without an
appreciation of the real beauty of
the sonata form. She then played
Grieg's sonata in E minor, an ex
ample of the Norwegian style. It
is based on weird harmonies that
almost like discords, but which
have their own beauty. This w:is
followed by Beethoven's "Wald
stein" sonata.
