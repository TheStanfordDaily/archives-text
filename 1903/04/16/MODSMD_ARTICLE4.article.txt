Nibley will argue the negative in
behalf of the Freshmen. \V. L.

omores, and R. Howard for the
F res h men.
Almost all of the speakers have
had more or less experience in
debating. Alcott has appeared in
all the University try-outs this
year. He is a member of Nestoria
Literary Society. Swing debated
with the San Bernardino high
school team, and is a member of
Nestoria. Dey represented the
Portland high school in debates
against the freshmen of Oregon and
Washington Stale universities. He
made the '05 Freshman team, and
is a member of Euphronia.
Cunha debated for the San Jose
Normal School last year, while
Maloy spoke with the San Jose
high school team.' Nibley has been
a member of the Freshman Debat
ing Society.
The judges who will pass upon
ine merits of the debate are Prof.
Nathan Abbott and Instructor J. T.
Burcham of the Law department,
and Instructor L. E. Bassett of the
English department. Dr. R. M.
Alclen will preside.
Both teams have been chosen at
closely contested try-outs; and after
several weeks of thorough prepara
tion, ought to put up an interest
ing contest. The Freshman-
Sophomore debate is the only
event of its kind that remains
from the list of interclass and inter
society debates and oratorical con
tests that existed in the earlier
years of the University. An over
flow of class spirit plays no small
part in the features that make this
event interesting.
The debate is called for 7:45.
