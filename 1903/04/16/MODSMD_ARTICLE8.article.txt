# WEIHE AND BAKER.
## Two of Last Year's Varsity Men Will Play Tennis for Stanford Next Saturday. 
### 
Harry W'eihe, '08, and Cleve
Baker, *04, will represent Stanford
in both doubles and singles in the
mutch against tlie State University
Saturday morning on the Califor
nia Club court.
George Hodge, '06, won the first
singles tournament, which was
instituted to pick the best singles
player among the candidates for
places on the Varsity. C. B. Hop
per, '05, was the only man entered
for the tournament to pick the
second best man and was
entitled to play Hotlge and the
Varsity men in the round-robin
tournament, which was to definitely
pick the two men who were to rep
resent Stanford in the singles.
W'eihe, who on account of an
injured arm had withdrawn, re
entered the tournament today
when it'was found that it would be
necessary for him to do so if Stan
ford was to send anything like an
adequate lepreeentalion against
California. Hodge, who otherwise
would have taken a place in the
singles and been Baker's partner
in the doubles, has been taken down
with the typhoid fever. His ill
ness has forced him to default.
Hopper defaulted to W'eihe and
was beaten by Baker yesterday
afternoon. The result it that
W'eihe and Baker will represent
Stanford in the singles.
AHhi and Burr, who won the
doubles tournament, to facilitate
matters, and realizing that they
were outclassed by the two Varsity
men, willingly defaulted to them
this morning. Thus W'eihe and
Baker will also represent Stanford
in the doubles.
Veteran Joe Dai ley, the profes
sional of the California Club, will
probably referee the contest. The
linemen have not yet been chosen.
The California courts are located
on the corner of Scott and Bush
streets. They may be reached by
Sutter street cars, stopping at Bush.
In the Intercollegiate tourna
ment Baker will probably face
Baker of California, and W'eihe will
play McGavin. The California
doubles team is composed of Mc-
Gavin and Variel. Variel is a
freshman.
