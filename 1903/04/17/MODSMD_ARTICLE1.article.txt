Tomorrow afternoon on the
Berkeley oval the Stanford track
team meets the State University
for the eleventh time. Stanford
has been defeated every time but
once, when the score whs tied.
Many times the Cardinal chances
have been bright, but sickness and
unexpected accidents have proved
Stanford's undoing. Last year a
new regime was instituted. Fall
training, a coach who was to give
the team his undivided attention,
and serious work and thought on
the part of the candidates combined
to put forth a winning team.
That team was defeated, but it has
formed the nucleus of this year's
team. Though weakened by the
loss of several old Varsity men, the
team ought to win tomorrow, even
though by a narrow margin. Two
months ago the Stanford track
team was the best balanced
team on the Coast. There were
three men in every event with good
chances for first place. Yet the
team as it stands now will make a
strong fight for victory.
The team will number about
thirty-four men. Captain Mc-
Caughern has purposely cut his
team down and entered only the
men who can be depended upon to
do something for Stanford. In the
interests of clean sport he has not
overcrowded the events, so that
there may be no chance of jostling,
elbowing, spiking, or any sort of
jockeying.
Though the State University is
especially strong in the sprints,
McCanghern and Hawley can be
counted on for points. In the
hurdles Stanford has three good
men in Kuhn, Naramore, and
Weller, while U. C. stakes her
hopes on Hannigan. If Cadogan
enters the quarter, there will be a
record-breaking race between him
and Dunn and Crossman. All
three men have been close to 0:51.
In the half Stanford has such men
as Holman, Thomson, and Gay to
depend on. Holman ran Redewell
off his feet last year in the mile,
and this year be has done better
than ever before. The Berkeley
man who winn the half from either
Thomson or Holman will have to
run close to two minutes. Thom
son was beaten by Service, Berke
ley's best distance man, by only a
few feet in the last Intercollegiate
meet. Gay has been troubled for
some time with a bad leg, and may
not run up to his record.
In the mile Stanford has these

three men, with the addition of
Barrett, a new man who has shown
up remarkably well, and Fresh
man Lovell. With Sprague'e ill
ness Stanford's chances for first
place in the two-mile are lessened,
but Gundrum, Barrett, and Blod
gett are left.
The exact personnel of the relay
team will not be decided until just
before the race.
In the shot-put Hyde has fine
chances for the University Club
medal.
In the broad jump Stanford has
Henley, Weller, Naramore, and
West; in the high jump, Henley
and Bell. The pole-vault will be
one of the prettiest contests of the
day. Both Wilcox of California
and Dole of Stanford have done
over eleven feet in competition.
Jesse Beach did eleven feet easily
last night in practice. The Coast
record ought to go by the board
with three such men in the contest.
In the hammer-throw Weller,
Estes, and Crawford will throw for
Stan ford.

The question that will be dis
cussed in the annual debate be
tween Stanford and the University
of California reads as follows, "Re
solved, That the United States
government should not attempt
under all circumstances to prevent
the acquisition of territory in South
America by European powers."
O. C. Spencer, '04, Frank Roller,
'04, and H. M. Lewis, '04, will sup
port the affirmative for Stanford.
M. Thelan, '06, A. B. Weiler, '03,
and Alan Matthews, '03, will argue
the negative as representatives for
the Blue and Gold. In this con
test the Cardinal will be cham
pioned by three strong speakers
among whom there is no great dif
ference in ability.
O. C. Spencer will open the de
bate. His strong points are clear
ness and a wonderfully persuasive
delivery and enunciation, which
admirably fit him for his position
on the team. Spencer is not with
out experience. Before coining to
college he represented the Portland
University in two contests and was
easily the strongest man on those
teams. Since coming to college he
has debated with the '04 Freshman
team and was this year alternate
on the Carnot team. He is a mem
ber of Euphronia.
Frank Roelir speaks second on
the affirmative. Roelir has unus
ual control and a logical head. He
speaks with great ease and has a
polished delivery. His coolness
makes him the logical man to
handle the rebuttal speech with
which he will close the debate.
Roelir did his first debating at the

Intercollegiate Tennis, corner Scott and Bush streets, San Francisco, 9:30
Intercollegiate Field-day, Berkeley Oval, 2:00.
Intercollegiate Debate, Alhambra Theatre, Jones and Eddy streets, 8:00.

Santa Clara high school, where lie
was a member of the team that de
feated tlie San Jose high school.
He was a collegue of Spencer 011
the '01 Freshman team, and is well
known from his work in the debate
of this year. Roehr represents the
Collegiate Debating Society of San
Jose and is a member of the Kappa
Sigma fraternity.
11. M. Lewis, who will close the
positive argument for the affirma
tive, is the most animated speaker
011 the team. His advantage is
found in his rhetorical ability and
imposing delivery. Lewis came
into prominence last year as a
member of the Sophomore team
that defeated the '05 Freshman.
His excellent showing in the Car
not this year is still fresh in the
minds of those who attended.
Lewis is a member of Euphronia,
and of the Delta Upsilon fraternity.
Thelan and Weiler of the Cali
fornia speakers are well known
from thier work on the Carnot de
bate. Matthews is a new man in
varsity contests.
The judges selected to pass upon
the merits of the debate are Mr.
Win. Thomas, Mr. Peter F. Dunne,
and Mr. Henry \V. Brandenstein;
the first two are prominent attor
neys of San Francisco, the latter a
member of the board of supervisors.
Of the ten previous Intercollegi
ate debates Stanford has won four
and California six. California's
victory last year won for her the
Hearst trophy offered a few years
ago by Win. R. Hearst to the win
ner of the first three out of five
debates.
The debate tomorrow night will
begin at 8 o'clock in the Alhambra
Theatre, instead of the Metropolitan
Temple as in years before.

The tennis match tomorrow with
California finds the Varsity not
only crippled, put almost without
practice. At the beginning of the
season tennis hopes were very
bright, for there was an abundance
of new material, and new courts
were promised. But all this
has since been changed; the court
is still incomplete, and the team has
been crippled by accident and ill
ness. Baker and Weihe are both in
the city, and unless the rain inter
fered have had two practices, one
yesterday and one this morning.
A comparison of the pi a v of both
teams will not be uninteresting.
Drummond McGavin, Californias
best man, is a player of the first
class. He is very erratic, however,
and his periods of brilliancy are
often broken by mediocre play. If
McGavin has an off day the Cardi
nal may reasonably hope for victory
in the doubles. Variel is a com
paratively inexperienced man,while
