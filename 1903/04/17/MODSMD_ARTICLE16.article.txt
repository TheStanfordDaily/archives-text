# TRAINER RE-ENGAGED.
## "Dad" Moulton Will Remain in Charge of Track and Football for Two Years More. 
### 
"Dad" Moulton will remain at
Stanford for two years more in his
capacity of trainer and coach for
track, and trainer for football.
At thelast meeting of the Execu
tive Committee the question of en
gaging a trainer for next year was
broached, and Moulton was chosen
without debate. His services have
been secured for two years, at a
slight increase in salary.
"Dad" Moulton has been at
Stanford for two years, coming
from Notre Dame at the expiration
of "Doc" Murphy's term of control.
A trainer of track athletes, he
came with a brilliant reputation,
which he had gained by nearly
forty years of practical experience
on the track. A sprinter of the
highest order, "Dad" based his
knowledge as a trainer upon per
sonal experience. The reputation
he brought with him to Stanford
he has done much to increase since
his arrival on the Coast. He came
to Palo Alto the year after Stan
ford had been defeated in track by
the worst score the University of
California has ever run up. With
a few Varsity men as a nucleus
upon which to build, Moulton de
veloped a first-class team —a team
which but for an unusual series of
misfortunes would have had a fair
chance of victory. This year, ably
seconded by Captain McCaughern,
Moulton inaugurated fall training.
He instilled his spirit of confidence
into the team, and has put into the
field this year a team of which
every Stanford man is proud,
whether the result of tomorrow's
field-meet be victory or defeat.
