# The 						Pasmore Concert.
## 
### 
The concert given last night by
"The I'asmores" merited a large
house. There was nothing of the
'"prodigy" air about the three little
maids who gave renditions of which
many an adult performer might
well have been proud. The three
instruments, cello, violin, and
piano, were all subordinated to each
other in the trio work, a fact which
made the ensemble selections of the
young musicians especially pleas
ing. Miss Mary Pasmore, the vio
linist, surprising the audience with
the purity of her tone and her
splendid technique, was heartily
encored.
Miss Dorothy I'asmore, the cell
ist, played skilfully and with
sympathic expression. Susan Pas
more, the pianist,was at a disadvan
tage on occount of the poor piano.
She is a pupil of Arthur Ficken
scher, and gives promise of a bril
liant future. The vocalists assist
ing the Pasmores were good. Of the
three Mrs. Gardner was accorded
the heartiest encore.
