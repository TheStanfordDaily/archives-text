Tomorrow we meet the State
University in three contests. For
the field meet, the men have
trained hard and consistently.
Their fighting spirit is inspiring.
The tennis men, though unfortu
nate in being handicapped by a
lack of practice, will make a better
showing than seems to be expected
of them. The debaters are all of
them able men, and well prepared.
They do not go against the oppon
ents with other ideas than that the
contest will be close.
