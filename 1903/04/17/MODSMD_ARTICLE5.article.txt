Trainer Moulton's return next
year will be of far reaching import
ance. There will be no change of sys
tem,no break in continuity of meth
od. Stanford will begin next year
where she left off this year. "Dad"
Moulton's return makes her pros
pects for future victories more than
bright. Moulton himself has won
the respect of their.en he has
worked with, and as a coach, Stan
ford has had none better. The
fact that he has been engaged for a

two years' term even before the
Intercollegiate track meet speaks
much for the confidence which the
student body has in him.
