Students and others are ad
vised not to drink water from
any other source than the regu
lar water supplies of Palo Alto
and the campus. Indiscrimi
nate eating at various places is
also to be avoided. The fact
that the present typhoid fever
cases can be traced to certain
dairies which are now closed
does not remove the necessity
for proper sterilization of all
milk and cream, and the avoid
ance of raw vegetables.
