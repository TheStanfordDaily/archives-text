Stanford won, to 58ยง.
For the first time in the history of
Intercollegiate athletics, a Cardinal
track team was victorious over the
Blue and Gold. On their own track
the State University was defeated.

Stanford entered twenty-seven
men and California forty. Stan
ford took eight first places.
Throughout the fighting spirit of
the inen was wonderful. Every
man came up to what was expected
of him, many of them did more.
Though the U. C. track is a very
fust one, it is of a very confusing
and impracticable length; and the
Cardinal had trouble time and
again on account of innumerable
starts and finishes. The men were
in the finest condition and in the
best of spirits. Too much praise
cannot be given Captain McCaugh
ern and Trainer Moulton.
Everything that could possibly
be done to win the meet before the
actual running of the contestants,
was done.
The day was a fine one, and in
the enclosed oval there was not a
breath of wind stirring; so the
time in all the events was good.
There was an immense crowd of
spectators, most of them partisans.
The spirit between the two colleges
was courteous, particularly be
tween the contestants themselves.
There was but little jostling, and
what there was was unintentional.
The treatment and attitude of the
U. C. bleachers was uniformly
courteous, and the good perform
ances of the men from both col
leges were loudly cheered.

The meet was very close, as a
rule one team or the other being
hut two or three points ahead.
When the relay was called, the
State University was five points
ahead. But Dunn broke the tape
well ahead of Hannigan. So the
score was tied. Then YVeller, who
had already taken places in the
hurdles and hammer-throw, got
second in the broad jump, making
the score 55 to 58 in California's
favor. The last event of the meet
was the pole-vault. If Stanford
could get a first and second she
would win. The jumping contin
ued for an hour. Dole, Reach and
Whitaker for Stanford, Wilcox and
Symmes for U. 0., all went over
10:10. Then the bar was
raised to eleven feet one inch.
Dole and Beach cleared it. Whit
aker, Symmes and Wilcox failed,
and Stanford had the meet.
Straightway the Stanford bleach
ers, seizing "Dad" Moulton,
carried him round the oval. For
the first time in history a Stanford
crowd headed by their band danced
the serpentine and two-step of vic
tory on their rival's cinder-path.
After clearing the bar at eleven
feet three, Dole went on after the
Coast record. When he finally
quit vaulting he had made 11 feet
7 1-4 inches. The former Inter
collegiate record was 10 feet 10

inches,held byDole's brother, Chas.
Dole, '99. The Const record was
11 feet 3 7-8 inches. Dole's vault
is within 2 3-4inchesof the world's
record, held by R. C. Clapp at Yale.
Holman started the good work
for Stanford by winning the mile
easily from Hackley in a beautiful
race, Holman pulling away from
his man on the finish. Freshman
Lovell ran well and finished a close
third. In the first heat of the
hundred Cadogan strained a ten
don and was out of the field-day.
In the second heat Abadie won in
ten flat, with Ilawley but three
inches behind. In the final, which
was run in ten flat, Ilawley got an
easy second.
The Cardinal hurdlers were much
bothered by the heavy and clumsy
hurdles. Several times they were
nearly pitched headlong by strik
ing the top bars. In the final of
the high hurdles Kuhn got a third.
