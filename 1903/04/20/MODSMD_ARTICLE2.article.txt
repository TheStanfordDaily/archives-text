# DEBATE GOES TO STANFORD.
## Roehr, Spencer, and Lewis Get Decision Against California Team in the Eleventh Intercollegiate Meet. 
### 
With no less credit to the partic
ipants and in as close a contest, the
Stanford debaters followed up the
good work of the track team with a
brilliant victory over tho Blue and
Gold orators Saturday evening.
Long before the time set for the
debate, the Alhambra Theater was
filled with a large delegation from
each university and many of San
Francisco's citizens, all of whom
listened throughout with great in- 1
terest and appreciation. Each of
the speakers was well supported by
the rooters, who took advantage of
every intermission until the an
nouncement of the decision, when
the Stanford supporters poured i
forth all the voice that they had
remaining from the afternoon.
The question debated was, ''Re-|
solved, That the United States
should not attempt under all cir
cumstances to prevent the acquisi
tion of territory in South America
by European powers." President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the Uni
versity of California presided, and
Mr. William Thomas, Mr. Peter I<\
Dunne, and Mr. Henry W. Brand
enstein rendered the decision.
Stanford upheld the affirmative, j

and was represented by Omar Cor
win Spencer, '04, Frank Roehr, '04,
and Howard Milton Lewis, '04.
California's supporting the nega
tive was championed by Alfred
Bertram Weiler, '03, Allan Pome
roy Matthew, '03, and Max Thelan,
'04.
President Wheeler opened the
meeting with a few remarks, and
then introduced O. C. Spencer, the
first spenker of the evening. Spen
cer made a short exposition of the
question and outlined the case of
affirmative. He argued that the
Monroe Doctrine of the past had
not been one of total exclusion.
That the government of the United
States was one of reason and judg
ment, and that it is not consistent
with the spirit of the government
to prevent in every instance the
acquisition of territory in South
America by European powers; we
should judge each case on its mer
its, and should act only when our
honor and safety so demand. That
the United States must protect her
interests both at home and abroad,
and could not afford to assume a
hard-and-fast dictatorial attitude
in respect to the acquisition of
territory by foreign nations. The
speaker pointed out instances where
territorial acquisition in South
America had taken place without
protest from the United States
government. He also showed how
the United States had not in the
past hesitated to interfere wherever
her interests and rights demanded
interference. The argument of the
speaker throughout showed careful
and logical preparation. In addi
tion he was above his usual excel
lent form in enunciation and
graceful delivery. His fair and
careful opening speech no doubt
had much to do with the outcome
of the debate.
A. A. Weiler opened for the neg
ative. He argued that when the
United States permitted Europe to
acquire territory on the American
continent she was not following the
national policy, that the United

States had maintained a strict ob
servance of the no-acquisition pol
icy in that continent since 1893
and that such a course was abso
lutely necessary for the integrity
of the country and of the lesser
nations in the south who looked
to us for protection against Euro
pean encroachment. He attacked
Spencer's argument by contending
that the cases cited by the affirma
tive were either rights that had
been acquired prior to the enuncia
tion of the Monroe Doctrine or
were subsequently adjusted in ac
cordance with the non-acquisition
plan.
Frank Roehr continued the case
for the affirmative. He argued
that a set rule of total exclusion
was not conducive to the peace,
power, or reputation of the United
States nor to the interests of the
country it ought to protect. He
exhibited a very earnest and at
the same time unantagonistic man
ner.
Allan P. Matthew took up the
arguments of the negative with a
further contention that the policy
advocated by the negative has been
the defined policy of this govern
ment since the time of Monroe.
That it was imbedded in the breasts
of the people, and that its observ
ance was best for this country and
the South American republics as
well, irrespective of conditions.
H. M. Lewis closed the positive
argument. He devoted some time
to the arguments advanced by the
negative, and then argued that
where American interests were not
injured or the United States coasts
threatened, there was no possible
reason for preventing foreign ac
quisition of territory in South
America.
Max Thelan summed up the case
for the negative and showed the
dangers of giving even a foothold
in South America to any European
power. He also dwelt on the pres
ent flourishing condition of the
South American republics; and on
the fact that the policy of the
affirmative would jeopardize the
commercial possibilities of the
United States in this hemisphere.
Frank Roehr closed the case
for the affirmative and the debate
in a remarkable rebuttal speech.
He easily destroyed the statements
of the negative in regard to the
particular instances of territorial
acquisition mentioned earlier by
the affirmative. Roehr was cool
and concise, and wasted not a mo
ment of the comparatively short
time allotted him for rebuttal.
The judges were not allowed to
confer on the decision. The result
of their ballots was for the affirma
tive. Whether or not it was unan
imous is not known. Besides the
honor and the experience, the deci
sion carried with it one hundred
dollars in cash, which was offered
by George C. Ross of Belmont.
One-third of this prize goes to
each member of the winning team.
This victory also gives Stanford a
lead on the W. R. Hearst cup just
offered to the university first
winning three debates.
