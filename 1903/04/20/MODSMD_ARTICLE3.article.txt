# TENNIS MEN ARE DEFEATED.
## In Spite of Lack of Practise and Training, Both Weihe and Baker Put Up a Plucky Fight in Singles and Doubles. 
### 
The one defeat of the day of con
tests with the State University was
almost equal to a victory. The
spirit and form shown by the Stan
ford representatives under adverse
circumstances was indicative of
what the result might have been if
the new courts had been completed
in time.
In the singles match Weihe
showed extraordinary form, but the
pace told on his lack of condition
and he finally succumbed to the
fast and skilful game put up by
McGavin. McGavin had a lead of
two games in the first set, gained
by accurate driving, when Weihe
by brilliant returns of McGavin's
hard drives and clever cross-court
strokes gained a lead which he
kept until the score stood 5-4 and
40-30 in his favor. After a fierce
rally McGavin tied the score and
won the next two games and the
set. In the second set McGavin
took the first game. Then by the
most spectacular play of the day
Weihe took the next five games
and seemed to have the set well in
hand, but the phenomenal spurt
had been too much for him.
I McGavin took the' next six games,

the set, and the match by stead}*
accurate play.
Baker of Stanford took his first
set from Baker of California by the
score of 6-2. In this set he dis
played wonderful judgment in
gauging his opponent's high lobs.
Baker of California won the second
set by skillful lobbing. The third
and deciding set went to Baker of
California by the score of 0-0.
Baker of Stanford was not in the
physical condition to stand a gruel
ling match, and after the first set
he was entirely on the defensive.
Although California had already
won two matches, the doubles were
not without interest. Weihe, al
most recovered from his first
match, played a brilliant game.
Baker was still fatigued and did
not play his usual game. At times
Stanford's lack of team-work was
apparent, but the match was closer
than the score would seem to indi
cate.
The complete score follows:
McGavin (U. C.) beat Weihe (S.)
7-5, 7-5; Baker (U. C.) beat Baker
(S.) 2-6, 6-3, 6-0; McGavin and
Variel (U. C.) beat Weihe and
Baker (S.) 6-3, 6-3.
