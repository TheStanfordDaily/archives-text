"A Stanford man always re
juices when he realizes that he is up
against it, for he knows he can pull
out,"was said a few months ago by
a Stanford man, and never has the
spirit been made more manifest
than by the twenty-seven men
who went onto the State University
oval at Berkeley Saturday. It was
the greatest day for Stanford that
Stanford athletes have ever helped
Stanford to have, and it was done
in the face of discouragements, in
the midst of the enemy, and on the
enemy's track. And the best of it
all is that it was a clean victory
and played fair from start to
finish.
There is joy in the hearts of
Stanford men and women and con
gratulations are extended to the
men, the captain, and trainer. The
success of hard training, the stand
for training rules Trainer Moulton
and Captain McCaughern have
taken, and the victory—these
things are now matters of history,
and we are glad that we are Stan
ford men and women. Captain
McCaughern and Trainer Moulton
deserve the thanks of the student
body even to a greater extent than
we realize. Many of the twenty
seven athletes who fought for the
Cardinal Saturday were made on
the Stanford oval by McCaughern
and Moulton. Moulton has meant
much to Stanford- his methods,
his ''first place," "win" spirit—and
he is with us for two years longer.
And the debaters' victory, and the
spirited fight of the tennis men —
thess helped make the day a great
day for Stanford.
