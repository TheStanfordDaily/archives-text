# Typhoid Situation.

The exaggerated reports concern
ing the rapid increase in the num
ber of typhoid patients on the cam
pus and in Palo Alto have but
little foundation. In the last two
days there have been but few addi
tional cases reported in Palo Alto,
and the condition of those who are
sick is almost entirely one of im
provement. There have been no
deaths among the students and
only one among the residents of
Palo Alto. It is almost impossible
to obtain a complete list of those
who have become sick, as the doc
tors are inclined to regard the
slightest symptoms in a serious
light during the epidemic. The
children of Professors Angeli,
Wing, and Show are more or less
seriously ill. The men at the old
Delta Tau Delta house in Palo
Alto are progressing favorably.
R. D. Barrett, '04, who was very
seriously sick last night, has been
gradually improving throughout
the day. The men at the Lane
Hospital in San Francisco are re
ported to be improving rapidly.
Duval '04, and Sprngue, '04, are
the most seriously ill, but neither
is regarded as being in a critical
condition.
