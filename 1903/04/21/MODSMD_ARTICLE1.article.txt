# TALK ON NEWSPAPERS.
## Hon. Whitelaw Reid Discussed Past, Present and Future of Work in Relation to the Public. 
### 
The Hod. Whitelaw Ileid ad
dresed the students of theU Diversity
this morning on "Newspaper Work
from an Editor's Standpoint" with
special reference to it as a field for
young men. Mr. Reid said:
The American newspaper is a field
likely to appeal to young college
men and-it is being filled by them.
To see all forms of public life, to be
brought into contact with all the
movements of one's age, to mingle
personally with the men who run
things, has a charm for a young
man who wishes to rush into life.
Newspaper life and takes him be
hind the scenes, he sees what
is going on in the world and has a
wider acquaintance with men and
affairs than do the leaders of other
callings, doctors, lawyers, engineers,
and the men of trade and com
merce. The young newspaper
man reaps thefruitsof his vocation
early in life.
With all those things in his
favor, one who knows the news
paper w >rld is compelled to say to
the candidate as his first advice
the familiar word "Don't." A re
porter even though a gentleman
and directed by men who are gen
tlemen, must often find himself in
situations when the first impulse
of a gentleman is to shrink back.
The reporter must be used to doing
his most strenuous best when other
people are at ease, and then at
times turning in and doing it all
over again when his own nature
calls loudly for rest.
Other things, too, sometimes dis
regarded, mi]st be taken into con
sideration by the young man
entering this field. The physical
and moral changes which have
come over American journalism
during the last twenty years
amount to nothing less than revo
lution, and the moral changes have
been forced and necessitated by the
physical ones. Now papers of from
twelve to twenty-four pages are
sold for the same low price formerly
paid for the four-page paper. As
long as the public craze for quan
tity, not quality, keeps up, the
papers will give quantity.
The success of the one- and two
cent papers has given rise to some
misapprehensions. It is sometimes
thought that they have won their
enormous circulations by abstract
ing from the clientage of the older,
more established, and higher-priced
journals; the truth is, they have
generally created a new public, or
are supported by the people who
formerly took one paper and read
it, and now take several and re.id
none of them. Then it is amazing,
the number of people who will
roundly denounce a sensational
sheet in their home, and turn
around and buy it on the way
down town to business.
The newspapers today are better
arranged than ten or fifteen years
ago. The number of men with
well-grounded educations going
into newspaper work isgreater than
over before, and the effect of their
work is showing in the quality of
the matter turned out. Newspaper

men are better informed, and the
way the news is gleaned out of
every nook and corner of the coun
try and from all over the world, is
wonderful even to one to whom it
has grown to be an old story.
The field of the newspaper has
been widened. All the secrets
must go. The great American
daily, like the great American de
partment store, is a universal pro
vider. Everybody reads and abuses
them.
The one great fault in the mod
ern newspaper is the overshadow
ing importance of the business end
of the concern. Even in the papers
where editions are gotten out by the
hundred thousand, the price paid
for the paper hardly covers the
cost of the material used. The re
sult is that the newspapers are sup
ported by the great ad vertisers who
disfigure their columns. A paper
must be moulded finally by that
which supports it, and as long as
the subscription list of a journal is
far less a matter of moment to its
proprietor than the list of its adver
tising patrons, the paper will not
be in a position singly to serve the
interests of the public. If its sub
scription list does not go far toward
supporting it, it is likely, or rather
it is doomed to become one of two
things: a charity sustained by rich
benevolence, or a blackmailer or
partisan advocate of some nature,
whose interests are not at all those
of the general good.
The newspaper is more than a
register; it is a maker of public
opinion. And this brings out the
mutual responsibility of the press
and of the public. The sensation
alism, deplorable enough, has been
built up by the interaction of the
two.
In the future the newspaper man
must be able to see straight, think
straight, know things, and know
where to find things.
The road is long and arduous,
but there is power given into bis
hands in the end, more power than
falls to the lot of any other man.
He is not a prophet, but he is often
a voice of one in the wilderness of
wrong and oppression; he is far
from a priest, but more than any
Protestant pastor, mo,re even than
any Catholic confessor, he is given
the keys to mankind's convictions
and feelings; he is far from a king,
but he is more powerful than any
kingâ€”rather a king-maker.
