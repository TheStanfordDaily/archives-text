For those who stayed on the cam
pus because they had no faith in
the team, and thereby missed the
victory, we have no sympathy, not
that they denied themselves the
pleasure of witnessing and feeling
a part, even though the part of the
meekest freshman on the Stanford
bleachers, in the grandest victory
Stanford athletes have ever won,
but that they should have lucked
the fighting spirit of the team. If
there is any virtue in rooting it
will make itself felt when the team
is hard pressed, when there have
been discouragements, when it
is on its rivals campus and
needa to feel that its university is
behind it.
