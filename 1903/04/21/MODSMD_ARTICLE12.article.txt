It is not very often that Stan
ford members of the student body
are guilty of breaking Stanford
traditions. Saturday the bleach
ers saw wearing a Varsity sweater
student body official, one who
had no more right to wear
a big white "S" than he
has to call himself ex-President of
the United States. There can be
no excuse for such action â€”not the
slightest. It was a flagrant disre
gard of a tradition that is as old as

Stanford. We hope that some day
there will be a student body coun
cil, as there is at other colleges,
which can take such cases in hand
and deal with them as they
deserve.
