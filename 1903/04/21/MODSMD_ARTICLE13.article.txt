# The 						Typhoid Situation.
## 
### 
Among those taken down with
typhoid yesterday were two Japa
nese students in Palo Alto. It. G.
Barrett and E. E. Miller are better,
and Pierce Mitchell is improving.
The men in the llall are doing
well.
The following is official:
The report that the University
would close on account of an in
crease in the number of typhoid
cases is unfounded. The situation
has remained practically unchanged
for the past week. The few new
cases that have developed have all
been traced to the common source.
Up to 5 p.m. today (Tuesday)
only one new suspected case has
appeared. No deaths have oc
curred, and there has been a gen
eral improvement during the day
in the cases of all those seriously
ill. The students in the hospital
are all reported today as being in
no immediate danger.
