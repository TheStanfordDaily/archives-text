# "THE CHOIR INVISIBLE."
## Dr. Heber Newton Preached a Strong Sermon in Memorial Church Last Sunday Morning. 
### 
Dr. Newton preached on "The
Choir Invisible" (Immortality of
Influence upon the Earth) Sunday
morning. He proposed this motive
for earnest life, not as a substitute
for the belief in personal immortal
ity, but as a supplement to that
faith where it is in doubt. Death
does not end all for us even here
upon the earth. By every sign of
life, it is plain that the- strong souls
do not die out from the world.
Action as a test of life reveals the
dead in undiminished vitality. The
rulers of men are not found in
palaces, but in tombs. The real
leaders of mankind are the men
who are buried.
The power of growing a body
manifests the same continued vital
ity on the part of the dead. An
institution is the true body of man;
and in the institutions of civiliza
tion the great dead live on among
us.
As the crowning power of being
we see that life can reproduce it
self. Then are the dead still alive
among us. How many artists has
the dead Raphael stirred into life?
How shall we number the intellects
which Shakspere has quickened?
Men are forces; and in the mo
tion they impart to minds and
hearts, these live on in ever widen
ing reach of influence. The queru
lous, miserly, sour old man hiding
away in his wretched garret at
Chelsea was not the true Turner —
but rather he who from the walls
of the National Gallery still stirs
us with his revelations of the
beauty of nature.
This immortality of influence is
not simply for the greatly gifted —
a gospel for the geniuses of earth.
The immortality of usefulness is
within everyone's grasp. Your
papers of canonization are in your
own hands; you can fill them out
with noble lives, and humanity
will sign them, and God himself
will seal them. Even the feebly
forceful do not die. No true and
worthy life wholly fades out upon
the earth. Force is never lost—it
only changes its form. Every life
of sweet-souled sunny goodness, of
patient, earnest service, of honest,
faithful toil for truth, counts for its
full weight in the momentum of
humanity's progress. The little
leaf drops from the stein, but be
ll ind it in the veins the sap flows
somewhat faster, fresher, fuller, for
that dead leaflet's life. Everything
in which we rejoice today, as con
stituting our Christian civilization,
is the work of men and women in
the past, into which they have put
their lives, and in which, blessing
us still, they live on among us in
glorified bodies of laws and letters,
in sublimed energies of hopes and
faiths.
