# The 						New "Chaparral."
## 
### 
The first issue under the new
editorship will appear Thursday.
The particular feature of the num
ber will be a magnificent colored
supplement, probably the finest
thing of the kind, and certainly the
most unique, ever seen at Stanford.
The paper has been enlarged two
pages and especially improved in
art work.
Among the special features will
be "Menecepiialon and the Cosine,"
a three-act farcical squid dedicated
to the Physiology-Engineering de
partments by Waldemar Young,
'04, and a ''Letter from the Son of
a Self-made Merchant to his
Father" by Delmar Reynolds, '05.
There is some good verse in the
issue, notably "Love and Death"
offered for the edification of the
Sequoia. For the first time a Stan
ford organization appears in the
advertising department: the Pro
hibition Club is represented by a
timely full-page ad on the cover.
