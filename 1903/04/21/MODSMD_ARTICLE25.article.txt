# SOPHOMORES VS. FRESHMEN.
## Fifth Annual Interclass Debate Won by Sophomores.â€”Canteen Question. 
### 
The fifth annual Freshinan-
Sophomore debate, held before a
moderately large audience in the
chapel Friday night, resulted in a
unanimous decision for the Sopho
mores. The question for debate
was, "Resolved, That the abolition
of the army canteen was unwise."
Dr. R. M. Alden presided and
Brof. Nathan Abbott and Instruc
tors Burcham and Bassett decided
upon the merits of the discussion.
The Sophomores upheld the aflii nia
tive side of the question, and were
represented by Robert K. Alcott,
Phil I). Swing, and Benjamin C.
Dey. The negative was advocated
for the Freshmen by E. A. Cunha,
J. L. Maloy and Joel Nibley.
Dr. Alden opened the meeting
with a few remarks on the value of
the underclass debate and the rela
tion it bears to the training of men
for the Varsity teams, lie then
introduced R. K. Alcott, who open
ed the case for the affirmative.
Alcott reviewed in a few words the
history of the army canteen, ex
plaining the causes which led to its
establishment. He defined the
position of the affirmative as not
defei ding drinking in the army
but rather claiming that the can
teen was the best means of regu
lating an evil which could not be
suppressed. He then advanced
proofs and statistics to show that
during the operation of the can
teen, drunkenness, desertions, and
trials by court martial as a result
decreased among the soldiers, and
that the morals, efficiency, and
health of the commands im
proved.
E. A. Cunha opened for the neg
ative in a strong speech. He made
no direct attempt to tear down the
argument of the preceding speaker,
but argued against the canteen,
contending that it failed in its
purpose from several standpoints
and that Congress had sufficient
proof of this or else would not have
abolished it.
I'. I). Swing answered in part
the arguments of the negative
speaker, and continued the case for
the affirmative by advancing a

mass of evidence to the effect thai
the abolition of the canteen had
proved to he the cause of increased
drunkenness and desertions and
that the present system had lowered
the morals, health, and efficiency
of the United States troops.
.). L. Maloy argued that the
abolition of the canteen had been a
benefit to the army in health and
morals and that the* rending and
recreation rooms at military posts
would preserve all the desirable fea
tures of the post-exchange and
thereby do away \.ith the canteen
feature and at the same time meet
the drink evil.
B. C. Dey closed the positive
argument for the affirmative. He
brought forward arguments and
facts to refute several of the allega
tions of the negative, and then ad
vanced proof that the same condi
tions of the beneficial effect of the
canteen had proved to be true in
th'e case of the Philippines and
other tropical countries where
United States troops have been
quartered. He closed offering con
siderable evidence to show that the
canteen was the best and only
means of securing temperance in
the army and promoting the wel
fare of I lie soldiers in health, morals
and discipline.
,!oel Nihley ended for the nega
tive by offering much material that
showed some lack of organization,
lie made considerable attempt at
refutation, which was lacking in
ihe other negative speakers.
After a short consultation by the
judges and a few congratulatory
remarks by Professor Abbott the
decision was awarded to the second
year men.
