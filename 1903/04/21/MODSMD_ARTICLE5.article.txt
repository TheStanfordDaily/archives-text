The Training-House Corporation
was incorporated under the laws of
California nearly four years ago.
At that time its purpose was to
raise about $20,000 to be used in
building a training-house at the
University and the laying out of
tracks and athletic grounds. The
erection of the house has since been
provided for, by Mrs. Stanford, in
the plans for the new gymnasium.
The corporation now has between
$4000 and $5000 on hand to be
used in putting the grounds for
athletics in shape. The by-laws or
the corporation provide for a. board
of seven directors to hold office for
life or doing good behaviour. The
board now consists of T. J. Hoover,
'01, chairman, H. H. Taylor, '00,
secretary, J. B. Gildersleeve, '03, J.
E. McDowell, '00, and Mil nor
Roberts, '00. These men will meet
in San Francisco a week from Sat
urday and choose two men from
the six nominated last night to
take the places of Fisher and Cant

resignation of Fisher should have
been filled last spring, and Barn
hisel, Edwards, and Mannon were
nominated by the Executive Com
mittee at that time, but owing to
an error in procedure the directors
of the corporation were unable to
choose Fisher's successor legally,
and the present committee renomi
nated the three men chosen at that
time.
