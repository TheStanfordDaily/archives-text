# Stanford and San Francisco Settlement Work.
## 
### Lucile Eaves, '94 
Lucile Eaves, now in charge of
South Park Settlement, was a history
major while at Stanford, and at one time
held the position of assistant in that de
partment.
The South Park College Settlement in
San Francisco is a center of education,
radiating influences for good through all
the district south of Market street.
Lectures, concerts and clubs with prac
tical aims, are the means employed in
the social work.
The Settlement grew from the inspira
tion given by Jane Adams, who
visited California in 1894, and spoke
several times in San Francisco and at
Stanford and Berkeley, on the work at
Hull House,the American home of college
settlement movement. Stanford was
interested. Dr. Frank Angell served as
first vice-president of the Council, and
the first, list of contributing members
contained the names of seven Stanford
professors. Professor Mary Roberts
Smith, Professor A. (). Lovejoy, and Dr.
T. D. Wood, were among the latter
workers.
Since its organization the Settlement
has been located in South Park, a few
blocks above the Third and Townsend
Rtation, in San Francisco. In 1901 Mrs.
P. A. Hearst gave the beautiful home it
now occupies. Here are quartered eight
resident workers, who, with the excep
tion of the head worker, are voluntary
assistants who pay their own expenses
and give their time and energy to the
Settlement. Among these resident
workers Stanford is represented by
M. M. Kidder, '01.
Other Stanford graduates are active in
this admirable form of social service.
E. C. McLellan, '02, has organized
a club among the young working-women
of the neighborhood. M. Maher, 'ol',
has charge of the Settlement library.
As non-resident workers Katharine
Daly, '01, Rosalie Harris, '01, and May
Harris, '01, have given valuable help.
Carrie Goodhue, ex-'Ol, had charge
of the Oakland Settlement last year, and
Alice Joiner, ex-'O3, worked for sev
eral months at the People's Place, an
other San Francisco Settlement. —En.

When the editors of the Woman's
Edition of The Daily Palo Alto
requested me to contribute this ar
ticle, they suggested that it be "on
what Stanford women are doing in
college settlement work, and how
others can help. " The last half
of the subject seems more worthy
of space. There are many reasons
for hoping that a larger number of
Stanford people may be interested
in the work.
Settlements are being recognized
more and more fully as furnishing
the best medium of expression of
the desire for social service on the
part of those who have received
superior educational advantages.
They had their origin in the work
of Oxford men, who had been in
spired by such teachers as John
Iluskin and Thomas Hill Green,
the apostles of the more modernized
gospel of social service. The move
ment spread rapidly, until at the
present time we find social settle
ments in nearly every large city of
Great Britain and the United
States.
Many of the settlements in this
country are officially connected
with the great universities. Fel
lowships have been endowed for
the support of students in econom
ics and sociology who wish to do
settlement work; and in a number
of instances those in charge of set
tlements serve as non-resident uni
versity lecturers. Some of the
universities have organizations
which cooperate with the settle
ments by securing new members
for their support, and enlisting reg
ular and special workers. Univer
sities comparatively remote from
the great cities, which are generally
considered to be the best fields of
work, have found ways of sharing
in the the settlement activities, and
there is no reason why this should
not be the case at Stanford.
In the first place, it would be
possible to form an organization of
all those interested in settlement
work. Such an organization could
acquaint itself with what is being
done in the California settlements,
and could aid in the support of
particular lines of work. For ex
ample, we need a teacher of domes
tic arts at the South Park Settle
ment. Our cooking-school is fully
equipped, but we have not been
able to raise the funds necessary to
secure a teacher to take charge.
This branch is not only one of the
mo6t useful, but also one of the
most popular lines of work which
the Settlement has undertaken.
Our young women are working as
telephone girls, as clerks or in fac
tories. They rarely know how to
cook and sew, but are eager to
learn. A few weeks ago a little
girl in short skirts came to me af
ter one of the lectures and asked if
she might join " a working-girls'
club." I have been used to hearing
of the"the lady wot scrubs," "the
salesladies' union," and the
l< ladies " that work in the various
factories, —so that the modest self
respect of a request for "a working
girls' club"was an agreeable sur
prise. I made an appoint
ment to discuss what she and her
friends would like to do, if they
had a club. She told me that she
and the girl who worked next her
in the paper-box factory had talked
over things and " made air-castles
about what they would like," and
that they thought it would be
beautiful if they could learn to
cook. Certainly this poor child's
modest air-castle should materialize.
It would not be difficult to raise
enough to maintain such a teacher.
