### A.L. Andrews, ex-,'99 
A. Lillian Andrews entered Stanford
in 1895. In 1902 she went into the
Charity Organization Society of New
York as an investigator in the Registra
tion Bureau, and came to the Associated
Charities of San Francisco, where she
holds the position of Assistant Secretary,
in October of the same year.—Ed.
In California there is an awak
ened interest in the problems of
philanthropy which is bringing
about an increasing demand for
efficient service from those assum
ing the responsibilities of relieving
the poor. To be truly successful,
however, a woman taking up the
work of the Associated Charities
must have a special fitness in tem
perament and in character, as well
as in training. For such a woman
there is a very fair assurance
of success in the work in San Fran
cisco and elsewhere on the Pacific
Coast.
There are several Stanford women
who have already engaged in char
ity organization work. Katherine
Felton, General Secretary of the
Associated Charities of San Fran
cisco, is a graduate of the Univer
sity of California, but she may be
claimed by Stanford as well, for she
registered there in 1897 in graduate
work before she went to the Uni
versity of Chicago, from which she
returned, after doing advanced work
in economics and sociology and
practical work in the Chicago
Bureau of Charities, to the position
of General Secretary of the Associ
ated Charities in Oakland. The
latter position she held for three

years before accepting her present
post in San Francisco.
Mrs. Edith Austin Deveaux, '00,
went into the office of the Charity
Organization Society in New York
City, where she remained about a
year. From there she went to a
position in the Charity Organiza
tion Society of a city of the Middle
West, but her health failed under
the severity of the climate and she
was obliged to give up her work
and return to her home in Wash
ington, where she was afterwards
married.
Martha Madden, ex-'OO, went
from the University to the society
in New York shortly after Mrs.
Deveaux and worked there two
years. In that time she advanced
from the position of Investigator
in the Registration Bureau of
the central office, until at the
time she resigned from her work
to be married she had been assigned
to the statistical work in the cen
tral office.
Mrs. Florence Dorsey Bemis, '98,
began her work only a few months
ago. She went directly from Stan
ford to the position of Assistant
Secretary of the Associated Chari
ties of Oakland.
During the present semester six
of Dr. Moore's students from his
class in Charities and Corrections
in the University of California, are
doing field work from the office of
the Associated Charities in San
Francisco. The use of student as
sistance in the routine of office
work has been bo successful that
the Associated Charities is ready to
afford to one or two university
graduates who wish to enter the
field of philanthropic work the ad
vantage of actual experience.
The only technical school for the
training of those who wish to take
up scientific charities, is the Sum
mer School of Philanthropic Work
conducted by the New York Chari
ty Organization Society, and of
which Professor Mary Roberts
Smith, Mrs. Edith Austin De
veaux, Martha Madden, and Miss
Andrews are graduates. This
school holds six weeks' sessions at
which discussions of the general
problem of the whole field of chari
ties are given with as much practi
cal knowledge as can be gained
from visits to the private and state
institutions of charity. The re
quirements for admission to this
school, with an outline of the work
to be done this summer, are given
in Charities for the current month
(Vol. X, No. 14), published by the
New York Charity Organization
Society, 105 East 22d street, New
York.
As a result of the positive move
ment in San Francisco for higher
standards, the work of the Associat
ed Charities is increasing very rap
idly. The society is a distinct or
ganization which investigates ap
plications for aid and organizes re
lief when that is necessary. It is
not a relief society, but one that
undertakes the work of organizing
the charitable effort of the city
through cooperation. Its object is
to protect the community from the
dangers of pauperization attending
indiscriminate giving; to secure
adequate relief for needy families,
and to cooperate with all legiti
mate charitable effort for better
conditions. For instance, one of
the office staff gave all her time dur
ing the session of the Legislature
towards securing the passage of
three bills, two for the constitution
of a juvenile court and a state
board of charities, and one for a
probation law. Among the results

of the spirit for better work is the
Charities Endorsement Committee,
a joint committee of the Associated
Charities and Merchants' Associa
tion which was formed to protect the
community from fraudulent and
inefficient enterprises, and to set a
standard of efficiency below which
no endorsed charity shall fall. It
is a committee of unsalaried inde
pendent persons whose impartiality
cannot be questioned. It is, in ef
fect, an organized board of public
opinion which issues cards of en
dorsement to charities applying to
it for their public collections. The
Associated Charities is the investi
gating agent for this committee, as
well as for relief societies and
children's homes, from which an
increasing number of requests for
investigations of applications for
the admission and for the adoption
of children are received. As soon
as the probation officers are ap
pointed and receive cases from the
Juvenile Court constituted by an
act of the recent Legislature for the
trial of juvenile delinquents, there
will be added work for the investi
gators of the Associated Charities.
There are two district nurses at
tached to the office of the Associ
ated Charities who minister to the
destitute sick. They work under
physicians who volunteer their ser
vices. In connection with the As
sociated Charities there is not like
ly to be much opportunity in this
branch of the work in the near fu
ture. However, district nursing,
which forms part of the work of the
Associated Charities, is the leading
feature of the settlement of Miss
Briggs at Tehama street.
There is a promise of splendid op
portunity through her work. This
is essentially an opening for Stan
ford women, a movement having
already been started at the Univer
sity to secure the support of a Stan
ford nurse in connection with the
Tehama Street Settlement. Of
course it will be most appropriate
that this nurse should be a Stan
ford graduate who has also quali
fied as a trained nurse.
It is impossible at this stage of
its development to specify what op
portunities will open to those enter
ing the field of charitable work,
therefore the writer has been limit
ed to mere indications of what is
now being done. But to those
whose work justifies advancement
opportunities are certain to come,
although their realization may be
dependent upon several years of
work done at some sacrifice on the
part of the worker.
The work itself, however, repays
for the effort and sacrifice to those
whose interest is of the sort to make
for success.

veaux, Martha Madden, and Miss
Andrews are graduates. This
school holds six weeks' sessions at
which discussions of the general
problem of the whole field of chari
ties are given with as much practi
cal knowledge as can be gained
from visits to the private and state
institutions of charity. The re
quirements for admission to this
school, with an outline of the work
to be done this summer, are given
in Charities for the current month
(Vol. X, No. 14), published by the
New York Charity Organization
Society, 105 East 22d street, New

As a result of the positive move
ment in San Francisco for higher
standards, the work of the Associat
ed Charities is increasing very rap
idly. The society is a distinct or
ganization which investigates ap
plications for aid and organizes re
lief when that is necessary. It is
not a relief society, but one that
undertakes the work of organizing
the charitable effort of the city
through cooperation. Its object is
to protect the community from the
dangers of pauperization attending
indiscriminate giving; to secure
adequate relief for needy families,
and to cooperate with all legiti
mate charitable effort for better
conditions. For instance, one of
the office staff gave all her time dur
ing the session of the Legislature
towards securing the passage of
three bills, two for the constitution
of a juvenile court and a state
board of charities, and one for a
probation law. Among the results

of the spirit for better work is the
Charities Endorsement Committee,
a joint committee of the Associated
Charities and Merchants' Associa
tion which was formed to protect the
community from fraudulent and
inefficient enterprises, and to set a
standard of efficiency below which
no endorsed charity shall fall. It
is a committee of unsalaried inde
pendent persons whose impartiality
cannot be questioned. It is, in ef
fect, an organized board of public
opinion which issues cards of en
dorsement to charities applying to
it for their public collections. The
Associated Charities is the investi
gating agent for this committee, as
well as for relief societies and
children's homes, from which an
increasing number of requests for
investigations of applications for
the admission and for the adoption
of children are received. As soon
as the probation officers are ap
pointed and receive cases from the
Juvenile Court constituted by an
act of the recent Legislature for the
trial of juvenile delinquents, there
will be added work for the investi
gators of the Associated Charities.
There are two district nurses at
tached to the office of the Associ
ated Charities who minister to the
destitute sick. They work under
physicians who volunteer their ser
vices. In connection with the As
sociated Charities there is not like
ly to be much opportunity in this
branch of the work in the near fu
ture. However, district nursing,
which forms part of the work of the
Associated Charities, is the leading
feature of the settlement of Miss
Briggs at Tehama street.
There is a promise of splendid op
portunity through her work. This
is essentially an opening for Stan
ford women, a movement having
already been started at the Univer
sity to secure the support of a Stan
ford nurse in connection with the
Tehama Street Settlement. Of
course it will be most appropriate
that this nurse should be a Stan
ford graduate who has also quali
fied as a trained nurse.
It is impossible at this stage of
its development to specify what op
portunities will open to those enter
ing the field of charitable work,
therefore the writer has been limit
ed to mere indications of what is
now being done. But to those
whose work justifies advancement
opportunities are certain to come,
although their realization may be
dependent upon several years of
work done at some sacrifice on the
part of the worker.
The work itself, however, repays
for the effort and sacrifice to those
whose interest is of the sort to make
for success.
A. Lillian Andrews entered Stanford
in 1895. In 1902 she went into the
Charity Organization Society of New
York as an investigator in the Registra
tion Bureau, and came to the Associated
Charities of San Francisco, where she
holds the position of Assistant Secretary,
in October of the same year.—Ed.
In California there is an awak
ened interest in the problems of
philanthropy which is bringing
about an increasing demand for
efficient service from those assum
ing the responsibilities of relieving
the poor. To be truly successful,
however, a woman taking up the
work of the Associated Charities
must have a special fitness in tem
perament and in character, as well
as in training. For such a woman
there is a very fair assurance
of success in the work in San Fran
cisco and elsewhere on the Pacific
Coast.
There are several Stanford women
who have already engaged in char
ity organization work. Katherine
Felton, General Secretary of the
Associated Charities of San Fran
cisco, is a graduate of the Univer
sity of California, but she may be
claimed by Stanford as well, for she
registered there in 1897 in graduate
work before she went to the Uni
versity of Chicago, from which she
returned, after doing advanced work
in economics and sociology and
practical work in the Chicago
Bureau of Charities, to the position
of General Secretary of the Associ
ated Charities in Oakland. The
latter position she held for three

years before accepting her present
post in San Francisco.
Mrs. Edith Austin Deveaux, '00,
went into the office of the Charity
Organization Society in New York
City, where she remained about a
year. From there she went to a
position in the Charity Organiza
tion Society of a city of the Middle
West, but her health failed under
the severity of the climate and she
was obliged to give up her work
and return to her home in Wash
ington, where she was afterwards
married.
Martha Madden, ex-'OO, went
from the University to the society
in New York shortly after Mrs.
Deveaux and worked there two
years. In that time she advanced
from the position of Investigator
in the Registration Bureau of
the central office, until at the
time she resigned from her work
to be married she had been assigned
to the statistical work in the cen
tral office.
Mrs. Florence Dorsey Bemis, '98,
began her work only a few months
ago. She went directly from Stan
ford to the position of Assistant
Secretary of the Associated Chari
ties of Oakland.
During the present semester six
of Dr. Moore's students from his
class in Charities and Corrections
in the University of California, are
doing field work from the office of
the Associated Charities in San
Francisco. The use of student as
sistance in the routine of office
work has been bo successful that
the Associated Charities is ready to
afford to one or two university
graduates who wish to enter the
field of philanthropic work the ad
vantage of actual experience.
The only technical school for the
training of those who wish to take
up scientific charities, is the Sum
mer School of Philanthropic Work
conducted by the New York Chari
ty Organization Society, and of
which Professor Mary Roberts
Smith, Mrs. Edith Austin De
veaux, Martha Madden, and Miss
Andrews are graduates. This
school holds six weeks' sessions at
