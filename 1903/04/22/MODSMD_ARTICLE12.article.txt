# The 						Self-Supporting Girl at Stanford.

### Kathryn Romer Kip, '04 
Head of the Woman's Employment Bureau.
"What kind of work can a girl
do, to earn her way at Stanford?"
This is the question which meets
me every day, on paper or from
eager lips. My first answer is al
ways "Housework!" and again,
"Housework!" and still "House
work!" For, with a grand and
unswerving inconsistency, the
ladies of the University and vicin
ity join unanimously in two cries,
—the first "How very unsatisfac
tory is student labor!" the second,
"More girls to help us!"
This inconsistency is not so great,
however, as it appears, for amid all
the ignorance and inexperience,
every now and then —aB often as
three or four times a year, perhaps
— a real jewel comes to light,—a girl

who really knows something about
housework, uiid is willing and able
to do it well, feucl: a giil ne\er
lacks for a place—would we had
more of her!
Yes, the first demand in for
housework. This may or may not
mean cooking, it is delightfully
vague, and attempts to reduce it lo
knowledge frequently result in,
"Why, 1 want her to live with us,
and help around, you know!" Ex
perience teaches that these vague
and unassuming employers are the
ones who always have "just one
thing more" to fill in the last four
minutes.
In general, a girl who can cook
well, can get and keep a position
without trouble—one who can and
will do other housework neatly
and satisfactorily comes next, as
there are many calls for girls to
wash dishes, do the daily "picking
up," and so on. We have demands
every year for girls to do the week
ly cleaning, sweeping and scrub
bing, but for this we try to send
men instead of girls. The average
college woman has not strength
enough to wrestle with heavy rugs,
or to move bookstands and pianos.
Next to housework in import
ance comes the care of children.
This usually takes all a girl's after
noons—and varies only in the kind
of child. When both child and
mother are "nice," as the girls say,
it is a very pleasant occupation for
one who has a knack with chil
dren. It is more or less out of
doors, and usually not hard or ex
acting work. It is confining, true,
—and owing to the hours, upually
impossible for "science majors."
Library hours, however, are more
flexible, and if a girl can live on
the campus, near the library, it is
about as easy as anything she can
do.
Besides these, which may be
called the standard occupations,
there are a number of others.
There is a demand, varying with
the season of the year, for girls
who can sew; in fact, an attempt
was made a couple of years ago, to
establish a mending bureau. This
failed, for two reasons: first, too
few girls who could mend; and
second, it was discovered that En
cina men were so expert with their
needles that they did not need to
be mended.
Other occupations are the ever
coveted library work, more or less
teaching or tutoring among college
students or children of the vicinity
(this last, however, is usually ob
tained by students who have made
records in their departments), and
agencies of various kinds—laundry
agents, book agents—even canvas
sing agents for the Sequoia and
"Chappie"—which last employ
ment is by no means the least of
the remunerative jobs! These odd
jobs, however, when worth any
thing, are secured by old students;
indeed, they are frequently spoken
for a year ahead. So the prospec
tive Freshman must plan—unless
she has a stroke of luck—to do
a year's housework or baby tend
ing. The chances are that at the
end of that time she and her em
ployer will have "fitted in" so well
that she will prefer to remain
longer—even all through her col
lege course. It is an interesting fact
that the majority of girls, once
situated in a pleasant home, remain
there at least two years, and the
tendency is for them to become a
part of the family, and to remain
four or five.
Now, how are these positions
obtained? Here is the place of the
Student Employment Bureau.
This organization was started some
seven years ago, under the charge
of the faculty of the University.
Three years ago it was first success
fully placed in the hands of the
Christian Associations as a depart
ment of practical work, being sub
divided into Men's and Women's
Bu reaus.
At this time the call for woman's
labor was comparatively slight, and
the supply even less. The demand
then was almost entirely for house
work, —and as the conditions of
labor were just getting adjusted,
the Bureau was more or less unsat
isfactory. During the past three
years, however, the Women's Em
ployment Bureau has become a
well recognized institution, not only
for housework, but for more aristo
cratic employments. The mem
bers of the faculty and Palo Alto
ladies keep constantly in touch
with it. As heretofore, the demand
remains in advance of the supply —
though both are increasing rapidly.
There is a mad excitement about
it for those in charge of the Bu
reau. All summer the letters of
inquiry from prospective students
pour in—last summer they aver
aged four a week—and we enter
into every September with a long
list of eager applicants, and a trem
ulous fear that this time there may
not be a sufficient demand. There
always is; we have never had a girl
left on our hands by October first—
but the excitement never fails.
Then, the next thing is to get
them adjusted. The first settling
is more or less haphazard. We do
our very best to fit demand with
supply, but in some cases there are
sure to be misfits. During October
and November a vigorous effort is
made to adjust these. Calls are
made on employers, interviews
held with the girls, and sugges
tions, reproofs, and encouragements
poured out lavishly on both. And
if by the first of December we can
look around tranquilly and say
"All's well," we are happy.
During the second semester it is
the health of the girl with which
we concern ourselves. Is she
working too hard? Is her em
ployer demanding too much?
(incidentally is she trying to do too
little?) This burden is as serious
as the question of mutual adapta
bility in the earlier part of the year.
Then the summer work begins
to come in. Girls wish to work,
ladies wish help. This must be
arranged as far as possible by
May 15th, and by that time we
are around to summer again, and
the year's care is over and a new
otie begun.
Now, as a conclusion, the Wo
man's Employment Bureau, on a
basis of experience, wishes to en
courage in seeking to earn a college
education the girl who can and
will do whatever she finds to do,
and do it with her might. She
must be well, strong, able and wil
ling—"No others need apply." But
of this right kind, we want more.
