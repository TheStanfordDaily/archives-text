# The Self-Supporting Girl at Stanford.

"What kind of work can a girl
do, to earn her way at Stanford?"
This is the question which meets
me every day, on paper or from
eager lips. My first answer is al
ways "Housework!" and again,
"Housework!" and still "House
work!" For, with a grand and
unswerving inconsistency, the
ladies of the University and vicin
ity join unanimously in two cries,
—the first "How very unsatisfac
tory is student labor!" the second,
"More girls to help us!"
This inconsistency is not so great,
however, as it appears, for amid all
the ignorance and inexperience,
every now and then —aB often as
three or four times a year, perhaps
— a real jewel comes to light,—a girl

who really knows something about
housework, uiid is willing and able
to do it well, feucl: a giil ne\er
lacks for a place—would we had
more of her!
Yes, the first demand in for
housework. This may or may not
mean cooking, it is delightfully
vague, and attempts to reduce it lo
knowledge frequently result in,
"Why, 1 want her to live with us,
and help around, you know!" Ex
perience teaches that these vague
and unassuming employers are the
ones who always have "just one
thing more" to fill in the last four
minutes.
In general, a girl who can cook
well, can get and keep a position
without trouble—one who can and
will do other housework neatly
and satisfactorily comes next, as
there are many calls for girls to
wash dishes, do the daily "picking
up," and so on. We have demands
every year for girls to do the week
ly cleaning, sweeping and scrub
bing, but for this we try to send
men instead of girls. The average
college woman has not strength
enough to wrestle with heavy rugs,
or to move bookstands and pianos.
Next to housework in import
ance comes the care of children.
This usually takes all a girl's after
noons—and varies only in the kind
of child. When both child and
mother are "nice," as the girls say,
it is a very pleasant occupation for
one who has a knack with chil
dren. It is more or less out of
doors, and usually not hard or ex
acting work. It is confining, true,
—and owing to the hours, upually
impossible for "science majors."
Library hours, however, are more
flexible, and if a girl can live on
the campus, near the library, it is
about as easy as anything she can
do.
Besides these, which may be
called the standard occupations,
there are a number of others.
There is a demand, varying with
the season of the year, for girls
who can sew; in fact, an attempt
was made a couple of years ago, to
establish a mending bureau. This
failed, for two reasons: first, too
few girls who could mend; and
second, it was discovered that En
cina men were so expert with their
needles that they did not need to
be mended.
Other occupations are the ever
coveted library work, more or less
teaching or tutoring among college
students or children of the vicinity
(this last, however, is usually ob
tained by students who have made
records in their departments), and
agencies of various kinds—laundry
agents, book agents—even canvas
sing agents for the Sequoia and
"Chappie"—which last employ
ment is by no means the least of
the remunerative jobs! These odd
jobs, however, when worth any
thing, are secured by old students;
indeed, they are frequently spoken
for a year ahead. So the prospec
tive Freshman must plan—unless
she has a stroke of luck—to do
a year's housework or baby tend
ing. The chances are that at the
end of that time she and her em
ployer will have "fitted in" so well
that she will prefer to remain
longer—even all through her col
lege course. It is an interesting fact
that the majority of girls, once
situated in a pleasant home, remain
there at least two years, and the
tendency is for them to become a
part of the family, and to remain
four or five.
Now, how are these positions
