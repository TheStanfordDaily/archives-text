# GIRLS FROM OTHER UNIVERSITIES
## 
### 
The most cosmopolitan institu
tion on the Coast is Stanford Uni
versity. Mrs. Stanford, in speak
ing of the women who are being

educated here,
said:
" I am often
asked why so
m any girls
come to Stan
ford. I answer
that I suppose
it is because

they are by nature aesthetic and ap
preciate beauty. There is a poetry
and romance about Stanford and its
Quad that attracts. Another reason,
I believe, is because as a rule the de
meanor of Stanford men is chival
rous — exceptionally so. We are
proud of that."
It is somewhat of a surprise in
looking up the matter to find that
during the present semester there
are enrolled at Stanford women
with advanced standing from so
many different colleges and univer
sities. The Slate universities of
Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Cali
fornia, lowa, Nevada, Montana,
Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, Ne
braska, and Wisconsin are all
represented. Besides these, there
are women from the universities of
Chicago, Denver, Southern Cali
fornia, Cornell, Northwestern and
Ottawa (Kas.); and from Wellesley,
Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Hiram, Po
mona, Fair mount, Hillsdale (Mich.)
lowa, Montana State, Mills, Occi
dental, Cornell (la.), Simpson,
Buchtel (Ohio), Woman's (Balti
more), Wheaton and Milwaukee-
Downer colleges.
Many of these institutions have
been established for years and are
rich in the traditions and customs
which Stanford lacks. About the
only feature peculiar to Stanford
women is the wearing of caps and
gowns by the seniors during the
last half of the second semester.
This year the senior table is to be
introduced at Roble and all gradu
ating girls will eat at the same
table throughout May.
To the end that we may become
more familiar with traditions from
sister institutions, girls from other
universities have been invited to
write up their customs. The re
sults are interesting and sugges
tive.
Wisconsin.
At the University of Wisconsin
the life of the women is so thor
oughly identified with the general
life of the institution that there are
few customs peculiar to the women
except the activities of the Self-
Government Association, of which
all women students are members.
The "S. G. A.," as it is known,
regulates the social life of the uni
versity, making the rules which at
Stanford are made by the faculty
committee. It also aims to give
all the women a common bond and
feeling of comradeship. For this
purpose, every year there are four
parties in the women's gymnasium
which all the women attend and '
all enjoy thoroughly. Two of these
parties are fancy dress affairs held
on Hallowe'en and Washing
ton's Birthday. At these usually
a play is presented, followed by
dancing, when the girls make a
point of choosing for partners girls
of whom they see little ordi
narily.

Faculty Night at Wellesley.
"Faculty Night" is awaited with
glee at Wellesley. The barn is
sure to be crowded on that particu
lar Saturday evening, and pleasant
shivers of anticipation run up and
down the back of the waiting au
dience, as it hazards a wager on
the special form of entertainment
to be "sprung." For this one fea
ture of the night is unchanging—
there is always a surprise. On its
being so, hangs the faculty's repu
tation of being able to keep a se
cret. It is known weeks beforehand
that the faculty is "on"—that it
holds mysterious weekly conven
tions at unexpected hours, in un
suspected places. But Faculty
Night always scores its triumph of
novelty. Once it was a district
school where the professor of aes
thetics, in pinafore and pigtails,
chewed tutti fruitti gum, under her
seat, and the professor of Biblical
lore told a lie and didn't repent.
But the matchless night was that
which brought out the "Grand,
Sumptuous and Titanic Spectacular
Symphony Concertwhen the
curtain rose on an assembly of
musicians whose varied nationality
was indicated by costume effects.
There were one or two violins, a
cornet or so, and the piano, to
carry the "melody." The music,
by the way, was an adaptation of
a bona-fide orchestral score. But
as accessory to these, what strange
instruments were there! Police
man's rattles, pop-guns, whistling
birds (they were beautiful in the
forest motif), seven styles of drum,
the kind of balloon that blows up
quietly and dies with a swan song,
bones, shuttles, tambourines, tri
angles —oh, the varietyman was
an inspiring sight in her extraordi
nary feat of playing three different
instruments and changing to three
more while keeping the sound go
ing! It was an evening of delight
ing discords and melodizing mirth
—a peerless performance.

At Chicago.
A pretty little custom which is
popular with the girls of one of the
dormitories at the University of
Chicago, is that of entertaining the
children of the faculty one after
noon of each May. It is spoken of
as the Baby Party, for only chil
dren under seven years old are
asked. The girls outdo themselves
in making elaborate paper caps to
crown their guests, and in collect
ing toys for them to carry away as
souvenirs of their debut into society.
After the children have all arrived,
they march in solemn procession
(so many smiling hostesses and
the unusual air of festivity have a
tendency to awe them) to the big
dining-room where they are seated
around long, low tables. Those
who are old enough blow soap
bubbles, and those who are too lit
tle to share in this exhilarating
pastime look on from the vantage
ground of mothers' or nurses' laps.
And presently before each baby is
set a wonderful Brownie of pink
and white ice-cream, planked by a
whole menagerie of animal crackers.
Supper is the last of the day's sur
prises, and when it is over the ex
cited little guests take leave of very
reluctant hostesses.

Denver Girls.
A visitor at the daily chapel ser
vice of the University of Denver
would be certain to have his atten
tion attracted the first thing to Ihe
rows and rows of black capped
girls sitting quite by themselves,
Quaker fashion, on the right-hand
side of the room. To his unaccus
tomed eye, these tasseled academic
mortar-boards would probably all
look alike, but the resident knows
that there is four-fold variety there,
and can tell the year of each girl
by her tassel.
The freshman wears hers dang
ling in the direction of her right
eye, the sophomore tosses hers co
quettishly over her right shoulder,
the junior moves hers on to the
next side of the square toward her
left shoulder, and the senior has
only to cast her eyes upward to the
left to be reminded that her tassel
is in proud fourth-year position.
The girl who receives her degree,
exchanges her four-year-old black
tassel for a white silk one.

Minnesota.—The Senior Spread.
It is a warm, sunny afternoon in
mid-May—for warm days do come,
even in frozen Minnesota. There
is much rustling of skirts, and
rattling of dishes in and around
the big room, which all Y. W.
C. A. girls call home. Down the
center of the room stretches a long
table around which hovers a group
of girls putting the last touches to
flowers, souvenirs, programs, and
decorations. For this is one of the
ways in which the girls of Minne
sota express, every spring, their
feeling of good-will for their de
parting senior friends —it is the
"Senior Spread," and at it all
senior girls must appear in the full
glory of cap and gown.
Most of the lowerclass-women
sit humbly below the salt, that
is, against the walls. Others
still more self-sacrificing, wait
at table, and when the toasts
have all been given and the songs
have all been sung, each senior girl
goes away with a certain sense of
good-fellowship and cordiality to
warm her heart.

Class Day at Northwestern.
Class Day at Northwestern comes
during senior week in June. It is
a day of frolic for all the girls, but
freshmen enjoy themselves most.
This is really their farewell to first
year irresponsibility, for after Class
Day they consider themselves sopho
mores. Tradition allows them to
lay aside for this once all the dig
nity they may have gained during
their first eventful year in college,
and to appear on the lawn in front
of Willard Hall dressed as chil
dren. With short skirts and hair
braided down the back, they go
hand in hand over to the campus
where the other classes are assem
bled for the day's exercises. Un
der the large shade trees on the
lake shore they play all the chil
dren's games they know : hide-and
seek, hop-scotch, drop the-hand
kerchief, and, best of all, tag. Pea
nuts, popcorn, and candy form the
refreshments, and the day is ended
with a snap-shot of "the children,"
which serves as a souvenir.

Mt. Holyoke Class Privileges.
Seniors) at Mt. Holyoke have
two distinctive privileges,—that of
occupying the steps of Williston
Hall when the girls gather on the
campus to sing, and that of jump
ing rope. The latter is observed
on the afternoon of May Day. It
is an interesting moment when the
long double line of sedate, capped
and gowned seniors, carrying new
ropes, comes up the walk from the
gym and forms a circle about the
big walnut tree in front of Willis
ton. After the class yell has been
chanted, the girls separate and the
skipping begins. The gayety does
not cease until the dinner bell rings;
then the ropes are taken home and
hung up as mementoes.
On the following day it is the
turn of the juniors to occupy col
lege attention by going to the gym
and spinning tops. The main dif
ference between the two ceremonies
is that the ropes never appear be
forehand, while the tops are dis
played everywhere for at least a
week previous to the great day.

Pomona.
When the new Pomona girl en
ters her room in Sumner Hall on
a hot September day she finds a
bunch of flowers on her dresser
with greetings from the old girls.
The first night freshmen and little
preps go to a spread where they
forget their homesickness while try
ing to eat jelly before it runs off the
cracker and listening to tales of
former days.
The crowning social event of the
girls' year is the Dove Ball. This
used to be given in the dining
room of Sumner Hall with curtains
carefully drawn. This year they
danced in the gym with music by
the college orchestra.

The Donning of the Pin.
At Milwaukee-Downer College,
the freshmen have an annual ban
quet at which the class pin is for
mally assumed. This comes early
in the year. The class officer, a
patron saint selected from the
faculty to guard the freshmen
through the year, presides and acts
as toast-mistress. The toasts are
many and witty, and the class song
is sung,—in my year it was "We
are a Noble Working Band," to the
tune of "There is a Tavern in the
Town.'' This class was said to be
the most conceited one in col
lege because our motto was taken,
not altogether seriously, from Kip
ling, "There's Only One Corps
That's Perfect —That's Us." This
was given fervently in unison dur
ing the banquet.
Finally comes the toast of the
evening, "The Pins," and at the
close of the response the class dons
its emblem. The festivities always
conclude by a rush from the sopho
mores, who swoop down upon the
tables like birds of prey, and I sup
pose we would have felt slighted if
they had stayed away.
