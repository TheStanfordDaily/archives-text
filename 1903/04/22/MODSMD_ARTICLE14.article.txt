# Cornell " Stunts."
## 
### 
The college life of the Cornell
girls in centered in the large dormi
tory, Snge HalJ, where tlie greater
part of the women of the university,
including the sororities, live. There
all the various activities, social and
otherwise, are originated and car
ried out.
Perhaps the most firmly fixed
custom among the Cornell girls is
the class "stunt." Each class in
turn, beginning with the seniors,
entertains all the women of the
university. There is, of course, a
good deal of rivalry between the
classes as to which shall produce
the most unique and successful
program, and it may vary from a
May-day party to light opera or an
original farce.
One particularly good stunt was a
burlesque of a country fair, carried
out with great attention to details.
Most of the side shows and exhibits
were amusing grindson the faculty.
Occasionally an ambitious class
will attempt Shakspere, — Mid
summer Night's Dream was played
by the juniors two years ago —but
less pretentious efforts are the rule
and meet with greater success.
