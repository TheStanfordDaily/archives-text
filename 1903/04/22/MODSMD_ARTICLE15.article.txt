# Stanford Women in the Ranks of Literature.
## 
### Anna Strunsky, ex-'00 
Anna Strunsky, ex-'OO, even before
she entered Stanford had gained con
siderable reputation as a writer and
speaker,especially upon socialistic topics.
While here she was prominent in de
bating, being the only woman who ever
represented this University upon a
Carnot team. Since leaving, Miss
Strunsky has devoted herself wholly to
literature and lecture work. In colla
boration with Jack London she has re
cently finished "The Kempthorn-Wace
Letters." The book is a discussion on
love, the purely romantic and the prac
tical; it takes the form of letters be
tween Dane Kenipthorn, an English
poet, and Herbert Wace, who is a foster
son of Kenipthorn and a young profes
sor at our State University. Macmillan
and Company will bring this book out
next month. Miss Strunsky is now in
New York, engaged on a novel which
she hopes to finish this summer. —E».
The list of Stanford women who
have successfully undertaken liter
ary work is not formidable, but
neither is it discouraging. Edith
M. Thomas, whose poems have for
the last several years been appear
ing in the best magazines, and
whose book of collected poems has
been cordially greeted, is a one-time
Stanford student of the English de
partment. Katherine Chandler,
History, '00, now in New York,
has turned her fund of historic
data to artistic account. Her
stories, teeming with the romance
of early Spanish life in California,
have been found "available'' by
large dailies and magazines. Sarah
Comstock, '96, has won her spurs
in newspaper work. Laura Smith
Greer has written some interesting
verse in the spirit of Whitman.
Of those who have published books
are Genevra Sisson, now Mrs.
Snedden, and Mrs. Margaret Hood.
Mrs. Wallace Irwin (Grace Luce,
ex-'95) is the sole book-reviewer for
the Overland Monthly. Doubtless
there are other women who belong
to Stanford —by birth as well as
by education, one is tempted to
say —who have done and are doing
literary work.
Art is long. It demands an un
ending service,and it yields a tardy
reward, —at least from the stand
point of the onlooker. And Stan
ford University has been open but
a moment of time. How many
women whose steps have measured
the Quadrangle may, at the pres
ent moment, be fighting the gallant
fight for power to state the fact and
sing the song!
For the undertaking to do some
thing permanent with one's life
— and that is what work in liter
ature means, —is a thing of splen
did seriousness, a purpose which
makes the day vibrant and the
night scintillant. In the night
the would-be maker of books is
held by the lure of the Idea, the
face of it leans close and warm on
his cheek, and the lips fold down
kisses like roses on his; in the day
he is driven to fix its suffused
beauty, to catch up the witchery,
to make tangible the wonder, and
thus, through nights of rapture
and days that are haunted, the
spirit of the artist fights its
way to the goal. There must not
be too much hurry, lest something
be lost. Decidedly, the Stanford
women cannot have had time
enough 1 They cannot have lived
enough, seen enough, dreamed
enough, sobbed and laughed
enough, —but bide a wee!
To "bide a wee" is characteristic
of the Californian. He likes to
have the sun and wind temper his
inspiration. He plays hide and
seek for a long while with his plans
and hopes. If the manuscript be

not ready by Christmas, it will be
by the Christmas after, and what
does it matter? His work is fresh
and strong when it becomes work,
the note struck is always vital, but
he is leisurely in girding up the
loin and trimming the lamp. He
feels he can afford to take a long
time growing up, and his powers
mature in inverse ratio to his
body.
At Stanford the winds of free
dom blow (we were told and we
would fain believe). The tints of
the intellectual life areas variegat
ed and as speaking as the emblaz
oned clouds that hang at sunset
over the purple hills. The Quad
rangle is wrapped in the quiet of
the cloister. The University is so
removed, so West of the West, so
self-contained! With the quiet
there is also the rampant strength
of new forces. The entering stu
dent is caught up by the strange
ness of it all, and the charm. Im
pressions begin to crowd in, voices
to call, hopes to cling. A hand
reaches out of the new world and
lays itself on his brow. It may be
long before the promise is made
good, but meanwhile there is no
dearth of friends to ferret out the
secret possibility, to hail it and be
lieve in it. At Stanford no one
laughs at the aspirant, everybody
encourages; so there is no need of
bugging the hope to one's self in an
anguish of secrecy. Men and
women here woo ideas with the
beautiful openness of the courtships
in "News from Nowhere." Frank
ness never stunts and is best al
ways.
Stanford women in the fieid of
literature—why not? It is "eleven
fifteen" Monday morning in room
25 at Stanford, and a teacher
who is truly a teacher is read
ing Milton, in a memorable way.
Only a few seats in the back
of the room are occupied by men, —
the class is one of women. Who
shall say that of the hundreds of
women who throng the English de
partment year by year, there are
not some who have it in them to
make best return for the teaching?
And when that return is made it
will be "marked broad with her
mark," instinct with the mystery
and the promise in the eyes of our
Alma Mater.
