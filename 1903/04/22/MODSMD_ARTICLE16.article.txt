### Sarah Comstock 
Surah Comstock, '96, registered at
Stanford from Kansas City, Missouri,
and under the nom-de-plume " Sarac"
was a prominent contributor to Stan
ford publications, as well as associate
editor of the Sequoia and the '9(1 Quad,
and author of the '96 Junior Farce.
Miss Comstock is now on the San Fran
cisco Call, and in the following article
gives a glim pse of real newspaper life.-Ed.
For instance, on Monday you
have a society detail. You put on
the smartest tailored gown, the hat
with the fluttering window-curtain
acquisition, the boa that billows,
and you call. Your editor long
ago told you when you appeared
in San Francisco beneath a home
crocheted tam-o'-shanter that if
you were ever to make a society
reporter you must dreßs the part.
Monday you are the society
woman chatting with the society
woman, for it is only by being one
with her that you are going to suc
ceed in winning a heart-to-heart
on the subject of her newest gowns
that she has brought back from
Paris, and eventually, if the gods
smile, getting permission to photo
graph those gowns for a smashing
Sunday page. You knock wood if
the thought dare occur to you that

she might even consent to pose iji
the gowns herself instead of drap
ing them on the form of some
actress. Of course a thousand
Paris fashions are published every
Sunday,—there is nothing in the
mere picture of a gown. But if
you can authoritatively say, "These
are the gowns lately brought from
Paris by Mrs. Van Rensselaer, the
ones which will appear this season
at the functions of the smart set,"
Mrs. Van Rensselaer being promi
nent in that set and known to
everybody in San Francisco —then
count another feather for your cap.
One of your first lessons was,"The
name carries." That means that
pictures of the most stunning
gowns which belonged to a mere
Mrs. Smith, unknown, would be of
little or no value, but pictures of
any old wrapper which Mrs. Van
Rensselaer might inhabit would
cause you to count still another
pay-day milestone on your career.
Monday night you lay aside the
costume. Whether you lay aside
the anxiety or not depends upon
how long you have been in the
business. Mrs. Van Rensselaer
will talk it over with Mr. Van
Rensselaer and leave it to him
whether she shall pose. She would
not like to do it without his con
sent. You have met the gentle
man in question and recall his
opinion that "this thing of news
paper notoriety is all tommyrot."
Not until tomorrow will you know
whether you have fallen down or
not. In either case there is no use
reporting all the arguing and coax
ing you have used, all the labor of
wits and wiles. To the paper,
"you either get it or you don't get
it,"for the paper is very much
like life.
When you laid aside the costume
you laid aside the role as well, for
Tuesday brings a new drama. It
happens to be of a Russian social
ist this time, an escaped exile from
Siberia who is skulking in a few
miserable rooms in a dingy quarter,
trying to make both ends meet for
himself and his family by taking in
piece-work from a tailor. Three
snarling dogs rush, snapping, to
meet you, for an}' stranger may
mean an agent of the Government.
It takes much ingenuity to gain
entrance and more to gain confi
dence. When the man is assured
that the paper is looking for a story
of Siberia and is not trying to give
him away to his octopus of a Gov
ernment, he talks. You hear anec
dotes of the prison. You hear of
the sick woman prisoner who died
after fifty lashes, of the men who
live out their terms chained to
wheelbarrows, of the frequent cases
of insanity that end prison service.
You see the scraps of memoirs
written on cigarette paper, the only
paper permitted. Then you are
told of the poison that was lately
discovered in the food after a newly
made friend had been dining in
the exile's rooms, and oi the mys
terious prowler who is disturbing
the family every night, and you
begin to see what it means to be
a Damocles.
Wednesday, perhaps, brings you
into the midst of woman's clubs.
You have to look sympathetic,
even though you haven't the least
desire to vote, believing that you
have troubles enough as it is. In
the early evening you drop in at
the Van Rensselaer's and try to
coax the lord and master to recon
sider his heartless decision. You
have long since learned the time to
attack a man. It is not necessary
to be married — newspaper life

teaches you just as well the potency
of the after-dinner hour.
Thursday brings a fashion story
—you know there are no "articles,"
only "stories" in the newspaper
world. You were rash enough the
other day to propose a page of
babies' fashions as a novelty, and
you have lived to repent. It is up
to you to find a baby and pose it.
You have searched in vain for a
fond parent who was willing, and
at last you have induced one of the
nurses to bring a model from gin
Infants' Shelter. The garments
arrive from a shop, the baby ar
rives, you meet them all at the
photograph gallery. Then comes
the task of dressing the squirming
model in each outfit and overseeing
its photographing in each, while the
nurse assists with much trotting and
cooing, and tears are imminent.
You are to spend Friday night
at the Presidio Hospital, and you
plan trustfully to rest during the
day by way of preparation. But
the morning brings an unexpected
telephone message from your editor.
You go to the 'phone in a bathrobe,
for owls have to sleep o' mornings.
It is an Oakland detail and it is a
rush. You bolt a cold roll and
hurry for the boat. You find the
detail a pillar to post affair. No
body knows the thing that you
must learn but everybody knows
who does. You go from end to end
of the town, and after long hours it
occurs to you that your knees are
inclined to wobble. Then you look
at your watch. Five o'clock and
you have not yet breakfasted.
You will have time to get home,
have a nameless meal, and snatch
a cat-nap before it iB necessary to
go to the Presidio. The night
nurses go on duty in the early
evening, but the dead of night do
ings are what you want for the
thrill of the story. It is a nerve
racking night. You visit every
ward, you watch with the watchers,
you hear the mutterings of the de
lirious and the moans of the dying.
When the creeping mist of the dawn
comes it shows you ghosts. You
will not forget that night. You
want to go home and sleep it off.
For the moment you forgot.
Mascagni had said, "Come at
twelve-thirty." Another cat-nap
and then the hotel apartment and a
burst of delightful Italian that you
are compelled by the sheer magnet
ism of the man to understand.
During the evenings of the week
you have been rattling off on your
typewriter the stories for which
you gathered material during the
days. Sunday finds you brain
and body-weary* and you thank
Providence for a couch, cushions,
and a novel.
And the queer thing about it all
is that you are eager for the new
detail when it comes Monday again.
For you love the life. The news
papermen and -women are specta
tors at a wonderful shifting drama,
and anyone, from the President of
the United States to a Tehama
street newsboy may be the next
actor to appear, and the play is
the only one that never grows tire
some, for it is life.
When you left the University
for the newspaper world you
thought it was going to be a liter
ary life. It is not. But it is the
greatest school for a literary life
that exists, for there is no school
that can offer any such course in
human nature. And with all that
you see you are not going to turn
cynic, for the ideals that your Alma
Mater developed in you are a safe
guard that is bound to last.

Surah Comstock, '96, registered at
Stanford from Kansas City, Missouri,
and under the nom-de-plume " Sarac"
was a prominent contributor to Stan
ford publications, as well as associate
editor of the Sequoia and the '9(1 Quad,
and author of the '96 Junior Farce.
Miss Comstock is now on the San Fran
cisco Call, and in the following article
gives a glim pse of real newspaper life.-Ed.
For instance, on Monday you
have a society detail. You put on
the smartest tailored gown, the hat
with the fluttering window-curtain
acquisition, the boa that billows,
and you call. Your editor long
ago told you when you appeared
in San Francisco beneath a home
crocheted tam-o'-shanter that if
you were ever to make a society
reporter you must dreßs the part.
Monday you are the society
woman chatting with the society
woman, for it is only by being one
with her that you are going to suc
ceed in winning a heart-to-heart
on the subject of her newest gowns
that she has brought back from
Paris, and eventually, if the gods
smile, getting permission to photo
graph those gowns for a smashing
Sunday page. You knock wood if
the thought dare occur to you that

she might even consent to pose iji
the gowns herself instead of drap
ing them on the form of some
actress. Of course a thousand
Paris fashions are published every
Sunday,—there is nothing in the
mere picture of a gown. But if
you can authoritatively say, "These
are the gowns lately brought from
Paris by Mrs. Van Rensselaer, the
ones which will appear this season
at the functions of the smart set,"
Mrs. Van Rensselaer being promi
nent in that set and known to
everybody in San Francisco —then
count another feather for your cap.
One of your first lessons was,"The
name carries." That means that
pictures of the most stunning
gowns which belonged to a mere
Mrs. Smith, unknown, would be of
little or no value, but pictures of
any old wrapper which Mrs. Van
Rensselaer might inhabit would
cause you to count still another
pay-day milestone on your career.
Monday night you lay aside the
costume. Whether you lay aside
the anxiety or not depends upon
how long you have been in the
business. Mrs. Van Rensselaer
will talk it over with Mr. Van
Rensselaer and leave it to him
whether she shall pose. She would
not like to do it without his con
sent. You have met the gentle
man in question and recall his
opinion that "this thing of news
paper notoriety is all tommyrot."
Not until tomorrow will you know
whether you have fallen down or
not. In either case there is no use
reporting all the arguing and coax
ing you have used, all the labor of
wits and wiles. To the paper,
"you either get it or you don't get
it,"for the paper is very much
like life.
When you laid aside the costume
you laid aside the role as well, for
Tuesday brings a new drama. It
happens to be of a Russian social
ist this time, an escaped exile from
Siberia who is skulking in a few
miserable rooms in a dingy quarter,
trying to make both ends meet for
himself and his family by taking in
piece-work from a tailor. Three
snarling dogs rush, snapping, to
meet you, for an}' stranger may
mean an agent of the Government.
It takes much ingenuity to gain
entrance and more to gain confi
dence. When the man is assured
that the paper is looking for a story
of Siberia and is not trying to give
him away to his octopus of a Gov
ernment, he talks. You hear anec
dotes of the prison. You hear of
the sick woman prisoner who died
after fifty lashes, of the men who
live out their terms chained to
wheelbarrows, of the frequent cases
of insanity that end prison service.
You see the scraps of memoirs
written on cigarette paper, the only
paper permitted. Then you are
told of the poison that was lately
discovered in the food after a newly
made friend had been dining in
the exile's rooms, and oi the mys
terious prowler who is disturbing
the family every night, and you
begin to see what it means to be
a Damocles.
Wednesday, perhaps, brings you
into the midst of woman's clubs.
You have to look sympathetic,
even though you haven't the least
desire to vote, believing that you
have troubles enough as it is. In
the early evening you drop in at
the Van Rensselaer's and try to
coax the lord and master to recon
sider his heartless decision. You
have long since learned the time to
attack a man. It is not necessary
to be married — newspaper life

teaches you just as well the potency
of the after-dinner hour.
Thursday brings a fashion story
—you know there are no "articles,"
only "stories" in the newspaper
world. You were rash enough the
other day to propose a page of
babies' fashions as a novelty, and
you have lived to repent. It is up
to you to find a baby and pose it.
You have searched in vain for a
fond parent who was willing, and
at last you have induced one of the
nurses to bring a model from gin
Infants' Shelter. The garments
arrive from a shop, the baby ar
rives, you meet them all at the
photograph gallery. Then comes
the task of dressing the squirming
model in each outfit and overseeing
its photographing in each, while the
nurse assists with much trotting and
cooing, and tears are imminent.
You are to spend Friday night
at the Presidio Hospital, and you
plan trustfully to rest during the
day by way of preparation. But
the morning brings an unexpected
telephone message from your editor.
You go to the 'phone in a bathrobe,
for owls have to sleep o' mornings.
It is an Oakland detail and it is a
rush. You bolt a cold roll and
hurry for the boat. You find the
detail a pillar to post affair. No
body knows the thing that you
must learn but everybody knows
who does. You go from end to end
of the town, and after long hours it
occurs to you that your knees are
inclined to wobble. Then you look
at your watch. Five o'clock and
you have not yet breakfasted.
You will have time to get home,
have a nameless meal, and snatch
a cat-nap before it iB necessary to
go to the Presidio. The night
nurses go on duty in the early
evening, but the dead of night do
ings are what you want for the
thrill of the story. It is a nerve
racking night. You visit every
ward, you watch with the watchers,
you hear the mutterings of the de
lirious and the moans of the dying.
When the creeping mist of the dawn
comes it shows you ghosts. You
will not forget that night. You
want to go home and sleep it off.
For the moment you forgot.
