# The
						Woman's League.
## 
### 
The Woman's League was organ
ized during the spring semes
ter of 1901-1902, under the
leadership of Mrs. Jordan. The
motive in forming such an
organization was to bring the
women of the University into closer
social contact. Officers were elect
ed and a directing board appointed.
Theresa Wilbur, '03, was the first
president. Encouraged by the
hearty cooperation and support of
the women of the University, the
League soon took its place among
Stanford organizations, and has
become a recognized factor in
women's affairs.
It seeks to be thoroughly repre
sentative of all Stanford women,
and to be a staunch supporter of
all their worthy undertakings. It
endeavors to bring before them
speakers particularly interested in
various lines of work for women.
Membership is restricted to
women students, faculty ladies,
and those ladies residing here
whose names are favorably acted
upon by a membership committee.
A very small assessment is levied
upon members to defray expenses
of the social meetings, which are
held on the fourth Friday after
noon of each month in the parlors
of Roble Hall, where light refresh
ments are served. The League
supplies a long-felt want in the
University community, and de
serves the earnest support of those
whom it serves.
Elizabeth Peckham, '03,
President.
