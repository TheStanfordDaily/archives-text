# The 						Social Situation at Stanford.
## 
### S. L 
Stanford women are talking. The
significance of that fact is not ap
parent until it is remarked that they
are verging towards a unanimous
opinion. The expression of this
opinion is as yet so light that you
hear it as a whisper merely upon
the Row; at Roble it swells to a
rumor, and floats away through
Palo Alto into the great world.
That the opinion exists is signifi
cant. Expressed ever so lightly,
it demands recognition.
Stanford woman are beginning
to realize that the world demands
of them as college women more
than they are able to give. They
are beginning to see that it is not
enough for a girl to go out from
her University equipped with vol
uminous notes on "Household Eco
nomics" and reams of papers on

"The Nature of the Ego." It is not
even enough that in addition she
be satisfied of the true meaning
of friendship and able to serve
coffee noir or au la it. More is de
manded. The Stanford girl recog
nizes that it is not an unreasonable
demand, and vet —she is not equal
to (he occasion. She graduates
wiser, after thorough instruction
and conscientious study through
these four years; she has respect for
the opinions of other people, and a
just confidence in her own; perhaps
she has greater ease of manner in
conversation and deportment; cer
tainly she has her liberal share of
college spirit. But when she comes
to assume her place as daughter
in her father's house, as hostess
in her mother's home, as a guest of
her friends, as a neighbor in her
town, as mistress of her own house
hold, there arise situations with
which she cannot cope; there are
times when note-book and essay,

and the diploma itself, fall short in
llieir advice.
Invariably, the world, rightly or
wrongly, demands of the college
woman a criterion of action. She
must he able to set it. Just as the
world exacts of the college man that
he shall a little more than hold his
own in business circles, so it looks
to the college woman for leadership
and savoir-faire in all circles. How
and when she acquire the ability
to lead and do, is left to her, but
have it she must.

Since it is a thing
that can be mas
tered only by prac
tise, opportunity
to so attain it
should be afforded
her. Since that
she have it is de
manded of her be
cause she is a col
lege woman, that
op p ortu nity
should be given
her by her college.

The Stanford girl must have
social training. In other words,
she must adapt herself to certain
recognized standards. This is no
plea for the imposition of arbitrary
rules to regulate social conditions
at Stanford, but rather it is a plea
for the voluntary adoption of some
common course of action which
shall bring together the women of
this University in a common cause.
It is not the fault of any individual
nor any association of individuals
that the society of Stanford is in a
wholly disintegrated state. It is-the
fault or the lack of a policy. There
is no code of conduct. There is too
much laixticr-fairf. It is experi
menting, which promises to end in
nothing but experimenting, and
meanwhile nobody reaps the bene
fit of it all.
Kirst of all, the Stanford girl
must acquire a sense of oneness

with the community in which she
comes to live —with all the obliga
tions which that entails. Let her
by all means develop her individu
ality, but only to merge it in the
general unity. As matters stand
now, the Stanford girl comes in
an enthusiastic, independent, holi
est school girl; and she goes out
little more. She has indeed lost
none of her natural excellences; she
is presumably strenghtened in
them, —but her acquirement is not
in proportion. She has no sense
of social obligation, of forgetful
ness of self in a common pur
pose. How can she have, when
she goes through her four years
with personal welfare as her chief
aim? She lives not as a part of
a whole, but as one, among five
hundred ones, each struggling for
place. She is bound by no re
strictions save those of her own
conscience. She is jealous of her
"liberty," and likes to feel that

conventionalities do not restrain
her. But afterwards?
Even before she is graduated,
humiliating experiences during va
cation open her eyes to something
wanted. Book-lore alone does not
answer. The need is imperative
when an "upperclass-woman" cries
out in abnegation of spirit: "If
only there were offered at Stanford
a course in genuine good-breeding!"
What that girl longed for was not
more receptions,—which too often

are a mockery of
true social inter
course, and a shal
low form we hold
to from sheer lack
of courage to let
go; not more halls,
— most of which
we attend merely
to publicly dem
onstrate that we
have been invit
ed ; not even more
"spreads,"- which
are apt to degen-

erate into mere "feeds." What she
wanted was real social experience,
to prepare her to go into the world
a woman educated in the fullest
sense of the word.
That there have been attempts
to realize here the very thing she
wanted is evidenced by the form
ing of the "Woman's League."
That an association for the con
sumption of tea and toast is not
what Stanford needs, is equally
evinced by what that League has
failed to do. At lirst it seemed in
a fair way to accomplish its an
nounced objects, which were cer
tainly good. Now the very women
who still stand most loyally to its
support admit to themselves that
the League falls short of its aim.
Why not acknowledge it openly
ami try again?
But first we must admit without
reserve that we are not getting

from our University life all that
we have a right to demand. We
must talk about it, —turn rumor
into discussion, discover why we
are different from what we would
he, and acknowledge our failings
as well as our virtues. If need he,
let us imitate. Why should we be
averse to profit by the experience of
sister universities? If they have
anything we want let ns take it,
that we in turn may have some
thing to give. Much toward the
realization of an ideal will have
been accomplished when we suc
ceed in consolidating the social in
terests of Stanford women, liut
how is that to be done? Other
colleges have met and mastered the
problem. Why not look abroad
for advice, and then let Stanford
women meet Stanford wants?
These shortcomings of ours are
not things to be gossiped of in
whispers; they are things to be
made manifest, among ourselves,
and remedied. Let us have the
criticism and guidanceof the"faculty
women." It is easy to see what
is wanting, but we need experience
to tell us how to meet that want.
If we attract any members from out
side universities within our circle,
let us insist that they tell us all
they know of those corners of the
University World which we may
never enter. Before we can get the
training that is worth while from
social organization at Stanford we
must be more united, more pur
poseful, more conventional. And
we must find a way to accomplish
it while holding fast to our indi
viduality, our independence, and
our loyalty. Our democracy is not
the thing to throw away. We
must continue to be democratic,
but by government and not by vir
tue of that elusive thing called
"spirit."
