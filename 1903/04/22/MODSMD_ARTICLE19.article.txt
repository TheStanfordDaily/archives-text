# Sorority Life.

ln what way are fraternities,
and more especially sororities,
justified in being? Potentially,
the fraternity idea has in it infinite
possibilities and capacity for good.
Where actual conditions may fall
short of the ideal, the fault lies not
so much in the system itself as in
the abuse or misconception of it.
That there is power for good in the
system the growth and increase of
fraternities would seem to prove.
The best institutions are more and
more welcoming them.
To confine myself to "sororities,"
which especially illustrate the good


KAI'PA Ai.pha Tbhta
of the system, they may be esti
mated from two standpoints : as
regards their value to the college
community, and to the individual
members of the chapter.
Sororities at Stanford may be
taken collectively as standing for
much the same end. This is the
social development of the college
woman—by no means a small or
unimportant side of the "prepara
tion for complete living." There is
strength in any organized body, as
contrasted with numerous unor
ganized cliques or "groups" of
women, which inevitably exist in
any community. Unconsciously
though it may be, the organized
bodies, through their conspicuous
ness, if through nothing else, set
the social standard. They must
needs, in turn, because of this con
spicuousness, feel a responsibility
and a jealousy for good standards
of behavior, and for maintaining
the highest that is possible for them.
A girl in joining a sorority must
give up not a little independence of
action, as her behavior reflects back
upon her sorority. The individual
suffers for the good of the whole.
We do not entirely realize how
much power lies in the sorority to
mould the social attitude of all col-

lege women, a power that
is undoubtedly abused.
Then again each sorority
is a social center. It lends
attractiveness to college life.
It makes, or should make,
possible a larger acquaint
ance among the women, as
well as men, through its re
ceptions, dances, and din
ners.
But it is in regard to the
more personal benefits of in
dividual members that the
sorority is most valuable.
This may be a narrower side,
unless considered in the
light of "what is good for a
part is good for the whole."
The old objection to the
higher education for women,
on the ground that it devel
oped only the intellectual

and left out of account the domes
tic side, would fall utterly to
the ground with only a glimpse
into the inner workings of any
sorority at Stanford. Almost every
sorority function during the semes
ter is the result of the personal
supervision and labors of the girls
of the house. Committees are ap
pointed for house decoration, floors,
table, and refreshments, and every
one falls to with a will
to make the contemplated af
fair a "success." At the begin
ning of the year, I have known
sorority girls to make new sets of
curtains for the windows, and pi 1 -
lows for couches, and even jams
and jellies, to last through the year.
A sorority girl usually cares for
her own room. She frequently
does her own dressmaking. In one
sorority the Chinese cook is never
permitted to make the cakes for
any unusual affair, since the girls'
cakes are considered special
dainties. The sorority girl lias
had a practical course in "house
hold economics" if she lives very
long in a sorority house.
But it is not alone the "home
life" that the sorority girl enjoys.
The fraternity is the point where
the home and public life touch.
She .is continually meeting the
most cultured and distinguished
people of the land, and the con
stant demand that she act as
hostess gives her grace and ease of
manner and speech. She has cno
stant opportunity to show the best

in her. Any talents that she may
enjoy, are always in demand.
She gains also in sympathy,
unselfishness, and helpfulness,
through her intimate association
with a number of girls. Her know
ledge of human nature, if not ex
tensive, is at least intensive.
If the sorority girl can unite the
larger interests of college life with
her smaller sorority interests, and
convince her non-fraternity sisters
that she feels no sense of superior
ity; if she can pull down the bar
rier between fraternity and inde
pendent, and do away with the
sometimes justifiable criticisms of
narrowness and snobbishness, she
will approach most nearly to the
ideal, fully rounded college woman.

larger interests of college life with
her smaller sorority interests, and
convince her non-fraternity sisters
that she feels no sense of superior

rier between fraternity and inde
pendent, and do away with the
sometimes justifiable criticisms of
narrowness and snobbishness, she
will approach most nearly to the
ideal, fully rounded college woman.
