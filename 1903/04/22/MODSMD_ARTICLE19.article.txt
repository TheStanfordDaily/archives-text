# Sorority Life.

### Vivian Bailey, â€™02 
ln what way are fraternities,
and more especially sororities,
justified in being? Potentially,
the fraternity idea has in it infinite
possibilities and capacity for good.
Where actual conditions may fall
short of the ideal, the fault lies not
so much in the system itself as in
the abuse or misconception of it.
That there is power for good in the
system the growth and increase of
fraternities would seem to prove.
The best institutions are more and
more welcoming them.
To confine myself to "sororities,"
which especially illustrate the good
