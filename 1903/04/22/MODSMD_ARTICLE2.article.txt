Easiest of access
anions all the can
ons of Colorado, be
ing situated on the
main line of the Den
ver & Rio Grande
between Canon City
and Salida in the
front range of the
Rockies, it is the
most spectacular,
awe-inspiring, and
magnificent. Down
this mighty cleft in
the heart of the
granite rock-barrier
rush the raging
waters of the Ar
kansas river, lashed
into foaming fury
and dashed into
spuming spray by
its swift descent
through the tortuous
defile. So narrow
is the passage at one
point that there was

no room for both road and river, and therefore a curiously con
structed bridge of steel had to be thrown lengthwise of the stream,
suspended from iron supports mortised into the canon walls
on each side to the right and left. And right here can be seen
the climax of all the great canon's grandeur, that which has been
aptly called " The Royal Gorge." For two thousand six hundred
feet the solid monoliths soar upward—five times as lofty as the
Washington monument, the highest permanent structure reared by
the hand of man. No words can adequately describe the magnifi
cence of the scene. Only those who have beheld its glories can
appreciate them.
The Canon of the Grande
on the main line of the Denver & Rio Grande road just after reaching
Glenwood Springs. For a distance of sixteen miles the towering
walls of the canon rise on each side, confining the river and the
track within narrow limits and rising at times to the stupendous
height of nearly half a mile of perpendicular ascent. Ihe stratifica-

tion of the walls is plainly mark
ed, a characteristic not present in
many of the famous canons of Co
lorado ; and in addition to the won
derful variety of shape assumed by
the rock formations, their colors are
quite as wonderfully varied. Brilliant
tints of red and yellow, of maroon,
lavender, pink and amber make
the walls a constant study, and
lend a delightful variety to the
scene. The overwhelming gran

Nature's archi

ened and beau
tified by these
chromatic orna
mentations, and
the effect upon
the mind of the
spectator is that
of mingled de
light and awe.
