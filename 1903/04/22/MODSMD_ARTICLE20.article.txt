### “A Brookfarmer. ” 
The Camp, that disappeared last year
much to the general regret, furnished to
Stanford, from pioneer days on, life and
ability the color of which was truly red.
Perhaps the most original phase of col
lege existence that ever appeared there
was an enterprise conceived and in the
main executed by the women students
who organized "Brook Farm," a club
described by a member as "a personal
institution quite similar in its tone and
ideals to a family." In the cardinal
chairs around the "Brook Farm" dining
table sat a group of the most brilliant men

and women who ever attended Stanford.
Among the girls were the debaters who
made the Saturday Night Club at that
time the strongest woman's organization
in the University; there were the women
who did most to support the college pub
lications, and the women who were
the life of athletics. The names of the
men who joined them in the "Brook
Farm" club are still household words on
the campus.—Ed.
In the the fall of the year '97 three
feminine undergraduates were strol
ling along the Row from their
boarding-house. After some dis
cussion of the social discomforts
incident to an incompatible table
group, the one who always joked
suggested a dining club as the
solution. The two who always put
things through took the jocular re
mark as an inspiration, and inside
of twenty-four hours eight congen
ial spirits were eager to make the
experiment—were ready to dine
together—but where?
The only available space on the
Campus was the Camp, then flour
ishing as one of the unique factors
of Stanford life; and last year torn
down to make way for more har
monious architecture. The Camp
was a series of one-story barrack
like wooden buildings, originally
for the accommodation of the work
men who made the Inner Quad and
Roble and Encina. When those
endearing structures were complet
ed, many a young man who craved
a share in the life of the Quad and
saw no prospect of it if the way led
through Encina, discovered that if
he fitted up one of the tiny work

ingmen's apartments in the Camp,
payed .$2 for room rent, cooked his
own meals, and gardened, washed
dishes, and waited on table around
on the Campus, lie could become a
Stanfordite, —if he had the courage
to bear the "manual-work" stigma.
The snobbish affliction, though
[ much less pronounced at Stanford
than elsewhere, still had penetrated
there, as into every other corner of
America.
The Camp filled, and stayed full
through its short but significant
life. Many of the men whose un
dergraduate work was most earnest
and individual began their college
life in the Camp.
It was an easy matter for the
Dining Club to rent three rooms
there. These were fitted up during
the Christmas holidays,—one as a
pantry and the others thrown to
gether as a dining-room. The fur
nishings were of the simplest and
quietest-savefor the cardinal chairs.
The club was no sooner installed
than Hilly Erb named it "Brook
Farm." Encina approved the
christening and it stuck. Gin, the
Chinaman of the camp, had con
tracted to cook for the club if they
would make out the breakfast,
luncheon and dinner lists, and

j have a student to attend to pantry
and dining-room.
The first meal was a luncheon,
which proved so atrocious that the
members talked incoherently and
dared not lift their eyes from the
table for fear they should read in
the other faces "the experiment will
prove a failure." However, in a few
days the machinery was in order,
they began to enjoy their after
dinner ''reads," and to think of an
i other of the chief motives for their
organization —the entertainment of
friends among the faculty and stu
dents in the simple, satisfying man
ner possible at a dinner gathering.
The first of these "evenings to re
member" was a dinner shared by
Doctor and Mrs. Jordan; and it
was followed by many similar eve
nings with "Major Prof." and "un
dergrade
At the end of the college year, all
but three of the eight finished their
University life, and Brook Farmers
scattered over the United States
with the keenest affection for the
little dining-room in the Camp,
symbolic of fun and friendship,
and an effort to gain the best in
college life.
That the experiment was success
ful was no doubt greatly due to the
| comparative newness of Stanford
and the small number of students,
j Everyone knew everyone else:
faculty and students were bound
I together in a sympatic personal
, relation during the first bright per-
I iod of University organization.
