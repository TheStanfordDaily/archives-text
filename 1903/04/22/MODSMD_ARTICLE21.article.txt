The Young Women's Christian
Association has a large and active
branch at Stanford. It is the pur
pose of the organization here to
bind together the Christian women
of Stanford regardless of denomina
tion, that they may strenghten
each other and be more effective in
helping to make the life of our Uni
versity women wholesome and
Christian. Usually the new stu
dents first learn of the Associa
tion through the welcome they re
ceive at its Information Bureau.
Here they may get help in the per
plexities of the first few days.
The so-called practical work of
the Association is not so great as it
would be if we were located in a
large city; but we have been able to
help in city work by collecting old
clothes, books ami magazines, for
various institutions.
J The Association seeks to widen
the friendships of the women of
the University by giving social
gatherings to which all are invited,
as well as others for its members
only. A large number of the As
sociation members are in weekly
Bible classes, studying either the
Life of Christ or the Acts and
J Epistles. One of the classes is led

by Mrs. Alden, and the
other six by students. The
mission study classes are
learning something of what
the Christian church has
done and is doing in foreign
lands. We are also helping
to support the work by pay
ing part of the salary of our
Christian Association secre
tary in India, and the ex
penses of a girl in a Persian
seminary.
It has been our aim to
make the weekly religious
meetings of the Association
varied enough to appeal
to every woman. Some of
them are given over to a
discussion of some phase of
Christian life by the mem
bers present; others are de
voted to a study of missions.

One meeting each month is given
to a speaker outside the Associ
ation. Theresa Wilbur, '03,
President.
