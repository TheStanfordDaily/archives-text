# Y. W. C. A. Club.
## 
### 
In the spring of 1902, at the
I suggestion of Mrs. Charles Henry
i Gilbert, several members of the
| Stanford Y. W. C. A. began plan
ning the organization of a coopera
tive club. During the summer Mrs.
Gilbert secured a house at 481
Lytton avenue, Palo Alto. Jane
L. Bean, '04, was appointed busi
ness manager, and under her
efficient supervision the house
was made ready for occupancy at
the opening of the fall semes
ter.
Under the guidance of Mrs. M.
F. Gregory as matron and Harriet
F. liuss, '06, as house president
and official head of the club,the pur
pose of the organizers "to establish
at actual cost the best possible
home for the members," is being
happily realized.
Although the club was planned
and organized by members of the
Young Women's Christian Associa
tion, and has been under the pa
tronage of the Association's advis
ory board, its finances and man
agement are wholly separate from
those of the Association. It is self
supporting, and is conducted on a
purely democratic basis, each mem
ber having a vote on all matters
pertaining to the general welfare.
