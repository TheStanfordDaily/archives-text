The editors of this Woman's
Edition of The Daily Palo Alto
have had in view two objects: First,
it has been our aim to embody in
one issue some expression of what the
women of Stanford have done for their
University. Stanford is as yet too
young to have a history, still not so
young but that rapidly passing semes
ters are burying under the accumulat
ing records of recent events the dus
ty recollection of earlier things. If
anywhere in this Edition there is
truthfully stated any occurrence the
exact account of which was gradually
becoming legend; if anywhere we
have mentioned a good deed done for
Stanford by any Stanford woman, or
brought a half-forgotten name into
even momentary grateful memory,
then we have gained our first object,
and the Edition bears its own excuse
for being.
In every line of college activity the
women of Stanford hold an enviable
record; on the publications, in debat
ing and in athletics, they are well to
the fore. And those who formerly as
undergraduates stood for something
in these things here, as alumnae scat
tered far and wide, now stand for
something bigger ever} where. And,
if any Stanford girl in reading either
our imperfect accounts of what these
women accomplished as students, or
their own statements from the field of
wider endeavor, shall find written in
these columns any message of encour
agement to do and be, then this Edi
tion has gained its second object, and
its editors rest content.
