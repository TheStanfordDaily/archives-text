There are a great many students
in Stanford University to whom the
phrase "Stanford spirit" suggests
football rallies, rooting sections,—and
nothing more. These are students
who get their lessons out of hooks
and depart with an education, leaving
nothing in exchange. Some of them
arc men; and some are women. Al
though the act in either case is equal
ly reprehensible, we will devote our
selves to the woman "dead-head,"
recommending the masculine "bum
mer" to the attention of "Chappie,"
or whoever else feels qualified to deal
with him. For it must be recognized
that the man who folds his one talent

in a napkin, accepts an education, and
returns nothing to his University, is
deserving of condemnation.
As for the woman who attends
Stanford for four years and is gradu
ated without having left her impress
upon the University life, she may not
protest with any justice that the field
of a woman's activities is limited.
Her University offers the Stanford
woman free and equal privileges; it is
left to her to use or to abuse them.
The records of what Stanford women
have done show that there is no prize
beyond her reach. Absolutely every
thing, from editorship to debating
team, from farce prize to Varsity U S,"
has been hers when she has earned it.
On the other hand, to the girl who is
no part of any student affair, or who
neglects to pay her class assessments
or her student body dues, casts an ig
norant vote at the elections, or refuses
support to a worthy cause, her Univ
ersity, still generous, does not deny
an education, as far as it can come
merely from books; but there goes on
record a debt against that girl's name
to balance which she offers nothing.
It is inevitable in human progress
that a few shall lead and that the lead
ers shall take the brunt of the work.
But for those who neither lead nor
follow, there should not be left the
lame excuse that they had no chance.
The Stanford spirit, to those who
know it best, is like loyalty to a
friend,a spontaneous rising of the best
that is in us for the good of Alma Ma
ter. It is University patriotism and
is as fully expressed in the payment
of the student body fee by a working
student as in the heroic efforts of a
track man. It may find expression
in a story given to a college paper,
or in a subscription; likewise in a vote
for the best candidate, and a tender
regard for the good name of the Uni
versity. The Stanford spirit is not
a poet's dream; neither is it specially
associated with yells and cheers. It
is held in monopoly by neither ath
letes nor rooters, but lies in the heart
of every man or woman who gives
thought for the good of our Univer
sity.
In student organizations and activ
ities, in literature and debating and
athletics, there is always great oppor
tunity for the woman who would en
ter into Stanford life. One element
attends it all —work. Is it because of
this that so many turn aside and com
promise with glory by having their
picture in the Quad —but, alas! only
as a member of the Junior class?
For the women who lead, the Stan
ford spirit will have at times, per
haps, the color of self-sacrifice. It is
hard to do one's best for the general
good and fail; harder yet to meet the
criticism of those who might have
helped. For the Stanford woman
who feels the spirit of University pa
triotism, there is always a place and a
work. As its reward comes the feel
ing that she means something and is
justified by her work.
The women who have taken an ef
fective part in college life and who
have received the appreciation oftheir
fellow students, have had certain char

acteristics in common: they have been
capable of cooperation with men,
they have had no grievances to ad
vertise, and they have taken the criti
cisms and hardships incident to pub
lic performance in good temper.
There is a place of leadership here
for the exceptional woman, and for
the rest of us there is an opportunity
for loyalty to that leadership.
