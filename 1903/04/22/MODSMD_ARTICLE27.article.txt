No one is in a better positon to
realize who are the friends of Stan
ford University than is the student
who solicits the advertising necessary
to support a Stanford publication.
The management of this Edition
met with hearty support on the part
of the merchants of Palo Alto. A
glance at our advertising pages will
discover there the name of nearly
every firm in the town. We recom
mend them especially to the women
of Stanford, in whose name we asked,
and received, their patronage.
In San Francisco the management
met with varying receptions, but, on
the whole, with marked success. We
present the advertisements of firms
which solicit the Stanford trade; since
they bid for it, it should go their
way.
But there is a word to be said of
the houses whose advertisement we
did not get. When a firm supports
our University publications for a year
or two, and still our trade goes per
sistently to a rival who uniformly re
fuses to advertise with us, the first
merchant is excused in discontinuing
that support. When previous busi
ness managers representing college
publications have failed to keep their
contracts with a house, we cannot ex
pect that house to overlook the mat
ter and advertise with us. And cer
tainly, we can expect no favor from
the business man who has met with
downright dishonesty on the part oi
Stanford students. We have had in
stances of all three phases brought to
our attention by the houses whose
advertisement we did not get.
On the other hand, we met busi
ness men who have always received
fair treatment from Stanford and still
expect it. They favor us and should
receive our favor.
