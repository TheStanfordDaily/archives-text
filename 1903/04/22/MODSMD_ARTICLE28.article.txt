Much has been said concerning
those students who, on registration
clay, refuse or neglect to pay their
Students' Guild fee of fifty cents. It
would seem that where so few fees are
asked and practically none are com
pulsory, a small sum might be spared
by each one of us for so necessary an
organization. The reason usually
given for a refusal to pay this fee is
that the students who join the Guild
and who are thereby entitled to its as
sistance are persons who would never
ask for such aid, and who could afford
to pay their own expenses should they
become ill. The Guild, it is asserted,
accordingly fails to reach the students
who need its help. As a matter of
fact, most of the students who join
the Guild do so without any intention
of calling upon it for their own bene
fit, knowing that at a time like the
present the Guild must help many

students who have not joined and who
are unable to help themselves. By far
the greater number of those whom
the Guild has cared for are not now
members at all. Yet no one who
has paid his fee can feel that the
organization should refuse aid to any
such persons, nor can he doubt that
the Guild is now doing very valuable
work. Last semester four complete
sick-room outfits were purchased,
each one practically a portable hos
pital, containing everything which a
nurse finds essential for her work in
any case. These four outfits have all
been in constant use ever since Christ
mas, and twelve more have recently
been purchased, all of which are
being used. In addition, an emer
gency hospital has been fitted up in
Encina and within the last two days
another in Palo Alto. The question
is, who would have undertaken this
work had there been no Students
Guild ?
When one considers that out of
this big student body only about
184 persons have paid their Guild
assessment this semester he must
realize that the treasury is in need of
more fees. A time limit was set for
paying these assessments earlier in
the semester, it is true; but under
stress of circumstances this has been
removed, and students may pay
them at any time. It is to be hoped
that all who have not yet joined the
Guild will do so even at this late
day, knowing that the need is great,
and that the money is of the utmost
value to the organization just now.
