# Salt Lake City
## 
### 
From your car window you catch glimpses of the quaint, curious
and picturesque City of Salt Lake, with its broad avenues of shade
and martial rows of cotton woods and tall poplars bending in the
gentle summer breezes. It is towards the Temple Square that the
first impulse directs the wanderer in this strange "City of the Saint."
In it are clustered the several edifices of the Mormon Church. Here
is the huge Tabernacle, the Great Temple and Assembly Hall, the
Tithing House, the Church Offices and the Bee-Hive and Lion
Houses, and but a block distant is the Amelia Palace, the Eagle Gate
and the shrine of Brigham Young.
In the distance is that marvelous body of salt water—the Great
Salt Lake which is rivaled only in its saline properties by the Dead
Sea of Galilee. Hourly, during the season, the railroad carries its
throng of bathers and pleasure seekers to "Saltair,"a resort of mag
nificent proportions. With a dip in this silver sea, you are bathing
in the most inland body of salt water in the world —and that, paradox
ical as it is, in a sea almost a mile above sea level. In this water
the human body cannot sink, and one has but to thrust himself on
the bosom of the lake, stretch out his arms and float as if to the
manner born.

Our personally conducted Tourist Ex
cursions are the cheapest and most com
fortable means of reaching all points
East. Write for particulars to
