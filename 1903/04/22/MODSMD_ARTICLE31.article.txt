During the summer of 1902 the
Committee on Student Affairs gave
notice to all lodging houses both in
Palo Alto and upon the campus that
if it was expected to rent to Stanford
girls there must be provided adequate
reception-rooms for the use of the
young women. In spite of this regula
tion it is the exception to find in
lodging houses, upon the campus at
least, any proper provision in this di
rection. In some instances no recep
tion room at all is open; in other
cases permission is given to receive
friends in the hall; again, the family
sitting-room may be had on occas
ions. Young women students should
insist upon having the use of a suit
able parlor. Any house renting them
rooms and yet failing to offer such ac
commodation is violating the order of
the faculty committee, and the mat
ter should be reported.
