# The 						Difference

As she passes the sphinxes at the
gate, the young woman entering
Stanford is told that here within,
"the wind of freedom blows." Nat
urally, she sets herself to watching
straws.
Hitherto she has been under
parental control and the strict super
vision of the school-room; she has
sought the guidance of her pastor in
religious matters and asked the opin
ion of her neighbors on social
questions. But once beyond the
sphinxes she is free. She may wear
her best frock every day and enter
"sundries" in her account book with
some assurance. She soon discov
ers that in a class of fifty she may
safely look wise and say nothing for
four days in the week, and even ven
ture an occasional "unprepared" on
the fifth. As for religious matters,
she reads Chaparral jokes on the
Y. M. C. A., and when she asks her

junior roommate the vilal question,
"Is it wicked to dance?" the flip
pant answer comes, — "That depends
on whether you get a bid to the
Prom." At home she consulted
with her mother concerning her
guests and the refreshments for her
parties. Here she may give chafing
dish affairs as often as she can pin
her notice the first on the music
room door. In short, she may turn
the liberty of this University into
license.
At home she used to entertain her
admirers at the post-office while
waiting for the mail, and at the sta
tion when she strolled down to see
who came on the train. She went
driving by moonlight with Jim Smith,
and came back when the horse was
tired. She did those things at home;
everybody knew it and nobody ques
tioned it. She was Jennie Jones, at
home, only daughter of Mr. John
Jones, the pioneer capitalist.
Hut when Mr. James Smith, a soph
omore, in return for the chafing-dish
parties, led on by smiles exchanged
on the quad, emboldened at last by a
walk in the arboretum, takes Miss
Jones, freshman, for a night drive at
Stanford, the junior roommate grows
sober and Jennie finds her waiting
up by candle-light on her return.
They have a heart-to-heart talk.
Then a thousand things Jennie
supposed were permitted here in
Stanford freedom are held up to
her and called indiscretions. The
walk and the drive merely cap the
climax. Jennie, between sobs, just
wishes she could send for her pastor
and her Uncle Fred and the president
of the bank to tell people she is a
respectable and trustworthy girl. She
and Jim have known each other years
and years The junior room mate
is fortunate if she can explain that
these things were well enough in
Jennie Jones, daughter of Mr. John
Jones, the pioneer capitalist, but they
are severely censured in Miss Jones,
freshman, one of five hundred at
Stanford.
