Within a month two books, the
work of Stanford women, will appear,
that will be of universal interest to
Stanford people. Both have seemed
a necessity for some time, and the
wonder is that the work of pub
lishing them has been so long left
undone.
The first, under the title
"A Visit to Stanford University,"
by Mary Stewart Quelle, ex-'oi,
is written in dialogue form, and
gives a stranger a better idea of what
Stanford was and is than anything
that has yet been published. The
size of the book will make it conven
ent for reference while driving about
the University. Beginning with the
tall redwood tree, after which the
University estate was named, the
book gives a good bit of the history of
Stanford. Concise descriptions of
the place, the life here, the buildings,
the surrounding country, etc., supply
the rest. The reading matter and
the illustrations, which are excellent,
are about evenly distributed, thus
making an attractive little book
which will undoubtedly have a large
sale when it appears about May ist.
The second publication is a small
collection of the songs of Stanford
University, edited by Chita Kraft,
'03. As far as possible it will be
historical, but the songs which have
never been snng generally will be
omitted. The edition will include
from filteen to twenty songs more or
less dear to the Stanford heart, illus
trated by Stanford artists of the past
and present.
