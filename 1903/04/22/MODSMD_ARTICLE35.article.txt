The first senior farce given at Stan
ford was written by Eugenia Mabury,
'94, an English major, registered from

i San Jose. It was called "Sold," and
j was purely local in interest, the per
sonal hits being especially appreciat
ed. It was presented during their
I senior week by the class of' 94. As
was customary in the days before
there was an Assembly Hall, Encina
Gymnasium was converted into a tem
porary theatre for the occasion. As
the expenses were met by assessment,
admission was free to all, the seniors
receiving reserved seat tickets.
Sarah Comstock, '96, is the only
woman who has ever won out in a
regular farce competition; that method
of choice was not yet established at
the time Miss Mabury's farce was se
lected. Miss Comstock wrote the jun
ior farce "Cat's Cradle," presented by
the class of' 96 on the afternoon of
their Junior Day, which came in
April, 1895. The play was given in
EncinaGymnasium, which was already
decorated for the "Junior Hop," of
the evening. The electric lighting
and scenery were more elaborate than
any preceding. A special scene,
painted by a San Francisco artist from
a photograph, represented Lagunita,
and won enthusiastic applause. The
class of' 94 had already pictured the
quadrangle, but this was the most
pretentious stage setting yet attempt
ed. Ihe farce was good; the second
act was original in that it took place
at a Roble spread, and only girls ap
peared in it. Another feature was Miss
Wilson's impersonation of Charley
Field, who was famous for a stunt as
"Madame Clementine Cardinale."
The farce was staged, managed and
acted by members of the class of '96
only; and only juniors were at that
time allowed to enter the contest for
the junior farce prize. As it was be
fore the day of posters, the joshing
was limited to a bogus program issued
by the Pioneer Class, then seniors.
That little hand-bill contains interest
ing announcements: "The price be
ing unusually exorbitant for such a
poor show, professors will not bring
their wives." "Dedication Ceremon
ies: Immediately before the third act
the audience on leaving the Gym in a
body will repair to Hodge's lawn
where the architect's dog will be ded
icated to the class of '96." "As
everything that '96 has a hand in dur
ing the day will be charged for up to
the limit, '95 presents this program
gratis with its compliments."
On the 15th of October, 1902, El
Club Tertulia, the Spanish Club of
Stanford, gave at Roble Hall an open
session to invited friends, at which
was presented a short farce entitled
"Calderon contra Ramsey." It was
an original production, the joint work
of Fred H. Fowler,'o4, and Irene A.
Wright,'o4. The skit was notable as
the first original farce to be written
and presented in a foreign tongue by
the students of any American univer
sity.
