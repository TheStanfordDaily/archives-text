### 
From the earliest days of the
University, Stanford has shown an
interest in music, and her musical
organizations were among the first
to be formed here. The Band, at
present a most excellent one, was
organized in pioneer times, and
although it has in the past
sunk into oblivion at the end of
the football season, this year
maintained its place as a perma
nent organization. The Orchestra,
as well, is associated with the
youth of the University, but has
during the last two years shown
greater activity than ever before,
with its annual concerts, and most
especially with its fine work in the
"Antigone" of a year ago. Two
other early organizations, the
Choral Society and the Banjo Club,
both succeeded for a time and then
dropped out of existence. The
Varsity Glee and Mandolin Clubs
are too well known to require men
tion here, save to say that they are
both "old-timers," and have nearly
always had an annual trip on
which they have met with success.
The women's musical organiza
tions of the first years led a
desultory and uncertain existence,
as may be seen from the variety of
names under which they existed.
The Girls' Mandolin Club.
Beginning in 1893 as "The Roble
Mandolin Club," the Girls' Mando
lin Club has existed intermittently
for ten years, under the successive
names of "The Young Ladies' Man
dolin Club," "The Women's Man
dolin Club," "The Roble Mandolin
Club" once more, "The Ladies'
Mandolin Club," and finally "The
Girls' Mandolin Club," —its pres
ent official designation.
To Louise McDougald, ex-'02,
who took charge of the club in

1899, its success for the next three
years is due. Anna Ashenfelter,
'02, followed her as leader last
year, while at present Claire Sweet
man, '04, is directing the club.
The members now are: Ethel Fi
field, '04, president; Claire Sweet
man, '04, leader; Ella lbs, '03, sec
retary; Audrey Brown, '03, Helen
Whitehead, '04, Alice Richards,
'05, Minerva Nyman, '05, Mabel
Harris, '05, Bertha Henzel, '06,
Josephine Herron, '06, Mabel
O'Brien, '06, and E. W. Henrich,

Stanford Girls' Glee Club.
On September 10, 1893, a meet
ing of girls was called at Roble for
the purpose of organizing a glee
club. The response to the call
was evidently insufficient to war-

rant the formation of such a club,
since there is no record of any such
action on the part of the girls.
The 1895 Quad mentions the
"Ladies' Glee Club" with a mem
bership of twenty-two, Miss Gris
wold being their leader. With
this auspicious beginning, it is
surprising to find that, like the Man
dolin Club, the Glee, too, passed
out of existence during the next
year. Not until 1899 did the club
reorganize, this time adopting for
its official name "The Stanford
Girls' Glee Club." Since that
time it has been a permanent or
ganization, averaging twenty mem
bers. The club unquestionably
owes its present existence to the
untiring efforts of May Hurlburt,
'02, who did more than any one
else to put it upon a firm footing.

STANFORD IN THE HEART.
Oh, the golden plain in the summer time,
And the oak-trees fleeing up the hills!
Oh, the redwoods high
'Gainst the western sky,
When the dusk of eve all the vallev fills;
This, ah, this is Stanford,
Stanford in the heart evermore.
Oh, the sunset glow in the winter-time,
With its rose and purple on the hills;
Oh, the springing grass
When the showers pass,
And the rain-splashed Quad when the south-wind shrills;
This, ah, this is Stanford,
Stanford in the heart evermore.
Oh, the joyous days of the sweet spring-time,
When the poppies bloom on the hills ;
When the meadow-lark's song
Rises all day long,
And the touch of love through the whole world thrills;
This, ah, this is Stanford,
Stanford in the heart evermore.

The Glee Club is this year com
posed of the following members:
Mrs. Edna Walker, '03, president;
Cecilia Atherton, '03, Grace Chan
dler, '03, Chita Kraft, '03, Jeraldine
Brown, '04, Beatrice Lessey, '04,
Mabel Barnhouse, '04, Ethel Fos
ter, '04, Lela Beebe, '04, Grace
Bruckman, '04, Inez Hyatt, '04,
Helen Lewis, '05, Pansy Woods,
'05, Cecil Raber, '05, Harriet Still
son, '05, Edna Wilson, '06, Stella
Sankey, '06, Gertrude Beeger, '06,
Data Roth rock, '06, Jeanette Hay
ward, '06, Jennie Roller, '06, Rose
mary Stolz, '06, Jessie Greyson,
gr., Josephine Herron, '06, Edith
Edgerly, '04.

The requirements for admis
sion to membership in the
musical organizations in a col
lege cannot, for obvious reasons,
be made very severe. The Orches
tra welcomes anyone who plays
any instrument, and the applicant
is not long in finding out whether
or not the music is beyond him.
All the women violinists who have
been in the University have be
longed to the Orchestra; in fact
Winifred June Morgan, ex-'O3, was
its leader during '00-'Ol.
Applicants for places on the
Mandolin Club must, similarly, be
able to read music with some ease,
and to play fairly well, while for
the Glee Club the voices must be
true and of a quality that will
blend with others. The ability to
read music at sight is presupposed,
but not compulsory. Try-outs are
held twice a year.
An account of the musical organ
izations at Stanford does not
strictly include mention of the
choir of Memorial Church, yet it
deserves at least a passing reference
as one of the opportunities at hand.

Stanford Girls' Glee Club



Girls' Mandolin Club
From the earliest days of the
University, Stanford has shown an
interest in music, and her musical
organizations were among the first
to be formed here. The Band, at
present a most excellent one, was
organized in pioneer times, and
although it has in the past
sunk into oblivion at the end of
the football season, this year
maintained its place as a perma
nent organization. The Orchestra,
as well, is associated with the
youth of the University, but has
during the last two years shown
greater activity than ever before,
with its annual concerts, and most
especially with its fine work in the
"Antigone" of a year ago. Two
other early organizations, the
Choral Society and the Banjo Club,
both succeeded for a time and then
dropped out of existence. The
Varsity Glee and Mandolin Clubs
are too well known to require men
tion here, save to say that they are
both "old-timers," and have nearly
always had an annual trip on
which they have met with success.
The women's musical organiza
tions of the first years led a
desultory and uncertain existence,
as may be seen from the variety of
names under which they existed.
The Girls' Mandolin Club.
Beginning in 1893 as "The Roble
Mandolin Club," the Girls' Mando
lin Club has existed intermittently
for ten years, under the successive
names of "The Young Ladies' Man
dolin Club," "The Women's Man
dolin Club," "The Roble Mandolin
Club" once more, "The Ladies'
Mandolin Club," and finally "The
Girls' Mandolin Club," —its pres
ent official designation.
To Louise McDougald, ex-'02,
who took charge of the club in

1899, its success for the next three
years is due. Anna Ashenfelter,
'02, followed her as leader last
year, while at present Claire Sweet
man, '04, is directing the club.
The members now are: Ethel Fi
field, '04, president; Claire Sweet
man, '04, leader; Ella lbs, '03, sec
retary; Audrey Brown, '03, Helen
Whitehead, '04, Alice Richards,
'05, Minerva Nyman, '05, Mabel
Harris, '05, Bertha Henzel, '06,
Josephine Herron, '06, Mabel
O'Brien, '06, and E. W. Henrich,
'06.
Stanford Girls' Glee Club.
On September 10, 1893, a meet
ing of girls was called at Roble for
the purpose of organizing a glee
club. The response to the call
was evidently insufficient to war-

rant the formation of such a club,
since there is no record of any such
action on the part of the girls.
The 1895 Quad mentions the
"Ladies' Glee Club" with a mem
bership of twenty-two, Miss Gris
wold being their leader. With
this auspicious beginning, it is
surprising to find that, like the Man
dolin Club, the Glee, too, passed
out of existence during the next
year. Not until 1899 did the club
reorganize, this time adopting for
its official name "The Stanford
Girls' Glee Club." Since that
time it has been a permanent or
ganization, averaging twenty mem
bers. The club unquestionably
owes its present existence to the
untiring efforts of May Hurlburt,
'02, who did more than any one
else to put it upon a firm footing.

STANFORD IN THE HEART.
Oh, the golden plain in the summer time,
And the oak-trees fleeing up the hills!
Oh, the redwoods high
'Gainst the western sky,
When the dusk of eve all the vallev fills;
This, ah, this is Stanford,
Stanford in the heart evermore.
Oh, the sunset glow in the winter-time,
With its rose and purple on the hills;
Oh, the springing grass
When the showers pass,
And the rain-splashed Quad when the south-wind shrills;
This, ah, this is Stanford,
Stanford in the heart evermore.
Oh, the joyous days of the sweet spring-time,
When the poppies bloom on the hills ;
When the meadow-lark's song
Rises all day long,
And the touch of love through the whole world thrills;
This, ah, this is Stanford,
Stanford in the heart evermore.

The Glee Club is this year com
posed of the following members:
Mrs. Edna Walker, '03, president;
Cecilia Atherton, '03, Grace Chan
dler, '03, Chita Kraft, '03, Jeraldine
Brown, '04, Beatrice Lessey, '04,
Mabel Barnhouse, '04, Ethel Fos
ter, '04, Lela Beebe, '04, Grace
Bruckman, '04, Inez Hyatt, '04,
Helen Lewis, '05, Pansy Woods,
'05, Cecil Raber, '05, Harriet Still
son, '05, Edna Wilson, '06, Stella
Sankey, '06, Gertrude Beeger, '06,
Data Roth rock, '06, Jeanette Hay
ward, '06, Jennie Roller, '06, Rose
mary Stolz, '06, Jessie Greyson,
gr., Josephine Herron, '06, Edith
Edgerly, '04.

The requirements for admis
sion to membership in the
musical organizations in a col
lege cannot, for obvious reasons,
be made very severe. The Orches
tra welcomes anyone who plays
any instrument, and the applicant
is not long in finding out whether
or not the music is beyond him.
All the women violinists who have
been in the University have be
longed to the Orchestra; in fact
Winifred June Morgan, ex-'O3, was
its leader during '00-'Ol.
Applicants for places on the
Mandolin Club must, similarly, be
able to read music with some ease,
and to play fairly well, while for
the Glee Club the voices must be
true and of a quality that will
blend with others. The ability to
read music at sight is presupposed,
but not compulsory. Try-outs are
