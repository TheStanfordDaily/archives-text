# DEBATING
## The
						Saturday Night Club. 
### 
The Saturday Night Club, the
woman's debating society of Stan
ford University, was organized in
1897 at an informal gathering in
the room of Edith Mansfield on Ai
varado Row. It was the outcome
of a dinner-table discussion, as to
why Stanford women took no in
terest in debating,a topic suggested
by the absence of women on the
Carnot preliminaries for that year.
The purpose of the society is four
fold:
1. To promote interest in debat
ing among women, both for its own
value and because it offers one
form of student activity in which
women can take an interest equally
with men.
2. To achieve the personal de
velopment acquired in public speak
ing, one phase of training which
receives but little stimulus from
the greater part of University life.
3. To give training in parliamen
tary usage,—a matter of consider
able importance in these days of or
ganization.
4. By the discussion of questions
of current interest to keep the
members in touch with the large
movements of the outside world,
and to oppose to the specialization
of college life an intelligent interest
in present conditions and issues.
The society has been twice repre
sented on college teams, —in 1897 by
L. L. Stebbins, '98, on the winning
Intercollegiate, and in 1898 by
Anna Strunsky, ex-'OO, on the Car
not. Besides these, four members
have entered the preliminaries.
Elizabeth A. Everett, '03.
President.
