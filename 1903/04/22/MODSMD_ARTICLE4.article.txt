# AFTERMATH RALLY
## Field-day Victory Celebrated on the Oval Last Night. â€” General Jollification. 
### 
Stanford celebrated her victory
in field-day and debate by a gen
eral jollification on the diamond
last night.
Before the bonfire was lighted
the men formed in a procession,
headed by the Band, and did the
serpentine up the row past the pro
fessors' houses and the fraternity
lodges. Upon their return to the
diamond, after one swing around
the now blazing bonfire, they set
tled down on the ground in front
of the bleachers.
Led by H. P. Kuhn, they gave
cheer after cheer, neglecting no one
whose efforts had contributed
toward the double victory. When
the cheering had somewhat sub
sided, calls for Dr. Jordan were
heard from every side. Upon his
non-appearance Professor Farrand
was demanded.
In a short speech Professor Far
rand rejoiced over the removal
of the hoodoo, congratulated
the teams and their supporters
for their success in spite of
many discouragements, and com
mented upon the spirit of unity
and good sportsmanship displayed
by the men throughout. He ended
by assuring the students of the
good will and support of the fac
ulty.
l)r. Jordan had now appeared
and was immediately called for
ward. In a few hearty words he
spoke of his appreciation of the
victory and his hopes for many
more like it. He was encored vig
orously, in spite of his assertion
that the good thing about a speech
is that it is never encored.
Captain McCaughern was next
called for. He thanked the stu
dents for the loyalty and hearty
support accorded the team through
out the whole season as well as
upon the final day, and seemed
confident of further successes. He
was cheered heartily, as was also
"Dad" Moulton, who was escorted
to the platform by Dr. Jordan.
Moulton spoke of the unity
of spirit and faithful train
ing which had made success possi
ble. Upon his announcement that
he will remain in his present posi
tion for two more years, every man
present outdid himself in cheers
and enthusiasm.
The track men were next called
one by one. The first man put
forward was Norman Dole, whose
pole-vaulting decided the issue of
the meet. Dunn, Holman, Haw
ley, Crossman, Weller, and Thom
son followed.
The debaters were now called
out. Frank Roehr, representing
the team, made a short speech.
Several times during the evening
the plucky fight of Baker and
Weihe against sure defeat had been
commented upon, and they now
received cheers, as did the girls'
tennis team, which won the first
victory of the year.
After a final dance around the
bonfire, the rally broke up.
