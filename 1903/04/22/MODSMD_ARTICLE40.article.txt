# Stanford Women in Intercollegiate Debate.
## 
### 
Cora M. Palmer, '95, represented
Stanford in the second Intercollegi
ate Debate, which was held with
Berkeley in April of 1894. The
participation of a woman in the
contest was an innovation; none
had ever before taken part in an
intercollegiate debate upon the
Pacific Coast. The question was,
"Resolved, That the national own
ership and operation of the rail
roads of the United States would
better subserve the interests of the
people than does the present sys
tem of ownership and operation by
private corporation." Stanford had
the affirmative. The Metropolitan
Temple, in San Francisco, where
the event took place, was crowded
to its utmost capacity. The debate
was awarded to Stanford, and no
little of the credit fell to the first
woman debater.
Londa Stebbins, '98, spoke on
the Stanford team that met Cali
fornia in the Intercollegiate Debate
of 1897. The question was, "Re
solved, That each member of the
Cabinet should have a seat and
voice in Congress." Miss Stebbins
opened the debate for Stanford,
and was mistress of the situation
from her opening sentence. She
was interrupted by applause again
and again. In less than five min
utes after retiring the judges de
cided the debate in favor of Stan
ford, and the team brought home
the silver trophy cup which was
theirs permanently. In every re
spect, "both as regards argument
and manner of presentation," the
decision ran, the Stanford team
won.
Miss Stebbins entered Stanford

from the Oakland high school in
1895. She registered as a major
in Hygiene, and was at one time
assistant in the Gymnasium. She
became a member of the Saturday
Night Club a few weeks after

its organization, and was
its president in 1897.
Her interests were not
confined to debating, but
were enlisted in every stu
dent activity where women
could participate.
In debating, Miss Steb
bins' most prominent char
acteristic was a capacity
for close, logical analysis,
which gave to her pre
sentation of a subject a
decidedly judicial qual
ity.
Anna Strunsky, ex-'OO,
debated on the Stanford

team that met Berkeley in theCamot
Debate of 1898. She was born in
the village of Babinotz, in the
Vitebsk Gubernia of Russia, and
came with her parents to America
in 1880. She entered Stanford in
1896. Miss Strunsky was at the
time already prominent as a con
tributor to a radical New York
weekly, The Twentieth Century, had
been made secretary of the Socialist
Labor party in San Francisco,
which was her home, and bad de
livered a course of lectures on
socialistic topics.
The debate in which Miss
Strunsky figured was held in Shat
tuck Hall, Berkeley, and an audi
ence of over eight hundred people
was present. The question was,
''Resolved, That in the light of ex
perience, further extension of the
French colonial system would be
impolitic." Miss Strunsky was the
fifth speaker on the affirmative.
She handled her line of argument
well, as did the two preceding
members of the team. But the
medal was won fairly and squarely
by Charles E. Fryer, of California.
Few Stanford women have been
equal to Miss Strunsky in the ca
pacity for sympathetic and spontan
eous public speaking. She was
naturally an advocate rather than
a debater; where her emotional na
ture was warmly enlisted, her pow
ers of expression bordered close on
eloquence.
Anna Graeme Fraser, '00, de
bated for Stanford in the eighth
Intercollegiate against Berkeley in
1900. When she won in the try
outs in March, Miss Fraser was
considered an unknown quantity,
although she had spoken in prelimi
naries and finals, and was alter
nate on the Carnot team for that
year. The Intercollegiate Debate
was held in the Metropolitan Tem
ple, as usual, on May 5, 1900.
The question was, "Resolved, That
the guarantees of the Constitution
should extend to all persons and
territory under the permanent con
trol of the United States, except
persons living in tribal relations."
Stanford held the affirmative and
won the debate. Miss Fraser de
voted a large part of her time to a
sharp and effective rebuttal of her
opponents' contentions, and com
pletely won over the audience by
the persuasiveness and enthusiasm
with which she spoke, as well as
by her mastery of argument and
forceful delivery. Miss Fraser was
associate editor on the 11)00 Quad,
class secretary in her junior and
class historian in her senior year.

Few Stanford women have been
equal to Miss Strunsky in the ca
pacity for sympathetic and spontan
eous public speaking. She was
naturally an advocate rather than
a debater; where her emotional na
ture was warmly enlisted, her pow
ers of expression bordered close on
eloquence.
Anna Graeme Fraser, '00, de
bated for Stanford in the eighth
Intercollegiate against Berkeley in
1900. When she won in the try
outs in March, Miss Fraser was
considered an unknown quantity,
although she had spoken in prelimi
naries and finals, and was alter
nate on the Carnot team for that
year. The Intercollegiate Debate
was held in the Metropolitan Tem
ple, as usual, on May 5, 1900.
The question was, "Resolved, That
the guarantees of the Constitution
should extend to all persons and
territory under the permanent con
trol of the United States, except
persons living in tribal relations."
Stanford held the affirmative and
won the debate. Miss Fraser de
voted a large part of her time to a
sharp and effective rebuttal of her
opponents' contentions, and com
pletely won over the audience by
the persuasiveness and enthusiasm
with which she spoke, as well as
by her mastery of argument and
forceful delivery. Miss Fraser was
associate editor on the 11)00 Quad,
class secretary in her junior and
class historian in her senior year.
