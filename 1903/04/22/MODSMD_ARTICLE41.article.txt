H Ifi question has
been frequent
ly asked why
Stanfordwom
en do not fig
ure more con
sistently i n
the field of
debate. That
Held is open
to them. Since
the founda
tion of the
Un i ver si ty,
our faculty

and students
have been distinctive for the
courteous welcome which they
have accorded to woman in every
department of work for which her
talent fitted her. In spite of this 1
fact, the opportunities of forensic
training have rarely been improved
by our Stanford women. The at
tempts of the past, although mark
edly brilliant and successful, have
been spasmodic. The four women
who have made our Intercollegiate
teams have won honors not only
for themselves but for our institu
tion. Cora M. Palmer, '94, Londa
Stebbins, '1)8, Anna Strunsky, ex
'oo, and Anna Fraser, '00, helped
to bring . victory to Stanford.
These, however, were exceptional
women —women of remarkable in
telligence combined with superior
advantages and assertive charac
ter. Hut the question now arises,
Shall the work of our women
students in this line be solely of
this meteoric character? Is there
not a value in the work for the
average college woman as there is
for the average man? If so, where
are the benefits to be derived, and
what is the spirit in which women
should enter the work?
It may be held that women have
slight use for such training after
leaving college; but in view of the
clubs, institutes, and religious ser
vices so largely conducted by
women, this statement can hardly
be held as valid. A club woman re
cently told me that it was unwise for
a woman to attempt a speech, that
there was danger of rambling, and
that a well-written paper was much
more edifying. This is true for
the untrained woman. But with
instruction and practise, it is possi
ble to prepare a speech which shall
be equal in compactness of thought
and beauty of diction to any writ
ten paper, and to which may be
added, in delivery, the force of per
sonality —a power necessarily ab
sent in the reading of a paper.
It is a noticeable fact that in our
institutes the men deliver lectures,
while tlie women read papers. If
doubtless requires much more of
nerve and force of character to
look an audience in the face and at
the same time maintain one's
power of thought than it does to
read a paper. Hut is not that
force of character worth the ju ice?
If a woman is to come before the
public at all, why should she not
come in the most creditable man
ner?
Again, there are many women
who are entering the field of Chris
tian work. They are living good

lives, thinking of the deepest and
most vital questions, and have
helpful suggestions to give to their
companions; and yet how few are
ahle to express those thoughts
without prefixing to each an "J
think" or "It seems to me."

Jt cannot he gainsaid that there
is much of the earnest work of the
world which is now demanding
from woman the power of ready
and intelligent oral expression;
and in view of this practical need
and in consideration of the re
sourcefulness and poise which
reward the effort, this opportunity
of training should he no longer
neglected.
What is the spirit in which we
should enter the work? Certainly
our purpose should not he popu
larity, honor, or even college loy
alty alone, although honor should
and will come when it is deserved.
It betrays either a lack of knowl
edge of the true purpose of the
work, or a false notion of woman's
place in it, if she expects after one se
mester of labor to carry off honors,
given in recognition of an ability
and skill acquired by men only after
years of practise. It is a com
mendable feat to write and commit
a logical argument and, with some
elocutionary training, to give it
with pleasing effect; but this can lie
done quite as effectively in the
high school as in the university.
It is the function of college train
ing to prepare men and women to
be fluent and resourceful speakers.
Whether or not it be possible to
place our intercollegiate contests
on this basis, it is right that the
honors should be given to those
who have shown the greatest abil
ity in this direction.
What opportunities does our
University afford in this line?
First, Oral Debate, listed in our
Register as English 11 and History
22, a course which doubtless finds
no counterpart in the West, and
certainly not in our own State.
Here we may not only obtain prac
tise, but may derive profit from
the ability and experience of in
structors who are themselves skilled
debaters.
A second opening, aud perhaps
a more acceptable one to the timid
or inexperienced, is the Saturday
Night Club. Twenty-five or thirty
members is a good working num
ber for an organization of this kind,
and the five hundred women of
Stanford should furnish sufficient
ability and energy to support at
least three such societies. The
social as well as the intellectual
advantages of these meetings are
invaluable. They bring into sym
pathetic contact women of brains
and force.
Lastly, there are the interclass,
intercollegiate, and Carnot con
tests, which may be utilized by
those who have the definite purpose
to perfect their powers.
Let the next college year find our
Oral Debate course giving welcome
to more than one or two women.
The opening need not be forced.
Thanks to the liberal and pro
gressive spirit of our faculty, it
awaits our en trance.
