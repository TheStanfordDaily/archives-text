# BASKET-BALL.
## The Intercollegiate Game of 1896. Stanford 2, California 1.
### R.D.H. T 
Stanford, in the year 'yo-'DG, had
an energetic, first-class women's
basket-ball team. In an exciting
game played on the Ruble courts
on the afternoon of February 22d,
a team made up of Stella McCray,
captain, Merritt, Corbett, Walters,
Tucker, lviefer, Hyan, Morley and
Ducker, played and defeated Cas
tilleja by a score of 4-0. Miss
Edwards, from Castilleja, and Mr.
Greer, then a graduate student,
acted as umpire and referee; Jule
Frankenheimer, of football fame,
was time-keeper. An enthusiastic
crowd of seven hundred people
filled the bleachers and cheered the
contest. Two years previous to
this, March 17, 1894, the girls of
Castilleja had defeated Stanford
14-18.
Captain McCray had announced
just before the game was called
that if Stanford won, a challenge to
Berkeley would follow. It was sent
within a few days after the victory,
and Berkeley accepted on March
sth. In coming to an agreement,
Edith J. Brownsill, manager of the
California team, and Miss Kiefer,
acting in a similar capacity for
Stanford, decided that women only
should attend the game, and the
time was set for 2:30 in the after
noon, April 4th, in the Armory on
Pacific avenue, in San Francisco.
The rival teams trained faithfully.
The California girls depended on
their superiority in strength and
size, while Stanford staked every
thing on agility. Although Stan
ford much preferred a dirt or tan
bark floor, we were compelled to
yield that point, and Encina
Gymnasium was given over to the
girls that they might accustom
themselves to a hard floor. They
had never played except on the
dirt floor of the lioble court.
The preparation was exciting.
In Berkeley the nine went into
secret practise, and enthusiasm ran
so high that seniors offered to bet
their valued class hats upon the
prowess of the California players.
At Stanford interest was subdued,
but equally intense. The second
team turned out with spirit; there
were always substitutes to be had,
and our old rivals, the little girls
of Castilleja, came up to meet us in
hard practise. The last game be
fore the great event was held in
Encina Gym, with girls only as
spectators, and with Castilleja as
our self-sacrificing opponent.
The afternoon of April 4th found
the armory crowded with women
and gay with college colors. Yel
low poppies and cardinal carna
tions glowed everywhere. There
were ribbons on canes and umbrel
las, and worn in great bunches by
friends of the contesting teams.
Mrs. Timothy Hopkins brought her
daughter dressed all in Stanford
red, and the team claimed the little
lady as mascot.
Shortly after two o'clock the
California team appeared upon the
floor. They entered skipping and
dancing in time to the slogan:
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ca-li-for-ni-ah!
U. C. IWkeley!
Zip! Boom! Ah!

They were handsome girls,â€”par
ticularly so in their becoming cos
tumes of white sweaters with the
monogram U. C. in blue and gold,
dark blue bloomers, black stock
ings and shoes laced with yellow.
On her left shoulder each girl
had a rosette of the university
colors. Captain Griswold carried
the russet ball which was to go as
a trophy to the winners.
The Stanford team then entered,
marching in single Hie. The Stan
ford rooters' section in the gallery
gave the song cheer with a vim.
Horns brayed; colors were shaken
wildly in the air. The student
body had presented the girls with
the cardinal sweaters they wore.
Their cardinal caps of soft silk
added to the naturally gypsy-like

appearance of the girls, who were
I all small and dark.
The line-up was as follows:
BERKELEY. STANFORD.
Brownsill. . .c. home.. .. Keifer, '99
Jones 1. home. . .Tucker,'9B
Robinson.. . .r. home .... Clark, '99

Terrill r. center. ..Merritt, '99

Grace r. guard. ..Morley, '97
Mrs. W. E. Magee of the Berke
ley girls' gymnasium, and Ada
Edwards, for Stanford, acted alter
nately as umpire and referee.
When Captain Griswold and Cap
tain McCray tossed a coin to deter
mine their respective goals, Stan
ford won the preference and chose
the south end of the hall. The
teams took their places. Mrs.
Magee threw the ball into the
air, it fell upon a dozen uplifted
hands, and the game was on.
Ella Wing, captain of the Castil
leja team, who was present, gave a
technical report as follows:
"The game opened actively. Mc-
Cray went across the floor with the
ball. Stanford rr.ade a foul in
tackling. This gave Berkeley a
free throw for a goal. The attempt
was unsuccessful. Berkeley fouled
andClark made a goal for Stanford."
At this first good play the
house went wild, and Miss Clark
was cheered to the echo.
"Berkeley fumbled and lost the
ball. Berkeley made another foul, i
Tucker failed to make goal on a j
free throw. Berkeley phowed
strong overhead throwing. McCray
made another run across the floor.!
Berkeley threw wild, and Stanford
gained a slight advantage. Mer
ritt, of Stanford, made a good catch.
Berkeley got the ball and tried
three times for goal and failed, ow
ing to strong Stanford interference
Jones threw goal for Berkeley."

Then time was called for the
first half with the even score of
1-1. During the pause, yell an
swered yell across the hall.
Banners, ribbons, and flow
ers were waved and horns were
blown vigorously, until everything
else was drowned by a rousing
chorus of "Hail, Stanford, Hail."
"The second half was called.
Stanford opened aggressively and
would have made goal but for a
loose basket. Berkeley's interfer
ence was good but she lost by foul
ing and tackling. Stanford showed
quicker playing, better catching,
and stronger center. Berkeley
made her third foul, and Tucker
threw goal for Stanford.
Stanford fouled Berkeley and
Brownsill was given a free throw.
She failed to make goal."
When time was called for the
last half the ball was near the cen
ter of the floor and the score stood
2-1 in favor of Stanford.
The Stanford girls gathered up
their caps, which were scattered

about like red carnations, and re
ceived the congratulations of their
rivals, who accepted defeat cheer
fully. The Stanford girls in the
gallery "rooted" vigorously, the
favorite call being "Stella, you're a
darling." The Stanford chant of
victory, written by Londa Steb
bins, '98, given below, rang out
with tremendous enthusiasm.
The favorers of Berkeley, nothing
daunted, replied with their yell.
Everywhere was good-natured and
favorable comment, and only ap
preciative words from winners or
losers.
Because the Stanford girls were
reckless players and unused to
breaking a fall on a hard floor, it
was greatly feared some one might
be injured. But, on the contrary,
no one received so much as a
scratch during the game. The
girls entered the contest with true
athletic spirit. Stanford won
fairly because of her agility, speed,
and clever team-work. California
admitted herself honestly defeated,
and the girls parted good friends.
The team was chaperoned to and
from the city, and returned on the

eight o'clock train. The news of
the victory had already been re
ceived on the campus and the En
cina boys came pouring from their
rooms, soon filling the corridors
with a laughing, cheering crowd.
They went to the station to meet
the team. Girls, too, were on hand
an hour before the train was due,
and the crowd passed the time
singing college songs, the favorite
being an adaptation to the tune of
"Bingo," which ran, "Here's to
Captain Stella, for she's a jolly
fellow." An omnibus engaged to
carry the team was covered with
Hags and cardinal bunting. The
trip from the station to the campus
was an ovation. The lioble girls
captured Miss Morley and carried
heron their shoulders to a room on
the second floor which was made
red from floor to ceiling for the
occasion. There, mounted on a
trunk draped in cardinal, Miss
Morley was forced to give the de
tails of the game.
As a reward of their prowess the
victorious team demanded the big
white U S." Because they had not
arranged the meet through the
Athletic Committee, technicalities
stood in the way, but so great was
the enthusiasm and appreciation
upon the campus, that the Execu
tive Committee of the student body
everlooked mere formality and
granted the insignia. These nine
are the first and as yet the only
girls to win and wear rightfully the
Varsity "S."
