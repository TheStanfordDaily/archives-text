# Buchtel Freshmen.

### 
The upper-classmen of Buchtel
College have the custom of making
the freshman class, upon its entry,
feel its inexperience by an initia
tion of the whole class before grant
ing it the right of participating in
college activities. Since Buchtel is
one of Ohio's many small colleges,
such an undertaking is pos
sible.
J n the early part of the year, the
freshmen are summarily ordered
to make their appearance at the
gymnasium, where they are receiv
ed by vvierd and awe-inspiring at
tendants who see that they reach a
sufficiently humble and respect
ful state of mind and put into
practise their vows of subordination
to upper-classmen. Other ordeals
are yet to be suffered during these
first few weeks, such as color-rushes,
etc. If the freshmen are too feeble,
they have the right of appeal to
the juniors, but never to the seniors.
To the last, sophomores are their
deadly foes. Class divisions are as
a result a strong factor in the col
lege life. Even the professors seem
to join the conspiracy, the first year
being generally conceded to be
the most rigorous in respect to as
signments and requirements.
