## WOMEN AND ATHLETICS. Review of Past and Present Organizations What They Have Accomplished. 
### 
In the early days of the Univer
sity Stanford women took a wider
interest in athletics than during
the past few years. In mentioning
the topic the Woman's Edition of
The Daily Palo Alto, published
on December 10, 1897, says:
"The athletic interests of the
women students at Stanford are
controlled by the Woman's Athletic
Association, which is governed by
a constitution granted it by the
student body.
"This Association is directly gov
erned by a board of directors which
consists of a president, a vice-presi
dent, a secretary, a treasurer, a
representative from each class and
one from the specials, and one mem
ber from the women of the faculty.
The interests are divided among
five clubs: tennis, basket-ball,
archery, pedestrian, and bicycling.
The three former are comparatively
well equipped ; all hold more or
less regular meets, games or tourna
ments. Asemi-annual tennis tourna
ment is held for the possession of
a handsome silver cup, while the
archers compete for a trophy pin
in the shape of a golden arrow.
Although the Varsity basket-ball
team plays an occasional game
with another college or preparatory
school, yet in basket-ball as in all
contests, the main objects are the
physical development and the
pleasure of the contestants.
"Membership in the Association
is open to all women who are stu
dents in the University, or are
members of the family of one of the
Stanford faculty. The Association
dues are twenty-five cents a semes
ter."
Suggestion and encouragement
that finally resulted in the forma
tion of the Woman's Athletic Asso
ciation came from Dr. Wood, who
in February, 1893, addressed the
women students upon the subject.
In October of the next college year
the organization was finally com
pleted, and officers elected. Mabel
Holsclaw, '96, was the first presi
dent. N. S. Ayers, who had just
finished a special course under An
na Payson Call, at Wellesley, was
at that time in charge of the Roble
Gymnasium, with Clelia D. Mosh
er, '93, as Assistant in Hygiene.
Everything favored women's ath
letics. Iloble Gymnasium was
provided with a number of good
courts, and they were kept in con
dition. The Association formed
clubs devoted to special branches
of its activities.
The Tennis Club was strong from
the beginning. During the first
semester of 1894 a classification
tournament was held, the first in
the history of the University. There
were twelve entries. Upon the re
sults of that tournament was based
the continuous tournament of the
second semester. Anna Martin,
'96, Ida Williams, '99, Mary Web
ster, '97, and Stella Rose, '99, held
first places during the year. In
May a University tournament was
held, and Anna Martin won the
championship in ladies' singles.
The year following the club pur
chased a silver trophy cup, the
funds for which were raised partly
by entrance fees to the tournament
and partly by the subscriptions of

interested friends. The cup was
played for each semester, and re
mained in the position of the win
ning student until taken from her
at the next tournament. The name
of each holder was engraved on the
cup, which still remains in Roble
Gymnasium. The list of champions
is as follows: Anna Martin, '94-'95,
Mary Webster, '96, Stella McCray,
'97, Stella Rose, '97-'9B, Mary
Hodge, '01, '03.
Basket-ball was a new game,
having been invented but four years
before the Stanford club took it up.
The first match on the Pacific Coast
was that played in 1893 between
Miss Lake's and Miss West's
schools. The Stanford Rasket-Ball
Club worked enthusiastically. They
had a coach and played match
games with Castilleja. They were
at first defeated by that prepara
tory school, but in the next contest
won, 4-0, and thereupon followed
the challenge to Berkeley. The
first intercollegiate basket-ball
game was that between Stanford
and Berkeley, on April 4, 189G,
which Stanford won, 2-1.
The Archery Club was organized
on November 15, 1894. One of
the most earnest advocates of the
sport was Professor Nathan Abbott,
who addressed the women interest
ed in the subject and made sugges
tions which resulted in the forma
tion of the club. Professor Allar
dice was also instrumental in its
success. The organization was
made as flexible as possible, with
little red tape. Winifred Harper,
'96, was the first president; Alma
Patterson, '00, the first manager.
Mr. and Mrs. Havens,of Oakland,ex
pert archers, generously offered to in
struct the girls, and invited the club
to Rose Crest Range, one of the finest
on the Coast, an invitation which
as many as possible accepted dur
ing the Thanksgiving vacation of
that year. Enough interest devel
oped to warrant laying out a range
near the Roble Gymnasium. A
36-inch target was set up. Bows
and arrows were furnished by the
Association. The golden arrow,
which was offered as a trophy to
the champion by Mrs. Jordan, is
still at Roble Gymnasium.
At the time the other clubs
were formed, r a Walking Club was
organized, but amounted to little.
The Bicycle Club organized in
Roble parlors on November 15,
1894. A constitution and by-laws
were adopted. Ellen Thompson
was the first captain, and Wini
fred Harper, '96, the first lieuten
ant. Cardinal and silver were
chosen the club colors. Daily runs
were planned, to leave Roble Gym
nasium at eight on Saturday morn
ings, and the front entrance of the
Quad at four in the afternoon on
other days.
In addition to these activities,
there was a Roble Boating Club.
Such an organization was suggested
in an open letter published in The
Daily Palo Alto on February 15,
1893. The club was formed during
the first semester of 1894, and
launched its four-oared flat-bot
tomed row-boat on Lagunita in
February of the same year, amid
characteristic ceremonies conducted
by Misses Edwards, Lewis, and
Hill. The boat was christened
"Freyja," and its first crew consist
ed of Wynn Coman, ex-'97, cap
tain, Lena Polhemus, ex-'97, Lucia
Lay, '95, Grace Baker, '03, and

Stella Rose, '99. Those were the
days when the Stanford Boat Club
was rowing and racing on Lagu
nita, with future prospects that were
big and bright.
