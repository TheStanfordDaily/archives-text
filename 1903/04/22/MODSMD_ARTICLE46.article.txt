### 
Roble Gymnasium Club organiz
ed last semester. The object of the
club is to promote interest in gym
nastics among University women
and give club members opportunity
for advanced work. Any woman
student in Roble Gymnasium who
is in good physical condition and
has had sufficient training in gym
nastics is eligible to active mem
bership. We have already reached
the constitutional limit of twenty
members, with a long waiting list.
The instructors this year are
Dr. Snow, head of the Hygiene de
partment, Mr. H. W. Chappel, '01,
and Mr. R. R. Long, '05, directors
of Encina Gymnasium.

Tennis,
After the tournament for the pos
session of the Association cup in
1898, interest in tennis flagged. In
1901 a few girls, inspired by Mrs.
James P.Hall,herself an enthusias
tic player, renewed for several weeks
in the spring the customary con
tinuous tournaments, and Mary
Hodge, '03, won the cup for that
year. Then interest lapsed again.
Toward the close of the college
year '01-'O2 the Tennis Club re
ceived a challenge from Berkeley,
but it came too late to act upon.
When this year it was repeated
in good season the Stanford girls
accepted with genuine and working
enthusiasm.
With the intercollegiate meet in
view they organized a tennis squad
of fourteen, and elected Mary
Hodge, '03, captain, and Elizabeth
Peckham, '03, manager. The squad
was under the direction of Roble
Gymnasium, and found in Miss
Stella Rose, '99, the director, a
sympathetic counsellor. The Tennis
Committee of the Woman's Ath
letic Association worked with the
squad, and all entered upon the
season with a will.
The squad went into training;
the rules were simple and merely
insured the girls a wholesome, ra
tional life. The players were al
lowed to substitute tennis for the
regular gymnasium work twice a
week, and on the third of the regu
lar gymnasium days were given
excercises to specially fit them for
tennis. Dr. Snow examined the
girls before admitting them to the
squad, and watched them carefully
throughout the season.
The contest with California,
which was the first intercollegiate
tennis in the history of the Univer
sity, and the first intercollegiate
match of any sort between the
women since 1896, was played on
the Roble courts on the morning of
April 11th, 1903. The tournament
was decided by matches, and Stan
ford won, 2 to 1.
The game between Mary Hend
rick, '03, Stanford, and Ethel
Wickson, California, began prompt
ly at nine. The players were
evenly matched, but Stanford
forged ahead. On the side-lines
the enthusiasm was divided be
tween regard for Miss Hendrick's
clever work and admiration for
Miss Wickson's fine spirit. Miss

, Hendrick won the match, 8-6,
6-1.
The next couple to contend was
Mabel Kay, '05, Stanford, and Miss
Weeks, California. Every point
was applauded, but the enthusiasm
of the friends of both was at its
I height as the two girls shook hands
over the net, with the score, 6-1,
6-2, in favor of Stanford. The
day was decided.
Mary Hodge, '03, the Stanford
champion, was matched against
the California champion, Ethel
Ratcliffe. The play was faster and
harder than in the preceding
games, and the Stanford girl lost
rapidly. Miss Ratcliffe was cool,
and seemed untiring. The score
was finally 6-0, 6-2, in favor of
California.
There is now a real interest in
girls' tennis throughout the Uni
versity in general. The squad will
not disband but will remain the
nucleus for an even wider enthusi
asm among the women for the
! splendid sport.
The victory in intercollegiate
tennis was won under great disad
vantage in the matter of courts.
It is hoped that next year's squad
may have at least one good court
provided. Certainly women's ten
nis has earned a place among
; recognized University athletics.
Basket-Bail.
This semester, for the first time
in several years, the women of
Stanford have an organized basket
ball squad. The girls interested
in the game had some practise last
semester, and early in the spring
the basket-ball committee of the
Woman's Athletic Association
chose a squad, of the following
girls: Beeger, '06, Betz, '06, Gil
bert, '06, E. Hayward, '06, S.
Hyatt, '06, E. Miller, '06, Moore,
'04, Park, '04, Pitman, '05, Rich
ards, '05, Ray, '05, Salisbury, '05,
Spalding, '06, A. Spencer, '06, and
Timmons, '06, who organized and
adopted a few simple training rules.
Although Stanford girls are not
permitted to play match games
with outside teams, they practise
among themselves, and occasion
ally play quiet practise games with
neighboring teams. These games do
much towards increasing the inter
est of the players, and also give
them a chance to meet worthy op
ponents.
The Stanford team has identified
itself with the "Woman's Basket
ball League of the West," an or
ganization started at Berkeley in
the fall of 1902 for the purpose of
promoting basket-ball among the
women of the Coast. To the league
belong the teams from the Univer
sity of California, University of
Nevada, Mills, Alameda High
School, Stockton High School, the
San Francisco Y. M. C. A., and
Stanford. All the teams but that of
Stanford are now playing in a tour
nament of league games, the winner
to be champion of the league. The
rules observed are the Smith College
Rules for Women, slightly modi
fied by the board of directors of the
league.
There is good material in the
Stanford basket-ball squad, a
hearty enthusiasm for the game,
and a willingness to work, a com
bination that promises well for the
future.
Helen M. Salisbury, '05,
Captain.
