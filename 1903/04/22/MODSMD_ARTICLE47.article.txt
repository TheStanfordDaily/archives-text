" Capitola by the seaside,
Capitola by the sea,
Where the dancing waves are
singing welcome,
To Capitola by the sea."
To every Capitola girl, the strains
of this familiar song bring a train
of half-tender, half-jolly memories.
To anyone who has ever been there,
there is no need of praising Capi
tola. To others it may be of inter
est to hear something of the ten
days that over three hundred and
fifty college girls spend there every
summer.
The Pacific Coast Conference for
young women is only one of the
several conferences held annually
in various parts of the United States
under the auspices of the Young
Women's Christian Association.
These are attended by hundreds of
young American women who can
not be too enthusiastic over an As
sociation Conference. Our Pacific
Coast Conference is held from May
fifteenth to May twenty-sixth at
Capitola, a summer resort four
miles from Santa Cruz.
The large hotel, which is turned
over entirely to the Conference dele
gates, is at the very edge of the
ocean, and has at its rear high cliffs
on one side and a beautiful creek
and glen on the other. In this de
lightful spot gather together girls—
either Association members or other
wise — from Oregon, Washington,
Idaho, Nevada, and California, to
spend what many of them have
called the best ten days of their
life.
College rivalries are forgotten,
and girls from Berkeley and Stan
ford, University of Nevada and
Pomona, join together for fun or
for the serious part with a true
esprit de corps. A Berkeley girl
was even heard to remark: "Why,
the Stanford girls are really nice,
aren't they?" Besides the pleasure
of meeting girls from other colleges,
we have the opportunity of getting
belter acquainted with those of our
own delegation. A Stanford girl
has said that she got better ac
quainted with her associate delegates
in those ten days than in a whole
year at college.
The object of the Conference is
"to deepen the spiritual life of the
women students, to train them to
lead the organized Christian work
of their institutions, and to help
them to make their lives count for
most for the kingdom of God after
leaving college." All these things
it does to a wonderful degree.
One of the most delightful and
memorable features of theConference
is the contact with such splendid
women as the secretaries, Miss
Taylor, Miss Cond6, and Miss
Dunn, and the opportunity we have
to really know them and to talk to
them about anything we choose.
When one has seen these woman,
she realizes that this is not a slight
thing in itself.
These secretaries procure some of
the best speakers and Bible teach
ers in the country. Last year Dr.
Charles R. Brown was one of the
speakers. This year we are to have
Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman, Mrs. John
R. Mott, Miss Mary Hill Madras,
Miss Taylor, Miss Cond6, Miss
Reynolds, Miss Dunn, and perhaps
Dr. W. W. White. These take up
most of the morning with practical
methods of Association work, a
Bible-study hour, and addresses on
various subjects. Every girl is at
liberty to stay away from anything
whenever she chooses, but several
who have declared that they weren't

"going to meetings all the time"
have concluded that there was
nothing they could afford to miss.
The whole afternoon is given
over to recreation and rest, and al
most any hour from one until six
girls may be seen climbing on the
rocks, bathing, wading in the creek,
sailing, rowing, playing tennis,
sunning themselves on the beach,
or swinging in the squeaky old
swings on the sand. Then there is
the drive to the big trees, and trips
to Monterey and Santa Cruz. For
an hour after dinner one has noth
ing to do but gather shells on the
beach, or sit on the rocks and
watch the spray from the huge
breakers. Then there is the eve
ning address, after which the girls
usually gather in their own delega
tion-rooms for their good night
talk, and then perhaps bed, per
haps a midnight parade, or a
spread.
In speaking of the fun, one
thinks first almost instinctively
of the glen on College Day, of
the college pennants and brilliant
costumes, of the songs and yells
and "stunts." We have said that
college rivalries are laid aside at
Capitola, but this is the exception.
On this one day last year ninety
girls appeared in gold and blue,
and forty-five in cardinal. Each
delegation tried to yell the loudest
and sing the best, and said noth
ing of the secret practises it had had
in the glen after dinner.
But the climax of good times is
not on College Day. It comes in
the shape of a farewell banquet on
the very last night. Then every
body forgets that she has to go
away the next day, and enjoys
with her whole heart the toasts and
songs and good things to eat.
But after all, it is not the fun at
Capitola that one remembers most
lovingly. It is what one gets
to take away—"inspiration for a
whole year," someone has called it.
It is impossible to describe Capi
tola in any adequate way. Many
girls last year exclaimed : "Why
didn't you tell me that it was like
this. I wish I had come earlier!"
In the language of an old Capitola
girl, "One must have been there to
realize."
" Capitola by the seaside,
Capitola by the sea,
Where the dancing waves are
singing welcome,
To Capitola by the sea."

and sing the best, and said noth
ing of the secret practises it had had
in the glen after dinner.
But the climax of good times is
not on College Day. It comes in
the shape of a farewell banquet on
the very last night. Then every
body forgets that she has to go
away the next day, and enjoys
with her whole heart the toasts and
songs and good things to eat.
But after all, it is not the fun at
Capitola that one remembers most
lovingly. It is what one gets
to take away—"inspiration for a
whole year," someone has called it.
It is impossible to describe Capi
tola in any adequate way. Many
girls last year exclaimed : "Why
didn't you tell me that it was like
this. I wish I had come earlier!"
In the language of an old Capitola
girl, "One must have been there to
realize."
" Capitola by the seaside,
Capitola by the sea,
Where the dancing waves are
singing welcome,
To Capitola by the sea."
To every Capitola girl, the strains
of this familiar song bring a train
of half-tender, half-jolly memories.
To anyone who has ever been there,
there is no need of praising Capi
tola. To others it may be of inter
est to hear something of the ten
days that over three hundred and
fifty college girls spend there every
summer.
The Pacific Coast Conference for
young women is only one of the
several conferences held annually
in various parts of the United States
under the auspices of the Young
Women's Christian Association.
These are attended by hundreds of
young American women who can
not be too enthusiastic over an As
sociation Conference. Our Pacific
Coast Conference is held from May
fifteenth to May twenty-sixth at
Capitola, a summer resort four
miles from Santa Cruz.
The large hotel, which is turned
over entirely to the Conference dele
gates, is at the very edge of the
ocean, and has at its rear high cliffs
on one side and a beautiful creek
and glen on the other. In this de
lightful spot gather together girls—
either Association members or other
wise — from Oregon, Washington,
Idaho, Nevada, and California, to
spend what many of them have
called the best ten days of their
life.
College rivalries are forgotten,
and girls from Berkeley and Stan
ford, University of Nevada and
Pomona, join together for fun or
for the serious part with a true
esprit de corps. A Berkeley girl
was even heard to remark: "Why,
the Stanford girls are really nice,
aren't they?" Besides the pleasure
of meeting girls from other colleges,
we have the opportunity of getting
belter acquainted with those of our
own delegation. A Stanford girl
has said that she got better ac
quainted with her associate delegates
in those ten days than in a whole
year at college.
The object of the Conference is
"to deepen the spiritual life of the
women students, to train them to
lead the organized Christian work
of their institutions, and to help
them to make their lives count for
most for the kingdom of God after
leaving college." All these things
it does to a wonderful degree.
One of the most delightful and
memorable features of theConference
is the contact with such splendid
women as the secretaries, Miss
Taylor, Miss Cond6, and Miss
Dunn, and the opportunity we have
to really know them and to talk to
them about anything we choose.
When one has seen these woman,
she realizes that this is not a slight
thing in itself.
These secretaries procure some of
the best speakers and Bible teach
ers in the country. Last year Dr.
Charles R. Brown was one of the
speakers. This year we are to have
Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman, Mrs. John
R. Mott, Miss Mary Hill Madras,
Miss Taylor, Miss Cond6, Miss
Reynolds, Miss Dunn, and perhaps
Dr. W. W. White. These take up
most of the morning with practical
methods of Association work, a
Bible-study hour, and addresses on
various subjects. Every girl is at
liberty to stay away from anything
whenever she chooses, but several
who have declared that they weren't

"going to meetings all the time"
have concluded that there was
nothing they could afford to miss.
The whole afternoon is given
over to recreation and rest, and al
most any hour from one until six
girls may be seen climbing on the
rocks, bathing, wading in the creek,
sailing, rowing, playing tennis,
sunning themselves on the beach,
or swinging in the squeaky old
swings on the sand. Then there is
the drive to the big trees, and trips
to Monterey and Santa Cruz. For
an hour after dinner one has noth
ing to do but gather shells on the
beach, or sit on the rocks and
watch the spray from the huge
breakers. Then there is the eve
ning address, after which the girls
usually gather in their own delega
tion-rooms for their good night
talk, and then perhaps bed, per
haps a midnight parade, or a
spread.
In speaking of the fun, one
thinks first almost instinctively
of the glen on College Day, of
the college pennants and brilliant
costumes, of the songs and yells
and "stunts." We have said that
college rivalries are laid aside at
Capitola, but this is the exception.
On this one day last year ninety
girls appeared in gold and blue,
and forty-five in cardinal. Each
delegation tried to yell the loudest
and sing the best, and said noth
ing of the secret practises it had had
in the glen after dinner.
But the climax of good times is
not on College Day. It comes in
the shape of a farewell banquet on
the very last night. Then every
body forgets that she has to go
away the next day, and enjoys
with her whole heart the toasts and
songs and good things to eat.
