# How Roble Received the News.
## 
### 
On Saturday, April 18, 1903,
Stanford won the eleventh Inter
collegiate Field-day. A girl who had
received a telegram announced the
score to the Roble girls just as they
were assembling in the parlor for
the usual after-dinner dance. In
stantly pandemonium broke loose.
Every girl present opened her
mouth and yelled.
No sooner had the noise reached
the upper halls than more girls
came running down. They brought
with them horns, megaphones and
tambourines, and the uproar in
creased. The girl at the piano
played "The Dutch Company," and
the whole room took up the chorus:
"O Berkeley, O Berkeley,
You don't amount to much!"
Two or three, in lock step, began
marching around the parlor. Others
joined the line, until the hundred
girls, singing their loudest, were
circling round and round; faster
and faster the line flew until it dis
solved from sheer exhaustion.
Our only post-graduate, forget
ting dignity, mounted the center
table, and madly waving a red
megaphone, demanded: "Will
somebody please give me the par
ticulars?"
Cries of "We won! We won!"
and then the score yelled at the top
of a hundred voices was the only
response. In a far corner one lone
girl, standing on a sofa, was
solemnly waving a cardinal bath
robe up and down. In another
place a popular senior was gesticul
ating earnestly and pleading for
an organized yell. A group formed
around her, eager for instructions.
"Voices low, voices low," she com
manded, "and everybody give the
Varsity." Roble responded nobly.
Encouraged by the result they
tried the"L. S. J. U." and then
gave three for the team and an
other three for Dad Moulton. The
girl with the telegram asserted that
the day was decided by the pole
vaulters, and a sky-rocket was
given for them.
The room seemed too small for the
enthusiasm, and following the lead
of others, the girls rushed out upon
the oval in front of the Hall. They
did the serpentine around the
circle until compelled to stop from
lack of breath. Some one suggested
a bonfire, and in a second they
were scurrying for the Quad. They
came back with barrels and boards
and boxes taken from the piles of
building material. A can of seal
oil appeared from mysterious hid
ing, and this poured on the wood
made a quick blaze. The fire shot
up, painting red the whole front of
Roble, and lighting up the Chem
istry building and the top of the
great arch. The girls joined hands
and danced about, singing as they
went. They repeated the yells,
and suddenly remembering the
hour, gave a rousing three for the
debating team.
In a moment's pause for breath
distant sounds were heard, and
someone announced the Encina
parade. The girls ran for the
Roble steps and waited there.
Some voice started it, and the whole
crowd was singing
"0 Berkeley, O Berkeley,"
with an attempt at melody, when
the little line of twenty-five, nearly
all the Encina men on the Cam
pus at the time, came marching
down the walk. At the head of
the line one man was dolefully
beating a muffled drum; behind him

came the procession bearing a bier
and a sheeted figure. They set it
down in front of the Hall and con-'
ducted California's funeral exer
cises, while the girls on the steps
applauded. They then took up the
bier and marching around the circle
burned the year's hoodoo on the
Roble bonfire.
The girls in chorus inquired who
won the events. The answer came
quick and clear: "We don't know
and we don't care!" Then every
body cheered.
The bonfire was kept going for
three hours. The girls sat on the
steps and sang. To vary the pro
gram they chanted the score: "One
two-three-four-five," the enthusiasm
increasing as the number grew, till
it finished in a fine burst, "sixty-!
three and a third! and a third!"
Twice during the evening the |
Encina parade marched by, bring
ing barrels and boxes to replenish
the bonfire. The Haines danced
high, spreading the glow until the
whole night was colored red.
