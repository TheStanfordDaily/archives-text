# MRS. STANFORD TO THE WOMEN OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
## 
### 
I would have each one of my girls remember that she
exerts an influence extend nig far beyond her conception
and I pray that it will be for good always; and I would
have her realize she can use it for the good of her Uni
versity in a constant endeavor to uphold the Stanford
standard of honesty, sincerity, and truth in all things.
This is her duty, and / would hare her meet it seriously
and willnigly. I would have the Stanford girl be
womanly in the highest, sweetest sense of the word. T
would have her enjoy to the fullest her equal privileges
here with gentle womanly dignity, respecting herself and
making all with whom she comes in contact respect her.

Finally,((hove all else, I would have her go out into the
world a noble, Christian woman, who will stand for
something serious in life and always he a credit to Stanford.
What is more pitiful than to meet a highly educated cultured
hoy or girl, man or woman, who is utterly devoid of any sense
of obligation to an all-wise Heavenly Father for the
many blessings bestowed upon the children of earth. Que
and all of us have been grieved by the assertion in public
print that Stanford University is a "Godless institution
therefore I beseech you one and all to so live and act
your part in life that you will be known as lovers of
Christ and of the, greatest of all teachers —our precious
Saviour.
