# Association of Collegiate Alumnae
## 
### Marion Adams, '98 
Marion Adams graduated from Stan
ford in 1898. She was associate editor
on The Daily Palo Alto and editor-in
chief of the first Woman's Edition,
which appeared on December 10, 1897.
Miss Adams is now Recording Secretary
for the California Branch of the Associa
tion of Collegiate Alumnae.—Ed.
Although the Association of Col
legiate Alumnae is a national insti
tution, to the students of our local
colleges it stands chiefly for what
it is in this State. We speak of
ourselves ordinarily as a "club,"
which sounds less pretentious than
"association," from which, usually,
something profound is expected.
Our primary purpose, as a local
club, is to enjoy ourselves and each
other, although we do occasionally
engage in serious work.
Our members at present number
three hundred and five, and of this
membership we are justly proud,
for within a year our list has more
than doubled. Among our mem
bers are to be found women gradu
ates of fourteen of the leading col
leges in the United States, namely:
Boston, Bryn Mawr, California,
Cornell, Michigan, Minnesota, Ne
braska, Northwestern, Oberlin,
Stanford, Smith, Vassar, Wellesley,
and Wisconsin.
We are constantly asked, "What
do you do?" We must plead guilty
to not "doing" very much. We
are a club of busy women, who for
the most part have but little time
for club work. But the desire of
the college woman to hear about
her Alma Mater and meet again
her friends of the old days is shown
by the large attendance at our jolly
luncheons and other club meetings.
Then, out of respect to our more
serious minded members, we some
times grow grave and listen with
interest to lectures of note upon
subjects of general or special inter
est; and once in a while one of our
work committees (for we have
them) has been up and doing, and
we are entertained and instructed
by accounts of their ventures into
the world. In this way we are
kept in touch with the active work
of the club.
We have a number of committees,
among which are: The Social
Settlement Committee, which seeks
to interest our talented members in
the opportunities for work in San
Francisco and neighboring com
munities; the Home Economics
Committee, which promises us in
the near future a complete biblio
graphy of "home economic" litera
ture; a Tea Room Committee, which
has recently established a club
room in the shopping district of
this city for the convenience of
members and their friends; a
Charities Committee, which is at
present working with a committee
representing the Associated Chari
ties of San Francisco on a study of
dependent children; an Education
al Committee, just now interested
in the subject of the use made by
public schools of public libraries;
and a Child Labor Committee, the
chairman of which was actively in
terested in the recent child labor
bills before our State legislature.
We were also able to assist a
worthy cause when we took the
lead in getting up a mass meeting
for Booker T. Washington this
year at his request. In fact we
find plenty of work to do when we
are in the mood to do it.
One feature of the past year's
work appeals especially, I believe,
to most of our members. It is the
establishment of the tea-room al
ready mentioned. To say nothing
of the social possibilities of such a

room, most of us as undergraduates
who did not have homes in San
Francisco, have many times felt
the need of a place to leave our
bundles, to catch a few moments
rest, or snatch a light refreshment
during the busy day or afternoon
in town. This need, we trust, is to
be supplied in the tea-room, and
by many of us it is hoped that in
the near future the privileges of the
room now open to seniors and
juniors upon payment of the regu
lar membership fee, may be ex
tended free of charge to all women
undergraduates of both our univer
sities. And it is even hinted that
perhaps a club-house may be the
ultimate result of the movement.
Aside from the pleasure that we
get individually from our club, we
are also members of a great nation
al organization, the avowed aim of
which is to further practical edu
cational work. This organization
supports a scholarship of five hun
dred dollars for advanced study
abroad. It also receives from Mrs.
M. B. Willard, and from Dr. Hem
pel, a scholarship each year, pro
viding for residence and tuition
in the American Home School in
Berlin. Its council accredits
women students who desire to pur
sue higher university work in
Europe.
Socially, also, the national organ
ization offers something to its
members. Membership is a sufli
cient introduction to a congenial
circle of friends in any of the fol
lowing cities, where local branches
are situated: Washington, New
York, San Francisco, Philadelphia,
Boston, Syracuse, Minneapolis and
St. Paul, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo,
Indianapolis, Albany, Cleveland,
Providence, New Haven, Kansas
City, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Milwa
ukee, and Denver. This alone
would seem to justify the existence
of the association.

it is in this State. We speak of
ourselves ordinarily as a "club,"
which sounds less pretentious than
"association," from which, usually,
something profound is expected.
Our primary purpose, as a local
club, is to enjoy ourselves and each
other, although we do occasionally
engage in serious work.
Our members at present number
three hundred and five, and of this
membership we are justly proud,
for within a year our list has more
than doubled. Among our mem
bers are to be found women gradu
ates of fourteen of the leading col
leges in the United States, namely:
Boston, Bryn Mawr, California,
Cornell, Michigan, Minnesota, Ne
braska, Northwestern, Oberlin,
Stanford, Smith, Vassar, Wellesley,
and Wisconsin.
We are constantly asked, "What
do you do?" We must plead guilty
to not "doing" very much. We
are a club of busy women, who for
the most part have but little time
for club work. But the desire of
the college woman to hear about
her Alma Mater and meet again
her friends of the old days is shown
by the large attendance at our jolly
luncheons and other club meetings.
Then, out of respect to our more
serious minded members, we some
times grow grave and listen with
interest to lectures of note upon
subjects of general or special inter
est; and once in a while one of our
work committees (for we have
them) has been up and doing, and
we are entertained and instructed
by accounts of their ventures into
the world. In this way we are
kept in touch with the active work
of the club.
We have a number of committees,
among which are: The Social
Settlement Committee, which seeks
to interest our talented members in
the opportunities for work in San
Francisco and neighboring com
munities; the Home Economics
Committee, which promises us in
the near future a complete biblio
graphy of "home economic" litera
ture; a Tea Room Committee, which
has recently established a club
room in the shopping district of
this city for the convenience of
members and their friends; a
Charities Committee, which is at
present working with a committee
representing the Associated Chari
ties of San Francisco on a study of
dependent children; an Education
al Committee, just now interested
in the subject of the use made by
public schools of public libraries;
and a Child Labor Committee, the
chairman of which was actively in
terested in the recent child labor
bills before our State legislature.
We were also able to assist a
worthy cause when we took the
lead in getting up a mass meeting
for Booker T. Washington this
year at his request. In fact we
find plenty of work to do when we
are in the mood to do it.
One feature of the past year's
work appeals especially, I believe,
to most of our members. It is the
establishment of the tea-room al
ready mentioned. To say nothing
of the social possibilities of such a

room, most of us as undergraduates
who did not have homes in San
Francisco, have many times felt
the need of a place to leave our
bundles, to catch a few moments
rest, or snatch a light refreshment
during the busy day or afternoon
in town. This need, we trust, is to
be supplied in the tea-room, and
by many of us it is hoped that in
the near future the privileges of the
room now open to seniors and
juniors upon payment of the regu
lar membership fee, may be ex
tended free of charge to all women
undergraduates of both our univer
sities. And it is even hinted that
perhaps a club-house may be the
ultimate result of the movement.
Aside from the pleasure that we
get individually from our club, we
are also members of a great nation
al organization, the avowed aim of
which is to further practical edu
cational work. This organization
supports a scholarship of five hun
dred dollars for advanced study
abroad. It also receives from Mrs.
M. B. Willard, and from Dr. Hem
pel, a scholarship each year, pro
viding for residence and tuition
in the American Home School in
Berlin. Its council accredits
women students who desire to pur
sue higher university work in
Europe.
Socially, also, the national organ
ization offers something to its
members. Membership is a sufli
cient introduction to a congenial
circle of friends in any of the fol
lowing cities, where local branches
are situated: Washington, New
York, San Francisco, Philadelphia,
Boston, Syracuse, Minneapolis and
St. Paul, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo,
Indianapolis, Albany, Cleveland,
Providence, New Haven, Kansas
City, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Milwa
ukee, and Denver. This alone
would seem to justify the existence
of the association.
