The University Register for
1902-3 has just been issued from the
press. In appearance and general
arrangement it does not differ from
the Register of the previous year.
The new edition contains 232 pages,
an increase of 21 over that of the
previous year. The catalogue of
students shows 1483, the largest
number in the history of the Uni
versity, and 188 more than last year.
These students are classified as fol
lows: in graduate standing, 119;
undergraduates, 1161; special stu
dents, 203. Ab a new feature of the
Register is a five-page directory of
oflicers at the end of the book, being
an aphabetical list with title, resi
dence, post-ollice, and a reference
to the Register page where addi
tional information may be found.
The change of the most immedi
ate interest to the student is that
in the Calendar for next year. The
University year will begin a week
earlier than heretofore, Friday,
August 21st, being the first entranee
examination date. Matriculated
students will register Tuesday
and Wednesday, August 25th and
26th. New students will register
also Wednesday (August 26th)
instead of the day following the reg
istration of old students. Instruct
ion is to begin Thursday, August
27th. In this connection, another
change of importance to the student
is the regulation regarding filing of
study-cards (page 59j. Heretofore
a period of ten days has been al
lowed after registration day. lie
ginning next August, study-cards
must be filed not later than the
Friday following registration day.
Late study-cards will be accepted
upon payment of the usual fee of
$2.00, and late registration of ma
triculated students will be permitted
during registration week upon pay
ing the usual tine of $2.00. Stu
dents delaying registration beyond
registration week will pay a tine of
$4.00. In this way it is hoped that
the bulk of the study-cards will*be
filed on registration day or the day
following, and that the fall work of
the University wiil begin without
any delay. Commencement in 1904
will come on May 18, a week earlier
than at present.
The Register records the following
promotions in the Faculty: to be
Associate Professors — Assistant
Professors Heath, Miller, and Rieb
er; to be Assistant Professors—ln
structors Elmore, Snyder, Swain,
Snedden, Noyes; to be Instructors—
Assistants Allin, Lawson, Martin,
Manning, and Abrams. The new
members of the Faculty since the
publication of last year's Register
are: The Rev. It. Heher Newton,
I). I)., the Rev. 1). Charles Gard
ner; Associate Profe°sor Franklin;
Assistant Professors Blair, Millis,
and Noyes; Instructors Snodgrass,
Cooke, Clarke, Cleveland, Chappel,
Rose, Bolton, Liggett, Lyon, Can
non, and Suzzallo; Assistants Lord,
Long, Gaither, Fisher, Kalenborn,
Mitchell, James, and Olsson-Seffer.
Entrance fees remain without
change as in last year's Register.
The abolition of all May entrance

examinations except in English, is
noted. Students desiring to take
their entrance examinations at that
time of the year are advised to try
the June examinations of the Col
lege Entrance Board which will he
held at Belmont and San Mateo.
In regard to admission of students
without examination from certain
Japanese schools the, provision has
been inserted that "before admis
sion to the University such candi
dates must pass an examination
showing ability to use and to un
derstand readily both written and
spoken English."
Hereafter the student acceptably
recommended in both 17a and 176
(English Literature) will be re
quired to take an oral examination
in 17b only.
The old " Teachers' Bureau" dis
appears from the new Register, and
is replaced by the Faculty Com
mittee on the Recommendation of
Teachers. The same general lines
will be followed as heretofore, but
the work of the Bureau will be cen
tralized in the interest of greater
efficiency.
Under Courses of Instruction are
noted only the usual variations and
rearrangement. No additional de
partments have been created, and
no particular extension of courses is
announced. The new term "Engi
neering" has been made to cover
subjects common to all of the En
gineering courses, and the var
ious Engineering departments are
grouped as subdivisions of "Engi
neering."
The University Library shows
75,000 volunes, an increase of
12,000 over the previous year.
Under the Hopkins Laboratory
the change is noted by which regu
lar courses of instruction are no
longer planned, provision for ad
vanced students and investigators
only being made.

during registration week upon pay
ing the usual tine of $2.00. Stu
dents delaying registration beyond
registration week will pay a tine of
$4.00. In this way it is hoped that
the bulk of the study-cards will*be
filed on registration day or the day
following, and that the fall work of
the University wiil begin without
any delay. Commencement in 1904
will come on May 18, a week earlier
than at present.

The abolition of all May entrance

examinations except in English, is
noted. Students desiring to take
their entrance examinations at that
time of the year are advised to try
the June examinations of the Col
lege Entrance Board which will he
held at Belmont and San Mateo.
In regard to admission of students
without examination from certain
Japanese schools the, provision has
been inserted that "before admis
sion to the University such candi
dates must pass an examination
showing ability to use and to un
derstand readily both written and
spoken English."
Hereafter the student acceptably
recommended in both 17a and 176

quired to take an oral examination
in 17b only.
The old " Teachers' Bureau" dis
appears from the new Register, and
is replaced by the Faculty Com
mittee on the Recommendation of
Teachers. The same general lines
will be followed as heretofore, but
the work of the Bureau will be cen
tralized in the interest of greater
efficiency.
Under Courses of Instruction are
noted only the usual variations and
rearrangement. No additional de
partments have been created, and
no particular extension of courses is
announced. The new term "Engi
neering" has been made to cover
subjects common to all of the En
gineering courses, and the var
ious Engineering departments are
grouped as subdivisions of "Engi
neering."

75,000 volunes, an increase of
12,000 over the previous year.
Under the Hopkins Laboratory

lar courses of instruction are no
longer planned, provision for ad
vanced students and investigators
only being made.
