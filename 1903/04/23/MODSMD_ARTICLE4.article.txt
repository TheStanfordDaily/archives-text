# WOMAN'S EDITION.
## Special Number of the Daily Filled with Good Articles Meets with Enthusiastic Reception. 
### 
The twenty-page Woman's Edi
tion of the Daily Palo Alto, the
second in the history of the paper,
was put on sale on the quad this
morning. The purpose of the edi
tion, as set forth editorially, is "to
embody in one issue some expres
sion of what the women of Stan
ford have done for their Univer
sity," and to give a message of en
couragement to Stanford girls from
those who as undergraduates or as
alumnae have been numbered
among the capable.
The place of honor is given to an
autograph message from "Mrs.
Stanford to the Women of Stan
ford University," illustrated by a
photogravure. The important news
items are given â€” the rally, Mrs.
Stanford's "at home," student body
nominations, etc. Interesting spe
cial articles tell of "Women Pro
fessors at Stanford," "Capitola,"
and "How Roble Received the
News." Miss Lucile Eaves, '94,
contributes an article on "Stanford
and San Francisco Settlement
Work," Miss Lillian Andrews, ex
' 99, tells of "Associated Charities,"
and Kathryn Romer Kip, '04,
speaks for"The Self-supporting
Girl at Stanford."
A page is devoted to "Girls from
Other Universities," many promi
nent colleges being represented by
former students who are now in
Stanford. Miss Anna Strunsky,
ex-'OO, contributes, "Stanford
Women in the Ranks of Litera
ture," and Miss Sarah Comstock,
'96, now of the San Francisco Call,
gives a sample week "From the
Newspaper Woman's Calendar."
"The Woman's League," "The
Social Situation at Stanford,"
"Brook Farm," "Y. W. C. A." and
"Y. W. C. A. Club" are short arti
cles descriptive of the life of a
Stanford woman.
"Music," "Debating," and "Ath
letics" each occupy a full page.
"The Girls' Mandolin Club,"and
"The Girls' Glee" are the subjects
of two short illustrated articles,
and Prof. Mary Roberts Smith pre
sents a new song, "Stanford in the
Heart." Miss Elizabeth A. Everett,
'03, writes of "The Saturday Night
Club," Miss Antoinette Knowles,
'06, tells "Why Stanford Women
Should Debate," and a special
article gives an account of "Stan
ford Women in Intercollegiate
Debate." Athletic matters receive
full consideration. "Women and
Athletics" reviews the situation,
past and present. "The Roble
Gymnasium Club," "Basket-ball,"
and "Tennis" are discussed, with
an account of the women's Inter
collegiate tennis victory. The first
account of the California-Stanford
basket-ball game of 1896 to appear
in print occupies a page of the
edition, and the victorious Stan
ford team is shown in a photo
graph never before published.
Editorially there is a discussion
of "Stanford Spirit" from the wom
an's point of view, of the future of
college woman, and other matters
of interest to the Stanford woman.
