came to Stanford from the Ukiah
high school with a reputation as a
trackman of unusual merit. In
his freshman year he failed to win
a point, but last year he won second

proved victorious Holman proved
to be no small factor in the result,
as he took first place in the mile

half-mile, winning a total of six
