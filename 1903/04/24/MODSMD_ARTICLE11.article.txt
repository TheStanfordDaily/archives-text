For a number of days students
and members of the faculty have
been looking for and hoping that a
subscription for the typhoid patients
would be taken. At the request of
those who have not this semester
paid the Students' Guild fee, the
rolls will be reopened for member
ship next Monday morning. The
Guild has been doing a great work
in connection with the epidemic
a greater work than any of us who
have not been directly connected
with the sick-rooms and temporary
hospitals established by it can
imagine. The report of the presi
dent of the association does not in
clude the doctors' bills, which will
not be presented until later, and
which when presented will prob
ably amount to a great deal more
thiin all the other expenses put to
gether. The Guild needs money
and needs it bad. It has a large
number of cases on its hands and
not enough money to carry it many
days further. It is time for us to
get together, every student and
member of the faculty, and give
the Guild the financial backing it
deserves.
