An announcement of a second
dance to he given by the Univer
sity Band is made in another
column. The first effort of the
Band men, owing to various other
attractions on the same diite, and
a lack of college spirit on the part
of Borne of the members of the stu

dent body, was not repaid by a
sufficiently large attendance. It
was, however, a most successful
social affair and, as the next one
also will be, well deserving of the
support of the student body. The
Band men have taken a certain
risk in ordering instruments which
must be paid for. The purpose of
the dances, outside of augmenting
the list of Stanford social affairs, is
to raise funds through which the
permanency of the musical organ
ization will be insured. If we stop
for a moment and think of the dis
organized throng that would have
had possession of the Berkeley oval
last Saturday had it not been for
the leadership of the Band, we can
not but realize from this one in
stance the necessity and value of a
good band. In years past the stu
dent body has paid between two
and three hundred dollars rent for
the use of instruments during the
football season. The price of the
instruments is six hundred dollars,
and the Band will be permanent.
We can afford to support an organ
ization that not only deserves such
support from the standpoint of
loyalty but in addition offers us
full return for the price of tickets.
