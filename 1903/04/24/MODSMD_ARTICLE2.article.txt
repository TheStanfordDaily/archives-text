Palo Alto A. A. Mathewson, '06, is
very sick, his temperature having
reached 103. The patients at the
Lane Hospital are doing well. This
brings the total number of cases to
one hundred and twenty-eight.
Many of these cases reported have
been of the slightest character,
bordering rather upon the suspect
class than upon serious typhoid.
The Bcare has spread to the homes
of the students and many are in re
ceipt of telegrams to leave the re
gion of the infection at once. The
decision has been almost unani
mous on the part of the students to
stay at college, as it is the general
verdict that the fever is broken and
the source of infection closed.
