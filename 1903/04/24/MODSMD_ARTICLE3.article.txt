Editor Daily Palo Ai.to:
So much stress should not be put
upon the infringement of the emb
lem rule spoken of in Tuesday
night's Palo Alto. The man who
wore the Varsity "S" was working
in the tent and did so without a
hecond thought. He was asked to
accompany one of the athletes to
the starting point in the half-mile.
When looking about for a sweater
to slip on, he found none but the
Varsity, lie was hurried by the
announcer and took the sweater at
the request of tho√üe men in the tent,
hot stopping to hide the emblem in
his haste. An Athlete.
