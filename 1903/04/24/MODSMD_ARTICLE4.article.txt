# GEOLOGY AND MINING.
## Description and Equipment of the Building Now Being Erected for the Department. 
### 
The new quarters of the Depart
ment of Geology and Mining will
consist of the four buildings at the
southwest corner of the Outer and
Inner Quadrangles. The L-shaped
structure which forms the south
west corner will be the main build
ing of the department.
The main geological lecture
room —a room 59x44 feet, with
seats for 225 persons —will be on
the first floor of this building. The
lecture-room will contain cases
for the collections necessary for
lecture illustration, and will be ar
ranged for the use of the lantern.
A small preparation-room will join
from the main lecture-room and
connect also with the geological
museum,which will be in the larg
est room on the first floor. Of the
four remaining rooms on the first
floor, two will be used for collec
tions of mining machinery and
models, one will be used as a store
room, and one as a workshop.
The southwest corner room of
the second floor will be used for
the library of the department. A
lecture-room fitted for the use of
the lantern and with seats for fifty
students will open from the library.
The remainder of the second floor
will be devoted to paleontological
laboratories, a laboratory for exper
imental geology, drafting- and
map-room, and the offices of the
professors of Geology, Paleontol
ogy, Economic Geology and Mining.
The attic floor will contain a dark
room, photographic-room, draft
ing-room and storeroom.
The one story building on the
outer arcade north of the main
building will be arranged for min
eralogical work, especially for the
classes in blowpipe analysis. It
will contain an office for the pro
fessor in charge, a lecture-room,
storerooms, and a laboratory which
will accommodate sixty-five stu
dents.
The building on the inner arcade
at present occupied by the Depart
ment of Zoology with its present
interior arrangement will be used
for the courses in petrography.
The building on the Inner Quad
rangle formerly used by the Chem
istry department as a laboratory
for quantitative and qualitative
analysis will be remodelled and
fitted up as a laboratory to meet
the requirements of the laboratory
work which will be given in con
nection with the lecture work in
metallurgy. The general labora
tory will have desk accommodations
for two sections of thirty-two stu
dents each. The desks are to be
supplied with all the equipment
necessary for such work, such as
suction, air blast, and live steam.
Each desk will also be supplied
with a hood from which the fumes
will be drawn off by an exhaust
fan. There will be a furnace-room
in connection with the laboratory
which will be equipped with gas
and electric furnaces, and which
will be used more or less in con
nection with all the laboratory
work. The building will also con

tain the necessary rooms and
equipment for metallographic work,
an office for the instructing force, a
supply- and store-room, and a lec
ture-room. The lecture-room will
be arranged and equipped with
special reference to the use of the
lantern, both for projecting upon
the screen the ordinary lantern
slides and microscopic slides. In
order to darken the room quickly
and easily a special arrangement
for this purpose has been worked
out and will be installed.
