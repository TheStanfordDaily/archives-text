Editor Daily Palo Alto:
During the past semester about
190 students have paid their guild
fees. The Guild started into this
epidemic of typhoid fever with less
than $700. We have spent close to
$250 for equipment, and are now
under an expense of about $225
per week. We have a temporary
hospital fitted up in Encina Hall
in which we now have five men,
and one other has been discharged.
In Palo Alto we have fitted up an
other small temporary hospital, with,
at present writing, three patients.
In Lane Hospital, San Francisco,
we have two men whose time in
bed is indefinite.
We have at present five nurses,
one of whom is in a private family
attending a student not moved to a
hospital, and thus her board is
saved the Guild.
Probably before this goes to press
we shall have another nurse,as one
is much needed, and our expenses
will thus be increased between $25
and $30 per week.
In addition to our own patients,
we are furnishing a large number
of sick-room outfits to others who
are not under our care. Many of
these supplies cannot at present be
obtained at any price. They are
simply not to be had in either San
Francisco or San Jose.
As has always been the case, the
Guild is taking care of more non
members than members, and it is
glad to do it. It is the Guild's busi
ness to help any students who are
sick and need help, and this state
ment should show the need we have
for funds. If the students in gen
eral had paid the Guild fee, even
for one or two years back, no call
for funds would be necessary. As
it is, if those who have not paid
will do so now, we shall be greatly
helped.
Hans Barkan will spend Monday
upon the quad to receive dues, but
if you can not or do not see him,
dues may be paid to David or Mrs.
Burcham at Guild headquarters in
the old Chemistry lab. next to
the Church, to Miss Kip, Miss Tar
bell, or the undersigned.
