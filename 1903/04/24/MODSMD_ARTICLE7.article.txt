ting, '04. Director M. H. Thorpe,
'05, and G. H. Beebe, '04, are ex
officio members of all committees.
Director Thorpe has recently pro
cured a large amount of late music
from the East, and with frequent
practises will have the Band render
ing music that is near the point of
perfection by the date bet for the
dance. The event will be held in
Mullen's Hall, Palo Alto.
The last effort of the Band in
this direction was successful in
every particular that goes to make
an joyable dance. Owing to the
inopportune date on which it was
held, the attendance was small, but
this feature will be eliminated in
the coming affair.
