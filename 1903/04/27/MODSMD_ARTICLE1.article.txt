# WASHINGTON WINS.
## Debate in Seattle Goes Against Stanford with Unanimous Decision. 
### 
Word comes from Seattle that
the University cf Washington de
baters secured a unanimous deci
sion from the Stanford trio in the
second annual oontest held last
Friday evening. Details of the de
bate have not yet been reported.
The question for discussion was:
''Resolved, That the English con
stitution is more democratic than
that of the United States." Stan
ford supported the affirmative,
while the Northerners argued the
democratic points of the written con
stitution of this country. Washing
ton submitted the question and
Stanford-selected the side, but even
with this advantage the Washing
ton team proved too strong for the
Cardinal's second team.
The speakers for Stanford were:
J. Page, '03, W. C. Maloy, '03,
Alex Sheriffs, '05. Page opened
the debate and gave the rebuttal
speech in the affirmative. Maloy
spoke second and Sheriffs third.
Pierce, who proved to be California's
strongest debater in 1901 and 1902
and who tranferred to Washington
this year, held the third and
strongest position on the Washing
tan team.
The decision in this debate gives
Washington the lead, as the contest
held here last year resulted in a tie.
The agreement between Stanford
and Washington called for but two
annual debates. Whether or not
another series will be arranged re
mains for the debating committee
of Stanford to decide.
