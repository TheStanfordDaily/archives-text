The opening of the membership
roll of the Student's Guild has
added considerable to the sum
which the association is using in
its work. Several hundred dol
lars in contributions have come in.
Though the Guild has not yet
started a subscription list it will
probably be necessary to do so
within a week or two, and every
thing turned in at this time will
not be amiss. The Guild now has
in its care a number of sick stu
dents and expects to ifieet the call
of every needy student who be
comes ill. The treasurer of the
Guild is Hans Balkan, and to him
all funds may be sent.
