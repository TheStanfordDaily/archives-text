Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As one of the women from other
colleges, Stanford appealed to nie
objectively for a time, and gome
conclusions which I formed as a
stranger may at least serve to open
the discussion called for by IS. L.
in the recent woman's edition ot
the Palo Alto. My first impres
sion of Stanford women was of a
certain independence, not of hear
ing so much as of action, which
was ,not without its nohility and
impulsiveness. The second im
pression was of the lack of "team
work."
The Women's League may fall
short of its aim. It has at least
accomplished this: that the faculty
women and the student women
have at last a meeting ground and
are 110 longer strangers. This in
itself is no slight achievement for
one year's effort.
In some Eastern colleges consoli
dation of the student women's in
terests has resulted favorably. A
general hoard of control has been
established 011 which all activities
relating to women, whether en
tirely feminine or co-educational
in character are represented. This
is along the line of the General
Federation of Women's Clubs.
The women's tennis team, gymnas
ium club, debating societies, Y. W.
C. A. missionary society, choral
society, women's quartette, glee
club, basket-ball team, publica
tions, and sororities each have a
representative.
Suppose that Stanford had a
women's club-house not far from
the quad where all student women's
activities might find a home. It
might have offices, rest and assem
bly rooms, and a cafeteria. Then
the women who bring lunches
might have a pleasant place to
spent the noon hour, visitors from
out of town could be entertained,
and a center for University wom
en's life be established. The men
will have this in the new gymnas
ium. Why not the women? My
ideal women's league would be one
which should piovide such a build
ing, where girls with different in
terests could meet with true uni
versity spirit; centralize and direct
Buch activities, and then conduct
classes in parliamentary law and
good breeding. Why not? The
young ladies' finishing school was
not such a had affair in its time,
and it equipped the mothers of the
gentlemen of the old school. Any
one who has attended women's
meetings, here or elsewhere, realizes
the practical utility of a knowledge
of parliamentary usages. The
faculty women should stand shoul
der to shoulder with the Univer
lity students. Both should be rep
resented, for their interests are
common. A proportion of the

Stanford girls of today are to be
the faculty women of the future.
We need—we are eager—for Rob
erts' Rules of Order.
