# TYPHOID SITUATION.
## A 						Few New Cases Reported.—Gradual Improvement in Those of Long Standing. 
### 
The abrupt end to the inroads of
the typhoid epidemic which has
been confidently expected both on
the campus and in Palo Alto for
the past week, has not yet arrived.
Although the increase in the num
ber of reported cases is by no
means proportionate to the early
spread of the disease, there is still
a steady numerical increase in
thope who have been taken with
the fever. Palo Alto, at present,
reports the largest number of cases.
In spite of the fact that the Health
Commissioners of Santa Clara
county declare that the backbone
of the epidemic has been broken,
there were five cases reported dur
ing yesterday and today. F. E.
Brackett,'o3, and Miss Cecelia Ath
erton, '03, from the campus, are
sick, Miss Atherton having been
taken to the Lane Hospital. In
Palo Alto C. H. Thompson, '06,
and Geo. Lull, '03, are sick, while
Mrs. Lull, ex-'O3, is also a sufferer.
The disease is running its natur
al course in most of the cases of two
and three weeks'standing. All the
men in the Lane Hospital have
been reported upon favorably, al
though their condition is held to
be serious. R. D. Barrett, '04, at
the old Delta Tau Delta house in
Palo Alto, is in most critical condi
tion, though his life is no longer
dispaired of. His temperature is
very high and his general system
extremely debilitated. There are
ten men at the Phi Delta Theta
house who are cared for by four
nurses. Of these cases three are
serious. Geo. Hodge, '06, E. I. Fris
selle, '03, and YV, Taylor, '05. The
others are more than holding their
own. In Encina Hall there are six
men in the emergency ward. Five
of the six are improving slowly but
surely, only one case, that of J. K.
Yasuda, '06, presenting an unfav
orable aspect. E. O. James is
convalescent. S. G. Jewitt, '06, at
the Zeta Psi house, is still feeble,
but is on the road to recovery.
Both the University physicians
and the doctors of Palo Alto are
»ur« that it will only be a matter
of a few days before the spread of
the disease will have been com
:ijj?tetely stopped and those now sick
on the high road to a speedy re

covery. With the exceptions al
ready noted, the progress of the
fever is almost universally favor
able.
The Student Guild has done a
vast amount of real service during
the past three weeks, and not until
the last week have they been han
dicapped by a lack of funds. The
appeal which the Guild made last
Friday met with ready response on
the part of both the faculty and
undergraduates today. Baikal)
received over fifty dollars on the
quad this morning, while the indi
vidual subscriptions of private
donors amounts to nearly one
hundred and fifty dollars more.
There is an insistent rumour that
Mrs. Stanford intends to come to
the aid of those sufferers who are
unable to meet the heavy expenses
incident to a siege of the fever,
but at present this story lacks
authenticity. As the news of the
epidemic goes farther afield there
are more demands on the part of
the parents that students leave the
infected region, but there has been
a steady refusal on the part of the
undergraduates to develop any
thing bordering on a scare, so that
the situation remains practically
unchanged.
