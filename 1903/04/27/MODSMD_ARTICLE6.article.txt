the University at her residence in

given her under the original char
ter and will authorize the Trustees
to assume active management.
At the meeting Mrs. Stanford
read an address setting forth the
work done in the enlargement of
the University since the last meet
ing, together with a very full state
ment of the plans that are now un
der way for new buildings. In this
connection she stated that the plans
for the new Library building are
being completed and that work
will be commenced in the early part
of June.
Mrs. Stanford has instructed the
attorneys to make all possible
haste in preparing the papers for
the formal transfer to the Trustees
in order that she may leave for
Europe as soon as the test case is
tried. Hon. S. F. Leib of San Jose
and George E. Crothers will be
assisted by T. G. Crothers in the
legal work.
During her visit to Europe Mrs.
Stanford will spend some time in

about a year. She will leave some
time in the first part of July.
