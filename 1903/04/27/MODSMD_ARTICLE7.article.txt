# "Quad" Progressing Slowly.
## 
### 
The printing of the Quad is pro
gressing rather slowly at the office
of the Stanley-Taylor Co., the edit
ors preferring to take more time and
have the book carefully printed
than to sacrifice care to rapidity.
Editor Russell has spent most of
the past week in the city watching
the printing and proofs, and unless
some unforeseen accident occurs the
book will be in the hands of the
binders about May first. Two
forms a day are being printed and
these allowed plenty of time to dry
before being printed on the reverse
side. This slowness allows of the
most careful preparations for
bringing half-tones into the beet
positions for printing, and the
watching of the make-up for typo
graphical imperfections.
The type used in the book is an
entirely new kind, put on the
market less than a month ago by
the American Type Founders Com
pany. It was purchased especially
for the Quad, and gives promise
of replacing I'ostOld Style, used in
last year's Quad, as a book type.
The half-tones are much better
than those appearing in the lilue
and Gold, which is now being
printed at the same office, and
which were made in San Francisco.

This comparison jiistifien the Quad
in sending the work Eawt.
In size the book will be fully
four hundred pages,—fifty over the
the number of last year. In order
to keep it down to this size several
important articles, notably one by
Mrs. Truesdnle on the Elizabethan
play, had to be omitted; and sev
eral others cut extensively.
Allowing ten days to bind and
deliver the book, it ought to be
placed on sale during the second
week in May. The edition will be
limited to 600 copies, the same as
published last year.
