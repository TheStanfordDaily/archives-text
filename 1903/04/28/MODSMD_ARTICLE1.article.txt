# MAY ABOLISH GATE MONEY.
## Dr. Jordan Says Ultimate End at Stanford University is Endowed Athletics. 
### 
In his recent address before the
Teachers' Association held at the
University of Chicago, Dr. Jordan
announced that the policy Stan
ford will follow in the future would
finally lead to the doing away
of gate fees at athletic events.
When recently seen Dr. Jordan said
that while such a method would
Hooner or later be putin force
here, no change was probable for
some years, at least not in the im
mediate future. "While the abuses
that have been most glaring at
Eastern universities have not been
present to any considerable extent
at Stanford because of the fact that
athletic loafers have not been toler
ated, we recognize the fact that the
desire to get great crowds will be
abolished only when the gate re
ceipts are done away with. As I
said at Chicago, the loose rules
tolerated in athletics at some insti
tutions are due to the apathy of the
faculties, who permit men to play
on the teams who are amateurs in
no sense of the word. I believe
heartily in the encouragement of
athletics, but I believe in their
judicious regulation. When long
seasons of preparation for a contest
are gone through, and expensive
training tables are kept, the ath
lete is more and more regarded as
a favored individual. While I
would not have the training tables
abandoned, I am in favor of a
system that looks more and more
to keeping the men in practical
training all the time."
Regarding the mode to be putin
force when gate money is abolished
Dr. Jordan said there were two
systems that would come up for
adoption. One is in force at West
Point, where admission is by invi
tation with no fees, and the other
is the Oxford method, where invi
tations with a small fee are sent
out. Dr. Jordan said he was in
favor of the University endowing
athletics, though he was not in a
position to say just what stand the
trustees would take on this ques
tion.
lie pointed out that the games
previous to the intercollegiate con
test could be attended by the pre
sentation of student cards such as
the present registration cards, while
for the big games some arrange
ment could be made between the
two universities for an equal distri
bution of invitations. Dr. Jordan
said that this would be practicable
since smaller crowds will attend
when the intercollegiate games
take place on the respective cam
puses.
