The need and necessity of the
new tennis courts are apparent to
everyone who has kept in touch
with athletics this semester. Al
though we allowed our men
to go against the State Uni
versity totally unprepared for the
contest it will never be done again.
The courts are laid, but are not yet
paid for. A generous response on
the part of the student body was
marked a few months ago and is
no less necessary today.
