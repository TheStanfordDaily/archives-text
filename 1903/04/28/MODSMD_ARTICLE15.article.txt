The movement toward the es
tablishment of rowing at Stanford
should not be allowed to suffer at
its inception through lack of inter
est on the part of the student body
or of the members of the associa
tion. Every man who is at pres
ent a member of the Hoat Club
should appear for daily practice

and there should be many addi
tions to the membership roll of the
club. The dues are not excessive,
there is no initiation fee as at
Berkeley, and membership in the
club entails no heavy burdens.
Faithful work at this time of the
year should operate to place on the
water a body of men well prepared
to undertake the task of perfecting
themselves in the finer points of the
sport next fall. Professor Smith
has and will continue to devote
considerable time and energy in
coaching those men who appear.
With a fair amount of interest
shown on the part of the student
body and such favorable circum
stances, there is no reason why the
Boat Club should not turn a con
ceded defeat into victory next
November.
