# Boating Outlook.
## 
### 
For some time past there have
been daily practises on the lake in
both the pair-oar and the four
oared barges. Between ten and
twenty men have turned out each
evening and worked under the su
pervision of Prof. A. W. Smith.
The purpose of the spring work has
been to develop a large number of
men in whom the elements of a
good stroke have been grounded so
that in the fall effective work can
be begun at once. Lagunita will
be dry next September, but at that
time satisfactory means of convey
ance to the bay will be provided
for those men who have made good
progress upon the lake.
There is general disappointment
that all the members of the Boat
Club have not turned out for daily
practise. Those in charge have
stated that the best work can only
be done by those who are regular
in practise and come equipped with
a light, sleeveless shirt, tight fitting
running trousers and tennis slip
pers. A temporary dressing room
has been provided in the back
room of the boat-house where these
things may be left with safety.
Membership in the Boat Club is
still open. The dues are fifty .cents
a month, and there is no initiation
fee. The club members are entitled
to the care of an experienced coach
and some of the club members are
men of experience with the oar.
