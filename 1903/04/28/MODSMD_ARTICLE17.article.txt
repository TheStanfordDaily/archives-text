# SUNDAY IN CHURCH.
## Walter Handel Thorley Played on Big Organ.—Rev. Heber Newton Preached on "Doubt." 
### 
The afternoon services at Memor
ial church partook very largely of
the nature of an organ recital.
Walter Handel Thorley, who has
an international reputation as an
organist, played many numbers in
a varied program. He excelled in
the rendition of the allegro move
ments, delicacy of touch, and per
fection of technique, combining to
give almost perfect harmony.
"Canzone," an original composi
tion by Thorley, held the audience
with its quiet dignity and stately
cadences. The recital was a rare
treat for music lovers.
Dr. Newton preached in the
morning on "Doubt." The presence
of St. Thomas in the group of the
twelve Apostles in the chancel
of the Church suggests the question
whether he had a legitimate place
among the Apostles. A doubter, a
rationalist; and yet an apostle.
There is a double view found
concerning doubt itself. To scien
tific and philosophic searchers
after truth, doubt is no terrible
bug-bear, but a useful and indis
pensable servant of truth. It is
the principle of progress into truth.
On the other hand, churchly teach
ers speak suspiciously of St. Thomas
and frankly denounce doubt. The
clergy who rejoice in being sound,
confuse him with the devil. There
is not a little to warrant this sus
picion of doubt. Every most fun
damental conviction of man is
nothing more than a belief. We
walk by faith. It is indeed a seri
ous matter when an atmosphere of
doubt spreads through the church,
in which the faith is clouded over.
Can doubt be thus at once good and
evil?
What science and philosophy
mean by doubt is the spirit whose
proper synonym is inquiry. Its
legitimate fruition is reasonable be
lief. Thus doubt has a legitimate
and reasonable function in the
Church. For the assurance of its
own faith the church must doubt,
either in all its members or in
certain fitted minds.
None the less it must be borne in
mind that doub't is not the normal
state, though a natural and neces
sary experience. It is an incident
of growth. The normal state is
aith —credit, reliance, confidence,
trust. Every chilcl passing into
manhood goes through its physical
crises, but with risk always. Need
ful as it is to question, it is fatal to
become habitually questioning.
A man must try his doubt.
There is a dilettante, irrational,
uncandid, and dishonest doubt

abroad in the world to be dealt
with by an earnest mind heroically.
There are, however, doubts thor
oughly honorable and noble, before
which we must stand in pity or in
awe, or even at times in admira
tion. The test of the true doubt is
that it utters Goethe's dying cry,
"More light."
The true treatment of doubt is to
follow one's questions resolutely,
incessantly, fearlessly, patiently,
until they are forced out from the
shadows which they haunt into the
light where they vanish. As
Carlyle learned from Goethe, action
is often the cure for doubting.
Earnest life will clear the mind
from within. If through the dark
ness no bright light is discernable,
the light on the headland of duty
pierces the clouds. You shall
weather the fiercest storms and lay
a straight course through the
thickest gloom if you keep your eye
upon the right and never slip its
hearings.
