# TENNIS SUBSCRIPTIONS.
## Money Coming In Slowly and Three Hundred Dollars Still to Be Raised. 
### 
Treasurer Edwards has been put
in full charge of the collection of
the funds for paying for the new
tennis court. Since the first of the
semester when a halt was called on
the pushing forward of the sub
scriptions, money has been coming
in slowly. Treasurer Edwards has
received from the training house
corporation $100, which with the
$250 netted from the Sophomore
minstrel show and $00 subscrip
tions already turned in, leaves $300
still to be raised.
Few of those who promised
money have turned it in. Of the
twelve on the committee but three
have reported. All money prom
ised or which will be donated will
be turned over immediately to
Treasurer Edwards.
The court is complete with the
exception of the lines and the wire
netting backstops. The net posts
have been putin, and the sup
ports for the wire netting are up.
In regard to direction and light,
the court is almost ideally located.
The oaks to the north and Encina
to the south form excellent back
grounds. The court is shaped so
that it will drain well.
Joe Daily, the famous veteran
professional of the California Ten
nis Club, will mark the court. The
screen will be put up immediately,
and the court ready for use within
a week.
