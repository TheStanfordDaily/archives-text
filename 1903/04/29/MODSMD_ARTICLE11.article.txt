While the backbone of the
typhoid epidemic is broken, care
and vigilance on tbe part of the
students should not be allowed to
relax. It is unusually important
that students should observe for
some time the precautionary meas
ures advised by the physicians at
the outbreak. Since the fever is
now subsiding, it remains for the
students to keep down false reports
and allay the alarming rumors
that are going the rounds of the
Eastern press. If the situation is
carefully explained, the harm that
has already been done will be con
siderably counteracted.
