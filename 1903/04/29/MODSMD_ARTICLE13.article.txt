# MORE ON TYPHOID.
## This Week Will be Turning Point for Many.â€”Review of Cases. 
### 
This week will probably be the
hardest week upon the typhoid
patients, as many of theui reach in
it the critical period of their illness.
Those who first took the fever were
many of them ignorant of the fact
that they were sick, and neglected
taking even the most elementary
precautions. It is with these pa
tients that the malady will be and
has been most severe. Those who
have been taken down within the
last two weeks have almost all been
under the doctors' care since the
appearanceof the earliest symptoms
of the fever in their systems. To
day is the end of the period of in
cubation, yet new cases may de
develop. Many of those who
stopped using milk from the in
fected dairy took no precaution
toward cleansing utensils in which
milk had stood. However, the
doctors think the malady has
reached its limit, and the fight
must now be made only with those
who are sick.
The Students' Guild has taken
possession of the Y. W. C. A. Club
house in Palo Alto and will move
into it any patients for whom they
cannot provide in other hospitals.
In the house are three very sick
students: Miss Jane Bean, '04,
Chas. Paxton, '06, and Miss H. C.
Osher, '06. Miss Bean is doing
much better today than yesterday
or Sunday. Paxton, who was one
of the strongest men in college, is
very ill. Miss Osher was kept
alive only by the use of stimulants.
Of the other patients in the house
Miss Luella Gary, '05, who was
taken down last Friday, seems the
least ill. Miss Lewers, '06, while
not in any great danger, is seri
ously ill. Miss G. E. Beasley, '06,
has been confined to her room but
a few days and is doing well.
R. I). Barrett, '04, at the old
Delta Tau Delta house, has had a
hard time and for several days his
life was despaired of, but late re
ports have him past the turning
point, though not yet out of danger.
E. E. Miller,'o4,at the same house,
is now much improved and past
danger. George Lull, '04, and his
wife are ill, Lull being most of the
time delirious. This morning their
infant son died of heart failure.
At the Phi Dulta Theta house on
the campus are three men seriously
ill. E. I. Frisselle, '03, has been
almost as ill as was Barrett last
week. The next two days will be
the critical period for VV. R.Taylor,
'05, and George Hodge, '06.
At the Students' Guild hospital
in Encina all are doing well except
J. K. Yasuda, '06, a Japanese stu
dent. Yasuda is very sick.
The students in San Francisco
hospitals are doing as well as could
be expected. The last reports

from Miss I. Hart, who is in a
San Jose sanitarium, were very
favorable.
The nurses who are with the
Palo Alto and campus patients
have had their hands full, and ad
ditional nurses are hard to get. A
number of these nurses are being
employed by Mrs. Stanford. When
ever possible those who show
symptoms are sent home by the
doctors. Monday Miss Harriet
Buss, '06, went from the Y. M. C. A.
Clubhouse to her home in Bakers
field. Yesterday Miss Alice Rich
ards, '05, was sent to a hospital in
San Francisco.
