# "Harpers Weekly" on English Play.

### 
The current issue of Harper's
Weekly publishes a half-page illus
trated article on " An Elizabethan
Play by College Students," which
is a good account of the "Knight of
the Burning I'estle," recently given
in Assembly Hall. It has the fol
lowing:
"An interesting phase of contem
porary drama is the attempt to re
produce old plays with sufficient
attention to historical settings to
carry the spectators back, in some
measure, to the stage conditions of
the period when the play was first
produced. In England these re
vivals of early plays have been
given notably under the auspices
of the Elizabethan Stage Society,
and during the past winter Ameri
cans have seen with no little en
thusiasm some of the work of that
society in the reproduction of the
old Morality play, "Everyman."
For the most part, however, such
reproductions in this country have
been undertaken by the students of
the universities —a revival of the
old custom of rendering the classic
drama on the college stage. At
Stanford University the interest in
this sort of dramatic study has al
ready won some distinction. A
year ago the students of the Greek
department presented Sophocles'
"Antigone" at their own college and
at the University of California;
and this year the members of the
English Club —a voluntary stu
dents' organization—have present
ed Beaumont and Fletcher's
"Knight of the Burning Pestle" at
the two universities. The repre
sentation was planned to conform,
in all practicable details, to the
traditions of the Elizabethan stage

of 1610. The stage structure was
modelled after the sketch of the
Swan Theatre made by the Dutch
scholar De Witt, about 1596, and
reproduced as closely as possible
the London playhouses of Shaks
pere's day.
"The opening of the play was an
nounced, after the historic fashion,
by three trumpet-calls from the
upper windows of the stage struc
ture. There was no curtain-rais
ing, and the entire stage was
throughout in full view of the aud
ience."
