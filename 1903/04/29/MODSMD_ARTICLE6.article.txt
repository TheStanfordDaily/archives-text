The following is from the address

"What we most need in Califor
nia is true University Spirit,—a
Bpirit that will make us think of
California first and our classes and
fraternities second. At Stanford
University recently the name of
Overall was mentioned at a base
ball rally. He was their great
est opponent and most feared rival.
Yet when a cheer was proposed for
him it was given by the Stanford
rooters with as much gusto and
vim as if he had been their own
hero instead of their rival. As
university men, in our relations
with Stanford we should conduct
ourselves like sportsmen and uni
versity gentlemen, and refrain
from any cheering except that
given to sportsmanlike men for
sportsmanlike behavior."
