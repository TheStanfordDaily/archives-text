# LIMIT WOMEN STUDENTS.
## Specials and Those with Partial Standing Cannot Register in 1904. 
### 
The following quotations taken
from the University register are
important for the reason that they
develop the fact that the number of
women has reached the five hun
dred limit and that they will have
considerable bearing on the future
registration of women students.
The first regulation to go in force
is the following: "On account of
the limitation upon the number of
women students, in and after Aug
ust, 1903, women will not be ad
mitted as special students. This
latter provision will not affect
those who have already matricu
lated in the University."
Registrar 0. L. Elliott states that
calculations based upon the grad
ual increase of women students for
the past several years, place the
estimate of those who will apply
for admittance next August at five
hundred and fifty. By eliminating
the new applications for special
work the difficulty can be bridged
over for another year.
The second regulation is to the
effect that in and after August, 1904,
the provision made for students in
partial standing will not be ex
tended to women • applying for ad
mission for the first time. Thin
will materially thin the ranks of
hopeful women students.
The elasticity with which this
latter rule can be applied will be a
safe means for- regulating and
maintaining the five hundred limit
for several years to come. How
ever, when the number of women
who can present full entrance re
quirements shall have become
sufficiently great to run the total
above five hundred,the only means
left to preserve the regulation will
be to refuse registration to all new
applications from women at alter
nate years.
The number of women students
registered during the present semes
ter is four hundred and ninety-nine,
which is one from the limit. Last
semester the number came within
two of the allowed number.
