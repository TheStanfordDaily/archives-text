Miss Lillian Andrews, '99, ad
dressed the Y. W. C. A. meeting
Tuesday on the work of the Asso
ciated Charities of San Francisco.
"The business of the Associated
Charities," she said, "is not to send
relief but to investigate the merit
of applications for charity and to
ameliorate the social conditions of
the people among whom it works."
