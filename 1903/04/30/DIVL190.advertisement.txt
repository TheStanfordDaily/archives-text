OPENING ANNOUNCEMENT
WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE
PEOPLE OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND PALO
ALTO TO THE OPENING ON
Saturday, May 2d
OF ONE OF THE MOST MODERN FURNITURE STORES
ON THIS COAST
THIS NEW ENTERPRISE WILL BE KNOWN AS THE
FERGUSON FURNITURE COMPANY
Inc.
Incorporated under the laws of the State of California, with a capital stock
of $20,000, we will occupy the two-story building on University avenue
erected less than a year ago for the Pattosien Furniture Co. The ollicers
of the corporation are: A. S. Ferguson, president and manager, who man
aged for nine years and recently dissolved the dry goods firm of Ferguson
& Co.; Win. J. Pattosien, vice-president, founder and manager of the
Pattosien three-acre furniture store in Sun Fiancisco; J. J. Morris, secre
tary ; and Edward Ackley, treasurer. With 13,000 square feet of floor
space, our company can carry an immense stock, and the fact that Mr.
Pattosien is president of the Pattosien Co. of San Francisco and vice
president of the Fermi son Furniture Co. of Palo Alto, places us in a posi
tion to buy our goods at car-lot prices—an advantage of pecuniary interest
to our customers. When it is taken into consideration that our furniture
is bought at factory prices (not through middlemen or jobbers), that our
monthly rental is lees than the daily rental of many city stores, and that
to the original cost we do not have to add heavy interest 011 investments,
mortgages and bank loans — it will require no argument to convince the
intelligent house-furnisher that we can and will save them money on
every transaction.
The first floor will be used for hard-finished furniture, mantels, etc.,
with a separate appartment for stoves, ranges, and kitchen furniture. On
the main gallery will be kept upholstered furniture, parlor suits, tapestry
goods, portieres, couch covers, lace curtains, and bed furnishings. A sep
arate room on the same floor will be utilized for the manufactory of win
dow shades, curtain rods, etc. On the top floor will be kept art squares,
rugs, carpets, floor oil cloth, linoleum, matting, and general reserve stock.
