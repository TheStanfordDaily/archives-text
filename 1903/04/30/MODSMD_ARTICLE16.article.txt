Captain McCaughern is to be
commended upon giving up a trip
for his track team in order that the
money which would come from the
French play may he turned over to
the • Students' Guild. The track
men deserve a trip as much as any
team we ever had. They worked
hard, trained consistently, and in
every way are a credit to the insti
tution. But at present the need of
the Students' Guild for money is
very pressing. It has depended and
always must depend upon member
ship fees, donations, and subscrip
tions for its support. Its officers have
found an immense amount of work
to do and have much still to do.
The sum that will be put into its
treasury by the French play will
be a help. Other aid must be
forthcoming or the Guild will find
itself fifteen hundred or two thou
sand dollars in debt.
