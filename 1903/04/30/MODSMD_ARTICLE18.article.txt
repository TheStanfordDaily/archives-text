# TYPHOID SITUATION.
## Another Death Today. Hirayama, '06, Passes Away at the Guild Hospital. 
### 
About noon today, Y. Hirayama,
a Japanese student in the fresh
man class of the University, died
from the typhoid fever. Hirayama
was taken sick about two weeks ago
at the house of W. H. Sloan in
Palo Alto, where he was working.
The Students' Guild took him in
charge sit their temporary hospital
in Palo Alto, where he died today.
The fever, combined with intestinal
trouble proved too much for his
constitution. Hirayama has been
in this country but a short time,
having registered in the University
immediately after his arrival.
The other typhoid patients are,
as a whole, doing well. The four
at the Y. \V. C. A. Clubhouse in
Palo Alto who were in such a
critical condition yesterday showed
marked improvement today. The
men in Encina are slowly gaining,
two having gone into the convales
cent ward. But two new cases
have been reported, Miss H. C.
Hetherington, '06, and Miss H. E.
Olding, '06, both of whom live in
Palo Alto. Reports from the vari
ous temporary hospitals show that
conditions are changing but slowly.
Improvement is not rapid but in
almost every case the tendency is
for the better.
J. E. McDowell, '00, who return
ed last week from the Southern Pa
cific hospital in San Francisco af
ter the doctors had decided that he
was free from danger of typhoid,
was taken down last night at the
Phi Delta Theta house and today
is seriously ill.
