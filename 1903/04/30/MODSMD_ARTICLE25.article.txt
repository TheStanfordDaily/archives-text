# ENGLISH CLUB ELECTION.
## New Officers and Executive Committee Chosen. Permanent Home May be Secured. 
### 
At a meeting of the English Club
last night officers were elected for
next semester as follows: President,
Harry R. Johnson, '03; vice-presi
dent, Miss Alice Kimball, '04; sec
retary and treasurer, Norman Coll
yer, '04. The following executive
committee was chosen: Misß Ethel
Traphagen, '04, Miss Marie Burn
ham, '04, Miss Irene Wright, '04,
Instructor Seward of the English
department, and W. 11. B. Fowler,
'06.
Harry Johnson, who succeeds
Roy Hadley as president, is one of
the most active and enthusiastic
members of the club. He has been
a contributor to the Sequoia and
was joint author, with F. B. Wag
ner, '02, of last year's junior farce.
He was assistant manager of the
Elizabethan play recently produced
by the club."The Knight of the
Burning Pestle," and much of its
success was due to his untiring
energy.
Instructor Seward spoke of the
work of the club for the next year,
and there was some discussion of a
new departure in the policy of the
club. At present the club has no
permanent home, and the advisa
bility of securing permanent head
quarters on the quad or elsewhere
was considered. With the posses
sion of a permanent home it would
be possible to collect such manu
scripts and books as are of special
interest to the University. Noth
ing of this kind has hitherto been
done, and much excellent material
haß been lost. A closer organiza
tion of the club would also place it
in a position to entertain properly
men of literary note who visit the
University.
The club listened to H. P. Earle's
final report as treasurer of the
Elizabethan play. 'Phis showed a
surplus of $240.
The club elected four new mem
bers: Miss Helen Lamson, '05, A.A.
Hampson, '04, Hugh Mo ran, '04,
and E. R. May, '06. Miss Lamson,
Hampson, and Moran are all well
known Stanford writers,their work
appearing constantly in theSequoia.
E. R. May took a leading part in
the production of "The Knight of
the Burning Pestle."
