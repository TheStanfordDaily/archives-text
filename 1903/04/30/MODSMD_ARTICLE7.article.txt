# FOOTBALL PRACTISE ENDS.
## In September Men Will be Ready to Start Fall Work on Even Basis with California. 
### 
Spring football practise has been
discontinued for the year. Two
reasons have been operative to
bring about this result: The clos
ing weeks of the college year de
mand so much of the men's time
that they have little to devote to
football practise. With the change
in the date of opening college Stan
ford will be placed on an even
basis with California as regards the
amount of time for football work in
the fall.
For the past month the football
men have worked consistently al
though unobtrusively at their
punting in the oval. Three times
a week the squad has been out for
afternoon work. Attention has
been devoted almost entirely to de
veloping a punter. Two men have
been tried at place-kicking: Dole,
'05, right half on last year's Var
sity, and Sprott, '0(>, the crack
freshman tackle, have shown good
progress, and should go far to solve
the problem that will confront, Stan
ford next year of finding a man to
oppose Overall. The remainder of
the men have been tried at punt
ing, and several have showed en
couraging form.
There will be more kicking ma
terial at Stanford next year than
was at first expected. Magee, cap
tain of last year's Freshman team,
will probably be back; McGilvray,
last year's full-back, will return;
a reasonable number of good play
ers may be expected to enter next
fall, and of the present squad, sev
eral may develop into punters.
The men have hail the advantage
of spring work and will be in a po
sition to show up well in the punt
ing contest for the Senior Club cup
to be held next fall.
The innovation has proved a
qualified success. There has not
been evinced the interest on the
part of players or student body that
should have greeted such a move
ment, but next year the movement
may be expected to be of more im
portance. The aim of developing
good punters has been partly ful
filled, and the seriousness of this
question has been reduced.
