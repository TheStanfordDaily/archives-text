# WOMAN'S EDITION.
## "Chappita" Supplants "Chappie" for One Issue. On Sale on Quad Tomorrow. 
### 
The woman's edition of the Chap
arral will make its appearance
upon the quad tomorrow morning.
It is decidedly superior to the
woman's edition of last year.
Clever ''joshes," good prose, witty
verse, and illustrations up to a
Chaparral average, combine to
make an interesting, number.
"Cliappita" has done more to vindi
cate the hammer which adorns the
front page of the Chaparral than
any editor since the inimitable
Bristow Adams. ' l Chappita ,, has
"knocked.'' ller editorials are a
compound of "knocks," â€”"knocks"
without any particular end in view,
some without point, some without
discretion, but still in a way Chap
arral "knocks" of the "Bristow"
hue. The Sequoia is cleverly
caricatured both in prose and in
verse, and in a column of book
notices the humor is of the best.
Many of the jokes require a great
stretch of the imagination to inter
pret, but at least they have the ad
vantage of not being weather-worn.
The dedicatory poem and illus
tration are only a forerunner of the
other good things along lines artis
tic. Miss Lathrop and Miss Well
man both contribute work of de
cided merit, a full-page drawing
by Miss NVellman being of her best.
The concluding parody on the
Ladies' Home Journal, "How Some
Young Couples Live," is a fitting
climax to an edition by women
which stops at nothing to make
fun.

H. Brown, '03, has the following
