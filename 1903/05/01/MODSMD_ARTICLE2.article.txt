# Among the Patients.
## 
### 
The following announcement
was given out from the President's
office thib afternoon:
The first two deaths among the
students suffering from typhoid
fever occurred last night. These
two students, Miss Osher and Mr.
Hirayama, have been among the
dangerous cases from the beginning.
The excellent judgment and self
control shown by the student body
throughout this trying situation
has been effectual in preventing
the many unfounded rumors, aris
ing daily, from receiving serious
consideration. Jt should be re
membered that while the coming
week is full of gravest dangers to
those at present ill, the situation
with reference to the student body
in general is decidedly improved.
W. F. Snow,
Assistent Professor of Hygiene.
On the whole the patients passed
an easy night. Those who were
first taken sick and were not put
under the doctor's care in time, are
the sickest. Most of those cases
require constant attention, some of
them receiving the care of two
nurses continually.

As near as possible the following
| list is complete. A number of
students have gone home without
notifying the University authori
ties, and are sick at their homes.
Reports concerning those not on

reports that are attainable are li
able to be inaccurate, the nature of
the malady being such that a pa
tient's condition rises and falls.

The following announcement
was given out from the President's
office thib afternoon:
The first two deaths among the
students suffering from typhoid
fever occurred last night. These
two students, Miss Osher and Mr.
Hirayama, have been among the
dangerous cases from the beginning.
The excellent judgment and self
control shown by the student body
throughout this trying situation
has been effectual in preventing
the many unfounded rumors, aris
ing daily, from receiving serious
consideration. Jt should be re
membered that while the coming
week is full of gravest dangers to
those at present ill, the situation
with reference to the student body
in general is decidedly improved.
W. F. Snow,
Assistent Professor of Hygiene.
On the whole the patients passed
an easy night. Those who were
first taken sick and were not put
under the doctor's care in time, are
the sickest. Most of those cases
require constant attention, some of
them receiving the care of two
nurses continually.

As near as possible the following
| list is complete. A number of
students have gone home without
notifying the University authori
ties, and are sick at their homes.
Reports concerning those not on
the campus are hard to get, and the
reports that are attainable are li
able to be inaccurate, the nature of
the malady being such that a pa
tient's condition rises and falls.
