# Guild Statement.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
One of the contributors to the
Guild has suggested that periodic
statements of Guild affairs should
be made, and knowing the interest
of Daily Palo Alto readers in all
that pertains to the typhoid situ
ation, it seems to be a good idea.
During the week the Guild was
asked to take charge of the Y. W.
C. A. house and it lias done so.
When'we took it over there were
six cases of typhoid in the house,
with five nurses. Four of the cases
were very serious, and extra nurses
were added. Four new patients
have been added at this house and
one has passed away â€”Miss Osher.
At our Waverly street hospital we
have also had one fatality, M.
Hirayama yesterday, he having
a complication of troubles.
We have at present in the En
cina hospital seven cases, two of
which are in the con valescent ward;
at 845 Waverly street, four cases;
at the Y. W. C. A. house, eight
cases; at the Lane hospital, three
cases; and one case at a private
residence for which we are furnish
ing a nurse. Altogether we have
seventeen nurses.
Our financial responsibilities are
large and have been increasing
steadily, but are probably now at a
maximum.
The action of the track team in
turning over to the Guild the pro
ceeds of the French play which
had been offered to them is a par
ticularly generous and pleasing
gift, and I wish to thank them
gratefully on behalf of the Guild.
The support, financial and moral,
that the Guild is receiving is very
gratifying. One donation of $25
came today from a gentleman in
Berkeley. However, much is
needed yet, but with the support
we are receiving we feel we can
meet all needs.
Frank L. Heps, President.
