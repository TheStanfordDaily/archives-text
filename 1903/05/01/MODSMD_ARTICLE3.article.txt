# CAST OF SENIOR FARCE.
## Names of Students Who Will Have Parts in the Annual Play Commencement Week. 
### 
The cast for the Senior Farce to
be given on the evening of Thurs
day, May 21st, in Assembly Hall,
has been selected. The play gives
promise of surpassing every former
senior farce. It is full of action,
and every character plays an im
portant part. There are no lead
ing parts, and every one has an
equal chance for good acting. The
name of the farce has not yet been
selected.
Before each act a chorus of twen
ty-four persons will sing songs full
of local hits. Although there is
some "knocking" and joshing, it is
done in a good-natured way. A
number of duets written by Stan
ford people, graduates and under
graduates, will be sung. The fol
