# PLANS FOR BALL.
## Senior Committee Meets and Makes Arrangements for Elaborate Affair. 
### 
At a meeting of the Senior Hall
Committee held yesterday afternoon
tentative plans for the Senior Ball
were outlined. The hall promises
to fulfill its proper mission as the
crowning social event of the year.
Yanke's orchestra will furnish the
music for the dance. There will he
twenty-two numbers and a 1903
grab. The dances will be in se
quence, without the customary
extras.
Arrangements for refreshments
have not been made. In accord
ance with the scheme introduced
at the Senior Hall last year the
decorations will include a number
of booths located in the different
corners of the club-room and the
lower corridor. Encina and the
fraternities are to have representa
tion. The booths will not be pre
tentious but will 6erve as a con
venient meeting place at the
beginning of the numbers and as a
pleasant variation in the stereotyped
â€¢form of decoration. The committee
in charge of the dance includes the
following members: Miss E. A.
Peckham, Miss F. L. Arques, C. D.
Hauverman, G. Lutgerding, W. W.
Copp, and YV. G. Morrison, chair
man.
