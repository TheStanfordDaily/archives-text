# CONCERNING RESIGNATION.
## Board of Trustees Make Statement in San Francisco Papers.—Dr. Newton's Statement. 
### 
The San Francisco papers have
contained statements made by Sec
retary Crothers of the Hoard of Trus
tees concerning the resignation of
Rev. It. Heber Newton as pastor of
Memorial Church, which in sub
stance are as follows:
"The resignation was found to be
unexpected and entirely voluntary
on Dr. Newton's part. The corre
spondence showed the principal
reason to be the doctor's desire to
displace the present voluntary stu
dent choir and to substitute a paid
quartet from outside the Univer
sity. Mrs. Stanford was unwilling
to displace the student choir, in
view of the requirement in the
trust for a simple and informal
service.
"There were also some minor
reasons mentioned, such as a pref
erence for another organist, a ques
tion hs to where Dr. Jordan must
sit during the service, the number
of leaflets required each Sunday,
and a desire to change the meet
ings of the Y. M. 0. A. from the
chapel now used to the church it
self. These were deemed too un
important to warrant the acceptance
of the resignation, but added to the
demand for the displacement .of the
student choir, they made Mrs.
Stanford inclined to the expressed
wish of Dr. Newton to be relieved.
Her determination was unanimous
ly approved by the board.
"It is a fact that there were no
essential differences between Dr.
Newton and Dr. Jordan or Mrs.
Stanford, and no question of theo
logy or doctrine was concerned
during the entire pendency of the
matter."
Referring to the above, Dr.
Newton makes the statement
that he is not ready to break the
silence which he has imposed up
on himself, but that certain of
the reasons alleged for his resigna
tion are quite inaccurate: e.g., the
desire for the substitution of a paid
quartet from outside for the pres
ent voluntary student choir, and
the wish for a change of organist,—
these matters not even having en
tered into his letter; and that cer
tain other reasons are relatively
inaccurate, as having been only in
cidental to the real issue; all of
which should have been evident to
anyone before whom "the entire
correspondence lias been laid."
