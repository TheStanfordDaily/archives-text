# CONCERNING THE EPIDEMIC.
## Typhoid Patients Doing Well.â€”Doctors Believe All Cases Traceable to Use of Infected Milk. 
### 
The typhoid situation is in many
ways encouraging. Those who have
been the lowest for the last ten days,
are, with the exception of E. I,
Frisselle, '03, at the Phi Delta
Theta house, nearly all improved
and getting along as well as
could be expected. Miss E. Lew
ers was yesterday quite low, but
this morning was reported bet
ter. Almost all of those who are
regarded as the most ill need only
careful nursing in order to get
them into the convalescent stage.
R. D. Barrett, '04, whose life ten
days ago was despaired of, is grad
ually getting along toward that
stage, but is still in considerable
danger, his constitution being very
weak.
There have been in the last few
days rumors to the effect that the
theory of the doctors concerning
the origin of the cases has been
exploded. Last week Miss Alice
Richards, '05, went to San Fran
cisco with what appeared to be
symptoms of typhoid and she had
been eating at a place where milk
from the infected dairy was not
used. H. P. Kuhn, '03, and R. D.
Emerson, '03, at the Beta Theta
Pi house, have become ill. Kuhn
is in Lane Hospital in San Fran
cisco, Emerson on the campus.
Neither of these men have used
milk from the dairy in question.
I)r. Snow when seen concerning
this matter today said: "Miss
Richards has returned from San
Francisco, the doctors having de
cided that she was free from
typhoid. The examination of Kuhn
is not yet complete and it has not
heen decided that either he or
Emerson have typhoid. Even if it?
should be shown that these men
have the fever and though they
have not U6ed the milk at their
table, it is more than likely that
they received infection from other
sources. We have had a number
of cases apparently even more
baffling than these two and in every
case we have found that in some
form or another the patient used
the milk. The water that is used
on the campus has been examined
several times and is watched close
ly and is absolutely free from
typhoid germs."
Although the period of incuba
tion is ended it is not conceded
that no more canes will arise.
Many of the customers of the con
demned dairy failed to properly
disinfect the utensils used for hold
ing milk.
There have been no new cases re
ported to the Palo Alto Board of
Health since Thursday of last week.
