soon gave up his teaching to come
to Stanford for advanced study.
He was registered as a graduate
student in entomology, with bot

wealth.
Greatly handicapped at first by
his lack of facility in English,
Hirayama, by his untiring indus
try, earnestness and limitless pati
ence, had made a thorough start
in his work, and gave promise of
becoming a distinguished worker
in his special line of study. He
possessed a capacity for detailed
and accurate observation that,coup
led with his perseverance and
strong interest,would certainly have
made his work in Japan of great
worth to his country. Personally,
he was quiet and unobtrusive, but
with a clear conception of his aim
in life, and a single-minded cer
tainty of purpose. He was fast
winning friends by his kindly man
ner, honesty, and earnestness.
