seconds, and the two-twenty in:22-
4-5 with three-yard handicap.
Thomson, '03, took first place in the
half-mile in 2:00 2-5, winning from
scratch. The time in these events
was better than was made in the
Intercollegiate meet two weeks
ago. Weller, '06, took second place
in broad jump, at 21 feet 5 inches
actual distance, second place in the
hammer throw at 111 feet, and
third place in the low hurdles after
falling and injuring both knees at
the sixth hurdle while leading.
Huwley, '03, took second in three
events. In the fifty-yard dash he
finished one yard behind Abadie of

record of :05 3-5. In the hundred,
Hawley with halfyard start finished
four feet behind Abadie, who won
in 10 flat, equaling another Coast
record. In the two-twenty he took
second place from scratch, one yard
behind Dunn, 04.
J. M. Beach, '03, vaulted 31 feet
2 1-4 inches, and Wilcox of Cali

at a height of 5 feet 7 inches.
Hyde, '04, third place in the
shot-put with 41 feet 4 inches.

shot 45 feet 6 1-4 inches, which
compares well with the world's re
cord of 47 feet.
Plaw, the old California hammer
thrower, threw the 16-pound ham
mer 163 feet 10 inches, beating his
own Coast record by over three feet,
and coming within three feet of the
world's record. Irwin of the Olym
pia Club vaulted 11 feet 7 3-4
inches, equaling the Coast record
set by Norman Dole, '03, two weeks
ago. Dole was unable to compete
owing to a sprained ankle. Medals
and trophies were offered for first
