The evening of Friday, May Bth,
the Stanford Gymnasium Club will
give its annual exhibition in the
men's gymnasium. The club lias
increased in membership and the
work has been carried on more
consistently than ever before. The
class-work will be of a very high
order and the "stunts" will be
more intricate and spectacular than
usual. The whole exhibition has
been planned with a view to enter

used with many of the pieces of
apparatus. Double-work will be
made a feature of the mat-work
and tumbling. Iloyce R. Long, '05,
and Wheeler North, '04, will have
several "stunts" together. A special
feature of the exhibition is to be
the pyramid work. The club has
procured ladders so that the
pyramids will he entirely new and
