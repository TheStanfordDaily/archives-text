# LANAGAN TALKS.
## The 						Old Varsity Pitcher Will Accept Position as Head Football Coach if Squad Favor It. 
### 
At a meeting of the football men
held on the quad Friday night
steps preliminary to securing a
head coach for next season were
taken. James Lanagan, '00, has
been offered the position by Cap
tain Bansbach and Manager Ed
wards. Throughout the semester
different attempts have been made
to secure Lanagan, but until re
cently he found it impossible to
take the time from his work at Bel
mont school where he is an in
structor in Latin. As soon as he
found he could take the time each
afternoon the position was formally
offered him. Before accepting
Lanagan wished to have a meeting
of the football squad and lay the
natter before the men. He spoke
to them briefly last Friday and
outlined his position. After speak
ing of the method he proposed to
adopt next season he made his
acceptance of the position of coach
entirely dependent upon the feeling
of the squad. He said that if the
football men wished him for coach
he would so act, but that he must
decline unless he was assured that
there would be unity in the squad.
The men will meet at the end of
the week, at which time in all prob
ability the matter will be closed
and Lanagan finally secured as
coach.
Lanagan is but little known as
a football player at Stanford. He
was kept off the field in his fresh
man year by the mandate of the
doctor, who considered his heart too
weak to stand the severe strain.
He followed the game closely, how
ever, throughout his four years of
college, and has kept in close touch
since. At Belmont school, in addi
tion to liis instruction in the
classics,Lanagan has acted as coach
of both baseball and football teams.
His success while acting in this
capacity is evidenced by the long
string of victories the school foot
ball team has gained during the
last two seasons. While at college
Lanagan was a man prominent in
undergraduate affairs. He was
Varsity pitcher on the '99 and '00
teams; played on the Mandolin
Club, and was its leader for one
year. He is a member of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
