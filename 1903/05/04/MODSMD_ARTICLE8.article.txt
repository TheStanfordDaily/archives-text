# The
						"Quad" Will Appear.
## 
### 
The printing of the Quad was
finished today, at the Stanley-
Taylor Printing Company, and to
morrow it will be placed in the
hands of the binders. Their con

tract calls for delivery at the Uni
versity Monday, May 11th, and the
manager is planning to have them
on sale Tuesday. The binding is
in canvas of the cardinal color,
used in every Quad previous to
last year's edition. The cover de
sign, by H.R.Johnson, is a glimpse
of the University Church through
a foreground of eucalyptus trees.
The advertising this year is not as
large as usual. The book contains
four hundred and ten pages,â€”a
gain of fifty-eight pages over last
year's edition. The increase is due
largely to the rapid growth of
college activities, and to special
articles covering portions of our
early history that are of interest to
the pioneer classes of our second
decade.
