# Successful Band Dance.
## 
### 
Sixty-five couples danced to the
music of the University Band Sat
urday night in Mullen's Hall,
Palo Alto. The dance was one of
the prettiest of the year.
The hall was neatly decorated
with colored streamers, and the
music was near the perfection
point. The great improvement
shown by the Band since the first
attempt at playing a dance pro
gram well deserved the much
greater response which the student
body gave in support of the musi
cal organization. The proceeds of
the dance, which were all that
could have been expected, will go
toward removing the deficit that is
yet due on the recently purchased
instruments.
