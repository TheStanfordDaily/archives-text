# TRACK FOR NEXT YEAR.
## A
						Comparsion of Stanford and California Teams Shows Interesting Situation. 
### 
California enthusiasts who have
been figuring upon their prospects
in the next intercollegiate field
day concede Stanford an advan
tage, but they contend that it is a
very slight one. They believe that
an advantage may be safely claimed
by California in the matter of fresh
man stars next year, owing to the
general strength of the California
alumni in the preparatory schools
of the State, who will now he more
active than ever.
Stanford loses three point winners:
E. A. Smith, llawley, and Mc-
Caughern. California will lose all
her sprinters, Codogan, Brown,
Townsend, Dewing; and Abadie,
though a junior, is not expected to
return. Their absence leaves one
man, Johnson, to care for the
sprints, while Stanford will have
Turpin and Hamilton. Dunn also
will propably figure in the two
twenty next year.
In the quarter, California has
such men as Howard, Hartley and
Adler, none of them point winners
in the last meet, to pit against
Dunn, Grossman and Hayward.
Clifford is the only hope for Cali
fornia in the half, and lie will have
against him Thomson, winner of
the half this year.
In the distances, Tibbetts, Clif
ford, Hacklev, Edwards, Lundy,
Newhall can make a good showing.
Holman, Lovell, Stiles, and Bar
rett may be counted upon in the
finish for Stanford, liannigan is
expected to win both hurdle events,
and Meany, Frei, Hartley and
Chaplin will strive for places
against Weller and Kuhn of Stan
ford.
The field events are all to Stan
ford's advantage. California has
only Hartline and Boynton in the
hammer, against Crawford, Estes,
and Weller; and Snedigar and
Fautz, against Hyde and Crawford,
in the shot-put. Chaplin and
Neighbor in the broad jump have
good chances as against Henley,
Weller, Ball, and West; while in
the high jump Cooley may be
counted upon as a five-point man,
with Hickey a close second. Hen
ley and Abbott have records
above five feet ten inches, which
they can be expected to duplicate.
The situation in the pole-vault
and relay will remain unchanged.
Stanford will undoubtedly have
a faster relay team next year than
ever, while at California there is a
dearth of good quarter-milers. Dole
in the vault, is a man who keeps
in form the year round. With
Beach and Wilcox evenly matched
for second, and Whitaker and
Symmes for third place, the vault
should lose none of its interest next
year.
