The Senior Week Committee has
inserted in the program for the
commencement festivities two
events that should become perma
nent affairs. A class may enter
the University and, aside from the
meetings in the chapel for business,
it never gets together. In a way,
the smoker and the reunion will be
substitutes for this lack of social
intercourse. At no time in their
college careers do the men of a
class feel college fellowship more
thoroughly than when their senior
year draws to a close, and at no
time do the women feel the need of
knowing each other as they do
during their commencement week.
It has often been regretted that
social affairs of this kind were not
more numerous. A reunion for
both men and women at some fu
ture time may be made a feature of
Senior Week. The omission of the
alumni smoker from the program
was necessitated by a scarcity of
funds, but it should be taken up
again by next year's class and
made an annual affair.
