Protest after protest has been
made in regard to the "mass play"
in football, which it has been
claimed has resulted in making
the game dangerous. Should the
rules of football undergo the pro
posed change, only two men being
required to touch the ball, this
style of play would be almost en
tirely done away with. An open
style of play would be substituted
that would require greater skill
and less brute force on the part of
the players and keep the spectators
on the "qui vive" while watching

the exhibition. The work of the
committee will be commended and
the great college game made more
interesting if the proposed change
goes through.
