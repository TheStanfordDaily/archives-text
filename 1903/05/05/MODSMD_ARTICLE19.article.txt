# SERMON BY DR. NEWTON.
## The 						Divine Preached Sunday Morning: on "The Deeds of the Dreamers." 
### 
In Memorial Church Sunday
morning Dr. Newton preached on
"The Deeds of the Dreamers."
Renan deplored the fact that the
idealists rarely succeeded in life;
that the practical men carried the
day. Hut how about the years?
Immediate and transient success
is for the practical men, but suc
cess in the long run, as history will
attest, is for the men of ideas, for
the men of sentiments, for the men
of convictions.
Nothing is more pathetic in his
tory than the apparent failure of
the idealists.
Every aspect of our civilization
reveals the fact of the progress that
has been made under the impetus
of the men of ideas and sentiments
and convictions. On the material
side of our civilization, our fathers
of two generations ago would have
deemed the commonplaces of our
day utter miracles. The man who
would have predicted them would
have been remanded to an insane
asylum. The political dreamers of
our generation have wrought mar
vels surpassing all probabilities.
What a story was that of Mezzini
and his dream of new Italy. So in
the line of social reforms: when a
country gentleman of Russia be
gan his series of charming stories
through which he desired to preach
to the conscience of his people con
cerning the woes of the serfs of the
land, what a Utopian dream seemed
his hope of substantial reform! Yet
on a certain day one of these stories
fell in the hands of the Czar Alex
ander I, and it led to the ukase
which freed millions of serfs.
The story of pure ethics reveals a
similar tale. There was a time
when the ten words of Moses were
glittering generalities; when the
average morality of our savage an
cestors would have regarded such
laws as utterly impracticable.
Stealing was the habit of the day;
it was reduced to a fine art; there
was no reproach in the taking of
life. And yet these dreams of the
early ethical idealists have so far
materialized that our common law
embodies them today. The story
of religion reveals the same pro
gress, under the guidance of the
dreamers of earth. Jesus was the
prince of idealists, his Utopian
dream of spiritual religion and
super-earthly morality is already
taking possession of the soul and
the conscience of mankind and
promises yet a realization on the
earth.
