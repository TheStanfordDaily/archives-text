# May Raise Price of "Quad."
## 
### 
At a meeting of the claps of 1904
held in the University chapel this
afternoon, steps were taken pre
paratory to considering the finan
cial condition of this year's Quad.
At present there seems to be a pos
sibility that the Quad may not pay
expenses. While the cost of pub
lishing the book has been as great
as heretofore, the advertising sec
tion is smaller than usual.
Acting upon a preliminary state
ment by Manager Henley, Presi
dent Blodget called a meeting of the
class to consider what means should
be used to prevent a deficit.
A committee consisting of I). C.
Wiley, W. F. Dunn and M. E. I)e
Witt, chairman, was appointed to
look into the financial condition of
the annual. They will report to
the class next Friday, when the
price of the book will be placed at
a figure that will insure the Jun
iors from loss.
