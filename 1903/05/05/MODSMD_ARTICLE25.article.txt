Dr. \V. F. Snow haa the follow
ing to say concerning the present
situation of the epidemic:
"The reports from typhoid pa
tients are uniformly favorable this
afternoon. Two new students have
been placed in the Guild hospitals.
Both have been under observation
for the past week. Miss A. M.
Dowty, '06, and F. E. Whitney, '06,
were both among those drinking
the infected milk. The reports of
new caseß at the Beta house are
unfounded save in the case of Kuhn,
who is under observation in Lane
Hospital. Too much stress should
not be placed upon a definite date
as the close of the incubation
period, as it is impossible to say
just when stray cream bottles and
milk cans from the infected dairieß
were all disinfected. Physicians
anticipate in every outbreak of
typhoid a certain number of cases
in which no explanation of the
source of infection is possible.
However, there has been no definite
case of typhoid up to the present
time in which it has been possible
to exclude infection through the
milk used."
The patients today are reported
much improved. Chas. Paxton,
who has been among the sickest,
awoke this morning with all symp
toms of pneumonia and spinal
meningitis gone. Miss Lewers and
Miss Bean, who are also at the
Y. W. C. A. club-house, are better.
With E. I. Frisselle perforation
has set in and his life has been
despaired of. Yesterday the street
in front of the Phi Delta Theta
house was closed. Specialists from
San Francisco after examination
decided that an operation would
be impossible. Today, although
very low, the sick man is better.
Instructor Moreno of the Math
ematics department went to San
Francisco this morning having the
symptoms of typhoid.
