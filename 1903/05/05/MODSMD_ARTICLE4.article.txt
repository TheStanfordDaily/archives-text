# THE
						FRENCH PLAY.
## A
						Short Discussion of the Comedy, Its Plot, Purpose, and Characteristic Situations. 
### 
Edward Pailleron, the author of
"Le Monde ou Ton S'ennuie," has
written nothing that equals this
play, llis strength lies in the wit
of iiis dialogue and in the skill
with which lie has arranged the
clever plot of the present play in
order to satirize the hysterical and
superficial show of learning and
literature pervading society.
"Le Monde ou l'on S'ennuie," in
sufficiently translated as "The
world is bored," is "the
society where pedantry takes the
place of learning, affectation that
of true feeling, where people never
say what they think and never
think what they say; where devo
tion indicates political scheming,
friendship is calculation, and even
courtship but a means to an end."
To lay bare the weak sides of
this superficiality, Pailleron has
chosen the salon of Mine, de Ceran,
herself superficial, and has sur
rounded her with people of her own
kind. There is the poet whose
forthcoming volume of verse draws
cries of ecstasy from his admirers,
there is Lucy the young English
woman, who revels in metaphysical
discussions, the lady who quotes
Joubert, the men who seek political
promotion, and above all Bellac,
the professeur pour domes, who with
his empty phrases causes his fash
ionable audience to faint away with
admiration.
The saner side of life is repre
sented by the Duchesse de R<3ilie,
who with unsparing wit holds up
to ridicule the pretence which she
sees about her; by Paul Raymond,
who has brought his young wife
Jeanne there for a visit because he
recognizes that his opportunity for
political appointment lies here; by
Roger de Ceran, who can under
stand nothing of what he sees
about him; and above all by Su
zanne, who is natural and herself
without airs and pretensions.
Depending as it does upon the
lines rather than upon the situa
tion, the play is simple in plot.
A reading of the play before the
performance will not be essential,
though by so doing a person will
get more satisfaction from the eve
ning's entertainment.
The tickets for the play will be
put on sale Thursday morning on
the quad, at the Bookstore, and at
the Palace Pharmacy in Palo Alto.
The prices will be 75 and 50 cents.
The proceeds of the play will go
to the Students' Guild.
