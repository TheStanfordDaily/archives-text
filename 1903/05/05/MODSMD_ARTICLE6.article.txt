# Chaplain Gardner Will Lecture.
## 
### 
Wednesday evening at 7:30 Rev.
D. Charles Gardner will speak in
room 2 on the "Assize Courts of
England." Although primarily
intended for students of the Law
department, the lecture will not be
of a technical nature which would
prevent the general public from
being interested. While not a
continuation in substance of the
series of lectures delivered by Dr.
Abbott, the idea of speaking to the
Law men was suggested to Chap
lain Gardner by the informal talks
on "Courts-ofjlnn."
Himself at one time a student of
law in England, Chaplain Gardner
draws the material for his talk
from his personal experiences. The
Assize Courts of England have juris
diction over a class of cases that
cover much profitable ground, and
a presentation of the inner work
ings of these courts cannot fail to
be productive of general interest.
