# Proposed Change of Rules.
## 
### 
Football will bo revolutionized
next fall if the new rule proposed
by the intercollegiate committee
goes into effect. By the proposed
rule only two men need to touch the
ball. This means that the center
may snap the ball to any man on
the team. It will also allow the
quarter-back to run with the ball,
which is an important innovation.
Experts declare that the game for
the first season at least will resolve
itself into the puzzle: "Who's got
the ball." ,
The dangerous mass-play, which
has aroused so much opposition,
will be largely done away with,
and open play will take its place.
