### 
The Stanford Alumnus for May
is out. With no special articles of
any kind, there is a full chronicle
of the events of the month in de
hating, athletics, etc. A list of
articles published by Stanford
alumni, which has been compiled
by the Library authorities, appears
as an indication of what Stanford
men and women are doing in that
line of work. An interesting fea
ture of the Alumnus is a full-page
map of the campus and an outline
map of the quadrangle; the
growth in building during the past
decade ia made clearer to the absent
alumni than could be done in any
other way. The June number will
be devoted entirely to the graduat
ing class, its history, its achieve
ments, with sketches of its more
prominent members.
