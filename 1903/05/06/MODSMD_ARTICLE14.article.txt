The action of the faculty in
turning over to the student body
full control of the last Assembly of
the year is significant for several
reasons. It is significant because
it is the first of annual oppor
tunities for the expression of under
graduate opinion. The student
may give vent to those things that
lie has to say to the faculty that
can not be said in the college jour
nals, sentiments which too often
are kept in the background. Ulti
mately the speakers will be chosen
entirely from among those men
and women in the graduating class
who have something to say, whose
experience in student affairs has
been such as to give them a broad,
comprehensive view of the problems
which the oncoming classes must
face. There are things in the stu
dent life at Stanford which a
senior would wish to commend,
and he will speak of things in
which he hopes to see improvement.
Commendation and criticism cried
out, as it will be cried out, from
men and women, who are thorough
representatives of every student
activity and enterprise, will have a
large influence on the policy of the
student body and on the members of
the student body in their relation
to the faculty and student activities
and enterprises.
We will welcome the speakers
from the University of California.
There should be between Stanford
and the State University a feeling
of greatest courtesy. If Stanford's
attitude toward the sister institu
tion is not what it should be, may
her representatives tell us of it
when the opportunity is offered
them the fifteenth of May.

It is a man with little college
spirit who at this critical juncture
in the history of the University
systematically starts rumors or al
lows rumors to start. The Univer
sity needs the support of every
loyal Stanford man and woman.
It is not from loyalty to Stanford
that the report is circulated that
there are hundreds of cases of
fever in Palo Alto, that the author
ities are withholding facts and
keeping the students on the campus
when they should be sent to their
homes. These rumors are ground
less. The doctors have from the
first been absolutely frank concern
ing their investigations and the
cases in their charge, and have con
sistently volunteered information.
The situation is not now as serious
as it was two weeks or a week ago
and nothing has occurred not in
accordance with the predictions of
the doctors.
