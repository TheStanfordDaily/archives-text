# Concerning the Epidemic.
## 
### 
The typhoid situation today is
practically unchanged. No new
cases have been reported, and all
serious cases have a favorable out
look. E. I. Frisselle, '03, is some
what improved, and R. I). Barrett,
'04, is still holding his own, with
excellent prospects of recovery.
Charles Paxton, '06, and Miss E.
Lewers,'o6, are both seriously ill
but are in no immediate danger.
E. E. Miller, '04, is convalescing.
At Lane hospital Ray Barnelt,
'04, and Roy Standish, '06, are
able to be moved in wheel-chairs,
and 11. A. Sprague, '04, will be in
the convalescent ward within ten
days. Miss Cutter '04, is still in
a serious condition. All the other
patients at the hospital are doing
well.
The physicians at Lane hospital
have decided that H. P. Kuhn, '03,
who was taken down last week,has
the typhoid. There has been con
siderable question concerning the
source of infection in Kuhn's case,
he having used no milk from the
condemned dairy. Yesterday it
was ascertained that while on a
tramp in the hills back of Mayfield
he drank from the stream which
runs through the Nunez ranch and
which is conceded to have become
infected with typhoid germs.
There are several cases among
the children of the faculty, none of
them, however, of recent develop
ment or of serious aspect. At the
home of Professor Newcomer there
are two; at Professor Starbuck's,
one; at Professor Show's, one; at
Professor Johnston's, one; at Dr.
Angell's, one; at Professor Wing's,
two; and at Chaplain Gardner's,
one. Charlie, the ten-year-old son
of Dr. Angell, has been very low
but today is reported somewhat im
proved.
