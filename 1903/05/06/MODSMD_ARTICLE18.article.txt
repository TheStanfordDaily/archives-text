# Follow Dr. McLean's Advice.

### 
The Canadian Parliament has
recently passed several important
legislative acts on railway rate
grievances based upon the advisory
reports compiled by Prof. S. J.
McLean of the Department of
Economics. In 1898-99 Dr. Mc-
Lean did considerable advisor}'
work for the department of rail
ways and canals, Canada, and in
1901 was appointed special com
missioner on railway rate griev
ances. In the latter position he
prepared several reports on which
the late legislation has been based.
