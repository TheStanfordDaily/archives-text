### 
Commander Booth-Tucker of the
Salvation Army will address the
students tomorrow afternoon, May
7th, at 3.30 in the chapel on the
subject of "Salvation Army Work
in the United States."
Booth-Tucker is especially inter
esting in connection with the social
work undertaken by the organiza
tion of which he is the head in the
United States. Under his leader
ship during the last few years the
movement has extented in this
country from under fifty institu
tions to nearly two hundred and
fifty at the present time, and in
accommodation from nine hundred
persons to over nine thousand. As
a man and a public speaker he is
everywhere successful, full of up
to-date ideas, which he helps enliv
en with ready wit. Before entering
the work in which he is at present
engaged he held the position of
judge in one of the judicial districts
in Her Majesty's service in India,
and it was from the work of the
Salvation Army in India that he
was called to the United States.
