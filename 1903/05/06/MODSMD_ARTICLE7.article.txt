# Professor Smith's Trip.
## 
### 
James Perrin Smith of the De
partment of Mineralogy and Pa
leontology will leave the Univer
sity at the end of the semester for
an extended trip into southeastern
Idaho in search of paleontological
specimens. He will cooperate with
John C. Merriam of the University
of California, who is also collecting
both for hi niseif and for his uni
versity. The two men will devote
all the summer to the work. Mer
riam will devote himself to the col
lection of fossil reptiles, while Pro
fessor Smith will seek fossil am
monites. Most of the work will he
done about Soda Springs and Paris.
Recently from that country were
sent a number of very good speci
mens to Professor Smith. It is
Professor Smith's hope that the
present expedition will result in
the discovery of still further spfeci
imens, and perhaps even of entirely
new genera.
In 1900 Professor Smith was in
Idaho, and at that timediscovered a
number of new species and a few
new genera.
