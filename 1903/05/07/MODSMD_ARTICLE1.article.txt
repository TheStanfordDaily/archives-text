# E.I. FRISSELLE DIES.
## Funeral Services Over Deceased Held in Memorial Church This Afternoon. 
### 
After an illness extending over
four weeks, and a heroic struggle
ogainst inevitable death for the
past five days, Edward Irving
Frisselle was made the ninth vic
tim of the typhoid epidemic at
eleven o'clock last night. The
word of attending physicians that
the patient had little or no hope of
recovery prepared friends and rela
tives for the end several days ago.
However, the sufferer struggled
against the worst so long that
some slight chance of his life
was anticipated until last night,
when his condition grew rapidly
worse.
The deceased was a son of Mr. R.
Krisselle, a prominent fruit expert
of Fresno. He was born at Syra
cuse, New York, in 1879. Before
coming to Stanford he attended
the Kern county high school at
Bakersfield, where he graduated in
1899. In September of the same
year he entered Stanford with the
class of 1903, and was a candidate
for the Bachelor of Arts degree
from the Department of Physiology
on the 28th of this month.
Frisselle was a member of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity. . He
leaves three brothers and a father.
Two of his brothers, Ralph D. and
Samuel P. Frisselle, are in college
and will graduate this month. The
latter has been suffering from
typhoid, but has almost recovered.
Mrs. Frisselle, mother of the de
ceased, was well known on the
campus, having been matron of
Phi Delta Theta year before last.
She died at her home in Fresno
last winter.
Funeral services over the body of
E. Irving Frisselle were held in
Memorial Church at 4:30 this after
noon under the direction of Rev.
Gardner. A large assembly of
friends was present to pay their
last respects to their fellow student.
The body was taken to San Fran
cisco on the 8:09 train and sent
from there to Bakersfield, where
funeral services will be held to
morrow at the Bakersfield Congre
gational Church.
It is impossible in a few words to
show an adequate appreciation of
such a man as was Irving Frisselle.
None better than his fraternity
brothers and the members of his
family know the unselfish spirit
which characterized his relations
with those about him. To the
student body at large he was known
best by his manly bearing, his
quiet dignity, his devotion to prin
ciple. As a student his record was
enviable, and one of the saddest
phases of the death is that he
should be cut off even within a
month of the time he would have re
ceived his degree and* gone forth to
his chosen life-work.
