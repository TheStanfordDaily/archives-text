The suggestion made in a com
munication to the Daily Palo
Alto, printed in another column,
that all who attend the Senior class
ball shall walk, and turn over to
the Students' Guild the money
that they would have expended
upon carriage hire, is an excellent
one. It. is probable that the Ball
will beheld in the Encina gymna
sium, and no one residing on the
campus will be inconvenienced in
the least in getting there on foot.
The women certainly will not ob
ject; they have shown lately that
they are in no wise behind the men
in what we term Stanford spirit.
Probably in no other way could
the students afford such material
aid to the Guild with less sacrifice.
Not a carriage should be seen on
the campus the night of the dance.
