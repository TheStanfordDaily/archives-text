### 
In his report to the Board of
Supervisors, Dr. Win. Simpkins,
healtli officer for Santa Clara coun
ty, has the following:
The time and attention of your
Health Officer for the month of
April has been largely given to an
endeavor to help control the epi
demic of typhoid fever at Palo Alto
and Stanford University. A per
sonal interview was had with Gov
ernor Pardee, and on his recom
mendation Dr. Foster of the State
Board of Health was consulted by
telephone in order if possible to se
cure a State examination of the
water and milk in the infected
districts. As this could not be
done, and the delay in reports from
samples sent to San Francisco was
great, samples were sent to Garden
City Sanitarium, and satisfactory
evidence that the fault originated
in tbe water used in washing cans
at the dairies. These were at once
closed, and the origin of every case
has been traced. Dr. It. L. Wilbur
at Stanford and Drs. Moss and Black
at Palo Alto, with the assistance of
Secretary J. W. Roller of the Palo
Alto Board of Health, were prompt
and thorough in their measures,
and to them is largely due the fact
that no cases are developing. Tbe
dairies having been cleansed and
all their utensils disinfected, their
old wells sealed, their corrals and
milking places moved to new water
supply, are being allowed to re
sume business.
