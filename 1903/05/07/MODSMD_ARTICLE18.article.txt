# The
						Typhoid Situation.
## 
### 
Dr. Snow reports that the patients
are either improving or holding
their own. No new cases have
been reported, and several who
have been critically ill are better.
The reports in San Jose papers
that many canes have recently con
tracted the disease from direct con
tagion is absolutely without foun
dation. The crises in a large
majority of cases occur this week,
so a speedy decrease in the number
of those seriously ill may be con
fidently predicted.
