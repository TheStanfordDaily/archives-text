# Gymnasium Will be "At Home."
## 
### 
The Gymnasium Club will give
it√ü annual exhibition to the stu
dents and faculty of the University
Friday evening in Encina gymnas
ium. As usual, no admittance fee
will be charged. This exhibition
is the culmination of the year's
work of the club, and the evening's
performances have been planned
with a view to entertaining the
club's guests.
The work will consist of class
work and stunts on the parallel
bars, horizontal bar, horse, mat,
long-horse, and rings. Pyramids,
both common and ladder, will be a
feature of the exhibition. A speci
alty has been made of double tumb
ling. There will be a wrestling
bout between Chita, the wrestling
instructor, and another Japanese.
A unique feature of the evening's
work will be a boxing bout of a
round or two.
The University Band will play
during the exhibition.
The work will be fast and in
every way spectacular. One piece
of apparatus will be going at a
time, so that the attention of the
spectators will not be distracted.
The work of the club has pro
gressed greatly during the last
year. Stunts that a few months
ago could be done by but a few
members are now the common
property of the whole club. So the
class work of the club will be of a
high order and the stunts will be
for the most part better than ever
before.
