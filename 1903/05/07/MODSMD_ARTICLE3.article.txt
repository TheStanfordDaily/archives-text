# BASEBALL AVERAGES.
## Roosevelt Leads the Team in Batting and Fielding.â€”Stick-Work Poor. 
### 
The averages at bat and in the
field of the men who took part in
the scheduled baseball games of
the season are of unusual interest.
They show that at the bat the in
dividual players are lamentably
weak,while in the field the averages
are of a much higher grade. Roose
velt took part in five games and
accepted nine chances in the field
with an average of 1000. At the
bat he secured five hits, which
gives him a record of 333. Wil
liams, Cowden, and Copp, taking
into consideration the number of
games played, have the best record
at the bat; while Cowden, Lowen
thal, and McGilvray have fielded
well throughout the season. The
records include those of every man
who played in a scheduled game.
The abbreviations are as follows:
G., A.8., 11., P. 0., A., E., and P.,
standing for games played, times
at bat, hits, put-outs, assists, errors,
and percentages.

A comparison between the aver
ges of litis season and those of last
shows that the men who did the
best work at the bat last year, this
year fell down, without exception.
Last season Lowenthal led with
an average of 349, Crawford and
McGilvray following in close order.
This season both McGilvray and
Lowenthal are well down the list.
In the field there was a general
improvement among the players,
eight men only fielding over .900
last season, while this year twelve
passed the coveted mark. The man
on the team who showed the great
est individual improvement was
Copp, who raised his position at

the bat from eleventh place to a
tie with Cowden for fourth, and
who also raised his record in the
field from .722, the lowest on the
list, to .921, a place well up among
the leaders.
