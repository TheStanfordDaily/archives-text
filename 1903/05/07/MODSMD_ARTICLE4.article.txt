The rehearsals for "Le Monde
ou l'on S'ennuie" show that the
presentation of the play Tues
day night will exhibit not only
clever acting, but a keen apprecia
tion and interpretation of the well
worked up situatious.
Today Mies Mercedes de Luna,
'05, who has a part in the play,was
called to Los Augeles by the ill
ness of her brother, but in all prob
ability she will return before the
evening of the last dress rehearsal.
As in the French theater, the
ushering will be done by girls who
will in dress and action carry out
the impression which the cast will
strive for —that of an evening in a
modern French comedy-house.
The scenery, which was brought
from the Columbia theater in San
Francisco, arrived today and will
aid materially in the ease and grace
of presentation.
