# Students' Guild Statement.
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Friends of the Guild having
asked for a summary of the ex
penses and resources of the Guild,
the following figures are given to
answer these queries:
Up to this date the Students'
Guild has had to fully equip and
carry on three temporary hospitals.
This equipment has cost about
$1100; medicines and medical sup
plies, $300; nurses and their living
expenses, $800; a total of about
$2200.
We had in the beginning $750,
and subscriptions to the amount of
$400 have come in, so that at the
present there is a deficit of $1050.
The running expenses of the
Guild are approximately $400 per
week.
Estimates by Dr. Snow, based on
the present status of the work, will
increase tins deficit to between
$2500 and $3000 before the Guild
work is done.
It is hoped that this statement
will impress upon the community
the need which the Guild now has
of funds. We need money and
need it badly.
Frank L. Hess, President.
