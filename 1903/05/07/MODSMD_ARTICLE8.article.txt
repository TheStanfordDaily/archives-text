# REV. GARDNER TALKS.
## Chaplain Addresses Law Students on the "Assize Courts of England." 
### 
Rev. D. Charles Gardner gave
an informal talk to the Law stu
dents of the University in room 2
last night. Rev. Gardner was a
student of law in England prior to
his departure for this country, and
his lecture was drawn largely from
his personal experiences. During
the period of his study in England
Chaplain Gardner came in close
touch with many problems that
confront a new lawyer. He gave a
synopsis of the system of courts in
England, the relations between a
lawyer and his clients, and the in
side workings of a lawyer's office,
lie spoke of the fact that there are
no law schools comparable to the
ones in this country, but that there
is a personal relation between a
student of law and the man under
whom he is receiving instruction.
The chaplain included many amus
ing stories and personal experi
ences in his lecture. These were
valuable and interesting in show
ing the peculiar features of the
practice of law in England. The
assize courts, upon which the Rev.
Gardner particularized in his talk,
are circuit courts established
throughout the different districts of
England. The lawyers who travel
on these circuits compose some of
the best legal talent of England,
and their advent at the different
stopping points on the circuit is
attended with the formalities which
are the tribute to the high charac
ter of the profession and those en
gaged in it. Chaplain Gardner spoke
to the students on the invitation of
Phi Delta Phi, which has aimed
throughout the year to have a
monthly address on some subject
of a legal nature. This address
concludes the series for the year.
