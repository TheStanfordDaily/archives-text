Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin wish to
express their appreciation of the
kindness of the multitude of friends
in the Uuniversity and town, who
have ministered to their comfort
and to the care of their daughter
in her late illness. All these things
have blended together and have
made an atmosphere in which best
thoughts could grow. They feel
that they can never know how
much their power to think all the
time has been due to true, kind
friends, even to the little girls who
brought handfuls of flowers.
