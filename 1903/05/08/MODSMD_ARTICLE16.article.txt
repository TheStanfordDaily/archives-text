To avoid a deficit and in order
that the editor and manager may
have something for their work, the
Juniors this afternoon raised the
price of the annual. Up to last
year managers always came out
well ahead. This year the adver
tising pages could not be filled, and
the accustomed revenue therefrom
has been lacking. This is due to
the ruinous system which managers
have followed. As long as the
advertising contracts are turned
over to professionaPadvertisers, the
Quad and every other Stanford
publication must suffer. The cost
of printing the book exceeds the
price ordinarily asked of the stu
dents for copies. This has always
been the greatest obstacle to bring
ing out an edition large enough to
satisfy the wants of the U Diversity,
as the managers have argued that
to print any beyond six hundred
would mean a loss on every copy
sold. It might be well suggested
that the Juniors, while raising the
price of the book above the cost of
printing, would have done no
discredit to themselves had they
done so a month ago, and ordered
an increased edition to accommo
date the entire college, instead of
turning out so few that more than
half the college will be denied the
right of owning the publication.
The class of 1905, through the
committee which has it in charge,
may see that the demand is sup
plied and thereby set a precedent
which should have been set some
years ago.
