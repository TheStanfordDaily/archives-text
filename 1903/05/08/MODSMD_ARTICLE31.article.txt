# MORE ON FRENCH PLAY.
## The 						Cast for the Comedy.—Ready for Presentation Tuesday Night. Miss de Luna Will Return. 
### 
"Le Monde ou l'ou S'ennuie,"
which the French Club will put on
in Assembly Hall Tuesday night,
for the benelit of the Students'
Guild, has had most thorough in
struction. As was the case with
the English play, the cast of "Le
Monde ou l'on S'ennuie" comprises
no professionals, nor has there been
any professional coaching, Professor
Searles having had charge of the
rehearsals, and Dr. Matzke and
Dr. Frein having assisted.
The cast of characters is rather
complex and it would be hard to
say which are the star parts.
Bellac, the professor who talkß
platonic love, gives W.J. Stack an
opportunity for good acting —an
opportunity which is not neglected.
The two longest parts —those of La
Duchesse de Reville and La Com
tesse de Ceran —will be taken by
Mrs. Rouiller and Miss Louise
Mourot, '02. Miss de Luna makes
a charming Suzanne, a role which
will probably be understood better
than any of the others, inasmuch
as it is full of action. Suzanne,
eighteen years old, unaffected, and
lively, has just escaped from the
convent for the third time. She is
tired of being treated like a child,
and it is only through the Duchess
that she finally receives her due.
Miss Dorothy Abbott fills well the
part of the cold English girl, Lucy
Watson; and Jeanne Raymond is
taken by Miss Chita Kraft. Of the
male characters, two of the best are
Paul Raymond, in which L. G.
Levy is doing some good acting, and
Saint Reault, very satisfactorily
portrayed by W. G. Schulte.
