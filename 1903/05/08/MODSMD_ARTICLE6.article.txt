# Booth-Tucker Speaks.

### 
Commander Booth-Tucker of the
Salvation Army addressed the stu
dents in the chapel yesterday after
n >on. He showed that there had
been a decided growth in the Salva
tion Army during the last seven
years,—that it now cares for 10,000
people. Last year its expenses
were nearly $500,000, of which
$450,000 was raised by the Salva
tion Army itself.
The aim of the Salvation Army
is to procure work and salvation
for all, and to raise all unfortun
ates to a standard where they own
homes and have high ideals of
family life. To obtain this aim,
Booth-Tucker thinks that coloniza
tion is often the true solution, and
that a large amount of capital will
be invested in colonization, for it
yields large profitß. The Salvation
Army has three farms, one in New
Mexico, one in Colorado, one in
California. The value of the land
in the Colorado tract has increased
from two and three dollars an acre
to nearly a hundred.
When people are taken from the
city and placed on these farms,
they almost invariably prove indus
trious and become quite well off.
This is the case especially when
families take up a farm.
The colonists are only loaned the
money and gradually pay it back
to the Salvation Army by theearn
ings from their lands.
Booth-Tucker claims that by far
the majority of drunkards, tramps,
and all seemingly worthless per
sons, when given a chance on these
farms, or in the industrial homes,
become good citizens. He predicts
that there is a great future for the
colonization plan.
