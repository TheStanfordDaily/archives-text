## Action Taken at This Afternoon at Junior Meeting to Prevent Deficit. 
### 
At a meeting of the Juniors held
in the chapel the class voted to
raise the price of the 1904 Quad for
persons outside the class from $2
to $2.50. Those of the class who
have paid their assessment will be
allowed to buy the book at $1.50
as originally decided.
The report of M. C. DeWitt,
chairman of the committee of three
appointed by the president of the
class to examine the books of Man
ager Henley, showed that at the
price of $2 to those outside the
class, the manager and editor would
receive practically nothing for their
work, while raising the fee to $2.50
would enable them to receive slight
compensation and at the same time
the chance of the class being thrown
into debt would be avoided. 11. M.
Lewis made the motion that the
price of the annual be raised.
The book is nearly ready to
leave the hands of the printers.
Owing to the fact that Tuesday
will be a holiday, the book will un
doubtedly be placed on sale on the
quad YVednesday or Thursday
