# Festivities May be Curtailed.
## 
### 
The Senior Week Committee has
voted to recommend to the class
which it represents that the festivi
ties of Senior Week, except the
Senior Farce, the Senior Ball, and
the Class Day exercises, be omitted
this year. This action has been
taken out of respect for the memory
of those who have died during the
typhoid epidemic.
If there is a surplus in the class
treasury at the end of the year it
will be turned over to the Students'
Guild.
On account of the number of ty
phoid cases now in the Guild hos
pital above the Encina club-room,
it will he necessary to give the
Senior Ball in Encina gymnasium.
The class will meet Monday at
1:15 in order to hear the report of
the committee.
