Foster Ely Prackett, '03, the
sixth victim of the typhoid
epidemic among the students, died
in the Guild hospital at Encina
early yesterday morning. lie had
been seriously ill for over a week,
but hopes were entertained for his
recovery until spinal meningitis
set in, resulting in death within a
few hours.
Brackett came to Stanford two
years ago with advanced standing
from Columbian University. He
was a student in the Latin depart
ment and a member of the Udiversi
ty Orchestra. His father, Dr. John
E. Prackett, is a retired army sur
geon of Washington, D. C. His
mother arrived several days ago
and was with him at the time of
his death. His body was taken
East for interment early this morn
ing.
Funeral services were held in
Memorial Church yesterday after
noon. The body was carried from
Encina Hall by student bearers,
whose ranks were made up of stu
dents from Washington, Prackett's
home, and from members of Encina
Club. Among the musical num
bers was"The Dead March from
Saul" by Handel, the favorite
composer of the deceased. After
the services Dr. Newton pronounced
the benediction and the audience
left the church while the burial
party remained with the coffin un
til it was taken to Palo Alto.
Chaplain Gardner's address was
011 "The Christian Idea of Death."
He prefaced his address with a
sympathetic reference to the sad
features of the epidemic. In Cal
ifornia old age and denth are al
most strangers; we enjoy that life
with all that makes life dear —
health, happiness, youth, ambition.
We would take no single joy from
life, nor add one note of sadness to
the soul of youth. Yet experiences
as the death of our comrade, re
mind us forcibly of the shortness
and uncertainty of human life.
Death is an absolute certainty,
an experience none can escape, and
men and women should sometime
calmly face the idea of death and
prepare to meet it in their own
home and in their own experience.
Death affects the physical body
only, not the spirit. The spirit
survives the work of death and
passes into light and life in a
world unseen. Pelief in a life after
death is a cardinal principle of
Christianity, a principle which
finds confirmation in our instinct
ive longing for immortality. The
idea of eternal life is the vision of
God promised in the scriptures.
The heavenly life is a life with
Christ and the loved ones gone be
fore. In pureness, in knowledge,
in spiritual self-culture, prepare
now for the life of the world to
come.
