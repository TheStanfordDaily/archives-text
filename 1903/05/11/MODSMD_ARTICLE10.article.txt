This morning Dr. Snow visited
Lane hospital and found H. A.
Sprague out of doors, 11. G.
Barnett almost ready to start for
his home in the East, and R. P.
Standish so far convalescent that
he will be on the campus before the
end of the week. Kuhn is very
sick, but not dangerously so. Waite
and Miss Cutter are the most seri
ously ill.
The patients on the campus and
most of those in Palo Alto are
doing well. Miss Lewers is slightly
improved. Anderson at the Y. W.
C. A. Clubhouse and Edwards at
the Waverly street hospital are in
critical conditions.
A. B. Swinerton, ex-'O4, who
left the campus during vacation for
Annapolis Naval Acadamy, is re
ported as down with the fever.
