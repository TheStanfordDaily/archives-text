mond and bis wife arrive,and after
some conversation describing the
tone of the house where they have
come to stay, are introduced to
the Comtesse de C6rau, their host
ess. who enterw upon the scene ab
sorbed in political conversation
with Saint Heault. They are soon
joined by the Duchesse de Reville,

wlioße witty conversation permits
a clear conception of the members
of this salon; by Lucy and by Roger
de C6rau, son of the countess, just
back from a scientific journey.
When Suzanne appears she en
ters upon the scene with a charac
teristic outburst of natural impetu
osity, which is severely rebuked by
Mine, de Cerau. After a scene be
tween Suzanne and Roger, where
neither can understand the other,
Bellac appears followed by a crowd
of his female admirers, whose ac
clamations of ecstatic admiration
at once reestablish the usual tone
of superficiality of the salon. But
before the curtain falls on this act,
Suzanne, who loves Roger, though
quite unconscious of the fact, has
found the letter for which Lucy has
been looking and suspects Roger of
an intrigue with the latter, while
Roger, through a stratagem of the
duchess, has seen the same letter
and imagines it addressed to Su
zanne.
ACT 11.
The members of Mine, de C6rau's
circle have assembled for a literary
evening, and as the curtain rises
they are listening to a lecture by
Saint R6ault. Everybody is dread
fully bored and yet endeavors to
persuade everybody else of his
great enjoyment. In a portion of
this scene where Suzanne appears
particularly solicitous for the fav
ors of Hellac, Roger's suspicions
take a more definite form, and fin
ally he is led to suspect a liaison
between the two, and lie decides to
watch and interview them that eve
ning.
ACT 111.
The scene has changed to the
conservatory adjoining the salon of
Mine, de Corau. The suspected in
terview was to take place there
between Bel lac and Lucy, but Paul
and Jeanne Raymond, separated
by the customs of the house, have
thought of this same method of
having a private chat. Suzanne
and Roger, suspicious of each other,
are brought to the place, but are

led finally to an understanding
through the aid of the duchess, who
lias been an interested witness of
the Bcenes in the conservatory. The

play ends with a general clearing
u[» of the mysteries of the situation,
but brings no change in the tone of
the salon, which remains as before
