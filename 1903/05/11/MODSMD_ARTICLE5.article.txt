# GYMNASTS PERFORM.
## Gymnasium Club Did "Stunts" of Unusually High Order Friday Night. 
### 
At the Gymnasium Club exhibi
tion held in Encina gymnasium
Friday evening the gymnasts
showed an immense amount of prep
aration, for every movement went
like clock-work. Throughout the
"stunts" were of the spectacular
kind, those that take gymnastic
skill and have in them an element
of danger. The men were daring
on every piece of apparatus, yet sys
tematic and scientific. The ease with
which every man of the club did
his part in the performances drew
continuous applause.
The exhibition differed in every
way from other exhibitions given
by the Gymnasium Club not only
in the finished excellence of each
performance but in the variety.
Work was done on the parallel
bars, the rings, the horse, the hori
zontal bar, and the mat. The club
made a specialty of pyramid work,
both with and without ladders.
The mat-work in which two-man
and three-man "stunts" were done
was especially pleasing to the aud
ience.
As special features three eventa
were introduced: a wrestling match
between Chiba and Yoshimi, and a
fencing bout between Yafuni and
Kawai, all Japanese students; and
a boxing match between J. G.
Dehy, '03, and F. G. Smith, '05.
The wrestling and fencing were
novelties much appreciated.

took part were R. R. Long, '05, H.
