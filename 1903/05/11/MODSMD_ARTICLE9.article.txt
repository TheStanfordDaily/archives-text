The question which faces the
members of the Senior class is a
serious one and one which needs
thought. There are many phases,
many possible contingencies, many
things to be considered. There is
the memory and respect for those
who are dead, there are matters of
expense,and the effect on the public.
The sentiment of the class as a
whole has not been expressed, but
the different aspects were brought
out in today's meeting. The Senior
class has on hand from assess
ments about $350 with other assess
ments still to be paid, enough to
meet all obligations. Dr. Jordan
lias suggested that the University
close one day early and that Com
mencement be held Monday in
stead of Wednesday. So far noth
ing has been done. The class can
drop from the schedule any of the
festivities it desires, but it is more
than probable that the list of grad
uates cannot be made out so that
Commencement can be held earlier
than the 21st. The chief argument
for dropping any festivity is that
thereby respect is shown the dead,
and an appreciation of the great
strain laid upon the University
and those ill, made evident. On
the other hand it is said that by
suspending festivities the adverse
criticism of the public will be en
hanced, it being thought that the
newspapers will take the action as
one of panic rather than one of re
spect. Those who have talked with
outsiders claim that it will not be
taken as a sign of panic, that some
sign of respect is expected, and the
newspaper correspondents can

emphasize the truth in the matter.
These things must he well con
sidered before action is taken. Dr.
Jordan will meet the class at 8:15
tomorrow, and not a single senior
should fail to attend.
