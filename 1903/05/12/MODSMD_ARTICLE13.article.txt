# THE 						1904 "QUAD."
## Annual a Well-Rounded Year-Book. Many Commendable Features. On Sale Tomorrow. 
### 
The tenth volume of the Stan
ford Quad is out of the bindery,
and in the hands of the reviewers.
The book is an excellent one, well
illustrated, well balanced, well
edited, and well rounded. The ed
itor throughout has striven for a
higher standard of year-book.
The older the institution, the more
firm its traditions and standing,
the less does its annual make of
personalities and special features.
Its sole aim is that of a recorder of
things that have been done. To
make out of the Quad a year-book
far departed from the preparatory
school "josh" annual, the editors
have emphasized statistics, making
the book of peculiar value as a
compendium. In accuracy of de
tail the Quad this year is so far
with< ut a peer. There are com
paratively few typographical errors
and those few unimportant.
In accordance with this ideal,
special articles are included. I'ro
fessor Newcomer, better perhaps
than any other man on the campus
could do, has a "Literary Retro
spect" looking back in his easy way
to the early days of the undergrad
uate publications. Those most J
fitted to speak have told of Stan
ford enterprises. E. W. Smith,
'99, takes "Encina Hall, its Place
in Stanford Life"; Will H. Irwin,
'99, in his inimitable style tells of
"The Dramatics of Stanford";
Dane Coolidge, '98, writes of
"The Tassing of the Camp"and
what it has meant to struggling
students; Bristow Adams, of
Chaparral fame, in unusually brisk
and humorous vein gives "The
Founding of the ChaparraV and
an account of the old Encina din
ing-room.
Stanford ideals, what it is possi
ble for Stanford to be —these are
set off by Dr. Jordan in "When
Stanford Becomes of Age," to a
Stanford man by far the most val
uable a rticle in the book. Dr. O. j
L.Elliott in retrospect compares
the old campus life when there
were "over-hubblous Encinaites"
to the day when "shortening of;
tether is inevitable."' Dr. Frank
Angell in"The Golden Ageof Stan
ford Athletics" bespeaks the com
ing on of a new attitude in athletics.
The year's athletics are tersely re
viewed by C. W. Thomas, '03; the
year's debating by J. H. Tage, '03.
The customary fraternity and
organization pages are included.
The statistics of Varsity perform
ances are much better developed
than statistics of other activities.
The art work and the literary
pages are especially noteworthy, j
The art editor, B. C. Bubb, lias
through the work put by him into
the Quad made for himself a place
alongside Stanford's best artists.
His title-page, in memorium page,
and page on "Debating" are excel

lent. Bristow Adams, ex-'OO, and
R. K. Culver, '99, haveseveral full
page drawings, Adams' work
throughout heing up to the unusu
ally high standard set by himself
as an undergraduate. J. K.
Bonnell's "Music" and H. R. John
son'# "Lest We Forget" are features
in themselves. Sterrett's work is
even better than that he did on the
1902 Quad. All the art work is
good, though as confessed by the
editor in his foreword the art work
is not made a specialty.
"The Redemption of Slats," the
prize story by 1). M. Reynolds,
'05, has the college color and the
touches of human nature that
mark it as one of the strongest, if
not the strongest,piece of literature
turned out of Stanford this year.
The "josh" department is subor
dinated, but the laugh is not re
stricted and neither faculty nor
students are spared. There are a
dozen illustrated joshes, a "Bogie
Quello El to," a recitation chair
arm reproduced, a prize puzzle, and
the customary quotations and illus
trated "joshes."
The book is dedicated to Charles
Lathrop, Mrs. Stanford's brother,
treasurer of the Hoard of Trustees.
The staff is as follows: Editor-in
chief, Isaac Russell; business man
ager, A. S. Henley; associate edi
tors, Misses Alice Kimball, Irene
Wright, and Margaret Smith, F.
H. Fowler, 0. A. Wilson, W.
Young, A. A. Hampson, B. R.
Cocks, H. C. Brown, W. F. Dunn,
N. Collyer, R. V. Anderson, and B.
C. Bubb.

"The Redemption of Slats," the
prize story by 1). M. Reynolds,
'05, has the college color and the
touches of human nature that
mark it as one of the strongest, if
not the strongest,piece of literature
turned out of Stanford this year.
The "josh" department is subor
dinated, but the laugh is not re
stricted and neither faculty nor
students are spared. There are a
dozen illustrated joshes, a "Bogie
Quello El to," a recitation chair
arm reproduced, a prize puzzle, and
the customary quotations and illus
trated "joshes."
The book is dedicated to Charles
Lathrop, Mrs. Stanford's brother,
treasurer of the Hoard of Trustees.
The staff is as follows: Editor-in
chief, Isaac Russell; business man
ager, A. S. Henley; associate edi
tors, Misses Alice Kimball, Irene
Wright, and Margaret Smith, F.
H. Fowler, 0. A. Wilson, W.
Young, A. A. Hampson, B. R.
Cocks, H. C. Brown, W. F. Dunn,
N. Collyer, R. V. Anderson, and B.
C. Bubb.
