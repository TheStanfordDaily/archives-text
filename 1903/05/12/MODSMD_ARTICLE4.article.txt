# THEODORE ROOSEVELT TALKS.
## President of the United States in a Strong Address Makes a Special Plea for the Preservation of the Forests. 
### 
The train bearing the presiden
tial party arrived in l'alo Alto at
nine o'clock this morning. The
chief executive was met by Presi
dent Jordan and several members
of the faculty, who conducted the
distinguished visitor through the
immense throng of school children
and citizens to Mrs. Stanford's
carriage, in which he rode to the
Assembly Hall. When President
Roosevelt came on the stage accom
panied by Dr. Jordan, the entire
rooting section burst forth with six
voluminous cheers for ''Teddy."
The earnest and hearty smiles
with which the President greeted
this open and familiar welcome
shows his hearty accord with an
enthusiastic and democratic West
ern spirit. Following the cheers
came the Harvard yell.
C. F. Dittmar, president of the
Associated Students, welcomed the
visitor in a neat speech on behalf
of the students.
Dr. Jordan rose to introduce the
President and paid: "Some years
ago —when the strenuous life did not
seem quite the fateful thing it has
since grown to he —when Mr.
•Roosevelt and 1 were boys together,
it became necessary in New York
politics to get a Democrat to do
something —I forget what —and we
expressed some fears as to the out
come; but an old experienced poli
tician said: 'Mr. lioosevelt, you are
still a very young man. When
you are as old as I am in the ser
vice, you will know that there is no
politics in politics.' Mr. Roosevelt
will surely know that there is no
politics in our welcome of the
President today. I now have the
distinguished honor and privilege
of introducing to you the President
of the United States, 1 have the
greater honor and privilege of in
troducing my old friend, Theodore
Roosevelt."
"President Roosevelt said: "My
fellow citizens, and especially you,
my fellow college men, and college
women: I know you will not
grudge it if I say a special word to
these, the men of the Grand Army,
the men who by their deeds have
putin practice that which renders
it unnecessary that they should
preach. lam glad that in passing
through your beautiful Memorial
Court on my way here 1 was stopped
before the tablet in that court upon
which are inscribed the names of
eighty-live sons of Stanford who
went forth in the late war to fight
for their country. lam glad that
among all the buildings on the
campus of my alma mater the one
held in most honor at Harvard is
the hall erected to the memory of
those who fell in the war for the
Union. It will be a bad day for
our country and a worse day for
our colleges if the time ever comes
when college men do not regard
such a summons as coming pecu
liarly to them, when they do not
count it a privilege to volunteer in
the nation's service.

"The last week 1 have thoroughly
enjoyed, indeed 1 do not know how
I could have enjoyed it more fully
if it were not for the fact that 1
had to make so many speeches.
The very surroundings of this Uni
versity, the hills that rise around
it, unite in making it a place of
beauty unique and transcendant in
its kind.
"The plans of this University,
made hy an American architect,
not copying the old ideas and the
! old ways hut choosing rather that
form of architecture native here to
the soil and climate, the old mis
sion style, and adapting it to his
purpose, have been carried out with
a simplicity and beauty—l was go
ing to say good taste, but beauty is
the stronger word —which makes
i this college foundation unique
| among its peers.
i "Your President has kindly intro
duced me as one of his old friends,
but Mr. Jordan is far too modest a
man to tell the whole truth of my
indebtedness to him. He is one of
those to whom I have many times
had to turn, both before and since
becoming President, for advice and
for counsel, and 1 am very glad
that 1 may have this opportunity
of expressing my obligations to
j him for his help. When I speak
to you of the duty of college men
toward scholarship, and especially
iof their duty toward citizenship, I
may cite your President as an
example of what I mean.
"This race, this nation with its
old inheritance, moral,political,and
physical, has in this Western State
come into a new heritage—l do not
I mean new merely in the sense that
we have added additional territory,
as we have many times done, hut a
new heritage in things fundamental
as well. The graduates of this
University are looked to, having
the advantages of all this new
wealth of beauty and opportunity
of the Coast,to do a new work along
new lines in productive scholar
ship. For the great majority of
us, however, it is not given to re
main in the life of study and
scholarly work after brief years in
a place like this; but what we can
all do every where is to fulfill the
duties of good citizenship. Ameri
can in the midst of the great in
dustrial progress of the last fifty
years finds plenty of tendencies for
evil, but it is a cheering sign that
we find them outweighed by the
tendencies for good. It is not given
to many of us, in fact but to a very
few, to produce the masterpieces in
literature, in art, or in science, and
it is well for those to remember
who are engaged in such tasks that
one good piece of work done is
worth a thousand that is fairly
good; and that it is the man who
does the really good piece of work
that confers a lasting benefit upon
his country. Put what is given to
all of us is to be good citizens of the
Republic. The deeds of the fathers
of the Republic and of the men
who preserved tlie Union would
only rise up to shame us if we do
not lead a life of action, a life to
be judged and commended by its
results and by its effect.
"I want to make an appeal to
California for work in preservation
of its great natural advantages.
Let us preserve tbese wonders of
nature because of their surpassing
beauty. 1 would urge economic
ends as well in this endeavor, but
first let me speak of the beauty of
your forests and water courses, and
remember, that there is no utility
greater in the end than the utility
of the preservation of beauty. You
have here in California not merely
the wonderland of our own country
but of the whole world. The forests
of the Coast Range and the forests
that clothe the western slopes of
the Sierras are not only without a
peer but they are without anything
that approaches them in the world.
Yesterday I had the privilege of
looking upon your giant redwoods,
and when I remember that some of
these trees were old when the
Egyptian kings first descended
upon the valley of the Euphrates,
I believe I can call upon you to
agree with me that these majestic
monarchs deserve a better fate
than to be split into shingles.
There is nothing in nature more
practical than the preservation of
beauty, the highest and the finest
utility. And when I remember in
the long run how economic consid
erations are likely to hold sway,
I am glad they too dictate the pre
servation of these trees. The great
inner valleys of your State are de
pendent for their water supply
upon the forests of the mountains.
I am glad that we in America are
about done with our patience of
the individual who would skin a
land, who comes in to a new coun
try to see what he can rob it of in
a few years, and having exploited
it, moves on to a new field. The
men we want to possess the new
regions of our country are men who
enters them as home-makers, who
by their work do not leave their
land desolate, but who increase and
cherish its power and productive
ness.
" I am glad that I can say that
California for years has taken an
interest in forest preservation and
that some of its great forest pre
serves are already safe from the
spoiler. I hope by private means,
or by state or by national action, it
too will be entirely guarded. lam
glad, too, to recall that it was here
in California that a great business
interest showed the good spirit and
forethought to come to the help of
the national government, and that
your redwood men were the first in
the country to set the example of
aiding the Bureau of Forestry, both
by money and friendly cooperation,
in the work of caretaking for the
forests in this part of our land.
The study of forest conditions and
of tree growth was begun on a
large scale among the redwoods of
this State, and hereiwas the pioneer
work in this line. Let us remem
ber, too, that it was the women of
California that firstcameto the res
cue and by their clubs and societies
opened the agitation which is re
sulting so beneficially for the State.
"Every phase of the land policy
of the United States must be di
rected to the upbuilding and en
couragement of the home-maker.;
As the lands of the national do
main pass out of the control of the
national government into individ
ual ownership, we want those lands
to belong to the men who will till
them, and that the men who work
the soil should he its owners.
Whatever abuses may have crept
into the working of the land .laws
of the United States, whereby large
tracts of virtzin land are likely to
drift into the hands of speculators
or a classof large land-owners tend
ing to be created with the idea of
renting or leasing their holdings to
the men who really till the soil,
must be rectified. The lands which
belong to the people collectively
should of right be so administered
that as they pass into individual
ownership they should be held by
the whole body of people living
upon them.
"Most of the present national
domain left vacant for settlement
comes into the province of the Na
tional Irrigation Act. Without it,
the old saying that Uncle Sam is
big enough and rich enough to give
each of his sons a farm, would in no
way be true. The lands that are
left for future expansion are almost
wholly dependent upon irrigation
for their successful cultivation and
settlement. But the policy of the
government remains the same.
Honest, intelligent citizenship can
only come from honest, intelligent
homes, and the home-maker is the
man whom our land laws are in
duty bound to protect and encour
age. Six million acres were pat
ented during the first three months
of this year, and all of the remain
der of the public lands should be
saved for the home-maker.
"The duty lies with especial force
upon the college men of the Coast
to see that our forests he preserved,
that the water supplies for the irri
gation of the fertile valleys be safe
guarded, and that our public lands
should be kept for the use of the
people. You have work ahead of
you in this wide Western region,—
hard work and plenty of it. J
should be sorry if you did not have
to work hard in it. I only envy
you the opportunity which lies be
fore you. And now, seeing the field
which lies before you, labor hard
for yourselves, and for your State,
for our country, and for all man
kind."
