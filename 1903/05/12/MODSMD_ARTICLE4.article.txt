# THEODORE ROOSEVELT TALKS.
## President of the United States in a Strong Address Makes a Special Plea for the Preservation of the Forests. 
### 
The train bearing the presiden
tial party arrived in l'alo Alto at
nine o'clock this morning. The
chief executive was met by Presi
dent Jordan and several members
of the faculty, who conducted the
distinguished visitor through the
immense throng of school children
and citizens to Mrs. Stanford's
carriage, in which he rode to the
Assembly Hall. When President
Roosevelt came on the stage accom
panied by Dr. Jordan, the entire
rooting section burst forth with six
voluminous cheers for ''Teddy."
The earnest and hearty smiles
with which the President greeted
this open and familiar welcome
shows his hearty accord with an
enthusiastic and democratic West
ern spirit. Following the cheers
came the Harvard yell.
C. F. Dittmar, president of the
Associated Students, welcomed the
visitor in a neat speech on behalf
of the students.
Dr. Jordan rose to introduce the
President and paid: "Some years
ago —when the strenuous life did not
seem quite the fateful thing it has
since grown to he —when Mr.
•Roosevelt and 1 were boys together,
it became necessary in New York
politics to get a Democrat to do
something —I forget what —and we
expressed some fears as to the out
come; but an old experienced poli
tician said: 'Mr. lioosevelt, you are
still a very young man. When
you are as old as I am in the ser
vice, you will know that there is no
politics in politics.' Mr. Roosevelt
will surely know that there is no
politics in our welcome of the
President today. I now have the
distinguished honor and privilege
of introducing to you the President
of the United States, 1 have the
greater honor and privilege of in
troducing my old friend, Theodore
Roosevelt."
"President Roosevelt said: "My
fellow citizens, and especially you,
my fellow college men, and college
women: I know you will not
grudge it if I say a special word to
these, the men of the Grand Army,
the men who by their deeds have
putin practice that which renders
it unnecessary that they should
preach. lam glad that in passing
through your beautiful Memorial
Court on my way here 1 was stopped
before the tablet in that court upon
which are inscribed the names of
eighty-live sons of Stanford who
went forth in the late war to fight
for their country. lam glad that
among all the buildings on the
campus of my alma mater the one
held in most honor at Harvard is
the hall erected to the memory of
those who fell in the war for the
Union. It will be a bad day for
our country and a worse day for
our colleges if the time ever comes
when college men do not regard
such a summons as coming pecu
liarly to them, when they do not
count it a privilege to volunteer in
the nation's service.

"The last week 1 have thoroughly
enjoyed, indeed 1 do not know how
I could have enjoyed it more fully
if it were not for the fact that 1
had to make so many speeches.
The very surroundings of this Uni
versity, the hills that rise around
it, unite in making it a place of
beauty unique and transcendant in
its kind.
"The plans of this University,
made hy an American architect,
not copying the old ideas and the
! old ways hut choosing rather that
form of architecture native here to
the soil and climate, the old mis
sion style, and adapting it to his
purpose, have been carried out with
a simplicity and beauty—l was go
ing to say good taste, but beauty is
the stronger word —which makes
i this college foundation unique
| among its peers.
i "Your President has kindly intro
duced me as one of his old friends,
but Mr. Jordan is far too modest a
man to tell the whole truth of my
indebtedness to him. He is one of
those to whom I have many times
had to turn, both before and since
becoming President, for advice and
for counsel, and 1 am very glad
that 1 may have this opportunity
of expressing my obligations to
j him for his help. When I speak
to you of the duty of college men
toward scholarship, and especially
iof their duty toward citizenship, I
may cite your President as an
example of what I mean.
"This race, this nation with its
old inheritance, moral,political,and
physical, has in this Western State
come into a new heritage—l do not
I mean new merely in the sense that
we have added additional territory,
as we have many times done, hut a
new heritage in things fundamental
as well. The graduates of this
University are looked to, having
the advantages of all this new
wealth of beauty and opportunity
of the Coast,to do a new work along
new lines in productive scholar
ship. For the great majority of
us, however, it is not given to re
main in the life of study and
scholarly work after brief years in
a place like this; but what we can
all do every where is to fulfill the
duties of good citizenship. Ameri
can in the midst of the great in
dustrial progress of the last fifty
years finds plenty of tendencies for
evil, but it is a cheering sign that
we find them outweighed by the
tendencies for good. It is not given
to many of us, in fact but to a very
few, to produce the masterpieces in
literature, in art, or in science, and
it is well for those to remember
who are engaged in such tasks that
one good piece of work done is
worth a thousand that is fairly
good; and that it is the man who
does the really good piece of work
that confers a lasting benefit upon
his country. Put what is given to
all of us is to be good citizens of the
Republic. The deeds of the fathers
