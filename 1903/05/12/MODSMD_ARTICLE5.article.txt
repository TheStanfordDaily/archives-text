# DEBATERS ORGANIZE.
## Speakers of Intercollegiate Standing Start University Debating Club Saturday Night. 
### 
A long felt need in debating
circle has now been supplied by the
permanent organization of the
"University Debating Club." To
it are eligible all men in the facul
ty, alumni, and student body
who have been on either theCarnot,
Intercollegiate, or second teams, or
have represented in debate some
university of equal standing with
Stanford.
A number of Stanford speakers
met at the Kappa Sigma house
Saturday night. Besides the mem
bers of the three teams of this jear
there were present Prof. C.A. Duni
way, Prof. R. M. Alden, both old
Harvard debaters, E. W. Rice, '02,
H. C. Jones, '02, A. H. Suzzallo,'99,
and Cecil M. M arrack, '00. A
thorough discussion of debating in
terests at Stanford and the adop
tion of a constitution took up the
greater part of the evening. Offi
cers of the organization were elected
as follows: President, H. C. Jones,
'02, secretary-treasurer, 0. C. Spen
cer, '04.
The objects of the new body are:
first, to maintain a close relation
between and keep in close touch
with the alumni mid undergradu
ate debaters; second, to act as an
intermediate step between the de
baters and faculty; and third, to
guide the policy of debating inter
est at Stanford. Outside of the
great amount of useful work that
the society can do for the further
ance of debating interests, it will be
largely an honorary body, since its
membership is limited to those only
who have obtained considerable
distinction in debating work.
