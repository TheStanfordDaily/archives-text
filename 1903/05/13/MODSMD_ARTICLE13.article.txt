The successful production of the
French play last evening must be
a source of satisfaction to all who
have heen looking forward to this
latest attempt in theatricals by the
students. Like "Antigone" and"The
Knight of the Burning Pestle" the
French play portrayed a stage in
many ways new to those taking
part. As a faithful representation
of the French idea the presentation
last night ranks high. The
efforts of those taking part showed
much hard work. These plays un
der the auspices of the different de
partments and clubs are fitting
testimonials of the versatility of the
dramatic talent in the University,
and more than anything else do
they add distinction and weight to
the respective departments among
the people outside the University.
The cast of "Le Monde ou I'on
S'ennuie" was made up almost en
tirely of students who hitherto had
taken no part in undergraduate
dramatics and is therefore to he
commended the more highly for
their production.
