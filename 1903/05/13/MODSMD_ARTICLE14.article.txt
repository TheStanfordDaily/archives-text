The Quad, as are other Stanford
publications, is striving for a higher
standard. It remains for each edi
tor to make out of the annual a
book more thoroughly representa
tive of Stanford life and more ac
curate as a journal of the things
that have been done in the decade
or year gone by. It is a note

worthy fact that the weaker insti
tutions of learning put forth an
nuals which contain scarcely any
thing except "josheß" and matters
purely personal, while the annuals
of the oldest and strongest institu
tions make year-books that have
not a page of "joshes" in them.
The Stanford annual has each year
approached nearer the higher stan
dard and this year much nearer
than ever before.
The Quad, should represent the
best work that Stanford can do.
It is not fair to Stanford to leave
the fate of the literary department
to a prize contest, as was shown
this year when none of the poems
handed in to the board were con
sidered sufficiently meritorious to
receive the award. In this year's
annual are included some of the
best art work that has appeared in
the Chaparral this year and a
poem from the Sequoia. This Btep
is in the right direction and ulti
mately the prize literary competi
tion should be eliminated entirely,
the Quad using in its pages the
best of the year's undergraduate
work both in prose and poetry.
This idea is not a new one but
never before this year was the
necessity of such a system made
more evident.
