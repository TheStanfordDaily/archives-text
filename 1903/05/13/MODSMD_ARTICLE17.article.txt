hitherto been possible, and appeal
to literary ability in other depart
mental as well as the English.
Prof. J.O. Griffin has offered a prize
of five dollars for the best original
German composition. Short stories
will receive preference over other
forms of composition, manuscripts
of over 2000 words in length not
being desirable. The composition
to which the prize is awarded will
be published in the Sequoia. That
magazine may print any others
submitted. The contest is open to
all registered students, the date of
closing will be announced later.
Prof. M. M. Ramsey offers a
prize of five dollars for the
best original Spanish composition.
The contest is opened to all under
graduate students; as with the
German contest, short stories will
receive preference. The best com
positions will also be printed in the
Sequoia. The exact date of the
contest will be announced next
fall. Prof. M. M. Ramsey will
have charge of the judging.
Jn both cases should no manu
script of sufficient merit be received
the prizes will not be awarded.
These prizes open a new field of
literary activity to those in both
the German and the Spanish de
partments. The Sequoia will also
consider translations which have
merit in themselves, and so en
deavor to recognize a kind of liter
ary work that heretofore has been
verv little appreciated.
F. H. Fowler, '04, assistant edi
tor of the Sequoia, will have charge
of the contests.
