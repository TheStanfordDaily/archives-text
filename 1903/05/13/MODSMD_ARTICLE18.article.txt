# Commencement Sequoia.
## 
### 
The last issue of the Stanford
Sequoia for the current year will
eclipse in size aud merit any prior
production of the volume. It will
he a double number, extensive con
tributions of story and verse being
drawn from Stanford's best literary
talent. R. J. Sterrett, '03, will
contribute a commencement poem,
and among the prose writers Ralph
Renaud, '03, Miss Irene A. Wright,
'04, Delmar Reynolds, '05, and
Hugh Moran, '04, take the impor
tant positions. Moran's story took
second place in the Quad competi
tion and was omitted from the an
nual only because of lack of space.
The magazine will be out next
Tuesday.
