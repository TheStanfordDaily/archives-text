# LAST UNIVERSITY ASSEMBLY.
## An Undergraduate Meeting at Which Upper Class-Men Only Will Speak.â€”Addresses by California Men. 
### 
Friday at 11:15 the last Uni
versity Assembly of the year will
be held in Assembly Hall. The
meeting will differ materially from
its predecessors in that it will be
entirely in the hands of under
graduates. C. F. Dittmar, '03,
president of the Associated Stu
dents has control of the meeting
and has developed plans for a suc
cessful finale. The purpose of
throwing affairs into the hands of
the students is to give those men
who have gained experience in stu
dent body activities a chance to
impart their inside knowledge to
the men who must direct affairs
next year and in years to come.
It has been Dittmar's intention to
make the talks as inclusive as pos-

sible, and with this end in view he
has selected a representative body
of men. They are tied down to no
specific subject but will speak along
the lines they consider most bene
ficial to the undergraduates as a
whole or along lines in which they
have had most experience.
The Stanford men who have been
chosen are Frank Iloehr. '04, Roy
O. Hadley, '03; W. C. Maloy, '03,
J. H. Page, '06, 11. M. Lewis, '04,
W. B. Barnhisel, '03, D. V. Cowden,
'03, J. C. McCaughern, '03, and
Claude Winans, '03. J. K. Bon
nell, '03, was put on the list but is
ill and cannot attend.
The Assembly will include the
usual features and organized root
ing.
