# PRESENTATION OF PLAY
## French Club Reproduce Modern French Comedy With Excellent Success 
### 
Pailleron's comedy, "Le Monde
ou Ton S'ennuie," was a victory
for the cast. The audience was not
as large as it should have been.
Those present, however, saw a very
pretty play, carefully rendered and
beautifully staged.
This played was one of the most
difficult things ever put on the
Stanford stage; there is almost no
action in the piece, its interest de
pending largely on the turn of the
phrases. Add to thiß the foreign
speech in which these subtleties of
speech are put, and the difficulty
was doubled.
Nevertheless the presentation
was of great interest; the satire on
a certain empty sort of fashionable
society was clearly brought out,
and the stage groupings, the ani
mated scenes of the second act espe
cially, were done so well as to de
serve hearty praise. The best act
ing was probably that of Miss De
Luna as Suzzanne. L. G. Levy as
Paul displayed a distinct ability
and realized his part with ease and
grace. Mme. Rouilier as the
duchess also showed excellent tal
ent, as did Misß Kraft as Jeanne,
Miss Mourot as Mme de C6ran,
Miss Abbott as Lucy, W. J. Stack
as Bellac, W. G. Schulte as Saint
R6ault, C. Brown as Roger. There
were some minor characters, such
as the pompous general of P. A.
Martin and the seedy poet, H. P.
Earle, who helped to relieve the
preciosity of the idlers chez Mme
de C6ran, and an important ele
ment of the spectacle were the love
ly and beautifully gowned young
ladies, who completed the chatter
ing group around the "professeur
pour dames," Misses Yoell, Ed
wards, Seadler and Evans; also the
black-coated men who helped fill
out the scene, Turner, Spivalo,
Stanley, and Smith.
Miss Doris Pugh was the dainty
and tres belle handmaiden, and
Rouilier the good looking footman.
The part of Virot was taken by
J. T. Cooper.
Music between acts was played by
the University Orchestra.
The report of the finance com
mittee is not yet ready, owing to
the pressure of other than math
ematical examinations now worry
ing the much-rehearsed students in
charge, but it will be given in an
early issue.
