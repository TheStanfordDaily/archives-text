# TALKS IN ASSEMBLY.
## Dr. Jordan Speaks for Students' Guild.—Addresses by Students and California Men. 
### 
The last Assembly of the year,
this morning at 11:15, was a stu
dent body meeting. After Dr. Jor
dan had presented the work of
the Students' Guild, what it had
been doing during these weeks
when so many away from home and
without friends have been stricken
with the fever,and after he had laid
itsclaims before the students in gen
eral, the hour was turned over to
the students for their own discus
sion of affairs.
Dr. Jordan said: "The Univer
sity itself is a gift to the students—
the place, these buildings, the lib
rary and other means to work, the
teaching of the faculty, all have
been freely given to the students.
The student must supply his own
brains and will to work. He is ex
pected to support himself while
here, and not to lean for support
on the University. lam glad the
students, for the most part, have
always understood this. And now
in regard to the special crisis which
during the last weeks has been
upon us. The University can no
more turn itself into a hospital
than into a soup-house. As indi
viduals here working together, we
should care for each other when
the need comes. There are many
students here who are working
their way along as they go, who
when they are taken sick may not
have friends they can fall back
upon; usually they do not have
any money to tide them over. In
such a case we can either let them
die of neglect, or help them. It is
not the business of the faculty to
care for these, though many indi
viduals in the faculty have done
much to help; it is not the business
of the Founder, who has given all
she has for the educational oppor
tunity here offered you, though she
too has assisted with nurses and
supplies to the amount of over two
thousand dollars. It is peculiarly
a call upon the students. A call
to show their generosity and fellow
feeling. Let each one give until he
feels it, until he is the poorer in
pocket for it, and so the richer in
spirit."
Dr. Jordan then spoke of the
work of the Students' Guild, an or
ganization which through the ten
years of its existence lias always
given aid in cases of emergency
or necessity, and in the great ma
jority of cases to students who were
not members of it."The Guild."
he said "has not been organized on
a scale equal to the demand which
through these weeks has been
thrust upon it. Next year we will
all belong to it. A permanent
hospital will befitted up and means
held in reserve to furnish aid im
mediately in all cases demanding
it. Hut meanwhile the Guild has
been going ahead. It has hired
nurses, established the hospital in
Encina and at the Y. \V. C. A.
Clubhouse in Palo Alto, has call
ed in physicians, and given all
supplies, medicines, and
needed in the thirty cases which it
has taken.
"I am glad that when this j
trouble came to us we had a man
as the president of the Guild who:
is not aicollege grafter —who took
up the task regardless of his own
interest. If a different sort of man
than Frank Hess had been at the
head of the Guild when this trouble
began, there might have been
twenty deaths among the helpless
students. Hess has gone right
ahead regardless of his own gradu
ation, his own studies, or anything
of that sort, has hunted up the stu
dents needing him, organized the
hospitals, and seen that they got
attention."
Frank Hess then showed the
financial standing of the Guild,
and explained the details of its
hospital work.
Dr. Jordan turned over the meet
ing to the Associated Students. W.
B. Barnhisel, '04, was the first man
called upon, and he took as his
subject the athletics of the coming
year. "We have sometimes had
trouble in the past over our
student athletes; 1 think this will
be largely done away with when
we have athletic students. Then
the student will be first and the
athlete secondary, and he will be a
real student like the rest of us. We
have learned a good deal in
the past year about clean, straight
forward, sportsmanlike athletics.
The one improvement for next year
1 can now think of is for every
memberof the student body to take
an interest in athletics. And in
this plea I must cordially include
all members of the faculty; I need
hardly say that I should think of
apologizing if I had to urge any
student to have such an interest.
The next thing before us is the

football season, and it is for the
student body to back Lanagan,
who will probably be our coach.
With that kind of spirit, the spirit
will get into the team; if it will
not make victory certain, it will
make anything else almost impos
sible."
R. 0. Hadley, '03, spoke briefly
and well, on undergraduate duty
to the Student's Guild.
George Sibley, editor of the Uni
versity of California Journal of
Technology,who had been invited to
come from the University of
California, thanked the stu
dents on behalf of his fellow col
legians for this expression of good
will between the institutions. He
spoke, as he had a few days pre
viously to the California students,
on rooting and cheering at in
tercollegiate meets of various kinds,
and plead for a better and more
friendly acquaintance. He closed
with the famous quotation of an
Eastern coach, "Let him now win
who can; but win or lose, we can
not choose but to be gentlemen."
Page spoke . cheerfully of next
year's debating prospects. "With
four Varsity debaters of this year's
teams entering the field, and many
others almost as strong, it will be
our own fault if next year's debat
| ing does not surpass all that has
gone before it. The one thing
needed is more universal and genu
ine interest on the part of the
student body."
W. C. Maloy, '03, spoke of our
relations with the smaller univer
sities of the Coast. He said, "Stan
ford now is full of life and hope,
and it is for us to take the lead
among the institutions of the Coast
in developing an earnest, friendly
spirit of rivalry in athletics, debat
ing and other activities."

Cecil Marrack, '01, president of
the student body during his senior
year, gave the voice of the alumni
to the meeting, to congratulate the
University on the success of the
assemblies started this year, and
their wonderful reinforcement to
college spirit. Incidentally he
praised U. C.'s growing friendli
ness, Dr. Farrand's launching of
the assemblies, the good old-time
policy of "cultivating your major
'prof,' " and the better spirit that
now seems to be dominating Stan
ford.
J. A. Brewer, editor of the Uni
versity of California Magazine, re
ferred to the fact that members of
the faculties of each institution had
often been invited to appear before
audiences of the other, but that
this was the first time a student
from either had had the privilegd.
Brewer spoke of the relations be
tween the universities which would
encourage friendship, of the fun
damental interests they had in
common as a sort of separate col
lege world all to themselves, and
praised the means which would
serve to bring about better mutual
understanding. One practical sug
gestion, which he wished was more
followed, was that visiting between
the students of the two schools
would tend toward breaking up
hostile feeling and give all a
wider and more charitable outlook
and together bring up the west
ern college world.
As the last speaker of the morn
ing, President Dittmar introduced
Frank Roehr, president-elect of the
student body for the coming year.
The clever singing of Charlie
Field's song, ''The Roble Maid,"
by the Girls' Glee Club, Miss Chita
Kraft, '03, taking the solo part,
drew spontaneous applause.

wider and more charitable outlook
and together bring up the west
ern college world.
As the last speaker of the morn
ing, President Dittmar introduced
Frank Roehr, president-elect of the
student body for the coming year.
The clever singing of Charlie
Field's song, ''The Roble Maid,"
by the Girls' Glee Club, Miss Chita
Kraft, '03, taking the solo part,
drew spontaneous applause.
The last Assembly of the year,
this morning at 11:15, was a stu
dent body meeting. After Dr. Jor
dan had presented the work of
the Students' Guild, what it had
been doing during these weeks
when so many away from home and
without friends have been stricken
with the fever,and after he had laid
itsclaims before the students in gen
eral, the hour was turned over to
the students for their own discus
sion of affairs.
Dr. Jordan said: "The Univer
sity itself is a gift to the students—
the place, these buildings, the lib
rary and other means to work, the
teaching of the faculty, all have
been freely given to the students.
The student must supply his own
brains and will to work. He is ex
pected to support himself while
here, and not to lean for support
on the University. lam glad the
students, for the most part, have
always understood this. And now
in regard to the special crisis which
during the last weeks has been
upon us. The University can no
more turn itself into a hospital
than into a soup-house. As indi
viduals here working together, we
should care for each other when
the need comes. There are many
students here who are working
their way along as they go, who
when they are taken sick may not
have friends they can fall back
upon; usually they do not have
any money to tide them over. In
such a case we can either let them
die of neglect, or help them. It is
not the business of the faculty to
care for these, though many indi
viduals in the faculty have done
much to help; it is not the business
of the Founder, who has given all
she has for the educational oppor
tunity here offered you, though she
too has assisted with nurses and
supplies to the amount of over two
thousand dollars. It is peculiarly
a call upon the students. A call
to show their generosity and fellow
feeling. Let each one give until he
feels it, until he is the poorer in
pocket for it, and so the richer in
spirit."
Dr. Jordan then spoke of the
work of the Students' Guild, an or
ganization which through the ten
years of its existence lias always
given aid in cases of emergency
or necessity, and in the great ma
jority of cases to students who were
not members of it."The Guild."
he said "has not been organized on
a scale equal to the demand which
through these weeks has been
thrust upon it. Next year we will
all belong to it. A permanent
hospital will befitted up and means
held in reserve to furnish aid im
mediately in all cases demanding
it. Hut meanwhile the Guild has
been going ahead. It has hired
nurses, established the hospital in
Encina and at the Y. \V. C. A.
Clubhouse in Palo Alto, has call
ed in physicians, and given all
supplies, medicines, and
needed in the thirty cases which it
has taken.
"I am glad that when this j
trouble came to us we had a man
as the president of the Guild who:
is not aicollege grafter —who took
up the task regardless of his own
interest. If a different sort of man
than Frank Hess had been at the
head of the Guild when this trouble
began, there might have been
twenty deaths among the helpless
students. Hess has gone right
ahead regardless of his own gradu
ation, his own studies, or anything
of that sort, has hunted up the stu
dents needing him, organized the
hospitals, and seen that they got
attention."
Frank Hess then showed the
financial standing of the Guild,
and explained the details of its
hospital work.
Dr. Jordan turned over the meet
ing to the Associated Students. W.
B. Barnhisel, '04, was the first man
called upon, and he took as his
subject the athletics of the coming
year. "We have sometimes had
trouble in the past over our
student athletes; 1 think this will
be largely done away with when
we have athletic students. Then
the student will be first and the
athlete secondary, and he will be a
real student like the rest of us. We
have learned a good deal in
the past year about clean, straight
forward, sportsmanlike athletics.
The one improvement for next year
1 can now think of is for every
memberof the student body to take
an interest in athletics. And in
this plea I must cordially include
all members of the faculty; I need
hardly say that I should think of
apologizing if I had to urge any
student to have such an interest.
The next thing before us is the

football season, and it is for the
student body to back Lanagan,
who will probably be our coach.
With that kind of spirit, the spirit
will get into the team; if it will
not make victory certain, it will
make anything else almost impos
sible."
R. 0. Hadley, '03, spoke briefly
and well, on undergraduate duty
to the Student's Guild.
George Sibley, editor of the Uni
versity of California Journal of
Technology,who had been invited to
come from the University of
California, thanked the stu
dents on behalf of his fellow col
legians for this expression of good
will between the institutions. He
spoke, as he had a few days pre
viously to the California students,
on rooting and cheering at in
tercollegiate meets of various kinds,
and plead for a better and more
friendly acquaintance. He closed
with the famous quotation of an
Eastern coach, "Let him now win
who can; but win or lose, we can
not choose but to be gentlemen."
Page spoke . cheerfully of next
year's debating prospects. "With
four Varsity debaters of this year's
teams entering the field, and many
others almost as strong, it will be
our own fault if next year's debat
| ing does not surpass all that has
gone before it. The one thing
needed is more universal and genu
ine interest on the part of the
student body."
W. C. Maloy, '03, spoke of our
relations with the smaller univer
sities of the Coast. He said, "Stan
ford now is full of life and hope,
and it is for us to take the lead
among the institutions of the Coast
in developing an earnest, friendly
spirit of rivalry in athletics, debat
ing and other activities."

Cecil Marrack, '01, president of
the student body during his senior
year, gave the voice of the alumni
to the meeting, to congratulate the
University on the success of the
assemblies started this year, and
their wonderful reinforcement to
college spirit. Incidentally he
praised U. C.'s growing friendli
ness, Dr. Farrand's launching of
the assemblies, the good old-time
policy of "cultivating your major
'prof,' " and the better spirit that
now seems to be dominating Stan
ford.
J. A. Brewer, editor of the Uni
versity of California Magazine, re
ferred to the fact that members of
the faculties of each institution had
often been invited to appear before
audiences of the other, but that
this was the first time a student
from either had had the privilegd.
Brewer spoke of the relations be
tween the universities which would
encourage friendship, of the fun
damental interests they had in
common as a sort of separate col
lege world all to themselves, and
praised the means which would
serve to bring about better mutual
understanding. One practical sug
gestion, which he wished was more
followed, was that visiting between
the students of the two schools
would tend toward breaking up
hostile feeling and give all a
wider and more charitable outlook
and together bring up the west
ern college world.
