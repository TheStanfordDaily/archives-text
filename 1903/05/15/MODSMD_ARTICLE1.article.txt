# TALKS IN ASSEMBLY.
## Dr. Jordan Speaks for Students' Guild.—Addresses by Students and California Men. 
### 
The last Assembly of the year,
this morning at 11:15, was a stu
dent body meeting. After Dr. Jor
dan had presented the work of
the Students' Guild, what it had
been doing during these weeks
when so many away from home and
without friends have been stricken
with the fever,and after he had laid
itsclaims before the students in gen
eral, the hour was turned over to
the students for their own discus
sion of affairs.
Dr. Jordan said: "The Univer
sity itself is a gift to the students—
the place, these buildings, the lib
rary and other means to work, the
teaching of the faculty, all have
been freely given to the students.
The student must supply his own
brains and will to work. He is ex
pected to support himself while
here, and not to lean for support
on the University. lam glad the
students, for the most part, have
always understood this. And now
in regard to the special crisis which
during the last weeks has been
upon us. The University can no
more turn itself into a hospital
than into a soup-house. As indi
viduals here working together, we
should care for each other when
the need comes. There are many
students here who are working
their way along as they go, who
when they are taken sick may not
have friends they can fall back
upon; usually they do not have
any money to tide them over. In
such a case we can either let them
die of neglect, or help them. It is
not the business of the faculty to
care for these, though many indi
viduals in the faculty have done
much to help; it is not the business
of the Founder, who has given all
she has for the educational oppor
tunity here offered you, though she
too has assisted with nurses and
supplies to the amount of over two
thousand dollars. It is peculiarly
a call upon the students. A call
to show their generosity and fellow
feeling. Let each one give until he
feels it, until he is the poorer in
pocket for it, and so the richer in
spirit."
Dr. Jordan then spoke of the
work of the Students' Guild, an or
ganization which through the ten
years of its existence lias always
given aid in cases of emergency
or necessity, and in the great ma
jority of cases to students who were
not members of it."The Guild."
he said "has not been organized on
a scale equal to the demand which
through these weeks has been
thrust upon it. Next year we will
all belong to it. A permanent
hospital will befitted up and means
held in reserve to furnish aid im
mediately in all cases demanding
it. Hut meanwhile the Guild has
been going ahead. It has hired
nurses, established the hospital in
Encina and at the Y. \V. C. A.
Clubhouse in Palo Alto, has call
ed in physicians, and given all
supplies, medicines, and
needed in the thirty cases which it
has taken.
