When approached by those solic
iting subscriptions to the fund for
the Students' Guild, each student
may well keep in mind this fact:
Had the fee been regularly paid by
every student, the Guild's present
financial straits would not be a
phase of the epidemic. It may
well be suggested that every one
pay his back fees. More than
one out of fifteen owes the
Guild for one, two, or more se
mester's cooperation. Most of us
owe fifty cents for every semester
we have been in college. Those who
owe the Guild for past services, —
and the service was just as great
even though the students them
selves had no illness to complain
of, —should pay and count it no sac
rifice. Then in addition let them
dig deep down into their pockets.
"Let each one give until he feels it,
until he is the poorer in pocket
for it, and so the richer in spirit."
