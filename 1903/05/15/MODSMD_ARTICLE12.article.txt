We wish to express our deep ap
preciation of the innumerable kind
nesses shown us by the Masons,
friends, and neighbors during the
illness and burial of our mother,
and we beg to assure them that it
has been and will be a source of
sustaining comfort in our sudden
sorrow. Olga S. Tarbell,
Ruth G. Tarbell,
Geo. E. Tarbell.
