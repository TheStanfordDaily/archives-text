It must be understood that these
statements are subject to revision,
owing to errors in the bills, etc.,
but is as nearly correct as possible
at the time. Frank L. Hess,
President.
From this statement it will be
seen that the Guild at present owes
$1451 and ha√ü on hand $627.37,
which reduces the amount due at
present above available assets to
.$823.85.
According to the estimation of
the Guild officers $2490 will be
necessary to carry the association
through to the end of the epidemic
making a total sum of $3313.85
that will have to be raised.
According to promises and pro
pects the Guild estimates that of
this sum about $1500 may be
counted upon. Among the items
of this list are $250 from the Junior
class, $400 or more from the Senior
class, over $100 from the French
Club.
This leaves to be raised by sub
scription $1,788.85.
The problem which faces the
student body then, is this: A Bum
sum of $1800 must be raised.
Money may be turned over to
any member of the auxiliary com
mittee, with Chaplain Gardner at
the vestry, or with Hans Balkan,
treasurer of the Students' Guild.
The committee will make a man-to
man canvas of the campus and Palo
Alto, and if possible the whole
amount raised before Monday night.
