# 1903 FARCE
## Active Preparations for Presenting One of Stanford's Best Local Productions. 
### 
Now that the farce is one of the
few events left in Commencement
Week, no effort is being- spared to
put it on in the best shape and to
give a performance that will justify
the class in turning over a good
surplus to the epidemic expenses.
The farce in itself is one of the best
ever written by undergraduate
talent. It does not depend for its
fun on a catchy name or unusual
setting: nor does it depend entire
ly on its dialogue. From start to
finish the situations, the action,
furnish the fun and entertainment.
Though in no way an imitation
of "James Wobberts," it most re
sembles this farce in its fun-mak
ing possibilities. With such a
farce to work on, even a mediocre
cast could make a hit. Every ef
fort has been made to gather to
gether the best actors in the stu
dent body. Many changes have
been necessary on account of sick
ness, and by no means has all the
good material been utilized, yet the
cast is one that will do justice to
the farce.
The uncertainty of the last few
weeks has greatly hindered the
work of the Farce Committee, yet
with constant application on the
part of the cast, and with the able
direction of Mr. Paul Gerson of the
San Francisco Dramatic School,
the Senior class will present next
Wednesday evening a worthy farce.
On account of sickness many
changes in the cast have been nec
essary. E. 11. May, '06, will take
a part, that of Willie Grow, '06.
May's work in the English play is
sufiicient guarantee for his acting.
Paul Edwards, '06, will take the
part of the inane chum of the cus
todian of the ax. Doxey Wilson,'o6,
will play the part of Miss Ethel
wynn DeVinney McSnuggins. The
part of Professor Flunkerwell's
wife will be taken by E. V. Henley,
'06, one of the pages in the English
play. Ralph McFadden, '04, will
play Dr. Coffin.
With character parts by Walde
mar Young, May, Wilson, and
Henley, the farce will not lack for
comedy. The plot in itself is very
carefully worked out.
The chorus work and topical
songs will not be the least part of
the show. Harry Lanagan, '04,
and Arch Perrin, '03, have charge
of the music, and the chorus has
been drilling diligently for some
time under their direction.
