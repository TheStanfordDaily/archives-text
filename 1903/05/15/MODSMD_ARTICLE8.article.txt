The University Assembly has
been tried and found successful.
The evolution from the Tuesday
night lecture to the present status
has been carefully planned and
worked out, but the reaction in
unity of spirit, in a better under
standing between the faculty
and students, has reached greater
proportions than was expected of
it. The freshmen and sophomores
cannot realize what the Assembly
has come to mean, for they hardly
knew what it was to be without
it, and the upperclassmen will
not fully realize its worth until
they have been out of college a year
or two and are better able to ana
lyze the influences of the growth of
the Stanford spirit within them
selves.
