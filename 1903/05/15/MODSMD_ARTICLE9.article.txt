There can be no doubt in the
mind of anyone who attended the
Assembly this morning that the
Students' Guild needs money and
that every cent given it will be put
to the very best of use —making
comfortable those who are ill. The
committee which is collecting funds
will endeavor to give every man
and woman on the campus an op
portunity to assist in the work.
It is no small undertaking—this
raising of hundreds of dollars
within a few days time, but wide
spread cooperation is looked for.
There are members of the alumni
acting in San Francisco. But the
whole sum can be raised right here
on the campus. The estimates
handed in by Dr. Snow are conser
vative, and a much larger sum
should be raised. Now is the time
for every Stanford man and woman,
• very Stanford organization, to
back the Guild financially. The

action of the Junior class was a
commendable sacrifice, for every
dollar given by them now must
come again from the members of
the class in assessments next semes
ter.
