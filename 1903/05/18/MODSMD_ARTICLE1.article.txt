# WILL ADD NEW DEPARTMENT
## Building to Be Constructed Devoted to Manufacture of Apparatus for the Sciences. 
### 
There will be established on the
campus next semester a new de
partment of the University to be
devoted entirely to the manufac
ture and repairing of machinery
and apparatus for all the depart
ments. This new branch will be
in charge of two skilled mechani
cians, but Prof. A. A. Browne, now
foreman of the machine shop, will
be the head of the new department.
The present machine shop build
ing is to be extended east one
hundred and ten feet, tilling up the
gap between that shop and the
power-house, and making the com
pleted structure the same length
as the old Civil Engineering build
ing. Construction work will be
gin sometime in the summer.
Plans have already been drawn,
and nothing now remains but the
placing of contracts with the stone
men and the carpenters.
Only one-half of the new addition
is to be turned over to the manu
facture and repair of apparatus, as
the other portion is to be used for
the testing laboratory of the Civil
Engineering department, whose
present quarters will in turn be oc
cupied as a special hydraulic labo
ratory.
The appointment of two expert
mechanicians will probably be
made during the summer. Upon
the completion of the structure the
work of installing the machinery
will be commenced, and for the
work to he done in the department
the finest machines available are
to be installed. The work will call
for the finest watchmaker's lathes,
milling machines, drill presses, and
other machinery.
This new department is to be
established owing to the greatly
increased equipment needed by the
completion of the new laboratories
and scientific buildings. Instead
of buying all the apparatus and
appliances elsewhere, all this equip
ment will be made on the campus.
The plan of having a separate
mechanician department has been
chosen because of the fact that it
will be much more economical than
having a mechanician for each de
partment.
