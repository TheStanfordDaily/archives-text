The Senior Finance Committee
has and will make the two events
over which they have any control
very inexpensive in order to
leave as much as possible in the
treasury. However, the Farce
will in every way be effective and
the presentation will be fully up
to the standard of the annual grad
uating farce. Still it should be re
membered that every cent made
will go to the Students' Guild and
the sale of tickets should be in
creased accordingly.
