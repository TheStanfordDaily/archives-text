# Gym Jinks at California.
## 
### 
One evening about the middle of
each semester, the women of the
University of California hold what
they call Gym Jinks in Hearst
Hall, the women's gymnasium.
The participants are mostly fresh
men, but upper-classmen may also
join in the fun. A few days before,
each girl has been assigned her
particular stunt. All, of course,
appear in their gym suits, and un
der the most agonizing suspense
one after another freshman risks
her life in acrobatic performance in
mid-air. The stunts are followed
by various exciting games, such as
leap-frog and tag. Later in the eve
ning refreshments are served in the
lower part of Hearst Hall and the
affair ends in a general good time.
