# Re-elected General Secretary.
## 
### 
At a recent meeting of the Y. M.
C. A. Advisory Board, Herbert F.
Coolidge, '03, was re-elected gen
eral secretary for next year. The
report of Treasurer Ulrich showed
that tlie Association has a deficit of
$250, most of which amount has
been carried over from previous
years. On account of this debt
Coolidge will donate his services as
general secretary, thereby lessening
the prospective budget by several
hundred dollars. It is confidently
expected that next year will find
the Y. M. C. A. on a sound finan
cial basis.
The members of the advisory
board for next year will be: Prof.
It. M. Alden, president; Instructor
L.E. Bassett, secretary; Dr. Jordan,
Dr. Max Farrand, Prof. A. T. Mur
ray, Dr. O. L. Elliott, George E.
Crothers,'9s, and H. A. Moran,'o4.
