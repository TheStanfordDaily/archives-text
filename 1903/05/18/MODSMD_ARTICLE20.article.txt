# ON COLUMBIA FACULTY
## Many Changes in the Big Law School.â€” Jackson Reynolds, '96, Will Give Courses. 
### 
A large number of changes have
been made in the role of the Co- j
lumbia faculty, the one most
interesting to Stanford people being
the addition to the faculty of Jack
son E. Reynolds, '96, one of Stan
ford's greatest football players.
Reynolds graduated from the Co
lumbia Law School in 1899, and
the following semester took up
work as a faculty member in the
Stanford Law department, where I
he remained for two years. In
1901 he left to do active work in
corporation law practice in New
York. He will give courses in ,
Ageucy, Evidence, Law of Bail-j
ments, and Carriers. He will con
tinue to be a member of the legal
staff of the Central Railroad Com
pany of New Jersey.
The following is from the New
York Evening Post:
"The announcement of the School
of Law of Columbia University for
1903-4, which will be published
before the end of this month, dis
closes a number of radical changes
not only in the administration of
the school, but in the number of
courses offered, the consequent in
crease in the teaching staff, and the
new requirements of admission.
The changes are practically revolu
tionary in character.
"Hereafter the school is to be en
tirely on a post graduate basis of
membership. Graduates of col
leges and scientific schools in good
standing, according to the view of
the authorities, will be admitted
without examination. All persons
other than such graduates must
present satisfactory evidence of

preliminary training obtained in
higher institutions of learning in
this country or abroad equivalent to
that of a full college course. The
rules for the admission of special
students not candidates for the
LL.I3. degree are stringent, such
students, for one thing, not being
permitted to pursue advanced
work unless they are especially
qualified in the law of contracts,
real and personal property, and
equity jurisdiction.
"The courses of instruction
leading to the degree of bachelor of
laws will continue to cover a mini
i mum period of three years, in
which sixty-nine hours of instruc
tion are offered each week, fifteen
hours being open to first-year men,
twenty-five hours for the second
; year students, and twenty-nine for
the seniors. The degree will be
conferred only upon students pass
ing examinations for at least forty
two hours. An additional year of
work leads to the degree of master
of laws.
"In addition to this varied and
elaborate array of courses, the Law
School has cooperated with the
faculty of political science, so that
courses in public law are in many
cases open to candidates for the
LL.B. degree."
