# STORY OF THE FARCE.
## â€œ A Trick for a Trophy," by Young and Renaud, Goes on Wednesday Night. 
### 
The first act opens with a room
in Encina thrown open at a dance.
Willie Grow, a precocious literary
freshman, is discovered reading one
of his new effusions in the Sequoia.
Miss Ethelwynn De Vinney Mc-
Snuggins, Education '04, who is
madly in love with Willie,passes the
door. The freshman to escape her
hides under the couch. Graves, U.C.
'04, the Custodian of the Ax, and
his foppish chum, Brew, who are at
the dance, happen into the room.
In the course of their conversation,
they disclose the whereabouts of the
Ax. Graves and Brew commence
to quarrel over the Ax. Sheridan,
'03, Stanford football captain, Dab
ney, '03, and Miss Sweet, '05, come
in at this time, and Sheridan tries
to relieve the situation. Brew gets
a dance with Miss Sweet, Graves
tries to get a dance with Miss Dab
ney, but as all her dances are taken
with Jack Sheridan, he is disap
pointed. Graves, seeing that he is
not wanted, retires, and Jack and
Alice Dabney engage in a character
istic lovers' quarrel. Just as they
are about to makeup, the freshman
springs with a yell from behind the
couch. He gets a severe shaking
from Jack for his trick. He tells
that he knows where the Ax is.
Jack makes him stay in the room
while he goes off with Alice to find
his chum, Harry Wielands, '03.
June Sweet, the soubrette, enters
and trifles with the poor freshman's
affections. He does his best to im
press her with his keenness, but
she treats him like a smart boy and
finally leaves him to the tender
mercies of Miss McSnuggins. The
poor freshman, driven into a cor
ner, drags Miss McSnuggins off to a
dance. Prof. Horace Flunkerwell
and his wife enter and engage in a
little old fashioned love-making.
Willie and Miss McSnuggins re
turning from their dance surprise
the professor consoling his wife.
The professor manages to wriggle
out of the embarrassing situation.
Just at this moment Jack returns
with Harry to findoutall thefresh
man knows about the Ax. To get
rid of the crowd Harry pretends
madness and the professor and his
companions rush off to find a doc
tor. Jack finally drags out from
the freshman all he knows about
the Ax, and immediately Jack
formulates a plot for its recovery.
Harry and Jack do a war-dance
about the room. Graves and Brew
enter and are much incensed at the
celebration. Graves insults Sheri
dan, but Jack for hospitality's Bake
passes it over. However, when
Graves spenks slightingly of Miss
Dabney, Jack strikes him and it
is only the arrival of the doctor
with a chloroform bottle that saves
Graves from a thrashing. Twelve
o'clock strikes and Professor Flunk
erwell declares that the dance is
over.
The second act takes place at a
smoker at the Kappa Zeta house at
Berkeley. Willie in a moment of
forgetfulness hints that the Stan
ford men know where the Ax is.
The Berkeley men enraged rush

the. freshman up Co-ed Canyon.
Jack and Harry follow to
do what they can for Willie. The
crowd has just gone when Professor
Flunkerwell, who has got an idea
that the Stanford boys came up to
Berkeley to steal silverware, falls
through the skylight. Not a whit
dismayed, he proceeds to look up his
clews. He discovers that his vic
tims, Jack and Harry, have been
there. He hears them coming and
hides. The boys come back to get
the Ax. Just as they are breaking
into the locker where the Ax is hid
den, the professor nabs them.
They ''rough house" him severely,
thinking he is the Berkeley night
watchman. Alice and June come
in to see how the boys are getting
on. They inveigle the professor
into agreeing to let the boys go.
The professor finally tears himself
away from June.
The crowd of Berkeley men, hav
ing given Willie a scare, bring him
back to the house. Willie shams
death. Jack laments over Willie's
dead body. The Berkeley men,
struck with remorse,leave the Stan
ford men with their dead. Then
by a neat trick the Ax is carried
off. The last act shows the quad
and the excitement and prepara
tion for an Ax celebration. Jack,
Harry,and Willie are brought in in
a cart, for the speech making. The
professor arrives in an automobile.
Iu breathless haste he has followed
the theives. He tries to break up
the celebration, but he is rushed off
the stage. Willie, finding himself
and June alone, takes this oppor
tunity to lay his love at her feet.
She tells him that he is much too
young. As June leaves Miss Mc-
Snuggins enters and throws her
self on Willie's neck, rejoicing that
he is safe. Willie calmly informs
her that he was drunk at the
Kappa Zeta smoker. Miss Mc-
Snuggins in scorn casts him aside.
June and the professor enter. June
seeing Mrs. Flunkerwell approach
ing pretends to faint in the pro
fessor's arms. Professor Flunker
well then has a few very uncom
fortable moments with his wife.
Graves and Brew discuss a plan
for rescuing the Ax. They lie in
wait for Sheridan, who soon enters
with Alice. A serious quarrel en
sues. But Jack, forced to choose
between the girl and the Ax, un
hesitatingly casts away the Ax.
Willie enters and finds the Ax. He
is overjoyed and sees visions of
himself as the college idol. But
Graves and Brew surprise him and
take the Ax away. Professor
Flunkerwell enters, and relying on
the dignity of his position demands
the Ax. Willie and the professor
are tied up. Jack comes in, and,
cast down by Alice's treatment, is
going to kill himself. On second
thought he takes a dummy that
has been used to hang the pro
fessor in efiigy and arranges it so
that it looks as though he had
killed himself. Graves and Brew
enter and Graves means to scare
the supposed Sheridan by striking
the Ax into the table near the body.
Alice enters just in time to see
Graves accidently cut the dummy's
head off. Jack seizes the Ax, which
from that daj T forth remains at
Stanford.
