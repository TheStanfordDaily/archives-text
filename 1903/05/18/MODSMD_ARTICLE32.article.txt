# Candidates for Two Teams.
## 
### 
The game between the Faculty
baseball team and the team from
the Senior class has been scheduled
for the morning of next Thursday.
The Seniors have not as yet done
any great amount of practice. To
morrow and Wednesday afternoon
at 4 o'clock all candidates for the
team will meet on the Varsity
diamond for work. A captain will
be elected tomorrow afternoon at
4:30 o'clock. The Senior team
will have a larger number of Var
sity baseball men on it than
usual. Parker will probably play
on the infield, instead of working
in the box. From this year's Var
sity infield will be Cowden and
Copp. Cowden will probably be
behind the bat. Hrown,this year's
center fielder, and Lowenthal, left
fielder, will be in the game. Ben
nett, who was on the 1901 team
and who is a good pitcher, is
eligible and may play.
The remaining places will be
cared for by men who have been
playing on the second teams, a
number of whom are members of
'03.
The Faculty team will probably
have as battery Professors Newsom
and Kellogg. Most of this season
Professor Searles has been playing
on first base, Dr. Angell and Pro
fessor Adams at second, Professor
Fish at short, and Instructor Allen
at third. Professor Marx and Pro
fessor Murray have been playing
outfield positions. The full per
sonnel of the team has not yet been
fully determined upon. Dr. Angell,
who has been ill with typhoid, will
probably not be able to play his
old position at second.
