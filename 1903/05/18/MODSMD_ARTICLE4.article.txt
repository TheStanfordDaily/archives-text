# DEATH FROM TYPHOID.
## Howard Clarence Hubbard, '03, After a Month's Illness Dies in Los Angeles. 
### 
This morning a telegram was re
ceived at the Zeta Psi house which
told of the death of Howard Cla
rence Hubbard, '03, at 11:50 o'clock
last night, at his home in Los An
geles.
The news was hardly expected
though it has been known on the
campus for several days that Hub
bard was very seriously ill. He
was taken sick five weeks ago at
the Zeta Psi house and was moved
immediately to his home in Lob
Angeles.
He was a graduate of the Los
Angeles high school with the class
of 1898, and entered Stanford as a
special student in the History de
partment in September of 1899. In
college Hubbard was a prominent
fraternity man and prominent in
musical affairs, belonging to Zeta
Psi and Sigma Sigma and to the
Mandolin Club. He has not been
registered in the University on ac
count of ill health for several
months, but has spent his time
with his fraternity brothers at the
Zeta Psi house.
Hubbard is to be recognized
preeminently as a liberal hearted
and generous college man, one
whom many knew and liked,
and whose judgment was respected.
In college he had a host of friends,
many more than comes to the
average student.
His father, Mr. A. A. Hubbard,
was a retired business man of Los
Angeles. Horace Clarence Hubbard
was a brother of R. B. Hubbard,
'98, also a member of Zeta Psi.
The funeral will be held in Los
Angeles tomorrow.
