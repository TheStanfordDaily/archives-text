# FUNDS FOR GUILD.
## Sum Amounting to $1100 Already Subscribed.â€”$900 Still to be Raised. 
### 
At a meeting of- the auxiliary
committee held last evening the
new subscriptions reported from
students amounted to $375.75, and
from members of the faculty, $426.
Besides these amounts Dr. Gilbert
reports a gift of $200 from the Book
store funds and $100 from
Timothy Hopkins, a total of over
$1100. Many subscriptions tire
yet to come in from the faculty,and
some of the students have not yet
been canvassed. It was determined
to push the canvass vigorously in
an endeavor to raise the remaining
$900 required before college closes.
Subscriptions will be received by
the officers of the Guild, members
of the auxiliary committee, Chap
lain Gardner at the veslry, and at
the oHice of the Daily Palo Alto.
