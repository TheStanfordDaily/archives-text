# Will Test Deeds.
## 
### 
To test the validity of the clause
in the original deeds of Palo Alto
property forbidding the sale of
liquor under penalty of reversion
of the land to the original owner,
Timothy Hopkins has commenced
suit against Peter Mullen asking
that the land on which Farmin &
Blade's billiard hall is located be
returned to him. Hopkins alleges
that Mullen connived at the sale of
liquors by his tennants.
