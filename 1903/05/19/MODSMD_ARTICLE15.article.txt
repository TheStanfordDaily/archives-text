The entire sum needed for carry
ing the Students' Guild through
the epidemic has not yet Keen
raised. Though thesum reported by
the auxiliary committee last night
was greater th in expected, there re
mains still a few hundred dollars
to be raised. The response of the
student body and of the faculty has
been with the hest of spirit, though
the time of year is one when stu
dents feel the greatest strain finan
cially. Many have not yet been
given an opportunity to contribute.
In case the auxiliary committee
cannot he reached, money may he
sent by mail to Chaplain Gardner
or to Hans liarkan, treasurer of the
Guild.
