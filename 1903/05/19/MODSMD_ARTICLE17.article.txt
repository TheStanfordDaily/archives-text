# The
						Commencement "Chaparral."
## 
### 
The Chaparral appears with a
large double number tomorrow.
All material is fully up to the
standard of former Commencement
numbers, both art work and fun
features. One of the features
,of the issue is a drawing of "My
I Senior Girl," which is one of the
1 prettiest pictures of a girl that has
ever appeared in any Stanford pub
lication. Other art work includes
a notable drawing by R. J. Sterrett,
which gives a new idea of the grad
uate's departure from college; some
clever sketches by Miss Theodora
Holly and Miss Lathrop, and work
1 bp the editor. There is considerable
verse in the issue appropriate to
the time. The front-page poem,
"Departure," is quieter in tone
than most Chaparral verse, but
others, "A Lagunita Tale," and a
choice hymn of "Requested Gradu
ation" more than make up for this
possible lack. There is also a
plentiful supply of the usual
"joshes," both prose and verse.
"A Sample Rage from u Chappie's"
Account Book" and one or two
editorials may cause comment.
