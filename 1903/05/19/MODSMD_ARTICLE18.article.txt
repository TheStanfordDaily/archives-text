# A 						Special Number of "Alumnus."
## 
### 
The Stanford Alumnus, a special
Commencement number devoted to
the Class of 1903, will go on sale on
the quad tomorrow morning, price
15 cents.
Cuts of the graduates are in
cluded, a short history of the class,
and spicy write-ups of its promi
nent members. The number will
appeal more strongly to the under
graduates than any number ever
gotten out by the publication.
