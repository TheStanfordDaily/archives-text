Chaplain Gardner's subject Sun
day afternoon was "Divine Provi
dence," that foresight and care
which God exercises over the world
of nature and His creatures. "The
idea of Providence is confirmed by
science, seen in the record of human
history, and proved by personal ex
perience." To clinch the first ar
gument, the chaplain appealed to
the great scientists and philoso
phers of the 19th century, conclud
ing with Herbert Spencer's declara
tion, "The exsitence of an eternal
power back of all phenomena is the
one certain element of our knowl
edge."
Then he reviewed the testimony
of history, taking for special exam
ples the Jewish and Anglo-Saxon
nations. And dealing with Eng
land, he recalled Kipling's "Reces
sional," a stirring appeal to Eng
land's consciousness of God amid
the intoxication of its great Jubi
lee, —"lest we forget, lest we forget."
And lastly, the speaker appealed
to personal experience, quoting his
own, and appealing to that of his
hearers. He admitted the mystery
of pain and sorrow, and suffering
and death, but said he believed
that in God's good time we should
understand, and that some day,

when we look back with our spirit
ual eyes opened, we should see
through the woven pattern of our
life the golden cord of the provi
dence of Uod.
