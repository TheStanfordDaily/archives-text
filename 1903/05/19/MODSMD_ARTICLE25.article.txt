Laundry work can be done in short
order at reasonable prices.
Those who wish to outfit for the trip
to the high Sierras will find a complete
line of supplies at the Yosemite store.
HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS.
The Sentinel is the only hotel in the
valley. It affords excellent accommo
dations, and notwithstanding the fact
that all supplies have to be brought in
by team, the table lacks none of the
delicacies to which you are accustomed.
The rates are reasonable, ranging from
$3.00 to $4.00 per day.
For those who prefer the freedom and
novelty of camp life there are two ideal
camps—Camp Curry and Camp Yosem
ite.
Camp Curry.
Camp Curry is located one mile up
the valley from the Sentinel Hotel.
It is situated just below Glacier Point,
which towers above the camp—an al
most perpendicular wall 3250 feet. It is
but twenty rods from the site of the old
Stoneman House—a choice spot for loca
tion of camp or hotel. The soil is sandy

and carpeted with a heavy layer of pine
needles. The coldest of pure spring
water from the foot of Glacier Point is
piped through the camp. Camp Curry
is an ideal hotel camp. It affords the
freedom of camp life with all the con
veniences and comforts of a hotel.
Equipment.
The tents are of various sizes and are
comfortably furnished for the accommo
dation of one or more persons; part have
board fioors and all are carpeted. The
beds are fitted with spring mattresses,
wool top mattresses and the necessary
coverings. The tables are provided with
wholesome foods, well cooked and
temptingly served.
Hates.
The rates at these camps are $2.00 per
pay, $12.00 per week, or $45.00 per
month. Children under 10 years, $1.00
per day.
810 TREES.
THERE ARE NO BIG TREES IN
YOSEMITE. The Tuolumne and Mer
ced groups are the nearest to the valley.
On no other line than those traversed
by the Merced-Santa Fe stages are the

big trees reached without the necessity
of making a side-ride and atop-over to
view these giants of a former age.
The Tuolumne Big Trees.
The Tuolumne group contains the fam
ous "Dead Giant," better known under
I the name of "King of the Big Trees,"
I (forty feet feet in diameter) through
which a tunnel has been cut for the pas
! sage of the stage road. The road winds
j through the grove and ample time is
| given for viewing the trees.
The Merced Big Trees.
This well-known group is passed
j through on the return trip, contains
| some of the most perfect specimens of
I the "Sequoia" in existence. One should
get out of the stage and walk around
! one of these giants to be able to appre
| ciate their immense girth.
To the High Sierras.
Yosemite is the outfitting point for
| parties whodesire to visit the High Sier
i ras. This trip cannot be made until
about July Ist on account of the snow
covering the higher trails. The trail
| leads by Lake Tenava on the old Tioga
I road to the Tuolumne Meadows, where

the bubbling soda springs are situated.
From here it is an easy day's trip to the
summit of Mount Conness (12,500 feet
high), Mount Dana (13,000 feet), or
Mount Lyell (13,05)0 feet). The snow
clad peaks, tlie deep blue glacier lakes
and the peculiar peaks and domes of
these mountains make the trip full of
novelty and interest. The trout fishing
is immense.
Special rates are made to parties
making this trip for outfit consist
ing of the necessary saddle horses, pack
animals and guides. Provisions and
blankets are supplied at the Yosemite
store. If you are interested in this trip
write us and we will give you further
information as the arrangements have
to be made in advance.
Special Stage Parties.
The stages of the Merced-Santa Fe
Route are of the latest and most com
fortable type. A unique feature of the
service is that parties in stage loads of
live or more are given special service, if
desired, in the new mountain carriages
which have been built to order for this
business. Arrangements for special
stages must be made in advance.

No more hand baggage than neces
sary should be carried.
