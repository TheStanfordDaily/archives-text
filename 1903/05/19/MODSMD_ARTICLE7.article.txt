Before the members of the stu
dent body scatter I desire to give,
generally, the "good bye" which,
in many instances, I may not have
the opportunity of saying person
ally. And with this 1 want that
there should go the assurance of
my grateful appreciation of the
cordial welcome given to me in
coming here, of the friendly feeling
which has been so widely shown
toward me in my brief sojourn,
and of the regret so generally and
so earnestly expressed to me over
my leaving.
The memory of all this will be
carried away as my happiest souve
nir of Stanford, to be cherished in
the days to come. Should the steps
of any lead them eastward, it will
hea pleasure to me to renew these
cordial friendships, and I will
always be glad to hear from any
who may remember me, and to be
of any use to those whom it may be
within my power to serve.
My address during the summer
will l>e East Hampton, Long Is
land, New York, and any letters
sent to my former address, 781
Madison avenue, New York City,
will be forwarded.
