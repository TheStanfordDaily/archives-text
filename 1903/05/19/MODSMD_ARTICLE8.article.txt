# "A TRICK FOR A TROPHY."
## The
						Farce of the Graduating Class Will be of High Standard.—Has Good Actors and Chorus. 
### 
"A Trick for a Trophy" goes on
Asßemblyllall stage tomorrow night
at 8 o'clock. The preliminary
rehearsal and chorus work indicate
a presentation of unusually high
standard.
The whole farce was written by
Renaud and Young with the inten
tion of entertaining, and the parts
have been changed to conform with
the style and special aptitude of
each actor. The songs and josh
work are filled with local color but
are equally suited to an ordinary
play-going audience.
The stage setting is going to be
the most pretentious ever attempt
ed on the Stanford stage in class
farces. The first act represents
Willie Crow's room in Encina
thrown open for a dance. A typi
cal Encina room with its fish-nets,
photographs, posters, settees, drop
lights, screens, will be represented.
Never on a college stage has an
Encina room been adequately
represented and the Seniors will
endeavor to reach the ideal.
The second act describes a smok
ing-room in the Kappa Zeta house
at Berkeley. California pillows,
pennants, ami banners have been
especially imported for the occasion,
and as far as possible the setting
will be bent to its original.
The third act is the quad. The
010 setting was inadvertently de
stroyed and a new one has been
painted by Rosa of the Columbia
Theater studio. It will be new
and up-to-date and the best piece of
scenery work Stanford has. The
cobblestones and the bronzes in the
Memorial Court will be truly por
trayed. For the first time a trap
door effect will be used and Prof.
FlunkerweH's entrance will be
spectacular to a degree.
