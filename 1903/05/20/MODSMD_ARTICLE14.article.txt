With this number the Daily
Palo Ai.to gets out its last regular
issue tliis year. Throughout the
semester there has heen a constant
striving on the part of every mem
ber of the staff to make the paper
more representative ot Stanford
and more useful to the student
body. In return has come a more
thorough knowledge of student
body affairs and a considerable
training in college journalism and
preparation for the profession of
journalism. For two years past
each editor has endeavored to raise
the standard of his staff. A man
has been raised according to his
efficiency and value to the paper,
and promotions have almost with
out exception been made with the
approbation of the members of the
staff and in order of succession.
There have worked on the paper,
this year many whose names have
not appeared on the editorial
board. Next year the number of
associates and assistants will be
limited and considerable competi
tion will necessarily result. When
there are more men doing the news
rustling greater care can be taken
with the editorial work. The edi
tor takes this means of thanking,
for himself and for the student
body, everyone who has aided the
paper this semester. The staff
itself knows that the paper will be
in good hands next fall. Wilson
has served a long period, knows
the needs of the paper, and
is thorough and capable. With
proper backing from the student
body the Daily Palo Alto can be
made the best college daily in the
United States. It has in the past
held a high position,—much higher
