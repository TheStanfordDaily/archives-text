# Commencement " Alumnus."
## 
### 
The last issue for the year of the
Stanford Alumnus appeared today.
A great deal of space is devoted to
chronicling the good points of the
Senior ciass and the personal
achievements of the individual
members. A rather incomplete
set of pictures of the graduating
class is printed. Among the
special articles is one on the visit
of President Roosevelt. The cus
tomary resume of University events,
several pages of alumni notes, of
interest to hoth undergraduates and
alumni, follow. The editorials are
unusually thoughtful, the stand
taken in regard to the typhoid
epidemic being at once firm and
judicious.
