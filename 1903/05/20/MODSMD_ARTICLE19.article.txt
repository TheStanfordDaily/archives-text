You are leaving "dear old Stan
ford": the quad — whose very stones
you love —the campus, the arbor
etum, and the lake will soon he
far away. You will miss thetu
sadly in the years to come. But
there is a talisman you can al
ways keep within reach ; it will
bring before you vividly those
scenes among which you lived four
happy years: Take Visit to
Stanford University" with you, and
as you turn the leaves—huff, like
the sandstone —and read the
familiar names and see the fa
miliar places, you will be cheered
and comforted by the little book.
