# FACULTY VS. SENIORS.
## Annual Baseball Game Tomorrow. Proceeds for Benefit of the Guild. 
### 
Following a time honored cus
tom the Faculty and Seniors will
play baseball on the campus dia
mond, and the teams will cross
bats at 10 o'clock. The Seniors
have an unusually strong nine for
a graduating class, six of the play
ers having won Varsity sweaters in
baseball. Among the number are
Cowden and Brown, both ex-cap
tains. The Faculty on the other
hand, will not turn out so strong a
nine as usual. Several of the men
who have been playing with the
Faculty nine throughout the sea
son have left the campus. Professor
Blair, the regular catcher, who is
absent, will give place to Professor
Searles; Professor Fish will till Pro
fessor Kellogg's vacancy in the
pitcher's box; Dr. Angell will play
at third instead of Instructor Cook;
and Instructor Foster in right field
instead of Instructor Allin. In
spite of the fact that there are
many changes in the Faculty line
up a fairly strong team will be put
in the field. Dr. Jordan will play
his accustomed position at first.
An admission fee of twenty-five
cents is to be charged and the en
tire proceeds of the game will be
given to the Students' Guild. The
Seniors maintain great secrecy in
regard to the suits they will wear.
In all probability the Class of 1903
will return to the traditional cus
tom, omitted by the Seniors last
year owing to the fact that the
costumes did not arrive in time for
the game. The game will be called
at 10 sharp. The line-up follows:
