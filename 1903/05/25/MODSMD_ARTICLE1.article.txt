# CLASS-DAY AND LAYING OF PLATE.
## 
### 
Exercises Held in the Chapel and in Arcade of the
Quad. —Graduates Are Urged to Live Up to the
Things Taught Them at Stanford.

With much of Senior Week
dropped, the graduates of 1903, even
more than the graduates of other
years, appreciated the exercises of
Class Day, — the address of the
class president, the history and the
will, and the laying of the class
plate in the arcade, the addresses
of the class orator and Dr. Jordan,
and above all, perhaps, the singing
of "Hail, Stanford, Hail."
At 10 o'clock there gathered in
the chapel the seniors and their
friends.
The Opening: Address.
President L. G. Moore opened
the morning exercises. "Now," he
said, "that we have reached our

Commence
ment Week we
have sustained
a disappoint
ment. Our
plans were not
elaborate, but
such as they
were they have
been greatly
undermined.
But to our

modified Senior Week I wish, in be
half of the class, to extend a hearty
welcome to all who wish to spend
the week with us. Under the cir
cumstances we can not expect to
he too joyous, but there are things
we can do. Our lack of festivities
on the campus will give us all an
opportunity to visit once more the
places which have afforded us
much pleasure during the past four
years. Although many of us may
never again see our quad, it will

never cease
to be dear, and
I should con
aider him
most ungrate
ful who will
leave it with
out a little
feeling of re
gret. "Step by
step we have
been taught by

other classes to look atthingsin
a broader and more generous light.
We are grateful to them for the
lesson, and now that we must
leave them we wish each one of
them as much success as is com
patible with broad-minded rivalry.
"We fully realize how much we
are indebted to our professors and
instructors, and above all we
are exceedingly grateful to the
woman who has offered us
u 11 bou 11 d ed

opportunit ie b
for ma k i n g
ourselves use
ful. And it
is only the
more shame
to us if we
fail to mak*
good use of
what has come
to us."

History of Naught-Three.

"The History of Naught-Three"
was read by the class historian,

T. E. Stephen
son. Partly it
is as follows:
Let all who
in May of 1903
celebrate their
commencement
be glad in their
hearts that
their affiliation
has been with
the class that

was born on the Stanford campus,
four hundred and one strong, in Sep
tember of the year 1899.
The class came to Stanford when
the need of athletes was felt. Dur
ing her career thirty-six of her men
have worn the big white "S." The
Varsity of 1899 had on it four men
from the freshman class, — Raitt,
Lee, Smith and Traeger. That
same year the football heroes of '03
won for Stanford a victory from
the State University freshmen;
the ecore was 6 to 0. In the
spring of that year the University

of Nevada
track team
went down to
defeat. In
1900 Wagner,
Mori and De-
Witt won for
'03 the fresh
in a n - so p h o
more debate.
In 1901 the
debate was
lost.

As a measure of what the class
has amounted to in athletics, let
championships be taken into con
sideration. When sophomores, the
football championship went to '03.
In 1901 and 1902 the series were
not played to an end, but both
years it was conceded that the
wearers of the '03 jerseys were the
strongest on the field. As freshmen,
'03 had two Varsity baseball play
ers. The next year she won the
class championship, and that
season had four men on the
Varsity. In 1902 and 1903 the
class honors again went to '03, and
each year there were six of her
men on the big team. The faculty
senior game is of recent date. The
score was 50 to 11.
On the track more than in any
other sport has '03 shown the
athletic spirit. She has worked
hard, and each year grown stronger.
This year the class championship
went to her, and seven of the seven
teen who were point-winners in the
big victory were men of '03. For
four years there have been '03
players on the intercollegiate team,
and two out of the three women
who won the tennis match from
the women across the bay will
graduate in May of 1903.
Men and women from the class
have been at the heads of the
publications and have worked on

the boards. Every student activity
has been the stronger for its affilia
tions with '03. But the Class of '03
needs not to crow, though it has
won the winner's right to crow. It
stands for itself.
The last days on the campus
have been sad days, sad that old
ties must be broken, sad that there
are some who were with the class
but who now are not. Death is sad
at any time, but sadder yet when
it comes to those who are prepared
to be of great usefulness in the
world.
Naught-Three came to Stanford
when Memorial Arch was half
done and the plumbers were

still busy in
the Library.
She has seen
the ground
broken for
many build
ing s, has
watched the
walls grow
high, the red
tiles added
one by one.

She helped in the ceremonies at the
laying of the cornerstone of Memo
rial Church and her voice was
raised in thanksgiving at its dedi
cation. She fought for the amend
ment, rejoiced when the Stanford
men in the Philippines had
returned. She has seen athletic
teams go down in defeat, and has
danced the serpentine on Market
Street and round the Berkeley
oval. She has seen Stanford fight
her way through trials and times
of great strain. In it all as an
undergraduate body '03 has taken
her part. She has been for Stan
ford first, last, and all the time.
As members of the student body
'03 can do no more. Great draughts
of the Stanford spirit have been
taken in, and the members go forth
the bigger and broader for the air
they have breathed on the Stanford
campus, for the air that blows
through the palm trees of the
quadrangle, that passes down its
arcades and over its poppy fields
and hills. They have learned the
Stanford yell. They have stood
for Stanford things and Stanford
tradition. For what they have
taken out of Stanford they have
already in a very small measure
given return. Greater return will
they give in the future. On the
snow-capped Whitney, in the mines
of Mexico, in the Philippines, in the
cities of the earth, there will the
Stanford yell be given, there will
the Stanford spirit be, there will be
taught Stanford ideas and Stanford
ideals.
The Will of 1903.
Thoreau Cronyn read the last
will and testament of the Class of

1903, cleverly
written and
full of local
hits, "joshes,"
and sound ad
vice clothed
in humorous
form. Among
the pertinent
paragraphs
were the fol
lowing:

To the University, we humbly
and respectful ly offer the suggestion
that the $10 registration fee he
charged either all or none, in order
that the Register may not continue
to belie the University's proud
reputation as a cosmopolitan insti
tution and it may show that stu
dents come from all the earth's
four corners and return to carry
thence the Stanford spirit.
To the Delta Gammas, congratu
lations—too manifold to be ex
tended singly.
To the I'ress, the private infor
mation that it is not true that Dr.
Jordan will resign to enter profes
sional baseball. The rumor was
started by Dr. Angell in a fit of
pique because the President made
twenty more errors than he.
To the athletes of posterity, we
leave the fair name of John Casey
McCaughern, the nearest approach
to an ideal track captain Stanford
wants or can have.
To all future Quad and Chap
arral editors, perpetrators of
farces and josh posters, one emac-

i a ted, over
worked joke
pertaining to
Hodges' dog.
To the "En
cina G a 11 g,"
the "(J k i a h
Pub h," the
"Frat Bunch,"
the Palo Alto
" Innocents , "
the San Jose

" Wire Benders," and the rural
population of College Terrace, we
leave the itimation that "all togeth
er, lustily," is a pretty good Stan
ford creed, and that it's up to every
one to get busy learning it.
To Naught-Five, the custom of
wearing the Junior Plug, hallowed
by the battering of our betters from
Carolus Ager down to Larrey Bow
man, and, although despoiled by
the prudery of your immediate pre
decessors, good enough to be revived.
To Julius A. Quelle, we do give
and devise the business manager
ship of the Daily Palo Alto, free
from Butt-in-skis and job-hunting

athletes, to
have and to
hold until the
staff sees fit, to
request his ab
dication.
As worthy of
emulation by
future Stan
ford vv om en
we bequeath
the memory

of Sue Bird, Mary Hodge, Kath
ryn Kip, Chita Kraft, Eliza
beth Peckham, and Theresa Wil
bur, whom we believe to represent
the quintessence of co-edliness.
To Mrs. Stanford, we leave an
unpayable debt, fervently hoping
that she may be measurably recom
pensed in terms of useful service.
Laying of the Plate.
Immediately after the exercises
in the chapel the '03 plate was
added to the line of eight in front
of Memorial Church. The cere
monies were in charge of President
Moore, who introduced first Claude
Winans, class orator, who said:


H. P. Kuhn
Vice-President


L. G. Moore

Miss Chita Kraft
Secretary


T. E. Stbphknson
Historian


Geo. A. Scoville
Treasurer


Thoreac Cronyn
Writer of the Will

Athletic Manager
Oration by Claude Winans.
Today marks the beginning of
a useful life. We are about to
leave the many scenes which have
become endeared to us here at
Stanford. As we leave this Univer
sity we fully realize that the success
which we may achieve in the future
will be largely due to the influences
which have surrounded us here.
To those who have been instru
mental in providing those influences
we feel most deeply grateful. So
far as words can we would express
I our love and honor to the Founders
who have reared this temple of
learning for the youth not only of
our own land but of every land. It
is only by consecrating our lives to
noble purposes that we can in part
make return for what has been so
; freely given us. We would express
our gratitude and deep appreciation
to Dr. Jordan and our professors,
you who have walked among us as
our leaders —guiding us with uner
ring hand.
Classmates, as the time for
our separation approaches, the
friendships we have formed here
grow stronger. To our Alma Mater
and the cause to which she is
dedicated let us pledge our lasting
affection and our faithful devotion.
In a few days we part. Naught-
Three adds another company to the
ever-increasing army of men and
women who must meet and over
come the difficulties which arise in
our democratic life. It has become
I the custom for.each commencement
week to lengthen this chain of
numerals. Each succeeding class
has forged its link with the same
reverence for the Founders, the same
respect for our President and our
professors, the same love for our
Alma Mater.
It was a source of pleasure to
all of us to see on the morning of
the dedication of this Memorial
Church the plate of the Pioneer
Class. To the outside world it
seemed but a midnight escapade,
but to the Class of '95 that plate,
hallowed by associations which
| become more and more sacred each
; year, had a deeper meaning.
The immediate occasion for our
j assembling here is the dedication
Jof the '03 plate. The words which
have been uttered this morning are
I but the chronicling of achievements
] already dim in the minds of many;
our names and faces will soon be
forgotten. We would leave here
something which will remain after
we are no longer remembered,
something which will last as long
as these arcades endure. May this
latest link take its place in the
chain on the one hand binding us
closely to the Stanford alumni and
on the other ready to welcome
those who will soon follow. This
plate will serve to remind you who
remain of our stay here and to
recall to our minds a host of
pleasant memories.
Address by Dr. Jordan.
Dr. Jordan spoke, saying: I
have two things I want to say:
First, 1 want to point out that it is
a remarkable fact that this plate
has lain in the open air unguarded
; for three days and has not been
molested, something which would
have been impossible in almost any
of the Eastern institutions. There
are many things of this kind which
show that here at Stanford there is
a respect for things that belong to
other people and respect for earnest
purpose.
Secondly, this plate represents
about the same proportion among
its fellows in the quadrangle as you
men and women are to bear to your
fellows. Of a little more durable
stuff each year are these plates
made, just as you college men and
women are being shaped out of more
durable stuff. More and more
Stanford graduates are becoming a
picked class, better fitted to bear
the wear and tear of life. And we
don't want so very many of you
here. We want to select those who
excel in moral character and energy
and brains.
Around this quadrangle is room
for a thousand plates and room
altogether, five lines around, for
five thousand. Imagine a thousand
years backward when there was hut
one university, and backward five
thousand years is beyond the ken
of history.
On the other hand let us go for
ward a thousand years and note
the changes that the era will bring.
On this campus will be an excep
tional training for exceptional men
and women. Already Stanford
produces men and women of a
distinctive type, and long before the
end of the thousand years is
reached the world will be definitely
moved and influenced by the
hundreds who will leave this
institution.
Mrs. Stanford listened to the two
addresses but when asked if she
cared to talk allowed Dr. Jordan to
answer for her, "All Mrs. Stanford
might say to you if she should
speak, you know already."
Following came the song which
has been sung more this year than
ever before, which has been sung
by the members of '03 for four years
past, "Hail, Stanford, Hail." After
the last refrain had died away in
the arcades, the plate was sunk in
its resting place and there left
beside its fellows, a memento of the
Class of 1903.
