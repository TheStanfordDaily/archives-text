The Faculty-Senior baseball game
was an overwhelming victory for
the undergraduate players. For
nine innings the team with six
Varsity players and two ex-cap
tains in its ranks scored at will
against the Faculty nine, from which
six regular players were absent.
As an exhibition of baseball the
game was a farce and the cold wind
which swept across the diamond
did much to keep down the attend
ance. The faculty tried professors
Newsotn, Fish, and Searles in the
box, but their opponents made
thirty-five safe hits, scoring twenty
runs in the eighth. Parker and
Lowenthal pitched for the Varsity
and held the Faculty down to eight
safeties. Of the twenty-nine errors
which were tallied againßt the
players, twenty were the result of
misplays by the Faculty, while nine
were given to the Seniors. Dr.
Jordan occupied his customary
place at first base and proved strong
in the field and at the bat. The
entire proceeds of the game were
devoted to the needs of the Student
Guild. The score by innings fol
