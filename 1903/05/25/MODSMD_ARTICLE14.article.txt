# Reception at Xazmin House.
## 
### 
Friday afternoo'n the parlors of
Xazmin house were filled with
graduates and members of the fac
ulty who had gathered to meet Dr.
and Mrs. Jordan. The reception
was an informal one, but was one
of the most enjoyable events of the
week. Old friends were given the
handshake, and some who had gone
through college together without
meeting met on the eve of their en
trance into the ranks of alumni.
