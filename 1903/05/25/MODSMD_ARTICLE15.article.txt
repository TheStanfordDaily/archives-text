# BACCALAUREATE SERMON.
## Dr. R. Heber Newton Talks to Graduates of 1903 on "The Patterns on the Mount." 
### 
Baccalaureate services began at
11 o'clock in Memorial Church.
Rev. R. Heber Newton preached
on "The Patterns on the Mount."
Special music was played by Or
ganist Scott Brook. Miss Sue Bird,
'03, sang Barnby's "The Soft
Southern Breeze." Dr. Newton said:
For every life that exists, for
every work that is to be done, as a
calling of God, there is a pattern in
the heavens. For every man and
woman there is an ideal of his or
her life, which is none other than
the divine idea, God's thought of
what he or she should be and what
he or she should do. The true suc
cess of life lies in the loyal follow
ing of these heavenly patterns —
the real failures in life are found
where these divine visions are lost
and lower working models are sub
stituted.
Dr. Newton then proceeded to
illustrate the subject in case of cer
tain leading vocations of life, the
man of business, the physician, the
lawyer, the journalist, etc. Under
the last heading he spoke as follows:
The college graduate who is look
ing forward to the career of journal
ism is led up to the mount and he
holds there patterns shown him by
the Divine Hand, the true working
models of his professional career.
He sees in the years before him the
reporter who will tell the truth
whatever it may cost; who will
make up no lies when facts are too
scant to furnish his column; who
will suppress scandal though it
might make an interesting tidbit
for the news department; who will
respect the privacy of the home;
who will act like a gentleman al
ways. He sees the editorial writer
in the years still further ahead
writing as he honestly believes, ex
pressing his sincere convictions.
And then the enthusiastic young
newspaper man comes down from
his mount of vision, into the chill,
damp air of the valley, where men
are crowding one another in the
mad scramble for success, and he
sees that the men who are forging
ahead have their eyes upon other
working models than those once
shown him upon the mount. He
observes the reporter who becomes
a sleuthhonnd on the track of every
scandal, intent on tracing it to its
lair and dragging its beastliness
out from the hiding place of dark
ness into the pitiless publicity of
the light; the wretch who, to make
up a telling article, does not shrink
from exploring the sewers of a great
city and stirring up dilig ntly its
rotting Hastiness and its foul-smell
ing prurimcies, mindless of the
smutch and smeal upon his own
garments, if so be that he can bring
some most offensive bit of offal up
to the surface of society as worry
meat for the human hounds. He
discerns in the years still further
ahead the editorial writer who does
not hesitate to sell his pen to the
highest bidder in the journalistic
market; who writes one day on be
half of the tariff and the next on
behalf of free trade, as ordered by
his business manager; mindless of
what reputations are ruined or
careers are blighted, so that he has
a brilliant and slashing article over
which the whole town will talk for
twenty-four hours. He sees the
business manager who will succeed
in building up a great paper, with
a huge circulation, and a vast ad
vertising business, but a paper

which beclouds all ideals, stifles all
enthusiasms, betrays all convic
tions, and shadows life with sin and
suffering.
Men and women live and die in
a full blindness that they have
turned away their eyes from the
patterns on the mount and have
been following other and lower
working models in their careers.
What doth it profit a man if he
gain the whole world and lose out
of him his own life? What doth it
profit him if he gains all success in
life and loses that for which suc
cess alone is worth anything: man
hood, character? There are suc
cessful men who gain the whole
world in their own careers, but are
morally bankrupt, spiritually im
poverished, beggared in character.
Our whole country is today re
membering with gratitude to God
the life and work of our foremost
man of letters, Ralph Waldo Emer
son. No higher eulogy can be paid
to a man than that paid him by
Matthew Arnold when he called
him "the friend of those who would
walk in the spirit." His life rein
forced his teachings.
Young ladies and young gentle
men of the Class of '03, during these
days you are closing the door be
hind you upon your career of pre
paration; you are opening the door
before you on your career of work.
Your Alma Mater has done for you
what she could to fit you for
life. She has given you sound in
struction and thorough training,
accurate knowledge and careful
discipline, wise guidance and
lofty inspiration. From the living
teacher you have doubtless learned
more than the printed book, both
for knowledge and for wisdom,
which is higher than knowledge.
For the last time you gather for
worship in this holy place, hence
forth sacred to you by many hal
lowing memories. Here amid the
last weeks of your studies you
have come to culture your souls in
character; to learn of Him who is
supreme Master and Teacher of our
being; here upon the sacred mount,
in the quiet hours of thought, in
holy words of worship, the patterns
have been shown you. Life opens
for you as full of promise as nature
on this bright day. Life is as full
of rich, sweet joy as in nature's
teeming existence around you, if
like these the life of man is true to
nature's law, to God's thoughts, to
the pattern shown upon the mount.
You chn all, doubtless, with the
training that you have received,
and with the ability that God has
given to you, make successes in
your careers. Will you make of
these careers the highest success —
the success which God will own as
he smilingly welcomes you in the
last great day, "Well done, good
and faithful servant." To you
these days seem like the finishing
of your education; to the older
heads they seem the beginning of
the highereducation —theeducaiion
which shall continue on through
life, from which you will graduate
into the skies with honor, maybe.
Let this simple service here be a
sacrament to you, a consecration
to the one true end and aim of life,
—the keeping of your souls resolu
tely upon the pattern shown upon
the mount. Then when your last
hour comes, the sweetest solace of
that awful moment, the one com
fort and stay in that dread experi
ence may be yours as you can
breathe your soul out to the God
who gave it in the great cry of
Christ: "I have finished the work
which Thou gavest me to do."
