# I VISIT TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
## 
### 
This little book, by Mary Stewart
Quelle, gives accurate information con- 1
cerning the University and its environ
ments in a most beguiling way. JoeCol
-1 ins, a "typical Stanford alumnus,"
brings bis father and mother and his
young cousin, Grace Hooper, to the Uni
versity "for a day's sightseeing." They
take a carriage ami drive about from one
point of interest to another.
Stopping first at the Mausoleum, "be
cause," as Joe says,"the Senator and
the boy lie there, and if they had never
lived there would be no Stanford Uni
versity today," they "take a turn
around the Cactus Garden," stop a few
minutes at the Museum, drive round by
Roble, and enter the Quadrangle by the
east gate, so that they might "see the
Inner Quad as it appeared to the Pio
neers." Crossing the Quadrangle, they
enter the Memorial Church. Joe shows
them the great organ with its "forty-six
stops, thirty miles of wire, three thous
and pipes and the swellest front ever
made," and calls their attention to the
apse with "its white marble altar,
and its three great allegorical windows,
with figures of the prophets, of heroic
size in mosaic work above them, and
marble statues of the twelve apostles
below." They linger there awhile gazing
at the beauty all about; then go to the
Library, and after luncheon at the run
stroll round the campus, and over to
Encina Hall, where they are to meet the
carriage.
They spend some time at the Hall
while Joe talks of Pioneer days, when
"there wasn't any post-office nearer
than Mayfield, only one or two houses
in Palo Alto, and only four trains a day
and they bad to be flagged!" They
drive down to Escondite, from there to
Frenchman's Lake, and 011 past Lagunita
to the Stock Farm; then around by the
Old Adobe, and through the grounds of
the residence. Finally they arrive once
more at the gate, return to the station
and board the train for San Francisco,
after having spent, as all agree, "a most
delightful day."
Joe as guide is, of course, well in
formed on every subject and gives con
cise accounts of the frieze on the Arch,
the Camp,the Stock Farm, the Old Adobe,
and the Palo Alto, lie has all the love
and enthusiasm of the Stanford alumnus
for his Alma Mater â€”as he says "A fel
low can't help taking the most intense
interest in everything that goes on
there. ... As I>r. Jordan says, 'it, is a
royal experience when one's own youth
and that of bis university come to
gether.' "
The remarks and criticisms of the
party throughout are bright and inter
esting, and there are many little touches
of humor.

excellent illustrations, including por
traits of Senator and Mrs. Stanford, Le
! land Stanford Jr., and I>r. Jordan; as
; well as views of the Church, exterior and
