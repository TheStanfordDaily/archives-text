Climate is an essential requisite
for an enjoyable and healthful
vacation. In California where
climate is all good it is well to
know where the best can be found.
Look along the California North
western Railway and you will find
it. The road runs through the
large and fertile Marin, Sonoma,
Santa Rosa, Russian River, Ukiah
and Willits valleys. A heavily
wooded mountain range bounds
this section on the west and pro
tects it from the fogs and cold
winds of the Pacific Ocean. Another
range on the east separates it from
the healed section of the interior.
In the valleys and wooded hills of
this section, so well protected, is
found a varied and most salubrious
climate; mineral springs, rivers,
lakes and streams in every direc
tion. Every taste and want can be
satisfied here, and in accord with a
moderate or well-filled purse. To
help in the selection of a place for
your summer outing, the California
Northwestern Railway publishes
every year a book called "Vaca
tion." This year's edition, ''Vacation
1903," contains over 100 pages,
beautifully illustrated, and is com
plete in its detailed information in
regard to mineral spring resorts,
selectcamping spots, country homes
and farms, where summer boarders
are taken; giving location, accom
modations and attractions, together
with the terms, which range from
$7.00 per week up. To be had at the
offices of the company, or by mail
in response to a letter addressed to
R. X. Ryan, the General Passenger
Agent.
