Graduates of this University:
111 addressing you today, I do not
wish to dwell on the past of your
University career, nor do I wish to
congratulate you too loudly on your
present achievement. I wish to
draw your attention to the future.
You are here for "Commencement"
as Bachelors of Arts, Masters of
Arts, Doctors ' of Philosophy,
Bachelors of Laws, Engineers,
etc.
For "Commencement," which
meant originally at Cambridge what
was called "Acts" at Oxford: The
"solemnitie" of the clay when the
"full degree" of Master or Doctor
was taken, the degree which con
ferred the privilege of using certain
hooks, or rather of pursuing certain
studies, and also the right of lectur
ing and receiving money for lec
tures.*
We include the Bachelor's and
other degrees in our lists of honor at
this "solemnitie," and may interpret
the term as meaning the celebration
of the day with which, if you desire
to become scholars, your proper
university work begins, and if you
intend to turn to other callings, your
life-work begins, that work for which
you have prepared at our University,
that great work which lies before
you and will fill your days, which the
world expects of you. The world
which in every direction, in every call
ing, depends on your help, your full
conscientious and competent help,
the work of your hands and brains
and hearts. The zvorld which ex
pects that the huge and heavy wheels
of its progress should be pushed on
by each generation to roll a little
farther in the direction of order, of
beauty, of knowledge, of goodness,
of health, of true happiness, of hu
man perfection; as some dream, in
the direction of a millennium 01* a
golden age. The world which will
on your gravestones not Ph. D.,
nor B. A., nor M. A., but which will
give you a full final examination in a
series of years longer or shorter until
the last roll-call shall he waiting for
your "Adsum."
Some of you are here as Bachelors,
and have finished the four years of
the college course; they are ready to
receive a degree which was originally
so humble that it was not even al
ways recognized as a degree. It
was a term most likely taken over
from the military sphere, where it
meant a young knight "not old
enough to display his own banner,"
and therefore following the banner of
another. At medieval Oxford the
examinations for "determination" o
tlie Bachelor's degree lasted nine
days and consisted chiefly of disputar
tions at the different "schools" for
the purpose of showing the logical
acumen and the dialectical skill of
the student. But the happy con
clusion of this "determination" con
ferred as a rule no privileges beyond
the wearing of a hood,f and at
Cambridge it meant nothing more
than that the student was now ad
mitted to the apprenticeship with a
*Anstey Muninientn Academica, 1,
lxxxviii. t Loc. cit., lxxxvi.

Master under whom he was to serve
for four years.'{
It meant then the beginning of
further studies, of higher studies;
and that is what I hope it should
mean for you.
There is a smaller group of you
here which prides itself in the more
ambitious title of Master. A title
which sounds so ambitious that St.
Francis forbade the use of it to his
followers, since there was only one
Master worthy of the name. But St.
Francis' injunction was not always
strictly followed even within his own
order, and the Middle Ages have
handed it down to our age, with
other things, good and bad.
It meant originally that the four
years of apprenticeship had been
completed, and that the holder of
the degree was not only permitted,
but had the duty to lecture on one of
those subjects which he had just
been taught. Only after he had
acquired this standing the scholar
was allowed to enter the study of
theology, law or medicine, which
meant another period of study of
eight or. ten years.
Our interpretation of the title of
M. A. would be that the first day's
journey has been finished in a syste
matic beginning of higher work, and
we interpret the title of Ph. I),
that about the third day's journey
has been completed, honestly and
honorably and well. In this inter
pretation everything points to the fu
ture, and this is the subject on which
I wish to dwell today. " Our Anni
versary is one of hope! " Let me take
these words of Emerson's as a text,
and grant me the privilege to give
certain observations, and to express
certain hopes, to formulate certain
"desiderata" which refer to that
group of sciences to which my own
belongs, the historical and philo
logical sciences. They are sister-dis
ciplines closely related in subject and
method, and in the past only too
often companions in misfortune, ex
periencing only too often the same
hardships, weathering the same
storms.
I wish to dwell 'on some prospects
which I cherish with regard to the
future of these studies at our own
University,—a future which is, of
course, in many respects closely bound
up with other questions of more gen
eral importance for the American
university.
The more hopeful we are of a bright
future, the more we should regard it
as our duty to help to bring this
about. Taking this for granted, any
criticism given frankly must be wel
come, and will, I trust, betaken with
wisdom and benevolence.
Healthy and honest criticism is
never destructive, it is never inspired
by the "spirit that hates and always
denies," but by the spirit which loves
and is creative.
If we consider the past develop
ment of the historical and philologi
cal sciences at our universities—
whatever our judgment may be as to
the present status —we must realize
that the progress has been rather slow,
and that the genuine progress which
we are happy to notice everywhere
is of comparatively very recent date.
We must realize that the progress
tMullinger's History of the Univer
sity of Cambridge, 25.

of higher work in our disciplines was
necessarily slow during that long
period of the history of American
higher education which we might
call the period of the English college
ideals. It was the period of pre
scribed text-book study, of instruc
tion in a narrow range of subjects,
of methods which varied little in
character from those in vogue during
the Middle Ages. Higher and freer
development of scholarly work was
necessarily hampered, for the simple
reason that the college as it had de
veloped from its medieval prototype
served other purposes entirely than
the advancement of scientific studies
of any kind.
Its object had become drill in the
classics, in some of the classics, and
in mathematics, in some of the math
ematics, and ''culture" to be gained
more or less mysteriously through
such drill.
It would be unfair to blame an in
stitution for not achieving what lay
avowedly outside f>f,its,« sphere, but
we must state the fact all the same
that the spirit of investigation, of
scholarly work, which.constitutes the
possibility of scientific "progress, lay
outside of the college ideals.
All the scholarly work done dur
ing this period was done independ
ently of tlie college, often by college
men, often by college professors, but
without vital encouragement from
the college, and always without refer
ence to its methods.
The period of emancipation of the
colonies from the mother-country
was the first period during which
plans for a new American university
were formed, ideals cherished of a
university on a larger and freer scale.
I need here only quote the names of
Jefferson, Washington, Joel Barlow,
Samuel Blodget, Benjamin Rush, and
Madison. I need only allude to
those interesting movements which
led to the first foundation of learned
and scientific societies in the Republic
which seemed destined to bring
|about the first renaissance of scholar
ly spirit ' arid achievement in this
country. It was the time when John
Adams revived Beaurepaire's [1788]
plans national academy of arts
land Sciences [ISO 2], when Cutbush
founded the Columbian Institute
[1821], patronized by Monroe and
John Quincy Adams, the time of John
Quincy Adams' plea for the erection
of an astronomical observatory re
ceived with "shouts of ridicule" in
America, and With praise in England $
The times were, unfortunately, not
ripe yet. The'tradition of the col
leges had not prepared the soil widely
enough for higher scientific ideals:
The great plans of great men were
allowed to wither. If it had been
otherwise we should be able to date
back not without a feeling of pride,
the founding of the first American
university to the last years of the
eighteenth century.
The illustrious American scholars
who received their training, or at
least the better part of their training,
and all of their inspiration at Euro
pean, especially German, universities
since the days of Everett, Ticknor
and Bancroft, must be regarded as the
pioneers of a new movement which
gradually matured during a period of
about fifty years, between 1820 and
1870. A movement which has given
the distinctive stamp to a second
great era of the devolopment of
higher education in America, the era
of the university ideal.
/
# G. Brown Goode's excellent sketch
of "The Origin of the National Scientific
and Educational Institutions," in the an
nual report of the American Historical
Association, iSSy, p. 101.

The first pulse of this new move
ment was clearly felt by young
Emerson, then a senior at Harvard,
who late iii life described the change
which took place when Everett re
turned from Germany. His words
are :|| "Germany had created criti
cism in vain for us until 1820, when
Edward Everett returned from his
five years in Europe, and brought
to Cambridge his rich results, which
110 one was so fitted by natural grace
and the splendor of his rhetoric to
introduce and recommend. Hemade
us for the first time acquainted with
Wolfi's theory of the Homeric writ
ings and with the criticism of Heyne.
The noveltyof the learning lost noth
ing in the skill and genius of his rela
tion, and the rudest undergraduate
found a new morning opened to him
in the lecture-room of Harvard
Hall."
This is the period in which, keenly
felt by George Bancroft after his re
turn from Germany in 1821, the
Spirit and the scholarship of the Ger
man university pointed out the way
for improvement, set 11s free. This
is the period the fruit of which we
have been fortunate in seeing ripen.
A progress was inaugurated then
which tills us with profound grati
tude towards the great men that
b ought it about, a gratitude which
will find its best expression if we do
our share in removing carefully but
firmly the last traditional obstacles.
The main one of these, the great
est hindrance to a fuller and freer de
velopment of higder studies at our
universities, is doubtless the lack of a
clear and universal recognition of the
difference between college and uni
versity, between college work and
university work, between college
method and university method. The
amalgamation of these two institu
tions, wherever we see it today, has
done infinite harm to both. Each
has suffered under what the
other imposed upon it. Each of
these fills a necessary place, has a
high mission to perform, but a differ
ent misssion,—each dependson a vital
difference of methods, is built on a
different foundation, addresses a dif
ferent set of students, different ages
of life.
Making certain allowances for dif
ference of opinion as to detail, there
seems to be full consent as to the two
main objects of the college. Its first
purpose is to give the foundation for
culture essential to the "gentleman" or
the "lady," the man or woman of the
world, the future' business man. Its
second purpose! is to furnish over and
above such general -culture more
special' and h§lp to the fu
ture scholar, tile lutiii^'specialist.
The first of these might be called
the older' English ideal of T the college.
It is a high ideal and sure of our ab
solute respect, because it is absolutely
necessary that there should be an
educational institution where every
thinker, man and woman, might be
furnished not only with a general
basis of certain multifarious informa
tion, but also with the means of a
clear observation and a sound judg
ment, a higher school, where the
mind and manners should be refined
and the moral force strengthened.
The most serious criticism to be
made on this first and original purpose
of the college is that it has often led
to the mistake that "culture" can be
acquired in a mysterious way by at
jterrfting ,certain lectures exactly for
ifour years; that "culture" is a patent
'medicine which can be dispensed in
tea- and tablespoons of learning with

New England: Works 10, 312.
a pedant at the desk and a fashionable
tailor in the background. "Culture"
cannot be "taught"; to acquire it
costs a lifetime, if not the lives of more
than one generation.
The recipes by which this first pur
pose of the college was accomplished
have varied, the medicines have be
come stronger and stronger, and af
ter a long siege of somewhat deterior
ated survivals, immensely improved
prescriptions have been made use of
during the latter half of the nineteenth
century, the most revolutionary one
being the principle of elective studies
first carried out consistently* at Har
vard since 1869. A principle which
has not only transformed a "provincial
college" into a "national university,"
but which has had thegreatest reform
ing influence everywhere. It is a prin
ciple recognized almost fifty years
before it produced this great revolu
tion, and is clearly described in a let
ter of Jefferson's to Ticknor (June 16,
1823). These are Jefferson's words:
"I am not fully informed of the
practices at Harvard, but there is one
form which we shall certainly vary,
although it has been copied, I be
lieve, by nearly every college and
academy in the United States. That
is holding the students all to one
prescribed course of reading, and
disallowing exclusive application to
those branches only which are to
qualify them for the particular voca
tions to which they are destined.
We shall, on the contrary allow them
uncontrolled choice in the lectures
they shall choose to attend, and re
quire elementary qualification only
and sufficient age."
The later stages of the college
history are marked by the strength
ening of the university ideal. The
ball on the pendulum was raised
higher and higher, and the hands on
the dial inclined to do their day's
work in twelve hours.
The college has had the tendency
to slight the general culture side
and what Jefferson calls the "ele
mentary qualification"; it has tried
to become a little university, a uni
versity in a nutshell. This tendency
may have had its good side, but it
cannot be denied that its influence
has been in the main harmful.
We have seen specialists anxious
to perform their best pieces before a
necessarily unappreciative audience.
We have seen specialists trying to
create specialists from the freshman
year. We have seen freshman "dis
sertations" and heard students "dis
cuss" the "problems" of Roman
constitutional history, who could not
translate "mensa est rotunda." We
have seen sophomore "seminaries"
and appalling bills of fare printed in
the registers of third-rate colleges.
Paper is almost as patient as the
public.
In cases of such wonderfully pre
pared specialists,little or nothing was
left to do for the real university; at
least in the eyes of the superficial
judge, of the philistine and the ped
ant. In two directions were seen the
pretense of such attempts and their
immorality because they produced
a conceit among such half barbarians
which has become almost a sign of
the times.
The college, trying to serve two
masters, had done this with the old
result: it had slighted that very part
of its duties for which it was best
fitted, and, on the other hand, it had
not served as a faithful handmaiden
to the university.
Its top-heavy infant prodigies were
not able to stand firmly on their feet.
This kind of premature specialization
did not "wear."
*Htl. Rep., 137.

The university suffered in the his
torical and philological sciences in
every respect under the ill fate of
having to work with materials insuf
ficiently prepared, of having to deal
with students who were scarcely able
to see their own limitations, or saw
them only when it was to*o late to
mend.
A student of history found too late
that he wanted more Latin, German,
French ; a student of English had
"specialized" in Browning, or Sid
ney Lanier, in Dryden, Pope, and
knew all the rime-schemes of the
sonnet from Wyatt to Wordsworth,
but he had difficulties with the Latin
quotations in Chaucer and Langland,
and had'to read Tacitus in a transla
tion. His reading knowledge of
French and German was most shaky.
He could not read Goethe's Shak
spere oration, and Beljame and
Jusserand had written for him in
vain. From translations he knew
Homer and Vergil and the Greek
drama, but Seneca he could not
translate, and if he was able to spell
some of the English words of Greek
origin (from Webster) he did not
know their meaning, and in the
study of the drama the word cata
strophe brought about his own col
lapse.
He was woefully ignorant of the
history and geography of England,
and worse than that he had been
taught to think he knew it all.
It was impossible to arouse even an
interest in the sources of English
history, constitutional, political, so
cial. And the history of English
thought had no claim upon his at
tention. He had been drilled in all
sorts of things, but he had not re
ceived the proper tools for later
work. The college had tried to
teach him what lay outside of its
sphere, and the university was asked
to build 011 the quicksand of an insuf
ficient preparation.
The lack of a proper recognition of
the boundary line between college
and university was further seen in
the confusion of method. The uni
versity method, which presupposes a
mature and well equipped student
working in the atmosphere of perfect
independence, was fettered and bound
and introduced into a schoolroom.
The schoolroom method, controlled
work, was supposed to be tolerated
in the university. Petty oversight,
pedantic stickling, was expected to
benefit high work. The professor
was supposed to become the peda
gogue and drill-master of mature men,
his whole sphere was degraded, true
university work was made impos
sible.
The history of the insight into the
fundamental difference between col
lege work and university work is a
rather long one.
We find some interesting remarks
on "the college in the American
sense" and"the university in the
European sense" in the correspond
ence referring to Jefferson's great
foundation in Virginia,t and George
Bancroft,who had first learned to ap
preciate the difference in Germany
endeavored, in 1821 at Harvard, to
use his own words, "to divide more
exactly preliminary studies from
the higher scientific courses and thus
to facilitate the transformation of our
colleges into universities." He con
cludes by saying that it was"not easy
to change an organization which has its
roots in the habits of the country." J
With his revolutionary ideals he was
swimming against the stream, and

versity of Virginia, p. 76.

versity which Germany was beginning
to preach, was brought to deaf ears.
It was the best gift which Germany
had made to the world since the
Reformation, but in this country the
time was not ripe yet. and the gift
was not accepted.
But truth is stronger even than the
"habits" of a country, and during
the slow process of half a century
Bancroft's ideas have made their way,
finding their crowning recognition in
the plan of the Johns Hopkins Univer
sity. Here the country received the
first great object lesson as to what a
university can and ought to do.
The university has become recog
nized now everywhere as the place,
first, where a competent scholar intro
duces competent students to their
chosen subject; secondly, where the
present state of our knowledge in the
different disciplines is historically,
critically and systematically de
scribed ; where stock is taken of what
we know; where the results of the
world's work are brought before ma
ture students; and thirdly, where the
student is methodically trained by
independent research to widen the
field of our knowledge.
Of the incidental results of such
training, I mention only one, viz., the
necessary moral effect on the char
acter and the life of the serious stu
dent. If his training was broad as
well as deep, if his guide was wise as
well as learned, there is little feftr of the
multiplication of pedants, and there
is absolutely no fear that the student
will not become a most valuable
citizen.
Finally, the university has become
more and more recognized as the
place where not only a traditional
selection of subjects is treated, as in
the medieval college, but where the
whole range of the sciences is repre
sented, where scholarship in any
branch of human knowledge can be
acquired (the idea of Jefferson and
Ezra Cornell). This seems to be the
modern interpretation of the medieval
term universitcis, which historically
referred only to the ' 'corporation,'' the
combination of teachers and taught.
This seems to be the most fitting
modern translation of what in the
Middle Ages was called a studium
generate or an academia (in the orig
inal sense of a teaching institution).
One of the most important results
of such a broad interpretation of the
term has been the insight into the
principle of the interdependence of
all branches of science. In our own
branch the fact is beginning every
where to be recognized that the his
torian cannot spare the help of the
philologist nor the philologist the
help of the historian.
In America unfortunately the
English tradition has had a tendency
to separate the study of some impor
tant branches of human learning from
the universities. Speaking of the
historical sciences, I refer to certain
parts of the study of law and theol
ogy. We have adopted in this
country the English "habit" of "pro
fessional schools" and have acquiesced
in it. But it has resulted in retard
ing the development of the higher
work in these sciences, it has led to
the wrong impression that practical
training in these "professions" is their
main end, that these studies are 110
"sciences." The "professions," how
ever, are beginning to take their due
place at our largest universities, and
in consequence they have been
brought to a higher level.
The disadvantages of the old system
of separation are as great for the
"professions" as for the university
disciplines. The professional studies
have suffered, they have lacked the
persistent stimulus of essential collat
eral studies, they have always been
in danger of sinking to mere ma
chines turning out by the shortest
process possible insufficiently pre
pared men.
Such professional "schools" of the
bad type have turned out theologians,
"doctors of theology" not able to
read the Bible in the original lan
guages, unprepared to answer even
elementary questions as to the his
tory of the church and the dogma,
preachers not able to hold a better
trained class of men. Such pro
fessional "schools" have turned out
lawyers who were in the best case
shrewd practitioners, lacking not
only legal "learning" but also the
scientific altitude in which the spirit
of the true jurist can alone live.
They have produced such conditions
as the ones now prevailing in this
country where a student of history
of the church, or of New Testament
criticism, of Semitic languages and
archeology, or of English law, of
civil law, of Germanic law, has
little choice of where to turn. An
enibarras de pauvrete which becomes
luimiliatingly clear if we turn, e.g.,
the catalogues of our law schools
with the hope of finding any number
of institutions where the history or
the system of civil law is taught by
an authority on the history of English
law. *
The universities have suffered
just as much, and far too long, under
the lack of the broadening influences
of a full corps of first-class represent
atives of all the essential disciplines.
Until a fairly recent time some of our
institutions were haunted by that
miserable ghost of the "useful arts
and sciences," first seen in the
eighteenth century. We still read of
"enlightened governors" making a
selection of university branches "de
pending on the requirements of a
given people at a given period."
Any "selection" from the sciences
would medievalize the modern univer
sity, which was clearly defined bv a
Jefferson as comprehending "the
whole circle of the arts and sciences"
and extending "to the utmost bound
aries of human knowledge." t
But where is this ideal realized ?
How few institutions recognize the
necessary affiliation of the essential
branches of the "historical and
philological sciences"? What a small
minority of American universities can
boast of professors of such disciplines
as the Semitic languages and arche
ology, American languages and arche
ology, Indo-Chinese and Eastern-
Asiatic languages, Indo-European
or "comparative" philology, the
history of philosophy, of the Chris
tian dogma (which as a historical dis
cipline is absolutely above the sectar
ian sphere), ancient (classical)
history and archeology, medieval
history, geography, ethnography,
ethnology, history of law, of poli
tics, and of art?
These and other disciplines will in
time be fully introduced, but as long
as this is not done, the often-quoted
remark of von Hoist holds true, that
there is not yet an American univer
sity, only torsi of universities. I
should like to change this term,
though, since a torso is the last relic
of a work of art belonging to a
glorious past, which latter is scarcely
justified in the history of the Amer
ican university. I should choose a
term at once more modest and more

: gradual recognition of the necessity
|of widening our university pro- j
! gramme, of introducing new disci
' plines often in the face of discourag
: ing conditions irrespective of their
popularity, marks the beginning of a
I great university era. A new era to be
realized under the best auspices in
the near future. Hut to be brought!
about only if we first clearly see
the necessity and wisely plan this new
course.
Let us take the first step and con
fess that, in the historical sciences at
least, the progress has been anything
but rapid. Of course conditions have
changed fur the better, at least as far
as the greater institutions are con
cerned. Great progress has been made
since the forties of the nineteenth
century, when we read of twenty
four professors at Harvard and
twelve tutors struggling to give in
struction in all the sciences; when
instruction in all the modern
languages and literatures was given
by one man; when one man was pro
fessor of sacred, ancient and mod
ern history; when the conditions
which James Bryce recently described
as existing "within the memory of
man" at one of the greatest English
universities where there was one pro- j
lessor to teach history—natural as |
well as civil, were exactly to be j
found in America. These were the I
days when the graduate student was
in a dilemna graphically described
by President Oilman. I quote his!
own words:'}
"I remained a year at New Haven
as a resident graduate. President
Woolsev, whom I consulted, asked
me to read Rau's Political Economy
and come and tell him its contents;
I did not accept the challenge. I
asked Professor Hadley if I might
read Greek with him ; he declined
my proposal. Professor Porter did
give me some guidance in reading,
especially in German. I had many
talks of an inspiring nature with
Professor Dana —but on the whole I
think that the year was wasted. The
next autumn I went to Cambridge,
and called upon President Sparks,
to learn what opportunities were
there open. "You can hear Pro
fessor Agassiz lecture," he said, "if
you want to; and I believe Mr. Long
fellow is reading Dante with a class."
Great progress, I say, has been
made since these days, but can we
really boast of a logically consistent,
steady development between 1819,
when Jefferson's •magnificent plans
for the University of Virginia—so
much like ours at Stanford, to the
very arcades were approved by the
State Legislature; and 1876, the epoch
marked in the history of our univer
sities by the opening of John Hop
kins University ?
Does it really produce the feeling 1
of pride as over a great achievement
if we read§ of the establishment of
the "department of philosophy and
the arts for scientific and graduate
study" at Yale, not before 1847; of|
the first doctor's degree bestowed at j
an American university, in 1861; of
"some" graduate courses inaugur
ated at Michigan in 1858-9; of the
1 establishment of graduate lectures at j
I Columbia in 1858, "continued only 1
for one year" ; of five resident gradu- j
ates at Harvard in 1868 (there had [
been twelve in 181 1); of 44 graduate j
students at Princeton in 1877-8; of
3400 graduate students|| at all the
American universities in 1899? Can
we be proud of the fact that there

; was no chair of American
in this country before 1881 ? Nor a
chair in English before 1858, to be
followed nearly twenty years later by
the second in 1876 ? That there was
110 English seminary in this country
: before 1885?
Of course figures and dates do
not explain everything, and speaking
! of the progress of historical and phil
ological studies in this country we
should not leave out of account the
activity and lives of such eminent
scholars as we have every reason to
be proud of.

happened to find a copy of Bopp's
Sanskrit grammar among the things
his brother had brought home from
Germany in 1848) became professor
of Sanskrit "and modern languages"
(!) in 1854; that Andrew D. White
began his revolutionizing, and that
means Germanizing, of the historical
courses at Ann Arbor as early as
1857; that F. A. March created and
received the first professorship of the
English language and comparative
philology in 1858. We must re
member the pioneer work of such
j eminent scholars as Th. D. Woolsey,
since 1831 professor of Greek at
| Yale; of Noah Porter, since 1846; of
; Lieber, staggering under the "load of
five scientific disciplines : of modern
history, political science, interna
tional law, civil law, and common
I law, from 1857 to 1865."** We must
not forget F. J. Child, who became
professor of rhetoric and oratory in
1851, who gave his first lectures on
Anglo-Saxon and Middle English to
juniors in 1867-8, and received his
chair of English literature in 1876.
We must record the introduction of
the historical seminary at Ann Ar
bor through Herbert B. Adams in
1869. if
But where was the steady,
unhampered, logical growth, the uni
form advance in the whole field of
the historical and philological scien
ces between 1820 and 1876? Where
was the large crop of young scholars
round those masters, ready to con
tinue their work? Where was the
! great harvest of scientific work done
at our universities during this period?
Permit me to mention some more
of the difficulties which the progress
of our sciences has suffered. There
1 are two superstitions which it is high
time to give up
The first is the conception that the
exclusive aim of the university is
"teaching," that the university is
exclusively a teaching body (what
ever may be understood under the
term); that the university, as we find
it often expressed, exists for the sake
of the student.
This superstition springs from the
medieval conception that the scien
ces are stationary, that such station
ary sciences can be ' 'learned'' and
"taught," that the professor handles
in his teaching a wonderful intellect
ual spoon with which he deals out
the smaller or larger doses of learning
according to the requirements of the
J patient. It rests 011 a misconception
|as to the quality of the work at a
I modern university. It leaves out of
j consideration the fact that the pro
fesssor should not only at the begin
ning of his career stand at this height,
but that he must continue to remain
at this height. To stand still is to go
backwards for 110 one more than for

Work, in Annual Report of the American
i Historical Association, iKS<). p. 25.

the professor. He cannot grow un
less the first material conditions of
his work are liberally provided for.
His most sacred duty for his science,
as well as for his country, is to hand
down the highest scientific tradition to
the next generation, to secure the
steady progress of his science, to
hand the torch to posterity.
Even if the modern university is
decidedly a "teaching institution" —
this point distinguishes it from an
academy of sciences—it can teach
only by the daily renewed conquest
of new truth, by the teacher leading
in this conquest, and, in consequence
the university exists as much for the
sciences and the teacher as for the
taught. I do not forget that a man's
a man for a' that, if he is honest and
competent; but I must insist, in spite
of what ignorance and blindness
might sneeringly object, that
the teacher, as independent truth
seeker and as guide of the future
scholar of the next generation, is the
salt of the earth which must be kept
from losing its savor.
I have been astonished to find so
much in our educational literature on
"the university for the student," and
so little—if anything —on "the uni
versity for the professor."
The college may exist for the stu
dent, as does the elementary school
for the pupil, but the university
exists for the progress of science, of
tth(* fiighest ideals of the race, it re
presents the height of the intellectual
achievements of the race, and for this
reason the value and dignity of their
representatives cannot be exagger
ated, and no encouragement to the
university teacher as scholar can be
too great.
The second superstition, which has
particularly affected the progress of the
liistorical sciences, has in part sprung
from the powerful "renaissance" of
the natural sciences since the middle
of the nineteenth century, from influ
ences which appear especially strong
on people who live upon bread alone,
gp £Uph scholars as prefer to bury
themselves in the walls of their studies
and laboratories, taking no interest in
the progress of other sciences either in
telligent or benevolent, — in one word,
on the scientific revival of the human
istic pedant. This second supersti
tion has made it a universally accept
ed axiom that while the "apparatus"
of the natural sciences is most ex
pensive, the tools of the historical
scholar are cheap. Too readily ac
quiesced in by the historical scholar,
gladly accepted as a working prin
ciple by the administrations of our
universities, this strange delusion has
crippled almost everywhere the very
possibility of scholarly development
in the historical sciences.
I am speaking of the equipment
of books. Of course here also the
American university has made con
siderable progress within the last half
century. Hut, even if we can but
smile at such figures as are reported
from the forties when Harvard library
had "only 61,000 volumes, Yale
34,000; if we are happy that there
are now at least fifteen university
libraries with more than 100,000
volumes; we must insist on the lesson
taught by such facts as the one that
the best equipped university library
in this country spends $68,000 an
nually, whereas the two libraries
which furnish the equipment of the
student at Berlin, apart from the sums
spent for the special seminary libra
ries, have an annual expenditure of
$150,000. We must further realize
that the sums spent at the different

university libraries of Europe may
appear smaller than they really are,
if we convert them into dollars, but
they are spent at institutions with
book collections which have been ac
cumulating through centuries.
There are no more than six libra
ries in our country with a sufficient
equipment of books to enable the
advanced student to finish any piece
of research in classical, medieval,
ecclesiastical or English history, nor
would they be sufficient for the thor
ough study of almost any period of
the English language and literature.
I leave out here other languages
and literatures in which the geograph
ical situation of the country seems to
point to a remedy only sparingly
employed as yet: I mean traveling
furloughs which, granted at shorter
intervals, might ultimately take the
place of the sabbatical year.
The present precarious condition
of working facilities in the historical
and philological sciences has found its
reflection, naturally, in the scholar
ship, in the quality and the extent of
the work done at our universities. It
has crippled none more than the
younger scholar, the hope of the
coming generation.
In regard to the younger scholars,
what I said before 011 the lack of suf
ficient provision for the future, seems
to be corroborated.
We find in this country, 011 the
one hand, premature advancement of
untried teachers, and very young
students; and on the other hand, the
impossibility for a capable young
scholar of choosing the university
career for himself with perfect free
dom, uninfluenced by frown and favor,
unhampered by duties which have
nothing to do with advanced scholar
ship.
We find 110 university yet liberally
inviting the young scholar of prom
ise to settle down within its walls and
try for himself. Our road to a pro
fessorship passes too many dreary
stations of "elementary work," sta
tions where the greater part of our best
young men waste what ought to be
the most productive years of their
lives, —if not their whole lives.
There is no reason why our future
university teachers should all have to
enter their career through the college;
and there is certainly no reason, why
these, sufficiently prepared, should
not be encouraged from the start to
give one or two graduate courses.
The universities should not only
give an opportunity for such higher
teaching; but they should demand it,
make it one of the conditions of ad
vancement.
They should rejoice in a large schol
arly competition among the younger
men. In the philological depart
ments at least, the scholarly ambition
of the young instructor is stifled by
the weight of the most elementary
work, which has nothing whatever to
do with his own scholarly develop
ment. This occurs at a period of
life which ought to be the most ac
tive, which requires the greatest en
couragement, where the young tree
requires the most liberal watering.
There is no doubt that the high
excellence of the German universities
is due to an establishment which so
far has. not thriven in America. It
could not be expected to thrive on
the medieval soil of the earlier
American university. But it is time
to consider it more seriously. This
is the institution of " privat docent,"
a word which I would translate by
"lecturer," "reader," (and cer
tainly not by "fellow" or "assist
ant," because these names might
indicate too much dependence on
some "foundation," on some super
ior.) With rare exceptions, all the
great masters of the sciences have
evolved in Germany from this class
of "lecturers."
It is an institution based on the
principle that the best work can be
done only in absolute freedom, and
that especially at the start absolute
freedom of movement is necessary.
After George Bancroft had returned
from Berlin in 1821, when he was so
impressed by the conditions of the
college system, he "applied for leave
to read lectures on history" at Har
vard. He says himself: "At Gottin
gen or at Berlin, I had the right,
after a few preliminary formalities, to
deliver such a course. It was the
only time in my life that 1 applied for
an office for myself, and this time it
was not so much an office, as a per
mission, that I desired."* —But his
request was declined. There was no
room for a well-trained young scholar
at the oldest university in this coun
try, 110 room for him who did not
ask for financial support, who merely
wanted to lecture, to show what he
could do, to try his strength and
grow. He applied at a college more
medieval than the Middle Ages
themselves, and the doors were
closed to a modern demand.
How is it today ? Are the doors
of our universities open, wide open
for a young scholar who without any
worldly demand from our universities
should merely wish, properly tested,
to teach? What would the faculty
of Stanford say, if a young scholar of
decided ability, who, one or two
years after his doctorate (taken with
distinction) had given further proof
of high scholarly work and spirit,
should ask the privilege of using a
certain lecture-room at a certain hour
for a certain course of lectures?
What would Stanford University say,
if after a year or two this young man,
unprotected but regarded with a cer
tain degree of kindly benevolence,
such as might be expected among
gentlemen and scholars, if this "lec
turer" should attract more and more
students (not credit hunters), if he
should become an influence at the
university? What if the university
should become in the course of years
a perfect hive of such bees? If the
university had not hired assistants
only to clo elementary work under
the control of major professors, and
*Cf. his letter to President Kliot, July
4, 1S70, Harvard University catalogue,
I tj02—03, p. 493.

either by the very conditions of the
appointment, or defacto, kept strictly
in the sphere of elementary work, and
always kept more or less dependent
011 the good-will of a major professor,
but a company of high-aspiring
young scholars who first of all would
demand and find a sphere of unhamp
ered, undisturbed work and teaching.
Teachers, who, as it is in Germany,
by tradition and by sheer necessity
in the struggle for existence, should
turn out valuable work.
This need not exclude a combina
tion of such absolutely independent,
unpaid university work of the lectur
er with a minimum of well paid ele
mentary teaching in the college; in
some cases it might be desirable, in
some even necessary, but it should
be possible for a young man who has
the good fortune to be of indepen
dent means and of good brain, too,
to settle down at a university.
The inauguration of some such
course would have incalculable ad
vantages : it would emphasize the
distinctiction between college and
university ; it would modify our de
partmental boss-system, our worship
I of "credits" and other traits of the
secondary schools: it would stimulate
I scholarly life at the university; it
would keep up a healthy competition
, in scholarly work among the younger
men, promote the survival of the fit
test, keep older man from rusting ;
j and lastly, some such system would
I establish a national market, which
does not yet exist, where the best
| work of the younger generation is
; publicly exposed to view. It would
| counteract, finally, the disastrous sys
j tem of breeding in and in, which
has in only too many cases been a
necessary evil. It would bring about
far closer relations between the univer
sities, and give the coup de grace to the
more than medieval jealousy among
the higher institutions, smacking of
the college from which they have
; scarcely evolved, and often supposed
to represent the college spirit.
With this plea for the better provi
sion for the future university teacher,
' I may appear as having transgressed
, the boundaries of my original plan, of
speaking of some future possibilities
I of the historical and philological sci
! ences. I restrict then my plea to these,
to a sphere where it was first made
by the father of American historical
studies, and where it needs once more
to be made after the lapse of eighty
1 years.
The times are more ready for it

now than they were in 1821, because j
higher ideals have developed. The
college walls are 110 longer regarded j
as sufficiently spacious for the growth
of the American university.
Let me summarize what seem to
me the more important desiderata in
the field of the historical sciences:
First, a great increase in the num- j
ber of disciplines; secondly, a liberal
provision of working facilities;
thirdly, a liberal encouragement ofj
the young scholar, the master of the j
next generation.
In parting, graduates of this Uni
versity, let me leave with you one
word upon the moral effects of all
these struggles for the introduction
of higher ideals: the strength of the
scholar has become tried and proved,
the methods have become recognized
and improved. Par from any self
satisfaction, we need not be weighed
down with any feeling of lost time
and energy: we are ready for the
work of the day awaiting us.
Once more I recall to you the
significance of the term "Commence
ment, '' as the ' 'anniversary of hope,''
as the day when you were declared
free to begin your life-work.
You have received your instruc
tion and I hope more than instruc
tion, lasting inspiration, at an institu
tion which has before it all the possi
bilities of a great development, in
which it is the hope of your Alma
Mater that you will take part. In
j this respect I do not say to you
I "Farewell," but "Come again."
If it be your ide;J to devote
I yourselves to scientific work, lose
I not a single day. There is no
I science which is not in need of every
| competent brain and hand. If you
intend becoming teachers and pro
j fessional men, keep up scholarly
work, let not a day pass without it,
i "grow old learning." This alone
will give your work dignity, and put
you above the "insolence of office"
I and the "scorns of time."
Wherever life may take you, re
main one with us, remember that there
is only one worthy fellowship, that of
men of high purposes. Such pur
! poses alone elevate even the hum
blest work, such alone save our life
from emptiness, from passing "as
smoke in air or in the water-foam."
Let me close with a word from
j Emerson, whose centenary inspires
the country at this very hour with
the proud feeling that "he was ours":
'' The day is always his who works
in it with serenity and great aims."
