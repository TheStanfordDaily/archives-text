Graduates of this University:
111 addressing you today, I do not
wish to dwell on the past of your
University career, nor do I wish to
congratulate you too loudly on your
present achievement. I wish to
draw your attention to the future.
You are here for "Commencement"
as Bachelors of Arts, Masters of
Arts, Doctors ' of Philosophy,
Bachelors of Laws, Engineers,
etc.
For "Commencement," which
meant originally at Cambridge what
was called "Acts" at Oxford: The
"solemnitie" of the clay when the
"full degree" of Master or Doctor
was taken, the degree which con
ferred the privilege of using certain
hooks, or rather of pursuing certain
studies, and also the right of lectur
ing and receiving money for lec
tures.*
We include the Bachelor's and
other degrees in our lists of honor at
this "solemnitie," and may interpret
the term as meaning the celebration
of the day with which, if you desire
to become scholars, your proper
university work begins, and if you
intend to turn to other callings, your
life-work begins, that work for which
you have prepared at our University,
that great work which lies before
you and will fill your days, which the
world expects of you. The world
which in every direction, in every call
ing, depends on your help, your full
conscientious and competent help,
the work of your hands and brains
and hearts. The zvorld which ex
pects that the huge and heavy wheels
of its progress should be pushed on
by each generation to roll a little
farther in the direction of order, of
beauty, of knowledge, of goodness,
of health, of true happiness, of hu
man perfection; as some dream, in
the direction of a millennium 01* a
golden age. The world which will
on your gravestones not Ph. D.,
nor B. A., nor M. A., but which will
give you a full final examination in a
series of years longer or shorter until
the last roll-call shall he waiting for
your "Adsum."
Some of you are here as Bachelors,
and have finished the four years of
the college course; they are ready to
receive a degree which was originally
so humble that it was not even al
ways recognized as a degree. It
was a term most likely taken over
from the military sphere, where it
meant a young knight "not old
enough to display his own banner,"
and therefore following the banner of
another. At medieval Oxford the
examinations for "determination" o
tlie Bachelor's degree lasted nine
days and consisted chiefly of disputar
tions at the different "schools" for
the purpose of showing the logical
acumen and the dialectical skill of
the student. But the happy con
clusion of this "determination" con
ferred as a rule no privileges beyond
the wearing of a hood,f and at
Cambridge it meant nothing more
than that the student was now ad
mitted to the apprenticeship with a

Master under whom he was to serve
for four years.'{
It meant then the beginning of
further studies, of higher studies;
and that is what I hope it should
mean for you.
There is a smaller group of you
here which prides itself in the more
ambitious title of Master. A title
which sounds so ambitious that St.
Francis forbade the use of it to his
followers, since there was only one
Master worthy of the name. But St.
Francis' injunction was not always
strictly followed even within his own
order, and the Middle Ages have
handed it down to our age, with
other things, good and bad.
It meant originally that the four
years of apprenticeship had been
completed, and that the holder of
the degree was not only permitted,
but had the duty to lecture on one of
those subjects which he had just
been taught. Only after he had
acquired this standing the scholar
was allowed to enter the study of
theology, law or medicine, which
meant another period of study of
eight or. ten years.
Our interpretation of the title of
M. A. would be that the first day's
journey has been finished in a syste
matic beginning of higher work, and
we interpret the title of Ph. I),
that about the third day's journey
has been completed, honestly and
honorably and well. In this inter
pretation everything points to the fu
ture, and this is the subject on which
I wish to dwell today. " Our Anni
versary is one of hope! " Let me take
these words of Emerson's as a text,
and grant me the privilege to give
certain observations, and to express
certain hopes, to formulate certain
"desiderata" which refer to that
group of sciences to which my own
belongs, the historical and philo
logical sciences. They are sister-dis
ciplines closely related in subject and
method, and in the past only too
often companions in misfortune, ex
periencing only too often the same
hardships, weathering the same
storms.
I wish to dwell 'on some prospects
which I cherish with regard to the
future of these studies at our own
University,—a future which is, of
course, in many respects closely bound
up with other questions of more gen
eral importance for the American
university.
The more hopeful we are of a bright
future, the more we should regard it
as our duty to help to bring this
about. Taking this for granted, any
criticism given frankly must be wel
come, and will, I trust, betaken with
wisdom and benevolence.
Healthy and honest criticism is
never destructive, it is never inspired
by the "spirit that hates and always
denies," but by the spirit which loves
and is creative.
If we consider the past develop
ment of the historical and philologi
cal sciences at our universities—
whatever our judgment may be as to
the present status —we must realize
that the progress has been rather slow,
and that the genuine progress which
we are happy to notice everywhere
is of comparatively very recent date.
We must realize that the progress

sity of Cambridge, 25.

of higher work in our disciplines was
necessarily slow during that long
period of the history of American
higher education which we might
call the period of the English college
ideals. It was the period of pre
scribed text-book study, of instruc
tion in a narrow range of subjects,
of methods which varied little in
character from those in vogue during
the Middle Ages. Higher and freer
development of scholarly work was
necessarily hampered, for the simple
reason that the college as it had de
veloped from its medieval prototype
served other purposes entirely than
the advancement of scientific studies
of any kind.
Its object had become drill in the
classics, in some of the classics, and
in mathematics, in some of the math
ematics, and ''culture" to be gained
more or less mysteriously through
such drill.
It would be unfair to blame an in
stitution for not achieving what lay
avowedly outside f>f,its,« sphere, but
we must state the fact all the same
that the spirit of investigation, of
scholarly work, which.constitutes the
possibility of scientific "progress, lay
outside of the college ideals.
All the scholarly work done dur
ing this period was done independ
ently of tlie college, often by college
men, often by college professors, but
without vital encouragement from
the college, and always without refer
ence to its methods.
The period of emancipation of the
colonies from the mother-country
was the first period during which
plans for a new American university
were formed, ideals cherished of a
university on a larger and freer scale.
I need here only quote the names of
Jefferson, Washington, Joel Barlow,
Samuel Blodget, Benjamin Rush, and
Madison. I need only allude to
those interesting movements which
led to the first foundation of learned
and scientific societies in the Republic
which seemed destined to bring
|about the first renaissance of scholar
ly spirit ' arid achievement in this
country. It was the time when John
Adams revived Beaurepaire's [1788]
plans national academy of arts
land Sciences [ISO 2], when Cutbush
founded the Columbian Institute
[1821], patronized by Monroe and
John Quincy Adams, the time of John
Quincy Adams' plea for the erection
of an astronomical observatory re
ceived with "shouts of ridicule" in
America, and With praise in England $
The times were, unfortunately, not
ripe yet. The'tradition of the col
leges had not prepared the soil widely
enough for higher scientific ideals:
The great plans of great men were
allowed to wither. If it had been
otherwise we should be able to date
back not without a feeling of pride,
the founding of the first American
university to the last years of the
eighteenth century.
The illustrious American scholars
who received their training, or at
least the better part of their training,
and all of their inspiration at Euro
pean, especially German, universities
since the days of Everett, Ticknor
and Bancroft, must be regarded as the
pioneers of a new movement which
gradually matured during a period of
about fifty years, between 1820 and
1870. A movement which has given
the distinctive stamp to a second
great era of the devolopment of
higher education in America, the era
of the university ideal.

# G. Brown Goode's excellent sketch
of "The Origin of the National Scientific
and Educational Institutions," in the an
nual report of the American Historical
Association, iSSy, p. 101.

The first pulse of this new move
ment was clearly felt by young
Emerson, then a senior at Harvard,
who late iii life described the change
which took place when Everett re
turned from Germany. His words
are :|| "Germany had created criti
cism in vain for us until 1820, when
Edward Everett returned from his
five years in Europe, and brought
to Cambridge his rich results, which
110 one was so fitted by natural grace
and the splendor of his rhetoric to
introduce and recommend. Hemade
us for the first time acquainted with
Wolfi's theory of the Homeric writ
ings and with the criticism of Heyne.
The noveltyof the learning lost noth
ing in the skill and genius of his rela
tion, and the rudest undergraduate
found a new morning opened to him
in the lecture-room of Harvard
Hall."
This is the period in which, keenly
felt by George Bancroft after his re
turn from Germany in 1821, the
Spirit and the scholarship of the Ger
man university pointed out the way
for improvement, set 11s free. This
is the period the fruit of which we
have been fortunate in seeing ripen.
A progress was inaugurated then
which tills us with profound grati
tude towards the great men that
b ought it about, a gratitude which
will find its best expression if we do
our share in removing carefully but
firmly the last traditional obstacles.
The main one of these, the great
est hindrance to a fuller and freer de
velopment of higder studies at our
universities, is doubtless the lack of a
clear and universal recognition of the
difference between college and uni
versity, between college work and
university work, between college
method and university method. The
amalgamation of these two institu
tions, wherever we see it today, has
done infinite harm to both. Each
has suffered under what the
other imposed upon it. Each of
these fills a necessary place, has a
high mission to perform, but a differ
ent misssion,—each dependson a vital
difference of methods, is built on a
different foundation, addresses a dif
ferent set of students, different ages
of life.
Making certain allowances for dif
ference of opinion as to detail, there
seems to be full consent as to the two
main objects of the college. Its first
purpose is to give the foundation for
culture essential to the "gentleman" or
the "lady," the man or woman of the
world, the future' business man. Its
second purpose! is to furnish over and
above such general -culture more
special' and h§lp to the fu
ture scholar, tile lutiii^'specialist.
The first of these might be called
the older' English ideal of T the college.
It is a high ideal and sure of our ab
solute respect, because it is absolutely
necessary that there should be an
educational institution where every
thinker, man and woman, might be
furnished not only with a general
basis of certain multifarious informa
tion, but also with the means of a
clear observation and a sound judg
ment, a higher school, where the
mind and manners should be refined
and the moral force strengthened.
The most serious criticism to be
made on this first and original purpose
of the college is that it has often led
to the mistake that "culture" can be
acquired in a mysterious way by at
jterrfting ,certain lectures exactly for
ifour years; that "culture" is a patent
'medicine which can be dispensed in
tea- and tablespoons of learning with
