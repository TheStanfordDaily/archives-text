# ADDRESS BY DR. JORDAN.
## "The Stanford Man of the Twentieth Century" Delivered to the Graduating Class Commencement Day. 
### 
It is the purpose of this Univer
sity to develop a certain ideal type
of man. This we cull for our con
venience "the Stanford man." In so
far as we are successful this man
will have a good many of the vir
tues of character ; but we do not
mean to claim a monopoly of
them. A good Harvard man, a
good Yale man, a good Cornell
man, a good Oxford man, any of
these would make a good Stanford
man. A good fellow in the noble
sense is a good fellow anywhere.
The good university man has cul
ture, character, scholarship, gentle
breeding, and perseverenee. All
these we can count on in some
fair degree in all real university
circles. But within the range of
all this we are trying at Stanford
to do one thing more. What this
is we hope that your own lives as
graduates and those of the fifteen
hundred alumni who have preceded
you may well exemplify.
We have tried to make you men
and women of the times. We
have tried to fit you to respond to
the demands of the twentieth cen
tury. Your training, as your
life, has been cast not in
the thirteenth century of ca
thedral building, not in the
sixteenth century of the revolt
of the intellect, not in the eight
eenth century of constitution mak
ing, or even in the nineteenth cen
tury with its discovery of the real
ity of external things, and the
presence of God in all temples,
even those made by hands. It is
in the twentieth century that you
live, in the twentieth century that
you are to work, and for the twen
tieth century you have had your
training. It is for the work of the
twentieth century that you go out
today as Stanford men and wo
men.
The new century has come upon
us with a rush of energy that no
century has shown before. Let us
stand aside for a moment that we
may see what kind of a century it
is to he, what is the work it has to
do, and what manner of men it will
demand to do it.
In most regiirds one century is
like another. Just as men are men,
so times are times. Just as each
individual man has the same
organs, the same passions, the
same functions as all others,so it is
with all the cent uries. Not wars and
conquests mark a century. The
hosts grow small in the vanishing
perspective, "the captains and the
kings depart," but the thoughts of
men, their attitude toward their
environment, their struggles toward
duty, these are the things which
endure.
Compared with the centuries that
are past, the Twentieth Century in
its broad outlines will be like the
rest. It will be selfish, generous,
careless, devoted, fatuous, efficient.
Hut time of its traits must stand
out above all others, each raised to
a higher degree than any other
century has known. TheTwentieth
Century above all others will he
strenuous, complex and democratic.
Strenuous the century must be,
of course. This we can all see, and
we have to thank the young man of
the Twentieth Century who gave us
the watchword of "the strenuous

life" and who has raised the apt
phrase to the dignity of a national
purpose. Our century has a host
of things to do. If we are called to
help in this work, there is no time
for an idle minute. "The color of
life is red." Already the fad of the
drooping spirit, the end-of-the-cen
tury pose,Mhas given way to the
rush of the strenuous life, to the
feeling that struggle brings its own
reward. Life is repaid by the joy
of living it.
As the century is strenuous so
will it he complex. The complexity
of life is shown by the extension of
the necessity of choice. EacTt of us
has to render a decision, to say yes
or no, a hundred times when our
grandfathers were called upon a
single time. Through modern civil
ization we are coming into our
inheritance, and this heirloom in
cludes the best that any man has
done or thought since history and
literature and art began. Of one
blood are all the people of theearth,
and whatsoever is done to the least
of these little ones in some degree
comes to me. It is said that
through the bonds of commerce,
common trade and common need,
there is growing up the fund of a
great "bank of human kindness,"
no genuine draft on which is ever
left dishonored. Whoever is in
need of help the world over, by that
token has a claim on us.
In our material life we draw our
resources from every land. We
need the best work of every nation
and every nation asks our best of
us. The day of home-brewed ale,
of home-made bread and home-spun
clothing is already past with us.
With home made garments also pass
away inherited politics and hered
itary religion, with all the support
of caste and with all its barriers.
We must work all this out for our
selves; we must make our own
place in society; we must frame our
own creeds, we must live our own
religion; for no longer can one
man's religion be taken unquestion
ably by any other. With all this,
the simplicity of life is passing
away. The caravan traverses our
front yard. We speak to millions,
millions speak to us; and we must
cultivate the social tact, the gentle
ness, the adroitness, the firmness
necessary to carry out our own
designs without thwarting those of
others. Time no longer Hows on
evenly. We must he swift and
accurate in the part we play in a
drama so mighty, so strenuous and
so complex.
More than any of the others, the
Twentieth Century will be demo
cratic. The greatest discovery of
the Nineteenth Century was that
of the reality of external things.
If something needs doing, do it.
The more plainly,directly, honestly,
the better.
The earlier centuries cared little
for the life of a man. In masses
and mobs they needed kings and
rulers, but could not choose them.
The people could not follow those
they understood or who understood
them. They must trust all to the
blind chance of heredity. Not the
man who would do or think or help,
but the eldest son of a former lord
was chosen for their homage. The
result of it all was that no use

was made of the forces of nature;
for those who might have learned
to control them were hunted to
their death.
So in this strenuous and complex
age, this age of "fierce democracy,"
what have we to do, and with
what manner of men shall we
work? Young men of the Twen
tieth Century, will your limes find
place for you? There is plenty to
do in every direction. In agricul
ture a whole great empire is yet to
he won in the arid West; and the
West that is not arid and the East
that was never so, must he turned
into one vast market-garden. The
Twentieth Century will treat a farm
as a friend and it will yield rich
returns for such friendship. In the
Twentieth Century vast regions will
he fitted to civilization, not by im
perialism, which blasts, but by
permeation, which reclaims.
There is need of men in forestry;
for we must win hack the trees we
have slain with such ruthless hand.
Every man who masters what is al
ready known in any one branch of
applied science, makes his own for
tune. Me who can add a little,
save a little, do something better or
something cheaper, makes the for
tune of a hundred others. "There
is always room for a man of force,
and he makes room for many."
There iB no limit to the demands
of engineering. Sunshine and fall
ing water can be tramsmuted into
power. This power already lights
the cities of California, and some
day it may be changed into the heat
which moves a thousand factories.
From end to end of the continent
the Twentieth Century will bring
gold to light, and the mining engi
neer who knows the mountains best
finds his fortune ready to his hand.
Whoever knows how to manage
things or men, finds an eager wel
come. There are never too many
of those who know how; but the
day of the rule of thumb has long
since passed. The engineer of to
day must create, not imitate. And
to him who can create,'this last cen
tury we call the Twentieth, is yet
part of the first day of Creation.
In commerce, the field is always
open for young men. The world's
trade is barely yet begun. We
hear people whining over the spread
of the commercial spirit, but what
they mean is not the spirit of com
merce. Through commerce grows
tolerance, and through tolerance,
peace and solidarity. Freedom
breeds commerce as commerce de
mands freedom. When China is a
nation, her people will be no longer
a "yellow peril."
There are ten vessels today pass
ing in and out of the Golden Gate
to one in 1880. Another twenty
five years will see a hundred times
as many. We have discovered the
orient, â€”and even more, the orient
has discovered us. We may not
rule it by force of arms; for that
counts nothing in trade or civiliza
tion. Commerce follows the flag
only when it Hies on merchant
ships. Commerce follows fair play
anil mutual service. The centuries
of war have only played at com
merce. The Twentieth Century will
take it seriously,and it will call for
men to do its work. It will call
more loudly than war has ever
done, but it will ask its men not to
die bravely, but to live wisely, and
above all, truthfully, to watch their
accounts.
The reward of pure science will
be, in the future as in the past, of
its own kind, not fame nor money,
but the joy of knowing. To the
student of nature, money means
only the power to do more or better
work.
Most of the books the Twentieth
Century will print will not be lit
erature, for idle books are written
for idle people, and many idle peo
ple are left over from less insistent
times. The literature of form is
giving way already to the literature
of power. We care less and less
for the surprises and scintillations
of clever fellows; we care more and
more for the real thoughts of real
men. We find that the deepest
thoughts can be expressed in the
simplest language.
In medicine, the field of action
is growing infinitely broader, now
that its training is securely based
on science, and the divining rod no
longer stands first among its im
plements of precision. There is
room for no more doctors whose
highest conception is to look wise,
take chances, and pocket the fee;
room for no more doctors, now when
the doctor must be an honest man,
with a sound knowledge of the hu
man body and a mastery of the
methods of the sciences on which
this knowledge depends.
What is true of medicine applies
also to the profession of law. The"
law is not a device for getting
around the statutes. It is the
science and art of equity. The
lawyers of the future will not be
u ere pleaders before juries; they
will save their client* from need of
judge or jury.
In politics, the demand for ser
ious service must grow. We shall
demand not only men who can
lead in action, but men who can
prevent unwise action. Often the
policy which seems most attractive
to the majority, is full of danger
for the future. We need men who
can face popular opinion, and if
need be, to face it down.
As we look at it in the rough, the
political outlook of democracy of
ten seems discouraging. A great,
rich, busy nation cannot stop to see
who grabs its pennies. We are
plundered by the rich, we are rob
bed by the poor, and trusts and un
ions play the tyrant over both.
But all these evils are temporary.
The men that have solved greater
problems in the past will not he
balked by these.
In all this, the journalist of the
future may find an honorable place,
lie will learn to temper enterprise
with justice, audacity with fidelity,
omniscience with truthfulness. To
mould public opinion, to furnish a
truthful picture of the times from
day to day, either of these ideals
in journalism gives ample room for
the play of the highest manly en
ergy.
It is said that the teacher's nob
lest work is to lead the child to his
inheritance. This is the inheritance
he would win; the truth that men
have tested in the past, and the
means by which they were led to
know that it was truth. "Free
should the scholar be, â€”free and
brave."
The religion of this century will
be more practical, more real. It
will deal with the days of the week
as well as with the Sabbath. It
will be as patent in the marts of
trade as in the walls of a cathedral,
for a man's religion is his working
hypothesis of life, not of life in
some future world, but of life light
here today, the only day we have
in which to build a life. The world
of today will be a world of
and color and joy, a world in which
each of us may have a noble, though

humble, part. It will find religion
in love and wisdom and virtue.
It is the loyalty to duty, the love
of God through the love of men,
which may transform the workshop
to a cathedral.
What sort of men does the cent
ury need for all this work it has to
do? We may be sure that it will
choose its own, and those who can
not serve it, will be cast aside un
pitying. Those it can use, it will
pay generously, each after its kind,
some with money, some with fame,
some with the sense of power, some
with the joy of service. Some will
work hard in spite of vast wealth,
some only after taking the vow of
poverty.
Those not needed you can find
any day. They lean against lamp
posts in platoons, they crowd the
saloons, they stand about railway
stations all day long to see trains
go by. They dally on the lounges
of fashionable clubs. They may
be had tied in bundles by the
employers of menial labor. You
whom the century wants must be
the spirit of the times, strenuous,
complex, democratic.
A young man is a mighty reser
voir of unused power. Men of
training the century must demand.
It is impossible to drop into great
ness. It is as easy to do great
things as small, if you only know
how. The only way to learn to do
great things is to do small things
well, patiently, loyally. No wise
man begrudges any of the time
spent in the preparation for life, so
long as it is actually making ready.
The value of college training of to
day cannot be too strongly em
phasized. You cannot save time
nor money by omitting it, what
ever the profession on which you
enter. The college is becoming a
part of life. There was a time
when the college education did not
seem to disclose the secret of power,
and the man of affairs would have
none of it.
The American university is de
veloping its own essential idea, â€”
that of personal effectiveness. The
American university of today seeks
neither culture nor erudition as its
final end. It will value culture and
treasure erudition, but it will use
both as helps toward doing things.
It will find its inspiration in the
needs of the world as it is, and it is
through such effort that the world
that is to be shall be made a real
ity.
Besides a college education the
Twentieth Century will demand the
best special training which its best
universities can give. It will create
its own, and the young man who
does the century's work will be a
product of its university system.
The training for strenuous life is
not in academic idleness. The
blaso, lukewarm, fin-de-siecle young
man of the clubs will not represent
university culture, nor on the other
hand will culture be dominated by
a cheap utilitarianism.
The age will demand steady
headed men, men whose feet stand
on the ground, men who can see
things as they really are and act ac
cordingly. Not in air-built Utopias,
but in flesh and blood, wood and
stone and iron, will the movement
of humanity find its realization.
The man who is successful will
have but one dream, and that will
work itself out as a purpose. The
man of purpose says no to all lesser
calls, all minor opportunities.
He does not abandon his college
education because a hundred dol
lar position is offered him outside.
He does not turn from one profes

sion because there is money in an
other. He has his claim staked
out, and with time he will only fill
in the detail of its boundaries.
The Twentieth Century will ask
for men of instant decision, â€”men
whose mental equipment is all in
order, ready to be used on the in
stant. Yes and no, right and wrong,
we must have them labelled and
ready to pack to go anywhere to do
anything at any time, or to know
why we refuse to do it if it is some
thing we will not do.
The man of the Twentieth Cent
ury will be a hopeful man. He
will love the world and the world
will love him. He will be a loyal
man, considering always the best
interests of him he serves, ready to
lay down his life, if need be, for
duty, ready to abandon whatever
conflicts with higher loyalty, with
higher duty.
In the labor struggles of today
there are two huge mistakes which
may in time undo whatever of good
the labor unions may accomplish.
One of these is the struggle against
education, the effort to limit the
number of skilled laborers. The
other is the effort to destroy the
feeling of personal loyalty on the
part of the laborer. Half the value
of any man's service lies in his
willingness, his devotion to the
man or the work. This old fash
ioned virtue of loyalty must not be
cheapened. The man whose ser
vice is worth paying for gives more
than his labor. In the long run
the laborer can get no more than
he deserves, and disloyal labor is
paving the way for its own sudju
gation. Unwil ling service is a form
of slavery, and unwilling employ
ment is a slavery of the employer.
The man of the Twentieth Century
needs must be a man of character.
It was said of Abraham Lincoln
that he was a man "too simply
great to scheme for his proper self."
The man who schemes for his own
advancement soon forfeits the sup
port of others. A man need take
no heed for his own particular fut
ure. He will find his place in the
fnture of his work.
In the ordinary business of life,
the smart man has had his day.
He gives place to the man who can
bring about results. Whatever the
present menace of trusts and mo
nopoly, the business of the future
must be conducted on large lines.-
The profits of the future willbe the
legitimate reward of economy, or
ganization, and boldness of concep
tion. To this end, absolute honesty
is essential to success. Business
of a large scale must finally de
mand publicity and equity. Sooner
or later even monopolies must
grant this, whether we insist on it
by statute or not.
Above all, because including all,
the century will ask for men of
sober mind. The finest piece of
mechanism in all the universe is
the brain of man and the mitid
which is its manifestation. What
mind is, or how it is related to
brain cells we cannot say, but this
we know, that as the brain is, so is
the mind; whatever injury comes
to the one is shown in the other.
In this complex structure, with its
millions of connecting cells, we are
able to form images of the external
world, truthful as far as they go, to
retain these images, to compare
them, to infer relations of cause
and effect, to induce thought from
sensation and to translate thought
into action. In proportion to the
exactness of these operations is the
soundness, the effectiveness of the
man. The man is the mind, and
everything else is accessory. The.
sober man is the one who protects
his brain from all that would do it
harm. Ileal happiness does not
come through vice. You will know
that which is genuine because it
makes room for more happiness.
The pleasures of vice are mere illu
sionsâ€” tricks of the nervous system,
and each time these tricks are
played it is more and more difficult
for the mind to tell the truth. A
physical vice becomes a moral vice,
and all vice leaves its record on the
nervous system. To cultivate viceis
to render the actual machinery of
our mind incapableof normal action.
In our colleges, the one ethical
principle kept before the athlete by J
his associates is this: Never break
training rules. Some day we shall
realize that the game of life is more
than the game of football. We
have work every day more intricate
than pitching curves, more stren-1
uous than punting the ball. We
must keep in trim for it. We must
remember training rules. When
this is done, we shall win not only
games and races, but the great
prizes of life. Half the strength of
the men of America is now wasted
in dissipation, gross or petty, in
drink or smoke.
If it were ever my fortune in
speaking to young men to become
eloquent, with the only genuine
eloquence there is, the plain speak
ing of a living truth, this I would
say: Your first duty in life is toward
your after-self. So live that your
after-self, the man you ought to be,
may in his time be possible and
actual. Far away in the twenties,
the thiities of the Twentieth Cen
tury, he is awaiting his time. His
body, his brain, his soul are in
vour boyish hands. He cannot
help himself. What will you leave
for him? Will it be a brain
unspoiled by lust or dissipation, a
mind trained to think and act, a
nervous system true as a dial in its
response to the truth about us?
Will you, boy of the Twentieth
Century, let him come as a man
among men in his time? Or will
you throw away his patrimony?
Will you turn over to him a brain
distorted, a mind diseased, a will
untrained to action, a spinal cord
grown through and through with
the devil-grass of that vile harvest
we call wild oats?
This is your problem in life, the
problem of more importance to you
than any or all others. How will
you solve it? Will you meet it as
a man or as a fool? When you
answer this, we shall know what
use the Twentieth Century can
make of you.
"Death is a thing cleaner than
vice," Owen Wister tells us, and in
the long run it is more profitable.
Charles 11. Brown tells us of the old
physician showing the physical
effects of vice in the Museum of
Pathology. This is what he said:
"Almighty God writes a very plain
hand." In every failure as in
every success in the Twentieth Cen
tury, this plain hand can be plainly
traced.
Those who control the spiritual
thought of the Twentieth Century
will be religious men. They will
not be religious in the fashion of
monks, ascetics, mystic dreamers,
or emotional enthusiasts. They
will not be active in debating
societies, discussing the intricacies
of creeds. Neither will they be

sticklers as to details in religious
millinery. They will be simple,
earnest, God-fearing, because they
have known the God that makes for
righteousness. Their religion of
the Twentieth Century will he its
working theory of life. It will be
expressed in simple terms or it may
not he expressed at all, but it will be
deepgraven in the heart. In wiseand
helpful life it will find ample justi
fication. It will deal with the
world as it is in the service of "the
God of things as they are." It will
find this world not "a vale of tears,''
a sink of iniquity, but a working
paradise in which the rewards
of right-doing are instant and
constant. It will find indeed that
"His service is perfect freedom,"for !
all things large or small within the
reach of human effort are done in
His way and His way only.
"Glad did I live and gladly die
Anil I lay me down with a will."
This was Stevenson's word. "Let
God do his work; we will see to
ours." And in whatever part of
God's kingdom we men of the
Twentieth Century may find our
selves, we shall know that we are
at home. For the same hand that
made the world and the ages,
created also the men in whose
hands the final outcome of the
wayward centuries finds its place
within the Kingdom of Heaven.
It is the purpose of this Univer
sity to develop a certain ideal type
of man. This we cull for our con
venience "the Stanford man." In so
far as we are successful this man
will have a good many of the vir
tues of character ; but we do not
mean to claim a monopoly of
them. A good Harvard man, a
good Yale man, a good Cornell
man, a good Oxford man, any of
these would make a good Stanford
man. A good fellow in the noble
sense is a good fellow anywhere.
The good university man has cul
ture, character, scholarship, gentle
breeding, and perseverenee. All
these we can count on in some
fair degree in all real university
circles. But within the range of
all this we are trying at Stanford
to do one thing more. What this
is we hope that your own lives as
graduates and those of the fifteen
hundred alumni who have preceded
you may well exemplify.
We have tried to make you men

in the twentieth century that you
live, in the twentieth century that
you are to work, and for the twen
tieth century you have had your
training. It is for the work of the
twentieth century that you go out
today as Stanford men and wo
men.
The new century has come upon
us with a rush of energy that no
century has shown before. Let us
stand aside for a moment that we
may see what kind of a century it
is to he, what is the work it has to
do, and what manner of men it will

Compared with the centuries that
are past, the Twentieth Century in
its broad outlines will be like the

careless, devoted, fatuous, efficient.
Hut time of its traits must stand

a higher degree than any other

So in this strenuous and complex
age, this age of "fierce democracy,"
what have we to do, and with
what manner of men shall we
work? Young men of the Twen
tieth Century, will your limes find
place for you? There is plenty to
do in every direction. In agricul
ture a whole great empire is yet to
he won in the arid West; and the
West that is not arid and the East
that was never so, must he turned
into one vast market-garden. The
Twentieth Century will treat a farm
as a friend and it will yield rich
returns for such friendship. In the
Twentieth Century vast regions will
he fitted to civilization, not by im
perialism, which blasts, but by
permeation, which reclaims.
There is need of men in forestry;
for we must win hack the trees we
have slain with such ruthless hand.
Every man who masters what is al
ready known in any one branch of
applied science, makes his own for
tune. Me who can add a little,
save a little, do something better or
something cheaper, makes the for
tune of a hundred others. "There
is always room for a man of force,
and he makes room for many."
There iB no limit to the demands
of engineering. Sunshine and fall
ing water can be tramsmuted into
power. This power already lights
the cities of California, and some
day it may be changed into the heat
which moves a thousand factories.
From end to end of the continent
the Twentieth Century will bring
gold to light, and the mining engi
neer who knows the mountains best
finds his fortune ready to his hand.
Whoever knows how to manage
things or men, finds an eager wel
come. There are never too many
of those who know how; but the
day of the rule of thumb has long
since passed. The engineer of to
day must create, not imitate. And
to him who can create,'this last cen
tury we call the Twentieth, is yet
part of the first day of Creation.
In commerce, the field is always
open for young men. The world's
trade is barely yet begun. We
hear people whining over the spread
of the commercial spirit, but what
they mean is not the spirit of com
merce. Through commerce grows
tolerance, and through tolerance,
peace and solidarity. Freedom
breeds commerce as commerce de
mands freedom. When China is a
nation, her people will be no longer
a "yellow peril."
There are ten vessels today pass
ing in and out of the Golden Gate
to one in 1880. Another twenty
five years will see a hundred times
as many. We have discovered the
orient, â€”and even more, the orient
has discovered us. We may not
rule it by force of arms; for that
counts nothing in trade or civiliza
tion. Commerce follows the flag
only when it Hies on merchant
ships. Commerce follows fair play
anil mutual service. The centuries
of war have only played at com
merce. The Twentieth Century will
take it seriously,and it will call for
men to do its work. It will call
more loudly than war has ever
done, but it will ask its men not to
die bravely, but to live wisely, and
above all, truthfully, to watch their
accounts.
The reward of pure science will
be, in the future as in the past, of
its own kind, not fame nor money,
but the joy of knowing. To the
student of nature, money means
only the power to do more or better
work.
Most of the books the Twentieth
Century will print will not be lit
erature, for idle books are written
for idle people, and many idle peo
ple are left over from less insistent
times. The literature of form is
giving way already to the literature
of power. We care less and less
for the surprises and scintillations
of clever fellows; we care more and
more for the real thoughts of real
men. We find that the deepest
thoughts can be expressed in the
simplest language.
In medicine, the field of action
is growing infinitely broader, now
that its training is securely based
on science, and the divining rod no
longer stands first among its im
plements of precision. There is
room for no more doctors whose
highest conception is to look wise,
take chances, and pocket the fee;
room for no more doctors, now when
the doctor must be an honest man,
with a sound knowledge of the hu
man body and a mastery of the
methods of the sciences on which
this knowledge depends.
What is true of medicine applies
also to the profession of law. The"
law is not a device for getting
around the statutes. It is the
science and art of equity. The
lawyers of the future will not be
u ere pleaders before juries; they
will save their client* from need of
judge or jury.
In politics, the demand for ser
ious service must grow. We shall
demand not only men who can
lead in action, but men who can
prevent unwise action. Often the
policy which seems most attractive
to the majority, is full of danger
for the future. We need men who
can face popular opinion, and if
need be, to face it down.
As we look at it in the rough, the
political outlook of democracy of
ten seems discouraging. A great,
rich, busy nation cannot stop to see
who grabs its pennies. We are
plundered by the rich, we are rob
bed by the poor, and trusts and un
ions play the tyrant over both.
But all these evils are temporary.
The men that have solved greater
problems in the past will not he
balked by these.
In all this, the journalist of the
future may find an honorable place,
lie will learn to temper enterprise
with justice, audacity with fidelity,
omniscience with truthfulness. To
mould public opinion, to furnish a
truthful picture of the times from
day to day, either of these ideals
in journalism gives ample room for
the play of the highest manly en
ergy.
It is said that the teacher's nob
lest work is to lead the child to his
inheritance. This is the inheritance
he would win; the truth that men
have tested in the past, and the
means by which they were led to
know that it was truth. "Free
should the scholar be, â€”free and
brave."
The religion of this century will
be more practical, more real. It
will deal with the days of the week
as well as with the Sabbath. It
will be as patent in the marts of
trade as in the walls of a cathedral,
for a man's religion is his working
hypothesis of life, not of life in
some future world, but of life light
here today, the only day we have
in which to build a life. The world
of today will be a world of
and color and joy, a world in which
each of us may have a noble, though

humble, part. It will find religion
in love and wisdom and virtue.
It is the loyalty to duty, the love
of God through the love of men,
which may transform the workshop
to a cathedral.
What sort of men does the cent
ury need for all this work it has to
do? We may be sure that it will
choose its own, and those who can
not serve it, will be cast aside un
pitying. Those it can use, it will
pay generously, each after its kind,
some with money, some with fame,
some with the sense of power, some
with the joy of service. Some will
work hard in spite of vast wealth,
some only after taking the vow of
poverty.
Those not needed you can find
any day. They lean against lamp
posts in platoons, they crowd the
saloons, they stand about railway
stations all day long to see trains
go by. They dally on the lounges
of fashionable clubs. They may
be had tied in bundles by the
employers of menial labor. You
whom the century wants must be
the spirit of the times, strenuous,
complex, democratic.
A young man is a mighty reser
voir of unused power. Men of
training the century must demand.
It is impossible to drop into great
ness. It is as easy to do great
things as small, if you only know
how. The only way to learn to do
great things is to do small things
well, patiently, loyally. No wise
man begrudges any of the time
spent in the preparation for life, so
long as it is actually making ready.
The value of college training of to
day cannot be too strongly em
phasized. You cannot save time
nor money by omitting it, what
ever the profession on which you
enter. The college is becoming a
part of life. There was a time
when the college education did not
seem to disclose the secret of power,
and the man of affairs would have
none of it.
The American university is de
veloping its own essential idea, â€”
that of personal effectiveness. The
American university of today seeks
neither culture nor erudition as its
final end. It will value culture and
treasure erudition, but it will use
both as helps toward doing things.
It will find its inspiration in the
needs of the world as it is, and it is
through such effort that the world
that is to be shall be made a real
ity.
Besides a college education the
Twentieth Century will demand the
best special training which its best
universities can give. It will create
its own, and the young man who
does the century's work will be a
product of its university system.
The training for strenuous life is
not in academic idleness. The
blaso, lukewarm, fin-de-siecle young
man of the clubs will not represent
university culture, nor on the other
hand will culture be dominated by
a cheap utilitarianism.
The age will demand steady
headed men, men whose feet stand
on the ground, men who can see
things as they really are and act ac
cordingly. Not in air-built Utopias,
but in flesh and blood, wood and
stone and iron, will the movement
of humanity find its realization.
The man who is successful will
have but one dream, and that will
work itself out as a purpose. The
man of purpose says no to all lesser
calls, all minor opportunities.
He does not abandon his college
education because a hundred dol
lar position is offered him outside.
He does not turn from one profes

sion because there is money in an
other. He has his claim staked
out, and with time he will only fill
in the detail of its boundaries.
The Twentieth Century will ask
for men of instant decision, â€”men
whose mental equipment is all in
order, ready to be used on the in
stant. Yes and no, right and wrong,
we must have them labelled and
ready to pack to go anywhere to do
anything at any time, or to know
why we refuse to do it if it is some
thing we will not do.
The man of the Twentieth Cent
ury will be a hopeful man. He
will love the world and the world
will love him. He will be a loyal
man, considering always the best
interests of him he serves, ready to
lay down his life, if need be, for
duty, ready to abandon whatever
conflicts with higher loyalty, with
higher duty.
In the labor struggles of today
there are two huge mistakes which
may in time undo whatever of good
the labor unions may accomplish.
One of these is the struggle against
education, the effort to limit the
number of skilled laborers. The
other is the effort to destroy the
feeling of personal loyalty on the
part of the laborer. Half the value
of any man's service lies in his
willingness, his devotion to the
man or the work. This old fash
ioned virtue of loyalty must not be
cheapened. The man whose ser
vice is worth paying for gives more
than his labor. In the long run
the laborer can get no more than
he deserves, and disloyal labor is
paving the way for its own sudju
gation. Unwil ling service is a form
of slavery, and unwilling employ
ment is a slavery of the employer.
The man of the Twentieth Century
needs must be a man of character.
It was said of Abraham Lincoln
that he was a man "too simply
great to scheme for his proper self."
The man who schemes for his own
advancement soon forfeits the sup
port of others. A man need take
no heed for his own particular fut
ure. He will find his place in the
fnture of his work.
In the ordinary business of life,
the smart man has had his day.
He gives place to the man who can
bring about results. Whatever the
present menace of trusts and mo
nopoly, the business of the future
must be conducted on large lines.-
The profits of the future willbe the
legitimate reward of economy, or
ganization, and boldness of concep
tion. To this end, absolute honesty
is essential to success. Business
of a large scale must finally de
mand publicity and equity. Sooner
or later even monopolies must
grant this, whether we insist on it
by statute or not.
Above all, because including all,
the century will ask for men of
sober mind. The finest piece of
mechanism in all the universe is
the brain of man and the mitid
which is its manifestation. What
mind is, or how it is related to
brain cells we cannot say, but this
we know, that as the brain is, so is
the mind; whatever injury comes
to the one is shown in the other.
In this complex structure, with its
millions of connecting cells, we are
able to form images of the external
world, truthful as far as they go, to
retain these images, to compare
them, to infer relations of cause
and effect, to induce thought from
sensation and to translate thought
into action. In proportion to the
exactness of these operations is the
soundness, the effectiveness of the
man. The man is the mind, and
everything else is accessory. The.
sober man is the one who protects
his brain from all that would do it
harm. Ileal happiness does not
come through vice. You will know
that which is genuine because it
makes room for more happiness.
The pleasures of vice are mere illu
sionsâ€” tricks of the nervous system,
and each time these tricks are
played it is more and more difficult
for the mind to tell the truth. A
physical vice becomes a moral vice,
and all vice leaves its record on the
nervous system. To cultivate viceis
to render the actual machinery of
our mind incapableof normal action.
In our colleges, the one ethical
principle kept before the athlete by J
his associates is this: Never break
training rules. Some day we shall
realize that the game of life is more
than the game of football. We
have work every day more intricate
than pitching curves, more stren-1
uous than punting the ball. We
must keep in trim for it. We must
remember training rules. When
this is done, we shall win not only
games and races, but the great
prizes of life. Half the strength of
the men of America is now wasted
in dissipation, gross or petty, in
drink or smoke.
If it were ever my fortune in
speaking to young men to become
eloquent, with the only genuine
eloquence there is, the plain speak
ing of a living truth, this I would
say: Your first duty in life is toward
your after-self. So live that your
after-self, the man you ought to be,
may in his time be possible and
actual. Far away in the twenties,
the thiities of the Twentieth Cen
tury, he is awaiting his time. His
body, his brain, his soul are in
vour boyish hands. He cannot
help himself. What will you leave
for him? Will it be a brain
unspoiled by lust or dissipation, a
mind trained to think and act, a
nervous system true as a dial in its
response to the truth about us?
Will you, boy of the Twentieth
Century, let him come as a man
among men in his time? Or will
you throw away his patrimony?
Will you turn over to him a brain
distorted, a mind diseased, a will
untrained to action, a spinal cord
grown through and through with
the devil-grass of that vile harvest
we call wild oats?
This is your problem in life, the
problem of more importance to you
than any or all others. How will
you solve it? Will you meet it as
a man or as a fool? When you
answer this, we shall know what
use the Twentieth Century can
make of you.
"Death is a thing cleaner than
vice," Owen Wister tells us, and in
the long run it is more profitable.
Charles 11. Brown tells us of the old
physician showing the physical
effects of vice in the Museum of
Pathology. This is what he said:
"Almighty God writes a very plain
hand." In every failure as in
every success in the Twentieth Cen
tury, this plain hand can be plainly
traced.
Those who control the spiritual
thought of the Twentieth Century
will be religious men. They will
not be religious in the fashion of
monks, ascetics, mystic dreamers,
or emotional enthusiasts. They
will not be active in debating
societies, discussing the intricacies
of creeds. Neither will they be

sticklers as to details in religious
millinery. They will be simple,
earnest, God-fearing, because they
have known the God that makes for
righteousness. Their religion of
the Twentieth Century will he its
working theory of life. It will be
expressed in simple terms or it may
not he expressed at all, but it will be
deepgraven in the heart. In wiseand
helpful life it will find ample justi
fication. It will deal with the
world as it is in the service of "the
God of things as they are." It will
find this world not "a vale of tears,''
a sink of iniquity, but a working
paradise in which the rewards
of right-doing are instant and
constant. It will find indeed that
"His service is perfect freedom,"for !
all things large or small within the
reach of human effort are done in
His way and His way only.
"Glad did I live and gladly die
Anil I lay me down with a will."
This was Stevenson's word. "Let
God do his work; we will see to
ours." And in whatever part of
God's kingdom we men of the
Twentieth Century may find our
selves, we shall know that we are
at home. For the same hand that
made the world and the ages,
created also the men in whose
hands the final outcome of the
wayward centuries finds its place
within the Kingdom of Heaven.
It is the purpose of this Univer
sity to develop a certain ideal type
of man. This we cull for our con
venience "the Stanford man." In so
far as we are successful this man
will have a good many of the vir
tues of character ; but we do not
mean to claim a monopoly of
them. A good Harvard man, a
good Yale man, a good Cornell
man, a good Oxford man, any of
these would make a good Stanford
man. A good fellow in the noble
sense is a good fellow anywhere.
The good university man has cul
ture, character, scholarship, gentle
breeding, and perseverenee. All
these we can count on in some
fair degree in all real university
circles. But within the range of
all this we are trying at Stanford
to do one thing more. What this
is we hope that your own lives as
graduates and those of the fifteen
hundred alumni who have preceded
you may well exemplify.
We have tried to make you men
and women of the times. We
have tried to fit you to respond to
the demands of the twentieth cen
tury. Your training, as your
life, has been cast not in
the thirteenth century of ca
thedral building, not in the
sixteenth century of the revolt
of the intellect, not in the eight
eenth century of constitution mak
ing, or even in the nineteenth cen
tury with its discovery of the real
ity of external things, and the
presence of God in all temples,
even those made by hands. It is
in the twentieth century that you
live, in the twentieth century that
you are to work, and for the twen
tieth century you have had your
training. It is for the work of the
twentieth century that you go out
today as Stanford men and wo
men.
The new century has come upon
us with a rush of energy that no
century has shown before. Let us
stand aside for a moment that we
may see what kind of a century it
is to he, what is the work it has to
do, and what manner of men it will
demand to do it.
In most regiirds one century is
like another. Just as men are men,
so times are times. Just as each
individual man has the same
organs, the same passions, the
same functions as all others,so it is
with all the cent uries. Not wars and
conquests mark a century. The
hosts grow small in the vanishing
perspective, "the captains and the
kings depart," but the thoughts of
men, their attitude toward their
environment, their struggles toward
duty, these are the things which
endure.
Compared with the centuries that
are past, the Twentieth Century in
its broad outlines will be like the
rest. It will be selfish, generous,
careless, devoted, fatuous, efficient.
Hut time of its traits must stand
out above all others, each raised to
a higher degree than any other
century has known. TheTwentieth
Century above all others will he
strenuous, complex and democratic.
Strenuous the century must be,
of course. This we can all see, and
we have to thank the young man of
the Twentieth Century who gave us
the watchword of "the strenuous

life" and who has raised the apt
phrase to the dignity of a national
purpose. Our century has a host
of things to do. If we are called to
help in this work, there is no time
for an idle minute. "The color of
life is red." Already the fad of the
drooping spirit, the end-of-the-cen
tury pose,Mhas given way to the
rush of the strenuous life, to the
feeling that struggle brings its own
reward. Life is repaid by the joy
of living it.
As the century is strenuous so
will it he complex. The complexity
of life is shown by the extension of
the necessity of choice. EacTt of us
has to render a decision, to say yes
or no, a hundred times when our
grandfathers were called upon a
single time. Through modern civil
ization we are coming into our
inheritance, and this heirloom in
cludes the best that any man has
done or thought since history and
literature and art began. Of one
blood are all the people of theearth,
and whatsoever is done to the least
of these little ones in some degree
comes to me. It is said that
through the bonds of commerce,
common trade and common need,
there is growing up the fund of a
great "bank of human kindness,"
no genuine draft on which is ever
left dishonored. Whoever is in
need of help the world over, by that
token has a claim on us.
In our material life we draw our
resources from every land. We
need the best work of every nation
and every nation asks our best of
us. The day of home-brewed ale,
of home-made bread and home-spun
clothing is already past with us.
With home made garments also pass
away inherited politics and hered
itary religion, with all the support
of caste and with all its barriers.
We must work all this out for our
selves; we must make our own
place in society; we must frame our
own creeds, we must live our own
religion; for no longer can one
man's religion be taken unquestion
ably by any other. With all this,
the simplicity of life is passing
away. The caravan traverses our
front yard. We speak to millions,
millions speak to us; and we must
cultivate the social tact, the gentle
ness, the adroitness, the firmness
necessary to carry out our own
designs without thwarting those of
others. Time no longer Hows on
evenly. We must he swift and
accurate in the part we play in a
drama so mighty, so strenuous and
so complex.
More than any of the others, the
Twentieth Century will be demo
cratic. The greatest discovery of
the Nineteenth Century was that
of the reality of external things.
If something needs doing, do it.
The more plainly,directly, honestly,
the better.
The earlier centuries cared little
for the life of a man. In masses
and mobs they needed kings and
rulers, but could not choose them.
The people could not follow those
they understood or who understood
them. They must trust all to the
blind chance of heredity. Not the
man who would do or think or help,
but the eldest son of a former lord
was chosen for their homage. The
result of it all was that no use

was made of the forces of nature;
for those who might have learned
to control them were hunted to
their death.
So in this strenuous and complex
age, this age of "fierce democracy,"
what have we to do, and with
what manner of men shall we
work? Young men of the Twen
tieth Century, will your limes find
place for you? There is plenty to
do in every direction. In agricul
ture a whole great empire is yet to
he won in the arid West; and the
West that is not arid and the East
that was never so, must he turned
into one vast market-garden. The
Twentieth Century will treat a farm
as a friend and it will yield rich
returns for such friendship. In the
Twentieth Century vast regions will
he fitted to civilization, not by im
perialism, which blasts, but by
permeation, which reclaims.
There is need of men in forestry;
for we must win hack the trees we
have slain with such ruthless hand.

save a little, do something better or
something cheaper, makes the for

There iB no limit to the demands

ing water can be tramsmuted into
power. This power already lights
the cities of California, and some
day it may be changed into the heat
which moves a thousand factories.
From end to end of the continent
the Twentieth Century will bring
gold to light, and the mining engi
neer who knows the mountains best

Whoever knows how to manage

of those who know how; but the

In medicine, the field of action
is growing infinitely broader, now
that its training is securely based

longer stands first among its im
plements of precision. There is

of God through the love of men,
which may transform the workshop
to a cathedral.
What sort of men does the cent
ury need for all this work it has to
do? We may be sure that it will
choose its own, and those who can
not serve it, will be cast aside un
pitying. Those it can use, it will
pay generously, each after its kind,
some with money, some with fame,
some with the sense of power, some
with the joy of service. Some will
work hard in spite of vast wealth,
some only after taking the vow of
poverty.
Those not needed you can find
any day. They lean against lamp
posts in platoons, they crowd the
saloons, they stand about railway
stations all day long to see trains
go by. They dally on the lounges
of fashionable clubs. They may
be had tied in bundles by the
employers of menial labor. You
whom the century wants must be
the spirit of the times, strenuous,
complex, democratic.
A young man is a mighty reser
voir of unused power. Men of
training the century must demand.
It is impossible to drop into great
ness. It is as easy to do great
things as small, if you only know
how. The only way to learn to do
great things is to do small things
well, patiently, loyally. No wise
man begrudges any of the time
spent in the preparation for life, so
long as it is actually making ready.
The value of college training of to
day cannot be too strongly em
phasized. You cannot save time
nor money by omitting it, what
ever the profession on which you
enter. The college is becoming a
part of life. There was a time
when the college education did not
seem to disclose the secret of power,
and the man of affairs would have
none of it.
The American university is de
veloping its own essential idea, â€”
that of personal effectiveness. The
American university of today seeks
neither culture nor erudition as its
final end. It will value culture and
treasure erudition, but it will use
both as helps toward doing things.
It will find its inspiration in the
needs of the world as it is, and it is
through such effort that the world
that is to be shall be made a real
ity.
Besides a college education the
Twentieth Century will demand the
best special training which its best
universities can give. It will create
its own, and the young man who
does the century's work will be a
product of its university system.
The training for strenuous life is
not in academic idleness. The
blaso, lukewarm, fin-de-siecle young
man of the clubs will not represent
university culture, nor on the other
hand will culture be dominated by
a cheap utilitarianism.
The age will demand steady
headed men, men whose feet stand
on the ground, men who can see
things as they really are and act ac
cordingly. Not in air-built Utopias,
but in flesh and blood, wood and
stone and iron, will the movement
of humanity find its realization.
The man who is successful will
have but one dream, and that will
work itself out as a purpose. The
man of purpose says no to all lesser
calls, all minor opportunities.
He does not abandon his college
education because a hundred dol
lar position is offered him outside.
He does not turn from one profes

sion because there is money in an
other. He has his claim staked
out, and with time he will only fill
in the detail of its boundaries.
The Twentieth Century will ask
for men of instant decision, â€”men
whose mental equipment is all in
order, ready to be used on the in
stant. Yes and no, right and wrong,
we must have them labelled and
ready to pack to go anywhere to do
anything at any time, or to know
why we refuse to do it if it is some
thing we will not do.
The man of the Twentieth Cent
ury will be a hopeful man. He
will love the world and the world
will love him. He will be a loyal
man, considering always the best
interests of him he serves, ready to
lay down his life, if need be, for
duty, ready to abandon whatever
conflicts with higher loyalty, with
higher duty.
In the labor struggles of today
there are two huge mistakes which
may in time undo whatever of good
the labor unions may accomplish.
One of these is the struggle against
education, the effort to limit the
number of skilled laborers. The
other is the effort to destroy the
feeling of personal loyalty on the
part of the laborer. Half the value
of any man's service lies in his
willingness, his devotion to the
man or the work. This old fash
ioned virtue of loyalty must not be
cheapened. The man whose ser
vice is worth paying for gives more
than his labor. In the long run
the laborer can get no more than
he deserves, and disloyal labor is
paving the way for its own sudju
gation. Unwil ling service is a form
of slavery, and unwilling employ
ment is a slavery of the employer.
The man of the Twentieth Century
needs must be a man of character.
It was said of Abraham Lincoln
that he was a man "too simply
great to scheme for his proper self."
The man who schemes for his own
advancement soon forfeits the sup
port of others. A man need take
no heed for his own particular fut
ure. He will find his place in the
fnture of his work.
In the ordinary business of life,
the smart man has had his day.
He gives place to the man who can
bring about results. Whatever the
present menace of trusts and mo
nopoly, the business of the future
must be conducted on large lines.-
The profits of the future willbe the
legitimate reward of economy, or
ganization, and boldness of concep
tion. To this end, absolute honesty
is essential to success. Business
of a large scale must finally de
mand publicity and equity. Sooner
or later even monopolies must
grant this, whether we insist on it
by statute or not.
Above all, because including all,
the century will ask for men of
sober mind. The finest piece of
mechanism in all the universe is
the brain of man and the mitid
which is its manifestation. What
mind is, or how it is related to
brain cells we cannot say, but this
we know, that as the brain is, so is
the mind; whatever injury comes
to the one is shown in the other.
In this complex structure, with its
millions of connecting cells, we are
able to form images of the external
world, truthful as far as they go, to
retain these images, to compare
them, to infer relations of cause
and effect, to induce thought from
sensation and to translate thought
into action. In proportion to the
exactness of these operations is the
soundness, the effectiveness of the
man. The man is the mind, and
everything else is accessory. The.
sober man is the one who protects
his brain from all that would do it
harm. Ileal happiness does not
come through vice. You will know
that which is genuine because it
makes room for more happiness.
The pleasures of vice are mere illu
sionsâ€” tricks of the nervous system,
and each time these tricks are
played it is more and more difficult
for the mind to tell the truth. A
physical vice becomes a moral vice,
and all vice leaves its record on the
nervous system. To cultivate viceis
to render the actual machinery of
our mind incapableof normal action.
In our colleges, the one ethical
principle kept before the athlete by J
his associates is this: Never break
training rules. Some day we shall
realize that the game of life is more
than the game of football. We
have work every day more intricate
than pitching curves, more stren-1
uous than punting the ball. We
must keep in trim for it. We must
remember training rules. When
this is done, we shall win not only
games and races, but the great
prizes of life. Half the strength of
the men of America is now wasted
in dissipation, gross or petty, in
drink or smoke.
If it were ever my fortune in
speaking to young men to become
eloquent, with the only genuine
eloquence there is, the plain speak
ing of a living truth, this I would
say: Your first duty in life is toward
your after-self. So live that your
after-self, the man you ought to be,
may in his time be possible and
actual. Far away in the twenties,
the thiities of the Twentieth Cen
tury, he is awaiting his time. His
body, his brain, his soul are in
vour boyish hands. He cannot
help himself. What will you leave
for him? Will it be a brain
unspoiled by lust or dissipation, a
mind trained to think and act, a
nervous system true as a dial in its
response to the truth about us?
Will you, boy of the Twentieth
Century, let him come as a man
among men in his time? Or will
you throw away his patrimony?
Will you turn over to him a brain
distorted, a mind diseased, a will
untrained to action, a spinal cord
grown through and through with
the devil-grass of that vile harvest
we call wild oats?
This is your problem in life, the
problem of more importance to you
than any or all others. How will
you solve it? Will you meet it as
a man or as a fool? When you
answer this, we shall know what
use the Twentieth Century can
make of you.
"Death is a thing cleaner than
vice," Owen Wister tells us, and in
the long run it is more profitable.
Charles 11. Brown tells us of the old
physician showing the physical
effects of vice in the Museum of
Pathology. This is what he said:
"Almighty God writes a very plain
hand." In every failure as in
every success in the Twentieth Cen
tury, this plain hand can be plainly
traced.
Those who control the spiritual
thought of the Twentieth Century
will be religious men. They will
not be religious in the fashion of
monks, ascetics, mystic dreamers,
or emotional enthusiasts. They
will not be active in debating
societies, discussing the intricacies
of creeds. Neither will they be

sticklers as to details in religious
millinery. They will be simple,
earnest, God-fearing, because they
have known the God that makes for
righteousness. Their religion of
the Twentieth Century will he its
working theory of life. It will be
expressed in simple terms or it may
not he expressed at all, but it will be
deepgraven in the heart. In wiseand
helpful life it will find ample justi
fication. It will deal with the
world as it is in the service of "the
God of things as they are." It will
find this world not "a vale of tears,''
a sink of iniquity, but a working
paradise in which the rewards
of right-doing are instant and
constant. It will find indeed that
"His service is perfect freedom,"for !
all things large or small within the
reach of human effort are done in
His way and His way only.
"Glad did I live and gladly die
Anil I lay me down with a will."
This was Stevenson's word. "Let
God do his work; we will see to
ours." And in whatever part of
God's kingdom we men of the
Twentieth Century may find our
selves, we shall know that we are
at home. For the same hand that
made the world and the ages,
created also the men in whose
hands the final outcome of the
wayward centuries finds its place
within the Kingdom of Heaven.
It is the purpose of this Univer
sity to develop a certain ideal type
of man. This we cull for our con
venience "the Stanford man." In so
far as we are successful this man
will have a good many of the vir
tues of character ; but we do not
mean to claim a monopoly of
them. A good Harvard man, a
good Yale man, a good Cornell
man, a good Oxford man, any of
these would make a good Stanford
man. A good fellow in the noble
sense is a good fellow anywhere.
The good university man has cul
ture, character, scholarship, gentle
breeding, and perseverenee. All
these we can count on in some
fair degree in all real university
circles. But within the range of
all this we are trying at Stanford
to do one thing more. What this
is we hope that your own lives as
graduates and those of the fifteen
hundred alumni who have preceded
you may well exemplify.
We have tried to make you men
and women of the times. We
have tried to fit you to respond to
the demands of the twentieth cen
tury. Your training, as your
life, has been cast not in
the thirteenth century of ca
thedral building, not in the
sixteenth century of the revolt
of the intellect, not in the eight
eenth century of constitution mak
ing, or even in the nineteenth cen
tury with its discovery of the real
ity of external things, and the
presence of God in all temples,
even those made by hands. It is
in the twentieth century that you
live, in the twentieth century that
you are to work, and for the twen
tieth century you have had your
training. It is for the work of the
twentieth century that you go out
today as Stanford men and wo
men.
The new century has come upon
us with a rush of energy that no
century has shown before. Let us
stand aside for a moment that we
may see what kind of a century it
is to he, what is the work it has to
do, and what manner of men it will
demand to do it.
In most regiirds one century is
like another. Just as men are men,
so times are times. Just as each
individual man has the same
organs, the same passions, the
same functions as all others,so it is
with all the cent uries. Not wars and
conquests mark a century. The
hosts grow small in the vanishing
perspective, "the captains and the
kings depart," but the thoughts of
men, their attitude toward their
environment, their struggles toward
duty, these are the things which
endure.
Compared with the centuries that
are past, the Twentieth Century in
its broad outlines will be like the
rest. It will be selfish, generous,
careless, devoted, fatuous, efficient.
Hut time of its traits must stand
out above all others, each raised to
a higher degree than any other
century has known. TheTwentieth
Century above all others will he
strenuous, complex and democratic.
Strenuous the century must be,
of course. This we can all see, and
we have to thank the young man of
the Twentieth Century who gave us
the watchword of "the strenuous

life" and who has raised the apt
phrase to the dignity of a national
purpose. Our century has a host
of things to do. If we are called to
help in this work, there is no time
for an idle minute. "The color of
life is red." Already the fad of the
drooping spirit, the end-of-the-cen
tury pose,Mhas given way to the
rush of the strenuous life, to the
feeling that struggle brings its own
reward. Life is repaid by the joy
of living it.
As the century is strenuous so
will it he complex. The complexity
of life is shown by the extension of
the necessity of choice. EacTt of us
has to render a decision, to say yes
or no, a hundred times when our
grandfathers were called upon a
single time. Through modern civil
ization we are coming into our
inheritance, and this heirloom in
cludes the best that any man has
done or thought since history and
literature and art began. Of one
blood are all the people of theearth,
and whatsoever is done to the least
of these little ones in some degree
comes to me. It is said that
through the bonds of commerce,
common trade and common need,
there is growing up the fund of a
great "bank of human kindness,"
no genuine draft on which is ever
left dishonored. Whoever is in
need of help the world over, by that
token has a claim on us.
In our material life we draw our
resources from every land. We
need the best work of every nation
and every nation asks our best of
us. The day of home-brewed ale,
of home-made bread and home-spun
clothing is already past with us.
With home made garments also pass
away inherited politics and hered
itary religion, with all the support
of caste and with all its barriers.
We must work all this out for our
selves; we must make our own
place in society; we must frame our
own creeds, we must live our own
religion; for no longer can one
man's religion be taken unquestion
ably by any other. With all this,
the simplicity of life is passing
away. The caravan traverses our
front yard. We speak to millions,
millions speak to us; and we must
cultivate the social tact, the gentle
ness, the adroitness, the firmness
necessary to carry out our own
designs without thwarting those of
others. Time no longer Hows on
evenly. We must he swift and
accurate in the part we play in a
drama so mighty, so strenuous and
so complex.
More than any of the others, the
Twentieth Century will be demo
cratic. The greatest discovery of
the Nineteenth Century was that
of the reality of external things.
If something needs doing, do it.
The more plainly,directly, honestly,
the better.
The earlier centuries cared little
for the life of a man. In masses
and mobs they needed kings and
rulers, but could not choose them.
The people could not follow those
they understood or who understood
them. They must trust all to the
blind chance of heredity. Not the
man who would do or think or help,
but the eldest son of a former lord
was chosen for their homage. The
result of it all was that no use

was made of the forces of nature;
for those who might have learned
to control them were hunted to
their death.
So in this strenuous and complex
age, this age of "fierce democracy,"
what have we to do, and with
what manner of men shall we
work? Young men of the Twen
tieth Century, will your limes find
place for you? There is plenty to
do in every direction. In agricul
ture a whole great empire is yet to
he won in the arid West; and the
West that is not arid and the East
that was never so, must he turned
into one vast market-garden. The
Twentieth Century will treat a farm
as a friend and it will yield rich
returns for such friendship. In the
Twentieth Century vast regions will
he fitted to civilization, not by im
perialism, which blasts, but by
permeation, which reclaims.
There is need of men in forestry;
for we must win hack the trees we
have slain with such ruthless hand.
Every man who masters what is al
ready known in any one branch of
applied science, makes his own for
tune. Me who can add a little,
save a little, do something better or
something cheaper, makes the for
tune of a hundred others. "There
is always room for a man of force,
and he makes room for many."
There iB no limit to the demands
of engineering. Sunshine and fall
ing water can be tramsmuted into
power. This power already lights
the cities of California, and some
day it may be changed into the heat
which moves a thousand factories.
From end to end of the continent
the Twentieth Century will bring
gold to light, and the mining engi
neer who knows the mountains best
finds his fortune ready to his hand.
Whoever knows how to manage
things or men, finds an eager wel
come. There are never too many
of those who know how; but the
day of the rule of thumb has long
since passed. The engineer of to
day must create, not imitate. And
to him who can create,'this last cen
tury we call the Twentieth, is yet
part of the first day of Creation.
In commerce, the field is always
open for young men. The world's
trade is barely yet begun. We
hear people whining over the spread
of the commercial spirit, but what
they mean is not the spirit of com
merce. Through commerce grows
tolerance, and through tolerance,
peace and solidarity. Freedom
breeds commerce as commerce de
mands freedom. When China is a
nation, her people will be no longer
a "yellow peril."
There are ten vessels today pass
ing in and out of the Golden Gate
to one in 1880. Another twenty
five years will see a hundred times
as many. We have discovered the
orient, â€”and even more, the orient
has discovered us. We may not
rule it by force of arms; for that
counts nothing in trade or civiliza
tion. Commerce follows the flag
only when it Hies on merchant
ships. Commerce follows fair play
anil mutual service. The centuries
of war have only played at com
merce. The Twentieth Century will
take it seriously,and it will call for
men to do its work. It will call
more loudly than war has ever
done, but it will ask its men not to
die bravely, but to live wisely, and
above all, truthfully, to watch their
accounts.
The reward of pure science will
be, in the future as in the past, of
its own kind, not fame nor money,
but the joy of knowing. To the
student of nature, money means
only the power to do more or better
work.
Most of the books the Twentieth
Century will print will not be lit
erature, for idle books are written
for idle people, and many idle peo
ple are left over from less insistent
times. The literature of form is
giving way already to the literature
of power. We care less and less
for the surprises and scintillations
of clever fellows; we care more and
more for the real thoughts of real
men. We find that the deepest
thoughts can be expressed in the
simplest language.
In medicine, the field of action
is growing infinitely broader, now
that its training is securely based
on science, and the divining rod no
longer stands first among its im
plements of precision. There is
room for no more doctors whose
highest conception is to look wise,
take chances, and pocket the fee;
room for no more doctors, now when
the doctor must be an honest man,
with a sound knowledge of the hu
man body and a mastery of the
methods of the sciences on which
this knowledge depends.
What is true of medicine applies
also to the profession of law. The"
law is not a device for getting
around the statutes. It is the
science and art of equity. The
lawyers of the future will not be
u ere pleaders before juries; they
will save their client* from need of
judge or jury.
In politics, the demand for ser
ious service must grow. We shall
demand not only men who can
lead in action, but men who can
prevent unwise action. Often the
policy which seems most attractive
to the majority, is full of danger
for the future. We need men who
can face popular opinion, and if
need be, to face it down.
As we look at it in the rough, the
political outlook of democracy of
ten seems discouraging. A great,
rich, busy nation cannot stop to see
who grabs its pennies. We are
plundered by the rich, we are rob
bed by the poor, and trusts and un
ions play the tyrant over both.
But all these evils are temporary.
The men that have solved greater
problems in the past will not he
balked by these.
In all this, the journalist of the
future may find an honorable place,
lie will learn to temper enterprise
with justice, audacity with fidelity,
omniscience with truthfulness. To
mould public opinion, to furnish a
truthful picture of the times from
day to day, either of these ideals
in journalism gives ample room for
the play of the highest manly en
ergy.
It is said that the teacher's nob
lest work is to lead the child to his
inheritance. This is the inheritance
he would win; the truth that men
have tested in the past, and the
means by which they were led to
know that it was truth. "Free
should the scholar be, â€”free and
brave."
The religion of this century will
be more practical, more real. It
will deal with the days of the week
as well as with the Sabbath. It
will be as patent in the marts of
trade as in the walls of a cathedral,
for a man's religion is his working
hypothesis of life, not of life in
some future world, but of life light
here today, the only day we have
in which to build a life. The world
of today will be a world of
and color and joy, a world in which
each of us may have a noble, though

humble, part. It will find religion
in love and wisdom and virtue.
It is the loyalty to duty, the love
of God through the love of men,
which may transform the workshop
to a cathedral.
What sort of men does the cent
ury need for all this work it has to
do? We may be sure that it will
choose its own, and those who can
not serve it, will be cast aside un
pitying. Those it can use, it will
pay generously, each after its kind,
some with money, some with fame,
some with the sense of power, some
with the joy of service. Some will
work hard in spite of vast wealth,
some only after taking the vow of
poverty.
Those not needed you can find
any day. They lean against lamp
posts in platoons, they crowd the
saloons, they stand about railway
stations all day long to see trains
go by. They dally on the lounges
of fashionable clubs. They may
be had tied in bundles by the
employers of menial labor. You
whom the century wants must be
the spirit of the times, strenuous,
complex, democratic.
A young man is a mighty reser
voir of unused power. Men of

sensation and to translate thought
into action. In proportion to the
exactness of these operations is the
soundness, the effectiveness of the
man. The man is the mind, and
everything else is accessory. The.
sober man is the one who protects
his brain from all that would do it
harm. Ileal happiness does not
come through vice. You will know
that which is genuine because it
makes room for more happiness.
The pleasures of vice are mere illu
sionsâ€” tricks of the nervous system,
and each time these tricks are
played it is more and more difficult
for the mind to tell the truth. A
physical vice becomes a moral vice,
and all vice leaves its record on the
nervous system. To cultivate viceis
to render the actual machinery of
our mind incapableof normal action.
In our colleges, the one ethical
principle kept before the athlete by J
his associates is this: Never break
training rules. Some day we shall
realize that the game of life is more
than the game of football. We
have work every day more intricate
than pitching curves, more stren-1
uous than punting the ball. We
must keep in trim for it. We must
remember training rules. When
this is done, we shall win not only
games and races, but the great
prizes of life. Half the strength of
the men of America is now wasted
in dissipation, gross or petty, in
drink or smoke.
If it were ever my fortune in
speaking to young men to become
eloquent, with the only genuine
eloquence there is, the plain speak
ing of a living truth, this I would
say: Your first duty in life is toward
your after-self. So live that your
after-self, the man you ought to be,
may in his time be possible and
actual. Far away in the twenties,
the thiities of the Twentieth Cen
tury, he is awaiting his time. His
body, his brain, his soul are in
vour boyish hands. He cannot
help himself. What will you leave
for him? Will it be a brain
unspoiled by lust or dissipation, a
mind trained to think and act, a
nervous system true as a dial in its
response to the truth about us?
Will you, boy of the Twentieth
Century, let him come as a man
among men in his time? Or will
you throw away his patrimony?
Will you turn over to him a brain
distorted, a mind diseased, a will
untrained to action, a spinal cord
grown through and through with
the devil-grass of that vile harvest
we call wild oats?
This is your problem in life, the
problem of more importance to you
than any or all others. How will
you solve it? Will you meet it as
a man or as a fool? When you
answer this, we shall know what
use the Twentieth Century can
make of you.
"Death is a thing cleaner than
vice," Owen Wister tells us, and in
the long run it is more profitable.
Charles 11. Brown tells us of the old
physician showing the physical
effects of vice in the Museum of
Pathology. This is what he said:
"Almighty God writes a very plain
hand." In every failure as in
every success in the Twentieth Cen
tury, this plain hand can be plainly
traced.
Those who control the spiritual
thought of the Twentieth Century
will be religious men. They will
not be religious in the fashion of
monks, ascetics, mystic dreamers,
or emotional enthusiasts. They
will not be active in debating
societies, discussing the intricacies
of creeds. Neither will they be

sticklers as to details in religious
millinery. They will be simple,
earnest, God-fearing, because they
have known the God that makes for
righteousness. Their religion of
the Twentieth Century will he its
working theory of life. It will be
expressed in simple terms or it may
not he expressed at all, but it will be
deepgraven in the heart. In wiseand
helpful life it will find ample justi
fication. It will deal with the
world as it is in the service of "the
God of things as they are." It will
find this world not "a vale of tears,''
a sink of iniquity, but a working
paradise in which the rewards
of right-doing are instant and
constant. It will find indeed that
"His service is perfect freedom,"for !
all things large or small within the
reach of human effort are done in
His way and His way only.
"Glad did I live and gladly die
Anil I lay me down with a will."
This was Stevenson's word. "Let
God do his work; we will see to
ours." And in whatever part of
God's kingdom we men of the
Twentieth Century may find our
selves, we shall know that we are
at home. For the same hand that
made the world and the ages,
created also the men in whose
hands the final outcome of the
wayward centuries finds its place
within the Kingdom of Heaven.
It is the purpose of this Univer
sity to develop a certain ideal type
of man. This we cull for our con
venience "the Stanford man." In so
far as we are successful this man
will have a good many of the vir
tues of character ; but we do not
mean to claim a monopoly of
them. A good Harvard man, a
good Yale man, a good Cornell
man, a good Oxford man, any of
these would make a good Stanford
man. A good fellow in the noble
sense is a good fellow anywhere.
The good university man has cul
ture, character, scholarship, gentle
breeding, and perseverenee. All
these we can count on in some
fair degree in all real university
circles. But within the range of
all this we are trying at Stanford
to do one thing more. What this
is we hope that your own lives as
graduates and those of the fifteen
hundred alumni who have preceded
you may well exemplify.
We have tried to make you men
and women of the times. We
have tried to fit you to respond to
the demands of the twentieth cen
tury. Your training, as your
life, has been cast not in
the thirteenth century of ca
thedral building, not in the
sixteenth century of the revolt
of the intellect, not in the eight
eenth century of constitution mak
ing, or even in the nineteenth cen
tury with its discovery of the real
ity of external things, and the
presence of God in all temples,
even those made by hands. It is
in the twentieth century that you
live, in the twentieth century that
you are to work, and for the twen
tieth century you have had your
training. It is for the work of the
twentieth century that you go out
today as Stanford men and wo
men.
The new century has come upon
us with a rush of energy that no
century has shown before. Let us
stand aside for a moment that we
may see what kind of a century it
is to he, what is the work it has to
do, and what manner of men it will
demand to do it.
In most regiirds one century is
like another. Just as men are men,
so times are times. Just as each
individual man has the same
organs, the same passions, the
same functions as all others,so it is
with all the cent uries. Not wars and
conquests mark a century. The
hosts grow small in the vanishing
perspective, "the captains and the
kings depart," but the thoughts of
men, their attitude toward their
environment, their struggles toward
duty, these are the things which
endure.
Compared with the centuries that
are past, the Twentieth Century in
its broad outlines will be like the
rest. It will be selfish, generous,
careless, devoted, fatuous, efficient.
Hut time of its traits must stand
out above all others, each raised to
a higher degree than any other
century has known. TheTwentieth
Century above all others will he
strenuous, complex and democratic.
Strenuous the century must be,
of course. This we can all see, and
we have to thank the young man of
the Twentieth Century who gave us
the watchword of "the strenuous

life" and who has raised the apt
phrase to the dignity of a national
purpose. Our century has a host
of things to do. If we are called to
help in this work, there is no time
for an idle minute. "The color of
life is red." Already the fad of the
drooping spirit, the end-of-the-cen
tury pose,Mhas given way to the
rush of the strenuous life, to the
feeling that struggle brings its own
reward. Life is repaid by the joy
of living it.
As the century is strenuous so
will it he complex. The complexity
of life is shown by the extension of
the necessity of choice. EacTt of us
has to render a decision, to say yes
or no, a hundred times when our
grandfathers were called upon a
single time. Through modern civil
ization we are coming into our
inheritance, and this heirloom in
cludes the best that any man has
done or thought since history and
literature and art began. Of one
blood are all the people of theearth,
and whatsoever is done to the least
of these little ones in some degree
comes to me. It is said that
through the bonds of commerce,
common trade and common need,
there is growing up the fund of a
great "bank of human kindness,"
no genuine draft on which is ever
left dishonored. Whoever is in
need of help the world over, by that
token has a claim on us.
In our material life we draw our
resources from every land. We
need the best work of every nation
and every nation asks our best of
us. The day of home-brewed ale,
of home-made bread and home-spun
clothing is already past with us.
With home made garments also pass
away inherited politics and hered
itary religion, with all the support
of caste and with all its barriers.
We must work all this out for our
selves; we must make our own
place in society; we must frame our
own creeds, we must live our own
religion; for no longer can one
man's religion be taken unquestion
ably by any other. With all this,
the simplicity of life is passing
away. The caravan traverses our
front yard. We speak to millions,
millions speak to us; and we must
cultivate the social tact, the gentle
ness, the adroitness, the firmness
necessary to carry out our own
designs without thwarting those of
others. Time no longer Hows on
evenly. We must he swift and
accurate in the part we play in a
drama so mighty, so strenuous and
so complex.
More than any of the others, the
Twentieth Century will be demo
cratic. The greatest discovery of
the Nineteenth Century was that
of the reality of external things.
If something needs doing, do it.
The more plainly,directly, honestly,
the better.
The earlier centuries cared little
for the life of a man. In masses
and mobs they needed kings and
rulers, but could not choose them.
The people could not follow those
they understood or who understood
them. They must trust all to the
blind chance of heredity. Not the
man who would do or think or help,
but the eldest son of a former lord
was chosen for their homage. The
result of it all was that no use

was made of the forces of nature;
for those who might have learned
to control them were hunted to
their death.
So in this strenuous and complex
age, this age of "fierce democracy,"
what have we to do, and with
what manner of men shall we
work? Young men of the Twen
tieth Century, will your limes find
place for you? There is plenty to
do in every direction. In agricul
ture a whole great empire is yet to
he won in the arid West; and the
West that is not arid and the East
that was never so, must he turned
into one vast market-garden. The
Twentieth Century will treat a farm
as a friend and it will yield rich
returns for such friendship. In the
Twentieth Century vast regions will
he fitted to civilization, not by im
perialism, which blasts, but by
permeation, which reclaims.
There is need of men in forestry;
for we must win hack the trees we
have slain with such ruthless hand.
Every man who masters what is al
ready known in any one branch of
applied science, makes his own for
tune. Me who can add a little,
save a little, do something better or
something cheaper, makes the for
tune of a hundred others. "There
is always room for a man of force,
and he makes room for many."
There iB no limit to the demands
of engineering. Sunshine and fall
ing water can be tramsmuted into
power. This power already lights
the cities of California, and some
day it may be changed into the heat
which moves a thousand factories.
From end to end of the continent
the Twentieth Century will bring
gold to light, and the mining engi
neer who knows the mountains best
finds his fortune ready to his hand.
Whoever knows how to manage
things or men, finds an eager wel
come. There are never too many
of those who know how; but the
day of the rule of thumb has long
since passed. The engineer of to
day must create, not imitate. And
to him who can create,'this last cen
tury we call the Twentieth, is yet
part of the first day of Creation.
In commerce, the field is always
open for young men. The world's
trade is barely yet begun. We
hear people whining over the spread
of the commercial spirit, but what
they mean is not the spirit of com
merce. Through commerce grows
tolerance, and through tolerance,
peace and solidarity. Freedom
breeds commerce as commerce de
mands freedom. When China is a
nation, her people will be no longer
a "yellow peril."
There are ten vessels today pass
ing in and out of the Golden Gate
to one in 1880. Another twenty
five years will see a hundred times
as many. We have discovered the
orient, â€”and even more, the orient
has discovered us. We may not
rule it by force of arms; for that
counts nothing in trade or civiliza
tion. Commerce follows the flag
only when it Hies on merchant
ships. Commerce follows fair play
anil mutual service. The centuries
of war have only played at com
merce. The Twentieth Century will
take it seriously,and it will call for
men to do its work. It will call
more loudly than war has ever
done, but it will ask its men not to
die bravely, but to live wisely, and
above all, truthfully, to watch their
accounts.
The reward of pure science will
be, in the future as in the past, of
its own kind, not fame nor money,
but the joy of knowing. To the
student of nature, money means
only the power to do more or better
work.
Most of the books the Twentieth
Century will print will not be lit
erature, for idle books are written
for idle people, and many idle peo
ple are left over from less insistent
times. The literature of form is
giving way already to the literature
of power. We care less and less
for the surprises and scintillations
of clever fellows; we care more and
more for the real thoughts of real
men. We find that the deepest
thoughts can be expressed in the
simplest language.
In medicine, the field of action
is growing infinitely broader, now
that its training is securely based
on science, and the divining rod no
longer stands first among its im
plements of precision. There is
room for no more doctors whose
highest conception is to look wise,
take chances, and pocket the fee;
room for no more doctors, now when
the doctor must be an honest man,
with a sound knowledge of the hu
man body and a mastery of the
methods of the sciences on which
this knowledge depends.
What is true of medicine applies
also to the profession of law. The"
law is not a device for getting
around the statutes. It is the
science and art of equity. The
lawyers of the future will not be
u ere pleaders before juries; they
will save their client* from need of
judge or jury.
In politics, the demand for ser
ious service must grow. We shall
demand not only men who can
lead in action, but men who can
prevent unwise action. Often the
policy which seems most attractive
to the majority, is full of danger
for the future. We need men who
can face popular opinion, and if
need be, to face it down.
As we look at it in the rough, the
political outlook of democracy of
ten seems discouraging. A great,
rich, busy nation cannot stop to see
who grabs its pennies. We are
plundered by the rich, we are rob
bed by the poor, and trusts and un
ions play the tyrant over both.
But all these evils are temporary.
The men that have solved greater
problems in the past will not he
balked by these.
In all this, the journalist of the
future may find an honorable place,
lie will learn to temper enterprise
with justice, audacity with fidelity,
omniscience with truthfulness. To
mould public opinion, to furnish a
truthful picture of the times from
day to day, either of these ideals
in journalism gives ample room for
the play of the highest manly en
ergy.
It is said that the teacher's nob
lest work is to lead the child to his
inheritance. This is the inheritance
he would win; the truth that men
have tested in the past, and the
means by which they were led to
know that it was truth. "Free
should the scholar be, â€”free and
brave."
The religion of this century will
be more practical, more real. It
will deal with the days of the week
as well as with the Sabbath. It
will be as patent in the marts of
trade as in the walls of a cathedral,
for a man's religion is his working
hypothesis of life, not of life in
some future world, but of life light
here today, the only day we have
in which to build a life. The world
of today will be a world of
and color and joy, a world in which
each of us may have a noble, though

humble, part. It will find religion
in love and wisdom and virtue.
It is the loyalty to duty, the love
of God through the love of men,
which may transform the workshop
to a cathedral.
What sort of men does the cent
ury need for all this work it has to
do? We may be sure that it will
choose its own, and those who can
not serve it, will be cast aside un
pitying. Those it can use, it will
pay generously, each after its kind,
some with money, some with fame,
some with the sense of power, some
with the joy of service. Some will
work hard in spite of vast wealth,
some only after taking the vow of
poverty.
Those not needed you can find
any day. They lean against lamp
posts in platoons, they crowd the
saloons, they stand about railway
stations all day long to see trains
go by. They dally on the lounges
of fashionable clubs. They may
be had tied in bundles by the
employers of menial labor. You
whom the century wants must be
the spirit of the times, strenuous,
complex, democratic.
A young man is a mighty reser
voir of unused power. Men of
training the century must demand.
It is impossible to drop into great
ness. It is as easy to do great
things as small, if you only know
how. The only way to learn to do
great things is to do small things
well, patiently, loyally. No wise
man begrudges any of the time
spent in the preparation for life, so
long as it is actually making ready.
The value of college training of to
day cannot be too strongly em
phasized. You cannot save time
nor money by omitting it, what
ever the profession on which you
enter. The college is becoming a
part of life. There was a time
when the college education did not
seem to disclose the secret of power,
and the man of affairs would have
none of it.
The American university is de
veloping its own essential idea, â€”
that of personal effectiveness. The
American university of today seeks
neither culture nor erudition as its
final end. It will value culture and
treasure erudition, but it will use
both as helps toward doing things.
It will find its inspiration in the
needs of the world as it is, and it is
through such effort that the world
that is to be shall be made a real
ity.
Besides a college education the
Twentieth Century will demand the
best special training which its best
universities can give. It will create
its own, and the young man who
does the century's work will be a
product of its university system.
The training for strenuous life is
not in academic idleness. The
blaso, lukewarm, fin-de-siecle young
man of the clubs will not represent
university culture, nor on the other
hand will culture be dominated by
a cheap utilitarianism.
The age will demand steady
headed men, men whose feet stand
on the ground, men who can see
things as they really are and act ac
cordingly. Not in air-built Utopias,
but in flesh and blood, wood and
stone and iron, will the movement
of humanity find its realization.
The man who is successful will
have but one dream, and that will
work itself out as a purpose. The
man of purpose says no to all lesser
calls, all minor opportunities.
He does not abandon his college
education because a hundred dol
lar position is offered him outside.
He does not turn from one profes

sion because there is money in an
other. He has his claim staked
out, and with time he will only fill
in the detail of its boundaries.
The Twentieth Century will ask
for men of instant decision, â€”men
whose mental equipment is all in
order, ready to be used on the in
stant. Yes and no, right and wrong,
we must have them labelled and
ready to pack to go anywhere to do
anything at any time, or to know
why we refuse to do it if it is some
thing we will not do.
The man of the Twentieth Cent
ury will be a hopeful man. He
will love the world and the world
will love him. He will be a loyal
man, considering always the best
interests of him he serves, ready to
lay down his life, if need be, for
duty, ready to abandon whatever
conflicts with higher loyalty, with
higher duty.
In the labor struggles of today
there are two huge mistakes which
may in time undo whatever of good
the labor unions may accomplish.
One of these is the struggle against
education, the effort to limit the
number of skilled laborers. The
other is the effort to destroy the
feeling of personal loyalty on the
part of the laborer. Half the value
of any man's service lies in his
willingness, his devotion to the
man or the work. This old fash
ioned virtue of loyalty must not be
cheapened. The man whose ser
vice is worth paying for gives more
than his labor. In the long run
the laborer can get no more than
he deserves, and disloyal labor is
paving the way for its own sudju
gation. Unwil ling service is a form
of slavery, and unwilling employ
ment is a slavery of the employer.
The man of the Twentieth Century
needs must be a man of character.
It was said of Abraham Lincoln
that he was a man "too simply
great to scheme for his proper self."
The man who schemes for his own
advancement soon forfeits the sup
port of others. A man need take
no heed for his own particular fut
ure. He will find his place in the
fnture of his work.
In the ordinary business of life,
the smart man has had his day.
He gives place to the man who can
bring about results. Whatever the
present menace of trusts and mo
nopoly, the business of the future
must be conducted on large lines.-
The profits of the future willbe the
legitimate reward of economy, or
ganization, and boldness of concep
tion. To this end, absolute honesty
is essential to success. Business
of a large scale must finally de
mand publicity and equity. Sooner
or later even monopolies must
grant this, whether we insist on it
by statute or not.
Above all, because including all,
the century will ask for men of
sober mind. The finest piece of
mechanism in all the universe is
the brain of man and the mitid
which is its manifestation. What
mind is, or how it is related to
brain cells we cannot say, but this
we know, that as the brain is, so is
the mind; whatever injury comes
to the one is shown in the other.
In this complex structure, with its
millions of connecting cells, we are
able to form images of the external
world, truthful as far as they go, to
retain these images, to compare
them, to infer relations of cause
and effect, to induce thought from
sensation and to translate thought
into action. In proportion to the
exactness of these operations is the
soundness, the effectiveness of the
man. The man is the mind, and
everything else is accessory. The.
sober man is the one who protects
his brain from all that would do it
harm. Ileal happiness does not
come through vice. You will know
that which is genuine because it
makes room for more happiness.
The pleasures of vice are mere illu
sionsâ€” tricks of the nervous system,
and each time these tricks are
played it is more and more difficult
for the mind to tell the truth. A
physical vice becomes a moral vice,
and all vice leaves its record on the
nervous system. To cultivate viceis

our mind incapableof normal action.

you throw away his patrimony?
Will you turn over to him a brain
distorted, a mind diseased, a will
untrained to action, a spinal cord
grown through and through with
the devil-grass of that vile harvest
we call wild oats?
This is your problem in life, the
problem of more importance to you
than any or all others. How will
you solve it? Will you meet it as
a man or as a fool? When you
answer this, we shall know what
use the Twentieth Century can
make of you.

us with a rush of energy that no
century has shown before. Let us
stand aside for a moment that we
may see what kind of a century it
is to he, what is the work it has to
do, and what manner of men it will
demand to do it.
In most regiirds one century is
like another. Just as men are men,
so times are times. Just as each
individual man has the same
organs, the same passions, the
same functions as all others,so it is
with all the cent uries. Not wars and
conquests mark a century. The
hosts grow small in the vanishing
perspective, "the captains and the
kings depart," but the thoughts of
men, their attitude toward their
environment, their struggles toward
duty, these are the things which
endure.
Compared with the centuries that
are past, the Twentieth Century in
its broad outlines will be like the
rest. It will be selfish, generous,
careless, devoted, fatuous, efficient.
Hut time of its traits must stand
out above all others, each raised to
a higher degree than any other
century has known. TheTwentieth
Century above all others will he
strenuous, complex and democratic.
Strenuous the century must be,
of course. This we can all see, and
we have to thank the young man of
the Twentieth Century who gave us
the watchword of "the strenuous

life" and who has raised the apt
phrase to the dignity of a national
purpose. Our century has a host
of things to do. If we are called to
help in this work, there is no time
for an idle minute. "The color of
life is red." Already the fad of the
drooping spirit, the end-of-the-cen
tury pose,Mhas given way to the
rush of the strenuous life, to the
feeling that struggle brings its own
reward. Life is repaid by the joy
of living it.
As the century is strenuous so
will it he complex. The complexity
of life is shown by the extension of
the necessity of choice. EacTt of us
has to render a decision, to say yes
or no, a hundred times when our
grandfathers were called upon a
single time. Through modern civil
ization we are coming into our
inheritance, and this heirloom in
cludes the best that any man has
done or thought since history and
literature and art began. Of one
blood are all the people of theearth,
and whatsoever is done to the least
of these little ones in some degree
comes to me. It is said that
through the bonds of commerce,
common trade and common need,
there is growing up the fund of a
great "bank of human kindness,"
no genuine draft on which is ever
left dishonored. Whoever is in
need of help the world over, by that
token has a claim on us.
In our material life we draw our
resources from every land. We
need the best work of every nation
and every nation asks our best of
us. The day of home-brewed ale,
of home-made bread and home-spun
clothing is already past with us.
With home made garments also pass
away inherited politics and hered
itary religion, with all the support
of caste and with all its barriers.
We must work all this out for our
selves; we must make our own
place in society; we must frame our
own creeds, we must live our own
religion; for no longer can one
man's religion be taken unquestion
ably by any other. With all this,
the simplicity of life is passing
away. The caravan traverses our
front yard. We speak to millions,
millions speak to us; and we must
cultivate the social tact, the gentle
ness, the adroitness, the firmness
necessary to carry out our own
designs without thwarting those of
others. Time no longer Hows on
evenly. We must he swift and
accurate in the part we play in a
drama so mighty, so strenuous and
so complex.
More than any of the others, the
Twentieth Century will be demo
cratic. The greatest discovery of
the Nineteenth Century was that
of the reality of external things.
If something needs doing, do it.
The more plainly,directly, honestly,
the better.
The earlier centuries cared little
for the life of a man. In masses
and mobs they needed kings and
rulers, but could not choose them.
The people could not follow those
they understood or who understood
them. They must trust all to the
blind chance of heredity. Not the
man who would do or think or help,
but the eldest son of a former lord
was chosen for their homage. The
result of it all was that no use

was made of the forces of nature;
for those who might have learned
to control them were hunted to
their death.
So in this strenuous and complex
age, this age of "fierce democracy,"
what have we to do, and with
what manner of men shall we
work? Young men of the Twen
tieth Century, will your limes find
place for you? There is plenty to
do in every direction. In agricul
ture a whole great empire is yet to
he won in the arid West; and the
West that is not arid and the East
that was never so, must he turned
into one vast market-garden. The
Twentieth Century will treat a farm
as a friend and it will yield rich
returns for such friendship. In the
Twentieth Century vast regions will
he fitted to civilization, not by im
perialism, which blasts, but by
permeation, which reclaims.
There is need of men in forestry;
for we must win hack the trees we
have slain with such ruthless hand.
Every man who masters what is al
ready known in any one branch of
applied science, makes his own for
tune. Me who can add a little,
save a little, do something better or
something cheaper, makes the for
tune of a hundred others. "There
is always room for a man of force,
and he makes room for many."
There iB no limit to the demands
of engineering. Sunshine and fall
ing water can be tramsmuted into
power. This power already lights
the cities of California, and some
day it may be changed into the heat
which moves a thousand factories.
From end to end of the continent
the Twentieth Century will bring
gold to light, and the mining engi
neer who knows the mountains best
finds his fortune ready to his hand.
Whoever knows how to manage
things or men, finds an eager wel
come. There are never too many
of those who know how; but the
day of the rule of thumb has long
since passed. The engineer of to
day must create, not imitate. And
to him who can create,'this last cen
tury we call the Twentieth, is yet
part of the first day of Creation.
In commerce, the field is always
open for young men. The world's
trade is barely yet begun. We
hear people whining over the spread
of the commercial spirit, but what
they mean is not the spirit of com
merce. Through commerce grows
tolerance, and through tolerance,
peace and solidarity. Freedom
breeds commerce as commerce de
mands freedom. When China is a
nation, her people will be no longer
a "yellow peril."
There are ten vessels today pass
ing in and out of the Golden Gate
to one in 1880. Another twenty
five years will see a hundred times
as many. We have discovered the
orient, â€”and even more, the orient
has discovered us. We may not
rule it by force of arms; for that
counts nothing in trade or civiliza
tion. Commerce follows the flag
only when it Hies on merchant
ships. Commerce follows fair play
anil mutual service. The centuries
of war have only played at com
merce. The Twentieth Century will
take it seriously,and it will call for
men to do its work. It will call
more loudly than war has ever
done, but it will ask its men not to
die bravely, but to live wisely, and
above all, truthfully, to watch their
accounts.
The reward of pure science will
be, in the future as in the past, of
its own kind, not fame nor money,
but the joy of knowing. To the
student of nature, money means
only the power to do more or better
work.
Most of the books the Twentieth
Century will print will not be lit
erature, for idle books are written
for idle people, and many idle peo
ple are left over from less insistent
times. The literature of form is
giving way already to the literature
of power. We care less and less
for the surprises and scintillations
of clever fellows; we care more and
more for the real thoughts of real
men. We find that the deepest
thoughts can be expressed in the
simplest language.
In medicine, the field of action
is growing infinitely broader, now
that its training is securely based
on science, and the divining rod no
longer stands first among its im
plements of precision. There is
room for no more doctors whose
highest conception is to look wise,
take chances, and pocket the fee;
room for no more doctors, now when
the doctor must be an honest man,
with a sound knowledge of the hu
man body and a mastery of the
methods of the sciences on which
this knowledge depends.
What is true of medicine applies
also to the profession of law. The"
law is not a device for getting
around the statutes. It is the
science and art of equity. The
lawyers of the future will not be
u ere pleaders before juries; they
will save their client* from need of
judge or jury.
In politics, the demand for ser
ious service must grow. We shall
demand not only men who can
lead in action, but men who can
prevent unwise action. Often the
policy which seems most attractive
to the majority, is full of danger
for the future. We need men who
can face popular opinion, and if
need be, to face it down.
As we look at it in the rough, the
political outlook of democracy of
ten seems discouraging. A great,
rich, busy nation cannot stop to see
who grabs its pennies. We are
plundered by the rich, we are rob
bed by the poor, and trusts and un
ions play the tyrant over both.
But all these evils are temporary.
The men that have solved greater
problems in the past will not he
balked by these.
In all this, the journalist of the
future may find an honorable place,
lie will learn to temper enterprise
with justice, audacity with fidelity,
omniscience with truthfulness. To
mould public opinion, to furnish a
truthful picture of the times from
day to day, either of these ideals
in journalism gives ample room for
the play of the highest manly en
ergy.
It is said that the teacher's nob
lest work is to lead the child to his
inheritance. This is the inheritance
he would win; the truth that men
have tested in the past, and the
means by which they were led to
know that it was truth. "Free
should the scholar be, â€”free and
brave."
The religion of this century will
be more practical, more real. It
will deal with the days of the week
as well as with the Sabbath. It
will be as patent in the marts of
trade as in the walls of a cathedral,
for a man's religion is his working
hypothesis of life, not of life in
some future world, but of life light
here today, the only day we have
in which to build a life. The world
of today will be a world of
and color and joy, a world in which
each of us may have a noble, though

humble, part. It will find religion
in love and wisdom and virtue.
It is the loyalty to duty, the love
of God through the love of men,
which may transform the workshop
to a cathedral.
What sort of men does the cent
ury need for all this work it has to
do? We may be sure that it will
choose its own, and those who can
not serve it, will be cast aside un
pitying. Those it can use, it will
pay generously, each after its kind,
some with money, some with fame,
some with the sense of power, some
with the joy of service. Some will
work hard in spite of vast wealth,
some only after taking the vow of
poverty.
Those not needed you can find
any day. They lean against lamp
posts in platoons, they crowd the
saloons, they stand about railway
stations all day long to see trains
go by. They dally on the lounges
of fashionable clubs. They may
be had tied in bundles by the
employers of menial labor. You
whom the century wants must be
the spirit of the times, strenuous,
complex, democratic.
A young man is a mighty reser
voir of unused power. Men of
training the century must demand.
It is impossible to drop into great
ness. It is as easy to do great
things as small, if you only know
how. The only way to learn to do
great things is to do small things
well, patiently, loyally. No wise
man begrudges any of the time
spent in the preparation for life, so
long as it is actually making ready.
The value of college training of to
day cannot be too strongly em
phasized. You cannot save time
nor money by omitting it, what
ever the profession on which you
enter. The college is becoming a
part of life. There was a time
when the college education did not
seem to disclose the secret of power,
and the man of affairs would have
none of it.
The American university is de
veloping its own essential idea, â€”
that of personal effectiveness. The
American university of today seeks
neither culture nor erudition as its
final end. It will value culture and
treasure erudition, but it will use
both as helps toward doing things.
It will find its inspiration in the
needs of the world as it is, and it is
through such effort that the world
that is to be shall be made a real
ity.
Besides a college education the
Twentieth Century will demand the
best special training which its best
universities can give. It will create
its own, and the young man who
does the century's work will be a
product of its university system.
The training for strenuous life is
not in academic idleness. The
blaso, lukewarm, fin-de-siecle young
man of the clubs will not represent
university culture, nor on the other
hand will culture be dominated by
a cheap utilitarianism.
The age will demand steady
headed men, men whose feet stand
on the ground, men who can see
things as they really are and act ac
cordingly. Not in air-built Utopias,
but in flesh and blood, wood and
stone and iron, will the movement
of humanity find its realization.
The man who is successful will
have but one dream, and that will
work itself out as a purpose. The
man of purpose says no to all lesser
calls, all minor opportunities.
He does not abandon his college
education because a hundred dol
lar position is offered him outside.
He does not turn from one profes

sion because there is money in an
other. He has his claim staked
out, and with time he will only fill
in the detail of its boundaries.
The Twentieth Century will ask
for men of instant decision, â€”men
whose mental equipment is all in
order, ready to be used on the in
stant. Yes and no, right and wrong,
we must have them labelled and
ready to pack to go anywhere to do
anything at any time, or to know
why we refuse to do it if it is some
thing we will not do.
The man of the Twentieth Cent
ury will be a hopeful man. He
will love the world and the world
will love him. He will be a loyal
man, considering always the best
interests of him he serves, ready to
lay down his life, if need be, for
duty, ready to abandon whatever
conflicts with higher loyalty, with
higher duty.
In the labor struggles of today
there are two huge mistakes which
may in time undo whatever of good
the labor unions may accomplish.
One of these is the struggle against
education, the effort to limit the
number of skilled laborers. The
other is the effort to destroy the
feeling of personal loyalty on the
part of the laborer. Half the value
of any man's service lies in his
willingness, his devotion to the
man or the work. This old fash
ioned virtue of loyalty must not be
cheapened. The man whose ser
vice is worth paying for gives more
than his labor. In the long run
the laborer can get no more than
he deserves, and disloyal labor is
paving the way for its own sudju
gation. Unwil ling service is a form
of slavery, and unwilling employ
ment is a slavery of the employer.
The man of the Twentieth Century
needs must be a man of character.
It was said of Abraham Lincoln
that he was a man "too simply
great to scheme for his proper self."
The man who schemes for his own
advancement soon forfeits the sup
port of others. A man need take
no heed for his own particular fut
ure. He will find his place in the
fnture of his work.
In the ordinary business of life,
the smart man has had his day.
He gives place to the man who can
bring about results. Whatever the
present menace of trusts and mo
nopoly, the business of the future
must be conducted on large lines.-
The profits of the future willbe the
legitimate reward of economy, or
ganization, and boldness of concep
tion. To this end, absolute honesty
is essential to success. Business
of a large scale must finally de
mand publicity and equity. Sooner
or later even monopolies must
grant this, whether we insist on it
by statute or not.
Above all, because including all,
the century will ask for men of
sober mind. The finest piece of
mechanism in all the universe is
the brain of man and the mitid
which is its manifestation. What
mind is, or how it is related to
brain cells we cannot say, but this
we know, that as the brain is, so is
the mind; whatever injury comes
to the one is shown in the other.
In this complex structure, with its
millions of connecting cells, we are
able to form images of the external
world, truthful as far as they go, to
retain these images, to compare
them, to infer relations of cause
and effect, to induce thought from
sensation and to translate thought
into action. In proportion to the
exactness of these operations is the
soundness, the effectiveness of the
man. The man is the mind, and
everything else is accessory. The.
sober man is the one who protects
his brain from all that would do it
harm. Ileal happiness does not
come through vice. You will know
that which is genuine because it
makes room for more happiness.
The pleasures of vice are mere illu
sionsâ€” tricks of the nervous system,
and each time these tricks are
played it is more and more difficult
for the mind to tell the truth. A
physical vice becomes a moral vice,
and all vice leaves its record on the
nervous system. To cultivate viceis
to render the actual machinery of
our mind incapableof normal action.
In our colleges, the one ethical
principle kept before the athlete by J
his associates is this: Never break
training rules. Some day we shall
realize that the game of life is more
than the game of football. We
have work every day more intricate
than pitching curves, more stren-1
uous than punting the ball. We
must keep in trim for it. We must
remember training rules. When
this is done, we shall win not only
games and races, but the great
prizes of life. Half the strength of
the men of America is now wasted
in dissipation, gross or petty, in
drink or smoke.
If it were ever my fortune in
speaking to young men to become
eloquent, with the only genuine
eloquence there is, the plain speak
ing of a living truth, this I would
say: Your first duty in life is toward
your after-self. So live that your
after-self, the man you ought to be,
may in his time be possible and
actual. Far away in the twenties,
the thiities of the Twentieth Cen
tury, he is awaiting his time. His
body, his brain, his soul are in
vour boyish hands. He cannot
help himself. What will you leave
for him? Will it be a brain
unspoiled by lust or dissipation, a
mind trained to think and act, a
nervous system true as a dial in its
response to the truth about us?
Will you, boy of the Twentieth
Century, let him come as a man
among men in his time? Or will
you throw away his patrimony?
Will you turn over to him a brain
distorted, a mind diseased, a will
untrained to action, a spinal cord
grown through and through with
the devil-grass of that vile harvest
we call wild oats?
This is your problem in life, the
problem of more importance to you
than any or all others. How will
you solve it? Will you meet it as
a man or as a fool? When you
answer this, we shall know what
use the Twentieth Century can
make of you.
"Death is a thing cleaner than
vice," Owen Wister tells us, and in
the long run it is more profitable.
Charles 11. Brown tells us of the old
physician showing the physical
effects of vice in the Museum of
Pathology. This is what he said:
"Almighty God writes a very plain
hand." In every failure as in
every success in the Twentieth Cen
tury, this plain hand can be plainly
traced.
Those who control the spiritual
thought of the Twentieth Century
will be religious men. They will
not be religious in the fashion of
monks, ascetics, mystic dreamers,
or emotional enthusiasts. They
will not be active in debating
societies, discussing the intricacies
of creeds. Neither will they be

sticklers as to details in religious
millinery. They will be simple,
earnest, God-fearing, because they
have known the God that makes for
righteousness. Their religion of
the Twentieth Century will he its
working theory of life. It will be
expressed in simple terms or it may
not he expressed at all, but it will be
deepgraven in the heart. In wiseand
helpful life it will find ample justi
fication. It will deal with the
world as it is in the service of "the
God of things as they are." It will
find this world not "a vale of tears,''
a sink of iniquity, but a working
paradise in which the rewards
of right-doing are instant and
constant. It will find indeed that
"His service is perfect freedom,"for !
all things large or small within the
reach of human effort are done in
His way and His way only.
"Glad did I live and gladly die
Anil I lay me down with a will."
This was Stevenson's word. "Let
God do his work; we will see to
ours." And in whatever part of
God's kingdom we men of the
Twentieth Century may find our
selves, we shall know that we are
at home. For the same hand that
made the world and the ages,
created also the men in whose
hands the final outcome of the
wayward centuries finds its place
within the Kingdom of Heaven.
It is the purpose of this Univer
sity to develop a certain ideal type
of man. This we cull for our con
venience "the Stanford man." In so
far as we are successful this man
will have a good many of the vir
tues of character ; but we do not
mean to claim a monopoly of
them. A good Harvard man, a
good Yale man, a good Cornell
man, a good Oxford man, any of
these would make a good Stanford
man. A good fellow in the noble
sense is a good fellow anywhere.
The good university man has cul
ture, character, scholarship, gentle
breeding, and perseverenee. All
these we can count on in some
fair degree in all real university
circles. But within the range of
all this we are trying at Stanford
to do one thing more. What this
is we hope that your own lives as
graduates and those of the fifteen
hundred alumni who have preceded
you may well exemplify.
We have tried to make you men
and women of the times. We
have tried to fit you to respond to
the demands of the twentieth cen
tury. Your training, as your
life, has been cast not in
the thirteenth century of ca
thedral building, not in the
sixteenth century of the revolt
of the intellect, not in the eight
eenth century of constitution mak
ing, or even in the nineteenth cen
tury with its discovery of the real
ity of external things, and the
presence of God in all temples,
even those made by hands. It is
in the twentieth century that you
live, in the twentieth century that
you are to work, and for the twen
tieth century you have had your
training. It is for the work of the
twentieth century that you go out
today as Stanford men and wo
men.
The new century has come upon
us with a rush of energy that no
century has shown before. Let us
stand aside for a moment that we
may see what kind of a century it
is to he, what is the work it has to
do, and what manner of men it will
demand to do it.

duty, these are the things which
endure.
Compared with the centuries that
are past, the Twentieth Century in
its broad outlines will be like the
rest. It will be selfish, generous,
careless, devoted, fatuous, efficient.
Hut time of its traits must stand
out above all others, each raised to
a higher degree than any other
century has known. TheTwentieth
Century above all others will he
strenuous, complex and democratic.
Strenuous the century must be,
of course. This we can all see, and
we have to thank the young man of

In commerce, the field is always
open for young men. The world's
trade is barely yet begun. We
hear people whining over the spread
of the commercial spirit, but what
they mean is not the spirit of com
merce. Through commerce grows
tolerance, and through tolerance,
peace and solidarity. Freedom
breeds commerce as commerce de
mands freedom. When China is a
nation, her people will be no longer
a "yellow peril."
There are ten vessels today pass
ing in and out of the Golden Gate
to one in 1880. Another twenty
five years will see a hundred times
as many. We have discovered the
orient, â€”and even more, the orient
has discovered us. We may not
rule it by force of arms; for that
counts nothing in trade or civiliza
tion. Commerce follows the flag
only when it Hies on merchant
ships. Commerce follows fair play
anil mutual service. The centuries
of war have only played at com
merce. The Twentieth Century will
take it seriously,and it will call for
men to do its work. It will call
more loudly than war has ever
done, but it will ask its men not to
die bravely, but to live wisely, and
above all, truthfully, to watch their
accounts.
The reward of pure science will
be, in the future as in the past, of
its own kind, not fame nor money,
but the joy of knowing. To the
student of nature, money means
only the power to do more or better
work.
Most of the books the Twentieth
Century will print will not be lit
erature, for idle books are written
for idle people, and many idle peo
ple are left over from less insistent
times. The literature of form is
giving way already to the literature
of power. We care less and less
for the surprises and scintillations
of clever fellows; we care more and
more for the real thoughts of real
men. We find that the deepest
thoughts can be expressed in the
simplest language.
In medicine, the field of action
is growing infinitely broader, now
that its training is securely based
on science, and the divining rod no
longer stands first among its im
plements of precision. There is
room for no more doctors whose
highest conception is to look wise,
take chances, and pocket the fee;
room for no more doctors, now when
the doctor must be an honest man,
with a sound knowledge of the hu
man body and a mastery of the
methods of the sciences on which
this knowledge depends.
What is true of medicine applies
also to the profession of law. The"
law is not a device for getting
around the statutes. It is the
science and art of equity. The
lawyers of the future will not be
u ere pleaders before juries; they
will save their client* from need of
judge or jury.
In politics, the demand for ser
ious service must grow. We shall
demand not only men who can
lead in action, but men who can
prevent unwise action. Often the
policy which seems most attractive
to the majority, is full of danger
for the future. We need men who
can face popular opinion, and if
need be, to face it down.
As we look at it in the rough, the
political outlook of democracy of
ten seems discouraging. A great,
rich, busy nation cannot stop to see
who grabs its pennies. We are
plundered by the rich, we are rob
bed by the poor, and trusts and un
ions play the tyrant over both.
But all these evils are temporary.
The men that have solved greater
problems in the past will not he
balked by these.
In all this, the journalist of the
future may find an honorable place,
lie will learn to temper enterprise
with justice, audacity with fidelity,
omniscience with truthfulness. To
mould public opinion, to furnish a
truthful picture of the times from
day to day, either of these ideals
in journalism gives ample room for
the play of the highest manly en
ergy.
It is said that the teacher's nob
lest work is to lead the child to his
inheritance. This is the inheritance
he would win; the truth that men
have tested in the past, and the
means by which they were led to
know that it was truth. "Free
should the scholar be, â€”free and
brave."
The religion of this century will
be more practical, more real. It
will deal with the days of the week
as well as with the Sabbath. It
will be as patent in the marts of
trade as in the walls of a cathedral,
for a man's religion is his working
hypothesis of life, not of life in
some future world, but of life light
here today, the only day we have
in which to build a life. The world
of today will be a world of
and color and joy, a world in which
each of us may have a noble, though

humble, part. It will find religion
in love and wisdom and virtue.
It is the loyalty to duty, the love
of God through the love of men,
which may transform the workshop
to a cathedral.
What sort of men does the cent
ury need for all this work it has to
do? We may be sure that it will
choose its own, and those who can
not serve it, will be cast aside un
pitying. Those it can use, it will
pay generously, each after its kind,
some with money, some with fame,
some with the sense of power, some
with the joy of service. Some will
work hard in spite of vast wealth,
some only after taking the vow of
poverty.
Those not needed you can find
any day. They lean against lamp
posts in platoons, they crowd the
saloons, they stand about railway
stations all day long to see trains
go by. They dally on the lounges
of fashionable clubs. They may
be had tied in bundles by the
employers of menial labor. You
whom the century wants must be
the spirit of the times, strenuous,
complex, democratic.
A young man is a mighty reser
voir of unused power. Men of
training the century must demand.
It is impossible to drop into great
ness. It is as easy to do great
things as small, if you only know
how. The only way to learn to do
great things is to do small things
well, patiently, loyally. No wise
man begrudges any of the time
spent in the preparation for life, so
long as it is actually making ready.
The value of college training of to
day cannot be too strongly em
phasized. You cannot save time
nor money by omitting it, what
ever the profession on which you
enter. The college is becoming a
part of life. There was a time
when the college education did not
seem to disclose the secret of power,
and the man of affairs would have
none of it.
The American university is de
veloping its own essential idea, â€”
that of personal effectiveness. The
American university of today seeks
neither culture nor erudition as its
final end. It will value culture and
treasure erudition, but it will use
both as helps toward doing things.
It will find its inspiration in the
needs of the world as it is, and it is
through such effort that the world
that is to be shall be made a real
ity.
Besides a college education the
Twentieth Century will demand the
best special training which its best
universities can give. It will create
its own, and the young man who
does the century's work will be a
product of its university system.
The training for strenuous life is
not in academic idleness. The
blaso, lukewarm, fin-de-siecle young
man of the clubs will not represent
university culture, nor on the other
hand will culture be dominated by
a cheap utilitarianism.
The age will demand steady
headed men, men whose feet stand
on the ground, men who can see
things as they really are and act ac
cordingly. Not in air-built Utopias,
but in flesh and blood, wood and
stone and iron, will the movement
of humanity find its realization.
The man who is successful will
have but one dream, and that will
work itself out as a purpose. The
man of purpose says no to all lesser
calls, all minor opportunities.
He does not abandon his college
education because a hundred dol
lar position is offered him outside.
He does not turn from one profes

sion because there is money in an
other. He has his claim staked
out, and with time he will only fill
in the detail of its boundaries.
The Twentieth Century will ask
for men of instant decision, â€”men
whose mental equipment is all in
order, ready to be used on the in
stant. Yes and no, right and wrong,
we must have them labelled and
ready to pack to go anywhere to do
anything at any time, or to know
why we refuse to do it if it is some
thing we will not do.
The man of the Twentieth Cent
ury will be a hopeful man. He
will love the world and the world
will love him. He will be a loyal
man, considering always the best
interests of him he serves, ready to
lay down his life, if need be, for
duty, ready to abandon whatever
conflicts with higher loyalty, with
higher duty.
In the labor struggles of today
there are two huge mistakes which
may in time undo whatever of good
the labor unions may accomplish.
One of these is the struggle against
education, the effort to limit the
number of skilled laborers. The
other is the effort to destroy the
feeling of personal loyalty on the
part of the laborer. Half the value
of any man's service lies in his
willingness, his devotion to the
man or the work. This old fash
ioned virtue of loyalty must not be
cheapened. The man whose ser
vice is worth paying for gives more
than his labor. In the long run
the laborer can get no more than
he deserves, and disloyal labor is
paving the way for its own sudju
gation. Unwil ling service is a form
of slavery, and unwilling employ
ment is a slavery of the employer.
The man of the Twentieth Century
needs must be a man of character.
It was said of Abraham Lincoln
that he was a man "too simply
great to scheme for his proper self."
The man who schemes for his own
advancement soon forfeits the sup
port of others. A man need take
no heed for his own particular fut
ure. He will find his place in the
fnture of his work.
In the ordinary business of life,
the smart man has had his day.
He gives place to the man who can
bring about results. Whatever the
present menace of trusts and mo
nopoly, the business of the future
must be conducted on large lines.-
The profits of the future willbe the
legitimate reward of economy, or
ganization, and boldness of concep
tion. To this end, absolute honesty
is essential to success. Business
of a large scale must finally de
mand publicity and equity. Sooner
or later even monopolies must
grant this, whether we insist on it
by statute or not.
Above all, because including all,
the century will ask for men of
sober mind. The finest piece of
mechanism in all the universe is
the brain of man and the mitid
which is its manifestation. What
mind is, or how it is related to
brain cells we cannot say, but this
we know, that as the brain is, so is
the mind; whatever injury comes
to the one is shown in the other.
In this complex structure, with its
millions of connecting cells, we are
able to form images of the external
world, truthful as far as they go, to
retain these images, to compare
them, to infer relations of cause
and effect, to induce thought from
sensation and to translate thought
into action. In proportion to the
exactness of these operations is the
soundness, the effectiveness of the
man. The man is the mind, and
everything else is accessory. The.
sober man is the one who protects
his brain from all that would do it
harm. Ileal happiness does not
come through vice. You will know
that which is genuine because it
makes room for more happiness.
The pleasures of vice are mere illu
sionsâ€” tricks of the nervous system,
and each time these tricks are
played it is more and more difficult
for the mind to tell the truth. A
physical vice becomes a moral vice,
and all vice leaves its record on the
nervous system. To cultivate viceis
to render the actual machinery of
our mind incapableof normal action.
In our colleges, the one ethical
principle kept before the athlete by J
his associates is this: Never break
training rules. Some day we shall
realize that the game of life is more
than the game of football. We
have work every day more intricate
than pitching curves, more stren-1
uous than punting the ball. We
must keep in trim for it. We must
remember training rules. When
this is done, we shall win not only
games and races, but the great
prizes of life. Half the strength of
the men of America is now wasted
in dissipation, gross or petty, in
drink or smoke.
If it were ever my fortune in
speaking to young men to become
eloquent, with the only genuine
eloquence there is, the plain speak
ing of a living truth, this I would
say: Your first duty in life is toward
your after-self. So live that your
after-self, the man you ought to be,
may in his time be possible and
actual. Far away in the twenties,
the thiities of the Twentieth Cen
tury, he is awaiting his time. His
body, his brain, his soul are in
vour boyish hands. He cannot
help himself. What will you leave
for him? Will it be a brain
unspoiled by lust or dissipation, a
mind trained to think and act, a
nervous system true as a dial in its
response to the truth about us?
Will you, boy of the Twentieth
Century, let him come as a man
among men in his time? Or will
you throw away his patrimony?
Will you turn over to him a brain
distorted, a mind diseased, a will
untrained to action, a spinal cord
grown through and through with
the devil-grass of that vile harvest
we call wild oats?
This is your problem in life, the
problem of more importance to you
than any or all others. How will
you solve it? Will you meet it as
a man or as a fool? When you
answer this, we shall know what
use the Twentieth Century can
make of you.
"Death is a thing cleaner than
vice," Owen Wister tells us, and in
the long run it is more profitable.
Charles 11. Brown tells us of the old
physician showing the physical
effects of vice in the Museum of
Pathology. This is what he said:
"Almighty God writes a very plain
hand." In every failure as in
every success in the Twentieth Cen
tury, this plain hand can be plainly
traced.
Those who control the spiritual
thought of the Twentieth Century
will be religious men. They will
not be religious in the fashion of
monks, ascetics, mystic dreamers,
or emotional enthusiasts. They
will not be active in debating
societies, discussing the intricacies
of creeds. Neither will they be

sticklers as to details in religious
millinery. They will be simple,
earnest, God-fearing, because they
have known the God that makes for
righteousness. Their religion of
the Twentieth Century will he its
working theory of life. It will be
expressed in simple terms or it may
not he expressed at all, but it will be
deepgraven in the heart. In wiseand
helpful life it will find ample justi
fication. It will deal with the
world as it is in the service of "the
God of things as they are." It will
find this world not "a vale of tears,''
a sink of iniquity, but a working
paradise in which the rewards
of right-doing are instant and
constant. It will find indeed that
"His service is perfect freedom,"for !
all things large or small within the
reach of human effort are done in
His way and His way only.
"Glad did I live and gladly die
Anil I lay me down with a will."
This was Stevenson's word. "Let
God do his work; we will see to
ours." And in whatever part of
God's kingdom we men of the
Twentieth Century may find our
selves, we shall know that we are
at home. For the same hand that
made the world and the ages,
created also the men in whose
hands the final outcome of the
wayward centuries finds its place
within the Kingdom of Heaven.
