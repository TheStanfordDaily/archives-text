# ADDRESS BY DR. JORDAN.
## "The Stanford Man of the Twentieth Century" Delivered to the Graduating Class Commencement Day. 
### 
It is the purpose of this Univer
sity to develop a certain ideal type
of man. This we cull for our con
venience "the Stanford man." In so
far as we are successful this man
will have a good many of the vir
tues of character ; but we do not
mean to claim a monopoly of
them. A good Harvard man, a
good Yale man, a good Cornell
man, a good Oxford man, any of
these would make a good Stanford
man. A good fellow in the noble
sense is a good fellow anywhere.
The good university man has cul
ture, character, scholarship, gentle
breeding, and perseverenee. All
these we can count on in some
fair degree in all real university
circles. But within the range of
all this we are trying at Stanford
to do one thing more. What this
is we hope that your own lives as
graduates and those of the fifteen
hundred alumni who have preceded
you may well exemplify.
We have tried to make you men
and women of the times. We
have tried to fit you to respond to
the demands of the twentieth cen
tury. Your training, as your
life, has been cast not in
the thirteenth century of ca
thedral building, not in the
sixteenth century of the revolt
of the intellect, not in the eight
eenth century of constitution mak
ing, or even in the nineteenth cen
tury with its discovery of the real
ity of external things, and the
presence of God in all temples,
even those made by hands. It is
in the twentieth century that you
live, in the twentieth century that
you are to work, and for the twen
tieth century you have had your
training. It is for the work of the
twentieth century that you go out
today as Stanford men and wo
men.
The new century has come upon
us with a rush of energy that no
century has shown before. Let us
stand aside for a moment that we
may see what kind of a century it
is to he, what is the work it has to
do, and what manner of men it will
demand to do it.
In most regiirds one century is
like another. Just as men are men,
so times are times. Just as each
individual man has the same
organs, the same passions, the
same functions as all others,so it is
with all the cent uries. Not wars and
conquests mark a century. The
hosts grow small in the vanishing
perspective, "the captains and the
kings depart," but the thoughts of
men, their attitude toward their
environment, their struggles toward
duty, these are the things which
endure.
Compared with the centuries that
are past, the Twentieth Century in
its broad outlines will be like the
rest. It will be selfish, generous,
careless, devoted, fatuous, efficient.
Hut time of its traits must stand
out above all others, each raised to
a higher degree than any other
century has known. TheTwentieth
Century above all others will he
strenuous, complex and democratic.
Strenuous the century must be,
of course. This we can all see, and
we have to thank the young man of
the Twentieth Century who gave us
the watchword of "the strenuous

life" and who has raised the apt
phrase to the dignity of a national
purpose. Our century has a host
of things to do. If we are called to
help in this work, there is no time
for an idle minute. "The color of
life is red." Already the fad of the
drooping spirit, the end-of-the-cen
tury pose,Mhas given way to the
rush of the strenuous life, to the
feeling that struggle brings its own
reward. Life is repaid by the joy
of living it.
As the century is strenuous so
will it he complex. The complexity
of life is shown by the extension of
the necessity of choice. EacTt of us
has to render a decision, to say yes
or no, a hundred times when our
grandfathers were called upon a
single time. Through modern civil
ization we are coming into our
inheritance, and this heirloom in
cludes the best that any man has
done or thought since history and
literature and art began. Of one
blood are all the people of theearth,
and whatsoever is done to the least
of these little ones in some degree
comes to me. It is said that
through the bonds of commerce,
common trade and common need,
there is growing up the fund of a
great "bank of human kindness,"
no genuine draft on which is ever
left dishonored. Whoever is in
need of help the world over, by that
token has a claim on us.
In our material life we draw our
resources from every land. We
need the best work of every nation
and every nation asks our best of
us. The day of home-brewed ale,
of home-made bread and home-spun
clothing is already past with us.
With home made garments also pass
away inherited politics and hered
itary religion, with all the support
of caste and with all its barriers.
We must work all this out for our
selves; we must make our own
place in society; we must frame our
own creeds, we must live our own
religion; for no longer can one
man's religion be taken unquestion
ably by any other. With all this,
the simplicity of life is passing
away. The caravan traverses our
front yard. We speak to millions,
millions speak to us; and we must
cultivate the social tact, the gentle
ness, the adroitness, the firmness
necessary to carry out our own
designs without thwarting those of
others. Time no longer Hows on
evenly. We must he swift and
accurate in the part we play in a
drama so mighty, so strenuous and
so complex.
More than any of the others, the
Twentieth Century will be demo
cratic. The greatest discovery of
the Nineteenth Century was that
of the reality of external things.
If something needs doing, do it.
The more plainly,directly, honestly,
the better.
The earlier centuries cared little
for the life of a man. In masses
and mobs they needed kings and
rulers, but could not choose them.
The people could not follow those
they understood or who understood
them. They must trust all to the
blind chance of heredity. Not the
man who would do or think or help,
but the eldest son of a former lord
was chosen for their homage. The
result of it all was that no use

was made of the forces of nature;
for those who might have learned
to control them were hunted to
their death.
So in this strenuous and complex
age, this age of "fierce democracy,"
what have we to do, and with
what manner of men shall we
work? Young men of the Twen
tieth Century, will your limes find
place for you? There is plenty to
do in every direction. In agricul
ture a whole great empire is yet to
he won in the arid West; and the
West that is not arid and the East
that was never so, must he turned
into one vast market-garden. The
Twentieth Century will treat a farm
as a friend and it will yield rich
returns for such friendship. In the
Twentieth Century vast regions will
he fitted to civilization, not by im
perialism, which blasts, but by
permeation, which reclaims.
There is need of men in forestry;
for we must win hack the trees we
have slain with such ruthless hand.
Every man who masters what is al
ready known in any one branch of
applied science, makes his own for
tune. Me who can add a little,
save a little, do something better or
something cheaper, makes the for
tune of a hundred others. "There
is always room for a man of force,
and he makes room for many."
There iB no limit to the demands
of engineering. Sunshine and fall
ing water can be tramsmuted into
power. This power already lights
the cities of California, and some
day it may be changed into the heat
which moves a thousand factories.
From end to end of the continent
the Twentieth Century will bring
gold to light, and the mining engi
neer who knows the mountains best
finds his fortune ready to his hand.
Whoever knows how to manage
things or men, finds an eager wel
come. There are never too many
of those who know how; but the
day of the rule of thumb has long
since passed. The engineer of to
day must create, not imitate. And
to him who can create,'this last cen
tury we call the Twentieth, is yet
part of the first day of Creation.
In commerce, the field is always
open for young men. The world's
trade is barely yet begun. We
hear people whining over the spread
of the commercial spirit, but what
they mean is not the spirit of com
merce. Through commerce grows
tolerance, and through tolerance,
peace and solidarity. Freedom
breeds commerce as commerce de
mands freedom. When China is a
nation, her people will be no longer
a "yellow peril."
There are ten vessels today pass
ing in and out of the Golden Gate
to one in 1880. Another twenty
five years will see a hundred times
as many. We have discovered the
orient, â€”and even more, the orient
has discovered us. We may not
rule it by force of arms; for that
counts nothing in trade or civiliza
tion. Commerce follows the flag
only when it Hies on merchant
ships. Commerce follows fair play
anil mutual service. The centuries
of war have only played at com
merce. The Twentieth Century will
take it seriously,and it will call for
men to do its work. It will call
more loudly than war has ever
done, but it will ask its men not to
die bravely, but to live wisely, and
above all, truthfully, to watch their
accounts.
The reward of pure science will
be, in the future as in the past, of
its own kind, not fame nor money,
