# The Senior Farce.
## 
### 
The farce, "A Trick for a Tro
phy," by Waldemar Young,'o4, and
R. E. Renaud, '03, was one of the
best things of its kind ever put on
the Stanford stage. Every act was
good, the second better than the
first, and the third better than the
second. It was a fun-making farce
in which the lines were well writ
ten and fully suited to the actors.
There was not a single moment of
drag, and action was plentiful.
Every actor did his part well.
May as a comedian, Thomas as
leading man, Miss Kerr as leading
lady, Mies Bird as soubrette,
Young, Wilson, and Henley in
heavy comedian work, â€”all brought
applause. May and Wilson were
particularly good. Henley and
Wilson took female parts with ad
mirable conception.
The singing of the chorus was
good and received repeated encores.
