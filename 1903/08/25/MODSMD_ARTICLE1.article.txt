# LOCATION OF DEPARTMENTS.
## Changes in Old and New Quads. New Buildings Occupied for First Time. 
### 
While there has been little in
crease in the extent of the Univer
sity buildings during the summer,
the arrangement of the different
departments has been very mate
rially changed. The inner quad:
has been stripped of the larger de-1
partments, which have gone into
the new buildings of the outer
quad, completed last year.
The Registrar's office has been I
removed from its old quarters into 1
the old Geology laboratory. The
vacated room will he devoted to
the needs of Dr. Jordan, thus giv-j
ing the administrative branch of
the University a full set of rooms.
The Geology laboratory will change
its quarters to the rooms formerly
occupied by the departments of
Physiology, Zoology, and Chemis
try. The removal of these depart
ments allows a much larger and
better equipped set of rooms for the
Geology students.
The old freshman Chemistry
laboratory will pass into the hands
of Dr. Snow. The offices of the
Hygiene department, which found
a temporary home there last semes
ter, will be permanently located in
this building. The Education de
partment has been transferred to
the rooms before occupied by the
Physical laboratory, and in the
same building Applied Mathemat
ics will lie located in the old Bot
any rooms. The Department of
German remains undisturbed in its
old quarters, but the Classical
Languages will take the rooms
vacated by the English and Eco
nomics recitation rooms. Pure
Mathematics will remain in the
old quarters, and the arrangement
of the Law department will suffer
no change.
The outer quad buildings of the
front facade which were completed
last year will all be occupied this
semester. To the left of the Arch
the Departments of Psychology,
Zoology, and Physiology will lie
located. The corner building will
house the offices of the General and
Systematic Botany departments, as
well as those of Psychology. Next
to the Arch the I'hysiology rooms
are located, while the larger build
ing between the two will be given
over to Zoology laboratories. To
the right of the Arch, the corner
building next to the Library will
be held by the Departments of His
tory, English, and Economics, with
their offices and lecture-rooms. Im
mediately behind the old English
offices a new building has been put
into shape for the Department of
Romanic Languages. The Me
chanical and Electrical Engineer
ing departments remain in their
new quarters, and the rooms of the
Civil Engineering department re
main unchanged. The brick lab
oratory will be devoted entirely to
shops for wood-turning and pattern
making, the entire Physics depart
ment being located in the new
Science buildings, where the De
partment ot Entomology also finds
new quarters.
There has been much more liber
ality in the assignment of space for

office room, and none of the depart
ments that will occupy new quar
ters this year are in any way
crowded. The work on the other
buildings of the outer quad has not
been finished during the summer,
hut by next semester a completed
chain of structures will probably
have been erected.
