Evkry retiring editorof the Daily
Palo Alto lias cheerfully acknowl
edged that there is chance for serious
improvement in the conduct of this
paper. That great strides have
been made in the last few years
may be directly traced to the per
sistence and untiring devotion of
editors-in-chief who have seen in
their work a duty to fulfill. Numer
ous changes have been proposed
and executed, while others have
failed of reaching maturity because
the time was unpropitious. Im
provement has come about through
the sincere belief of the editors that
there is a certain position for a
university paper to occupy. Every
semester the paper has been moved
up. There are two places a college
daily must fill: First, it must print
all the news pertaining to the univer
sity; and second, it should be the
organ of the student body, repre
senting their opinions on all ques
tions that may arise. The latter
condition will be reached, and the
paper will be more consistently and
completely the mouthpiece of the
students, when both work in the
greatest harmony. When this con
dition is brought about, every ed
itorial view of the paper will be
regarded as the sentiment of the
student body, and no detailed sym
posium will be necessary to obtain
the position of the students, as has
not infrequently been the case.
The field of news-gathering can be
more satisfactorily bettered by in
creasing the facilities. Certain
changes are to be made in the com
petition for the staff which it is
confidently expected will go far
towards attaining the desired solu
tion. Heretofore the staff has been
a flexible one. While elections to
the board depended on a certain
length of service, no limit has been
placed on the number of associates
and assistants. Those who served
the required time and showed
inclination to work up, were put on
the staff. In a word, there has been

no severe competition, since every
candidate was made to believe that
lie would lie eventually elected to
the hoard anyway. There has been
no incentive to extra individual
work besides the candidate's own
love and interest in the work. The
belief is now predominant among
the editors that the time has come
for a tightening up of the competi
tion. It is the hope of those in
control that the trials for this staff
will sooner or later reach the close
ness and the intensity of certain
eastern college dailies. To this end
places on the staff will be limited.
There will be a certain number of
vacancies open to "heelers," and
those doing the best work will re
ceive the elections at the end of the
chosen time. Elections will be
based on the quantity and quality
of the material that each candidate
gets published, and to the end that
padding may not be the greatest
inducement, a quality test will be
putin force. In addition, to en
courage original work and to more
fully cover the news field, full credit
will he given for original news that
is published, and one-half credit
for assigned work. It is the hope
that two results will be reached by
this change : First, to better the
nevvs-gatheri ng faci li ties of the paper
by increasing the competition; and
second, to make a position 011 the
staff mean as much as it does on
the Yale JS J eivs or the Harvard Crim
son.
