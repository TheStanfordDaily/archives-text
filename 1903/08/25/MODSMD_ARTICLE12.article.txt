# RESIGNS CONTROL.
## Management of University Placed in Hands of Board of Trustees. 
### 
Mrs. Stanford has taken the step
which she has been contemplating
for a somewhat extended period of
time. During the summer she sur
rendered to the Hoard of Trustees
the power of administration that
she has exercised over the Univer
sity since Senator Stanford's death.
Under the new regime a position
on the board will he no longer a
nominal one, but will carry with
it heavy administrative duties.
Mrs. Stanford's surrender of power
was complete, the control of the
University being as entirely in the
hands of the trustees at present as
it has been in the hands of the
founder hitherto. As soon as was
practicable a meeting of the board
was held, when Mrs. Stanford was
unanimously elected president, a
position from which Hon. S. F.
Lieb resigned in her honor. Al
though no radical changes of policy
are looked for as a result of the
change in control, in several mat
ters of minor importance the
trustees were advised to take new
positions. Power of faculty ap
pointment was taken out of the
hands of the president and placed
in the hands of the board. Mrs.
Stanford suggested that the busi
ness and charitable features of the
University be entirely separated,
and in addition outlined her policy
in regard to control of Memorial
Church.
