# RECEIVERS FOR INN.
## Student Eating Club in Financial Trouble.â€”Bondsmen Temporarily Have Control. 
### 
The Stanford University Inn
opened at noon today. Owing to
financial difficulties it has been
placed in the hands of the bonds
men of the Inn Club, who are Doc
tors Branner and Elliott and Profes
sors Allardice, Griffin, and Green.
The bondsmen assume temporary
control of the Inn through lease of
the club. The debt of the Inn Club
amounts to about $'2500.
The fact of a possible shortage in
the financial status of the Inn Club
was first brought to the notice of
the bondsmen about the first of
June, when manager Hunter, to
gether with Mr. George Adderson,
was asked to take an inventory of
the Inn; but Mr. Hunter failed to
putin an appearance. Correspond
ence was at once opened with certain
members of the Inn Club, but no
one was found who was willing to
represent the club in taking an in
ventory. About August Ist the
business office of the University
asked the bondsmen to name some
one who might represent them in
that capacity. Mr. Strowbridge, a
former manager of the Inn, was
chosen, and lie with Mr. George
Adderson completed the inventory,
which showed that there was a
shortage of about $200 in the prop
erty of the club, caused by losses
and breakage. The bondsmen then
began to look more carefully into
the financial condition of the Inn
and found outstanding debts of $2,-
300, bringing the total indebtedness
up to the sum of $2500. The club
owns property in silver and linen
worth about $900, but in all prob
ability this could not be sold for more
than half that amount, which sum
would represent the total assets of
the Inn.
Under these conditions the Uni
versity would not renew the lease
to the Inn Club. Accordingly the
bondsmen have undertaken to run
the eating-house for the benefit of
students and creditors, and will
conduct it until the financial status
is brought to a condition where the
members may again renew the
lease and conduct the club them
selves.
