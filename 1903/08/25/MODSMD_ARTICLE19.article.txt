# Must Report to Committee.
## 
### 
A notice from the President's
oflice was posted yesterday to the
effect that hereafter each student

organization having control of
funds must make reports of its
financial operations, in accordance
with prescribed rules and forms, to
the University Committee on Stu
dent Affairs.
This action was found necessary
on account of the recent failure of
the Inn Club. All the different
student organizations are affected
by the new rule. Not only will
the Inn Club be obliged to make
monthly reports, but also the As
sociated Students, class organiza
tions, literary societies, and all
others which may have under their
charge the disbursement of funds.
