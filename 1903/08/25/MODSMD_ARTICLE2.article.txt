# REGISTRATION FEES.
## New Rule Made by Trustees in Case of Non-Resident Students. 
### 
Action in regard to the mooted
question of California residence has
at last been taken by the Board of
Trustees of the University. The
new rule is more severe than that
under the lax application of the
last two years. The following no
tice was issued from the President's
oflice yesterday:
The Board of Trustees have di
rected that students shall be regis
tered from the place from which
they originally enter the Univer
sity; that is, a man cannot gain or
lose his residence by entering a
school. Only those students should
be regarded as residents of Califor
nia who were originally registered
from that state. The following is
their resolution covering this mat
ter: "That all students not having
lived in the State of California for
at least one year before their first
registration as students shall be
presumed to be non-residents so
long as they may remain connected
with the University as students;
that this regulation applies to old
as well as to new students. That
the Treasurer of the University
shall collect the registration fees
before the registration of students."
In case any injustice arises from
this ruling, the proper remedy is to
be obtained by presenting his case
in the form of a petition to the
Board of Trustees, which will con
j sider the matter, in the case of stu
' dents wishing to enter for the com
ing year, at its meeting on August
j 29th. David S. Jordan,
President.
