# Dormitories Filling Up.
## 
### 
All the rooms in both Encina
and Roble halls are reported as
taken. While not all are occupied
as vet, no vacant ones are unen
gaged. Up to noon today, one
hundred and ninety had registered
at Encina. There is already a long
waiting list for rooms in Roble. A
change has taken place at Encina
this year in abolishing the system
of student policemen and engaging
a regular watchman.
