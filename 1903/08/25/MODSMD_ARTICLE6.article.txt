# NEW ENGINEERING PROFESSOR.
## George H. Rowe of Colorado University to be Associate in Electrical Department. 
### 
One of the most important re
cent appointments to the faculty
is that of George H. Rowe, who ar
rived at the University today to
become associate professor in the
Department of Electrical Engi
neering. Ue comes directly from
the University of Colorado, where
he held the rank of dean of the
school of applied science and pro
fessor of electrical engineering.
Professor Rowe has had a wide
experience along his line of work,
and also is the possessor of an ex
tended professional record. He
graduated from the University of
Michigan in 1891, with the degree
of Bachelor of .Sciences. He spent
one semester in study at Cornell
during 1890, and one summer
with the Fort Wayne, Indiana,
Electrical Company, testing me
ters and making iron tests. He
did research work at the Universi
ty of Chicago during the summer
semester, and in 1890-91 was ap
pointed assistant in physics at the
University of Michigan, where he
was made instructor for the two
years following.
During the summer of 1892 Pro
fessor Rowe traveled abroad, visit
ing the larger laboratories in
Europe. On his return he was
appointed to the chair of physics
at the University of Colorado. He
held this position until 1895 and
was then given the chair in
electrical engineering, which he
resigned to come to Stanford.
In 1901 Professor Rowe was given
the additional position of dean of
applied science at Colorado.
Part of the new faculty mem
ber's practical experience consists
of laying out the electrical designs
of -about one hundred fly-wheel
alternators ; recalculating induc
tion motors, paying particular at
tention to reactance formulae ;
and acting as consulting engineer
for various towns and companies.
