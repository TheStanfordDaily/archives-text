# FOOTBALL TO START TUESDAY
## Outline of Prospects for Season. Eight Varsity Men Return. 
### 
Next Monday afternoon Coach
Lanagan and Captain Bansbach
will issue a call to all men who
expect to play football during the:
coming season. Both old and new
men are expected to turn out for the
first practice, which will take place
Tuesday. Lanagan arrived today
and Slaker will be here to assist on
September Ist.
Of the old Varsity players eight
have returned: Hauverman, '04,
center; Thompson, '04, guard on
1902 Varsity; Sprott, '06, tackle;
Clark, '04, end; Bansbach, '04,
captain and quarter; Dole, '05, and
Tarpey, '05, halves; McGilvray,'o4,
fullback. Lee and Barnhisel,
guards, are both gone; McFadden
from tackle and Bartell from end.
Of the most likely of the substitutes
and Second Team men to try for the
vacant position are Shields, '04,
Butterfield, '04, Wilbur, '05, Jacobs,
'04, Hyde, '04, and Christy, '04.
While the loss of so many old
men is always discouraging, there
remains the better feature that a
season of close competition among
new men and the substitutes of the
preceding year eliminates the fre
quent disastrous feeling of overcon
fidence and the idea of a "place
cinched," which a team of veterans
is liable to have.
As to the material that has
entered with the class of 1907,
little can be conjectured at this
early date. The class is large and
contains a good many big men
who no doubt have had valuable
football experience. Nevertheless
no sound prediction as to the mer
its of the Freshman players can be
made until they have put forth
their efforts in actual practice.
The '07 men who have been most
frequently spoken of as having a
fair chance to represent their class
against California freshmen, are
Heffron, tackle iron) Salt Lake
City ; Stott, quarter from the Port
land Academy ; Blood, from San
Diego ; Chalmers, halfback from
the Portland Academy ; McLain,
an end from Los Angeles High ;
and Kellogg.
The annual Stanford â€”California
intercollegiate game will be played
November 14th, on the Richmond
ground in San Francisco. This
date was agreed upon last week by
managers DeCoto of California
and Cowden of Stanford. The
first game of the season will be
held on the campus September
19th between the Freshman team
and either the UDiversity of the Pa
cific or the Santa Clara College
eleven. The larger preliminary
games for the Varsity will be with
the University of Oregon and the
University of Nevada. The date
for the Nevada game is October 24th.
Oregon will have the last of the
practice games on November 7th.
These visiting teams will also meet
California, Oregon October 31st,
and Nevada November 7th. The
date of the intercollegiate Fresh
men game is not yet set, but the
contest will take place on the Stan
ford campus, as will all the minor
Varsity games.

Plans are being made to place
three separate club teams in the
field and offer practice games for
the two university elevens. "Pete"
Smith is reorganizing the Olympic
team, and Gaffney is rustling men
for the Reliance Club squad. A
California alumni team will be
putin the field by Gendotti and
Castlehun, two former California
players. There is also a fair
probability of a Stanford Alumni
aggregation under the manage
ment J. T. Nourse, '00.
As yet no requests for games
have come to Manager Cowden
from Eastern colleges.
