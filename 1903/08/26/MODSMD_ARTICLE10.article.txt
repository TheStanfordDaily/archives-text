### 
Fourteen hundred bound vol
umes have been received at the
University Library and distributed
on the shelves during the past three
months. A more convenient ar
rangement of the stacks lias been
made, and considerable progress
toward the completion of the new
typewritten card catalogue has
been effected.
The most notable of the new
books that have been recently ac
quired is the valuable civil engi
neering library formerly owned by
the late J. \V. F. Conrad, chief di
rector of water-works in Holland.
The collection is one of the rarest
in existence on that particular
branch of engineering which has to
do with waterways and dikes. It
consists of over seventeen hundred
bound volumes and pamphlets,
some of which date back aB far as
1590. The library contains all the
original works of J. \V. F. Conrad
and his father, who was also among
the foremost of Dutch civil engi
neers. An extremely valuable di
vision of the collection is a group
of thirty-five large portfolios con
taining charts, maps and photo
graphs of the canals and dikes of
Holland. The greater part of the
new acquisition is written in Dutch
and the remainder in French. The
subjects noted most extensively
are rivers, dikes, floods, coast lights,
foreign canals, steam and wind
mills, embankments, drainage,
railways and tramways, sluices
and bridges, dredging and public
works in the Netherlands and East
India.
Another valuable addition to the
Library is a complete set of the pro
ceedings of the Sinnean Scientific
Society of New South Wales. This
collection consists of seventy-five
volumes, and is the gift of the Hon.
Thomas Welton Stanford of Aus
tralia.
