# Professor Ramsey Resigns.
## 
### 
On account of ill health Assist
ant Professor M. M. Ramsey of
the Spanish department has re
signed. Professor Ramsey's health
failed last semester and he was
compelled to give up his classes.
He has only slightly improved and
is not strong enough to resume his
work. He has given up teaching
for the present. Arrangements for
carrying on his courses are being
conducted by Dr. Matzke of the
Romanic Languages department,
but no definite announcement can
be made for several days.
Professor Ramsey came to Stan
ford from John Hopkins Universi
ty in the fall of 1901 to take charge
[of the work in Spanish.
