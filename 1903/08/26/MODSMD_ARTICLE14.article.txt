The announcement that the first
football practice is to be held on
the campus Tuesday will be re
ceived with genuine enthusiasm.
This early beginning of the season's
work will do much to put hope and
confidence in the ultimate success
of the eleven that represents Stan
ford in the coming Intercol
legiate game. There is every
reason for gratification [in the
outlook. With eight Varsity men
returning to the University, the
gloomy prospects that arose at the
close of last year are easily dis
pelled, and nothing foretells a suc
cessful season better than the con
fidence that is held in Captain
Bansbach's ability to lead the
Cardinal to victory. The first big
rally of the year will be held in
Encina Monday night, and it is
needless to say that every Stanford
man will take part in this initial
gathering of the year. Confidence
is held in the men who have charge
of the candidates, and it now rests
with every entering student who
has ever played football to turn out
for hard work. A hundred men
should be on the field Tuesday.
