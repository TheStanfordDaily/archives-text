Experience of past years has
shown that there is a tendency
among certain students at this
University to avoid paying the
student body assessment. Al
though more assessments than
usual have been paid this year,
there have been any number of
students who refused to pay the
customary fee yesterday and
today. The sentiment of the
men and women who show
their college spirit by deeds
instead of words is entirely
against this attitude of selfishness
and indifference. The semester as
sessment of one dollar is ridiculous
ly small when compared with the
tax levied in other colleges. And yet
it is of vital importance that this
assessment be promptly and unan
imously paid. As is the case every
year, there is a large deficit on the
books of the student body, entailed

necessarily by the heavy expense
of baseball and track. Until the
receipts from the football season
come in the student body will be
helplessly without funds except
those obtained by the Bemester
assessment. The alternative of
borrowing money at a high rate
of interest is too objectionable to
face. In order that the treasurer
shall not be obliged to work with
tied hands at this season when the
outlay is very heavy, it should be
considered a point of personal
honor that every student pay his
assessment. Last year in the case
of the Student Guild there was an
example of what helplessness may
result from laxity in money obli
gations of a moral nature alone.
While exactly similiar circum
stances will never arise through
failure to pay a student body as
sessment, the moral obligation is
just as strong and the results of
selfishness as crippling to student
body activities. It is the strong
feeling of those closely interested
in the success of the student body
that no one through selfishness,
indifference or carelessness should
allow the matter to slip. There
are few students who can honestly
say that the assessment is too
heavy an expense for them to meet.
