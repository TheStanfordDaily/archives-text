# Department of Philosophy.
## 
### 
For the present, owing to the res
ignation last semester of Dr. C. H.
Rieber, the Department of Philos
ophy will be discontinued, but stu
dents who have that as their major
are reporting to Dr. Angell of the
Psychology department. It is
probable that some man of note
will be appointed to the vacancy at
the head of the department be
fore Christmas. Dr. Rieber, who
formerly gave the courses in Logic
and Philosophy, began his work
this month at the University of
California, where he received his
A. B. in 1888.
