### 
Work has proceeded on the mo
saics in Memorial Church all sum
mer. The front is now completed.
Four new figures, representing
Faith, Hope, Love, and Charity,
have been added. Inside, the art
ists are now at work on a number
of new mosaics. On the left are to
be ten pictures from the Old Testa
ment. Among these are "The Wis
dom of Solomon," "Solomon's Tem
ple," and"The Wrath of Saul,"
On the right are to be ten pictures
from the New Testament. It is in
tended to place above the organ a
blue sky effect in mosaic, with gold
stars and white clouds. It will
probably be eight or ten months
before the work is completed.
