If there is one thing that im
presses visitors as being a distinct
ive characteristic of this institu
tion, it is the seeming absolute
regard which all the students hold
for the University property. There
is very little defacing of buildings
or their surroundings. In contrast
with the prevailing custom at
other colleges, where wanton de
struction goes on at this time of
the year when the two under
classes are continually striving for
supremacy, the careful refraining
on the part of all Stanford students
from any acts of depredation is a
fitting testimonial of the reverence
for the Founders that pervades the
entire undergraduate body. It
should be constantly remembered
in these first days when the paint
brush could be used to such de
facement in order to flaunt the
class numerals, that the feeling of
everyone at the University is al
ways opposed to any marring of
University property. There are
plenty of opportunities for display
ing class enthusiasm, without re
sorting to acts that stamp their
perpetrators as ungrateful of the
great liberality of the Founders.
