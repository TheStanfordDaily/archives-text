The feeling of temporary dissat
isfaction aroused by the new rule
requiring that every manager of a
student organization in whose
hands is placed the disbursement
of funds shall make a monthly
report to the faculty committee
has in a large measure worn off.
Thoughtful undergraduates have
come to recognize that student
organizations, whose membership is
constantly changing, should not be
permitted to contract heavy debts,
the burden of which, if they are
ever paid, must fall upon some
innocent peraon. When it is gen
erally accepted that a university
has the right to withhold its diplo
ma from a student who has con
tracted debts he cannot pay, an
•xtension of that right, so that by
personal supervision a body of
students may be prevented from

contracting bad debts, should not
be disputed. The feeling that the
University is stepping in to an
unwarranted degree should not be
held. Certainly there is nothing
unwarranted in taking a step that
will preserve the financial upright
ness of the Btudents and so, indi
rectly, the financial standing of
the University itself.
