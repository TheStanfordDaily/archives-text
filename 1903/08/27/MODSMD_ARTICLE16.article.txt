# TABLETS IN MUSEUM.
## Trustee Thomas Welton Stanford Presents Rare Collection of Assyrian Relics. 
### 
During the summer months the
Museum has been the recipient of
a very valuable collection of Assy
rian and Babylonian tablets. The
Honorable Thomas Welton Stan
ford of Australia is the donor, and
his gift is one of great intrinsic
value as well as of great advantage
to local students and archeologists
throughout the country. Mr.
Stanford was very fortunate to
have obtained possession of the
collection, as their extreme age
makes them exceedingly rare.
The tablets are far from being
examples of the perfected art that
some of the late Egyptian cylin
ders illustrate, but are of interest
because of the messages they bring
from the dead world. In the terse
words of the Assyrian and Baby
lonian wise men facts of great his
torical interest have been discovered.
The history of the invasion of Asia
Minor by Cyrus is told, almost with
out break,by the cuneiform charac
ters. Other tablets speak of the
Hittite war when the Assyrians
began the conquest which resulted
in the capture of Jerusalem. The
wording of the tablets is very
quaint.
The process of manufacture was
in keeping with the time. The
fine clays of Asia Minor were
moulded in specially prepared flat
surfaces while still soft. Upon
these soft surfaces the artists either
scratched their inscriptions or
modelled their base-reliefs. To
preserve the characters intact an
intense heat was applied so that
the baking process resulted in a
tablet as hard as flint and practi
cally impervious to the effects of
age. The tablets are important
because of their historic interest
and of the insight into the life of
the ancient peoples that they al
low. Scenes of the war or of the
hunt are depicted in a rude way,
while great stress is laid upon
their national pastime, lion hunt
ing, sport of the Assyrian kings.
Curator Harry Peterson states
that the tablets have attracted the
attention of scholars throughout
the country. Many prominent
archeologists have visited the col
lection and spent a length of time
in study, while those men who
have been too far distant to visit
the collection in person have held
communication with him about
the new acquisition of the museum.
