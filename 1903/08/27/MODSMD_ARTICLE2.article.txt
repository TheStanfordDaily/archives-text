# NEW FOOTBALL RULES.
## Regulations That Will Make the Game Less Rough and More Spectacular. 
### 
Several sweeping alterations in
the football code have been made
by the Intercollegiate Football
Rules committee at a conference
held during the summer. Not
since the abolition of the famous
flying wedge have changes been
made that so materially alter the
style of play as does the new set of
regulations which was announced
only after four sessions of spirited
debate between the famous football
experts who compose the committee.
The men to whom the changes are
due are: John C. Bell, Pennsyl
vania; Prof. 11. B. Fine, Princeton;
Walter Camp, Yale; R. D. Wrenn,
Harvard; Professor Dennis, Cor
nell: and Paul D. Dashiel, Lehigh.
In considering new rules the idea
of the committee was to reach a
set of regulations that would elim
inate from football as much as
possible the rough and brutal ele
ment that has caused so much pro
test against the game. How well
they have succeeded in this regard
can be determined only by practi
cal tests on the field. However,
one thing is certain to follow the
new code, and that is that in the
future there will be much more
individual and spectacular playing
of the kind that appeals to the
bleachers and the spectator not
versed in the fine points of the game
The most important of the new
rules and the one that will do
most to bring about the ideas of
the rules committee is that abolish
ing mass plays by diminishing the
presence of seven men in the line
of scrimmage. This does away
with the famous plays of "guards
back," "tackles back," and like
formations. Only the quarter, the
halves and the fullback are to
be behind the line while the play
is infield, which means that the
advancement of the ball will rest
entirely with the four backs.

This year the seven-men rule
will he enforced only when the ball
is in the center of the field, within
the space hounded hy the twenty
five yard lines. When a team is
on the defensive and within twenty
five yards of its own goal, it may
play according to the rules of 1902.
Likewise when on the offensive and
within twenty-five yards of the
opponent's goal the rules of 1902
may he brought into service. But
in the large territory in the middle
of the field, seven men must be
continually in the rush line. This
combination of the rules used in
the early eighties with those of
1902 give an admirable opportunity
for a comparison of the two schemes
as well as a chance to see the inter
esting points of the close rush
work and the thrilling plays
afforded by an open field.
The second change of importance
allows the quarterback to advance
the ball. In the future he will not
only act as "middleman," passing
the ball to the other backs, but will
run with it himself. In order to
prevent the quarter from plunging
into the line and making a rapid
mass play it is required that in
moving forward with the ball he
must run at least five yards on
either side of the center. This
necessitates the marking of the
field with five-yard longitudinal
lines as well as crosswise in order
that the officials may determine
whether the quarter covers his
lateral ground.
Minor changes were made as
follows: The fullback can no longer
put his teammates "on side" after
a punt by running ahead of the
ball; a penalty of twenty yards'
loss to the team guilty of holding,
but not the losb of the ball, as was
the case last year. Nothing was
done relative to foul tackles among
the players, as the 1902 regulations
if enforced were considered suffi
ciently thorough on that point.
John C. Hell, district attorney of
Philadelphia, is responsible for the
rule allowing the quarter-back to
run with the ball. Speaking of the
probable effects of the application
of the new play, he is quoted as
saying:
"I think the rules will do a
world of good in 'opening' up the
game. There will be more punting
and more running. The public
which sees the game will certainly
be better pleased, and I think the
play will he faster and more inter
esting to the football men them
selves. Anyhow, the rules, under
the arrangement of having the old
style game inside the twenty-five
yard line, will have a good trying
out, and will be continually com
pared in actual play with the
former regulations under all the
varying conditions of an entire
season."
