### 
Very few applications have been
received at the Y. W. C. A. labor
bureau for work. Mrs. O. L. Elli
ott, who is in charge of the bureau,
reports that a fewer number of
young women have applied this
year than ever before, notwith
standing that there are more appli
cations for girls than at any other
time.
