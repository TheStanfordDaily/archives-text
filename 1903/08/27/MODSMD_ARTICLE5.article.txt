## Dr. Jordan Visits Northern Waters During Summer for U.S. Government. 
### 
President David Starr Jordan
spent six weeks of the summer va
cation as head of the committee
charged with the investigation of
salmon fisheries throughout Alas
kan waters. Under his direction,
the scientists working in different
sections carried out the instructions
of the United States Fish Commis
sion, paying special attention to
the matter of hatcheries and their
legal regulation.
The expedition left Seattle June
30th on the Fish Commission steam
er Alhatross, after making a series
of experimental dredges off Fort
Flagler. Among those from Stan
ford were Dr. C. H. Gilbert, Dr.
Harold Heath, H. M. Spaulding,
and D. R. Rutter, all of the Zoolo
gy department. These men are to
return to the University about
September 15th.
A preliminary report has been
prepared by Dr. Jordan, but it
will not be sent to Washington un
til the return of the other members
of the expedition. In general, it
will report a prosperous condition
of affairs in the North. It will
recommend that the fisheries be
placed under control of expert men
who may act free from political
influence, and that hatcheries be
established throughout the Alaskan
country.
According to Commissioner Bow
ers, "this is the most important
expedition ever sent out by the
Commission, and the information
obtained will assist materially in
developing Alaska's fisheries."
