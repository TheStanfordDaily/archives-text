# AN AVERAGE REGISTRATION.
## Figures Taken at Noon Show No Exceptional Enrollment of Students. 
### 
The registration at noon today
had reached a total of one thou
sand one hundred and thirty-one.
As yet no figures relative to the
registration of graduate students
can be secured. In all probability
a grand total of those already
registered, graduate students, and
students late in registering, will
not reach the one thousand two
hundred and fifty mark, which was
exceeded last year on the Monday
following registration day. Of
those registered up to date seven
hundred and seventy are old stu
dents and three hundred and sixty
one are freshmen. The figures
of last year show that during three
days of registration the class of
1906 enrolled four hundred and
thirty-one new students. The fall
ing off in numbers that the class
of 1907 has experienced is altogeth
er unexpected, as conservative esti
mates given out before college
opened had led people to expect
a record breaking class. There has
been a much stricter ruling in re
gard to doubtful entrance credits
this term, with the result that a
number of men from the prepara
tory schools have not been accepted.
The registration of women is
well within the five hundred mark,
a total of four hundred and thirty
one having been granted admis
sion. There are in addition forty
five to whom "first papers" have
been granted who will probably
be able to satisfy requirements and
gain admission. There seems lit
tle chance that the Freshman class
will prove a record breaker or the
total registration reach a new high
water mark unless the number of
graduate students and those who
delayed in entering is unusually
large.
