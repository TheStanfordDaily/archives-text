# Work on New Gymnasium.
## 
### 
Operations on the new gymna
sium started again recently after
a considerable delay during the
summer owing to trouble with
the stonemasons and iron workers.
Two strikes were declared by these
men, and progress on the structure
has been considerably delayed.
The stonemasons have begun work
on the south wall, and will soon be
ready for the carpenters, who are
expected to rush the work on the
second floor.
