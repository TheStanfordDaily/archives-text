Editor Daily I'alo Alto:
We desire to inform all persona
interested in the changes to be in
augurated in the management of
the Y. M. C. A. Student Employ
ment Bureau.
We plan to post on the quad
and in Palo Alto daily bulletins of
applications from employers and to
fill such positions as we can. In
case of inability to fill all demands
we intend to notify applicants that
no men are available. This sys
tem is advantageous in that it will
obviate the necessity of seeking for
men who are often too busy to ac
cept a job when offered. It will be
taken for granted that men who
make application for work at
stated times will guarantee to take
any position that is offered them.
We think it advisable to send
out only such men as we can
recommend to be efficient. Abso
lute impartiality towards both stu
dent and employer will be strictly
adhered to in the work of our
bureau. The bureau will also re
frain from interfering between stu
dents and employers in regard to
hours, wages and other matters.
The temporary office of the Em
ployment Bureau is located in the
old Chemistry building (room 60).
The office hours are from 8:15 to
9:15 on days of instruction and
from 11:15 to 12:20 on Saturday.
Applicationsfrom employers should
be made two days in advance; com
munications through the mail will
be promptly acknowledged.
