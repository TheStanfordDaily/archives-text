So much was paid last year re
garding late arrivals at the church
services and University lectures
that further comment seems alto
gether unnecessary. But last Sun
day such flagrant violations of
ordinary courtesy in this respect
were noticeable that it is only in
justice to the congregation and the
minister that attention be drawn
to those who still persist in reach
ing the pews fifteen and thirty
minutes late. The noise that ac
companies their tardy entrance not
only disturbs those in the church
but also destroys the sanctity and
harmony of the worship. Those
who occasionally find it impossible
to arrive at the proper hour could
avoid undue annoyance by quietly
occupying rear pews instead of pro
ceeding to the extreme front.
