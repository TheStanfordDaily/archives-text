# "Sequoia" Appears Monday.
## 
### 
The first number of the Sequoia,
under the editorship of Miss Irene
A. Wright, '04, will appear Mon
day. In appearance the magazine
has not changed from last year,
and the policy as announced edito
rially is the same—"to he a literary
magazine representative of Stan
ford interests and Stanford ability."

The leading article, "The Medi
aeval Freshman," its somewhat dif
ferent from what has hitherto
appeared in the Sequoia. It aims
to take the place of the stilted
essay once characteristic of the
older magazines. The introduc
tion of this feature is the leading
innovation of the year. During
the year each number will contain
an article of a similar nature, on a
topic of interest to students.
In the way of fiction there are
two stories, "In the Matter of a
Pin," by Miss Helen Lamson, '04,
and "McLauren'e Idea," by Miss
Edith Mirrielees, '06; and a short
sketch, "On the Behavior of
Recruits," by F. H. Fowler, '04.
"The Call," by D. M. Reynolds,
'05, and"After Long Years," by
H. L., constitute the features in
verse.
Herbert F. Coolidge, '04, dis
cusses the problem of the working
student, in an authoritative article
on "Student Labor," and Trainer
Moulton writes hopefully of the
athletic outlook.
An exchange department will
appear under the caption "Shear
Steal." This branch will alternate
with another called "The Book-
Table," dealing with non-collegiate
publications in so far as they con
tain matter of interest to Stanford
men and women. Both these de
partments are revivals from former
volumes of the Sequoia.
As announced at the close of last
semester, Professor Ramsey, late of
the Spanish department, has offered
a prize of five dollars for the best
article of fifteen hundred words in
Spanish, preferably fiction, to be
submitted by an undergraduate.
Professor Griffin of the department
of German has duplicated this offer
with reference to an article in Ger
man. The exact date of the con
test has yet to be announced, but
it will come sometime this fall, and
will be in charge of F. H. Fowler,
'04.
