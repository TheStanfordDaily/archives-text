# The
						University Band.
## 
### 
M. H. Thorpe, '05, director of the
University Band, will soon issue a
call to all men in the University
who have had previous experience
in bands or who have Bome knowl
edge of band instruments. Sev
eral of last year's band men grad
uated and some others have not
returned to college. This leaves a
number of vacancies to be filled by
freshmen.
The band management will
probably arrange for monthly
dances to be given during the year
to raise money to remove the
small indebtedness on instruments
already purchased as well as to
purchase further equipment.
