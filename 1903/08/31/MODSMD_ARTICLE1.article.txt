# FIRST PRACTICE TOMORROW.
## Gridiron and Grounds in Readiness for the Initial Football Work. 
### 
The distribution of football suits
will be made at Treasurer Cowden's
office tomorrow during the entire
day and the men who sign up at
the rally tonight will be expected
to be on the oval ready for the
direction of Coaches Lanagan and
Slaker at four o'clock in the after
noon.
Treasurer Cowden is having the
grounds, fences and bleachers of
the oval completely overhauled and
putin perfect repair for the com
ing season. The gridiron has
been thoroughly harrowed and will
soon receive a coating of sawdust.
Treasurer Cowden intends to put on
a light covering of sawdust at differ
ent times during the season rather
than a heavy coat at first, which
made the field slow all during last
year's practice.
The bleachers which were moved
to the baseball diamond will be
left there this year, as the 6eats re
maining on the oval are sufficient
for all games except possibly
the Intercollegiate Freshman, for
which, if need be, additional bleach
ers will be erected.
The most noticeable of the late
improvements are the new rubbing
rooms built adjacent to the track
near the main entrance. With a
number of student rubbers who are
well able to care for football men,
and convenient shower baths, the
players will receive more prompt
attention just as they come from
the field.
The present outlook for practice
and preliminary football games
points to a season of unusual in
terest on the campus oval. Already
the Reliance club management of
San Francisco is gathering up a
squad of about thirty-five old
varsity and club players to be
captained by Atkinson and man
aged by Smith and Hamilton.
This aggregation will be stronger
than ever this year and will put up
a close fight with the Varsity.
An eleven headed by Castlehun,
a former California tackle, and
drawn largely from the national
guard, will also enter into a compe
tition with the two university
teams for several preliminary
games. These teams, together with
the strong line-ups that will come
from Nevada and Oregon, will
afford the occupants of the cam
pus bleachers a most interesting
season.
Reports from California seem to
indicate that the state university
will start the season under highly
favorable conditions. California
loses from her 1902 eleven three
men, Mini, Albertson and Sher
man. These places will probably
be filled from last year's second
eleven and Freshman team, promi
nent in which were Cogan, Pel nap,
Gillis, Riley, Muther, Force, More,
Clark, Sabin and Middleton.
The California line of last year
has returned almost solid with
Stroud, center; Overall, guard;
Stow, guard; Howard, tackle; Heit
muller, tackle; and Demerit!, end.
So far Reliance is the only team
trying to arrange a tour outside

the state. The managers of the
club team are trying to perfect
arrangements for a series of holi
day games with the Multnomah
cluh of Portland, and Chemawa
Indian teams in Oregon, as well as
a Thanksgiving trip to Nevada
and possibly one through the South
ern part of California.
