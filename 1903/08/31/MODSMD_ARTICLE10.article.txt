The construction on the campus
of an office building for the Sequoia,
Chaparral, and Quad is interesting
in the light of what the future may
have to offer for all the Stanford
publications. On account of cer
tain regulations governing the pur
poses of the University buildings,
the plan to have the offices in the
basement of the new History, Eng
lish, and Economics building had
to be surrendered at the last mo
ment. The time may be not so
very far distant when each of the
University papers, together with
others doing work along special
lines, will find homes in a perma
nent structure, which will be locat
ed in a place convenient and pub
lic enough to make it a center of
University information. The pres
ent location of the Daii.y Palo
Alto office prevents the establish
ment of any bulletin board service.
The lack of facilities for furnishing
telegraphic news of importance is
most deeply felt during the progress
of athletic and debating contests in
which the Varsity teams are par
ticipants off the campus. Un
doubtedly this paper will some
day be located where such
bulletin service could be fur
nished. Aside from this advanta
geous feature there is the influence
such a permanent home would have
in strengthening the different pa
pers by creating a permanent
center of interest not only for those
on the boards of the different
papers but for other students as
well.
