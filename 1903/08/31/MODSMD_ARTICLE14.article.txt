Ruble gymnasium opens with a
larger freshman claps than before.
The total registration from 1907
has reached 81. Of the old stu
dents only 107 have registered. In
the leaders' class there are 15. The
11:15 class is composed entirely of
freshmen. The other classes are
open only to students who have
had previous gymnasium training,
allowing more room for advanced
work.
This year special stress will be
laid on outdoor athletics, and be
sides the regular tennis and basket
ball, hockey and handball will be
introduced.
The assistants to Miss Stella
Itose this year are Miss F. R. Gar
diner, Miss M. Horr, Miss Chloe
Anderson, and Miss Townsend.
As fÂ«tr as possible a uniform suit
of black serge has been adopted.
This is the only change over last
year.
A class for those interested in
gymnasium work but not wishing
to register has been started on
Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4:30.
Anyone is eligible to this class,
whether a University student or
not. No credit will be given for
this class.
