# DR. HOFFMEYR PREACHES.
## Tells of Lessons He Derived from Visit to the Yosemite Valley. 
### 
The sermon Sunday morning in
Memorial Church was delivered by
Dr. Adrian Hoffmeyr of the Dutch
Reformed Church in South Africa.
He took as his text 1 Samuel, 9:27:
"Stand thou still awhile, that I
may show thee the word of the
Lord."
Dr. Hoffmeyr said that he merely
intended to give a heart to heart
talk of things that had been forci
bly impressed upon him by his
stay in this country. He recently
visited the Yosemite Valley, and
that was the Samuel that had
called to him. He went on to de
scribe the sensations that came to
him as he stood on Inspiration
Point and gazed on the matchless
scene that lay before him. Just as
the forces of primeval nature had
battled there and had left as a
result a work of surpassing beauty,
so did the soul, straining mightily
against heavy odds, rise at last to
a higher plane of beauty and peace.
His hearers were exhorted to
stand on an Inspiration Point of
their own and obey the voice that
comes to them. One must climb
slowly and painfully from the
depths and darkness to light and
peace. Doubts and misgivings are
to be settled, not by argument and
wrangling, but by love. "First
the cross and then the crown.
Shame on those who wish to get to
the top in a balloon. Only the
man or woman who goes down
bravely will get up boldly."
In the Mariposa Grove he had
been first impressed, not by the
largeness of some of the trees, but by
the fact that around those giants
of the forest smaller trees were
growing and looking contentedly
upward to the larger ones. No
jealousy was there. Let those who
belittle greatness look on the Mari
posa Grove and learn of the weak
ness of jealousy and carping.
Greatness does not grow from be
grudging others. God calls those
who, like Saul, have played a
humble part well, to be kings
among men. Yosemite and Mari
posa should come as an incarna
tion of the Divine Spirit to Ameri
cans, and teach them of the beauty
of an ungrudging spirit.
