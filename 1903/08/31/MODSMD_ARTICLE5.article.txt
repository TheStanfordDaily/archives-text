# THE 						RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS.
## Method by Which Candidates Will be Selected and Examined. 
### 
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler
of the University of California has
been made chairman of a commit
tee that will have charge of select
ing the Rhodes scholarship candi
dates who will go to Oxford from
the state of California. The state
has been divided into three groups
in order that the appointment may
be made with fairness to all the
colleges in the state. California
and Stanford will form two of the
groups while the third will be
composed of all the smaller colleges
in the state. The third group will
be allowed to furnish its quota
every seventh year.
It will be more than a year be
fore the first American Rhodes
scholar takes up his residence at
Oxford, as the first election will
not take place until next spring.
A qualifying examination will be
held in each state between Febru
ary and May of 1904. The pur
pose of this examination will not
be competitive, but merely to sat
isfy the trustees that the applicant
is fully qualified to enter upon a
course of study at Oxford. The
Rhodes scholars will be selected
from the successful men in these
examinations and in accordance
with the apportionment that lias
been made to each state and terri
tory. The requirements of the
candidate's examination at Oxford
includes the whole of arithmetic,
either algebra or geometry, Greek
and Latin grammar, translation
from English into Latin prose, and
Greek and Latin authors.
The committees and universities
that will have these appointments
in charge will be furnished with a
statement of the qualifications
which Cecil Rhodes desired in the
holders of his scholarships.
They will also be asked to furnish
as full statement as possible of the
school and college career of each
elected scholar, with the special
grounds of his appointment. One
of the requirements that has been
decided on by the Rhodes trustees
is that the men selected shall have
at least reached the end of their
second year at some recognized
degree granting university or col
lege of the United States. Schol
ars must be unmarried citizens of
the United States, and must be
between nineteen and twenty-four
years of age. Where several candi
dates present themselves from a
single college or university, the
committees of selection will request
the faculty to decide upon their
claims and offer the name of the
candidate chosen by that college
as its representative in the final
election. Candidates may choose
whether they will apply for the
scholarship in the state in which
they have acquired the above
mentioned educational qualifica
tions or in their native state. They
must, however, be prepared to pre
sent themselves for examination
in the state they select. Candi
dates should, during the month of
January, 1904, notify the chairman
of the committee of selection in the
state or territory for which they

apply, or the head of the university
appointing to the scholarship, of
their intention to present them
selves for examination. The decis
ion of the committee of selection
or the university making the ap
pointment shall he final as regards
eligibility.
One of the most interesting feat
ures of the competition is the great
amount of classical study that
will he necessary to pass the Oxford
examinations. The fact that a
thorough familiarity of the Greek
authors is among the requisites
will disqualify hundreds of Amer
ican students. The following is
the comprehensive list of classical
authors, a reading knowledge of
whom is required by Oxford :
Demosthenen, (1) Philippics 1-2
and Olynthiacs 1-3, or (2) De
Corona; Euripides, any two of the
following plays : Hecuba, Medes,
Alcestis, Bachae; Homer, Iliad 1-
5 or 2-6, or (2) Odyssey 1-5, 2-6;
Plato, Apology and Crito ; Sopho
cles, Antigone and Ajax ; Xeno
phon, Anabasis 1-4 or 2-5; Caesar,
I)e Hello Gallico 1-4; Cicero (1)
the first two Philippic orations, or
(2) the four Cataline orations, and
In Verrem, act 1, or (3) the ora
tions Pro Murena and Lege Ma
nilla, or (4) the treatises De Senec
ute or De Amicitia; Horace (1)
odes 1-4, or (2) satires, or (3) epis
tles; Livy, books 21 and 22; Virgil,
(1) the Bucolics with books 1-3 of
the iEneid, or (2) the Georgics, or
the TEneid, books 1-5 or 2-6.
