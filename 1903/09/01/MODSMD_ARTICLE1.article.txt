# FIRST FOOTBALL RALLY
## Fifty-six Men Signed for Varsity and Freshman Teams at Meeting Last Night. 
### 
The football season opened au
spiciously last night with the first
big rally of the year in the Encina
clubroom. Fifty-six men signed
the training rules. Of these,
twenty-two put their names down
for the Varsity team, and the re
maining thirty-four are candidates
for the Freshman eleven. This
large total, however, does not rep
resent the full strength of the squad
that will appear on the field, for
some of the old Varsity men and
many promising candidates were
not present at the meeting last
night, but will sign within the next
few days.
Every speaker last night empha
sized the fact that the training
rules this year are to be strictly
observed, and that any infractions
will be visited with immediate dis
missal from the squad. Coaches,
captain, and trainer laid stress on
the great importance of the men
being in the fittest possible condi
tion for the games, and said that
every effort would be made to im
prove them.
Professor Lewers of the Law
department, a player of some
years ago, who again this
year will assist in the coaching,
made a special appeal to every
able-bodied freshman to get out
and play, Those who have played
will be put right into the game,
and those who have not will be
taught and given every opportunity
to show what is in them. Only out
of large numbers can a winning
team be drawn. Professor Lewers
paid a warm tribute to the Belmont
team of last year, which, although
lighter than most of its opponents,
was yet their superior in almost
every other way. "The making of
that team," said Lewers, "was the
work of Lanagan. This year every
Stanford man should stand behind
him. I believe Lanagan is the
man of the hour, and I call on
every Stanford man to support
him loyally and vigorously, for
that is the only way we can win."
Trainer Moulton made a short
address, impressing upon the can
didates the vital importance of
training, and appealing to the stu
dent body to support them loyally.
The moat important address of
the evening was that of Coach Lan
agan, who was given a warm recep
tion by the men. He said in part:
"Every man must realize that we
have an uphill tight to make this
year. Berkeley has practically all
of last year's Varsity team, and we
have much to do in the few weeks
that lie ahead of us. Teams which
are perhaps our equals Berkeley
has beaten, and they have the con
fidence of victory. This year an
all-trained team will go into the
game, even if they are all freshmen
or average only 140 pounds. The
absolute necessity of a properly
trained team has been demonstrated
again and again, and this year
every man will be in the best con
dition that it is possible to get him.
"I want to make it plain that
there is a show for every man who
gets out. We are looking for the

best man for every position. It
does not matter whether he has
played football before or not.
Every man will have a chance in
the preliminary games to show
what he can do. If a good lot of
material comes out we can have a
good team, and if we are beaten it
will be only because Berkeley has
a better one."
Captain Bansbach said the best
coaches and trainers had been se
cured, and it was the part of the
men to do the rest. He said there
would be enough preliminary
games to give every man a chance.
Anyone who violated training rules
would be immediately dismissed.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, head of
the gymnasium, said a few words
about what training had done for
Eastern colleges.
Then all the candidates among
the five hundredmen present

The football season opened au
spiciously last night with the first
big rally of the year in the Encina
clubroom. Fifty-six men signed
the training rules. Of these,
twenty-two put their names down
for the Varsity team, and the re
maining thirty-four are candidates
for the Freshman eleven. This
large total, however, does not rep
resent the full strength of the squad
that will appear on the field, for
some of the old Varsity men and
many promising candidates were
not present at the meeting last
night, but will sign within the next
few days.
Every speaker last night empha
sized the fact that the training
rules this year are to be strictly
observed, and that any infractions
will be visited with immediate dis
missal from the squad. Coaches,
captain, and trainer laid stress on
the great importance of the men
being in the fittest possible condi
tion for the games, and said that
every effort would be made to im
prove them.
Professor Lewers of the Law
department, a player of some
years ago, who again this
year will assist in the coaching,
made a special appeal to every
able-bodied freshman to get out
and play, Those who have played
will be put right into the game,
and those who have not will be
taught and given every opportunity
to show what is in them. Only out
of large numbers can a winning
team be drawn. Professor Lewers
paid a warm tribute to the Belmont
team of last year, which, although
lighter than most of its opponents,
was yet their superior in almost
every other way. "The making of
that team," said Lewers, "was the
work of Lanagan. This year every
Stanford man should stand behind
him. I believe Lanagan is the
man of the hour, and I call on
every Stanford man to support
him loyally and vigorously, for
that is the only way we can win."
Trainer Moulton made a short
address, impressing upon the can
didates the vital importance of
training, and appealing to the stu
dent body to support them loyally.
The moat important address of
the evening was that of Coach Lan
agan, who was given a warm recep
tion by the men. He said in part:
"Every man must realize that we
have an uphill tight to make this
year. Berkeley has practically all
of last year's Varsity team, and we
have much to do in the few weeks
that lie ahead of us. Teams which
are perhaps our equals Berkeley
has beaten, and they have the con
fidence of victory. This year an
all-trained team will go into the
game, even if they are all freshmen
or average only 140 pounds. The
absolute necessity of a properly
trained team has been demonstrated
again and again, and this year
every man will be in the best con
dition that it is possible to get him.
"I want to make it plain that
there is a show for every man who
gets out. We are looking for the

best man for every position. It
does not matter whether he has
played football before or not.
Every man will have a chance in
the preliminary games to show
what he can do. If a good lot of
material comes out we can have a
good team, and if we are beaten it
will be only because Berkeley has
a better one."
Captain Bansbach said the best
coaches and trainers had been se
cured, and it was the part of the
men to do the rest. He said there
would be enough preliminary
games to give every man a chance.
Anyone who violated training rules
would be immediately dismissed.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, head of
the gymnasium, said a few words
about what training had done for
Eastern colleges.
Then all the candidates among
the five hundredmen present
signed the rules. Those sign
ing for the Varsity are as
follows: Louis P. Bansbach, '04,
captain; P. A. Tarpey, '05, D. Tar
