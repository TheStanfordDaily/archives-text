The football rally last night
showed several things: It showed
that every student has confidence
in the ability of this year's eleven
to capture the intercollegiate con
test, and that the undergraduate
body as a unit is going to support
the men every minute from now
until the outcome of the November
game whether victory or defeat
seems to be the outcome. Among
other things that stand out clearly
from last night's demonstration is
the positive assurance that there
will be no infractions of training
ruleß by anyone on the squad.
With the enthusiastic approval from
every student of the determined po
sition of coach, captain and trainer,
there stands out ineffaceably the
assurance that the Stanford team of
1903 will enter the big game in as
perfect condition as any eleven has
been brought. No one will tempt
the football men to slight breaking
of rules. Every member of the
University is going to assist in the
faithful and absolute observance
of training. If the game is lost, it
will not be because the coaches and
trainers have been negligent in the
care of the men. Defeat will not
come because slight non-observ
ance of rules has been overlooked.
Nor will defeat be the outcome
because the eleven enters the strug
gle without the manifold support
of every Stanford man and woman.
If victory goes againßt the Cardi
nal, the better team will have car
ried off the laurels. No post-mor
tems will be necessary to find some
avenue where the Stanford team
might have won. After all, victory
is not the main thing in college
athletics. To bear the honors of
the day is the hope and prayer of
every supporter of any college
team, but the one great difference
between professional and amateur
struggles is that the college man
enters athletics for the sake of
athletics and for the glory of his
university. The attitude of the
true college man towards his insti

tution is the game in defeat as in
victory. Victory is very great, but
it is not the essential thing. The
result of athletics is to bind the
students together, to create a spirit
of love and fealty towards the
university, and to make the uni
versity man and woman more
loyal supporters because there is
some outlet for the love that is
held for one's college. College
spirit is born out of this devotion
and receives its strength through
the frequent participation of the
student organizations in contests
in which the glory of the university
is concerned. So whether success
or defeat is a surety as the season
goes along, every Stanford man
can feel that the team will be en
thusiastically supported.
