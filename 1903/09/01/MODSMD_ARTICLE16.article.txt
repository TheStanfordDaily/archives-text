# "Chaparral" Out This Week
## 
### 
The first number of the Chaparral
is now on the press and will be
ready for distribution within a few
days. The paper starts in the year
with an entirely new typographical
appearance. In the past the paper's
literary contributions have been
fully up to the standard of the best
Eastern college humorous papers,
but a lack of financial support has
kept the Chaparral from attempting
elaborate typographical effects. The
paper is now able to attempt ex
tensive typographical innovations.
It will be printed on Scottish laid
paper imported especially for the
Chaparral, and the Post Old Style
headings used last year will give
way to the Cheltingham Old Style
type, the latest innovation in de
corative type. The Stanley-Taylor
Company of San Francisco will do
the printing.
The drawings in the first number
are bv Bonnell, '03, Sheehy,'o6, and
Miss Clara Lathrop, '06, and deal
mostly with the wail of freshmen
and others on registration days.
The leading prose feature is a new
version of the play of Hamlet, done
by a prominent English major.
