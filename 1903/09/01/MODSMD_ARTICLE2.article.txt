At the football rally in Encina
last night Treasurer Cowden took
occasion to make some interesting
remarks about the student body

finances. He said the students
had a deficit to face, and appealed
to them to be prompt in the pay
ment of their dues. Referring to
the general subscription for the
new tennis court, he said that a
large number of students had
failed to pay the sum for which
they had put down their names.
The subscription list shows that
there is still $280 due on this ac
count, and a systematic canvass will
be made to collect it. This sum
would enable the treasurer to clear
the debt on the new court, and to
putin repair the old courts in front
of Encina gymnasium.
