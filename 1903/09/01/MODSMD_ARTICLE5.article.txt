# Improvements on the Quad.
## 
### 
The work of leveling the ground
between the buildings of the outer
and inner quad is rapidly approach
ing completion. The space will
later be covered with gravel. The
terrace in front of the outer quad
will be planted in grass. In addi
tion to the row of small urns on
the front facade, large pedestal urns,
five feet in height, will be placed in
front of the Science buildings, the
Arch and Library. The design of
these urns is the work of Architect
Hodges.
The buildings on the inner quad
which formerly housed the Chem
ical and Physical laboratories are
being remodelled. Partitions have
been erected with the ultimate in
tention of making additional class
rooms.
