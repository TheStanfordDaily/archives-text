# GRIDIRON WORK BEGINS.
## Large Number of Candidates Appear on Field to Start Football Season. 
### 
The actual work of the football
season began with the fiiht practice
yesterday afternoon. Hi xty men
were on the field from 4:45 until
6 o'clock. But six Varsity men
turned out. They were Dole, '05,
Thompson, '04, Hauverman, '04.
P. Tarpey, '05, (Murk, '04, and Cap
tain Bansbach, '04. Ten of hist
year's Freshman team, substitutes,
and Second Team players were on
the ground. They were Butterfield,
'04, Shields, '03, Wilbur, '05, Pres
ton, '06, Stanford, '04, D. Tarpey,
'05, Stillman, "05, Jacobs, '04,
Chandler, '04, and Scholfielci, '06.
The remaining forty-five players
came from the Freshman class.
The only work done was practice
in kicking and catching the ball.
The men were divided into two
squads on the twenty-yard lines,
and were kept at kicking the sev
eral balls for over an hour. Coach
Lanagan spent some time with
Center Hauverman and the backs,
giving instruction in snapping the
hall.
Until more of the Varsity men
turn out little can be conjectured
as to the probable strength of the
big eleven. Among the fairly large
number of Freshmen there can be
easily seen material for a strong
first-year team.
No line-up will be attempted for
several days, as the weather is too
hot and the players are too soft for
heavy work.
About two hundred students
turned out for the first practice and
they responded in good form to the
yell-leading of Kuhn and Baker.
At California yesterdny one hun
dred candidates appeared on the
field. Of these over fifty were fresh
men and the rest old varsity play
ers and other upperclassmen.
Light practice for the varsity will be
carried on for several days.
The California freshman squad,
however, will probably be divided
into teams within a day or two.
