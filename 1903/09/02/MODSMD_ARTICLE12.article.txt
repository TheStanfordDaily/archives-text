The report of the bondsmen of
the inn Club printed in this issue
will undoubtedly raise some com
ment as to just what is going to be
done with the students' eating club.
The fact that there is a deficit for
the first week of the year is not the
main thing to consider in the pres
ent financial difficulty of the club.
The first week of the year showed
the expenses larger than the re
ceipts because the patronage is not
large enough to cover expenses, and
the extra items of starting in were
enough to considerably swell the
expense list. There seems to be an
extraordinary lack of interest in
the present trouble on the part of
those very students who should be
most solicitous about the mainten
ance of the campus boarding club.
Last night's meeting had so few
attendants that no action could be
taken in regard to paying off the
$'2500 deficit that faces the mem
bers. Another meeting will be held
this week, when it behooves every
member to be present to decide on
some plan of removing the debt.
It is absolutely certain that the
debt lias to be paid. The only
thing to consider is the way of pay
ing it. The belief seems to be cur
rent that the bondsmen are liable
for the deficiency. In fact, these
men will suffer no loss beyond the
sum they have already paid to the
University for breakage of dishes
and other destruction of property.
The five members of the faculty are
bondsmen merely as to the lease of
the building. They are running
the club on their own responsibility
and merely as a favor to the mem
bers of the University who have no
eating-place, as the business office
of the Univor ;«v would not again
leaae the buildio_> to the Inn Club
until the del>i »ms paid or some
thing done t 1 • w ml removing it. If
the expense* continue to exceed the
receipts at the < lose of the week it
is the intention of the bondsmen to
close up the Inn. They cannot
he censured for this, since it
means nothing to them to

continue operating at their
own pecuniary loss. Obviously the
abandonment of the Inn would be a
grave calamity to the students,and
such a result must not be allowed.
It is perfectly plain that an assess
ment will have to be levied upon
all those students having member
ship tickets. How large this will
he is to be decided at the coming
meeting. It will mean nothing to
the members to have the club close,
for they will not thus escape re
sponsibility for these individual
shares. If an assessment is now
levied and the Inn remains open,
probably half of the indebtedness
could be removed by judicious
management in the near future.
Otherwise, each member would
have to pay twice as much, as the
entire debt in this case would have
to be raised by levying an assess
ment. In the one case theassessment
would amount to about ten dollars
and in the other in the neighbor
hood of twenty dollars. In no case
could any one now in the University
avoid paying, as the University
authorities could force the payment.
In the meantime it is the duty of
all the students who ordinarily eat
there to continue at the Inn. The
new students, although not con
cerned in the deficit of last year,
are vitally interested in keeping
the Inn open, and all that are able
should lend their patronage. Un
der no circumstances should the
students allow the club to close.
