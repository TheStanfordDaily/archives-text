# ADDITIONS TO MUSEUM.
## Valuable Exhibit of Venetian Glassware the Gift of Sign or Camerino. 
### 
The modest private collections
which have from time to time been
donated to the Stanford Museum
received an important addition this
summer. Signor Camerino, of the
firm of Salviati, Camerino & Co.,
whose glass works are located at
Venice, is the donor of a ver}' val
uable collection of rare Venetian
glassware which is now under the
care of Curator I'eterson. Signor
Camerino was prompted to his act
by a recent visit he made to the
University when he offered to fur
nish an exhibit for the Museum.
The result of his promise was a
consignment including two hun
dred pieces and valued at well over
two thousand dollars.
The extensive variety of the Ve
netian glass includes patterns vary
ing in shape and quality from the
products of the fourteenth century
to the best work of the modern
era. Each specimen represnts a
different pattern. The central case
of the exhibit is devoted to a collec
tion of vases. The delicate ware is
shaped in countless different ways,
long, slender flagons standing side
by side with the squat figures of a
different period. In another case
there are wine glasses, claret jugs,
mere feathers in weight, while in
a third there are heavy, crusted
varieties whose prismatic reflections
and iridescent effects make them
beautiful specimens.
A special rotunda in one of the
new wings has been given to the
collection which Signor Camerino's
prominence in the art of glass
manufacturing makes it due.
