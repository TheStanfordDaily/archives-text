# TAKE NO ACTION ON DEFICIT.
## Members of Inn Club Meet and Receive Report of Finances. 
### 
At a meeting of the Inn Club
held last evening Prof. R.L. Green,
of the Department of Mathematics*,
presented a report of the financial
operations of the Inn for the week
ending August 30th. Professor
Green represented the bondsmen of
the Inn Club, who are the follow
ing faculty members: Dr. J. C.
Branner, Dr. 0. L. Elliott, and
Professors R. E. Allardice, J. O.
Griffin, and 11. L. Green, who are
conducting the Inn solely in the
interests of the students. Very few
members of the Inn Club were
present, and it was decided to have
another meeting of the organiza
tion some evening of this week,
when more students can be present.
No action was taken in regard to
the $2500 debt of the club, but
those present discussed ways and
means of liquidating the debt, and
it seemed to be the consensus of
opinion that an assessment on each
member of the organization was
the only satisfactory method of
wiping ont the indebtedness. Of
the Board of Directors of the Inn
there were present at last night's
meeting J. G. Dehy, '03, and J. A.
Merrill, '04. A. S. Kalenborn, '03,
G. A. Scoville, '03, and C. K. Stud
-Iy, '03, are the other members. The
two former are not now in college.

the Inn, August 25th to August
