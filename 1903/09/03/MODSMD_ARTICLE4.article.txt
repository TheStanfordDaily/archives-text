# OLYMPIAN GAMES TRY-OUT
## Indoor Meet in October at Mechanics' Pavilion.â€”Stanford Athletes to Compete. 
### 
Last night in San Francisco a
meeting of the Olympian Games
Committee of the Pacific Athletic
Association was held. J. C. Mc-
Caughern, '04, last year's track
captain, was the representative of
Stanford athletic interests.
Although rumors of a fall meet
on the Coast have reached Stanford
before, nothing definite enough to
tempt the men to start training
has been known up to this time.
In all probability, with the an
nouncement of tlie meet many of
last year's Varsity men will at
once begin light fall training.
There is an abundance of winning
material from last year's Varsity
track team on the campus. By
next week men will probably start
training for the sprints and field
events.
Besides a general outline for the
work of preparation that must pre
cede thedeparture of a team from the
Coast to the Olympian games in
1904 at the St. Louis Exposition,
definite steps were taken in regard
to a preliminary track meet. It
was decided by the committee to
hold an indoor track meet at Me
chanics' Pavilion in San Francisco
on the night of October 16th.
Primarily the object of the meet is
to arouse the interest of Coast ath
letes in the coming international
games, but more than that the com
mittee wish to get an idea of the
relative standing of the men who
will compete for places in the team.
Entry in the meet, is practically un
restricted. The only qualifications
are that a competitor must be a
registered amateur. There will be
eleven events for candidates for the
Olympian team and a one-half mile
run open to boys from the prepar
atory schools of the Pacific Coast.
The events comprise the regular
schedule of ind( or meets. The first
contest will be a forty yard straight
away, the indoor race which is com
parable to the hundred-yard dash
in the open. The other races will
be for 150 yards, 300 yards, 600
yards, 1,000 yards and 2 miles.
The field events will be the stand
ing broad jump, without weights,
the running high jump, the pole
vault, putting the 16-pound shot,
and si 120-yard hurdle race over six
low hurdles. For each race there
will be a first, second, and third
prize.
The Mechanics' Pavilion has not
been used for an indoor meet since
1893 and consequently is without a
track. The work of preparing a
track lias been placed in the hands
of Jack Gleason of the Olympic
Club and D. E. Brown, Stanford
'97. They will survey the interior
of the Pavilion for a track next
week; from the rough preliminary
forecast it is expected that they will
lay off an eight-lap to the mile
track.
