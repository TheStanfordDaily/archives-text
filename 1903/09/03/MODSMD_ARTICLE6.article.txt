# NO FALL PRACTICE.
## Baseball Men Will Do No Work Until the Spring Semester. 
### 
The baseball squad this year will
do none of the fall practice work
that the 1903 squad undertook.
There is a general feeling that fall
baseball work, owing to the desul
tory manner in which it has al
ways been carried on, is on the
whole useless. In the past when
the men have turned out for fall
practice they have profited little
by their work. This season Cap
tain Ball has determined to wait
until after Christmas and then
have a long uninterrupted season
of work. Another motive which
leads to the elimination of baseball
practice this semester is the fact
that the funds of the student body
are in such a depleted condition
that the expensive and entirely
unremunerative fall work can
hardly be carried.
Although it is too early in the
year to get an idea of the available
baseball material, there is such a
great lack of old Varsity mfen that
their absence is very noticeable.
Captain Hall will be on hand, to
gether with Roosevelt, '04, Craw
ford, '04, Tritch, '04, Parker, '03,
Trowbridge, '05, Blake, '04, and
Dudley, '06, Wirt, '06, and Sales,
'06, of last year's squad. All
of these men played in prac
tice games last season and all are
possibilities for next year's nine.
In addition to this list there are a
number of last year's freshmen and
a number of men who entered this
year with first-class preparatory
school reputations. In spite of the
fact that the squad will be large in
numbers, there are but few star
players who will return to college.
A season of consistent practice is
expected to do much to round the
men into shape, but a preliminary
forecast offers but little encourage
ment to Stanford supporters.
