# RARE GIFT TO UNIVERSITY.
## Dr. Jordan Makes Present of Private Collection of Books on Fishes. 
### 
Dr. Jordan has presented to the
UDiversity his magnificent collec
tion of books on fishes. The col
lection consists of about 3000 vol
umes, and is the working library
that the President has gathered
together during the past three dec
ades. It has always been available
to the Zoology department of the
University, but it has now been
turned over completely as Univer
sity property. It will be shelved
in the new quarters of the Zoology
department in the northwest cor
ner of the outer quad.
Thts gift is one of the most im
portant that has been made to the
scientific collection of the Univer
sity. Many of the volumes are of
great value and could not be dupli
cated. There are books by learned
ichthyologists of past centuries,
and volumes that bring the history
of ichthyology down to the present
day. Among the most important
works is a complete net of Marc
Elieser Bloch's "Ichthyology, or
the Natural History of Fishes,"
which, besides the matter in
French, contains thousands of
beautifully hand-painted pictures
of fish. There is a set of Bleeker's
Atlas of the Fishes of the Indian
Ocean, which contains hundreds of
illustrations, also hand-painted.
There are complete sets of Cuvier's
Natural History of Fish, a French
work, and of the Zoological Record.
In addition to these important
books, there are 237 volumes of
pamphlets, containing the count
less treatises on every phase of the
subject that have been published
during past years. These pam
phlets number many thousands,
but each one has been carefully
catalogued and can be located at
once.
