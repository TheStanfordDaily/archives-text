During past years Stanford has
always had a prize football song,
and this year will be no exception
to the rule. In the near future the
Executive Committee will offer a
prize, and in all probability a
number of songs will be submitted
in the contest. What Stanford
needs, however, is not a song that
has been dashed off on the spur of
the moment in hope of capturing a
money prize. Such songs serve
their temporary purpose and die a
natural death. There is need of a
song inspired by real feeling, set to
a snappy tune that will keep it
alive until, in its field, it becomes
as much of a classic as "Hail,
Stanford, Hail." There are many
in college who are capable of writ
ing a song that will take its place
along with other college airs
that have become famous for their
inspiring qualities. There is no
need for waiting until the formal
announcement of the offer of a
prize. Those who intend to com
pete should begin at once.
