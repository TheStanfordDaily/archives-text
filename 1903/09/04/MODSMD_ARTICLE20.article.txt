# NEARLY COMPLETED.
## Engineering Departments Will Soon Take Possession of Splendid Apartments. 
### 
The new building on the south
east corner of the outer quad, in
tended for the recitation and draft
ing rooms of the Departments of
Mechanical, Electrical and Civil
Engineering, is now nearly com
pleted, but it is not probable that
it will be occupied before Novem
ber, as the equipment, such as
blackboards, desks and chairs, has
not yet been provided.
The new building is so arranged
that the work of the first two years
is taken care of on the ground
Hoor. The strictly professional
work will be provided for on the
second Hoor. There the drafting
rooms are grouped around the
seminary rooms, so that students
have ready access to the books and
periodicals. The basement of the
building will be used for a geo
detic laboratory. The other labora
tory work will be carried on in the
building at present occupied by
the Department of Civil Engineer
ing. Here the hydraulic labora
tory will be located.
Next year the present machine
shop building will be extended east
one hundred and ten feet, filling up
the space between that shop and
the power-house. The completed
structure is to be the same length
as the old Civil Engineering build
ing. Plans have already been
tlrawn, but building work will not
begin for over a year.
One-half of the new addition is
to be turned over to the new de
partment which is to be established
for the manufacture and repair of
apparatus for all the departments
â€¢of the University. The other por
tion will be used as the testing
laboratory of the Civil Engineering
department.
