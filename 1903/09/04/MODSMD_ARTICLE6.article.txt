# TRACK FORECAST.
## Outlook for an Even Chance Against California Next Spring. 
### 
While nothing will he done for
some time in the line of track work,
Trainer Moulton has been busy
ever since the opening of the Uni
versity looking over the available
material in the entering jlass.
Of lust year's team Stanford
loses three men: Captain Mc-
Caughern and L. C. Hawley, '03,
in the sprints, and E. A. Smith, '03,
in the quarter-mile. Although the
loss is a heavy one, Stanford is for
tunate in that Turpin, '06, who
was not able to compete last year,
will in a measure fill the vacancy
in the dashes, and that Dunn, '04,
Grossman, '04, and perhaps Dole,
'05, will probably take three places
in the quarter. Besides the men
who won points, a number of other
prospective place-winners will be
lost. But in the field events and
in the distance runs Stanford can
expect to hold her own. It is in
the jumps that she is weak. Wel
ler, '06, is a good man who can be
counted on as a point-winner, and
he, together with Ball, '06, and
Abbott, '06, form a nucleus around
which Stanford must build a num
ber of first-class jumpers.
Trainer Moulton in a recent in
terview summed up the situation
well when he said the chances of
building a winning team were
about even. He said that the
secret of success lies in getting
every man to turn out for training
who has even a slight basis upon
which to build. It is a pet theory
of Moulton's that an ordinary man
by hard work and unflinching de
termination can develop into a
point-winner if he will only keep
at it. His theory was well
supported by last year's team,
for among the men who won points
in 1903 many, as freshman, had
been completely underrated. Moul
ton is confident that if the under
graduates show the same spirit
during the coining year that they
evinced during last season that
Stanford may hope for a victory,
in all probability independent
fall training will start among
some of last year's Varsity men
at once. Several are contemplat
ing working out for the Olym
pian games try-out to be held in
October.
Track Captain Holman has not
returned to college, and possibly
may not do so until next semester.
Should that be the case, fall train
ing will be carried on under the
leadership of some of last season's
winners with the aid of Trainer
Moulton in the time that he can
take away from the football men.
Last year's captain, McCaughern,
feels sure that the secret of the
success of his team lay in the pre
liminary season of fall training;
and there is a recognized tendency
in Stanford athletics to encourage
fall training among track athletes.
