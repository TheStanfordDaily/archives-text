# DEBATING INTERESTS.
## Stanford Will Have an Unusual Squad from Which to Choose This Year's Debaters. 
### 
With the opening of the literary
meetings of the various debating
societies next week, comes the
question of how Stanford will be
represented on the intercollegiate
platform this year. For the first
time the University will have a
thoroughly experienced debating
squad. Ritter, '04, Roehr, '04, and
Lewis, '04, of last year's Carnot
team, are back and will enter the
trv-outs again. Likewise Spencer,
'04, who with Lewis and Roehr
constituted the victorious intercol
legiate trio last April, expects to
try for a place on both the impor
tant teams. The alternates of last
year, as well as nearly all the men
who made places in the finals, have
returned to college and will enter
the competition again. These men,
together with the usual small num
ber of Freshmen and other new
students, will constitute a debating
squad from which the judges can
easily choose several strong
teams.
Nothing has as yet been done
toward extension of the agreement
with the University of Washington.
The original agreement called for
two debates â€”one at Stanford and
one at Washington. The first of
these resulted in a tie, and the sec
ond in a victory for Washington.
For Stanford to renew the agree
ment with Washington will not be
difficult, and it is possible that
some such arrangement will be
made.
