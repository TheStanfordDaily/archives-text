## 
### 
There is a movement on foot
among the alumni of the Univer
sity of California to make arrange
ments whereby the graduates of
Stanford and California may secure
better seats at the annual intercol
legiate game. Owing to the growth
in size and importance of the
alumni there is a feeling that they
should .receive courtesies similar to
those extended to the University
Club of San Francisco. There will
be an attempt made to reserve a
block of good seats for the use of
the alumni. A committee of Cali
fornia graduates has taken the
matter in hand. The members are
Alfred C. Skaife, '00, Frank Otis,
'73, Wiggington Creed, '98, John
Eshleman, '02, Jesse Steinhart, '01.
