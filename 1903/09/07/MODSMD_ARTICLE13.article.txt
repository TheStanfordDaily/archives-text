# FIRST WEEK OF FOOTBALL.
## Preliminary Work is Directed Toward Developing Sprinters for Freshman and Varsity Elevens. 
### 
The football practice which end
ed last (Saturday night was of too
light a character to allow much de
duction as to the material for either
a Freshman or Varsity team. But
from the appearance of the men
who have signed for training and
have been punting the hall during
the last week the probability of a
good Freshman team is strong.
In (J. E. Dole, Stott and Frank
lin, the coaches have found a trio
from which a good punier can be
developed. Special attention has
been devoted to instructing these
men in the finer points of the punt
and field-goal, as each of them,
while an excellent natural kicker,
lacks experience.
Among the Freshman candidates
there is some good material. In the
light work of starting and. running
in punts, several have shown up
well. Before this week is over the
Freshman squad will be divided
into teams, with the possibility of
a short line-up.
The question of greatest import
ance which confronts the coaches is
the filling of the vacancies in the
Varsity eleven, it is not sure that
McGilvray will register in college,
and unless he does return the posi
tion of full-back as well as three
places on the line must be filled by
players without actual Varsity ex
perience. There are good players
on last year's second eleven, varsity
substitutes and one or two fresh
men, so that the fight for a place
on the first eleven promises to be
broad and long. But the dearth of
strong material is discovered at
once when a set of strong substi
tutes is looked for. The light prac
tice of the past week has loosened
the men up so that they are in
shape tostand hard work. Through
out this week practice will be
heavier until the next Monday,
when in all probability the Varsity
players will line up for the first
time. In the meantime the coaches
will devote their attention to work
in punting, goal kicking and run
ning in of punts.
