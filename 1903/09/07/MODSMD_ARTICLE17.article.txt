The 1905 class annual is to con
tinue the improvement begun in
last year's book, and will endeavor
to make the publication more of a
year-book than before. Every year
that end is being more nearly
reached, and as the Quad ought
essentially to be a record of the
year's best work in every line, the
decision of the Junior editor to
throw open the prizes to the best
stories, poems, and art work that
appear under the name of a Stan
ford student in any publication
whatever will do much to attain
the desired aim. Since the book is
a record of the year, it is not right
that the award of the prizes be re
stricted to work done especially for
the competition. Besides insuring
to the annual literary features of
a high order of ability, the change
will in a measure serve to raise the
standard of the other University
publications, since those who write
will do so with the knowledge that
their contributions may find per
manent form.
