# TRUSTEES CONSIDER FEES.
## Special Committee Meets Students Who Petitioned for Return of Registration Dues. 
### 
The special committee appointed
by the Board of Trustees to inquire
into the petitions of the students
who believed that the}' should not
be required to pay a registration
fee as students from outside the
State was in session for several
hours Saturday morning. The
meeting was presided over by
George E. Crothers, secretary of the
Board of Trustees; the others
present were Dr. J. C. Branner,
Professor Abbott of the Law de
partment, and Charles G. Lathrop,
treasurer of the University. The
fees that had been collected before
registration were remitted in a
number of cases without question,
and then the committee spent sev
eral hours in hearing the pleas of
the others who maintained that
they are bona fide residents of Cal
ifornia and not here merely while
securing an education. After all
the testimony had been given the
whole matter was left in the hands
of Judge S. F. Leib of San Jose,
former president of the Board of
Trustees, who will make a report
within a short time.
