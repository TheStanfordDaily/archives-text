# THE 						SUNDAY SERMON.
## Chaplain Gardner Advocates a Stanford University Settlement in San Francisco. 
### 
The sermon on Sunday morning
was preached by the Rev. I).
Charles Gardner. He took as his
text Romans 1:16, "1 am not
ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
As a closing theme of his text, Rev.
Gardner suggested a plan that he
had in mind for showing some
practical results of the religious
work at Stanford. lie went on to
say that he would never he satisfied
with the development of the relig
ious life of the University until it
should give a larger expression of
its vitality than it does in its work
among the students.
He said: "The current of young
life and devotiun passing through
this church should supply the
motive power for some practical
Christian work outside our own
borders, and this is the plan to
which we should address our
thoughts while the time is ripe :
The establishment in San Fran
cisco of a Stanford University set
tlement to be managed and sup
ported by the undergraduates and
alumni of the University." The
speaker felt sure there were num
bers of Stanford men in San Fran
cisco waiting to give time and
thought and money to some such
practical work.
Rev. Gardner suggested as the
beginning of such a plan the em
ployment of a Stanford district
nurse to work among the poor in
some quarter of San Francisco.
"Religion," he said, "had been
accused oi being impractical, a
thing that concerned itself chiefly
with doctrines and dogmas." He
undertook to prove that religion
is practical, that religion inspires
men to better ideals of patriotism
and public usefulness. Last Mon
day he stood upon the Presidio
Heights and looked down upon
some of the practical results of
religion. The first thing he noticed
was the Children's Hospital. No
one could deny that there was
evidenced in a very vital way the
practicality of Christ's command
ments concerning children. A few
blocks away stands the Maria Kip
Orphanage. Here, too, the prac
tical bide of religion may be seen.
"Compare the innocent faces of
these sheltered little ones with the
faces of the homeless of our cily
streets. Compare the chances in
life of an orphan eirl taught to be
pure, with chances of the orphan
left to the uncertain care of thought
less fathers or shiftless relatives."
In that same district are two
institutions that suggest the con
trast between religion and munici
pal charity : The home for old
ladies and the poorhouse. In one
is to be seen the tender ministra
tions that old age and declining
years should have. In the other
