# EDITORS OF 1905 "QUAD."
## Associate Members of the Staff Announced.â€” Changes in Prize Story Competition. 
### 
Del mar M. Reynolds, editor of
the '05 Quad, lias announced the
following as associate editors of the
Junior Class annual: W. R. Cole,
Benjamin C. Dey, V. E. Stork, E.
B. Favre, T. M. Coen, Miss Clarissa
Ehy, Miss Alice Richards, and
Miss Jeannette Hayward. The
latter will be the art editor.
Reynolds has decided upon a
radical change in this year's publi
cation in the rules governing the
awarding of prizes for the best
story and poem of the current year.
Heretofore the system has been to
award prizes for stories and poems
written expressly for the Quad
competition. It has been decided
that this system is faulty in that it
is not conducive to the publication
of the best literary work of the
year. For example, the faculty
committee in charge of the compe
tition for the 1904 annual refused
to accept as worthy of publication
any one of the poems submitted.
The old plan was not satisfactory,
since every year there is more or
less verse of a very high rank
written for the Sequoia and Chap
arral which is worthy of any Uni
versity prize offered.
For these reasons it has been de
cided that the 1905 Quad take a
step forward along the same line
pursued by last year's annual,
which reprinted the best drawings
that appeared during the year in
the Chaparral. The intention of
the board of the 1905 Quad will, in
consequence, be to offer prizes for
the best story written during the
year by regularly registered under
graduates of the University. The
subject matter of the story and
poem will have no limitation,
although preference will be shown
those articles dealing with Stan
ford life and ideals.
