# PRACTICE GETS INTERESTING.
## Work on the Gridiron Assumes More Spirited and Satisfactory Form. 
### 
Last night's football practice ex
hibited more action than on any
previous day. The preliminary
work of falling on the hall, run
ning down on punts, and light
tackling occupied the hour. For
instruction in falling on the hall
the entire squad was divided into
three groups, each of which was
taken in charge by one of the three
coaches, Lanngan, Sinker and
Lewers. At this work several of
the Freshmen appeared very well
versed in the line points of the
game. Others of the new men,
however, clearly showed utter lack
of previous coaching in the smaller
details of the game.
The practice took on more vigor
when the ends were tried out at
running down on punts. The
punting of Freshman Dole was in
good form. At present Hutterfield,
'04, Wilbur, '05, and Scholfield,
'08, seem to be of equal strength.
Chandler, '05, Stevens, '05, and
the candidates for end on the
Freshman eleven were tried follow
ing up punts and at tackling. The
players who have signed for places
behind the line were given trials at
catching and running in punts.
Considerable promise for the work
is shown by some of the new can
didates.
