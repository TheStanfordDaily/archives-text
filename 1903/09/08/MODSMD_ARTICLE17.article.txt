Tiie University Assembly ceased
to be an experiment tbe moment
the doors were opened for the first
gathering a year ago. It has been
a success from the beginning, and
had its origin in the progressive
ideas of those who had fears that
the so-called Stanford spirit existed
more in name than in fact. Those
who were most apprehensive were
the first to concede that from the
pioneer days there had been no de
cadence in the loyalty of all Stan
ford men and women for their in
stitution. Perhaps there was a
certain crudeness and weakness in
the latter-day expression of the
old spirit, but as a result of the
first Assembly the love of the early
classes took a more vitalized form
than had ever been conceived of. Ev
ery subsequent meeting contributed
its share to broadening the feeling
among the students, and as a
means of strengthening the general
spirit the Assembly has taken
front rank. Thursday morning
will come the first general gather
ing of the year, and if there are
any among those in the University
who disdain devoting one hour
ever}' two weeks to the cultivation
and enlargement of the Stanford
spirit, the closing of classrooms,
laboratories, and Library will leave
them but one place to go. Every
Freshman must be there. Especial
ly important is it that the entering
class get some tangible idea of what
constitutes college loyalty. In
stead of being around the Univer
sity for two or three months with a
hazy conception of what Stanford
really means, tbe Freshman will be
introduced to and filled with the
essence of loyalty from tbe moment
he sees the faculty and student
body to a man gathered in Assem
bly Hall. Let everyone be present
Thursday morning to aid in mak
ing the Assembly a record-breaker.
