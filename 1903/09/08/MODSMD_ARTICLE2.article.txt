# RETURNS FROM ALASKA.
## Professor Barnett Investigates Magnetic Disturbances for United States Geodetic Survey. 
### 
S. J. Barnett, assistant professor
in the Physics department, returned
yesterday from Juneau, Alaska,
where lie has Ween in charge of a
United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey party during the summer.
Professor Harnett made a complete
survey of Juneau and vicinity. He
also investigated the remarkable
magnetic disturbances near Juneau,
especially on Douglas Island and
the north shore of Gastineau Sound,
where the disturbance is very
great, owing to the presence of a
large amount of magnetic rock.
This magnetic peculiarity is very
annoying to navigators, since in
some (daces in the Northern coun
try the deflections of the needle are
eo great that the use of a compass
is practically impossible.
