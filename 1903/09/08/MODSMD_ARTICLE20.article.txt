Some explanation of the new
rules as to English will perhaps he
of interest to the students con
cerned.
For years there has heen a rule
at Stanford that every student he
fore he graduates must have passed
Entrance I, Composition. This re
quirement was intended as a safe
guard against illiteracy in Stan
ford graduates; and many professors
found that those of their students
who had satisfied the requirement
were much better ahle to do credit
able University work than those
who had not. But there were draw
hacks to the system. On the stud
ents' side it was found possible to
go through the entire college course
handicapped by illiteracy, and it
sometimes happened that astudent's
degree had to bo withheld until he
would pass this elementary exam
ination. On the side of the depart
ment it became irksome to look
over paper after paper written by
the same student from time to time,
when it was clear that no serious at
tention had been given to the sub
ject between examinations, and that
there was consequently no reason
able expectation of finding improve
ment.
The new requirement aims to cor
rect the faults of the former system
without injustice to the student or
to the department. It is expected
that even if a student is ill prepared,
and fails both at the beginning and
at the end of his first semester, he
will nevertheless reach the required
standard bv the end of the second
semester, and begin his second year
unhampered. This in effect brings
English Composition into conform
ity with the rule regarding other
entrance conditions, namely, that
they must be made up within a
year of entering the University,
lint English A, with its require
ment of time and money, need not
necessarily be taken. There is a
semester's leeway given, in which
one may take such measures as he
thinks best to qualify for the second
examination test. And then there
is the system of recommended tu
tors, a system found very useful,
though not fully understood by all
Stanford students.
The tutors are recommended by
the department to such students as
wish to have personal instruction.
The uniform fees charged are as
small as is consistent with justice;
and if a student is near the passing
standard the expense of the few
private lessons necessary to reach
it is not great. On the other hand
if there are serious errors to be over
come, the student has the advant
age of trained assistance at no more
cost, possibly less, than would be
necessary in taking English A,
and he is likely to get more person
al attention from the tutor. In
either case the sometimes trying
conditions of a set examination
period are avoided, for the tutor

can hand to the department speci
men papers of actual class rank,
and the student is judged by those.
The department does not give the
final decision to the tutor, but ac
cepts the work done in class when
vouched for by the tutor.
Since the new requirements go
into effect this semester, the exam
ination to be given in December is
the last opportunity given for reg
ular undergraduate students, of
whatever class, to pass Entrance I
by regular examination. It is ob
viously desirable that those who
are yet deficient in the subject give
serious attention to the matter this
semester. S. S. Seward, Jr.
