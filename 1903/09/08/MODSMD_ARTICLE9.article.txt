# REPORT OF INN MANAGER.
## Gain of Fifty Dollars Shown for Second Week of Operation 
### 
The Inn shows no further deficit
Â»it the end of the second week.
There is a slight reduction in the
former deficit of $71.01. Some re
duction in (he salary list may effect
a better result for the third week.
The present intention is to main
tain and perhaps improve the pres
ent service.
The Inn will endeavor to give a
better meal than can he had else
where for the same price. Its suc
cess must come from considerate
treatment by the occupants of En
cina Hall and the public. If those
in Encina expect to crowd the Inn's
capacity in inclement weather, give
it a limited patronage from Mon
days to Fridays and leave it to run
at a loss on Saturdays and Sun
days, no management can ever be
successful. The public patronage
was never better. The management
is on a strict business basis.
Mrs. Stanford erected the Inn for
the convenience of the occupants of
Encina, and their altitude will de
termine its existence. It certainly
cannot be supposed that the faculty
committee will sustain the Inn at
any personal loss.
