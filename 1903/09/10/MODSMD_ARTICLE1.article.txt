# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS.
## Annual Address to Freshmen the Theme of First Student Assembly. 
### 
The first University Assembly of
the year was held in Assembly
Hall this morning. Impromptu
singing and yelling was followed
by a short talk by Mr. Putnam, of
the English department, on the
play "Everyman" which will be
produced at Stanford under the
auspices of the English Club.
Dr. Jordan, as the speaker of the
meeting, delivered the address
which has become a traditional
feature of the opening of each col
lege year. After introducing him
self as a disciple of Andrew D.
White in giving an annual talk to
the entering class, he went on to
say : "You know what I am going
to talk about. The upperclase
men have told you, and they are
here to help enforce the lesson.
They will tell you that the Uni
versity is part of life ; that its
methods are those of life ; no stat
utes set up for you to break; but
when you do go wrong you come
in collision with the universe;
that the few rules exist in the
nature of things ; that men who
break them are not wanted here,
but are escorted to the edge of the
campus. This is not because
drunkenness, rowdyism or des
truction of property is forbidden by
the faculty, but because drunkards,
rowdies, vandals and idlers are not
worth educating."
The theme of his speech, how
ever, was not that drinking, haz
ing, acts of vandalism, and cutting
of recitations are frowned upon by
the faculty. Everyone knows that
these things do not tend to make
Stanford men. "Perhaps the moral
creed laid down by the Chaparral
will he sufficient for all this : 'It
is sinful to queen on the quad ; it
is sinful to go to football practice
except as a rooter ; it is sinful to
fail to subscribe to the college
papers and to support college en
terprises ; it is sinful to graft the
benefits of our college life without
contributing something of some
sort to their betterment,.' To this
we may add : it is sinful to bear
the name of Stanford in places
where one does not wish his own
name."
Making this his theme in regard
to the character of the men of
Stanford, Dr. Jordan spoke of the
attitude of the women. He spoke
of the agitation that was recently
sprung up against co-education,
and he traced this in a large meas
ure to the indifference and care
lessness that women show in per
forming the duties of an under
graduate. lie spoke of the poor
spirit shown by those students who
failed to pay the student body
assessment.
Resides the vicious sides of a
college man that injure him, and
beside the careless traits of char
acter that spoil his best features,
Dr. Jordan spoke of the foolish
things that make men perpetual
members of the entering class.
Dr. Jordan read a pertinent ex
tract from a letter which spoke of
the sufferings "perpetual freshtnen
of all classes" inflict on their ath

letes by "foolish advice." "Next!
to the man who offers to treat an 1
athlete during the training season,
the worst enemy of Stanford ath
letics is the man who uses up the
athlete's time and nerves in useless
talk," the author concluded.
Dr. Jordan closed his speech with j
an expression of the real college
spirit that is behind Stanford men
of the best type. He concluded :
"We have in America a kind of
college man who is able to under
stand life as life. To this type the
Stanford man belongs."
