The change in the publication
of the Alumnus from a monthly to
a weekly is a step in the right di
rection. By keeping the constantly
increasing number of graduates in
close touch with the affairs at the
University those in charge of the
publication will do much towards
bringing about the desired and
ultimate condition where the body
of alumni are the mainstay of the
hopes and traditions of the institu
tion. It is only by such frequent
issues that the old students can be
kept in close range of what is trans
piring at the University. Those
who are acquainted with the older
colleges of the East know what an
important part the alumni fill.
Those graduate bodies are the
strongest which are frequently told
of the doings of their college by
means of strong and serviceable
papers devoted to the alumni.
The Stanford graduate body is as
yet small, but its interest and loy
alty have been shown on every
occasion. The Alumnus will aid
and encourage the old students by
providing them means of increasing
this interest, which can be done
best by informing them what their
classmate# are doing in the world
and what is going on among the
undergradua tes.
