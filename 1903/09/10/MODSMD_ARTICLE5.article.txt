# CHEMAWAS TO COME.
## First Game for Freshman Football Team May be Played Saturday. 
### 
Treasurer Cowden has completed i
arrangements with the manage-!
ment of the Chemawa Indian foot
ball team for a game with the
Varsity on October 26th. The
Indians will also play the Cali
fornia varsity on a date near the
26th. The Chemawa team is one
of the strongest elevens in the'
Northwest and will be able to give
Stanford and California a hard
fight. The men come from the
government Indian school at Che
mawa, Oregon.
The first game of the season will
he played Saturday between the
Freshmen and some neighboring 1
team, probably Santa Clara College.
The first game scheduled for the
Varsity is with Reliance Athletic-
Club, September 19th. The line-up]
for both of these games will not be
announced until the dates for
which they are scheduled.
Tuesday and Wednesday's prac
tice more nearly approximated reg
ular scrimmage work than an}* pre
vious practice of the season. Fol
lowing the light work of falling on
the ball, punting and running
down on punts, in which all the
candidates are showing a gradual
improvement in speed and alert
ness, the entire squad was divided
into two sections of two teams
each.
Coaches Lanagan and Slaker
each lined up a section, distributed
signals, and gave the men about
twenty minutes of rapid signal
practice as a medium step between
the light work of the past ten days
and the heavy scrimage work that
will be done from now on. In the
line-up of the past two days no
separation of Varsity and Fresh
man candidates was made, and
both sets were intermingled in the
four teams.
In addition to the paucity of
Varsity material from which the
coaches will be forced to choose a
line up for the Reliance game on the
19th comes the-news that half-back
Wilfred Dole, '05, is down with
malarial fever in theStudentGuild
Hospital in Palo Alto. How long
and how serious the attack will be
cannot be determined, but it will
be the means of keeping Dole off
the field for a week at least.
The sawdust ordered by Treasurer
Cowden has arrived and a coating
of it was placed over the field today.
