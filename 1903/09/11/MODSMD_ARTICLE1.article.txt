# NO GAME SATURDAY.
## Tackling and Signal Practice Take up Greater Part Of Last Night's Work. 
### 
The probability of a game Satur
day between the Freshmen and the
Santa Clara College eleven has been
removed owing to the inability of
the college players to come to the
campus. This postpones the first
game of the season until next
Wednesday, when the Freshmen
will meet either Santa Clara Col
lege or the University of the Pacific
team. The 19th remains as the
date for the first Varsity game
with Reliance Club.
In additionto the regular
practice of the last few days
the tackling bag was tried for
for the first time last night. Both
the coaches and Professor Lewers
took a team in hand and put the
men through simple formations.
Attention was centered on the
offensive work of the line-men.
The one thing that stands cut this
year more markedly than ever be
fore is the amount of emphasis
which Coach Lanagan has contin
na 11 v laid on the method of hand
ling the ball; especially in picking
up bounces and gathering in
fumbles.
