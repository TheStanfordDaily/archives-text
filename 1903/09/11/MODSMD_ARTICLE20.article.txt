# OUTLOOK IN TENNIS.
## Return of Old Men and Good Practice Courts Make Bright Prospects. 
### 
The prospects for a good tennis
team to meet that of the State
University in April are brighter
than for several years past. Al
ready the old and new courts are
in daily use, and some of last
year's players are engaged in ser
ious training. Of the old men
there are hack Baker, '04, who
represented Stanford in hoth sin
gles and doubles last April ; Hodge,
'0(j, who was kept out of the inter
collegiate contest only because of
sickness ; Uoyle, '04, Moore, '05,
Hopper, '05, A lien, "00, and Scoville,
'06. Weihe, '04, has played on
four intercollegiate tennis teams,
and so is not eligible. The Fresh
men who have appeared on the
courts have shown good form, so
that there is the probability of
developing some good material
from the class of 1907.
At the tirst meeting of the Tennis
Club the Sophomore class will
agitate the question of holding
tournaments and interclass meets.
There has heen an unusual amount
of interest displayed by the tennis
men this semester which a series
of interclass games would prob
ably bring to a very profitable
head.
