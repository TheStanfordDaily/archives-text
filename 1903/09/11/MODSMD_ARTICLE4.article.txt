# MAKE MANDOLIN CLUB.
## Try-out Brings Several New Men to the Front.— Proposed Northern Trip. 
### 
The try-out for places on this
year's Mandolin Club last evening
resulted in the selection of a club
that bids fair to rival last year's in
point of excellence. Of the large
number of candidates that compet
ed in the try-out the committee,
composed of W. H. Lanagan, '04,
leader of the club, N. E. Dole, '04,
and N. Collyer, '04, selected the
following men as the present make
up of the organization:
Mandolins —N. 10. Dole, '04, N.
Collyer, '04, W. H. Lanagan, '04,
H. Balkan, '04, R. N. Park, '04,
A. W. Hooper, '05, C. E. Cortes,
'05, J. W. Rosenfeld, '06, R. Ban
dini, '07, G. E. Dole, '07, Ferguson,
'07, Robertson, '07, G. McLain, '07.

'05, A. Rosenfeld, '07.
While no definite action has been
taken on the question of a holiday
trip for the Glee and Mandolin
Clubs, it is a matter of certainty
that a journey will be taken. It is
also almost a certainty that the
musicians will go north again, in
stead of to Southern California, as
has been the custom on alternate
years. The itinerary will embrace
practically the same cities as the
previous trip to Northern Califor
nia, Oregon, Washington, and Brit
ish Columbia, with the addition of
a few stops that, could not he made
last year and the omission of one
or two cities that were found to be
unprofitable fields. The tour will
cover the same time as last year.
Those of the Mandolin Club who
will take the northern trip will not
he selected until shortly before the
start. Those who were successful
in last night's try-out will consti
tute the club for the present. The
first make-up of the Glee Club will
