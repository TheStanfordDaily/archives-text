## House in Palo Alto Has Been Fitted up for Care of Sick. 
### 
The Students' Guild has rented
the house on the west corner of
Cowper street and Lytton avenue
in Palo Alto, anil is fitting it up as
a hospital. It is a two-story build
ing with a deep basement; in the
latter there is a kitchen, a dining
room, and a janitor's room; on the
first floor a reception room, an op
erating room connected with a pre
paratory room, a housekeeper's
room, a room for a patient, and a
bath room; on the second floor
are separate rooms for a nurse, a diet
kitchen, bath, and four rooms for
patients. There are now employed
a head nurse, an apprentice unrse,
a housekeeper, and a janitor.
Tentative arrangements have been
m;ide for securing another nurse as
soon as it may be necessary. Up
to the present time tbere have been
seven patients in the hospital, and
the intention is to fit out seven reg
ular beds and to provide for extra
beds in case of an emergency.
The equipment of the hospital is
still inadequate to the probable de
mands, and the Hoard is now en
gaged in supplying the necessary
additions as rapidly as possible.
The plan is to provide the patients
with everything that they need
their sickness, in a simple, econom
ical and thoroughly efficient man
ner, at the lowest possible cost to
themselves. The rate for the mem
bers of the Guild has been lixed,
for the present, at one dollar per
day, this to include bed, food, or
dinary nursing, and ordinary drugs,
but not doctors bills, special pre
scriptions, special nursing and the
use of the operating room. The
latter is not equipped as yet, and
when t his is done an especial charge
for its use will be announced. Ar
rangements are also made to ex
tend the privileges of the hospital
to the members of the faculty and
their families.
The present needs of the hospital
are many in number, and there is
a chance for everyone to help fill
them by such donations as he is
able to make. Anything in the
way of washable curtains, inex
pensive rugs that may be destroyed
in case of infection, bed spreads, a
chiffonier, chiffonier covers, bed
screens, chairs for the patients such
as light rattan, easy or rocking
chairs and piazza chairs, and read
ing matter of any kind, will be very
much appreciated and may be sent
directly to the hospital or to Miss
Kimball, 18 Salvatierra street, or to
J. P. Mitchell, 951 Bryant street.
The head nurse at the hospital is
Miss Grace L. Shepard, who during
the epidemic last year was head
nurse at the hospital in Encina.
Miss Shepard came down on the
first private case at the beginning
of the epidemic and remained until
I the end as head nurse at the central
i hospital on Lytton avenue. The
housekeeper is Miss Effie G. Cady
who before coming here occupied a
similar position at a private hos
pital in Massachusetts.
