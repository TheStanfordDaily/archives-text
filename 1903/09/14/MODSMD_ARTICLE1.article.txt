# FIRST GAME WEDNESDAY.
## Actual Football Season to Start With Preliminary Freshman Contest. 
### 
The first football game of the
season of 1903 will he played on the
•oval Wednesday afternoon between
the Freshmen and either the Santa
Clara College eleven or a team from
the University of the Pacific. The
initial scrimmage work of the year
was gone through this afternoon by
the candidates for the 1907 team.
With but two days' hard practice
work thehal vesof Wednesday's game
will be short. Either team that
comes will be a fair match for the
Freshmen, a nd the contest promises
to be close and interesting,although
the Freshmen may suffer from lack
of team work due to their short
period of practice.
At Saturday's practice Head-
Coach Lanagan gave all the candi
dates to distinctly understand that
no man who was not provided with
ankle-braces, head-guards, shin
guards, nose-guards, and heavy
shoulder-pads would be allowed to
play in heavy practice or prelimi
nary games. This precaution will
eliminate to a large degree the ex
perience of former years when
several valuable players have been
kept from the intercollegiate games
owing to breaks and bruises sus
tained in the less important prelim
inary contests. It is not purposed
to send the men heavily armored
into the big game, but to have them
wear every possible protection up
to the date of the contest with Cali
fornia.
At. California the Varsity team
has been working for a week with
its line-up, probably very much as
it will appear in the Intercollegiate.
The State University team, as it
now stands, is as follows: Stroud,
center; Stowe and Overall, guards;
Howard and Force, tackles; I)e
-merritt and Hudson, ends; Geary,
quarter; Ilisley and Whipple,
halves; Stern, full-back.
Treasurer Cowden was in San
Francisco today to confer with
Manager Decoto of California rela
tive to a schedule of games, which
has not been arranged before owing
to the failure of the University of
Southern California to set a date
for the arrival of its team.
