With the life of a custom as
old as the University itself at
stake, it may be well to ask at this
time what is meant by the quad
rangle. Tradition tells us that
there has been at Stanford an un
written law against smoking in or
on the quad. We take it to mean
that the quad refers to the Univer
sity buildings used for class-room
purposes, and that as the buildings
spread over greater area so does
the no-smoking custom expand.
The rather flagrant violation prac
ticed of late by some students who
use the ten-minute intermission
between classes for the purpose of
smoking on the ground between
the inner and the outer quad,
should, in the light of custom and
respect, be corrected. Some more
thoughtless students have gone so
far as to smoke within two feet of
the arcade of the inner quadrangle.
This is certainly an inexcusable
breach and disregard for both the
spirit and letter of a tradition that
had its beginning in a respectful
regard for the institution.
