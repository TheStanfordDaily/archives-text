# Delay in Building Work.
## 
### 
The present cessation of stone
work on the new University build
ings is only temporary, but no
arrangements for putting back to
work the entire force of stone
masons have as yet been made.
The greater number of the men
who went back to work recently
after the settlement of the strike
which was called during the sum
mer are at present idle, but a few
are being employed on the im
provements in Memorial Church.
It is expected that this work will
be completed at an early date. A
force of carpenters is carrying on
their work at the new Gymnasium,
but beside these operations nothing
is being done there. Rumors have
been circulating for some time that
all the stone workers on the build
ings were to be laid off for six
months owing to labor troubles,
but no definite move has as yet
been made by the contractors in
charge of the University work.
