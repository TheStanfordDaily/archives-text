# "Alumnus" in New Form.
## 
### 
The initial number of the fifth
volume of the Stanford Alumnus
appeared on Friday. For the first
time in its career the graduates'
paper comes out a weekly instead
of a monthly publication.
The greater portion of the space
is devoted to the address of Mrs.
Stanford upon her inauguration as
president of the Board of Trustees,
July 6, 1903. There is a long ar
ticle on the change in the location
of the departments in the quad
rangle, and the usual alumni notes
occupy some considerable portion
of the issue. Editorially J. T. Bur
cham, '97, chairman of the execu
tive committee of the Stanford
Alumni Association, tells why the
change in form was made.
The organ of the graduates, in
stead of its old book form, now
appears in newspaper dress. Du
plications and inaccuracies in
names and dates show hasty work
and poor proof-reading.
