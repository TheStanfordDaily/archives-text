# OLYMPIAN GAMES SCHEDULE.
## Events Arranged for Great Meet at Louisiana Purchase Exposition 
### 
The dates and the schedules for
the Olympian games to be given at
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition
in St. Louis next year have all
been completed by the games com
mittee of the Amateur Athletic
Union. The contests will begin
Monday, August 29, 1904, and con
tinue until September 3d. As the
Olympic running events will be
measured by the metric system, the
time records established in the dis
tance events will be of little interest
to athletes accustomed to the
American measurements. The han
dicap events that are to be run
separately, but during the same
week as the championship events,
will be measured by the American
system.
The official program follows:

In pursuance of their plan for
sending a team of representative
Pacific Coast athletes to participate
in the Olympian games, the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association will
hold the second try-out Friday,
October 16, 1903. This meet will
also decide the indoor track and
field championship of the Pacific
Coast. It is to be held in San
Francisco at the Mechanics' Pavil
ion. This coming meet is creating
considerable interest among Stan
ford track men, and before the
week is over several of them will be
seen on the track in active prepara
tion for the try-out. Thomson,'o4,
Dole, '04, Beach, '04, Lovell, '06,

and several others will in all prob
ability train for the meet. The
fact that Dunn, '04, will not be
able to participate in the coming
meet, owing to pressure of work,
has caused general regret, as his
recent breaking of the Coast 440
record led many to helieve him
capable of still better time at that
distance.
