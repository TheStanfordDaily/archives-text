# LECTURE ON FORESTRY.
## Gifford Pinchot Gives Interesting Address in Chapel Friday Evening. 
### 
Gifford Pinchot, chief of the
United States Bureau of Forestry,
lectured in the chapel Friday eve
ning, on "Forestry as a profession."
He began by speaking of the outlook
of forestry in California, and point
ed out the great amount of work to
be done in this state.
In speaking of forestry as a pro
fession, the lecturer said, in part:
"There is great demand for foresters,
—a demand which is constantly in
creasing. Each state must have
head foresters, and from the Phil
ippines comes an urgent demand
for such men. Individual forest
owners will also find it to their ben
efit to employ foresters, and the
result will be that the demand for
men will far exceed the supply for
years to come. Forestry in many
ways is an opportunity for the ex
ceptional man.
Forestry is a scientific profession
to be dealt with from the stand
point of science and business. Men
for this work need a thorough
training in chemistry, geology,
entomology, zoology, botany, sur
veying, and must have efficient
knowledge of the political and eco
nomic history of the United States.
The student must also acquire a
good knowledge of law, especially
business law.
The knowledge of lumber is more
nearly related to forestry than is
botany. Practice work in the woods
is very necessary.
The forest policy is of very im
portant consideration at the present
time. The future forest policy will
be governed in a great measure by
the one of today, so it is absolutely
necessary that we have the very
best of men to frame the orig
inal policy. I do not want to
encourage men to take up this pro
fession without a full relation of
the advantages to be encountered
on their part. While for the next
ten years there will be an extra
ordinary demand for foresters, there
will come a time, I think, when the
interest in the subject will lag, but
after a short period the interest
will again revive. Men in this de
partment will be paid about as
much as university instructors.
There is a great need of forestry
schools in this country. There are
now only two, one at Yale, and one
at the University of Michigan.
These are both two-year postgrad
uate schools. I think all forestry
schools should be for postgraduate
work, and the students entering
should have their degrees of A. B.
and A.M. There is a great need of
a school of this kind here on the
Pacific Coast, and I think the time
is not far distant when there will
be one.
