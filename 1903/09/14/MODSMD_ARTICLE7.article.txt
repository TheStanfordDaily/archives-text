# SUNDAY MORNING SERVICE.
## Rev. F.L. Hosmer Speaks On " Success and Failure in Life." 
### 
The sermon 011 Sunday morning
was preached by the Rev. F. L.
Hosmer, a Unitarian minister of
Herkeiey. Rev. Hosmer talked on
"Success and Failure in Life," tak
ing as his text Matthew 4: 9: "And
the devil saith unto him: All these
things will 1 give thee, if thou wilt
fall down and worship me."
He began by analyzing what
constitutes the question of success
and failure, and spoke of the prac
tical concern that the question bore
to every life. Some ideal of what
one would be and of what would
be accomplished seems essential to
any steadiness of pursuit. The
days must be strung on some thread
of purpose, or life becomes broken
up and disintegrated instead of
cumulative in its movement.
Rev. Hosmer spoke of the values
of the markets as the readiest
measure of failure and success, es
pecially at the present time. He
said: "How much has the merchant
made from his merchandise, the
farmer from his fields, the mechanic
from his skilled labor, or the physi
cian from his practice? This ques
tion is pertinent only from one
point of view, and surely not un
important. Let its answer give us
report of these persons as merchant,
farmer, mechanic or physician
only. That is, it gives us one phase
only of their lives and not their
lives as wholes. It does not neces
sarily tell us of the inner spirit, the
methods and manifold influences
that have been called into play,
and what has been the effect of all
this upon the man himself. Jt
gives strength and comfort to feel
that amid all this mingled circum
stance of life there are finer tests of
failure and success than appear
on the surface, and that seeming
defeat and loss have turned to sig
nal triumph and gain in the final
account."
"There are men," he said, "in
prominent social positions, and in
public life, in whom their merited
place has enlarged thought and vis
ion, has deepened the sense of re
sponsibility, has broadened charac
ter, has strengthened their whole
nature; to whom exceptional respon
sibilities have been given as a
school of instruction and as a thea
tre for larger performance. These
are truly successful lives, both
within and without."
Chaplain D. Charles Gardner
preached the afternoon sermon.
He took as his subject, "Rever
ence," and talked on the Ten Com
mandments, showing that there
was a sense of reverence in each.
