# REPORT OF GUILD.
## General Account of Work, With List of Donations and Expenses. 
### 
The following report of the oper
ations of the Students' Guild at the
time of the typhoid epidemic has
been prepared by II. A. Moran, '04,
who up to recently wan president
of the organization. The report
throws the first light on the exten
sive philanthropic work that was
carried on during the fever struggle
of last spring. The report follows:
A meeting of the Guild board
was held at Dr. Snow's ollice on the
21st of May, 1903. Dr. Jordan, Dr.
Gilbert, Professor Sanford, and Dr.
Snow were present, besides the stu
dent members of the board.
Frank L. Hess, '03, resigned as
president, and Hugh A. Moran, 04,
was elected to take his place until
the appointment of a successor.
Dr. W. F. Snow, representing the
faculty committee, and Moran, rep
resenting the students, were consti
tuted the Guild Board, with full
power to act in all Guild affairs.
This board were instructed to rent
a house in Palo Alto, and to make
all other arrangements necessary
for the opening of a hospital with
the reopening of the University,
provided it did not spend a sum
greater than five hundred dollars
beyond cash in hand, which sum
-would he amply covered by prop
erty and apparatus already belong
ing to the Guild.
As the work was continuous and
no report was made public at
the change of management, this
account will deal with the affairs
of the Guild from the opening of
the Encina Hospital on April 14th
to the closing of the work on .July
4th.

During that time there were
eleven patients treated at the En
cina Hospital, eleven at the Main
Hospital at 481 Lytton avenue,
Palo Alto, and eight at the
temporary hospital at 845 Waverly
street. Besides these thirty patients
in our local hospitals, there
were four in Lane Hospital, San
Francisco, four others for whom
we paid entirely or in part, and
eight homes, some of them with
several patients, where sick-room
appliances were provided. As far as
can be learned, but three of those
who were in our local hospitals
were members of the Guild at the
time they were taken sick.
The financial report is given
below:

Other sources, in smaller
amounts, chiefly donated

Palo Alto and elsewhere. .728 38
Grand total $5672 41
This in no way includes the
amount of nearly $3000 expended
by Mrs. Stanford for nursing, nor
the fund handled by the Guild for
the convalescence of those who
needed help in that way.
The main items of expense were
as follows:
Nursing $1819 55
Drugs 794 90
Furniture and permanent
supplies 695 98
Running expenses of hos
pitals, including rent, fuel,
labor, livery, board of
nurses, etc 2335 68
Balance on hand, July 4th.. 26 30
$5672 41
The running expenses would
have been much larger had they
not been reduced by donations.
Certain items agreed upon by
the board, including nursing not
paid for by Mrs. Stanford, drugs,
and general running expenses at
the hospitals, were tabulated, and
as accurate an account as could he
made in each case was sent to the
different patients. Thirty-one bills,
aggregating $3641.87, were sent out
on July 1st., leaving six which for
different reasons have not or will
not be sent. Three of these, to the
extent of $376.90, have been paid
in full, and others of the patients

have either made payments on ac
count, or signified their intention
of doing so. Thirteen notes have
been signed covering that number
of accounts, and of the remaining
fifteen, eight have been heard from
who intend to adjust their accounts.
It was hoped lo put the money
thus returned into a permanent
emergency fund, but as funds were
needed immediately to prepare the
hospital for its present opening, it
was found necessary to loan this
money to the GuiliJ for present use.
The total funds in hand at the mid
dle of August amounted to $415.39.
Of this $76.55 was expended on old
bills and current expenses, and
$250 on repairs and improvements
at the hospital. This leaves a
balance of $88.84 in the treasury,
with outstanding bills of $92.10, and
an indebtedness on the house of
$200.
As was consistent with our in
structions at the meeting in May,
we have made whatever arrange
ments were absolutely necessary
for the opening of the hospital at
the present time. They include
the following:
The rental of the premises at 481
Lytton avenue for one year with the
privilege of a renewal at the same
rate, which is $450.
The repair and improvement of
said premises to the extent of $450,
$50 additional to be taken from the
rent, and an understanding that
the house be painted by the owners.

This report cannot be closed with
out mention of the tireless efforts of
Dr. Snow, who, though no more
responsible than the rest of the
community, has used his time day
and night, his professional knowl
edge, and his own private means,
in managing this typhoid epidemic,
and all without thought of any
remuneration. It is impossible to
enumerate all those by whose aid
the successful completion of this
work was made possible, but'we
must at least offer a word of thanks
to Mrs. J. E. Matzke, who during
the critical period acted as resident
physician at Lytton avenue hospi
tal; to Mrs. Gilbert, who spent
hours daily looking after the details
of the hospital management; and
to the many other ladies who for
weeks provided broth and other
things needed in our work.
Respectfully submitted,
Sept. 14, 1903. Hugii A. Moran.
