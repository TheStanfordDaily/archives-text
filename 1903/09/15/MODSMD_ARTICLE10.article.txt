The report of the Guild presi
dent reveuls some very interesting
information that comes as a genu
ine source of surprise and gratifica
tion to everyone. It sheds the first
general light on the extensive char
itable work that was done hy
friends of the University during
the typhoid epidemic. Many of
the donations came under promise
of secrecy, and the college as a
whole knew nothing of the philan
thropic zeal displayed. It is uni
versally appreciated in what a
helpless condition the Guild would
have had to face the epidemic were
it not for the commendable loyalty
shown by friends of the institution.
While those who contributed money
and supplies were individually
thanked by those in charge of the
Guild, no acknowledgment by the
students could be made before this,
and we take this means to thank
those numerous and loyal friends
of the University who responded so
generously when their help was
most needed. Every friend of the
University appreciates the thought
ful regard that these persons
showed. Mrs. Stanford's quiet and
unostentatious benefactions during
the trouble were only another evi
dence of her abiding love for the
students.
