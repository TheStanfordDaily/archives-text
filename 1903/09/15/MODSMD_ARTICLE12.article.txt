# BACK FROM ALASKA.
## Dr. Gilbert Returns from Investigating Fisheries in Northern Waters. 
### 
Dr. C. H. Gilbert, of the Zoology
department, returned to the Uni
versity this morning, after three
months' service on the United
States Fish Commission in Alaska.
He arrived in San Francisco last
night on the steamer President, a
packing vessel of the Alaska Salmon
Company. Dr. Barton W. Ever
mann, chief ichthyologist of the
United States Fish Commission,
also arrived from the northern
waters last night, and spent the
day at Stanford on his way to
Washington, D. C. He will resume
his journey eastward tomorrow
morning. After Dr. Jordan left the
Alaskan commission this summer
to return to the University, Dr.
Evermann took charge of the work
until its recent completion.
Both of the returned scientists
report marked success in the inves
tigations of the commission, which
was sent out to determine the best
way of regulating the salmon in
dustry in the northern waters. It
was found that the annual "pack"
of fish is decreasing each year, and
in view of this fact the commission
ers will recommend that extensive
government hatcheries be estab
lished throughout the territory.
This report will be submitted to
the next Congress.
During the summer Dr. Gilbert
was in charge of a special party on
the mainland in the region of
Bristol Bay. All the canneries and
salteries in that part of Alaska
were carefully inspected. The ex
pedition under Dr. Jordan and Dr.
Evermann visited the principal
islands of the archipelago, and at
tended to the work of murine col
lecting on the Albatross.
The principal members of the
commission, besides Dr. Jordan,
Dr. Gilbert, and Dr. Evermann,
were as follows: Captain Swift, of
the Albatross; J. N. Wisner, super
intendent of the government fish
hatcheries in Oregon and Wash
ington; A. B. Alexander, in charge
of statistics and methods; and
Cloudsley Rutter, naturalist.
Among the assistants were Dr. H.
Heath, Harold B. Jordan, ex-'O4,
and F. M. Chamberlain, of the
Fish Commission.
