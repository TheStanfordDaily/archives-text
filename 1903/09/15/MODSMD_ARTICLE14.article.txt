# WILL LECTURE ON PLAY.
## Members of English Department Faculty to Speak on Coming Productions. 
### 
Thursday evening at 7:30 Profes
sor Melville Best Anderson, head of
the English department, will lecture
in the chapel on "Tweltfh Night,"
which will be presented by Ben
Greet's company in Assembly Hall
September 2nd. Mr. Edward K.
Putnam, also of the English de
partment, will speak on "Every
man" after the lecture by Professor
Anderson.
The extraordinary interest felt
in the revival of this fifteent hcen
tury drama has been equally
marked in Great Britain and Amer
ica. There have been in all nearly
two hundred presentations in Lon
don, over one hundred in New
York, and many others in Boston,
Philadelphia, and San Francisco.
Most of the Eastern universities
have invited the director to give
performances especially for their
students.
The play of "Everyman" was
written for a distinctively religious
purpose, but incidentally it has the
vivid qualities of a powerful story.
It might be called a sort of drama
tized "Pilgrim's Progress" of the
days before the age of Protestant
ism, and its unknown author, like
Bunyan, was able to give his alle
gorical characters such vitality
that they hold the interest of a
modern audience from first to last.
This strong popular interest is one
side of the play; on the other side,
there is no question but that we
have in it the finest opportunity
to study that peculiar form of
drama —the "Morality" — which
linked the earlier Bibical plays of
the church to the secular drama of
the sixteenth century. Dr. Horace
Howard Furness, the great Shak
sperean scholar, recently wrote an
open letter urging "every student of
dramatic literature, every lover of
the drama, every reader of the his
tory of manners and customs, every
student of theological history," to
see "Everyman" if possible.
The costumes of the Elizabethan
Stage Society form perhaps the
most elaborate collection of the
kind now in use anywhere. Those
made for this play were designed
from BTemish tapestries of the fif
teenth century, and are remarkably
effective. The figure of "Death" in
particular is a marvellous triumph
of the designer, and of itself suffi
ciently rewards the observer of the
play by its representation of the
spirit of grotesque mediaeval art.
while the procession of the other
characters, as Everyman approach
es his grave, is like an ancient
monkish painting animated with
life and motion.
