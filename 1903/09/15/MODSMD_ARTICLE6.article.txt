The Freshmen Inst night had
their first line-up of the season
and all went into the play in
earnest. Stott, quarter; Chalmers,
half; Dole, full; and Wei ler, tackle,
showed up well. The scrimmage
work lasted too short a time to
give all the men a fair trial at the
game, but tonight's practice offered
a better opportunity to see
how much of the training of the
past two weeks the new men are
able to put into actual playing.
In place of a preliminary game
between the Varsity and the Uni
versity of Oregon, Treasurer Cow
den has scheduled a game with the
Multnomah Athletic Club team of
Portland, Oregon. The game will
be played on the campus Novem
ber 7th. Multnomah hns the
strongest football eleven in the
Northwest, and the contest with
Stanford will be interesting both
in regard to the result and more
because it is the final preliminary
game for the Varsity before it
meets California. The club team
will also meet California on the
4t.li of November.
Ralph McFadden, ex-'O4, Varsi
ty tackle for the past three years,
was on the field last night assisting
Slaker in coaching the Freshman
squad.
