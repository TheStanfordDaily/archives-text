# Gymnasium Notes.
## 
### 
—Hereafter all cuts from the regu
lar gymnasium classes will be
made up on Saturdays from 11:30
to 12:15. As it will be very incon
venient for a large majority of the
students to report at this time, it is
expected that absences from gym
nasium classes will he greatly re
duced.
—All the lockers in Encina gym
nasium are occupied, and a num
ber of students are without them.
It is hoped by the management
that some of the students who live
in Encina Hall will give up their
lockers to the men who live at a
distance from the campus.
—Trainer Moulton will meet
next Monday the gymnasium men
who have signed up for track work.
Before that date Dr. Storey hopes
to evolve some plan so that gymna
sium and track work may harmo
nize.
