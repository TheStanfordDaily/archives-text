# RELIANCE IN PRACTICE.
## Twenty â€“ Three Old Players From Whom Club Team Will be Drawn. 
### 
In preparation for the game
against (Stanford next Saturday,
the Reliance Athletic Club football
squad is doing regular daily prac
tice at the Han Francisco Riding
Academy. Heretofore the manage
ment of the club team has found it
difficult to get enough men to fill
out a single eleven, but this year
twenty-three men are being tried
out for the positions. Another ele
ment which will give the club team
an additional advantage this sea
son is the fact that the men are
getting a good opportunity for prac
tice, instead of being sent into
games with but two or three days'
team work.
Several candidates for the Reli
ance team are well-known in foot
ball circles. Atkinson, full-back
and captain, has played with the
clubmen for several years past.
Cavanaugh, center on the Univer
sity of Chicago in 1898, will play
his old position. In 181)8 Cava
naugh was named as substitute for
center on the All-Amerioan team.
Smock, who played center on the
University of Illinois in 1900, will
appear in the Reliance line as
guard. Holt, of the Williamette
University and Portland Y. M.C. A.
teams, will play quarter. Three
candidates for half-back are Geis
slerj of the Stanford 1901 squad,
Mueller of Purdue University, and
Woodbridge, who has played with
Vanderbilt University and the
University of Texas elevens. Gra
ham, full-back on Santa Clara last
year; Magee, half-back on last
year's Stanford Varsity; Gaffey, an
old Reliance player; and McDon
ough of Berkeley are all trying for
places on the eleven.
Football practice on the campus
has settled into an even routine.
The work consists of falling on the
ball, trialsjat the tackling-bag, and
signal practice to develope team
work in the simple formations.
Coach Lanagan is devoting most
of his attention to the Varsity
squad, while the candidates for the
Freshman team have been divided
into squads that are doing signal
practice under the guidance of vol
unteer coaches. There is every
evidence that any man who plays
on the Varsity elevens will be
thoroughly grounded in the fine
points of the game, as the different
formations are being taken one at
a time and mastered before another
is attempted.
The Freshman squad has been
showing up in good form. There

are a number of strong players who
appear to be available for the
Varsity. The ten-minute line-up
between the two Freshman squads
last night showed that there are
Some strong men behind the line,
while there appears to be a lack of
guards and tackles.
