### 
Prof. Melville Best Anderson and
Mr. E. K. Putnam of the English
department will speak in the chapel
Thursday evening on the two plays
that will come to Stanford next
week. Although their talks will
in the main he strictly confined to
a discussion of the respective plays,
the Elizabethan Stage Society and
the part it played in the original
production of "Everyman" will in
all probability be touched upon.
The Elizabethan Stage Society
began through the agency of Dr.
Ward of Peterhouse College, Cam
bridge. The society was composed
largely of idealistic actors about
London. It is the society's pur
pose to revive and present forgotten
English plays, one of which it is
customary to present every year in
London, at Oxford, or Cambridge,
or other schools. It was in 1902
that Dr. Ward, in his researches
connected with completing a work
on the English drama,discovered t he
old morality play "Everyman" and
brought its merits to the attention
of this society through Mr. Poel,
who was at that time head of the
organization. Hen Greet was en
gaged to supervise the production
of "Everyman" in company with
the society and Mr. Poel. The
present conception of the drama is
due to the efforts of these two men.
The play was first given five nights
in London to rather disappointing
audiences. The society, however,
was soon encouraged by the im
pression the play began to make
upon London. Since that time it
has been presented thousands of
times in England, Scotland, and
Ireland, being only recently
brought to this country.
