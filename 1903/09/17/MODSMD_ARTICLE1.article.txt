"To members of the Inn Club:
"As you are doubtless aware, the
Inn Club last year incurred tin in
debtedness of approximately $2500,
for which the members of the club
are legally responsible, and for the
payment of which no provision lias
as yet been made by the club. The
assets of the club can probably bo
sold for not more than $300. Time
has been given the club since the
opening of the University to take
action looking toward a settlement
of this indebtedness. As no action
has yet been taken by the club, the
following decision has been arrived
at by the University authorities:
"Unless evidence is presented to
the President by September 24th
inst. showing that $1000 has been
raised by members of the club to
lie applied to the payment of this
indebtedness, each member of the
club in the University is to pay to
G. A. Clark, secretary of the Uni
versity, nt room 111, by September
25th, the sum of $10. Members
who do not comply with this
arrangement, will have their regis
tration in the University cancelled
and will be registered only on pay
ment of the amount specified, to
gether with the usual fees for late
registration.
''The club will then be given un
til October 15th next to arrange in
some manner satisfactory to the
President for the payment of the
remainder of the indebtedness. In
default of action by the club to this
end, the President will on October
20th call for the payment in cash
by each member in the University
of such further amount as may be
necessary to cancel his responsi
bility in the premises.
"Very truly yours,
"David S. Jordan, President."
A meeting of the members of the
club was called for tonight to dis
cuss methods of paying of the debt
of the organization. The possibility
of keeping the Inn open under the
present conditions was to come up
for discussion. The finances are
just keeping even, without taking
into consideration the charges for
rent, water and light that must be
met at the end of the first month.
