# FRESHMEN LINE UP.
## Fast Practice Game Between Two Elevens.â€” Palo Alto Did Not Play. 
### 
The game scheduled to be played
by the Freshman and the Palo Alto
high school teams yesterday was
not held. A misunderstanding as
to suits for the visiting players
was responsible for the cancelling
of the game. Some of the high
school players were without suits,
and arrived upon the campus too
late to be fitted out hy Manager
Cow den.
In place of the scheduled game,
two Freshman teams lined up for
a short practice scrimmage. Neith
er side was able to score, as the
team work was of too ragged a
nature to allow one side to gain
consistently. Although the 1907
players showed hut little cohesion
in their formations, the elements
of the game that Coach Lanagan
has been drilling into them for the
past two weeks came to the surface
last night. There whs an abun
dance of fumbling, but every man
attempted to fall on the ball, and not
pick it up on the chance of a gain.
The work of the backs and ends
was of a superior order, but in the
line, either because of poor mater
ial or because of poor team work,
there was shown a lack of improve
ment. The halves were of short
duration, but nearly every Fresh
man on the squad was gi veil achance
in the game. Several of the Fresh
men showed up well for the firpt
time hut no conclusion as to their
making a team can be drawn from
this early work. The line-up fol

Crutcher 1 e r West

After the Freshmen left the field
the Varsity candidates were given
a short scrimmage. The contest
was slow because the coaches were
busy in correcting bad formations
and teaching the men the fine
points of the game.
The practice of this afternoon
was the last chance the Varsity
had to get in shape for the Reliance
game Saturday. If the clubmen
are as strong as they are reported
to be, the game may be a surprise
to those who are sure of a Cardinal
victory, as the development of
team work among the Stanford
players is still in an elementary
stage.
