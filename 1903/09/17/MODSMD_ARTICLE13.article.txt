# ARGUMENT OF "EVERYMAN."
## The 						Morality Play One of the Most Perfect Allegories Ever Formed. 
### 
The play of "Everyman" which
will he presented in Assembly Hall
next Monday night is a hit of a
past century transferred hodily to
the present era. The costumes are
designed from Flemish tapestries
of the fifteenth century, the music
is of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, and the whole production
is as nearly as possible a revival of
the Elizabethan era in the drama.
The action of the play, while it
takes one hour and forty minutes,
is continuous, so that the audience
is expected to keep quiet in order
that they may not interrupt the
performance by applause.
The argument of "Everyman" is
as follows : After an announcement
by a messenger, God opens the
play with the assertion that, as
men are so drowned in sin and
cumbered with riches, that he has
decided to have a rekenynge of
every mannes persone. He bids
Dethe, His mighty messengere, tell
Everyman to prepare for his last
pilgrimage. Everyman tries by
pleadings and bribes to obtain a
respite, but gets only permission to
take companions if he can find any
handy enough. Fellowship, notic
ing Everyman's grief, asks its
cause, vowing his readiness to die
for him, but when he hears his
friend's request he refuses to go
with him. Appeals to Kynrede and
Cosin are no'more successful, and
Goodes (Property) simply mocks
at Everyman's distress. In despair
Everyman seeks his long neglected
friend Good Dedes, who though
so bound by his sins that she can
not stir, consents to do all she can
for him. She introduces him to
Knowledge, who offers to be his
guide. She brings him before Con
fession. The ardor of his suppli
cations and the severity of his
penance free Good Dedes so that
she can go with him on his jour
ney. Having received the sacra
ment, Everyman sets forth as a
pilgrim accompanied by Beaute,
Strength, Dyscrecion and Fyve
W'yttes. At the grave these four
desert him, but Good Dedes and
Knowledge support him as he en
ters the tomb. Everyman sinks
into the grave commending himself
to God. An Aungell is heard sing
ing his welcome to heaven; and the
Doctour brings the play to a close
by pointing its moral.
