Editor Daily Pai.o Alto:
I, us <t woman of the Class of 1905,
wish to state that the action taken
by the Junior girls in regard to
caps and gowns is not unanimous.
In my opinion they have done that
for which they should feel heartily
ashamed. The cap and gown at
Stanford belongs distinctively to
the Seniors, and for my part I hope
that the Senior girls will protest
vigorously. 1905.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The protest in Wednesday's issue
regarding the adoption of caps and
gowns by the Junior girls will not
be "followed up by the unanimous
opinion of 1904." 1904 is quite
likely to he divided on the ques
tion. Allow me to follow the pro
test by a single expression of ap
probation.
The wearing of the senior som
brero is a peculiar privilege, and a
custom characteristic of this Uni
versity. The wearing of the cap
and gown is a custom common to
colleges and universities the world
over. At Bryn Mawr, the woman's
college of Baltimore, and certain
other recognized institutions, the
cap and gown are worn through all
four years. The class distinction
is maintained by wearing the tassel
on the front right-hand side for
freshmen, and moving it back one
side each year, until the form now
used by our seniors is reached.
The cap and gown seems not so
much an honor as a definition of
one's university status. But those
who regard it as an honor will lose
nothing, since the tassel will show
the amount of work accomplished.
I think that the girls of 1905
were led to the action by the
thoughtfulness oi a few who are
looking forward to the day when
the universal use of cap and gown,
for men and women alike, will lend
an increased academic atmosphere
to our arcades. Not to be peculiar,
but to stand abreast of the older
institutions in all worthy customs,
should be our aim. The cap and
gown is the badge of the student
and scholar. Its use is hallowed
by tradition and respected by all
the world. To attempt to appro
priate it to the permanent use of
one class is an attempt with the
weight of argument on the negative
side. Senior.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Y. M. C. A. Student Em
ployment Bureau is prepared to
take copy for the typewriting de
partment, several men having
passed rigid examinations testing
their ability to do good work of this
nature. We wish to call attention
to the fact that considerable money
is being lost by persons who tran
scribe their own themes, stories, re
ports, and theses. Ordinarily the
time of one who is writing is worth
20 cents per hour, and many stu
dents cannot afford to rewrite their
manuscripts when they can have
280 words typewritten for 10 cents.
The typewriting department has
aimed to furnish a medium through
which employers may have work
done well without losing time in
searching for efficient typists.
Copy forwarded to me at
the University, or left at the
employment office, room HO quad,
will be placed in the hands of men
who are well qualified to do good
work promptly. H. F. Coolidge.
