# INN WILL PROBABLY CLOSE.
## Members of Corporation Meet and Appoint Committee to Confer with. Dr. Jordan. 
### 
The members of the Inn Club
met last night and decided in favor
of a pro rata assessment in order
that the affairs of the association
may be closed up as soon as possi
ble. No assessment was author
ized, however, as it was thought
advisable to appoint a committee
to consult with Dr. Jordan as to
his attitude in the matter. From
the notice served on the sharehold
ers yesterday it was impossible to
know whether the University
authorities stood in favor of a pro
rata levy on all members in or out
of college, or of holding those now
in college for the entire debt. The
committee appointed by Chairman
Merrill to see Dr. Jordan is
J. If. Page, '03, W. B. Chandler,
'04, and L. D. Byrne, '05, chair
man. This committee was also
charged to secure an appraisal of
all property now held by the Club,
and to see what measures can be
taken to dispose of it.
According to the special law
under which the Inn Club is incor
porated, the organization is a co
operative association with power to
issue membership tickets. It is not
a stock company. The members
are liable to the extent of one share
only. The association may close
its legal existence by a two-thirds
vote of the members, after the in
debtedness of those members has
been cancelled.
The club has issued in its year
and a half of existence two hundred
and thirty-three membership tick
ets, but forty-eight were redeemed
May, 1902, leaving the present
membership of one hundred and
eighty-five. One hundred and six
members are now in college. The
liabilities of the corporation amount
to $2,370, and the assetß are under
$300. Each member will therefore
be held for about $11.50.
Some doubts exist as to the
status of those members who have
transferred their shares. The law
requires that the original purchas
ers be liable unless the transfer
is validated by a vote of the
directors of the association, and it
seems impossible to determine
now whether such action was
taken.
Chairman Merrill reported that
the creditors in San Francisco stood
ready to advance further credit to
the Club only after $1,000 was
raised and paid to them, but the
sentiment of the meeting was in
favor of closing up the Club with
all possible speed. The committee
will report at a meeting to be held
Saturday evening at 7:30, and the
Club will then decide upon the
method of paying its indebted
ness.
Dr. Jordan, when seen last
night after the meeting, said that
the circular letter must have been
misinterpreted, for the individual
members of the Inn Club will be
held only for the payment of the
amount for which they are legally
responsible; that is, for an amount
rpaehed by apportioning the entire
sum among all the original mem
bers of the organization.
