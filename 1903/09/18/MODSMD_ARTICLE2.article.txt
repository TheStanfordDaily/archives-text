# ASSEMBLY MONDAY.
## Ben Greet Will Speak on "Drama," and Professor Newcomer on "Morality Play." 
### 
The date of the semi-monthly
Assembly has been changed to the
fourth hour on Monday in order
that there may be an opportunity
to hear Ben Greet speak on the
drama and the subject which his
work most closely approaches, the
revival of the Elizabethan play.
Mr. Greet's formal topic will be
"The Drama," while Professor New
comer will take for his subject "The
Elizabethan Stage Society."
As the life work of tlve English
visitor has been devoted to the re
vival of the old plays for the artis
tic and literary qualities they pos
sess, he may be expected to dwell
particularly on this phase of the
drama. His special aim has been
to revive the custom of open-air
productions, and his "Group of
Pastoral Players" have been seen
more frequently in open-air pro
ductions of the old plays than in
modernly equipped theaters. The
position which Mr. Greet holds in
the artistic and theatrical world is
surety that his talk will be from
the standpoint of an authority.
