Mr. Edward Berwick, president
of the California Postal Progress
League, lectured this morning in
the chapel on the "Parcel Post of
the United States," and gave a
comparison with the system in
other countries. He showed that
the postal service of this country is
greatly inferior to that of Germany,
England, and Mexico, both in re
gard to efficiency and rates. He
explained the importance of estab
lishing a more thorough system of
the parcel post in order to reduce
the rates in sending articles through
the mail, and so facilitate commer
cial intercourse. Germany by the
aid of her cheaper parcel post is
taking commerce away from the
United States. Mexico and Eng
land are in Germany's position.
As an example of this, the Mexican
can send an eleven-pound package
through the mail to Alaska for
three dollars and twenty-three
cents less than can an American,
and a German for three dollars and
thirty-one cents leas.
The United States has parcel
post agreements with only thirty
one cities, chiefly of the smaller
countries, while both Mexico and
Germany have two hundred and
thirty-four. England also has a
service vastly superior to that of
the United States. Most of the
foreign rates to different countries
show that a person in this country
has to pay about six hundred per
cent more to send a package by
mail to a foreign city than the citi
zen of either Germany or Mexico,
the large profits in the main going
into the hands of the express com
panies. Mr. Berwick is actively
interested in arousing public opin
ion on the subject, with the ulti
mate aim of forcing congressional
action to better the service in the
United States.
