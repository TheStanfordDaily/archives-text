spoke in the chapel last night on
the two plays that are to be pre

Professor Anderson spoke on
"Twelfth Night." His address was
mainly a view of the comedy,
touching particularly on the points
of interest from a literary and
dramatic view, and contrasting the
Shaksperian comedy as a whole
with the modern comedies.
"Twelfth Night" was written dur
the best period of Shakspere's
life, and in its intricate situations,
romantic settings and happy end
ing ranks with its contemporaries,
"As You Like It,""The Comedy of
Errors," "Much Ado About Noth
ing," and others, as one of the
most pleasing plays in literature.
The play is one of situation as
well as of feeling, and the art of
the writer shows to its best advan
tage in his handling of the char
acters in the delicate and romantic
as well as the funny scenes. Shak
spere was the best interpreter of
feminine thoughts and feelings that
the world has ever seen, and the
ideal loves imbued by him have
never been equalled in literature.
Mr. Putnam gave a summary of
the allegorical play, "Everyman,"
as he ww it produced in London
and at the University of California
by this same company. "Every
man" is the best representation we
