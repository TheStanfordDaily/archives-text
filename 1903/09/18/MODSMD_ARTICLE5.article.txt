# "EVERYMAN" MONDAY NIGHT.
## Stanford Will be Given an Opportunity to See Morality Play. 
### 
The company which has toured
England and the United States
under the management of Ben
Greet will play before a Stanford
audience for the first time Monday
night at 8 o'clock. The moral
ity play, "Everyman," which Mr.
Greet offers, is considered by both
literary and dramatic authorities
to present the highest type of the
ancient allegory. The different
motives and emotions that control
the course of a man's life are living
parts in the play and the struggle
that "Everyman," or every man,
makes against final judgment for
his evil deeds is the theme of the
play. The characters in the order
of their appearance are: Messenger,
Adonai, Dethe, Everyman, Fela
shyp, Cosin, Kynrede, Goodes,
Good-Dedes, Knolege, Confession,
Beaute, Strengthe, Five-Wyttes,
Discretion, Aungell, Doctor.
As far as possible the play will
be presented in the manner of the
Elizabethan era. The stage set
tings will be much less elaborate
than those used in the English
play. The actors, as individuals,
will be obliterated in their parts;
the costumes Â«nd the music will be
of the fifteenth century. The pre
sentation will be new in that the
action will l>e continuous, lasting
one hour and forty minutes.
The cast of Mr. Greet's company
will be entertained during their
stay at Stanford by different mem
bers of the English Club under
whose auspices the play will be
presented.
