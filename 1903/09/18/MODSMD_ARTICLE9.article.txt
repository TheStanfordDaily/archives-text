# STANFORD VS. RELIANCE.
## Line-up of Men Who Will Enter First Preliminary Varsity Game. 
### 
The first football game of the
season to be played with an out
side team will take place at 3:80
tomorrow afternoon on the campus
oval between the Varsity and the
Reliance Athletic Club team of
Oakland. This will be the first
heavy scrimmage work for the
Varsity men and the halves will be
short. From the strength of the
Reliance team the game is bound
to be a hard, fast fight from start
to finish. The rooting section will
be supported by the University
band, which will make its initial
appearance for the semester.
As will be seen from the line-up
given below, nearly all the Varsity
candidates will have an opportun
ity to get into the game. Manager
Smith of Reliance will bring
twenty-three men, all of whom
will probably be used during the
contest, in addition to the regular
Varsity candidates it is quite pos
sible that some of the heavier
Freshmen will be putin the game.
Following is the approximate
line-up of the players:
