## Ben Greet's Company to Present Shaksperian Play Tomorrow Night. 
### 
The second performance to be
given by lien Greet's company is
"Twelfth Night," which will be pre
sented in Assembly Hall tomorrow
night at 8:00 o'clock. It is ranked
as one of the classical "joyous com
edies," and owes its name to the
fact that it is supposed to have been
presented first in 1601, twelve
nights after Christmas. The first
recorded performance was in the
Middle Temple Hall in London,
February 2, IGOI, when Shak
spere is recorded to have taken the
part of Orsino. The Elizabethan
Stage Society has frequently pro
duced the play in the Middle Tem
ple, and Mr. Greet has endeavored
to present the play as though it
were given in the Middle Temple.
Part of the music of the play is tra
ditional. Oscar Weil,of San Fran
cisco, is the composer of the re
mainder. The cast of the charac
ters follows:
