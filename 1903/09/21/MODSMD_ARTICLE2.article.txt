## Chaplain Gardner Speaks Morning and Rev. Gallwey of Menlo in Afternoon. 
### 
The Sunday morning sermon in
Memorial Church was preached by
Chaplain Gardner upon the text:
"We Ray we do no sin; we deceive
ourselves; the truth is not in us."
Dr. Gardner spoke of two great
mysteries in life: that of personal
ity and the immortality of the soul,
and that of the consciousness of a
spiritual self and its relation to the
universe and to God. He dwelt
upon the great power of man's
temptations over him, and said in
part: "There are men who have no
acute sense of moral evil. Others
attempt to excuse this evil on the
basis of philosophy. The deepest
wants of human nature will not
be satisfied until men recognize
their sins and arise above them.
The will is the seat of sin, and ein
is the will directed to wrong ends.
Christianity offers the cure for sin.
Our natural characters may be
purified and ennobled through the
religion of Christ."
In the afternoon Rev. N. B. W.
Gallwey of Menlo Park preached
upon the texts, ( \So then with one
mind I serve God," and "As a man
thinketh in his heart, so is he."
Dr. Gallwey spoke upon the im
portance of right thinking and how
the thoughts influence character.
The man is finally stamped by his
thoughts. What we think in our
hearts we are before the sight of
God. It is worth our while to
train ourselves to think rightly.
Religion is not only being but also
thinking. W r e are the sculptors of
our character our thoughts.
