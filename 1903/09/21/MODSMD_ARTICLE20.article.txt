### 
The Inn Club held a meeting
Saturday evening. The special
committee, appointed at a previous
meeting to investigate the status
of the association, reported that
the members of the Inn Club will
be held only to the extent of $1000,
and all indebtedness in excess of
that figure will fall upon the direc
tors of the association. Chairman
Byrne announced that the com
mittee had been assured by Dr.
Jordan that the members of the
club would be held only to the
extent of their legal indebtedness.
According to the civil code of
the state of California relative to
co-operative business associations,
such as the Inn Club, it is provid
ed that the liability of an individ
ual member for the debts of the
association shall not exceed his pro
rata share of a total indebtedness
whose extent shall have been pro
vided for in the by-laws of the
association. The by-laws of the
Inn Club provide that the amount
of indebtedness of the Inn club
shall not exceed $1000. Legally,
therefore, Ihe members of the Club
now in college are liable only for
their proportion of $1000 of the
total debt.
It was further announced that
the circular letter sent out from
the President's office September
17th, requiring the club to raise
$1000 by the twenty-fourth of the
month, had been rescinded awaiting
the action of the Club.
The committee was contiued in
office with instructions to complete
arrangements for the sale of the
property, held by the club approx
imating in value $300. It was also
empowered to take action toward
levying an assessment as soon as
the total liabilities could be defi
nitely determined.
On a pro rata assessment for
$1000, each member of the Club
will be called on for $5.40. But
when the property of the Club is
disposed of, the indebtedness should
be reduced to about $700, making
each member liable for $3.79.
Another meeting of the Club
will be called as soon as the com
mittee has a further report. Atten
tion was called to the fact that the
by-laws of the association providing
that the Hoard of Directors should
make a monthly financial report,
and the steward should be required
to give a bond, had been entirely
disregarded.
