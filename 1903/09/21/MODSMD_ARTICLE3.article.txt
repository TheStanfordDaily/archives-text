# ASSEMBLY THIS MORNING.
## Ben Greet and Professor Newcomer Speak on Influence of Old English Plays. 
### 
Ben Greet, manager of the Ev
eryman Company, spoke at the
Assembly this morning on "The
Drama." Besides an historical
outline of the development of the
English drama, Mr. Greet empha
sized two points in regard to the
relation of the play-goer of the
present day to the modern drama.
In tracing the early history of
the drama he spoke of the relation
of art, music, literature, and the
drama to the character of a nation.
Before the 16th century the English
drama was so primitive as to be
nearly unintelligible. It was in as
chaotic a stage as was the civiliza
tion of the English people. But
with the introduction of printing a
new impetus was introduced. By
means of miracle and mystery
plays the Church kept alive the
drama until these earlier types
gave way to morality plays. With
the morality plays the primitive
stage of the drama was ended, for
the work of Shakspere followed
them in close succession. As the
greatest of all dramatists he stands
supreme today; his work has never
been equalled before or since.
That Mr. Greet has a mission to
fill in his reproduction of the old
plays was made clear in his con
cluding remarks. He laid down
two principles, and urged the ne
cessity of modern play-goers obey
ing them. The drama should not
be looked upon as a means of afford
ing amusement to spectators. Its
mission is to "hold a mirror up to
nature" that she may be seen as
she is. And in attempting to re
gard the drama in the proper way
the influence of women in support
ing strong, good plays instead of
bad and cheap ones cannot be over
estimated.
Professor Newcomer spoke from
a personal standpoint of the inter
est the work of the Elizabethan
Stage Society aroused. The pres
entation of Ben Jonson's "Alche
mist" in England possessed for
him an interest deeper than one
merely instructive. Credit, he said,
was due the Elizabethan Stage
Society for two things: that in
their handling of old plays they
have been appreciative of the sig
nificance and value of such produc
tions, and that they have remem
bered that they were essentially
plays and have done their best to
keep them interesting.
