# RESULTS IN TIE GAME.
## First Contest of Season Finds Varsity Players Weak in Team Work. 
### 
The Varsity played its first game
of the year Saturday with the Reli
ance Athletic Club. Neither team
was able to score. The game was
very satisfactory in the opinion of
the coaches and captain, consider
ing that it was the first contest of
the season. Head-Coach Lanagan
discussed the game as follows:
"The most gratifying feature of
the game was the absence of fum
bling by our men. While we can
not expect perfect team work at
this stage of practice, it was evi
denced by this game that the men
are a gritty set and have plenty of
fighting spirit." Assistant-Coach
Slaker and Captain Bansbach held
about the same opinion.
Probably the most noticeable
thing in the contest was the lack of
fumbling on the part of Varsity
players. As was anticipated, the
team work was ragged, and the men
were slow in getting into forma
tions. In the first half Stanford
had the better of the game and
kept the ball well within the terri
tory of their opponents. The sec
ond half, however,especially toward
the end, was clearly to the advan
tage of Reliance. Nearly every
man on the Varsity squad and
several of the Freshman candidates
were put into the game. The Reli
ance men were likewise frequently
changed.
The line-up of the teams was as
follows:

In the matter of weight the size
of the Reliance players hardly ad
mits of a comparison with the light
Stanford line. This contrast was
most evident at center, where Cava
naugh with a weight of two hun
dred and sixty pounds played
against Ilauverman at one hundred
and eighty. The Varsity, on the
other hand, had the advantage in
condition. Most of Stanford's gains
were made around the ends, while

Reliance found the vulnerable
points between tackles and guards.
Stanford won the kick-off, and
Sprott kicked to Geissler on Reli
ance twenty-yard line. Reliance
lost the ball on downs and Stan
ford carried it to the twentv-five
yard line, where Sprott tried for
field goal but missed. For the re
mainder of the half neither side
could come within striking distance
of the goals.
In the second half Reliance
kicked to Hauverman. Reliance
got the ball on her ten-yard line.
The rest of the second half was
taken up by a series of brilliant
cross-bucks and straight plunges in
which the heavy Reliance backs
made long gains through the Car
dinal line, and carried the ball
sixty yards toward the Stanford
goal.
Time was called with the ball in
possession of the Cardinal on her
own thirty-five yard line.
