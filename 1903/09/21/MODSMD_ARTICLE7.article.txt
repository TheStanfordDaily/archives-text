# NIGHT GYMNASIUM WORK.
## Dr. Storey Institutes Section for Students Who Cannot Qualify in Daytime. 
### 
An innovation in the gymna
sium work at Stanford is to be
started in the inauguration of a
night class for the accommodation
of the students who wish to take
this line of activity hut who have
no available hours for the present
classes. Any men registered for
day work may transfer to the night
class. The new class is also open
to men who are not registered for
any work, if they enroll at once.
Students who wish to take the ex
ercise without registering will be
allowed to do the class-work, pro
vided they are regular in their
attendance. The class work is to
begin as soon as the enroll
ment reaches thirty. The new
class has been started to ac
commodate those students who
cannot take gymnasium work at
any other period of the day and is
expected to fill a long-felt want.
