# UNIVERSITY INN CLOSES.
## Students' Eating Club Forced to Suspend Operations.â€”No Plans for Reopening. 
### 
The University Inn closed its
doors this evening. No arrange
ments have been made for its re
opening, but T. VV. Strowbridge,
the former manager, and Flint, the
chef, may submit a proposition to
the Hoard of Trustees at its Satur
day meeting to conduct tho eating
house. The Inn Club will dispose
of its property and terminate its
affairs as soon as possible. There
were only fifty regular boarders at
the time of the closing of the Inn.
