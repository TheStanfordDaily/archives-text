# THE
						CARNOT PRELIMINARIES.
## Intersociety Debating League Sets Date.â€”Takes Action on Other Matters. 
### 
Several matters of importance
were taken up by the executive
committee of the Intersociety De
bating League this afternoon.
November 20th was tixed upon as
the date for the preliminaries to
select this year's Carnot team, and
a committee composed of E. 0. Kit
ten house, '04, A. M. Dibble, '05,
and A. Sherriffs, '05, was appoint
ed to take the names of those who
will enter the preliminaries. The
committee expressed itself in favor
of holding the annual intercolleg
iate debates upon the campus of
each university in alternate years
instead of in San Francisco,as is the
custom. The opinion of the Univer
sity of California will be sought
and some action taken. O. C.
Spencer, '04, and P. D. Swing, '05,
were selected as a committee to
negotiate with the University of
Nevada and some southern Califor
nia colleges for a debate with the
second team.
The committee decided to take
into its own hands the setting of a
date for the Freshman-Sophomore
debate, and December 4th was ac
cordingly chosen. The managing
of the preliminaries will be left to
the class committees, but the judges
of the debate will probably be
selected by the executive commit
tee of the Debating League.
