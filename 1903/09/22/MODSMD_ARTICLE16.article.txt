The magazines in the Library
have recently been suffering from
careless and malicious mutilation
at the hands of some students.
Any book, especially one in a uni
versity library, should receive only
the most careful handling. A
magazine should be treated with
even greater care than an ordinary
book, for its subsequent value is
largely dependent upon its place in
a set, and a number destroyed can
frequently never be replaced.
Those who abuse the privileges
of the Library should remember
that books and periodicals were
placed there for careful use, and re
frain from doing any act to de
crease their value.
