In striking contrast with the
treatment that the bleachers accord
ed a certain visiting football team
two years ago was the careful re
fraining of the spectators at Satur
day's game from any public notice
of the disgraceful exhibition furn
ished by numerous loquacious
members of the Varsity's opponents.
The use of profanity on the football
field is to be always discounte
nanced, but doubly so when ladies
are present. In the line of progress
in the purity of athletics, the care
ful development of gentlemanly
conduct on the gridiron may be
sought. The Stanfordstudents are
to be commended for their strong
condemnation of the practice as
seen in their wise treatment of the
procedure. It is only another evi
dence of what good can be done by
the example of gentlemanly con
duct on the part of every student,
especially at the time of athletic
contests.
