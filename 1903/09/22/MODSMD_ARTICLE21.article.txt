# FRESHMAN GAME TOMORROW.
## Palo Alto Athletic Club Eleven Will be Opponents of 1907. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Fresh
man eleven will have an opportun
ity to try their strength against an
outside team. The eleven of the
Palo Alto Athletic Club, an organ
ization formed during the past
summer, will form the opposition
to the first-year men. A number
of the players are also members of
the Palo Alto high school team.
The second game of the week
will be called at 3:30 Saturday
afternoon between the Varsity and
an eleven representing the United
States Training Academy on Goat
Island, San Francisco Bay. This
team also goes under the name of
"Pensacola," taken from the cadet
training ship.
Arrangements are now under way
to have the Varsity team play
the Reliance Club on the Univer
sity of California campus two
weeks from Saturday, and to
schedule a game for the same day
on the Stanford campus between
California and the Naval Academy
eleven. This will give the parti
sans of Stanford and California
opportunity to judge of the respec
tive merits of the two teams before
the intercollegiate contest.
Tomorrow's game will be called
at four o'clock. The probable line
up of the teams follows :
