# PRODUCTION OF "EVERYMAN."
## Interesting Performance of the Morality Play in Assembly Hall. 
### 
The production of "Everyman"
last night was far from being a dis
appointment to those whose expec
tations had been raised by the
accounts of the morality play as
[tresented elsewhere. Whether
looked upon as a drama or a spec
tacle, enjoyed either from the his
toric or merely aesthetic standpoint,
the work of Mr. Greet's company
was an achievement of marked
brilliancy. Assembly Hall was
practically filled last evening.
The principal part,that of Every
man himself, is one of peculiar
difficulty, since it has nothing of
the grotesque or otherwise striking
in the "make-up," hut must be in
terpreted as a serious representa
tion of humanity. Moreover, it
requires almost constant work on
the part of the single actor from
the beginning to the end of the
play. So far as these difficulties
are concerned it was handled with
almost perfect taste, and with a
spontaneity which must be pecul
iarly difficult after so many per
formances. Some would prefer a
more restrained interpretation,
without suggestion of the melodra
matic at the points of chief inten
sity, but the fault here is due
simply to the undisguisedly femi
nine rendering of the part. That
being admitted, one should perhaps
wish nothing different. Mrs. Craw
lew's presentation of the gradual
change in the character of the hero
—one of the distinguishing marks
of skill of the unknown dramatist
—was more than skilful: it was
abidingly impressive.
The figure of Dethe was not only
extraordinary to the spectator, but
equally notable to the hearer. The
dignified severity of his manner,
and the suggestion of inexorable
though not malicious fate as con
veyed by the inflections of his voice,
formed an almost perfect represen
tation of the character. The voices
of all the actors (with the possible
exception of Knowlege, who some
times spoke in a rather indifferent
manner) were noticeably good.
That of Goodes deserves special
mention for the skill with which
his oily indifference and worldli
ness were brought out.
Hut while so much praise is due
the actors, the success of the revival
of this old play is after all due
chiefly to those who designed the
stage effects so imaginatively. Not
an opportunity is lost for bringing
out at the same time the media;val
spirit and the appeal to the sense
of beauty. The mere details, such
as the disappearance of the priest
Confession pulling his hood over
his head, the countermarching of
the monks who open the grave for
Everyman, the writing of his good
deeds in the book of reckoning, and
the magnificent apparition of the
flame-colored angel at the close, all
go to produce the impression de
sired. The climax of this visible
appeal is of course the procession
of Everyman and his companions,
the chief figure in the guise of a
pilgrim bearing his cross. The
scene in which the Lord appears to

summon humanity to judgment,
which has been omitted in many
places from fear of a misunder
standing as to its propriety and
reverence, was presented here in
full. To some it was no doubt a
matter of questionable taste to rep
resent the Deity in person; but no
one familiar with the customs of
the mediaeval church in this re
spect, or with the mediaeval paint
ings on which the scene was mod
eled, can have failed to see in it
the same reverent desire to present
spiritual things concretely which
the author of the drama and all
his contemporaries would have felt
and approved.
