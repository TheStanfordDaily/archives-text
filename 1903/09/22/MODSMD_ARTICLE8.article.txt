# Junior Girls Reconsider.
## 
### 
The Junior girls met today and
decided to reconsider their decision
to wear caps and gowns. The vote
was unanimous in favor of defer
ring to the objection of the Seniors.
The question of adopting as a
Junior hat a mortar-board of a dis
tinctive color was then discussed.
A red hat was finally chosen and a
committee consisting of Miss H. M.
Salisbury, Miss E. M. Reeves, and
Miss G. M. Stroud was appointed
to arrange for the procuring of the
headgear.
