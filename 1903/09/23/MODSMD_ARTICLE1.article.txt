# SUCCESSFUL PRESENTATION.
## Greet's Company Gives "Twelfth Night" to Big Audience in Assembly Hall. 
### 
The initial performance of
"Twelfth Night" by lien Greet's
company in this country was wit
nessed by a large and most appre
ciative audience lust night in As
sembly Hall. The play was given
without the omission of a single
line, and the idea of the old Eliza
bethan stage was followed perfectly.
There were no curtains to mark
the acts and scenes. A picturesque
feature was the stationing of the
orchestra, dressed in the costumes
of the Elizabethan era, in the bal
cony.
The actors all showed themselves
to be in perfect touch and sympa
thy with their roles. Constance
Crawley as Viola was wonderfully
real in depicting the page, who falls
in love with his master, Duke Or
sino, and who so cleverly repels
the passionate advances of Countess
Olivia. Viola showed herself full
of womanly tenderness and gentle
ness, with a spirit of fun pervading
all her actions. Ben Greet's pres
entation of Malvolio was beyond
comment, more than fulfilling all
expectations. As Malvolio, sati
ated with his own self-conceit, he
commanded, in spite of his ludi
crousness, respect and admiration
in the end. He is made the butt
of the clown's jokes whenever he
appears, turning Feste's witticisms
with the most perfect nonchalance.
The trick played on Malvolio with
the letter, and the dueling scene
between Viola and Sir Andrew,were
most amusing. Robert Smiley as
Sir Toby Belch carried the part of
the drunken reveler in a way that
left nothing to be desired. With
just a little less care this part could
have been overdone and would
have fallen into mere horse-play.
The comic and romantic situations
were wonderfully blended and well
handled.
Ben Greet came out at the close
in response to repeated encores.and
said among other things: "I want
to thank you heartily on behalf of
myself, my company, and Mr.
Frohman for the royal welcome ex
tended us, and I commend Stan
ford University in its endeavor to
foster the drama."
