Therk is no end of satisfaction
over the announcement that the
faculty committee on entertain
ments are arranging for a series of
four chamber concerts to he given
in Assembly Hall during the year.
Stanford has already become
marked for its enthusiastic recep
tion of choice musical attractions,
and those now proposed will suc
ceed in making the coming year a
particularly interesting one music
ally. There cannot be too many of
the desirable kind of plays and
concerts given on the campus, for
the Pacific Coast gets none too
many of the best theatrical attrac
tions anyway. The apparent
ready way in which the news of
the chamber concerts has been re
ceived must not mislead those who
are in charge of the subscription
lists, nor should it deter anyone
who is able from subscribing be
cause of the feeling that the project
will go through anyway. The
concerts will not be a certainty
until one thousand dollars can be
raised for the series. The under
taking is a big one, and everybody
who can possibly do so should help
the committee in every way. Sub
scribers will be allowed the fullest
freedom in the use of tickets, and
every concession will be made to
insure success.
