# RECEIPTS FROM PLAY.
## Band Debt Diminished by Nearly $300 as Result of Two Productions. 
### 
The two plays produced by Ben
Greet's company contributed very
materially to the treasury of the
Associated Students. The student
body received twenty percentofthe
gross receipts, which, after deduct
ing the cost of production, amount
ed to $294.45. This money was
turned over to the University Band
to pay off the debt on the instru
ments that were purchased last
year. There remained to be paid
only $140.40, of which the student
body treasurer has already paid
$100. There is still due on the
new instruments, therefore, $40.40.
