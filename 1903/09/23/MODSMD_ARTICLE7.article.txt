# FOUR CHAMBER CONCERTS.
## Faculty Committee on Entertainment Have Provided Four During Semester. 
### 
In addition to the musical at
tractions of a more general nature
for which the faculty committee
on entertainments has already per
fected arrangements, the committee
proposes to give a series of four
chamber-concerts to meet the aes
thetic and edcuational needs of
those specially interested in music.
Mr. C. Searles, of the Romanic
Languages department, has full
charge of the arrangements.
The committee has corresponded
with some of the best chamber-music
artists in San Francisco and in
that way is able to calculate the
cost of four first-class concerts of
this kind very closely. The com
mittee will take no chances on the
quality or the financial success of
the entertainments. Therefore it
has been decided that unless at
least one thousand dollars can be
raised for the series, the concerts
will not be given. A number of
subscription blanks will be distrib
uted and an opportunity given to
all who would like to attend con
certs of this kind to subscribe for
tickets. These concerts will be of
the highest character permitted by
the size of the subscription list, and
the programs will consist of musi
cal works composed for Btring trios,
quartettes or quintettes, and of
numbers by vocal soloists.
Subscription may be made for
one, two, three or four concerts at
the rate of $1.00 per concert or
$3.50 for the series. There will be
no restrictions as to transference
of tickets or choice of concerts.
All funds will be devoted to mak
ing these concerts the best possible.
It is the purpose of the committee
to furnish the highest-class music
at absolutely cost price. Three
hundred course tickets or their
equivalent in single tickets must be
subscribed for before the cammittee
can proceed. A list of those hav
ing subscription blanks will be
published as soon as possible.
