# "Chaparral" Appears Friday.
## 
### 
The Chaparral will appear Fri
day. There will be a full-page
supplement of a Stanford girl, the
work of B. C. Bubb, '04; also a full
page drawing by Borough, '04,
illustrating a light lyric by a new
Stanford writer. The rest of the
paper is made up of clever bits of
verse and prose, mostly by new
men trying for the board. The
work of the new men is especially
good. The new paper for the
Chaparral did not arrive from the
East in time for this issue.
