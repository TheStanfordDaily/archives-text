The Juniors are to meet tomor
row to consider the presentation of
a suitable plug-ugly. This annual
class affair is beginning to take its
place as one of the most important
functions of undergraduate activi
ties. There are several reasons
why it should be so regarded. In
the first place, as marking the
formal adoption of the plug, and
the entrance into upperclassdom, it
stamps the class as a unit. And
secondly, it is the first big event
that shows the entire college the
cohesiveness of the class. Under
classes are liable to be rambling
and incoherent in their organiza
tion. The dedication of the junior
hat wipes out this lack of unity in
the new upper class and brings it
into one great whole. The com
ment is often made that there is a
lack of class spirit and class feeling
at Stanford. If this is partly true,
it is due more than anything else to
the absence of big gatherings to
mutually acquaint all the mem
bers. The systems of majors and
electives make it hard for each class
to meet together on the basis of
similarity of studies. To offset
this handicap the coming ceremony
of inaugurating the class hat could
be made, with the display of a due
amount of energy, the greatest fac
tor in cementing class feeling
and enthusiasm. The past three
productions have followed each
other so closely that the present
class will do much to strengthen
the importance of this event by in
troducing an element of originality.
At the same time there will be
avoided the tendency of persons
to go merely for the spectacle of
the hat smashing. The weird and
fantastic element can be retained
without the sacrifice of originality,
and the interest of the entire col
lege kept up.
