# Tennis Court Subscriptions.
## 
### 
At last night's meeting of the
Executive Committeeof the student
body the matter of paying off the
debt on the new tennis court was
discussed, and also the advisability
of repairing the old courts in front
of the Encina gymnasium. There
is still $280 to he paid on the
new court. A sum sufficient to
cover the whole cost was subscribed
last semester but not collected, and
the subscribers have become so
scattered that the collection now
would be difficult. Consequently,
Treasurer Cowden is circulating
new subscription lists among the
students and hopes to raise a sub
stantial.sum.
The extent of the repairs to the
old courts will depend upon the
probable length of time that they
will be needed. It is not considered
advisable to spend any large
amounts upon repairs if the new
gymnasium is to be completed
within a couple of years, when a
location for permanent courts will
be available.
