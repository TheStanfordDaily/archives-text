# FRESHMEN DEFEATED.
## Palo Alto Athletic Club Scores Five Points in the First Half. 
### 
In their first game with an out
side team the Freshmen were de
feated yesterday by the Palo Alto
Club eleven. The only score made
during the game was a touchdown
by Palo Alto near the close of the
first half. The visiting team had
the advantage in weight, but con
sidering the small amount of prac
tice they have had, should not have
been too much for the Freshmen,
who did not begin to come up to
expectations in yesterday's game.
While some good work was done
by the backs and at right end the
line of the first-year players was
wofully weak.
Two different Freshman squads
were putin the game. Squad A
constituted the first team, and
squad B, which has been under the
coaching of McFadden, ex-'O4,
during the last ten days, went in
for the second half. Squad B
played the better ball of the two,
but was barely able to keep the
visitors from scoring. Although
such a poor showing was made by
the Freshmen, the allowance must
be made that several of their best
men were not in the game. Stott,
quarter; Dole, full-back; Chalmers,
half; and Weller, tackle, who are
four of the most valuable men in
the squad, did not enter the con
test.

In the first half the Freshmen
kicked off to Palo Alto's twenty
five-yard line. The backs of the
town team went through the Stan
ford tackles and guards for several
long gains, and were then held and
forced to punt. The Freshman
quarter and center fumbled three
consecutive times and lost the ball
on downs. Palo Alto started a
bucking game, and after twelve
minutes' playing had the ball over
the goal-line. Nearly all the gains
were made through guards and
tackles, which unquestionably are
the most vulnerable places in the
first-year line. Palo Alto missed
goal, and the score stood five to
nothing. The Freshmen could not
make their yards after receiving the
Palo Alto kick-off, and were forced

to punt. The half ended with the
ball in the middle of the field.
Palo Alto kicked off in the sec
ond half, and the Freshmen lost
the ball on a fumble. The ball
was then forced into Stanford ter

Stephenson, full-back, played the
best ball in the first half. Morrow
did the ablest work of the ends,
while Hayes at full-back, Wilhelm
at half-back, and Blood at tackle
all played in good form in the sec
ond half. The halves were fifteen
