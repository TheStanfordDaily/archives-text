# SUMMARY OF NEW STUDENTS.
## Registrar Issues Statement Concerning Preparation and Registration of Newcomers. 
### 
A bulletin from the Registrar's
oflice in regard to the students who
registered at Stanford for the first
time this year shows that the total
number is 437. The list of names
will be published in The Daily
Palo Alto next week. The num
ber of students coming from other
colleges and universities fell down,
as did the number of special stu
dents, while there were nearly fifty
more who entered from prepara
tory schools than last year.
The department strongest numer
ically is English this year as it
was last. The other large depart
ments, Law, Engineering, Chemis
try, German and Economics, nearly
maintained their proportion of new
students. The Philosophy depart
ment has practically gone out of
existence. The summaries by de
partments and place of preparation
follow:
