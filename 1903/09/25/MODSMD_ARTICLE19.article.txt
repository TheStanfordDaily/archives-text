Ampj.e evidence of the fact that
class spirit at Stanford lias descend
ed to a minimum has been given
by the two upper classes during
the present week. The Juniors
held an election of officers and
only fifty-two votes were cast by a
class which numbers over two hun
dred students in its ranks. This
afternoon the Senior class held a
meeting to nominate officers for
the ensuing semester and it was
found to be an impossibility to
keep in the room a quorum of only
twenty men. While no one can be
reproved for not being a politician,
everybody owes a duty to his class
that should make him see to it
that he is represented at all class
gatherings. Clas6 officers have
duties to perform which make their
positions not ones of empty honor,
but if the choice of officers rests in
the hands of twenty men gathered
together with the greatest of effort
and persuasion, the honor will be
a negative quality. Stanford has
no class rushes to bolster up her
class spirit, and other obstacles do
much to break down the class
barriers; but when so important
a matter as the election of officers
is in question, duty, if nothing
else, should make everybody attend.
As a nucleus for the interested
citizenship every college man is
supposed to display after he leaves
his institution, the shiftless indif
ference exhibited the past week
will commend itself to few. There
is very little excuse for evading
duty when the time devoted
amounts to about ten or fifteen
minutes.
