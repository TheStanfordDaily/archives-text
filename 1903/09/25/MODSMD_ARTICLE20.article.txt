The report of the Rand finances
was printed in Wednesday's issue
without mention of the very able
and commendable work done by
the English Club in the prepara
tion for the plays given by the
Greet Company. The club very
generously undertook charge of the
productions without any compen
sation to itself, and much credit is
due its members for the successful
outcome of the presentations.
