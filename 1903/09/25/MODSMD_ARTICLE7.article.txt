# WILL EXCHANGE GAMES.
## California Plays at Stanford and the Cardinal Goes to Berkeley-Campus. 
### 
Treasurer Cowden and Athletic-
Manager DeCoto of California held
a conference in San Francisco yes
terday and scheduled games by
which the California varsiiy will
play the Reliance Athletic Club
eleven on the Stanford campus
Saturday, October 10th, and the
Stanford Varsity will meet either
the Naval Training Academy or a
team from Fort Baker on the same
day on the campus of the Univer
sity of California. This plan of
interchanging preliminary games
is an innovation in the history of
intercollegiate football on the
Coa√üt. The idea will give the
student body of each university a
good opportunity to compare the
playing of the two big teams.
Another important matter was
decided by the University Ath
letic Managers yesterday. It was
agreed to hold the Freshman inter
collegiate contest on the Richmond
grounds in San Francisco instead
of on the Stanford campus as was
previously announced. There is
no intercollegiate agreement to the
effect that the Freshman games
should be played alternately on
the grounds of the universities.
The event took place last year on
the California campus for the
reason that there was then no
suitable gridiron in San Francisco.
The date of the contest remains
October 17th.
