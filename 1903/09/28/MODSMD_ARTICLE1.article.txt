# STANFORD DEFEATS SAILORS
## Marked Improvement Shown in Team Work of Cardinal Players. 
### 
The first Cardinal victory of the
year was wrested from the United
States Naval Training Academy
eleven Saturday afternoon by a
score of 17 to 0. All the points
"were made in the first half. The
main features brought out in the
game were the notable improve
ment in team work and speed of
the Varsity since the game with
Reliance a week ago, and the effect
iveness of the new quarter-back
play.
The Naval Academy team has
plenty of brawn and weight, but
its players are inexperienced and
consequently lacking in team work.
Stanford won the kick-off and
Sprott sent the ball to the ten-yard
line, from which it was run in to
the twenty-five-yard line. On the
first down the sailors fumbled and
on the next two failed to gain on
straight bucks. Stanford made
one yard through center, and then
Bansbach worked the quarter-back
play for a twenty-five-yard run
and touchdown. Sprott missed the
goal. Score sto 0. Sprott kicked
off and the ball was downed on the
twenty-yard line. The Doles and
Stillman took the ball down the
field on a series of straight plunges
and cross bucks through tackles
until within three yards of the
line. Wilfred Dole crossed the
goal line on a buck through left
tackle. Sprott kicked goal. Score
11 to 0.
The Academy kicked to W.Dole,
who was downed on the twenty
five-yard line. W. Dole bucked for
four yards and G. E. Dole fum
bled. Bansbach recovered the ball
and made five yards. W. Dole
went around right end for two
yards and Scholfield through cen
ter for one. The latter soon took
the ball for a forty-yard run to the
goal-posts. Sprott kicked the goal.
Score 17 to 0.
In the second half the ball was
kept in the sailors' territory a
great part of the time. Most of the
gains were made on- end runs by
the Tarpey brothers.
