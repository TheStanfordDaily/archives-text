### 
The Sunday morning sermon in
Memorial Church was preached by
the Rev. Charles R. Brown of the
First Congregational Church of
Oakland. Rev. Brown took as his
subject "The Kingliness of Christ."
He said that Christ's teaching
was not confined to certain things,
but that it concerned all things ;
that Christ's claim was over prop
erty, politics, teaching, worship,
and home. When Christ entered
Jerusalem and declared his king
ship there he was hut declaring his
right over man. Christ's teaching
was practical.
Master Warner Sherwood, a boy
soprano of Alameda, sang two solos
at the afternoon service, "I Know
That My Redeemer Liveth," and
"Thy Will Be Done."
