The ease with which the differ
ent classes are reconsidering actions
taken at previous meetings would
seem to imply that the first gath
erings are merely in the form of
preliminary processes to test the
feeling of the class as a whole.
Last week there was an instance
of a radical change of mind on the
part of the Junior women, and
today the Sophomore girls sur
rendered to careful deliberation and
decided to refuse the fez that the
class in a former meeting voted as
their insignia. All of which goes
to prove the contention that unless
the class meetings are better at
tended the measures voted will
never assume the stamp of unanim
ity. Generally there is ample
announcement given before the
meeting, and if little more thought
were exercised at the time when
the members are gathered together,
there would be less occasion for
what seems to be a customary
meeting of reconsideration a few
days later.
