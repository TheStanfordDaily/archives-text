# INN CLUB MEETING.
## Amount for Which Members Are Legally Responsible Decided Upon. 
### 
Another meeting of Inn Club
members was held on the quad
Saturday night. There was further
discussion of the debts of the club
and the legal responsibility of the
members who are still registered in
the University. L. D. Byrne, '05,
who presided over the meeting,
gave definite figures as to the num
ber of persons who are still, from
the legal point of view, active mem
bers, and as to the amount for
which each could be held responsi
ble. The books of the organization
show that the present membership
is 186, of which number a few more
than 100 are now in college. It
has been figured out as closely as
the confused condition of the books
will permit that the total debts
amount to $2,636.49. One item
has been satisfied by the attach
ment of the goods of the Inn Club,
reducing the total remaining in
debtedness to $2,401.63.
Taking into consideration, how
ever, that the legal indebtedness of
the club was limited by its consti
tution to $1000, it was decided that
the pro rata share of the debt
amounted to $5.35. If that sum
were paid by each member of the
club in college, the creditors would
receive about 41 cents on the dol
lar.
Byrne announced that he had
been requested to submit a written
report on the subject to President
Jordan. Until Dr. Jordan reaches
some decision as to what will be re
quired of the members, there will
probably be no new developments.
—Max Rosenfeld, ex-'95, has
been elected captain of the Olym
pic Club of »San Francisco.
