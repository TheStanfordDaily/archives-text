## University to Take No Action on Inn Assessments Until Receiver Appointed. 
### 
Because of the action of Roths
child Company of San Francisco
in attaching the property of the
Inn Club the University authori
ties have sent a circular letter to
the creditors advising them that no
effort will be made to collect assess
ments from members of the club
until a receiver is agreed upon by
the creditors. As matters now
stand, any sum of money collected
by assessment could be immediate
ly attached by any one of the cred
itors for the full amount of his
account. Until some action is
taken by agreement of the credi
tors, the faculty will suspend oper
ations and the circular letter of
September 17th is therefore waived.
Although the members of the Inn
Club are legally liable to the ex
tent of but $1000, it is not yet
known whether President Jordan
will decide that the interests of
equity will be satisfied by taking
advantage of what from the stand
point of the University authori
ties is regarded as a technicality.
