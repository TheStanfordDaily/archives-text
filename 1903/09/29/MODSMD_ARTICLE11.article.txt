# BELMONT VS. FRESHMEN.
## Preparatory School Eleven to Meet 1907 on Oval Tomorrow at Four. 
### 
The fast eleven from Belmont
preparatory school will give the
Freshmen one of the hardest pre
liminary contests of the season on
the campus oval tomorrow after
noon. The Belmont team is under
the coaching of W. T. Reid, Jr.,
head coach at Harvard in 1902.
and as usual is playing hall that
cannot he equaled by any other
preparatory school on the Coast.
The game between Belmont and
the 1906 Freshman p'ayers is still
fresh in the minds of those who
witnessed it, as among the best of
the preliminary contests. The
Freshmen are now playing in
fairly good form, and tomorrow's
game will be hard-earned by either
team that wins. The game will
begin at four o'clock.
Following is the line-up of the
teams:
FRESIIMEN BKLMONT
Morrow 1 e r Spahr
True 1 t r Ealand
Zimmerman . .1 g r Nowell
Phelps c Coe
Smith r g 1 Moody
Blood r t 1 Stow

Stagner q Noyes
Packard r h 1 Jackson
Laumeister.. .1 hr .Power

minute halves.
The next Varsity game is sched
uled for Saturday afternoon,
at which time the Reliance team,
strengthened by several new play
ers, will meet Stanford for a second
contest. The improvement in the
Varsity squad since its first strug
gle with Reliance will easily coun
terbalance the added strength of
the club team, so that the game
will be close and interesting. The
contest is called for 3:30.
Treasurer Cowden has had built
another gate to the football grounds
for the accommodation of the wo
men patrons of the game. The
new entrance is at the lower end
of the bleachers, so that its use will
allow the women to reach the set of
bleachers usually occupied by them
without being compelled to pass
the rooting section and the often
crowded old gateway.
The next game for the Freshmen,
after tomorrow's contest, will prob
ably be on Saturday against Santa
Clara College, if this game can be
definitely scheduled, it will be
played in Santa Clara.
A game has been scheduled for
the Varsity eleven on Wednesday
