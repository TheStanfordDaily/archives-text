# Trustees Meet.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Board of
Trustees held in San Francisco
Saturday the special committee on
registration reported and the board
took action on the cases of those
students who petitioned for the re
turn of registration fees on the
ground that they are California
residents. Decisions were reached
on each case individually, and let
ters have been written to the peti
tioners advising them of the results.
In some cases the fee was returned.
Beyond this the board transacted
only routine business.
