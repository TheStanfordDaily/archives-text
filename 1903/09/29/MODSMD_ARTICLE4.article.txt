# Basket-ball to Begin.
## 
### 
The students met last night and
reorganized the basket-ball club.
These men will do regular daily
work aside from their gymnasium
or track duties. The regular sea
eon has not begun, but it is the
intention of the committee to get
the sport well under way, so that
when hard work is begun next
semester there will be plenty of
good material from which to choose
a team. There is a possibility that
several games with outside teams
may be played this semester. The
men who signed up last night are
N. Col Iyer, '04, H. P. Bittner, '06,
J. F. Cahoon, '00, It. V. Meikle,
'06, J. A. Henderson, '07, J. B.
Holly, '06, P. W. Avery, '05, M. M.
Stearns, '06, and G. J. Presly, '07.
