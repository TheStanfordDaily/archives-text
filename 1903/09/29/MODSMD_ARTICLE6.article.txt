# THE 						CHAMBER CONCERTS.
## Subscription Lists Meeting with Favorable Response on Campus and in Palo Alto. 
### 
In view of the many questions
which have been asked in regard
to the nature of chamber music, it
may be said that the name was ap
plied as early as the fifteenth cen
tury to music composed for gather
ings of an informal or private
rather than general character. It
was the custom for kings and
princes to have acorpsof musicians
at the court, and this corps was des
ignated by the name musique de la
charnbre.
Chamber music as now composed
is part-music composed for violins,
cellos, piano, with occasionally a
horn or a reed instrument. The
number of parts varies from three
to occasionally eight. By part
music is meant, of course, that each
instrument has a special part of
its own, whereas in orchestras sev
eral instruments play the same
part.
In a general way, then, chamber
music bears the same relation to or
chestral music that vocal trios,
quartettes, etc., bear to a large cho
rus. The greater skill demanded
of the performers, each of whom
has a part of his own, as well as
the consequent opportunity given
of employing the full resources of
each instrument, make of chamber
music the most perfect expression
of the composer's genius and art.
Considerable interest has been
displayed in the efforts of the com
mittee to establish a series of con
certs of this kind. Subscription
blanks have been in circulation for
several daye. It is not certain yet
whether the necessary amount,
$1000, will be raised or not. The
blanks will be called in by Monday,
October sth. If the results permit
the committee to proceed, the first
concert will be given within two
weeks of that date.
