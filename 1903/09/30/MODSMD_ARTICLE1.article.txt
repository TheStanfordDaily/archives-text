## Committee Decides on the Terms for Prize Song Competition. 
### 
This afternoon the song com
mittee, composed of Miss Jeraldine
Brown, '04, H. P. Kuhn, '04, and
M. H. Thorpe, '05, met and decided
to close the competition for the
prize song Friday evening, October
9th, at 6<p.m. The songs handed to
the different members of the com
mittee are to have the noms de
plume attached, and the real name
in the envelope. The best ones
will then be opened. In this way
the committee will avoid any un
fairness in the selection of the best
song. The authors of the best will
be notified to call the Saturday fol
lowing for the personal rendition
of their songs and music. As soon
as the committee chooses the song,
it will select the best old songs and
the new ones of honorable mention,
and will publish them in the regu
lar song-book, which is to be en
tirely different from previous ones
in that the yells will be eliminated.
Publication will follow as soon
as possible after the competition
closes. The cover and general ap
pearance of the book will undergo
a complete change. It is to be nar
row, about half the width of last
year's, but a little longer.
