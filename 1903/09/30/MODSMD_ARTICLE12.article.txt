# Gmynasium Notes.

### 
The work of the gymnasium
classes has been considerably en
larged and extended this semester.
From each class five sections are
sent out on the diamond to play
baseball for the full class period.
Several sections substitute basket
ball for the regular apparatus work,
and the handball courts are al
ways occupied. W. F. Dunn, '04,
holder of the championship hand
ball belt, is acting as instructor to
the new men.
Wrestling and boxing, which last
year were only open to men who
had taken gymnasium work for
several semesters, are now on the
assigned list of apparatus work.
The management has been com
pelled to discontinue fencing and
broadswording because of the luck
of an instructor. F. E. Millar,'o6,
and G. Cromwell, '04, are serving
as voluntary gymnasium assistants.
