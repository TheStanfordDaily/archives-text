While the prize songs of the past
few years have fulfilled their pur
pose, have been sung at the inter
collegiate football game, and then
have died, the time has come when
the need for a different and better
kind of song is painfully apparent.
The fact that a prize song has
been written every year has not
been completely satisfactory.
These have been j, devoted exclu
bively to football and are bo techni
cally and completely of the gridiron
in their make-up as to preclude
the possibility of their being sung
on any occasion other than a foot
ball game. They have been too
limited in their field and, conse
quently, too temporary in their
life. Stanford needs a song of the
same nature as the "Boola" song of
Yale. She has a hymn that is
dignified and impressive, and the
"Stanford Red" is so difficult as to
be almost impossible to sing. There
is need for something simple and
snappy, with a good swing and a
big element of Stanford spirit be
hind it. This is the song that the
present competition should call out,
and to that end the contest will re
main open until October 9th. Let
every Stanford writer try to do
something good in the meantime.
Let Stanford have a song that will
be as good ten years from now as
it is today. Let her have a song
that can be sung at a football
game, a baseball contest, a track
meet, a debate, at her own rallies, —
any place where there are Stanford
men and Stanford spirit.
