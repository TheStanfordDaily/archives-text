# CALIFORNIA PROGRESS.
## Strong: Line and Weak Backs Against a Light and Inexperienced Team. 
### 
While the coaches at Stanford
are trying to develop speed and
team work among a Bquad of inex
perienced and light players, Whip
ple at California js confronted with
a different problem. Practice and
preliminary games at the State
University during this season have
shown two things: that California
has a fast, heavy line which is
almost impenetrable, and that her
backs are second-class men. In
the game with Reliance last Satur
day the club men made their
distance on bucks twice, the Cali
fornia line holding the Reliance
team for downs with seeming ease.
But with heavy linemen to open
up holes, the Berkeley backs were
unable to carry the ball to a touch
down. The practice work that is
confronting California at the pres
ent time is to train her halves so
that they can be relied on to carry
the ball forward. The fact that
she is weak in this respect is a
very encouraging thing for Stan
ford. A glance at the personnel
of the two elevens leaves every
thing to California's favor. She
has a veteran line, a heavyweight,
and More and Mini, quarter-back
and half-back on last year's varsity,
have appeared for practice again.
Overall is punting well this season
and will probably out-kick any
opponent who may present him
self. Appearances are then that
California will have a team which
it will be almost impossible to de
feat but which will in all probabil
ity not score rapidly.
A comparison with the condition
at Stanford at present is not en
couraging for the Cardinal. The
Varsity team is light, there are
several holes to be filled by new
men, and no one has shown upas a
strong and consistent punter. The
problem which confronts the Stan
ford coaches is to develop a speedy
though light team that in open
work can sift through California's
guards, and on the other hand devel
op a line sufficiently strong to with
hold the attacks of the weak Berke
ley backs. The season has not
been long enough to decide as to
the success the respective coaches
will attain. At the end of two
weeks comparative scores will en
able a closer line to be drawn on
the standing of the two elevens.
