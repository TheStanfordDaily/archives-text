# Guild Starts Innovation.

### 
The Students' Guild is about to
enlarge its field by the addition of
a district nurse to the hospital
staff. This district nurse will be
provided with a sick-room equip
ment so as to be ready to
attend the call of sick per
sons at their homes. Those
to be attended will not necessarily
be students, but any person in this
vicinity who needs the services of a
nurse.
The association will pay this
nurse a certain fixed salary, and
those attended will be charged a
certain sum per hour. The venture
is in the nature of an experiment,
and depends upon the support
given to the Guild. The nurse will
commence her duties about October
Ist.
Five persons are now employed
by the Guild—three nurses, a
housekeeper, and a janitor. Three
patients are in the hospital at
present.
