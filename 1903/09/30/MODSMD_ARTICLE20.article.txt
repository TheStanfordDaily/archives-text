# COLLECTS RARE SPECIMENS.
## A 						Former Stanford Student Investigates Fishes and Birds in Pacific Islands. 
### 
The Daily Telegraph of Sydney,
Australia, in its issue of August
25th, has the following about an
old Stanford man, Alvin Seale,
ex-'9B, who was a special in the
Zoologj' department:
Mr. Alvin Seale, an American
scientist, who has spent two years
in scientific research in the Pacific
islands, arrived in Sydney last
evening by the steamer Ovalau.
Speaking to a representative of
this journal shortly after his ar
rival, he said: "Altogether 1 have
spent about a couple of years in
different parts of the Pacific, fully
twelve months of which were taken
up with research in the Marquesas,
Paumotu, and Society Islands. I
also went across to the New Hebrides
and made a study of their fauna
and flora, finding a great many
features in these islands interesting
to science. Afterwards I visited
the Solomon group, where my work
was confined chiefly to the western
end of the islands—that part which
is the nearest to the German terri
tory. I made a careful study of
the birds and fishes with excellent
results, and succeeded in discover
ing several entirely new species of
birds and fishes. I also gathered
many ethnological specimens, one
of which, a magnificent war canoe
45 feet long, was much admired
coming over on the steamer. The
canoe iB built to hold twenty war
riors, and it formerly belonged to
the king of the island of Alu,
whose pricipal gods are carved all
over it. A remarkable thing about
this class of canoe iB the staunch
ness of the build. I have been in
some very rough seas with it, but
there never was any danger. Al
though it is all sewn together —
not a single nail or screw being
used —the hardwood of which it is
composed makes it strong and dur
able, and there is absolutely no
leakage.
"The most important notes of
my visit will be reserved for the
Bishop Museum of Honolulu, a
very wealthily endowed institution.
I intend to see a bit of Australia
and then go back to the United
States by the Ventura."
