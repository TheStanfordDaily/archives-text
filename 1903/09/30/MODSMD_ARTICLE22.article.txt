The Chaparral has on hand a
considerable amount of copy which
it is unable to use for the reason
that the contributors failed to en
close their names with their con
tributions. It is an invariable rule
of the paper never to use manu
scripts from authors whose identity
is not known to the editor. Where
contributors do not desire their
contributions to be signed, a state
ment to this effect will be sufficient,
but the editor must know who is
responsible for submitted manu
scripts. Authors of unsigned ma
terial now on hand will confer a
favor on the editor by making
their identity known.
Editor Chaparral.
