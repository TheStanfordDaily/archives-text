# NO TRAINING-TABLE YET.
## Arrangements Not Completed to Provide Accommodations for Football Men. 
### 
The matter of a training-table
for the football squad is giving the
athletic management some consider
able trouble. Last year the table
at the Inn was started on October
Ist, but this season no arrange
ments are as yet made for taking
care of the players on the campus.
All the boarding-hou√ües are full,
and none of the fraternity houses
have sufficient accommodations for
an additional twenty men. The
only plan that is open at present
is to take the men to Palo Alto or
to start a club on College Terrace.
Treasurer Cowden is arranging
to have the track around the east
end of the oval putin shape for
fall training. Every year the rainy
season has made the track so soft
that the distance men could not
develop speed. It is intended to
tear up half the track on the east
end and putin a new grade, which
will be given a heavy coat of cin
ders. The run-ways for the jumps
will also be putin condition within
the next few days.
