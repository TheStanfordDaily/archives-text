# BELMONT DEFEATS FRESHMEN
## Team Work of Preparatory School Takes Contest from First-Year Men. 
### 
In accordance with expectation,
the Freshman team met its second
defeat yesterday at the hands of
the Belmont preparatory school
eleven by the score 6 to 0.
From start to finish the Bel
mont players showed superior
team work and smoothly executed
formations. The interference of
the visitors on end plays was ad
mirably formed. The Freshman
line, though considerably stronger
than in the game with the Palo
Alto Athletic Club, was ineffectual
against the living plunges of the
Belmont backs. Belmont first tried
both ends and line, but soon cen
tered on right tackle, where Stowe
made good holes for Power, Bishop
and Jackson, the Belmont backs,
to follow for long gains.
Yesterday Dole and Stott were
not putin the game at all, and
Weller went in only at the close of
the second half. Until a contest
is played in which appear all the
best players the class has pro
duced, the actual strength of the
first-year eleven can not be known.
There remains, however, the obvious
fact that in any event there will be
weak places in the line. Weller at
right tackle, and Morrow on right
end, will make the side of the line
hard to penetrate, but on the left of
center there is very little weight or
football instinct.

Jackson of Belmont kicked off to
Stephenson, who ran in five yards.
The Freshmen made no gain on
two downs and were forced to punt.
Belmont began advancing the ball
by trying a series of end runs and
line bucks. Their most effective
work was through right tackle. A
series of line bucks brought the
ball to Stanford's twenty-yard
line, from where Power carried it
to within a few feet of the goal-line.
Jackson then bucked right guard
for a touchdown, which Moody
followed up by kicking an accurate
goal from near the edge of the field.
Stanford kicked to Spahr, who was
downed in a difficult tackle by
Morrow. Belmont twice tried right
end for a loss, and time was called
on the first half.
The feature of the second half
was a sixty-yard run by Noyes,
captain and quarter-back on the
Belmont eleven. This was the
most spectacular play that has
occured on the held this year. The
Belmont interference was perfect
and piloted the runner by the

whole Freshman team until he
was tackled by Packard on the
twenty-yard line. Jackson failed
on a place kick. The game ended
with the ball in the possession of
the Freshmen on the twenty-five
yard line.
