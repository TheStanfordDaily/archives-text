Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It is not yet certain whether the
chamber music concerts can be
given. But as there seems to be
some misunderstanding on the part
of the public as to the purposes
and conditions which govern the
committee, a few more words are
not out of place. The faculty com
mittee on entertainment — Professors
Young, Marx, Campbell, Miller and
Searles—hoped to accomplish three
things this year: to give a series
of concerts by musical organiza
tions of national reputation, to buy
a concert grand piano which is
plainly necessary, and to give a
series of chamber concerts.
The cost of bringing these well
known musical organizations to the
campus is so great that with our
limited public there can be but
little profit from the concerts. In
buying the piano the committee
must undertake a heavy liability.
Under these circumstances it did
not feel that it could run the risk
of losing anything on a course of
chamber concerts which are expen
sive and do not appeal to the com
munity at large. It felt willing to
to do the work if it could be as
sured of not increasing its financial
liabilities thereby. Inquiries were
made as to the cost of concerts by
the Minetti and Koota Chamber
Quartets, which doubtless do the
best work of this kind on the
Coast. It was found that it would
take at least one thousand dollars
to give four concerts (with a soloist)
of this kind, two each semester.
It was thought best not to engage
these musicians, however, to give
all the concerts, as there seemed to
be some chance that some of th«
great quartets and quintets of the
Fast might come out in the course
of the winter and so give us a
chance of varying the program.
It ie hoped that this statement will
answer one of the chief objections
which those interested have en
countered.
The committee remembers that
last year two excellent concerts of
this kind caused a loss of between
$150 and $200,and feels no courage
to try again unless support is as
sured. It is of course impossible
for the committee to inform those
who would like to subscribe, what
night of the week each concert will
be given or to give the name and
pedigree of each performer who
will take part. The proposition is
this: If there are three hundred
people who are interested in cham
ber music to the extent of $3.50,
cost of season tickets, the commit
tee will give them the best the
money can procure. It may be
noted in passing that this rale of
$3.50 for season and $1.00 for
single tickets is considerably cheap
er than the usual rate in cities for
concerts of an equal quality. If
there is insufficient interest to
insure success, the effort will be
given up. C. Searles.
