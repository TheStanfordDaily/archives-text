# Executive Committee Meets.
## 
### 
There was no business of an}' im
portance before the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students
at its meeting last night. There
was some discussion of the song
books, but no definite arrangements
for these were completed. It is
proposed to get them ready as soon
as possible, and to dispose of them
at as low a price as possible, so
that every one may have a copy.
