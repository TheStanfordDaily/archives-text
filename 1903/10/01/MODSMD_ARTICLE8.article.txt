# Eastern Football Prospects.

### 
The football season of 1903 is
well under way among the Eastern
colleges. Yale, Harvard, Prince
ton, Pennsylvania, Cornell, and
the smaller colleges have each
played two preliminary games, and
are working toward the develop
ment of teams for their big con
tests. Yale is conceded to have
the best chance of carrying off first
honors this year. Captain Raffer
ty, at end, has a good nucleus of
last year's team around which to
build the varsity. While there are
three vacancies in the line, some
strong material is available. The
graduate coaches who will be at
New Haven during the season in
clude over twenty names of ex
captains and old players on victo
rious Yale elevens. Yale's games
with West Point, Columbia, and
Princeton will furnish the hardest
work before the big struggle with
Princeton.
At Cambridge the situation is
very similar to that existing in
1901. Harvard met a disastrous
defeat last season, but with seven
old men back and three of last
year's substitutes in addition to a
squad which numbers well over
one hundred men, Captain Mar
shall has a strong possibility of
building up a winning team.
About fifty candidates are going
through daily work at Princeton
under Head-Coach Hillehrand. At
Pennsylvania the season is already
old. Two weeks of light prelimi
nary work was carried on at Reach
Haven, so that the old men were in
good condition when work began
on Franklin Field.
