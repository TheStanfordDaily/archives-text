# VARSITY VS. RELIANCE.
## Light Stanford Team Will Meet Heavy Clubmen Again on Oval. 
### 
With a record of two 0-0 games
against Stanford and California,
the Reliance team will play its
third game of the season against
the Varsity at 3:30 tomorrow on
the oval. Their game with Cali
fornia last Saturday showed that
while they were not able to buck
the Blue and Gold line, they were
quite able to prevent California
from scoring. Whether or not the
practice of the past week has placed
the Varsity in a position to defeat
her rivals is very uncertain. There
has been decided improvement in
team work, but the men are still
slow and the line is very light.
The halves will be twenty minutes
and the game is to be called at
3:30. In all probability a number
of men will be given a chance
against Reliance in the second
half. The teams will face each
other for the first half in the fol
lowing order:
