The University dances are to be
restricted this year to four. These
include two class dances and two
under the direction of Encina Club.
It is further announced that only
two will be allowed in the men's
dormitory and none at all off the
campus. It is not known what the
exact reasons are for strengthening
the innovation begun last year, but
if the idea is to narrow the social
life of the University undoubtedly
it will have that effect. The sources
of the apprehension that the social
activity at Stanford has reached
undue proportions do not appear
very clearly. However, this phase
of the matter is of minor import
ance, notwithstanding the harmful
effect upon class spirit and uni
versity life in general that the
omission of the annual class
dances will produce. In other
years the two under classes
have been enabled to pay off their
indebtedness with the proceeds of
their annual dances. Last year
found the Freshmen with no mon
ey to pay for the sweaters awarded
to the members of their football
team, and an assessment was neces
sary to wipe out the debt. The
University Band is at much ex
pense in keeping up its organiza
tion throughout the year. Last
semester it raised . considerable
money by dances to pay a portion
on the cost of its new instruments,
and it was the intention to
try the same means this year.
What measures it will adopt in
view of the new orders do not now
suggest themselves. There are any
number of reasons why these class
and other University dances should
not be discouraged. All do their
part toward promoting good feel
ing among the students by widen
ing their acquaintanceship. Any
thing that tends to make the culti
vation of college friendship more
difficult must be deplored. It has
been well said that the acquaint

ances one makes during his college
course constitute one-half of the
value received from a university
training. Is the present order one
to add weight to that statement?
