# REVIEW OF THE WEEK
## Varsity Steadily Improving, but Freshmen Lack Brawn and Team Work. 
### 
The development that has taken
place on the oval during the past
week has been slow and steady.
The Varsity candidates have been
put through light signal work
nightly, with an occasional short
line-up against the Second team.
There have been many shifts among
the Varsity men, and an attempt to
pick a final line-up at this time
would bean impossibility. Weller,
who has been trying for tackle, was
taken out of the line and putin at
full on tlie Second team Wednes
day. He is so entirely lacking in
football experience that he will be
an uncertain quantity for a week
or two more. He has weight, is
fast on his feet, and has plenty of
nerve, but bucks too high, is inex
perienced in backing up the line,
and green in making formations.
His natural advantages are so
great that a period of hard coach
ing may make him develop into a
smashing full-back. Of the half
backs, the Dole brothers, the two
Tarpeys and Freshman Chalmers
are all showing up in good shape.
Wilfred Dole is playing unusually
good ball this year and seems a
certain quantity, while the fight
for the other half will be close,
it is in the line that the fight will
be hardest to forecast. Hauver
man, Thompson and Sprott are
apparently fixtures, and Clark will
probably play one end; but no one
has putin a particularly strong
bid for the three places on the other
side of the center. At end, Butter
field, who is strong on defense, is op
posed to Preston, sub on the 1901
Varsity, and Wilbur, end on the
1905 freshman team. Rutterfield
is probably the best of the three on
defensive work, while Preston and
Wilbur are pressing him close in
the other branches of the game.
Shields and Stillman are putting
up a close struggle for tackles' po
sition. Stillman has better knowl
edge of the fine points of the game,
but lacks the weight and aggressive
ness that make Shields a very
formidable man. At guard, Fred
rickson, Hyde, Jacobs and Mon
zingoare all possibilities. No one
of the quartet seems able to fill
the position and no one has gained
a marked advantage in the race.
The team as a whole has made
favorable progress. The forma
tions are more quickly made, the
backs support the line men more
consistently, and the forwards are
more aggressive. There is still
room for improvement in the kick
ing department, in the defensive
play of the linemen, and in general
team work when the team is ad
vancing the ball.
The Freshman squad is as uncer
tain a quantity as it was a week
ago. The team work is ragged, the
backs are erratic in carrying the
ball, and in the Belmont game the
weakness of the line was thoroughly
demonstrated. In addition to the
loss of Crutcher at end, King at
quarter, Chalmers at half, Blood,
who was trying for tackle, has been
obliged to leave the game because
of injuries.
