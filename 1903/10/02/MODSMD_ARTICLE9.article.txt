# Class Dances Limited.
## 
### 
The University authorities have
'decreed that there will he but four
University dances this year, two
to take place in Encina gymna
sium and two in Encina Hall. The
latter will probably be the dances
of Encina Club, but this has not
been definitely decided upon. The
members of the club will consult
with Dr. Jordan, and if they prefer
to give only one of their dances in
the Hall, then the Senior Rail will
take place there. Otherwise the
Senior Ball and Junior Prom will
be given in Encina gymnasium.
In case the club decided to give
both their dances in the gymna
sium, both class dances can be
held in Encina. The Freshman
Glee and Sophomore Cotillion will
not be given, as the dances are
limited to four on the campus and
no University dances will be al
lowed off the campus. The girls in
Roble Hall will be given the privi
lege of holding dances in their
gymnasium.
