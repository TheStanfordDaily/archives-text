# VARSITY DEFEATS RELIANCE.
## Defensive Work of Cardinal Eleven the Most Encouraging Feature of Contest. 
### 
Saturday's game was easily the
best exhibition of football that lias
been seen on tbe campus tbe sea
son. Unfortunate fumbles at criti
cal times were the only cause of
Stanford's failure to score in the
first half. The only score was
made early in the second half, when
Bansbach made a brilliant forty
yard run for a touchdown on the
new quarter-back play. Sprott fol
lowed with an accurate goal and
made tbe score six to nothing.

So strong was the Varsity on
defensive work that only twice dur
ing tbe entire game did Reliance
make its yards. During the whole
of the second half Reliance carried
the ball forward but two yards.
Not only was the Cardinal line
impregnable, but time after time
the ends and tackles broke through
and downed the Reliance runner be
hind the line for a considerable loss.
The work of Weller, who went in
as full-back toward the close of the
game, was surprising to those who
had not been out to the last two
evenings of practice. The holes
that he made in the club team's
line were good for a series of long
gains. The offensive work of Sprott
at tackle was excellent.
In the first half Sprott kicked off
to Holt, who ran in fifteen yards to
the thirty-yard line, where he was
downed by Bansbach. Mueller tried
right end for no gain, and on the
next down the ball was fumbled
but recovered by Reliance. Muel
ler punted ten yards. Stanford
made its yards on three cross-bucks
and W. Dole punted thirty yards.
Reliance failed to gain around
right end, and Mueller punted
twenty-five yards. Stanford with
a series of tackles-back and short
end runs brought the ball within
close distance of the goal line, when
W. Dole fumbled to Reliance.
Mueller punted out of danger.
Tbe features of the second half
were the quarter-back run by Bans
bach and an open field run by W.
Dole, who carried the ball behind
perfect interference for forty yards.
Toward the close of the half McDon

ougb, left tackle on Reliance, broke
both bones in bis leg below the
knee in a particularly tierce scrim
mage. In the name rush Smith,
who played end on the Varsity,
was laid out with a blow on tbe
head. McDonough was then taken
to the Guild Hospital for medical
attendance.
