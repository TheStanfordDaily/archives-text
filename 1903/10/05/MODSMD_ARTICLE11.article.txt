# THE 						SUNDAY SERMON.
## Chaplain Gardner Preaches on the Need and Value of Prayer. 
### 
The eerinon Sunday morning was
preached by Chaplain Gardner. He
took as his text 1 Corinthians, 10:31:
''Whether therefore ye eat or drink
or whatsoever ye do, do all to the
glory of God."
These words, the preacher said,
formed the key to a life of complete
devotion to the Christian ideal.
Religion does not deal principally
with the mysterious and unseen; it
has to do with common life. It is
to the life of the spirit what sun
shine is to nature: it is light and
life. The value of religion lies in
its motive to pure and honest liv
ing. Its hest expression is con
duct. Its finest product is net or
thodoxy, hut character.
In dealing with the text the
preacher emphasized the need of
prayer as a power to help us to live
a Godly, righteous and a sober life.
He quoted the saying of Dr. Light
foot that a certain learned man got
more knowledge by his prayer than
by all his studies. The preacher
granted that some would prefer
conduct rather than prayer as a
test of practical religion.
