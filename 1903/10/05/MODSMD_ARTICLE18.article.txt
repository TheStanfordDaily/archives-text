Two weeks have passed since the
closing of the Inn, and no arrange
ments are heard of to take care of
the students on the campus. It is
quite generally understood that
several propositions to run the
eating-house were made, but no
negotiations have been closed. Al
ready an exodus from Encina has
started to Palo Alto, and, unless
something is done soon, by the ap
proaching rainy season about forty
will have left the hall. The miss
ing of meals and the rush to indis
criminate restaurants, with the
necessary hasty eating and racing
back to the campus, will be evi
denced soon in weak and impaired
digestions and a radical change in
the general physical condition of
the students. There is good cause
for apprehension in the present
difficulty, for there is every possible
reason why the health of the stu
dents should not be risked at this
time. What is going to be done?
The students look at the present
deficit and naturally are a little
wary of another experience. From
the trustees comes no announce
ment that the University is going
to step in and solve the difficulty.
The building stands empty, and
we have the anomalous and highly
distressing situation of a great
University without an eating-place
for a large body of its men students.
It is high time that something be
done, and there may be stated the
fact that nobody—students, Uni
versity, or professional caterers —
will ever make the Inn a success
until every student that is accus
tomed to eat at campus boarding
houses patronize it; until every
one who does eat there make it a
matter of personal honor to be reg
ular in his attendance; until the
best possible men are placed at the
head of the management; and
lastly, until the prohibitive rent is
waived by the University authori
ties.
