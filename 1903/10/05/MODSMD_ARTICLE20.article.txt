# DESIRES MORE DEBATES.
## University of Washington Seeks Another Intercollegiate Agreement with Stanford. 
### 
A letter has been received by the
executive committee of the lnter
society Debating League from J. R.
Slattery, secretary of the committee
on debating and oratory at the
University of Washington, asking
for a renewal of the intercollegiate
debating relations between the uni
versities. The terms which Wash
ington offers are the same as those
which governed the agreement that
expired last year, with the excep
tion that there shall be three de
bates instead of two. The Stanford
committee has not yet acted upon
the communication.
The contest in 1901, which was
held at Stanford, resulted in a tie.
Last year's debate with the Stan
ford second team went to the Uni
versity of Washington.
