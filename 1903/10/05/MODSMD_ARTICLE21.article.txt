## 
### 
A letter of thanks to William 11.
Hearst, for offering a second silver
cup to the university first winning
three out of five debates in the an
nual Stanford-California intercol
legiate contests, has been signed by
Max Thelen, '04, of the University
of California, and Frank ltoehr,
'04, of Stanford, and forwarded to
the donor of the trophy. The tro
phy is a beautifully engraved, solid
silver cup. It will arrive at Stan
ford in a few days. Last year's vic
tory for the Cardinal entitles Stan
ford to hold the cup for the
present year. When either of the
universities has won three debates
it keeps the cup permanently.
