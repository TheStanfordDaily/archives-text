# Arranging for Girls' Tennis.
## 
### 
The Roble gymnasium tennis
squad met Friday afternoon to
discuss the prospects of tennis for
the year. The challenge of the
California women for a contest was
discussed, but no definite decision
was reached as to its acceptance.
The question of the best method to
be used in selecting additional
members of the squad from this
year's new material was considered.
With this end in view a tourna
ment is to be arranged for Satur
day next in which only candidates
for the squad will take part. The
squad at present is composed of
Miss Minnie Mirsky, '04, Miss Mary
Foster, '04, Miss Mabel Ray, '05,
Miss Charlotte Paine, '0(5, Miss
Georgia Pitman, '05, Miss Esther
Crandall, '03, and Miss Dorothy
Abbott, '06.
