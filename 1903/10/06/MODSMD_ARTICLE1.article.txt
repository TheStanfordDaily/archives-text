# MRS. STANFORD'S GIFT.
## New Library Will Be Started in January as Donation of Founder. 
### 
Ground will be broken on the
campus in January for the magni
icent new Library building. The
present plan is to have Treasurer
Lathrop turn the first shovel of
dirt on New Year's day, and as
soon as possible after that a formal
dedication will take place at the
laying of the cornerstone, which
will undoubtedly occur in March.
The entire cost of constructing
the new Library, which it has been
estimated will cost over half a
million dollars, will be defrayed
from the private purse of Mrs.
Stanford, who is now in Australia
conferring with Thomas Welton
Stanford as to various features of
the building. The money will come
as an unconditional gift to the Uni
versity. It has been reported that
a large sum may be given as a
permanent endowment for the
Library.
When Mrs. Stanford became
president of the Board of Trustees
Bhe made an address to the board
in which she expressed a wish to
build a new library. No reference
was made to a gift of money for
the purpose, nor was anything Baid
of an endowment. Just before she
left some weeks ago for a trip
around the world, however, Mrs.
Stanford stated to some friends
that such a gift would probably be
made, and that the University's
present endowment would not be
used for the cost of the building.
The present Library building was
completed in January, 1900. It
now contains nearly 90,000 vol
umes. Although it is compara
tively new it is almost outgrown,
and within a short number of years
will be entirely inadequate. The
quarters of the Law library, in the
inner quadrangle,are also cramped,
and the present Library building
will be used by this department
when the new structure is finished.
The new Library will be to the
right of the northern, or front, fa
cade of the outer quadrangle, fac
ing the Chemistry building on the
other side of the quadrangle and
adjoining the Gymnasium building
that is now in course of construc
tion. The completed plans were
sent to Australia for Mrs. Stan
ford's inspection and will be re
turned in about a month. In a
general way it may be stated that
the building will be three stories in
height, and will have a deep and
spacious basement. The front will
be nearly three hundred and fifty
feet long. It will be constructed of
the buff sandstone that has been
used in the buildings of the main
quadrangles, and in architecture it
will follow Byzantine ideas. It
will be fully fireproof. No money
or effort will be spared to make
the building perfect.
In preparing the plans, the needs
for years to come have been pro
vided for. In the center will be a
circular reading room, seventy-five
feet in diameter, and radiating
away from this in a semicircle will
be the book-stacks, whose capacity
will be about eight hundred and
fifty thousand volumes. This

method of placing the stacks re
sults in every book being easy of
access. Elsewhere there will be ac
commodation for one hundred and
fifty thousand volumes, making
the total capacity one million. Be
sides this there will be rooms de
voted solely to some of the more
important collections, like the Hop
kins railroad library, the Thomas
Welton Stanford Australian li
brary, the Hildebrand collection,
and others. In all the arrange
ments the best features of the dif
ferent college and general libraries
of the world will be combined, and
it is hoped within a reasonable
time to build up a library that will
be the best of any college in the
United States.
