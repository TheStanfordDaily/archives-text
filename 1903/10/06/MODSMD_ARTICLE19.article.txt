The Macmillan Company of New
York has jirst published a treatise
on electro-magnetic theory, by S. J.
Barnett, assistant professor in the
Department of Physics. It is an
nounced as "a simple, rigorous,
and thoroughly modern treatment
of the more fundamental portions
of electrical theory, with applica
tion to particular cases (including
electrical measurements) in concise
and definite form."
"A Text-book of Plant Physiol
ogy/' by Dr. George J. Peirce, of
the Department of Physiology, was
published in the summer. The
book has about two hundred and
ninety pages and thirty illustra

Dr. Peirce. The volume is a text
for universities and a reference-book
for teachers of secondary schools.
A. A. Lawson, instructor in Hot
any, is the author of two pamphlets
printed by the University of Chi
cago Press. The first is on "Studies

mation, proving that a centrosome
as a spindle-forming organ does
not exist in higher plants. The
discussion is followed by two double
plates and a list of literature used.
The second work is "On the Rela
tionship of the Nuclear Membrane
to the Protoplast." The experi
ments performed on cell-formation
are described. There is one plate,
followed by a general summary of
the work.
The Oxford Press will issue
next summer an edition of all
of Schiller's poems, edited and fully
annotated by Dr. Julius Goebel of
the German department.
In the 1904 edition of the Goethe
Jahrbuch Dr. Goebel will have a
lengthy article on Goethe and Her

the hundredth anniversary of the
death of Herder.
There will be issued in the spring
by Henry Holt & Company of

This will be fully annotated, and is
intended for university class use or
general reading.
Dr. C. H. Gilbert, head of the
Zoology department, and E. C.
Starks, Zoology assistant, are the
authors of a book on "Fishes of
Panama Bay." It will be a book
of one hundred and fifty pages,
with thirty-three plates. It is to
appear early next year. This is
the first book published by Dr.
Gilbert on the expedition conducted
by him and sent out by Timothy
Hopkins in 1896. A study of all
the fishes of the adjacent islands,
coral reefs, and mainland was
made.
