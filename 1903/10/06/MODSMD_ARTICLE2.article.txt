# Notes of the Stock Farm.
## 
### 
A general sale of stallions, brood
mares, and one-year-olds will take
place at the Stock Farm in Novem
ber. The horses will be disposed
of by private sale and public
auction.
Thirty head, most of which are
colts, have been sold at private
sale during the past several months.
This reduces the number of ani
mals to such an extent that a much
greater acreage of the farm was
putin grain this year.
By taking a record of 2:09£ at
Lexington recently Adebell makes
his dam, Beautiful Bells, the cham
pion brood mare of the world, as
she has had ten colts all of which
excelled this time. She has also
produced the world's yearling
champion, Hinda Rose 2:36 A, and
Chimes, a great sire of extreme
speed. The sale of Monbells in
November will bring the value of
this old mare's colts past the
$250,000 mark. This famous horse,
who has reached the age of thirty
one years, is still alive at the Stock
Farm.
