# PLAY PALO ALTO.
## Freshmen Will Meet Former Rivals in Place of Oakland High. 
### 
Owing to the fact that the facul
ty of Oakland high school, which
was scheduled to meet the Stanford
Freshmen tomorrow, refused to al
low them to play, Treasurer Cowden
has secured another game with the
Palo Alto Athletic Club, who have
already defeated the Freshmen.
The Palo Alto team has practiced
considerably since the last contest
and is stronger than when it met
1907. But last week the California
Freshmen defeated Palo Alto 12-0.
Weller at full, Dole at half, Stott
at quarter, and Butterfield at
tackle, will play with the Fresh
men for the first time this year,
and the addition of these men who
have been playing on the Varsity
squad should add materially to
Stanford's strength. The game will
be called at 4. The line-up follows:
