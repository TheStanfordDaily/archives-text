# LECTURE ON CHINA.
## Leong Kai-Chen Spoke in Chapel on Question of Chinese Reform. 
### 
A large audience gathered in the
University chapel this afternoon to
hear Honorable Leong Kai-Chen,
grand vice-president of the Chinese
Reform Association. Dr. Jordan,
in introducing the first speaker,
took occasion to outline the circum
stances that had given rise to the
association, and the object of Leong
Kai-Chen's visit. Pow Chee, sec
retary to Leong Kai-Chen, was
introduced by Dr. Jordan and
spoke at some length on the birth
of the reform movement in China.
When the movement was first
organized, Leong Kai-Chen was
recognized as one of the ablest
assistants of Kang-yu-Wei, the
leader. The movement was stamped
out in its infancy by the Dowager
Empress and the lives of the two
leaders were saved only by the
exertions of diplomatic representa
tives of England and Japan.
Kang-Yu-Wei came to Canada,
where lie established the Chinese
Empire Reform Association, an or
ganization whose name is explana
tory of its work, and whose growth
during the last four years has
reached five million adherents,
located in every country in the
world. Pow Chee showed that
China needs teachers, engineers,
philosophers â€”men to train the
Chinese in the ways of civilization.
China looks to the Uniied States
for these men, and for any young
Americans with brains and energy
there is a successful career waiting
in China.
Before introducing Leong Kai-
Chen Dr. Jordan spoke of the
success that Homer Lee, '01, had
found in China. At present this
Stanford graduate is in command
of an army of 60,000 native troops.
Leong Kai-Chen spoke in Chinese,
which Pow Chee interpreted.
Speaking of the pleasure he expe
rienced at being in this new world,
he said, in part: "You are new men,
new ladies; I come from an old
country; but countries are not
compared by the age of the nation,
but by the hearts of the people.
The center of civilization has
changed from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. I can see it crossing to
China, until China shall become
the greatest nation of the world."
He ended his brief talk with an
earnest plea that energetic young
Americans come to China and
make her the seat of their life
work.
