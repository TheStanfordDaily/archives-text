While it is undisputed that the
ties which bind a class together are
of the weakest order until the inter
collegiate Freshman game has borne
home to every man the fact that he
is a member of a great organization,
1907 must be scored for its indiffer
ence to class matters. Nearly a
week has elapsed since the Varsity
yell leader called attention to the
fact that the Freshman class had
no yell, and yet with their inter
collegiate game little more than a
week distant no yell has putin an
appearance. The same spirit of
indifference has been displayed in
regard to class organization. Since
the fictitious election perpetrated
by the Sophomores the men of 1907
have been too indifferent to elect
officers and put their class on a
firm footing. The Freshmen should
do something to show that they are
entitled to take their place by the
side of those classes which have
preceded them. The first requisite
is that they get a good yell with
which to cheer their team to vic
tory.
