# ALBATROSS FISHES ARRIVE.
## Collection of Specimens From Alaskan Waters Reached Campus Yesterday. 
### 
The specimens of star-fishes, sea
urchins, devil-fishes, and squids
gathered by the Albatross expedi
tion this summer have arrived and
been unloaded.
The specimens taken by the
Albatross on its trip in the Alaskan
waters this summer were taken off
the ship at Seattle. Previously
they were divided en route. They
are to be sent to specialists all over
the United States. From Seattle
as a distributing point the speci
mens were sent in two lots, one of
which went to Washington, D. C.
The other assignment was sent to
Stanford. In this collection are
some smaller groups which will be
taken up in a final report by Dr.
Harold Heath of the Zoology de
partment and W. K. Fish, an
assistant in the same department.
The commission, in addition to a
voluminous report on the speci
mens, will also make a report on
the founding and regulating of
hatcheries. When completed it
will be the most comprehensive re
port ever made of Alaskan fishes.
