# Seminary Room Changes.
## 
### 
The History seminary quarters
have been moved from its rooms
to those heretofore occupied by the
Economics department in the Li
brary. The History department
will have the use of the adjoining
rooms also, where the Education
department was located before it
moved to its new building in the
inner quad. The Economics semi
nary work will now he carried on
in the old History seminary room.
The transfer of books has already
been made. In the old Education
room, now the overflow quarters of
the History department, are being
transferred all of the miscellaneous
United States government publica
tions which were stored in the
basement of the Library.
