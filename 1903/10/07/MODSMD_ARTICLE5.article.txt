# FOOTBALL GAMES POSTPONED.
## Interchange of Preliminary Varsity Contests Put Off Until Next Week. 
### 
The exchange of preliminary
games between the California and
Stanford Varsity elevens has been
postponed from Saturday until
Wednesday or Thursday of next
week. The change was made at
the suggestion of the California
management, who prefer to have
the next game on their own cam
pus. The opponents of the Varsity
teams in the games next week will
be the same as originally an
nounced. Reliance will play Cali
fornia and Stanford will meet the
team from Fort Baker.
Instead of the California-
Reliance game for Saturday after
noon Treasurer Cowden has
scheduled a contest between the
Varsity and the team from the
Goat Island Naval Training Acad
emy. The Naval team has made
several strong additions since its
last appearance on the campus.
New arrangements have been
made with the Santa Clara College
players whereby their team will
meet the Freshmen on the Stanford
campus next Tuesday afternoon at
four o'clock. This game, together
with the California-Reliance con
test, makes two events of unusual
interest for the middle of next
week.
The Freshman intercollegiate
contest is but ten days away, and
from now on the team that will
represent 1907 will take on more
definitely the personnel of the final
line-up. At practice Monday G.
E. Dole was taken from the Varsity
squad and put in at half-back on
the first-year eleven, Stott was
also removed to the quarter-back's
position, which in all probability
he will fill in the game. Butter
field has been taken off the Varsity
squad and is being tried at tackle
on the Freshman eleven, and Wel
ler put in at full-back. As
Chalmers is not eligible for the
Freshman team on account of too
late registration he will probably
be left on the Varsity squad. Were
it not for the loss of Chalmers, the
Freshmen would have a set of
backs whose strength would not be
far below that of the Varsity.
At last night's practice the first
and second Freshman elevens went
through a few minutes of fast and
hard scrimmage work. The time
of the playing was not sufficient
for either side to score, although
the first eleven had far the better
of the game. The Varsity squad
also lined up. The work of the
backs on both the first and second
teams w;\s good. W. Dole, I). Tar
pey, and Scholfield played behind
the line for the Varsity, and P.
Tarpey, Chalmers, and Shine for
the Second eleven. The scrimmage
work was slow on account of the
interruption for coaching between
downs. Dr. A. B. Spalding, '9(5,
who was assistant coach in 1901,
was on the field last night, giving
special coaching to the candidates
for end.
