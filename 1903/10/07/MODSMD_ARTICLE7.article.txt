# MAY USE SHELLS.
## University of Washington Makes Proposition on Coming Boating Regatta. 
### 
Communications have been re
ceived by Prof. A. W. Smith in re
gard to the proposed three-cornered
regatta next April between Cali
fornia, Washington, and Stanford.
Washington has no barges to
match those of California or Stan
ford, so it is the desire of Wash
ington and California that the
match be rowed in shells. None of
the universities have shells, so
Washington proposes to send to
Cornell for one for each college.
These will cost $250 apiece in get
ting three together, and $275 if
purchased singly. The freight on
each shell would amount to $50,
thus making the total cost of each
$800. Both Washington and Cal
ifornia are anxious to buy shells;
and although the plan seems a
good one,the Stanford Boat Club is
undecided in its course, on account
of lack of finances. The club will
hold a meeting in a few days and
decide what is to be done.
California has on hand at pres
ent about $300, and considerable
money will be added to this as a
result of the entertainment at Idora
Park Thursday evening. The
lease of the park lias been given
free and the students are to receive
forty per cent of the gate receipts.
