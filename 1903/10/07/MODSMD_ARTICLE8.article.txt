# More Track Men Out.
## 
### 
The pleasant weather and the
fine condition of the track have
induced a great many of the old
track men to appear for work this
week. Trainer Moulton reports
considerable progress in the work
of the substituting gymnasium
sections. The vaulting standards
have been erected, and the ground
around them has been covered
thickly with sawdust. The dirt for
the runways will be hauled in a
few days. Holman, captain of the
track team, will not arrive on the
campus before November Ist. In
a letter to Trainer Moulton he
states that his departure has been
unavoidably delayed. He has in
structed Moulton to assume charge
of the track squad in the mean
time and supervise the fall train
ing. The trainer is now at work
on a plan for a handicap field-meet.
The date for this event will be
announced shortly.
