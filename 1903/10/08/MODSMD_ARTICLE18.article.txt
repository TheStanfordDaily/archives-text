at the close of his European trip.
He left the University at the close
of last semester on a year's leave
of absence, and is at present in
London. Recently he delivered a
course of lectures at Birmingham
on child study. While no definite
announcement has been made that
Professor Starbuck will not resume
his work at Stanford next fall, it is
known that he is considering sev
eral offers from Eastern institu
tions, among which is Western
Reserve. He has stated to several
of his friends that he will not come

Professor Starbuck came to
Stanford in the fall of 1898 from
Clark University, where he had
taught for the two previous years.
He received his A. B. at Indiana
in 1890, his A. M. at Harvard in
1895, and his doctor's degree at
Clark University in 1897.
