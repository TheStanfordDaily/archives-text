# Dr. Branner on Leave.
## 
### 
Dr. J. C. Branner, vice-president
of the University and head of the
Geology and Mining department,
will leave shortly before Christmas
for his regular sabbatical vacation.
He does not know just exactly
where he will spend the year in
which he will be away from the
University, but Europe may be
visited in the course of the year.
Dr. Branner's sabbatical vacation
was due to have commenced this
semester, but owing to the stress of
work, his departure was deferred
until Christmas. The courses in
mining and geology, usually given
by Dr. Branner, will be given next
semester by Dr. Newsom.
