# SIX TO FIVE
## Freshmen Easily Defeated Yesterday by Palo Alto High School Team. 
### 
It fell to the lot of the light Palo
Alto high school eleven yesterday
afternoon to give the Freshmen
their third defeat. The school team
played in ragged form, but the
Freshmen were even worse. With
the exception of the backs and
ends, the first-year candidates
played listlessly and without force.
Of real practice for the Freshman
team there are about six days left
before the intercollegiate contest.
The amount of improvement yet to
be made in order to put the Fresh
men in shape to win can hardly be
accomplished within the remain
ing time unless there is immediate
improvement. There are only four
or five men on the Bqad who are
playing in good form for a Fresh
man team.
The game started by a kick-off
from the high school. The Fresh
men were downed on the twenty
yard line. Weller was sent through
center and guards for fifteen yards
on three consecutive bucks. Twenty
yards were covered onj cross-bucks
and short end runs. Then came a
quarter-back play on which Stag
ner carried the ball down a clear
field for a fifty-yard sprint to a
touchdown. Dole failed to kick a
goal. Palo Alto kicked off again
to Brennan, who ran in forty yards.
The remainder of the half was
slow and uninteresting.
The second half opened with the
most spectacular play of the season.
Dole kicked off to Swain, who re
ceived the ball on the five-yard
line. He started down the field
with little interference and made
his way through the entire Fresh
man eleven to a touchdown.
