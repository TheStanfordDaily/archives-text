### 
TheEnglishClub last night elected
Miss Alice Kimball,'o4, president.to
succeed H. R. Johnson, '04, who is
not in college this semester. C. B.
Goddard, '04, was elected vice
president, to succeed Miss Kimball.
Norman Collyer, '04, remains
secretary-treasurer. Miss Kimball
has long been one of the most active
members of the English Club. For
several semesters she has been a
member of the executive committee.
She was a member of the 1904
Quad board, and has been on the
boards of the various women's edi
tions of the college papers. Miss
Clara M. Lathrop, '06, and P. C.
Edwards, '06, have been elected to
membership in the club.
An important project that the
club has in view was discussed last 1
night. The organization is plan
ning to procure a series of papers
that will preserve and make access
ible to all Stanford people, and
others who may be interested, an
account of the unique life that was
lived in the pioneer days of the
University —days which will be
less and less understood by the new
generations of Stanford people un
less those who went through them
make some permanent record of
their experiences while the memory
of them is still comparatively
fresh. It is proposed to have dif
ferent phases of pioneer life treated
in separate papers suitable to be
read to members of the English
Club and their guests at the meet
ings to be held this year. Subse
quently, during the summer if
possible, it is planned to have the
papers published together in book
form, so that they may be widely
distributed.
In order that the project may be
successfully carried out, a careful
plan has been prepared. Each
paper will have a definite field to
itself, and it is intended that all
the papers together shall give a
comprehensive view of the pioneer
life in all its phases. To this end
a tentative list of chapter headings
has been prepared and appropriate
topics suggested. The general
headings so far selected are as fol
lows: Planning the University;
Starting the Machinery; The Do
mestic Side of the Pioneer Days;
Amusements; Life in the Dormi
tories; The Fraternities, Camp,etc.;
Athletics; Other Undergraduate
Activities; The Beginnings in Palo
Alto; The Lawsuit.
The club will try to enlist the
active cooperation of all those who
can furnish documents and remin
iscences that would make an
account of those days most valu
able. Those who possess good ma
terial which they cannot themselves
handle will be asked to furnish it
to the committee of the club which
has the project in charge. This
committee, which is composed of
Mrs. L. K. Matthews,'o4, Mrs. O.
L. Elliott, and Mr. S. S. Seward,
Jr., will distribute the material to
those who would most appropri
ately use it.
