# VARSITY VS. PENSACOLA.
## Contest Tomorrow Promises to Be an Easy Victory for Stanford. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 the
Varsity will meet the Naval
Training Academy eleven from
Goat Island for the second time.
Since the Naval team was beaten
by Stanford 17 to 0 and by Cali
fornia 51 to 0 it has been doing
daily practice and has added
greatly to its strength and team
work. Last Saturday the Califor
nia players ran the ends of the
sailors for touchdown after touch
down. The most good to the
Varsity cannot result from long
end runs which could be easily
made, but rather from heavy work
at the line. Tomorrow's contest
will probably be a bucking and
punting game.
The line-up will be as follows:
STANFORD PifiNSACOLA
Smith 1 e r Ray
Sprott 1 t r Smolien
Thompson. .. . 1 g r Acuff
Hauverman... c Hall
Hyde r g 1 Bache
Stillman r t 1 Tople
Preston r e 1 Hull
Bansbach .... q Dare
D. Tarpey... .1 hr McClure
G. E. Dole. ...r h 1 Considine
Scholfield .... 112 Jones
Last night's practice is sufficient
evidence that their ragged showing
on Wednesday has brought on the
Freshmen the almost complete
attention of the coaches for the rest
of the practice season. Yesterday
they were given a full course of
football from the rudiments to the
hardest kind of scrimmage work.
The two first-year teams bucked
each other hard, and G. E. Dole
finally carried the ball over the
line for the first eleven. Several
new plays were tried during the
practice, which lasted for nearly
two hours.
Weller is out of practice with a
bad leg. The injury is not serious
enough to keep him out of the
Freshman contest and he will
probably be on the field again
Monday. His position was tilled
last night by Stephenson.
