Although the boating project
has leached no culmination
in an intercollegiate race, those
in charge of the arrangements for
getting the sport firmly established
at Stanford have been untiring in
their efforts. Several obstacles
arose that are as yet unremoved,
and the club has to choose from
several possibilities that offer
themselves. In any event it is
very improbable that Stanford can
participate in the proposed three
cornered race with California and
Washington. Many reasons have
asserted themselves why Stan
ford should not consider an
intercollegiate regatta next spring.
The sport is, in the first place, new
to the University. The period of
training will neceesarily be very
short, on account of the delay in
getting a boat-house. Both Cali
fornia and Washington have the
sport well established, and are in
condition for a race. The fact that
Stanford would be thus handi
capped should not ordinarily deter
her from being represented, but the
short period of training will find
the Stanford crew bo seriously
handicapped that it is to be ques
tioned whether the race would
assume the proportions of a con
test. As far as sport is concerned,
this fact should not enter at all,
but incalculable harm would ac
crue to the University by sending
into a great race a poorly equipped
and insufficiently trained crew.
The sport must be first firmly
established, and that can be best
brought about by a series of class
regattas next spring. This is the
most plausible scheme, and one
that finds favor with the Boating
Club.
