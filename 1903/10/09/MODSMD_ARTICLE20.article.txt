# DR. LOEB'S LECTURE.
## Sketch of Famous Scientist Who Will Speak Tuesday Night in Chapel. 
### 
Dr. Jacques Loeb, who will lec
ture in the chapel next Tuesday
evening, is a physiologist of wide
fame. His researches in fertiliza
tion, artificial parthenogenesis, and
the physico-chemical factors in life
processes have made him one of
the conspicuous figures in modern
biology. The significance of these
researches, as pointed out by Dr.
Loeb and other biologists of his
manner of thinking, is of profound
importance in radically modifying
many of our long held views of vi
tal phenomena. The use of mod
ern discoveries of the physical
chemists in biological investiga
tions, a method widely used in
present day physiological study, is
chielly due to Loeb's example.
Dr. Loeb is professor of compara
tive physiology in the University
of California. He came last fall
from the University of Chicago to
fill this chair. Last month a new
physiological laboratory was spe
cially built there for Dr. Loeb.
Loeb's training in biology was had
in German universities. His first
appointment in this country was
at Bryn Mawr.
Dr. Loeb's lecture will deal with
some of his most recent researches
and discoveries, and will be of in
tense interest to all students of bi
ology and medicine, and to the
faculty and student body generally.
The lecture is given under the aus
pices of the Stanford chapter of the
Sigma Xi scientific society and will
be free.
