# TRAINING-HOUSE MATTERS.
## Vacancies in Board May be Filled This Month.â€” State of Finances. 
### 
A meeting of the Training-House
Corporation has not been held this
semester owing to the fact that a
quorum can not be obtained until
the return of J. E. McDowell, '00,
from Japan. McDowell is expect
ed to arrive in San Francisco the
25th of the month. The date for a
meeting was set last semester to
elect two vacancies on the board,
but owing to the illness of two or
three of the members, the election
could not take place. There are
two vacancies on the board, caused
by the resignation of C. A. Cant
well, '03, and Mil nor Roberts, '99.
The board at present is composed
of H. H. Taylor, '00, J. E. Mc-
Dowell, '00, T. J. Hoover, '01, J.
B. Gildersleeve, '03.
The Training-House Corporation
was started with the idea of build
ing a training-house for the use of
student athletics, but since the new
gymnasium will make ample train
ing provisions the money already
on hand will probably lie used for
an athletic field. The corporation
now has about six thousand dollars.
With this as a nucleus, the ground
allotted on the campus for athlet
ics will be laid out in different
fields for the various branches of
athletics. This tract consists of
about forty acres east of the faculty
club-house. The consummation of
this project may not be reached for
three or four years, but in view of
the intention to hold the intercol
legiate football game on the cam
pus of each university in alternate
years, the work will be rushed as
fast as possible. The cash now on
hand constitutes a very small part
of the final cost of the grounds.
The remainder will be gotten to
gether in various ways to be adopt
ed later by the corporation.
