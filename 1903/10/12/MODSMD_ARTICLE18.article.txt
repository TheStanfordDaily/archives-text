### 
The Sigma Xi scientific society,
under whose auspices the recent
lecture of Dr. Gifford Pinchot, head
of the government bureau of for
estry, was given, and which has
arranged for the lecture by Dr.
Loeb tomorrow night, is a society
with branches or chapters in fifteen
of the leading American universi
ties. Its objects are the encourage
ment and promotion of scientific
research, and its members are
elected from among faculty mem
bers and advanced students, on a
basis of activity in scientific inves
tigation.
The society is in many ways
like Phi Beta Kappa, its elections
being honorary and based on schol
arship, only in the case of Sigma
Xi this scholarship is in scientific
lines and must be productive. The
Stanford chapter was established
in 1902, and has a present mem
bership, so far restricted to mem
bers of tlie faculty, alumni, and
graduate students, of about thirty
five.
