# Discuss Northern Trip.
## 
### 
The Combined Musical Clubs
met Friday and discussed the pro
posed northern trip of the clubs
during the Christmas vacation.
Treasurer Cowden does not intend
that the tour shall be made unless
the clubs are sure that it will be a
financial success, and that the
clubs will be well received. To
arouse interest in the different
cities on the route the president
selected a member of the club from
each of the proposed towns. These
men are to work up interest in
the clubs in their separate towns.
The points touched will probably
be the same as last year, with a
few exceptions.
B. E. Nourse, '04, resigned as
president of the Combined Clubs.
This leaves vacant the offices of
president and secretary-treasurer.
The latter was caused by the resig
nation of H. B. Sharpe, ex-'O3.
The election for new officers will
take place in the chapel at 4:30
Friday afternoon.
