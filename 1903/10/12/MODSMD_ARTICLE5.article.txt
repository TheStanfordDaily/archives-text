# EASY VICTORY FOR VARSITY.
## Naval Academy Team Proved No Match for Stanford Eleven Saturday. 
### 
Saturday's contest was a poor
exhibition of football. The game
was too one-sided to even give op
portunity for judging the improve
ment and real strength of the
Varsity eleven at this time. The
score of 34 to 0 could as well have
been doubled had the Cardinal
players chosen to carry the ball
over the line on end runs and
bucks. Instead the contest offered
an opportunity for practice on field
goals, and although the unsuccess
ful attempts in this direction were
not surprising, they gave further
evidence of the fact that the kick
ing ability of the punters is defi
cient. The team work and forma
tion of the Stanford team showed
up in excellent shape.
As to the playing of the Pensa-1
colas little can be said that vs
favorable. Jones, the full-back,
and McKee at left end, played hard
and steady football.
The feature of the first half of
the game was a field-goal from the
fifteen-yard line on a drop-kick by
Wilfred Dole. This with two
touchdowns and one goal made a
score of 1G to 0 in the first half.
Sprott missed both trials for field
goals in the first of the game and
in the second. He kicked two
goals during the game and missed
one. M. P. Hyde tried the goals
for the last two touchdowns and
made them both. Three touch
downs in the second half made the
final score 34 to 0.
