# FRESHMEN VS. SANTA CLARA.
## 1907 Will Play its Last Game Tomorrow Before Intercollegiate Contest Saturday. 
### 
The last and most important pre
liminary contest for the 1907 foot
hall team will he played on the
oval tomorrow afternoon at 3:00
o'clock against the Santa Clara
College team. Last Thursday the
California freshman team defeated
Santa Clara five to nothing. The
score was made on a place-kick
and the game was hard fought.
A comparison of the result with
that of tomorrow's game will give
at least a rough estimate of the
comparative strength of the two
first-year teams.
The interchange of preliminary
contests between the Stanford and
California varsities, which was
scheduled for Wednesday, has heen
given up entirely. Stanford will
play the Fort Baker team on the
oval Wednesday afternoon.
Treasurer Cowden has arranged
for the starting of a training-table
at the Harris Cafe tomorrow noon.
When thelnn opens, one week from
today, the table will be moved to
the campus. The following men
will be taken to the table tomorrow:
Hauverman, Thompson, Hyde,
Sprott, Stillman, J'reston, Clark,
Bansbach, W. Dole, D. Tarpey and
