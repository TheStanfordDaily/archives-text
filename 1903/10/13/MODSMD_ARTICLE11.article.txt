# FRESHMAN PRACTICE.
## Preliminary Work Shows Probable Personnel of Team in Saturday's Game. 
### 
Unusual effort is now being put
forth by the coaches to bring out
the best there is in the candidates
for the Freshman football eleven.
From the line-up in today's game
a very approximate prophecy can
be made as to the candidates who
will compose the final line-up. The
only doubtful matter is where Wel
ler is going to play. His great
weight could be well used on the
line, which is weak in the extreme.
Stephenson, who has been putting
up a good game at fullback during
the entire season, is too strong a
player to be left out of the final
line-up, and in case Weller is
made fullback there is a possibility
that Stephenson will displace Kelly
on left end. G. E. Dole and Bren
nan are the stronger of the candi
dates for halfback and will un
doubtedly be the men to go into
these positions at the start, with
Packard as first substitute. Stott
is a fixture at quarter and Morrow
will play at right end. True and
Butterfield are holding down the
tackles' positions in good shape.
Unless either one is displaced by
Weller both will be in the big game.
Zimmerman and Smith are the
best men as guards, but this part
of the line is weakest. Hornby and
Molfino have an equal chance for
center.
The practice last night consisted
of running both squads through sig
nal practice and some new forma
tions. This work was rapid and
the plays were executed in fairly
good form. Both squads lined up
for twenty minutes of heavy scri
mage work.
