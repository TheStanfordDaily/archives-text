The success of the song competi
tion is highly gratifying. The fact
that some thirty-five different com
petitors entered the contest shows
what can be done by arousing the
interest of the students. A college
song was sorely needed. Now that
we have some new good songs it
only remains for every student to
learn them at once. The new
books will be out in time for the
rally Friday, and Stanford's sing
ing and cheering at the game Sat
urday should be such as to serve as
an indication of the spirit that pre
vails this season. In many re
spects the present year is one of the
best that Stanford spirit and
Stanford athletics have seen for
some time. With anything but
glowing prospects, the whole tone
from the first has been one of hope
and enthusiastic confidence in the
football squad. Coaches, captain,
players, and rooters have all re
flected the true ideal of Stanford.
Win or lose, the atmosphere that
has pervaded the campus has signi
fied that the reputation of the Uni
versity must he upheld. Most
noticeable of all the things that
augur good is the conduct of the
bleachers toward visiting teams.
One conclusion can be drawn, and
that is that the two intercollegiate
contests ahead are to be conspicu
ous for the gentlemanly and cour
teous conduct of the rival bleachers.
Purity and cleanliness of sport are
most desired, and the way toward
these ends can best be cleared by
the vow of every student to be
gentlemanly above all.
