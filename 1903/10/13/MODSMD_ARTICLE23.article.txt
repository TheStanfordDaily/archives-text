The training-table for the Cali
fornia football squad started yes
terday. The following twelve men
were taken on: Overall, Stow,
Stroud, Heitmuller, Howard, De
merritt, Hudson, More. Mini, Whip
ple. Risley, Muther.
The varsity is slowly rounding
into shape and barring serious ac

cidents, its personnel may be fairly
predicted. Hudson and Demeritt,
both old men, are without rivals
for the end positions. Force and
Howard are fighting for right tack
le with a slight advantage in favor
of Force. Heitmuller is sure of a
position at left tackle on account
of his strong offensive work. Stow
and Overall at guard cannot be
displaced, but Overall has not yet
reached his last year't excellence.
Stroud will retain the center posi
tion. In the back-field, conditions
are different. More, who played
quarter last year, is being tried at
full-back and Belknap, Geary and
Graves are fighting for More's old
place at quarter. At left half,
Kittrell, Risley and Muther are
showing up in the order named,
with Mini, of last year's squad as
one of the possibilities. Whipple
and Snediger have equal chances
for left half. Boynton, Sterns, More
and Keman are candidates for
full-back, but none of them is up
in form.
