# REV. HEMPHILL SPEAKS.
## San Francisco Divine Preaches Morning Sermon in Memorial Church. 
### 
The morning sermon in Memo
rial Church Sunday was preached
by the Rev. John Hemphill, D. D.,
of the Calvary Presbyterian Church
of San Francisco. He took as his
text Rev. 21:13: "On the east three
gates; on the north three gates; on
the south three gates; and on the
west three gates."
"No man," began Dr. Hemphill,
"need miss heaven,for Christ is the
way to it, and the gates swing open
from every side to receive him.
Heaven must be a transcendently
beautiful place, but there is more
than the architectural beauty in
the words—there is a deeper spir
itual meaning. Christ is an ap
proachable Christ, a many-sided
Christ, anyone's savior. There are
many gateways, adapted to each
seeker. One can never enter the
kingdom through some other gate.
There are twelve gates, —choose
your own. The twelve Apostles,
who had gained the right to enter
the Holy City, each entered by his
own gateway. God's mercy can
not be limited. We dare not limit
its wideness. This end is the spir
itual truth embodied in the text.
There is a gate for every corner.
The Christ of God stands four
square. He can be approached on
all sides, and easiest on the side
you most need him."
Dr. Hemphill then spoke of the
four gateways: The gateway of the
east, of the rising sun; the gateway
of the north; the gateway on the
south; and the gateway on the
west.
Rev. Gardner preached in the
afternoon at the regular Sunday
afternoon organ recital. Miss Fos
ter of Palo Alto sang Schnecker's
"Lead, Kindly Light."
