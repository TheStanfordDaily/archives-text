# ARRANGEMENTS COMPLETED.
## University Inn Will Be Ready to Serve Meals Next Monday. 
### 
Definite arrangements have been
completed for the re-opening of the
Inn. Mrs. Helen A.Carter, who
is at present managing the Wo
men's Exchange of San Francisco,
will conduct the eating-house. The
work of painting and remodeling
the interior of the building has
been finished and the place is
ready for occupancy. The first
meals will probably be served Mon
day, October 19th.
It is not the idea of the new
management to serve meals as
cheaply as possible, but to give
better service than before. The
price of board will approximate
$5.00 a week, and no rebate will be
given for meals which are missed.
This is a system which has been
found most satisfactory by the
other boarding-houses on the cam
pus. Formerly the Inn gave a
rebate of twenty cents a meal if
six or more consecutive meals were
missed, but this system was not at
all practicable. This will do away
with the old ticket system. There
will be arrangements for transient
boarders as before.
Students will be employed aB
waiters and to fill as many other
positions as seems advisable. The
new undertaking is somewhat of an
experiment in that it is uncertain
whether there will be a sufficient
number of patrons to insure suc
cess. If the undertaking is not a
success the Inn will be closed
inside of a month.
