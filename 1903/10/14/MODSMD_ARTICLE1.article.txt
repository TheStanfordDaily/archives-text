# THREE ADDRESS ASSEMBLY.
## Dr. Jordan, Dr. Murray, and Field, '95, Gave Interesting Talks This Morning. 
### 
Addresses were made at the Uni
versity Assembly this morning by
President .Jordan. Dr. Murray,
bead of tbe Greek department, and
Cbarles K. Field, '95. Dr. Jordan's
speech was brief, and was for tbe
purpose of commending the work
that is being done in the University
by the Christian Associations.
Referring to the Inn, Dr. Jordan
said the failures of the past were
plninly traceable to incompetent
and negligent management. Com
plaint had been made that the rent
of the Inn building was too high.
Dr. Jordan said the charge was not
too high for a building of the kind,
and if the place were properly
patronized, the rent would be but
inconsiderable. It was not the poli
cy of the University to give any
thing free except tuition, and no
exception would be made. He said
that with proper patronage he felt
assured that the new management
would be able to run it successfully.
Dr. Murray spoke of the neces
sity of maintaining the Student
Guild Hospital. Such an institu
tion is absolutely necessary for a
place located so far from the city,
for any member of the University
community might be stricken down
so suddenly that removal to the
distant city hospital would per
haps mean death. The charge of
one dollar a day levied upon
patients, he said, was almost nomi
nal, and should cause no complaint.
Field, '95, was accorded a warm
reception. He spoke of the disap
pointment that comes over an old
alumnus when he returns to his
college and finds that he is forgot
ten. It is a keen disappointment
to find none that he knows, and
few that remember his name, for
when an alumnus comes back lie
wants to sit down and talk of pio
neer days. The pioneers had a
great deal to do with laying the
foundation of the Stanford spirit
of today, and what gave the Stan
ford spirit its right start was En
cina Hall. For two years after the
opening of the University all the
men lived in the big hall. Fra
ternities were only in the making.
From close association the men
came to know each other, and here
began the true Stanford college
spirit. It was interesting to exam
ine the development, of that spirit.
The democracy of the institution
was vital, and if that weakened the
University would lose her strength.
Field spoke of false stories that
were circulated and spread abroad,
and appealed to loyal Stanford
people to beware of vandalism of
speech. He ended by citing a re
cent instance of true Stanford
spirit—the action of 11. C. Hoover,
'95, in assuming a very large in
debtedness which he was not legal
ly bound to do, but was perhaps
morally responsible for.
During the Assembly the new
football songs were tried and en
thusiastically received. 11. 11.
Lachmund, '06. sang Miss Alice
Kimball's "Cardinal Song " aided
by Glee Club, and Hush and Baker
sang their "Bum 1 Bum 1 Song."
