Since the plan met with almost
universal approval last year, it iB
reasonable to assume that in Sat
urday's game the victors will be
allowed exclusive possession of the
field. A good example has been
set. True sportsmanship will see
to it Saturday that not a single
representative of the losing side
appear on the field during the
celebration that follows a victory.
It is only just to the victors
that they be allowed the fruits of
their victory. Much friction and
ill-feeling can be avoided by care
ful observance of courteous con
duct. Let it be hoped that the
treatment of the rival bleachers in
the coming contest will go much
farther this year in cementing the
good feeling that at present exists
between California andStanford.
