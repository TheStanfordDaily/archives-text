# "Sequoia" Appears Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The fourth number of the Se
quoia, which will he for sale on the
quad tomorrow morning, contains
an article on the Yale Senior Soci
eties, written by a Stanford man
who was a member of one of those
societies. Delmar Reynolds, '05,
contributes a Stanford story called
"Lad's Love," which is perhaps
the best work he has yet done.
Miss Edna Needles has an excellent
story named "Cupid from .Japan."
Miss Gertrude Morrison, '06, a new
writer, signs a peculiar sketch of
child life; in tone and style it is
original. George Barnett, '06, is
the author of a good vignette. Miss
Mabel H. Brown, '03, is the author
of the only verse the number con
tains, besides the poem by Charles
Field, '95, which in the "Book-
Table" is reprinted from Suriset for
October.
The Sequoia editorially makes
an appeal to Stanford writers for
something more substantial than
the "love story" which predomi
nates in their work just now.
