# Gymnasium Baseball Work.
## 
### 
The baseball work of the gymna
sium classes has been materially
changed this year. Instead of going
through regular games the differ
ent sections are given practice in
outfield work by Varsity baseball
players. Later in the season the
regular games may be resumed.
R. B. Ball, '04, Varsity baseball
captain, has charge of the 11:15
class of baseball men, and A. L.
Trowbridge, '05, is coaching the sec
tions from the 5-6 class. The other
classes have no regular coaches.
