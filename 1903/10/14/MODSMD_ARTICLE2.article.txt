# SANTA CLARA DEFEATED.
## Freshmen Win 12-0 Against College Team Weakened by Crippled Players. 
### 
The Stanford Freshmen played a
successful but erratic game yester
day afternoon. One touchdown
and one goal were scored in each
half. Santa Clara was on the
verge of a touchdown at the outset
of the second half, when Magee
broke through the Freshman team
and was downed by Stott twenty
yards from the line. Late in the
half Santa Clara tried a place-kick
from the twenty-yard line, but the
line could not hold and the Fresh
men blocked the kick. The game
was a victory for Stanford, but not
of the clear cut order that might
have been expected when it is taken
into consideration that the inter
collegiate game will be played Sat
urday, and that the team the Fresh
men played yesterday was weak
ened by the absence of four men
who played against California.
Stanford excelled in the work of
her backs and ends. Although
there is not a finished player be
hind the line, there are four men at
least who are strong ground-gain
ers. Brennan and Dole aresteady,
swift of foot, and reliable. Steph
enson is erratic. Once he plunges
into the line in Varsity form and
again be will buck with his head
high in the air. His strong punt
ing makes him a valuable factor,
whether he is placed behind the
line, on end, or at tackle. Weller
did not enter the game until the
end was in sight, but to
his great strength was largely
due the credit for securing Stan
ford's second touchdown. Weller
lacks experience and knowledge of
defensive tactics, but he will play
an important part in advancing
the ball against the California line.
Stott will complete the back-field.
His work at quarter is of first-class
order. He is a strong tackier and
holds the team together well.
At end, Morrow, in spite of his
light weight, was the equal of any
man that played for Stanford yes
terday. His light weight handi
caps him on offensive play, but his
defensive work is of high order, and
he is fast getting down on points.
West is strong and fast.
The fight for the other end lies
between him and Kelly, unless
Stephenson be put into the line.
The tackles played a strong game
yesterday. Both Butterfield and
True are reliable men, but a bad
hole is found at guard. Smith
plays high and was pushed back
repeatedly, while Zimmerman
could not hold his man on the
other side of the line. Ilennisch,
who later took Smith's place, plays
hard. MoKino, at center, was able
to hold his own and broke through
the line in good shape when an oc
casion presented itself.
As a team the formations were
ragged and the defensive play
weak, while the fumbling was bad
for this time of the season. Santa
Clara played a gritty, up hill fight.
Several of her first team men were
kept out by injuries, but Blow at
right guard, Magee at quarter, and
MeClatchy at right half, played
steady, strong football. The game

cannot be used in comparison with
the California victory of 5-0. The
California Freshmen had received
less coaching, and Santa Clara
played with a much stronger team.
