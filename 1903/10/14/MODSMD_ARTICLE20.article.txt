# Basket-ball Plans.
## 
### 
Dr. Storey has tendered a propo
sition to the students desirous of
substituting â€¢ basket-ball for gym
nasium work, and as soon as action
lias been taken by them regular
squads will be formed for out-door
practice. Last year practice was
held in the gymnasium in the in
terval between regular drill hours,
but this interfered too seriously
with the regular work. The court
outside is now the only one avail
able except for regular games.
Of the men who made up the En
cina Gymnasium basket-ball team
last year, all but E. G. Beach, '05,
are still in college; but Lousley, '05,
will be ineligible on account of his
position as gymnasium assistant.
Those available are: Collyer, '04,
captain, Seholfield, '06, Gaither,
'06, Cahoon, '06, Stearns,'o6. Be
sides these there are several second
team men of last year who can de
velop into good form with practice.
The University of California
team has lost three of its best men:
Mosgrove, Ferguson and Junk; but
the latter, who is by far the best
player, will be in college next se
mester.
