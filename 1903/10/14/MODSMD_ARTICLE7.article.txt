# NOTED SCIENTIST LECTURES.
## Dr. Loeb of California Addresses Large Audience in University Chapel. 
### 
A large audience completely
filled the University chapel last
night at the lecture given by Dr.
Jacques Loeb, head of the physi
ology department of the University
of California. The subject chosen
was "Artificial Cross-fertilization
in Starfishes and Sea-urchins."
Dr. Jordan first explained in a
few words the significance of the
Sigma Xi society, under whose
auspices the lecture was given.
Prof. W. R. Dudley, of the Bot
any department, introduced Dr.
Loeb.
Dr. Loeb first thanked the Uni
versity for the hospitality accorded
him at the Hopkins Laboratory in
Pacific tirove, where his experi
ments were carried on. In regard
to his work in cross-fertilization he
said that it seems strange, in spite
of the fact that the sperm and eggs
of starfishes and sea-urchins are
carried great distances in the water,
that hybrids are never found. Only
by several years spent in experi
ments in biology can the difficulty
be removed and explained. To
break down the barriers in the way
of the experiment a great deal of
study is necessary, and it is seen
that the eggs consist of elements
easily capable of variation. For
fertilization an egg and sperm are
necessary. If eggs could be caused
to develop by artificial partheno
genesis, then the crossing of two
distinct forms of animals cculd be
brought about.
No satisfactory conclusions have
resulted from these experiments,
due mainly to the length of time
required. In the fertilization of
marine animals, the constitution
of sea-water has to be considered
as an additional agent. The eggs
of the starfish seem to develop
spontaneously without sperm, but
this is impossible. Carbon dioxide
can take the place of sperm, and
on account of this the eggs of star
fish are easier to experiment, upon.
In the actual hybridization of the
sea-urchin and starfish the sperms
were put into a solution of sea
water in one dish and the eggs in
another, and washed for about five
minutes to dissolve any crust
formed by the salt water. Then
they were put together, and sodium
chloride added. This is necessary,
for the starfish egg and sea-urchin
sperm are not sufficient for fertili
zation alone. The larva resulting
from the cross-fertilization had the
characteristics determined by the
egg. The main difference came in
regard to the skeleton, which was
only rudimentary. This was due
perhaps to chemical disturbance.
From fifty to eighty per cent of the
egtzs of the sea-urchin were fertil
ized by the sperm of the starfish,
hut many died, and this cross
fertilization will have to be
pleted in the future.
