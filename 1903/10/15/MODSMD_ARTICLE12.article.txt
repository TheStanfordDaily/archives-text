# FALL BASEBALL PRACTICE.
## Candidates Will Appear on the Diamond Tuesday and Thursday Afternoons. 
### 
Fall practice for the baseball
men will begin Tuesday afternoon
under tbe direction of Captain
R. B. Ball. Tuesday and Thurs
day afternoons will be given up to
the work at first. Assisting in tbe
coaching will be Cowden, captain
of the '02 team. The idea of this
preliminary practice is to get the
men in good condition for an early
start in the spring. The work at
first will be light, and is to consist
of batting practice and infield
playing.
It is improbable that any prac
tice games will be played. The
captain is mainly desirous of find
ing out what new material is in
college. The fall work will go on
for about a month.

played on the Varsity there will
appear for practice Captain Ball,
'04, third base, Crawford,'o4, short
stop, Blake, '04, first base, Trow
bridge, '05, right field, and Wirt,
'06, right-field. Tritch, '04,
pitcher, and Williams '06, short
stop, are expected to return to
college next semester. The follow
ing second team men are now in
the University: lloosevelt, '04,
Studley, '04, Stillman, '05, Wein
mann, '06, Colbert, '06, Campbell,
'06, and Hales, '06. From the
Freshman class there will prob
ably come out for practice, among
others, Stott and Chalmers of Tort
land Academy, Stagner of Marvs
ville high school, and Kelly of the
Harvard School.
It is not yet known whether Par
ker, pitcher last year, will play

there will be a good race between
Tritch and Sales. In addition, the
entering class may offer some good
players in this branch of the game.
