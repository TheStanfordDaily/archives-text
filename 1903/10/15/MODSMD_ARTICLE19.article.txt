No one should remain away
from the football rally tomorrow
night. Besides showing the team
that the entire University is with
them heart and soul in the coming
contest, the meeting will be of val
uable assistance in starting off the
enthusiasm that must culminate
Saturday in continuous singing
and cheering for the Stanford
players. The new songs must be
learned by tomorrow night, so that
by Saturday everybody will be
able to join in. Last year,
owing to the disorganized seat
ing arrangements at the Fresh
man game, the Stanford yell
ing was miserable, and to those
who did not understand the reasons
the impression was carried that
Stanford waR not supporting its
team. Plenty of seats will be pro
vided this year,—and those who at
tend, —and it goes without saying
that everybody in the University
will be there, —will see to it that the
1907 team is supported as no other
Freshman team has been before.
Every member of 1907 ought to be
at the rally. Their support of the
team will do much to stir up class
spirit and bring about unity of pur
pose. Let the rally and demon
stration tomorrow night be of such
a character as to leave no doubt of
the result in the struggle Saturday.
