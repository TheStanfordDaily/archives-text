# California Notes.

### 
"Mclnnis, or the Two Poppers"
is the title of this year's junior
farce, written by Emil Kruschke,
to be presented by the junior class
at the University of California.
Prof. Leon J. Richardson of
the Latin department at California
has written a Latin song entitled
"Mater Aurea" or "Golden Moth
er." It is similar in spirit to
"Gaudeamue Igitur" the college
classic.
Ground was broken on the Berke
ley campus recently for California
Hall, the new structure designed
to replace old North Hall, which
has become unsafe. The new build
ing, which will be the third to be
erected in accordance with the
Bernard plan, will be of California
white granite and will cost $250,-
000. When completed it will be
used for the offices of the university
and for several large classes. Funds
were provided by an appropriation
passed by the last legislature.
