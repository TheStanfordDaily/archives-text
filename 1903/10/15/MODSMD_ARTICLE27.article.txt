11l an interview Trainer Moulton
makes the following pertinent re
marks on track work:
"From the good healthy condi
tion in which the old men have
returned this year I am satisfied
that they will improve their records
made in the last intercollegiate
field-day. As for the Freshmen, it
is hard to get a line on their capa
bilities. There seem to be several
promising men, but not so many
as 1 expected. The trouble seems
to be a lack of confidence in the
youngsters. They are too prone to
assert 'Oh, so and so can defeat me,
so what is the use of my going out?'
"Now athletes are not supposed
to be in the University athletics
for the sole purpose of winning vic
tories, but for the general result in
health, self-restraint, and manly
competition. And no one knows
what four years of track work may
bring forth. I can recall several
cases where championships and
highest honors have been attained
after two or three years of discour
agements. This year we lose sev
eral good men, and their places
must be filled with new material.
We must also prepare for the next
year and the one after that. We
must build for the future, and we
cannot do it without the help of
the entering class. No matter what
a student comes out for, be it foot
ball, baseball, tennis, or track, he
must appear regularly and stick to
it.
"I want the track men to be in
good condition for the handicap
fall meet, which will be held about
November 21st. This contest stim
ulates interest and gives us a line
on the likely candidates for the big
meet next spring. No one is barred
from track work except those phys
ically unfit and those conditioned
by the faculty. All candidates
must report to Dr. Snow for a
physical examination, and on pre
senting his card to- me they will be
put to work."
