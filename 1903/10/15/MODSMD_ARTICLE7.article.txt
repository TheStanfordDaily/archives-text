# PRACTICE OF TEAMS.
## Heavy Work for the Freshman Squad Will Close Tonight. 
### 
No scrimmage work was done by
either of the football squads last
night. The Freshmen were first
put through rapid formations,
which the}' executed in good form.
This was followed by a long period
devoted to practice of field-goals by
half-back Dole. The second Fresh
man eleven was lined up to break
through the line and block the
kicks. Their attempts were suc
cessful but two or three times.
Dole kicked with fair accuracy,
putting the ball between the up
rights in a majority of the trials.
Stephenson has been transferred to
right tackle and Weller putin at
full-back. Smith has given place
to Shaner at right guard, and the
only probability of any further
change being made is that True,
whose place at tackle has been
taken by Stephenson, may replace
one of the guards. A few minutes'
scrimmage work tonight ended
the season for the Freshmen, with
the possible exception of light sig
nal practice tomorrow afternoon.
Running down on punts and
going through formations consti
tuted the work of the Varsity squad
yesterday. The first team is getting
into better and more rapid form
daily. Hyde and Tarpey were
half-backs on the first eleven. The
former is rather light, but his
punting ability may be considered
great enough to warrant him a po
sition in the big game.
Preston was tried at kicking field
goals and gives evidence of having
the making of an accurate kicker.
Several of his attempts were very
successful and he will no doubt be
given further opportunity in the
kicking line.
