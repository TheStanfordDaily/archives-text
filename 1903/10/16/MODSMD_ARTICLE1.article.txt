# VARSITY DEFEATS SOLDIERS.
## Makes a Score of Fifty-seven to Nothing in a One-sided Contest. 
### 
In just three minutes from the
first kick-off yesterday the Varsity
bucked the Fort Baker line and
ran their ends for seventy-five
yards to the goal-line. The second
touchdown was made in two min
utes, and eight others that were
scored were distributed evenly
through the remaining thirty-five
minutes. In kicking goals Preston
was given a trial and made four
successful attempts. The remain
ing six were tried by Sprott, who
failed 011 three and scored three.
The game dragged on account of
the extreme weakness of the visit
ing team. Lloyd, left end, was the
only player among the soldiers
who showed any great knowledge
of the game. The soldiers had the
weight, but were deficient in foot
ball experience. They made their
yards but twice during the game,
and were easily vulnerable on all
points of the line.
For the most part the Varsity
men played in fine form. M. P.
Hyde was in it left half again, and
gives promise of making a strong
back. He had but few opportuni
ties to punt yesterday, but averaged
thirty-five yards. Tarpey's form
was not up to his usual standard.
Stillman is doing well at tackle,
and may be considered as the most
logical candidate for the position.
O. E. Hyde, at guard, is another
player who may make his Varsity
emblem this year. He plays far
above the other candidates for the
place. Preston seems to have the
advantage over the other candi
dates for right end. The line-up
