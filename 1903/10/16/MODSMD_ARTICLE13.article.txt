Stanford can look forward to
tomorrow's game with hope and
confidence, â€”not particularly stub
born confidence that a Cardinal
victory will be achieved, but that
the Freshman eleven is going to
play like a Stanford team. If they
do that, there can be no doubt that
the entire University will look
back at the results with satisfac
tion. There is every reason for
hope. The'contest will be a close
one. Neither eleven has the ad
vantage, except it be in compara
tive scores. A fast contest may be
looked for. The Cardinal squad
has the weight and ability to wrest
a victory. It now remains with
them to add the first intercollegiate
one to this year's athletic calendar.
We believe that they can do it.
Eight intercollegiate contests are
ahead in the coming year. The
season can be started best by a
victory tomorrow. We look to the
Freshmen for that. It should be
the duty of every student, and
by all means of every Freshman,
to be at the Richmond grounds to
support the team. The cheering
and the singing will be a powerful
factor in determining the outcome.
The season can start light by mak
ing the Stanford support tomorrow
rellect credit.
