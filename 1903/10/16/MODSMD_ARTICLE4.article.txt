The Freshman squad has fin
ished its last hard practice. There
lias been a season of hard work
with many discouragements and
little to arouse confidence in the
minds of players or spectators.
But during the last two weeks a de
cided brace in the work of the
Freshmen culminated in their first
victory of the year, when Santa
Clara was defeated 12-0. At pres
ent everything points to a game
which will be hard fought, whether
it be a victory or a defeat.
Stanford bases her chances of
victory upon a set of good backs,
good ends, and a mastery by the
whole team of the simple forma
tions of football.
Head-Coach Lanagan has the fol
lowing to say about the game: "I
think the Stanford Freshmen have
an even break for the game. The
California team has been together
longer and its team work is un
doubtedly better. We have no in
dividual stars to equal Kern. It
is impossible to predict a score, but
I think the chances are even. The
Stanford Freshmen will play
straight football."
California's heavy line and smash
ing backs give her an advantage
that will probably be felt through
out the game. The Cardinal for
wards are light and there are at
least two places where they are de
cidedly weak. Assistant-Coach
Slaker appreciates this fact, and in
his forecast of the game he sums up

the situation as follows: "The
Freshmen have an even chance for
the game. I do not care to say
much about the prospects. Ourl
team may he a little weaker in the I
line, but the hack field will more
than make up for this."
Stanford is undoubtedly strong
est behind the line. Weller, at full
back, most nearly approaches the
man on the Stanford eleven who
can offset the advantage California
possesses in having a player of
Kern's superlative ability. Weller
is almost completely handicapped,
however, in that he is practically
without experience. His great
weight and strength will make him
a hard opponent, but in backing
up the line he is weak, and he has
a bad tendency to fumble. Stott,
at quarter, is a good field general
and has given evidence of his abil
ity to hold the team together. He
is good in running interference and
a safe man to play back. Dole and
Brennan, who complete the back
field, are of nearly equal merit.
Dole is perhaps the more finished
of the two and better learned in the
line points of the game, but Bren
nan is stronger on his feet and
smashes the line harder.
Morrow and Kelly, who will
play the ends, are both light men.
On defence they are both good and
each man uses his head well, but
Morrow is faster on his feet than
Kelly and seldom fails to beat him
down on punts. Butterfield at
tackle is the superior of True, and
is perhaps the best man in the line.
He is quick and heavy, but Steph
enson, who will play guard next
to him, should be able to hold his
own with his team-mate. Molfino
at center, and Shaner at left guard,
complete the eleven, but each man
is extremely light for a place in the
line.
As a whole the team plays to
gether well. The backs are strong,
the offensive play, except for fum
bling, good. It is in the line 011
defense that Stanford is weakest.
California opposes to the Freshman
team a heavier, more experienced
and versatile eleven. She appears
to have a variety of trick plays, a
good interference for Kern's dashes
around end, and a line capable of
holding well when hard pressed.
Freshmen games are always, of the
most uncertain order. The most
careful prognostications have been
so frequently overthrown that to
venture a guess as to the score is to
attempt the impossible. The 1907
eleven, however, appears to have a
good chance for victory. The men
are light and gritty, play well to
gether, are strong on offense and
not particularly weak on defense.
Unless the men lose their heads,
they can give California a hard
game by playing the straight foot
ball that Coaches Lanagan and
Slaker have been drilling into them.
Trainer Moulton has the follow
ing to say about the physical con
dition of the team: "I think
tomorrow's game will be a close
one. The Freshmen have had only
six weeks of practice. They also
have lacked the advantages of a
training-table. However, I feel
confident that they will enter the
game tomorrow in as good condi
tion as any Freshman team that
has represented Stanford. The in
juries received in the Santa Clara
team were slight and all the men
will be able to enter the contest
prepared to play the game of
their lives."
The following Stanford substi
tutes may enter the game: R. F.
West, end, weight 142; W. F. Der
by, end, weight 130; E. E. Jordan,
end; F. Zimmerman, guard, weight

tutes include Davis, end; Klein
schmidt, end, weight 165; Jones,
tackle, weight 175; Crow, half-back,
weight 160; Sanborn, half-back,
weight 155,
The officials for the contest have
been decided upon as follows:

player, will referee; J. T. Nourse,
Stanford'oo, and Kaarsburg, Cali
fornia '99, will alternateas umpire
and head linesman; W. H. Blake,

and has given evidence of his abil
ity to hold the team together. He
is good in running interference and
a safe man to play back. Dole and
Brennan, who complete the back
field, are of nearly equal merit.
Dole is perhaps the more finished
of the two and better learned in the
line points of the game, but Bren
nan is stronger on his feet and
smashes the line harder.
Morrow and Kelly, who will
play the ends, are both light men.
On defence they are both good and
each man uses his head well, but
Morrow is faster on his feet than
Kelly and seldom fails to beat him
down on punts. Butterfield at
tackle is the superior of True, and
is perhaps the best man in the line.
He is quick and heavy, but Steph
enson, who will play guard next
to him, should be able to hold his
own with his team-mate. Molfino
at center, and Shaner at left guard,
complete the eleven, but each man
is extremely light for a place in the
line.
As a whole the team plays to
gether well. The backs are strong,
the offensive play, except for fum
bling, good. It is in the line 011
defense that Stanford is weakest.
California opposes to the Freshman
team a heavier, more experienced
and versatile eleven. She appears
to have a variety of trick plays, a
good interference for Kern's dashes
around end, and a line capable of
holding well when hard pressed.
Freshmen games are always, of the
most uncertain order. The most
careful prognostications have been
so frequently overthrown that to
venture a guess as to the score is to
attempt the impossible. The 1907
eleven, however, appears to have a
good chance for victory. The men
are light and gritty, play well to
gether, are strong on offense and
not particularly weak on defense.
Unless the men lose their heads,
they can give California a hard
game by playing the straight foot
ball that Coaches Lanagan and
Slaker have been drilling into them.
Trainer Moulton has the follow
ing to say about the physical con
dition of the team: "I think
tomorrow's game will be a close
one. The Freshmen have had only
six weeks of practice. They also
have lacked the advantages of a
training-table. However, I feel
confident that they will enter the
game tomorrow in as good condi
tion as any Freshman team that
has represented Stanford. The in
juries received in the Santa Clara
team were slight and all the men
will be able to enter the contest
prepared to play the game of
their lives."

The Freshman squad has fin
ished its last hard practice. There
lias been a season of hard work
with many discouragements and
little to arouse confidence in the
minds of players or spectators.
But during the last two weeks a de
cided brace in the work of the
Freshmen culminated in their first
victory of the year, when Santa
Clara was defeated 12-0. At pres
ent everything points to a game
which will be hard fought, whether
it be a victory or a defeat.
Stanford bases her chances of
victory upon a set of good backs,
good ends, and a mastery by the
whole team of the simple forma
tions of football.
Head-Coach Lanagan has the fol
lowing to say about the game: "I
think the Stanford Freshmen have
an even break for the game. The
California team has been together
longer and its team work is un
doubtedly better. We have no in
dividual stars to equal Kern. It
is impossible to predict a score, but
I think the chances are even. The
Stanford Freshmen will play
straight football."
California's heavy line and smash
ing backs give her an advantage
that will probably be felt through
out the game. The Cardinal for
wards are light and there are at
least two places where they are de
cidedly weak. Assistant-Coach
Slaker appreciates this fact, and in
his forecast of the game he sums up

the situation as follows: "The
Freshmen have an even chance for
the game. I do not care to say
much about the prospects. Ourl
team may he a little weaker in the I
line, but the hack field will more
than make up for this."
Stanford is undoubtedly strong
est behind the line. Weller, at full
back, most nearly approaches the
man on the Stanford eleven who
can offset the advantage California
possesses in having a player of
Kern's superlative ability. Weller
is almost completely handicapped,
however, in that he is practically
without experience. His great
weight and strength will make him
a hard opponent, but in backing
up the line he is weak, and he has
a bad tendency to fumble. Stott,
at quarter, is a good field general
and has given evidence of his abil
ity to hold the team together. He
is good in running interference and
a safe man to play back. Dole and
Brennan, who complete the back
field, are of nearly equal merit.

The Freshman squad has fin
ished its last hard practice. There
lias been a season of hard work
with many discouragements and
little to arouse confidence in the
minds of players or spectators.
But during the last two weeks a de
cided brace in the work of the
Freshmen culminated in their first
victory of the year, when Santa
Clara was defeated 12-0. At pres
ent everything points to a game
which will be hard fought, whether
it be a victory or a defeat.
Stanford bases her chances of
victory upon a set of good backs,
good ends, and a mastery by the
whole team of the simple forma
tions of football.
Head-Coach Lanagan has the fol
lowing to say about the game: "I
think the Stanford Freshmen have
an even break for the game. The
California team has been together
longer and its team work is un
doubtedly better. We have no in
dividual stars to equal Kern. It
is impossible to predict a score, but
I think the chances are even. The
Stanford Freshmen will play
straight football."
California's heavy line and smash
ing backs give her an advantage
that will probably be felt through
out the game. The Cardinal for
wards are light and there are at
least two places where they are de
cidedly weak. Assistant-Coach
Slaker appreciates this fact, and in
his forecast of the game he sums up

the situation as follows: "The
Freshmen have an even chance for
the game. I do not care to say
much about the prospects. Ourl
team may he a little weaker in the I
line, but the hack field will more
than make up for this."
Stanford is undoubtedly strong
est behind the line. Weller, at full
back, most nearly approaches the
man on the Stanford eleven who
can offset the advantage California
possesses in having a player of
Kern's superlative ability. Weller
is almost completely handicapped,
however, in that he is practically
without experience. His great
weight and strength will make him
a hard opponent, but in backing
up the line he is weak, and he has
a bad tendency to fumble. Stott,
at quarter, is a good field general
and has given evidence of his abil
ity to hold the team together. He
is good in running interference and
a safe man to play back. Dole and
Brennan, who complete the back
field, are of nearly equal merit.
Dole is perhaps the more finished
of the two and better learned in the
line points of the game, but Bren
nan is stronger on his feet and
smashes the line harder.
Morrow and Kelly, who will
play the ends, are both light men.
On defence they are both good and
each man uses his head well, but
Morrow is faster on his feet than
Kelly and seldom fails to beat him
down on punts. Butterfield at
tackle is the superior of True, and
is perhaps the best man in the line.
He is quick and heavy, but Steph
enson, who will play guard next
to him, should be able to hold his
own with his team-mate. Molfino
at center, and Shaner at left guard,
complete the eleven, but each man
is extremely light for a place in the
line.
As a whole the team plays to
gether well. The backs are strong,
the offensive play, except for fum
bling, good. It is in the line 011
defense that Stanford is weakest.
California opposes to the Freshman
team a heavier, more experienced
and versatile eleven. She appears
to have a variety of trick plays, a
good interference for Kern's dashes
around end, and a line capable of
holding well when hard pressed.
Freshmen games are always, of the
most uncertain order. The most
careful prognostications have been
so frequently overthrown that to
venture a guess as to the score is to
attempt the impossible. The 1907
eleven, however, appears to have a
good chance for victory. The men
are light and gritty, play well to
gether, are strong on offense and
not particularly weak on defense.
Unless the men lose their heads,
they can give California a hard
game by playing the straight foot
ball that Coaches Lanagan and
Slaker have been drilling into them.
Trainer Moulton has the follow
ing to say about the physical con
dition of the team: "I think
tomorrow's game will be a close
one. The Freshmen have had only
six weeks of practice. They also
have lacked the advantages of a
training-table. However, I feel
confident that they will enter the
game tomorrow in as good condi
tion as any Freshman team that
has represented Stanford. The in
juries received in the Santa Clara
team were slight and all the men
will be able to enter the contest
prepared to play the game of
their lives."
