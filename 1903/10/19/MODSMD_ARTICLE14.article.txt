The University Inn has been
opened under a new management.
Whether or not it will be a perma
nent undertaking is largely depen
dent upon the support which the
men in Encina give it. There have
been several inefficient managers in
charge of the Inn during the re
cent poriod of its existence, but
the inconveniences that many of
the students have been forced to
undergo during the past month,
when there wa√ü no accessible eat
ing place for them, should be con
clusive enough reason that as many
as are able should take their meals
at the Inn and make it a perma
nent eating place.
