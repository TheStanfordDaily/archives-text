The Freshman team is to be con
gratulated for its admirable victory
over California. That they played
as the University believed they
would is evidenced by the score,
which does not completely show the
mastery of the game that they
exhibited. The result of the con
test cannot be taken as a surprise
by those who had been closely
watching the development of the
squad the past week. Honor must
go to the coaches, and to Trainer
Moulton, for a team hasseldom en
tered a game in better physical
condition. Ample testimony of
the merits of the present system of
strict training may be derived from
the results of the contest. The
players showed that they were per
fectly fitted to withstand the effects
of the hardest struggle.
