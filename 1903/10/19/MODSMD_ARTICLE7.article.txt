# STANFORD FRESHMEN WIN.
## California First-Year Eleven Defeated in Annual Contest by Score of Twelve to Nothing. 
### 
For the tenth time in the history
of the two colleges the Stanford
Freshmen have played the first
year men from California, and for
the sixth time the wearers of the
Cardinal have proven themselves
victorious. The first intercollegiate
contest of the year, which was
played on the Richmond grounds
in San Francisco last Saturday,
was a Stanford victory by a score
of 12 to 0. It is only doing justice
to the thirteen men who earned
1907 sweaters to say that as a team
and as individuals they showed a
complete superiority to their oppo
nents. Until near the end of the
second half, when the fierce strug
gle had begun to tell on the pay
ers, the Cardinal worked like a
machine. Every man was in
every play and every player fought
his hest until stopped by the ref
eree's whistle.
To Captain Stott the honor of
playing a perfect game must be
given. He handled his team with
the coolness and the insight of a
veteran, and his magnificent, dash
to a touchdown as the result of a
timely quarter-back trick earned
five points for Stanford. At full
back Weller was a tower of
strength; His line-bucks were
strong, so that time after time
California's line men were literally
carried off their feet by his heavy
dashes. But in backing up the
line it was that he showed to the
greatest advantage. Kern would
hit I he Stanford line and succeed
in finding a hole only to he stopped
by Weller and his mates in the
hack field. Through the whole
game, at guard on offense, at tackle
on defense, punting, and playing
in the backfield to run in punts,
Stephenson, who was too light to
play behind the line, called atten
tion to himself by his admirable
work. His fifty-yard run through
the whole California team promised
for a moment to materialize into
another touchdown, but he was
tackled while still twenty yards
from the goal.
Morrow and Kelly, and later
West, at ends, could not he passed
by the California backs. Brennan
was used for buck after buck until,
exhausted, he had to give way to
Packard. Dole proved himself a
worthy member of the family
which has played so prominent a
part in Stanford victories. Butter
field, True, Shaner, and Molfino
played hard, clean football, played
together, and came up from every
down fresh and ready for Captain
Stott's next signal.
Stanford's first touchdown was
made within the first six minutes
of play. Dole was forced past Sea
bury for a five-yard buck after the
Cardinal backfield had advanced
the ball forty yards by a series of
irresistible plunges against the
heavy California line. Stephenson
kicked off for Stanford and the ball
was run in ten yards. The eleven
California players jumped into a

quick formation and Kern started
around the end. Morrow and But
terfield broke up the interference
and the former threw the heavy
half-back for a loss of three yards.
Again the same play was tried and
again Morrow downed his man be
fore he had crossed the line of
scrimmage. Stanford had shown
that the play which had proved a
big factor in the preliminary
games of the State University was
to be held worthless in the inter
collegiate contest.
California punted to Stephenson,
who was downed on the fifty-yard
line. Stanford was given her first
chance to try the California line.
There was a feeling of surprise that
developed among the California
rooters to the deepest consternation
at the ease with which Weller and
Dole and Brennan tore through the
California line. Coach Lanagan
had said that his team would play
straight footbal.land the formations
were the most simple bucks be
tween guard and tackle. With
hardly a pause the ball was carried
to the five-yard line, where Weller
fumbled. Stott, like a Hash, was
on the ball, and on the next play
Dole was carried over the line.
The first six minutes of play had
been long enough for Stanford to
score in, to give witness to the
ability of the Cardinal backs to
dash through the California line,
and to show that the Stanford ends
could keep Kern from circling
them in his accustomed manner.
Kern kicked off over the goal
line and Stanford brought the ball
to the twenty-five yard line, where
Stephenson punted. After making
two attempts at straight bucks
Kern punted. The California line
was holding better and Stephenson
was called back to punt again.
California lost the ball on downs
and Molfino recovered the ball
twenty yards down the field on a
fumbled punt. California held
again and received the ball. She
tried two bucks over guard, and
Kern showed his possibilities by
hurling himself into the breach for
good gains. Kern was forced to
punt again. The Cardinal eleven
started another series of fierce
plunges against the line. Weller,
|)ole, and Brennan went through
the right side of the line, and But
terfield was hurled through for an
occasional cross-buck, but the ball
was fumbled on the four-yard line
and Kern punted out of danger.
Stott ran the ball in fifteen yards
before being downed, and then on
the first play Stott took the ball on
a quarter-back trick, dashed be
tween end and tackle, straight
armed the quarter-back, and
carried the ball square between
the goal-posts. It was done
done so quickly as to seem impos
sible. Dole sent the ball squarely
between the posts for the second
goal.
There was no more scoring done
