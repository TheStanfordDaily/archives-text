# "GIFTS OF CIVILIZATION."
## Subject of Sunday Morning Sermon by Chaplain Gardner in Memorial Church. 
### 
At the eleven o'clock service Sun
day, Chaplain Gardner preached
on "The Gifts of Civilization." He
pointed out the fundamental limi
tation of civilization. "By civili
zation we mean," said Dr. Gardner,
"all that trains and furnishes a
man for that civil state which is
his proper condition on this earth."
The preacher protested against the
popular mistrust of science, and
then proceeded to ask this question:
"Taking into view all that civiliza
tion stands for at its best —order,
liberty, justice, humanity —and all
that science has to offer of its
wealth of knowledge, do either, or
can both, satisfy the needs of hu
manity?" The preacher thought
not. lie advanced these doctrines
as specifically Christian and essen
tial to man's complete develop
ment, viz., man's spirituality and
immortality, man's relation to God,
the doctrine of brotherhood and re
ligion as the power to cure moral
evil.
The address in the afternoon was
on "Conscience, Its Function and
Education." Mr. Samuel Savan
nah played several selections on
the violin with organ accompani
ment.
