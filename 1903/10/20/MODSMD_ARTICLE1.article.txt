# MAY DEBATE WITH NEVADA.
## Indications Point to a Contest for the Stanford Second Team. 
### 
The University Debating Club
took action this afternoon favorable
to entering into an agreement with
the University of Nevada for a
debate with the second team. The
matter will now go before the Ex
ecutive Committee for approval,
and then will be acted on finally
by the Intercollegiate Debating
Committee.
During the semester letters have
been received from Pomona, the
University of Southern California,
and the University of Nevada, ex
pressing willingness to enter into
debating relations. Nevada was
chosen as a more logical rival, and
also because it is more accessible.
The reasons for dropping the
Washington debate are several, but
that of distance alone is the most
weighty. The long trip takes too
much time from the regular work,
is hard on the men, and is expen
sive.
