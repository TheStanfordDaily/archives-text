A debate for the second team
with the University of Nevada has
received the approval of the Uni
versity Debating Club, and upon
the acceptance by the Executive
Committee and the Intersociety
Debating League the contest will
approach a reality. Nevada has
been chosen in preference to other
universities for obvious reasons.
Such a debate will do a great deal
to stimulate interest in that line of
activity at Stanford. The present
field for distinction in intercol
legiate contests is too narrow
to offer any compensation to
those who do not make either
the Carnot team or the Stanford-
California team. A greater incen
tive for candidates appears when
additional contests are offered.
The opportunities that are held
out to those who are interested in
debating are liable to be too easily
overlooked by new men, especially
at this period when football is the
chief topic of conversation. The
advantages to be derived from par
ticipation in college debating are
practically unlimited. No one
should refrain from entering the
field through lack of experience.
Every Freshman who is inclined at
all toward debating ought to make
it a point to be present at the meet
ings of the Freshman Debating So
ciety. Those from the other classes
should identify themselves with
some one of the other societies the
moment the opportunity presents
itself. Debating occupies an en
viable position at Stanford and
those who participate gain large
returns.
