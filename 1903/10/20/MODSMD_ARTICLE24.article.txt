W. F. Dunn, '04, will be one of
the two representative* sent from
the Pacific Coast to the Olympian
games to be held next year under
the auspices of the Louisiana Pur
chase Exposition at St. Louis.
The other representative is G. R.
Abadie, of the University of Cali
fornia. Dunn holds the Coast re
cord for the quarter-mile, and Aba
die is a hundred-yard man.
This selection was made by the
Olympian Games Committee of the
Pacific Athletic Association, and at
the same time they declared the in
door championship meet, scheduled
to be held in Mechanics' Pavilion
this week, entirely off. Although
enough entries were received to
make the meet a success from
the standpoint of sport, the man
agement feared a deficit because of
counter attractions. In naming
Dunn and Abadie to represent this
Coast, they feel that they have
chosen the best athletes of this sec
tion in their respective events.
