Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The members of the Sophomore
class are extremely negligent in
regard to paying the small assess
ment levied some time ago to aid
in the presentation of the Sopho
more comedy. At the present time
there is hut a very small amount
of money in the treasury, and the
comedy committee is sadly in need
of funds to meet the necessary ex
penses and aid in carrying forward
the work. Every Sophomore should
feel it his duty to meet this small
obligation of but fifty cents at his
earliest convenience.
Treasurer 1906.
