# Classes in Outer Quad.
## 
### 
It is probable that the next two
or three weeks will see all the
classes of the Departments of His
tory, Economics, and English in
stalled in their new building in
the outer quad. It was originally
the intention to open up these
rooms at the beginning of the
semester, but the necessary chairs
failed to arrive from the East. The
seats are expected within the next
few days, and there will be little
delay in rearranging the class
room 112.
