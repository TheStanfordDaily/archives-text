# Freshman Debating Try-out.
## 
### 
According to present plans, the
try-out for the Freshman debating
team will be held the 28th and 29th
of October in the chapel. The
fact that twenty-eight men entered
makes it necessary to have the try
out on two evenings. A regulation
which was adopted by the Fresh
man Debating Society provides
that each speaker is to stay out of
the room until the beginning of the
speech of the one just preceding
him. This will give each man one
speaker to rebutt. The first speak
er for the affirmative may divide
his ten minutes, if he chooses, into
a first speech and a rebuttal. He
is to leave the room at the conclu
sion of his first speech, but is to
come back to hear the last negative
speaker, after which he is to give
his rebuttal. Ten minutes will be
allowed each man.
The judges of the try-out are Mr.
Bassett and Dr. Alden, of the Eng
lish department, and Professor
Lewers of the Law department.
