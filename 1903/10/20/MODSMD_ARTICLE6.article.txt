# The 						Metropolitan Orchestra.

### 
The Metropolitan Opera House
Orchestra, which will give a con
cert in Assembly Hall next Tues
day afternoon, is one of the most
evenly balanced instrumental bod
ies in the world. It has been
drilled in operatic as well as sym
phonic and other purely classic
music. Its reportoire is tremen
dous. The total number of musi
cians is about seventy, there being
fifteen first violinists alone.
J. S. Duss, the leader, was
formerly a capitalist in New Jersey,
but has always been a great mu
sical enthusiast. Not long ago he
withdrew from his immense busi
ness interests and determined to
devote his time and money to the
organizing and maintaining of this
orchestra.
Unlike other musical bodies, the
Metropolitan Orchestra does not
have to be organized every season,
hut its organization is kept intact
and its excellence maintained by
playing through the summer at
Madison Square Garden, New
York.
