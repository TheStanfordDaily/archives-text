# LAST NIGHT'S PRACTICE.
## Varsity Football Squad Increased by Seven of the Freshman Team. 
### 
With the addition of seven can
didates who played in the Fresh
man game the Varsity squad
is considerably increased and
strengthened. Weller, Stephenson,
G. E. Dole, Brennan, Molfino, But
terfield, and Stott are to continue
their practice. These men have so
increased the squad that two fair
ly strong second teams are now on
the field. Coach Lanagan had all
three teams running through form
ations last night. G. E. Dole,
Stephenson, Butterfield and Bren
nan are playing behind the line,
Stott at quarter, Molfino on the
line, and Weller at full-back.
Much of last night's work was
devoted to catching and running
down on punts and falling on the
ball. Weller was given special in
struction in catching punts and
holding the ball. Preston, M. P.
Hyde, and Sprott were put through
goal-kicking practice. The three
line-ups were intermingled with
Varsity certainties and possibili
ties, and from now on the big elev
en may be expected to gradually
assume the personnel that it will
have in the final contest.
Practice has now become of un
usual interest. With three fast
teams on the field at one time, the
prospect for lively practice games
are good. From the two second
teams an eleven can be chosen
easily that will make the Varsity
players work hard for their gains.
No scrimmage work was done last
night; and it is probable that heavy
practice will be held on about three
nights a week, as both coaches and
trainer are anxious not to overwork
the men.
