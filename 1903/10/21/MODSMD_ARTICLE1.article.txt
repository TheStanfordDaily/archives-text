# TO HAVE CLASS REGATTAS.
## Boating Club Decides Not to Enter Race with California and Washington. 
### 
The Stanford Boating Club met
last night for the tiißt time this se
mester. Owing to several obsta
cles it was decided not to consider
entering the proposed three
cornered race with California and
Washington next April.
It has been impossible as yet to
obtain any land on the slough
where a boat-house can be built.
Owing to the fact that a shell can
not be kept without a good boat
house. and that a large shell could
not be successfully used on Lagu
nita, it was deemed advisable to
postpone buying a shell until a
boat-house could be erected and
practice on the slough was possible.
Another difficulty which would
arise in practicing on the slough
at present is the bad condition of
the roads, making it impossible to
get to practice in the winter. In
the rainy season the road is llooded
with water, but by next fall it is
expected thecounty will better it.
Since an intercollegiate regatta
with California and Washington is
impossible for next spring, it was
decided to spend the money on
hand for interclass regattas on La
gunita. Two double-oared boats
will be bought and a contest be
tween the classes held next April.
Arrangements are to be made to
keep the water in Lagunita the
yearfaround.
A committee composed of Profes
sor A. W. Smith, Mr. S. S. reward,
Jr., J. M. Beach, '04, and H. B.
Kuhn, '04, which was appointed
last year, was given full power to
act in all matters without consult
ing the club members. The secre
tary's report showed the amount
of money on hand to be $375. The
sum may be raised to $425.
