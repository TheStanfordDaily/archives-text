# The
						French Club.

### 
The Cercle Francais met at the
Kappa Kappa Gamma house last
night. Following the custom in
augurated last year, it is holding
bi-weekly meetings for the double
purpose of acquiring a knowledge
of modern French literature and a
facility in speaking the French
language. By levying a monthly
assessment the club has been
enabled to build up a library of
modern French works in drama,
fiction, and poetry, with the inten
tion of supplementing the general
University Library, which contains
only the standard French writings.
At each meeting a review of some
book is presented by one of the
members of the organization, and a
general discussion follows. The
attention of the club last year was
given up wholly to the drama, but
this year's work will be confined to
fiction and poetry.
The membership is about fifteen.
The requirement for admission is
fluency in speaking French. Mr.
Colbert Searles, assistant professor
of Romanic Languages, is the pres
ident.
