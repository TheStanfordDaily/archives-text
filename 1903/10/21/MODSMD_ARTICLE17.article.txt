In bpite of the fact that football
is all important during the first
semester, there is little excuse for
the half-hearted response which
greeted Captain Ball's call for base
ball candidates to appear for fall
practice. After a series of disas
trous defeats on the diamond, Stan
ford finds herself forced to confront
next spring a veteran nine with a
team which must be developed al
most entirely from new material.
With such an unpromising out
look there is but one thing to do,
and that is for every man in
college who feels that he can in
any way aid in the development of
a Varsity football team to work
whole-heartedly with such an aim
in view. To do this, fall practice
is of much importance. There are
to be but two practices weekly, so
that the man who stays away
because he can not spare the time
will prove the exception.
