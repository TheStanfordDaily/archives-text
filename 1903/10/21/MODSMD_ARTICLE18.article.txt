Although no definite agreement
has been reached as to the seating
arrangements at the big game,
there is little likelihood that the
wishes of the undergraduates at
either California or Stanford will
be considered. The sentiment ever
since last year has been unanimous
against any repetition of the mis
erable arrangements then carried
out. The students, who are the
ones who should by all means be
given the best seats, were putin
one end of the bleachers. The
rival rooting sections, instead
of sitting on opposite sides of
the field, which is the logical ar
rangement in use at nearly every
university, were put on the same
side and as far away as possible, bo
that the effect of the cheering was
wholly lost. The plan of allowing
the people of San Francisco the
choicest seats is very good finan
cially, but when the two rooting
sections are so grouped as to make

an exciting spectacle for the great
body of San Francisco people who
are drawn to the game primarily
for this reason, objections will
surely arise. The students are the
mainstay of the team. It is they
who make the game a study, at
tend the daily practice, support
the team every minute, sing and
cheer whenever the occasion arises,
â€”then why shouldn't they be al
lowed the best seats at the big
game instead of the poorest? The
managers claim that the outsiders
pay more for their seats, which is
very true. However, it has not yet
been ascertained that the students
as a whole would object to a slight
increase. But the contention is
even stronger that monetary re
sources alone do not control the big
contest. Weightier considerations
should dictate. For above all, the
game is a University affair, and
the students are a big part of the
University.
