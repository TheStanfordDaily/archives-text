# FALL PRACTICE STARTS.
## Baseball Men Appear on the Diamond under Leadership of Cowden and Ball. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon, in response
to a call from R. B. Ball, captain
of the baseball nine, candidates for
the Varsity nine appeared on the
old diamond for fall practice.
There was a very small number of
men who putin an appearance, a
fact which was very noticeable
when it is remembered that Stan
ford will be obliged to develop
practically a new team to represent
her against California next spring.
None of the last year's Varsity
players putin an appearance ex
cept the captain and Cowden. The
latter will cooperate with Ball in
coaching the candidates during the
first semester's work.
The men were scattered over the
infield and in the outfield while
batting practice was being carried
on. The work was kept up until
dark. Such a small number of
men putin an appearance that it
was impossible to draw a line on
the comparative strength of the
new men. Captain Ball said that
he expected a large number of can
didates at the next practice, which
will be held on Thursday after
noon. The old Varsity men who
are in college, as well as the men
who earned class sweaters last year,
are expected to show up at that
time.
