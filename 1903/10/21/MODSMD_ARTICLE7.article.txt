# SECOND ELEVEN SCORES.
## Poor Showing Made by Varsity in Last Night's Practice. 
### 
Twenty minutes scrimmage work
In tit night constituted the first
line-up of the Varsity in four days.
The team work was loose and the
players seemed to be confused on
their signals. The backs on the
first eleven were slow in getting
into the plays. The whole team
seemed to have taken a slump.
Stephenson kicked off to the
Varsity, who were downed and
twice held without gain on their
twenty-five-yard line. The Var
sity was forced to punt and re
gained the hall on a fumble. They
finally succeeded in pushing M. P.
Hyde through right tackle and
sending him forty yards to the
goal line on a well guarded run.
Sprott failed to kick the goal.
The Varsity made the next kick
off and the Second eleven punted
on the second down. The punt
was returned by Hydeon first down
and the Second eleven again tried
to punt from their ten-vard line.
Sprott blocked the kick and But
terfiekl fell on the ball behind the
goal line, making a touchdown.
Hyde kicked the goal. Stephenson
kicked off to Tarpey and the Second
eleven got the ball on downs on
the Varsity's ten-yard line. A
tandem play through right tackle
miscarried and Monzingo got the
bill 1 over the Varsity goal line on
a fluke play. Stephenson was
successful on a try for goal.
The bleachers were well filled
last night, and song practice was
begun. The "Bum! Bum!" prize
song was repeated several times
with much success. The yell lead
ers urged all those attending prac
tices to bring their books, as
singing and yelling will take place
every afternoon.
