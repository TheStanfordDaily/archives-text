# HEAVY PRACTICE YESTERDAY.
## Nevada Coming Saturday for Most Important Preliminary Game of Season. 
### 
The hardest work for the Varsity
so far thin teason was done at
practice with the [Second team last
night. Following the usual pre
liminary practice a line-up of
nearly half an hour was taken up
with hard scrimmages. During
the first twenty minutes the Var
sity had little advantage. The
ball moved hack and forth between
the twenty-five-yard lines. Steph
enson gained some on the exchange
of punts, but the Varsity balanced
this on gains through the line,
until near the end of the game,
when the Varsity players took a
brace and managed to reach the
Second team's five-yard line. Here
the line of the Second eleven held
solid, requiring the Varsity to
make four bucks in order to force
the ball over the line for the only
score made.
Slaker had the Second team and
Lanagan the Varsity. Whenever
the Second eleven needed a yard or
two on last down, Slaker himself
would take Weller's piace and hit
the big line for the necessary gain.
Under Slaker's direction Weller is
improving gradually. He has not,
however, learned to go into the
linebucks running low.
The practice showed unusual
strength in the Second eleven and
hard fighting possibilities in the
big team. In a tierce scrimmage
Hauverman met with a painful
wrench of the ankle which may be
of sufficient seriousness to keep him
out of the big game. At any rate
the big center will not be able to
j> lay against Nevada Saturday.

The Nevada team, which will
play Saturday, may arrive Friday
afternoon. They will be accom
panied by their coach, Dr. A. C.
Steckle, a former tackle on the
Michigan varsity. Steckle has
coached Nevada for the past two
years. F. Smith, the captain, is
considered one of the strongest ends
on the Coast. He will play
end and will probably find more
than a match in Clark, who will
play against him in Saturday's
game. Freizell, who kicked the
field-goal by which Nevada scored
against Stanford last year, is at his
old position of full-back. Another
of Nevada's best players is Law
rence, right guard. Thompson will
be played against him, with a
slight advantage in weight. On
the whole the weight of the Nevada
team is somewhat greater than
Stanford's, but this will be over
come by more perfect formation
and faster team work.
