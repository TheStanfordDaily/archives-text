# METROPOLITAN ORCHESTRA.
## Company of Skilled Musicians to Appear in Assembly Hall Tuesday Afternoon. 
### 
The Metropolitan Opera House
Orchestra, which is to appear in
Assembly Hall on Tuesday af
ternoon, October 27th, under the
leadership of Mr. J. S. Dusb, is the
foremost organization of its kind
in the United [States. It has been
organized for many years for the
grand opera performances at the
Metropolitan Opera House in New
York City, and under the direction
of such conductors as Anton iSeid 1
and Walter Damrosch reached a
high degree of perfection. In con
cert work it is to be placed second
only to the famous Boston Sym
phony Orchestra.
Only recently, however, has it
been possible to hold the organiza
tion together during the summer
season. This lias become possible
largely through the energy of Mr.
Duss, the conductor. He lias al
ways been an enthusiastic student
of music, but circumstances forced
him into a financial career in his
earlier years. Later, having ac
cumulated a large fortune, he gave
up business pursuits and for sev
eral years has devoted himself en
tirely to music. During the last
summer he has conducted the Me
tropolitan Orchestra in one hun
dred and eighty concerts in New
York City, lor which work he has
been most highly praised.
Mrs. Katherine Fiske, contralto,
who appears here as soloist, has a
most enviable reputation as a
singer. Last winter she appeared
in fcian Francisco, where her sing
ing aroused great enthusiasm.
Mr. Nathan Franks, the violin
ist, has for many years been con
cert-master of the orchestra, and is
recognized as one of the greatest of
American violinists.
The program which will be given
Tuesday afternoon will be pub
lished in Monday's issue. It is to
be most attractive and will contain
among other things the symphonic
poem, "Don Juan," by Richard
Strauss, 'i bis was never performed
in America before the presentation
by this orchestra.
Aside from Stanford, the orches
tra appears only in San Francisco,
Oakland, Sacramento and Los An
geles.
This concert will be by all odds
the greatest musical event that has
ever taken place at the University.
The success or failure of this con
cert will be largely instrumental in
determining whether or not such
great attractions may be obtained
in the future.
