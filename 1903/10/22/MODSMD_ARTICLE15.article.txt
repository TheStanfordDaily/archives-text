The decision of the Boating Club
to hold class regattas next April
meets with general commendation.
Participation in the proposed three
cornered race with California and
Washington this year was naturally
deemed out of the question, but the
substitution of contests between the
classes will inaugurate the sport
and do much to arouse and main
tain interest in rowing at the Uni
versity. The present activity of
the Boating Club augurs well for
the auspicious beginning of a sport
that is destined to hold a front
rank in the calendar of athletic
events before many years have
passed. Ideal weather conditions
on this Coast make rowing an easy
and desirable matter. The ques
tion of starting this branch of col
lege activity at Stanford has been
discussed more or less for the last
eight years, and pleasure can well
be felt when its active inauguration
is seen to be at hand. Class regat
tas may be looked upon as power
ful factors in increasing class spirit.
In addition, opportunities for en
trance into University athletics
will be opened to many who are
unable to take part in the other
branches. The class contests will
be awaited with interest, for their
success is already assured.
