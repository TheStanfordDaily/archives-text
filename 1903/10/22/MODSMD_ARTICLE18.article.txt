Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In spite of all precautions taken
by the music committee to avoid
confusion, there seems to be con
siderable misunderstanding on the
part of the public as to the status
of the concert to be given by the
Metropolitan Opera House Orches
tra. This is not one of the cham
ber concert series. The chamber
concert programs, as stated at the
head of each subscription list cir
ulated, will consist of instrumental
trios, quartets, and perhaps quin
tets, in addition to numbers by
soloists. Committee.
