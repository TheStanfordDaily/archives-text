# Collection for Museum.
## 
### 
Last year it became generally
known that the Museum would be
glad to receive collections of curios
or relics from any student or grad
uate who were possessed of them. A
generous response was the result of
this announcement, and among
those who replied was Miss Irene
A. Wright. She has given to the
Museum a Mexican collection which
contains one or two especially fine
articles. Among the number a
carved cocoanut deserves particular
mention. The carving was done
by a prisoner at Santa Cruz who
devoted his time to this work in
order to earn money. The date in
all probability has been falsified, so
that the specimen is probably not
eo old as it appears to be. A
bisque rose from the memorial
wreath on the tomb of Juarez, situ
ated in the City of Mexico, is also
among the collection. It is a very
fragile and beautiful piece of work.
In addition to these there are in
the collection a number of idol
heads which are on sale through
out Mexico, some curious Mexican
playthings, a "milagro," or small
image given to Mexican saints in
exchange for favors granted to the
petitioners, and some insignia of
the Spanish army procured in
Puerto Rico.
