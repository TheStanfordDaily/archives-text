# TENNIS CLUB MEETS.
## Organization Discusses Plans for Work.—Much Interest Shown in the Sport. 
### 
Much business of interest was
transacted at the meeting of the
Tennis Club last night. C. H.
Baker,'o4, president of the organi
zation, opened the meeting and said
that at no time in the last four
years have tennis prospects ap
peared brighter than they do now.
The students are showing greater
interest in the sport, and the num
ber of players in the University is
large.
The club decided to admit as
members all men who intend to try
for the team. With this end in
view a meeting of those interested
in the sport has been called for
next week, and those who signify
an intention to try for the team
will become members of the club.
A tennis captain is to be elected,
and the club will become a tennis
squad. As the present courts are
inadequate for all the playerß who
wish to use them, the squad will
hold a series of tournaments to re
duce the number of players. The
best ten players thus selected will
use the new court. These players
will be classed according to their
skill, and a classed man will al
ways be subject to a challenge from
a player in the clasß below him.
This is the plan as roughly outlined
by the meeting last night, but it
may be considerably altered before
it is put into practice.
After some discussion it was de
cided to reserve the new court for
the use of the men students alone.
In case the old Encina courts are
repaired the women students will
he permitted to play there. The
student body treasurer spoke in re
gard to the proposed repairs on the
Encina courts. F. A. Lieb, '02, S. P.
Frisselle, '04, and B. S. Allen, '06,
were appointed a committee to in
vestigate the best means and prob
able cost of repairing the old courts.
This committee will report to the
treasurer.
