will soon purchase a boat for the
use of the girls' rowing crews.
Money has been raised through a
poster raffle and masquerade,which
netted $105.

offered by Dr. A. A. D'Anconna to
the member of the team making
the best showing during the season.
—The executive committee of
the associated students have decid
