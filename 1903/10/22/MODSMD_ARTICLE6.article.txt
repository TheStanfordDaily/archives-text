# Scenery for Faculty Comedy.
## 
### 
Arrangements are being made to
have special scenery brought down
from the city for the faculty com
edy, "A Scrap of Paper,'' to be
given in Assembly Hall November
6th. It has been found that the
scenery already here is not suffi
cient for the purposes of the play,
the scenes of which are laid in
French country houses. Meanwhile
the rehearsals are proceeding regu
larly, and there is every prospect
of full justice being done, both in
the acting and the stage presenta
tion, to the famous comedy that the
players have chosen for their Guild
Hospital benefit.
