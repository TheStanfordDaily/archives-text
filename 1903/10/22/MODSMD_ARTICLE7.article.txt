# Hospital Improvements.
## 
### 
Arrangements are being com
pleted for the furnishing and
equipment of the operating room
of the Guild hospital. This will
l>e done in a simple but serviceable
manner, so that the hospital staff
will be able to cope with any
emergency that may arise. There
are now four patients in the hospi
tal, which is about the average that
has been maintained since the be
ginning of the college year.
