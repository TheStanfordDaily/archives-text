# STANFORD VS. NEVADA.
## Tomorrow's Game Fifth Annual Contest Between the Two Univerities. 
### 
Stanford will meet the University
of Nevada in football for the fifth
annual contest tomorrow afternoon
at 3. Of the four previous games,
Stanford has won three and Nevada
one. Nevada began playing foot
ball six years ago, and since that
time, in an uphill struggle, has
developed a number of strong
players. In 1897 the Belmont
school defeated Nevada 74 to 0.
In 1898 a Stanford second eleven
was defeated by Nevada 22 to 0.
The following year Nevada had so
improved that she was able to score
on Stanford, and in 1900 defeated
the Cardinal 6 to 0.
This year the visiting team is
probably as strong as it has ever
been. The line-up shows a collec
tion of heavy men, and the hard
fights that Nevada has put up in
her games so far this year indicate
that a close contest may be looked
for tomorrow.
Conclusions drawn from the pre
liminary games of the season
prophesy a Cardinal victory. Ne
vada defeated Fort Baker 45 to 0,
while Stanford raised the figures to
57 to 0. Three weeks ago Stan
ford defeated the Reliance Athletic
Club 6 to 0. Two weeks later Re
liance, with practically the same
line-up that met Stanford, defeated
Nevada 11 to 5. Both of these
comparisons give Stanford the best,
of the outlook. While it is not
probable that Nevada can cross the
Cardinal goal-line, she still has a
fair chance to score if the ball can
be gotten within thirty yards of
tlie goal, for her left half-back,
Friesell, is rather accurate in kick
ing field-goals.
The teams will face each other
as follows:

The Varsity started this week
with a slump, probably due to the
fact that no line-up had been held
for four days. Since then a won
derful improvement has marked
the work, until last night saw the
best practice so far this season.
The offensive work of the team is
much better than its defense. The
men get off on the jump when
they have the ball, and the team
work is snappy. On the defense
the line ia not sure of holding.
Last night the Second eleven bucked
through for their yards three times.

The back-field is much stronger
than the line on both offense and
defense.
At left end Clark continues his
good work. Sprott is playing left
tackle in varsity style and may
now be considered a fixture.
Thompson is doing strong defen
sive work and is aggressive in
advancing the ball and making
holes. Hauverman's ankle is troub
ling him considerably. There is,
however, little likelihood of his
being kept out of the big contest
His place will be filled tomorrow
by Nissen, a player with the weight
but not the efficiency of Hauver
man. C. E. Hyde seems to be
ahead of the other candidates for
right guard, but he does not fill
the place in real varsity form.
Shields will play right tackle and
will probably be replaced by Mon
zingo in the second half. Stillman
can not play tomorrow on account
of illness. His knowledge of the
game will in all probability out
weigh the greater strength of
Shields when it conies to choosing
the final line-up to meet California.
Right end will be played tomor
row by Preston. Smith and Preston
are making a hard fight for this
position, but the recent effective
goal-kicking of Preston may win
him the place. W. Dole continues
to do line work at right half.
Weller, Scholfield, and Chalmers
are having a close race for full
back. If Weller develops true
bucking form, his strength will
give him the position. If he does
not, the race lies between Chalmers
and Scholfield. Chalmers is a
player of experience, and at pres
ent is probably the strongest line
bucker on the field. Hyde and
Tarpey are in an even race for left
half-back. In case Weller makes
full-back, Chalmers will stand a
good chance to go in at left half.
The next three important varsity
games after tomorrow will be
played on the campus as follows:
Chemawa Indians, October 28th;
Reliance Athletic Club, October
31st; and Multnomah Athletic
Club, November 7th.

vada defeated Fort Baker 45 to 0,
while Stanford raised the figures to
57 to 0. Three weeks ago Stan
ford defeated the Reliance Athletic
Club 6 to 0. Two weeks later Re
liance, with practically the same
line-up that met Stanford, defeated
Nevada 11 to 5. Both of these
comparisons give Stanford the best,
of the outlook. While it is not
probable that Nevada can cross the
Cardinal goal-line, she still has a
fair chance to score if the ball can
be gotten within thirty yards of
tlie goal, for her left half-back,
Friesell, is rather accurate in kick
ing field-goals.
The teams will face each other
as follows:

The Varsity started this week
with a slump, probably due to the
fact that no line-up had been held
for four days. Since then a won
derful improvement has marked
the work, until last night saw the
best practice so far this season.
The offensive work of the team is
much better than its defense. The
men get off on the jump when
they have the ball, and the team
work is snappy. On the defense
the line ia not sure of holding.
Last night the Second eleven bucked
through for their yards three times.

The back-field is much stronger
than the line on both offense and
defense.
At left end Clark continues his
good work. Sprott is playing left
tackle in varsity style and may
now be considered a fixture.
Thompson is doing strong defen
sive work and is aggressive in
advancing the ball and making
holes. Hauverman's ankle is troub
ling him considerably. There is,
however, little likelihood of his
being kept out of the big contest
His place will be filled tomorrow
by Nissen, a player with the weight
but not the efficiency of Hauver
man. C. E. Hyde seems to be
ahead of the other candidates for
right guard, but he does not fill
the place in real varsity form.
Shields will play right tackle and
will probably be replaced by Mon
zingo in the second half. Stillman
can not play tomorrow on account
of illness. His knowledge of the
game will in all probability out
weigh the greater strength of
Shields when it conies to choosing
the final line-up to meet California.
Right end will be played tomor
row by Preston. Smith and Preston
are making a hard fight for this
position, but the recent effective
goal-kicking of Preston may win
him the place. W. Dole continues
to do line work at right half.
Weller, Scholfield, and Chalmers
are having a close race for full
back. If Weller develops true
bucking form, his strength will
give him the position. If he does
not, the race lies between Chalmers
and Scholfield. Chalmers is a
player of experience, and at pres
ent is probably the strongest line
bucker on the field. Hyde and
Tarpey are in an even race for left
half-back. In case Weller makes
full-back, Chalmers will stand a
good chance to go in at left half.
The next three important varsity
games after tomorrow will be
played on the campus as follows:
Chemawa Indians, October 28th;
Reliance Athletic Club, October
31st; and Multnomah Athletic
Club, November 7th.
Stanford will meet the University
of Nevada in football for the fifth
annual contest tomorrow afternoon
at 3. Of the four previous games,
Stanford has won three and Nevada
one. Nevada began playing foot
ball six years ago, and since that
time, in an uphill struggle, has
developed a number of strong
players. In 1897 the Belmont
school defeated Nevada 74 to 0.
In 1898 a Stanford second eleven
was defeated by Nevada 22 to 0.
The following year Nevada had so
improved that she was able to score
on Stanford, and in 1900 defeated
the Cardinal 6 to 0.
This year the visiting team is
probably as strong as it has ever
been. The line-up shows a collec
tion of heavy men, and the hard
fights that Nevada has put up in
her games so far this year indicate
that a close contest may be looked
for tomorrow.
Conclusions drawn from the pre
liminary games of the season
prophesy a Cardinal victory. Ne
vada defeated Fort Baker 45 to 0,
while Stanford raised the figures to
57 to 0. Three weeks ago Stan
ford defeated the Reliance Athletic
Club 6 to 0. Two weeks later Re
liance, with practically the same
