Stanford meets the University
of Nevada in football tomorrow for
the fifth annual game. This contest
is the most importantof the prelimi
nary games, and from it much can
be drawn as to the probable out
come of the intercollegiate match
with California, as the State Uni
versity will meet the Nevada eleven
next week. Intercollegiate rela
tions with the University of Nevada
are being broadened yearly, and
the establishing of debating con
tests this year opens up possibili
ties for mutual participation in
other branches that will be of great
good to both institutions. The
annual football game brings the
students of Nevada and Stanford
closer together and strengthens the
amicable relations that exist. We
look for a Stanford victory, but in
the visitors the Cardinal has an
opponent whom it has reason to
regard with fear. The yelling and
singing tomorrow ought to be the
best of the year. With the big
game but three weeks off the char
acter of student support should
reach a degree of perfection.
