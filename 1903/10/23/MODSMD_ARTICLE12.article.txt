# SEATS FOR GAME.
## Treasurer Cowden Arranges With Manager Decoto for Handling Spectators. 
### 
The selection of the blocks of
seats which will be distributed
among the rooters of California and
Stanford has been definitely made.
It had been the object of both man
agers to have the rooting sections
on opposite sides of the field, but
owing to the fact that the covered
seats are more expensive it was
found necessary to seat the rooters
of both colleges on the same side
of the field. The sections for the
students will be the third from
each end. Stanford will change
places with California this year.
The arrangement places the stu
dents slightly nearer the center of
the bleachers. Each college will
be given as many seats as the
students may demand.
Seats will be reserved for the
alumni of the colleges this year for
the first time. Fifteen hundred
seats are in the hands of Col.
Edwards of California, who will
have charge of the distribution of
seats among the alumni of the
state university, and five hundred
tickets will be given out by J. T.
Noiirse, '00, to the Stanford alumni.
These seats are the best on the
field and will be taken from those
formerly reserved for the Univer
sity Club of San Francisco. Only
three blocks of 1500 seats, instead
of five blocks of 2500, as in former
years,will be placed at the disposal
of that organization.
There will be about 10,000 tickets
for reserved seats at the game this
year in addition t04,000 admissions
to standing room. If the demand
is great enough, additional bleach
ers will be erected at the end of
the field.
The tickets for the game and
Fischer's theater will be placed on
sale sometime during the next
week. Rooter's tickets will be
$1.50. The price for the theater
tickets has not been decided upon.
