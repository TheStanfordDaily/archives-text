# SPEAKS ON EASTERN QUESTION.
## Jerome Lanfield of the University of California Lectures in Chapel. 
### 
Jerome B. Lanfield, instructor
in the history department of the
University of California, lectured in
the chapel this afternoon on the
Macedonian question. Lanfield
spent last summer abroad, and
made a thorough study of the ques
tion that is now absorbing the at
tention of Europe. He said that
the newspaper accounts serve sim
ply to confuse the issue, which is a
very complicated one. Macedonia
practically consists of the three
vilayets of Turkey, known as Kos
soro, Monastir, and Salonica. The
vilayets of Scutari and Yanina are
inhabited by Albanians, devoted
followers of the Sultan. The in
habitants of the country number
about 2,000,000, so diversified in
race that any classification is diffi
cult. One third, or about 800,000,-
are agricultural Turks, and the
greater part of the remainder
Slavs.
"The Turkish government and
the people themselves must be kept
separate," Lanfield said. "We
must not confuse the administra
tion of the governors and that part
of the population which is purely
Turkish. No administration could
be much worse. Little attempt is
made to carry out the principles of
justice. At times the ruling power
at Constantinople has been progres
sive and able, and its administra
tion has been admirable. At present
palace favorites are sent out to
make their fortunes. They sell
justice. They levy every tax that
is possible and collect taxes as often
as possible."
Autonomy in Macedonia, Lan
field stated, would simply mean
giving the worst element in the
country, the so-called Christians,
license to annihilate the weaker ele- j
ment. He told of the contest be-j
tween Servia and Bulgaria for!
predominating influence in the)
peninsula, and then spoke of the j
aims of Russia. Russia regards i
the attainment of Constantinople]
as her aim, and it is her policy to
maintain the integrity of the Sul
tan's empire until the moment
when it will be possible for her to
grasp that portion of it which she
desires. At present the Slavs
would fight the Russian rule, and
recognizing this, Russia is content
to await her opportunity.
