It is to be regretted that the
concert to he given by the Metro
politan Orchestra Tuesday after
noon is meeting with such meager
attention by the students. Few
evidently realize the excellence of
the entertainment that the faculty
music committee has provided.
Upon the success or failure of this
concert will depend largely the
outcome of the entire series of mu
sical events already planned for
the University. Stanford gets none
too many of good attractions, any
way, but when the best obtainable
come the students ought to lend
their entire support.
