## Visiting Team Out-plays the Cardinal in Every Branch of Game. 
### 
Saturday's game between Stan
ford and Nevada was a bitter dis
appointment to the one thousand
Cardinal supporters who attended
with the expectation of seeing a
Stanford victory by a fair score.
The fact that there was no score
gives the ad vantage of the contest
to Nevada, whose football prepara
tion is carried on against extremely
adverse conditions. At the begin
ning of the battle Nevada hurled
her backs against the left side of
the Stanford line, which she soon
found to be impregnable. The
right side was then tried, and there
was found the weak resistance that
was continually hit during the
remainder of the game. At center
Nissen played a careless game. His
passing was the caiise of most of
the fumbling, and on the only trial
that Stanford made for a field-goal
he so passed the ball that the at
tempt was impossible. Between
right guard and center and between
right guard and tackle the Stanford
line was very weak. The back
field did little better than the line.
Chalmers made one or two valu
able gains. Hyde and Tarpey
were both thrown back several
times and made no considerable
gains. Weller played to good
advantage in advancing the ball.
He also did effective work in
smashing through, but the slowness
of the other backs to follow his in
terference made his work of little
consequence. Sprott played a good
defensive game and did some very
successful kick-blocking. Clark
also played good football.
Nevada clearly out-played the
Cardinal team. On the defensive
the Nevada back-field reinforced
the line in admirable manner and
time after time held Stanford on
downs. In advancing the ball
from the scrimmage-line Nevada
backs covered fifty-two yards more
than the Cardinal runners. Al
though everyone of the visitors
played in fair form, the men who
did most to make the game a tie
were Captain Smith, Freieell, and
I. Steckle.
Sprott made the first kick-off for
Stanford and sent the ball to the
line, from where it was run in
twenty yards. Nevada made her
yards on two cross-bucks through
right tackle. The Cardinal line
held solidly the next few bucks,
and Stanford got the ball on
downs. Stanford made yards on
two cross-bucks through the right
of the Nevada line, and did it again
on three bucks through center.
Hyde went around left end for two
yards, and the outcome looked
favorable, as the Nevada team was
being gradually forced nearer its
goal-line. Hut on the next play
Tarpey was thrown back for a loss.
This was followed by a fumble by
Nissen. Nevada got the ball and
started off with a ten-yard gain by
a fake-kick play. Twice the visit
ors bucked the Stanford line for the
required yards and then lost the
ball on downs. Chalmers advanced
the ball twenty-seven yards by
breaking through right tackle on a

cross-buck. Hyde made five more
on a long end-run, and then Nevada
held on downs. Nevada made
yards once and was forced to punt.
Hansbach made a fair catch, and
Hyde kicked thirty-five yards.
Nevada got yards once more before!
time was called on the first half.
The second half was a repetition
of the first, with the difference that
the ball was kept in Stanford terri
tory. Nissen caused the team to
be penalized five yards by interfer
ence with center. The Cardinal
line was even weaker in the second
half than in the first, and when it
came to advancing the ball few
gains were made on Nevada.
The game was clean and free
from accidents. No player was
changed on account of injuries.

found to be impregnable. The
right side was then tried, and there
was found the weak resistance that
was continually hit during the
remainder of the game. At center
Nissen played a careless game. His
passing was the caiise of most of
the fumbling, and on the only trial
that Stanford made for a field-goal
he so passed the ball that the at
tempt was impossible. Between
right guard and center and between
right guard and tackle the Stanford
line was very weak. The back
field did little better than the line.
Chalmers made one or two valu
able gains. Hyde and Tarpey
were both thrown back several
times and made no considerable
gains. Weller played to good
advantage in advancing the ball.
He also did effective work in
smashing through, but the slowness
of the other backs to follow his in
terference made his work of little
consequence. Sprott played a good
defensive game and did some very
successful kick-blocking. Clark
also played good football.
Nevada clearly out-played the
Cardinal team. On the defensive
the Nevada back-field reinforced
the line in admirable manner and
time after time held Stanford on
downs. In advancing the ball
from the scrimmage-line Nevada
backs covered fifty-two yards more
than the Cardinal runners. Al
though everyone of the visitors
played in fair form, the men who
did most to make the game a tie
were Captain Smith, Freieell, and
I. Steckle.
Sprott made the first kick-off for
Stanford and sent the ball to the
line, from where it was run in
twenty yards. Nevada made her
yards on two cross-bucks through
right tackle. The Cardinal line
held solidly the next few bucks,
and Stanford got the ball on
downs. Stanford made yards on
two cross-bucks through the right
of the Nevada line, and did it again
on three bucks through center.
Hyde went around left end for two
yards, and the outcome looked
favorable, as the Nevada team was
being gradually forced nearer its
goal-line. Hut on the next play
Tarpey was thrown back for a loss.
This was followed by a fumble by
Nissen. Nevada got the ball and
started off with a ten-yard gain by
a fake-kick play. Twice the visit
ors bucked the Stanford line for the
required yards and then lost the
ball on downs. Chalmers advanced
the ball twenty-seven yards by
breaking through right tackle on a

cross-buck. Hyde made five more
on a long end-run, and then Nevada
held on downs. Nevada made
yards once and was forced to punt.
Hansbach made a fair catch, and
Hyde kicked thirty-five yards.
Nevada got yards once more before!
time was called on the first half.
The second half was a repetition
of the first, with the difference that
the ball was kept in Stanford terri
tory. Nissen caused the team to
be penalized five yards by interfer
ence with center. The Cardinal
line was even weaker in the second
half than in the first, and when it
came to advancing the ball few
gains were made on Nevada.
The game was clean and free
from accidents. No player was
changed on account of injuries.
