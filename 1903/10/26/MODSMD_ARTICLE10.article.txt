# RECOMMEND CHANGES.
## Faculty Athletic Committees Want Big Game on California Grounds Next Year. 
### 
At a joint meeting of the faculty
athletic committees of the Univer
sity of California and Stanford
University held at the University
Club in San Francisco last Satur
day a number of important mo
tions were made regarding the
athletic activities of the two Uni
versities. The recommendations of
the committees are purely advis
ory .and will be submitted to the
intercollegiate committees at their
next joint meeting in January.
The chairmen of the faculty com
mittees are Dr. Frank Angell for
Stanford, and Col. Edwards for the
University of California.
The committee decided to recom
mend the maintainance of the pro
vision in the intercollegiate agree
ment providing that the intercol
legiate football games should be
held upon the college grounds, be
ginning in 1904. This provision
was inserted in the intercollegiate
agreement at the request of Stan
ford. California has expressed its
approval, and it will be recom
mended by the faculty committee
that it be adhered to hereafter.
Next year's game will be played on
the California grounds at Berkeley,
It was proposed that the Fresh
man football contest be made the
best two out of three, and that the
games be played in February. It
was suggested that the Freshman
players are in the way when the
coaches should have the Varsity
men in hand, and it was believed
that the freshmen should beallowed
to get through their first semester's
work without giving up the time
required by football practice.
The committee recommended the
wearing of distinctive uniforms in
all football games, because of the
confusion produced in the minds of
spectators by the similarity of cos
tumes at the last Stanford-Califor
nia Freshman game.
The committee also decided to
recommend that freshman baseball
and track contests be added to the
list of intercollegiate events. This
recommendation was favored be
cause it was believed that freshman
intercollegiate contests would bring
out a greater quantity of new
material, which under the present
| conditions is very slow in coming
out.
