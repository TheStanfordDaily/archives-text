A defeat is always a disappoint
ment, and especially so when it
comes in the nature of a surprise.
Saturday's game was not a victory
for Nevada as far as the score is
concerned, but in every other way
it was. To the visiting team a
great deal of glory must go. It
played such football as has not
been seen on the campus for some
years, and it did it in such a clean
and sportsmanlike manner as to
elicit praise from every spectator.
Stanford men were quite unpre
pared to see their eleven play such
a ragged game. Although the Un
iversity's confidence in any team
that wears the Cardinal will never
diminish, nevertheless a repetition
of Saturday's exhibition is not go
ing to strengthen that feeling of
faith that every Stanford man re
poses in the team. The careless,
indifferent, and sluggish playing
may be called a slump, but the
time for these things is past. De
claring the contest inconsequential
does not remove the odium of de
feat. Nevada is a rival we may
well be proud to meet, and if the
annual game is to be regarded in
differently because of the greater
match with California, it would be
better that the schedule omit the
Nevada team. It does Stanford
little good to make a poor showing
when everybody knows that a vic
tory ought to have been won. The
eleven would have defeated Nevada
had it played as it is able to and as
the University expected it would.
The big game is scarcely three
weeks away, and every Stanford
man knows and feels that from
now on the team is going to disc ml
its lethargy and indifference and
do the kind of work that it is capa
ble of. There is something radi
cally wrong with the yelling. Sat
urday's cheering was the poorest of
the season. The blame rests on
the students themselves, for the
efficiency of the leaders is conceded

The miserable and half-hearted
rooting is due entirely to the indif
ference of a few who persistently
refuse to respond to the yell lead
ers. With nearly four hundred
men students in the cheering sec
tion, the showing did not do credit
to a fourth of that number. An
improvement may be looked for in
Wednesday's contest with the
Chemawa Indians.
