Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Judging from the small advance
sale of seats one would conclude
that the community does not realize
the great treat that is in store for
it tomorrow afternoon. When
the music committee first broached
the matter of obtaining the Metro
politan Opera House Orchestra for
a concert here, a guarantee of four
teen hundred dollars was asked.
However, when it was pointed out
that Stanford had in the past given
good support to good concerts, the
management finally agreed to come
down on their own responsibility,
and the committee offered to do all
ihat it could to make the affair a
success. These great organizations
enjoy playing before university
audiences because they expect to
find them appreciative of good
music. A concert of this sort is a
thing that can hardly be hoped
for once in three or four years in a
community so far removed from a
great city, and it seems as though
the most cordial support should
be given to the undertaking. If,
however, as now seems more or less
probable, only meager support is
given, it will mean that in the
future only less desirable, and
therefore cheaper attractions can
be handled here. The Metropoli
tan Opera House Orchestra, besides
being about the best orchestra in
the country, is also one of the most
expensive to run, and this is in
general -true of all of the better
things. Of course there is abso
lutely no reason why any one not
interested in th'e best music to be
had should pay his money to go
to concerts, but the committee has
been working under the impression
that there were a great many
among us who desired to know
something of good music, and that
such an opportunity as (his would
be welcomed. If this is not the
case it is a matter for regret, and
will of course mean that our com
munity must continue to live
along without the possibility of
hearing such grand concerts as the
one of tomorrow will be.
