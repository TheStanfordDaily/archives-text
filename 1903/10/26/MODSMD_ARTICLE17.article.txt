Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I notice that the Stanford and
California rooting sections at the
big game are to he placed in the
former unsatisfactory way on the
same side of the field. There is
little doubt hut that the majority
of the students of both univer
sities are in favor of having the
two sections sit opposite each other,
and the desirability of such an
arrangement is too obvious to need
discussion. The game is strictly a
student affair, and the idea that the
middle seats should he held for out
siders who will pay more for them
does not seem sufficient reason for
disregarding the students' senti
ments unless the game is to be
regarded as purely a money-making
enterprise. Even if looked at from
this standpoint it must be remem
bered that most of the people from
San Francisco go as much to enjoy
the rooting as the football playing,
and there is no doubt but that the
former would be rendered much
more effective by having the two
sections placed opposite each other.
