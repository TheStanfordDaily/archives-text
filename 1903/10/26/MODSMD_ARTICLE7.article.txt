the story. This form of composi
tion has for the most part devel
oped since the time of Richard
Wagner, and very largely through
the use of the innovations in
orchestration which he introduced.
Richard Strauss, in addition to
j being one of the most scholarly
; composers of the times, is recog
j nized as the greatest master of this
; musical form.

| composition based upon American
I Indian music, and is of great inter-
I est to an American audience. The
