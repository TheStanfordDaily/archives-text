# Collegiate Alumnae Home.

### 
A year ago a plan was announced
by the California branch of the
Association of Collegiate Alumnae
to establish a club-house in San
Francisco to accommodate the
graduates of women's colleges and
undergraduate transients in the
city. Since that time the Associa
tion has considered plans proposed
by several women's clubs of San
Francisco for a joint occupancy of
a club-house, but all these have
been rejected. A tea-room was
opened last December as a tempo
rary measure, but that has been
abandoned. It is now thought that
the establishment of a club-house
at present would be inexpedient,
but the matter of reopening the
tea-room will be decided by a meet
ing of the Association in San Fran
cisco next Saturday.
The Association of College Alum
nae is a national organization
largely social in purpose. Eight
meetings a year are held for the
general renewal of friendships, and
for the discussion of matters of
active interest to women. Its mem
bership is representative of twenty
two colleges.
