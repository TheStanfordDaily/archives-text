Thk matter of class pins will
bear the thoughtful attention of
the Seniors. A perfectly appropri
ate and satisfactory plan suggested
by the committee seems to meet
with the approval of quite a few of
the members of the class. Since
the design of the University seal
chosen by 1903 is highly in keep
ing with the traditions of the Uni
versity, the Seniors cannot err by
doing their share toward making it
a distinctive pin to be used by all
graduating classes.
