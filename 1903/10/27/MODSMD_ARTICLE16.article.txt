The cheering at the intercollegi
ate game can be greatly improved
by a judicious readjustment in the
distribution of tickets. Although
the rule forbidding seats in the
rooting section to those not wear
ing red hats is tacitly enforced,
many who wear the hats but do not
yell gain entrance to these places.
Last year each person was allowed
to buy ten tickets, and these were
as generally used by friends of the
students as by the students them
selves. This arrangement does
great injury to the cheering by dis
tributing here and there through
the rooting section persons who go
to the contest for the spectacle and
who will not yell. The plan that
is to be employed at the Yale-
Harvard game is to sell to each
student but one ticket to the root
ing section. To make it binding
that the person who buys the ticket
uses it, the men are seated in
classes. The [latter scheme cannot
very well be started here, but by
allowing each student to buy but
one ticket in the rooting section
there will be a reasonable surety
that the cheering will be a great
deal more satisfactory. The objec
tion will rise that every student
cannot spare the time to stand in
line, and that convenience results
from allowing one person to pur
chase ten seats. This difficulty
can be obviated easily by allowing

each student to sign application
blanks and then allotting |the seats i
in the order the blanks are filed
with the treasurer. The distribu
tion of tickets can go on conven
iently and easily, as a great rush
for choice seatß will be done away
with by the allotting system. No
trouble has heretofore resulted at
the annual game from tickets fall
ing into the hands of speculators,
but the tempting loophole held out
to this class of people when ten
tickets are sold to one man is con
fessedly a matter to receive the
cautious attention of the respective
treasurers of California and Stan
ford.
