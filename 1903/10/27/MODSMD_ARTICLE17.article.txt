At the Sunday morning service
in Memorial Church Rev. C. M.
Hill of Oakland preached on the
subject, "The Study of the Great
Book." He chose as his text, "Is
it not for this that ye err, that ye
know not the scriptures, nor the
power of God?" Dr. Hill began
his sermon by speaking of the
greatness of the Bible and of its
enduring popularity. He said in
part:
"We speak of the Bible as The
Book, with none other of all the
books of the world as worthy of
being classed with it. Let facts
speak of the greatness of the Bible.
There is the fact of its popularity.
In this respect alone it is a literary
wonder. Its greatness is attested
also by its influence, by the fact
that it endures, by the fact that it
is the exhaustless book. And while
it may be said, perhaps, that
knowledge of the Bible is more wide
spread than knowledge of any
other book, there is the best of
reason for believing that in our
land and day there is an alarming
ignorance of the Bible among those
who might be supposed to be in
structed in it."
After lamenting the indifference
of the so-called educated classes in
this respect, Rev. Hill urged a
deeper study of the Bible, particu
larly because in it can be found
the secret of good character.
At the afternoon service Chaplain
Gardner gave a short address on
"Religion." Mr. Louis Eaton, or
ganist of Trinity Church, San
Francisco, gave an unusually bril
liant organ recital.
