Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Although not definitely decided,
the Senior pin committee thinks it
advisable to adopt the University
seal as a design, the same that was
used by the Senior class of last
year. It is hoped that if 1903 and
1904 set the precedent of using the
seal, other classes will follow, and
the Senior pin will become an
emblem of graduation that will be
recognized everywhere. Thus, Stan
ford men may meet in different
parts of the world and know each
other by the pin which every Stan
ford graduate ought to wear. There
is one great objection in adopting
the University seal. It is not an
artistic design for a pin. Other
things were suggested and designs
drawn, but nothing that seemed to
be as representative of Stanford as
the seal. A slightchange or addition
to the design might be made to
make it of a more artistic nature,
but the objection comes that if
1904 tampers with the original,
other classes may do the same, and
the object in ndopting the seal
would be defeated. The pin of
last year was covered with red
enamel, which makes a very cheap
looking one, and also a pin that
will not wear. As an experiment
the committee is now having one
made of plain gold. The pin ex
actly as used last year, with the
numerals changed, can be seen at
the Bookstore. The opinion of
quite a number of Seniors has
already been sounded. Suggestions
or objections will be gladly received
by the committee before a decision
is reached. G. Cromwell,
A. G. Crank,
Committee.
