# INDIANS PLAY TOMORROW.
## Stanford Varsity Will Meet Chemawa Football Team for First Time. 
### 
The Chemawa Indians from the
government reservation school near
Salem, Oregon, will play the Var
sity tomorrow at 4 for the first
time. Before the California var
sity ran up a forty to nothing score
on the Indians last Saturday it was
thought that the visiting team
would put up a fairly hard strug
gle. From the result of that game
it would appear that Stanford will
not have a difficult contest.
The Chemawa team is light but
fast. With the exception of Saun
ders and Schildt, there are no men
on the team who weigh over one
hundred and sixty-five pounds.
Schildt is a former Carlisle tackle
and at present is an instructor in
the Chemawa school. He is coach
of the eleven and the most formid
able player on the line. Saunders
is the all-round star of the squad.
He has played fullback for several
years. His line-bucking ability is
spectacular, and though of compar
atively little avail against the
heavy California line, it will prob
ably be more effective against the
lighter Cardinal line. Among
the players are two white
men who are instructors in the
school. The game is called for
four o'clock.
The following will be the line-up:

As a result of the poor showing
made by the Varsity in the Nevada
game, there was some rearranging
of the big eleven by Coach Lana
gan at last night's practice. Hau
verman is again at center, but will
hardly be well enough to go into
the game with the Indians. W.H.
Dole is also in the line-up again.
He did some successful drop-kicking
last night.
At the right of center last night
was Van Sickle, at guard in place
of Hyde, who was transferred to
the Second eleven. Shields went
in at right tackle in place of Still
man, who was sent to the Second
team. Weller is again laid up in
l>ed with blood-poisoning on the
knee, and will be out of the prac
tice for at least a few days. This
means a good deal for him at the
present time, as he needs the prac
tice more than any other player on
the team. Scholfield played full
and Chalmers right-half. No
scrimmage work was carried on.
Almost the entire evening was
devoted to a line-up of the teams
for place-kicks and punts. In
catching the ball and running in

kicks some exceptionally clever
work was done by Stott and Steph
enson. Stephenson played at end
part of the time. The formations
of the Varsity were for the most
part fast and well executed.
