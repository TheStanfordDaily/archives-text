The recommendation of the fac
ulty athletic committees that the
intercollegiate agreement as to
holding the annual football game
on University grounds be putin
effect next year is particularly sig
nificant in view of the persistent
objections arising from the gradu
ate treasurers lest the receipts of
the big contest be diminished.
Other reasons than financial ones
have evidently been considered by
the committee, but on the other
hand it does not appear that fiscal
considerations have been entirely
overlooked. The views of the fac
ulty members will be laid before
the intercollegiate athletic commit
tees at their joint meeting in Janu
ary, and will undoubtedly be ac
cepted. It is the plan to have next
year's game held on the University
of California grounds. Removal
of the contests from San Francisco
will meet the approval of everyone
who has the purity of athletics and
development of the sport at heart.
The change was deemed desirable
long ago, and there is no good rea
son why delay should be counten
anced any longer. The greatest
objection to the proposal comes
from the location of Stanford, as it
is maintained that the railroads
are unable to handle such a large
football crowd and that there are
no facilities here for feeding a vast
number of people. The contention
is justifiable if the crowds that see
the game in San Francisco are to
continue as large when the contests
are transferred to University
grounds. There is every reason to
assume that the attendance will be
considerably diminished, because

of the increased time and expense
necessary to see the game; and if
the crowds are only reasonably
large no inconvenience will result.
Naturally the receipts will fall off,
but the expense of leasing land in
San Francisco and erecting bleach
ers that have to be torn
down frequently will be more
than offset by the possession
of permanent grounds. In the
long run the saving will be in
favor of the new arrangement.
The benefits accruing from campus
gameH will manifest themselves in
many ways. Large bodies of
alumni who find it impossible to
combine a trip to San Francisco
with one to California or Stanford
will be enabled to return to their
universities frequently. Biennial
class reunions will ultimately re
sult. Both institutions will bene
fit by thus keeping alive the inter
est of the graduates. College ath
letics will l>e strengthened and ad
vanced, Good will result in many
other ways.
