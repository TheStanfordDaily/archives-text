# METROPOLITAN CONCERT.
## famous New York Orchestra Play Excellent Music in Assembly Hall. 
### 
The concert given by the Metro
politan Opera House Symphony
Orchestra was heard by an enthu
siastic audience in Assembly Hall
yesterday afternoon. Wagner's
Rienzi was the opening number,
and it was finely rendered. The
symphonic poem, "Don Juan," by
Strauss, failed to meet the hearty
appreciation it deserved, since it
was a decided innovation and some
thing never heard here before.
The most popular piece was un
doubtedly the most beautiful of
Liszt's many rhapsodies, the
"Rhapsodie Hongroise,".which was
given with particularly fine expres
sion. As an encore "Loindu Bal"
was played, showing the extraordi
nary pianissimo effect obtainable
even from such a large orchestra.
"The Dance of the Sunfeaet," by
Waller, is something wholly new.
It is based upon American Indian
music, bringing out all the strange
melody and poetry of an Indian
dance.
Mrs. Katharine Fisk was thor
oughly appreciated and was com
pelled to respond to several encores.
Her interpretation of "Softly
Awakens My Heart" showed her
dramatic power, and although her
voice is lacking in perfect sympa
thetic feeling, her range and con
trol are wonderful. These were
shown to perfect advantage in the
encores "Oh, that We Two Were
Maying," and the "Lullaby." For
her second solo, "A Summer Night,"
by Thomas, the audience refused
to be satisfied until she had reap
peared several times.
Mr. Nahan Franko showed him
self master of exquisite interpreta
tion and technique and had to ap
pear several times. Schumann's
"Traumeri" was more heartily
applauded than his solo.
