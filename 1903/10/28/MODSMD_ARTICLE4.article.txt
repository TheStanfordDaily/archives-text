# TALKS ON PHILIPPINES.
## Professor Moses of California Gives Principal Address at Today's Assembly. 
### 
The Assembly hour was this
morning given over to Profes
sor Bernard iMoses of the Univer
sity of California, who spoke on
"Spanish Influence for Civilization
in the Philippines." The speaker
was introduced by President Jordan
as one who, as a member of the
Philippine Commission, has been
largely instrumental in carrying
out one of the best pieces of admin
istrative work in recent history.
"One impressive fact," Professor
Moses said, "which comes from the
study of the old Spanish colonies,
is that their history is tinged with
a peculiar romantic zeal of men
distinguished for piety long after
the other European peoples had
exhausted their religious fervor in
the crusades. But since Spain's
downfall in political power, other
nations, especially America, have
formed an inadequate estimate of
the achievements of that country
in behalf of civilization.
"It was a characteristic of Span
ish colonial legislation that it was
unified and systematized to a
unique extent. All dependencies,
wherever situated, were ruled under
the same laws, and all were subject
to identical methods of control.
This systematic order, while facili
tating practical administrative
work, was not sufficiently adapted
to the exigencies of colonial life.
However good the intentions of the
king, they were poorly executed by
his agents. In the case of the
Philippines, there was little and
infrequent communication between
the crown and the natives. The
islands were within the jurisdiction
of the viceroy of Mexico and were
ruled as a part of that province.
Official communication was restrict
ed to one ship each year between
Manila and Acapulco. Under such
conditions abundant opportunity
was given Spanish officials and
merchants to abuse the natives
with impunity. But these abuses
are apart from the motives of the
Spanish government regarding the
islands.
"The Spanish influence first took
the direction of religious teaching,
and the result was the formal ac
ceptance of Christianity by many
of the Filipinos. The church
turned the minds of these people to
a European point of view, com
pelled them to end their frequent
inter-tribal wars, and to respect
law and order. Towns grew up and
old tribal lines disappeared in a
new allegiance to the supreme
Spanish authority. But owing to
the fact that the Spanish authori
ties discouraged the learning of
Spanish by the natives, after three
hundred and fifty years of Spanish
occupancy less than ten per cent
have any knowledge of the lan
guage. Spain never controlled the
inland tribes, and there were large
sections of the islands where her
influence never touched.
"ThejUnited States is today en
joying the result of conditions
made possible only by a long period
of orderly control. The ground
has been prepared for us, and it is

altogether fitting that we take up
the work left unfinished by Spain
and carry it out to an extent that
was impossible under the stereo
typed system of the older nation."
