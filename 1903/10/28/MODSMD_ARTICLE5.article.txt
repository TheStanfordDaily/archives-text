# PRACTICE IS IMPROVING.
## Changed Line-up Continues in Effect Last Night.â€”Fast Work Done. 
### 
Football practice last evening
was a repetition of the work done
on the previous day. Coach Lan
agan alternated the Second and
Third teams against the Varsitj'
eleven for practice in holding on
place-kicks and punts. The Second
eleven did much the better -work
against the big line, although both
of the minor elevens were able to
break through and block the kicks.
W. Dole continued his practice at
place-kicking.
The form of the Varsity is show
ing a decided improvement over
the apparent slump that character
ized the Nevada game. The
change in line-up that followed as
a result of the loose work in Sat
urday's contest continues in effect.
Van Sickle and Shields are play
ing fairly good ball at the right of
center, and the question as to
whether or not they will be kept
there permanently depends largely
upon what they do against the
Indians today and the Reliance
team Saturday. They are both
heavier men than those they dis
placed, and if they can show equal
football knowledge they will un
doubtedly be kept on the Varsity.
Stephenson was transferred to left
end on the Varsity to fill the place
of Clark, who is not able to line up
on account of a slightly injured
knee. Weller is recovering from
his injuries, but will not enter
scrimmage work before Saturday.

follows:
