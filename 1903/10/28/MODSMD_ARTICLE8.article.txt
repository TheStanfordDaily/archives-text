# PROGRESS OF FACULTY PLAY.
## Rehearsals for "A Scrap of Paper" Proceeding with Much Success. 
### 
The cast of the coming pre
sentation of "A Scrap of Pa
per," to be given in Assem
bly Hall November 6th by mem
bers of the faculty, is being put
through regular rehearsals, and
much progress is being noted.
The play gets its name from the
''scrap of paper" on which Louise
had written a rather sentimentally
worded farewell to Prosper three
years before the play begins. Dur
ing those three years the paper has
reposed in the base of a statue of
Flora, which used to serve hs a
secret post-office. For on this oc
casion Prosper did not get the let
ter, and since the actors in the
little episode separated the next
day, not to meet for three years, the
misunderstanding that resulted had
not been cleared away during that
period. But new that reunion of
the old house party brought the
friends together again, complicat
ing circumstances had arisen to
make the discovery of the letter
somewhat embarrassing to those
concerned. Louise had married
the Baron de la Glaciere, who was
capable of great resentment if he
should learn of his wife's having
had an "affair" before the marriage.
Louise, therefore, is desperately
anxious to recover the paper as
soon as she discovers that it is still
beneath the statue of Flora. But
Prosper learns of its whereabouts
at the same time, and thinking
that by means of it he may be able
to command Louise's influence in
his present suit for the hand of her
sister, he too is anxious to have the
letter in his own possession. But
the entrance of guests thwarts their
repeated efforts to take the coveted
scrap of paper from the statuette,
and when at last Prosper is suc
cessful his action has been observed
by Suzanne, the vivacious and fas
cinating cousin of Louise. She
openly challenges Prosper to keep
the paper from her if he can, and
he eagerl}' accepts.
From here the whole action
centers about that scrap of paper.
Suzanne's pursuit of it carries her
to the fantastically decorated room
into which Prosper has gathered
the stuffed monkeys and other
treasures collected during his vari
ous investigations. Louise, the
baroness, also appears on the scene,
and in order to allay the suspicions
of the frigid baron, Suzanne has to
resort to fictions that complicate
amazingly the relations of the
characters to the momentous scrap
of paper. The more eventful trav
els of the paper then begin. It
gets half burned, it is thrown out
of a window, it serves the simple
minded old professor as a cage for
his beloved tiger-beetle, it is thrown
away, it is scribbled on by another
lover, â€”and during all these adven
tures the fortunes of Prosper and
Suzanne become more inextricably
mixed.
