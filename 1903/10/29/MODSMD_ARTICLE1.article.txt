In the character of the plot the
Plug Ugly this year is an innova
tion. The object is to introduce
the wearing of the Junior plug in
an original manner. The play is
full of unexpected situations. The
first scene opens with a body of
Juniors singing their class song. A
trio on the style of a prologue
follows. When the merriment is
at its height George Goodfellow,
the class president, comes on the
scene and tells them of the predic
ament of their fellow-classmen,
Negative, Leftend, and Queener,
who have been caught infringing
some rule of Paddlealls and have
been placed under lock and key to
await the decision of the Drop-off
Committee. The scene closes with
the Juniors very much depressed,

in striking contrast to their gaiety
at the beginning. After singing a
solemn dirge they accompany their
president to his room to discuss
ways and means to assist their
fellovvc-lassmen.
Scene Two is laid in the Drop-off
Committee's rendezvous. After
roll-call a blast of trumpets and
roll of drums announces the arrival
of Paddlealls. When he is con
vinced that the Committee is suffi
ciently impressed, he sets forth his
tenets in a song and then makes
his complaint. The Sergeant of the
Guard brings in jthe prisoners, and
Paddlealls assures the Drop-off
Committee that the brand of the
criminal is in each brow and that
all that remains is to give the sen
tence. After due deliberation the
Committee gives the imprisoned
men an alternative: they must
either le&ve college or wear some
badge of disgrace which the Com
mittee will designate. The prison
ers are then led back to their cell
and given time to decide as to what
they will do.
The first scene of the second act
is a Junior Class meeting. After
many speeches the class as a body
decide to stand by their fellow
classmen in their trouble and
accept the same punishment.
Scene Two is the sunny side of
Encina, and is the principal scene
of the play. The prisoners, Nega
tive, Leftend, and Queener, are
brought out for an airing by Hem
lock Holmes, who is bribed by the
men to leave them alone for a time.
The scene is abruptly brought to a
close by the appearance of Hemlock
Holmes, who announces that the
Drop-off Committee is awaiting
their decision.
The last scene is introduced by
the Drop-off Committee, who give
a drill in their official regalia
After the Committee have taken
places on their judgment seats, the
Junior Class file in, humming their
dirge. The prisoners are then
marched in and put through some
difficult maneuvers by the Ser
geant. Finally the impressive
scene is completed by the appear
ance of Paddlealls with his court
retinue, who sing his favorite song,
"I'll Have No Junior Capers."
After many startling surprises in
this scene, the object of the play is
fulfilled.
The action is quick throughout
the play, the music assisting great
ly in this respect. The songs, some
ten in number, are new. A tem
porary stage will be erected, and
gasoline jets have .been provided
for lights.
