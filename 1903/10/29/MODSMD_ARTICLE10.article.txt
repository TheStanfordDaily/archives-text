Participation in the hat smash
ing that follows the dedictaion of
the junior plugs at the annual cele
bration has been carefully avoided
by the two under-classes injthe last
two years, and the example must
be followed tomorrow night. The
farce is open to the entire Univer
sity, but the after portion is strictly
an upper-class affair. Previous
freshman and sophomore classes
have voluntarily refrained from
mingling in the encounters that
come after the play. This has led
to a custom, and tradition will see
to it that the pleasant and friendly
contests that will undoubtedly take
place this year are restricted to the
two upper classes.
