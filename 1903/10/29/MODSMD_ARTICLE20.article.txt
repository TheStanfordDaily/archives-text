# Suggest New Tennis Court.
## 
### 
The principal business at the
meeting of the Executive Commit
tee last night was a discussion of
the tennis courts. A committee of
the Tennis Club appointed last
week to consider the advisability
of repairing the old courts, made a
report favoring the laying of two
new courts beside the regulation
court in front of Encina Hall. It
was estimated that very good courts
of sand, dirt, and oil could be laid
down at an expense of $100 each,
or a little more. The matter will
be further considered before any
definite action is taken.
