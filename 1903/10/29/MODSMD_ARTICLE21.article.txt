# New Psychology Instruments.
## 
### 
A large shipment of instruments
for the Psychology department has
recently been received from Ger
many. These were ordered last
May from two well known German
firms, E. Zimmerman of Leipzig,
and Spindler and Hoyer of Got
tingen. In the collection is a very
rare instrument, t lie k vmographion,
designed by Ludwig Baltzar. An
other apparatus is the Hipp chron
ascope, which measures down to
one one thousandth of a second in
recording time, and the Marlike
color mixer used in blending color
disks by rapid rotations. The
pneumograph, spygmograph, and
plethysmograph are employed in
determining changes in the circula
tion of the blood accompanying a
mental process. One of the most
interesting is a so called complica
tion apparatus for showing actual
time occurrence of apparently si
multaneous events.
