# THIRTY-THREE TO NOTHING.
## Varsity Plays Poor Ball, but Easily Defeats Chemawa Indians Yesterday. 
### 
The game between the Varsity
and Chemawa yesterday resulted
in u 83 to 0 victory for Stanford.
The plays of the Indians were not
organized, their defensive work was
ragged, and their tackling poor.
Saunders, whose regular position
is full-back, but who was pitted
against Sprott in yesterday's game,
played the best of the visitors.
His kicking was first-class. He is
a cool and sure punter. He kicked
eighteen times yesterday for an
average of from thirty-five to forty
yards.
Stanford played a loose game.
This was especially true in the first
half of the game, when the regular
Varsity men were in the line-up.
Twenty-one men were used during
the course of the contest. Chalmers,'
Stott, Clark, and Thompson did
especially good work. The Univer
sity of California football team
saw the game.
W. H. Dole played for the first
time in nearly two weeks, but before
the close of the first half had to
retire on account of further injury
to his right knee, which may keep
him out of the practice games for
another week.
Chemawa made the first kick-off,
to Chalmers, who ran the ball in
fifty yards. A series of end runs
and cross bucks carried the ball
over the line. The rest of the half
was spent in securing another
touchdown. Sprott kicked both
goals. With four Freshmen and
the majority of the other eight
players Second team men, Stanford
improved in the second half and
scored four touchdowns. Stephenson
kicked one goal and missed two.
Sprott missed the other. The final
score was thirty-three to nothing.
