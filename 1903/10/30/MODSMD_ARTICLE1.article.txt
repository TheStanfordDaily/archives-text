# VARSITY VS. RELIANCE.
## Athletic Club Will Play Stanford Tomorrow for the Last Time This Season. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30
Stanford will meet the Reliance
Athletic Club eleven for the third
and last time this year. The first
game ended with no score; the
second resulted in a six to nothing
victory for Stanford; and tomor
row's contest is liable to be a repe
tition of one or the other of the
former scores. The last game with
Reliance was four weeks ago. Octo
ber 17th the clubmen defeated
Nevada by a score of twelve to five.
One week ago Stanford played a
tie game with Nevada. These re
sults would indicate an advantage
in favor of Reliance in tomorrow's
contest. At any rate the game will
be as close and interesting as any
played here this year.
The approximate line-up will be:

Last night's practice was devoted
almost entirely to the line. The
backs were put at catching and
running in punts, while the scrim
mage lines were formed without
the presence of the back-fields. The
strength of the First and Second
eleven line-players in breaking
through was given a thorough test
by this means. Practice closed
with a full line-up of both elevens,
but no formations were tried. The
entire time was given up to prac
tice in holding the line on punts
and place-kicks.
The only real heavy work that
hnrs been (lone this week was in the
Chemawa game Wednesday. Ever
since Nevada went through the
line in Saturday's game, Head-
Coach Lanagan has been directing
his efforts to strengthening that part
of the team. Van Sickle and
Shields continue on the First team,
but Hyde and Stillman are giving
them a close race for the positions.
The aggressiveness of Stephenson
and Stott is bringing them to
notice.
Following the Reliance game
tomorrow the Varsity will have
nearly a week of practice before it
plays Multnomah Friday. The
Multnomah game was originally
scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 7th,
but this has been changed to one
day earlier.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30
