The method of giving out tickets
to the rooting section at the inter
collegiate game will meet general
approval. Instead of allowing each
student to buy as many Â»b ten
seats, the plan this season will
allow hut one ticket in the rooting
section to be sold to each person.
The names of purchasers will he
checked off in the Directory, and
every possible precaution will be
taken to prevent any tickets falling
into the hands of disinterested out
siders who fill up the space in the
cheering section and make the
singing and yelling difficult and
disintegrated. Convenience is to
be allowed in the case of those who
cannot stand in line any consider
able time by permitting others to
get their tickets on the presentation
of signed orders. These will be
placed on file to be used in case any
disputes arise after the close of the
sale. The plan of distribution is a
good one, and will effectively solve
the problem of making the Stan
ford support at the annual game
express the volume of enthusiasm
that it is capable of when rightly
organized. Seating the students
on the same side of the field caused
some little dissatisfaction, but
other changes that have been made
this year give promise of entirely
harmonious and agreeable condi
tions next year, when the contest
will be held on the University of
California grounds with new
bleachers. Allotting seats to the
alumni of both institutions is not
a concession in any sense of the
word, but merely a recognition that
should have been shown the gradu
ates a long time ago.
