# "Sequoia" to Come Out Monday.
## 
### 
The fifth issue of the Sequoia
will be on sale Monday. The lead
ing article is "Boating Reminiscen
ces," by Professor A. W. Smith.
This is an interesting account of
Cornell's early successes on the
water, with a lesson for Stanford
drawn from the experience that
Cornell had in winning her boating
supremacy. MissE. Mirrielees, '06,
contributes a football story that
points a moral. K. A. Bickel, '07,
makes his first appearance in the
Sequoia with a realistic newspaper
story entitled "Scooping the City."
In a story of Paris, "At the Moulin
Rouge," Miss H. M. Patterson, '05,
has characterized true local color.
Miss Marie Burnham, '04, and Miss
Clara Lathrop. '06, contribute the
shorter stories. George I). Barnett,
'06, has a sketch entitled "Spring."
The comments by a crank are re
sumed in this issue with an article
briefly headed "Help." Thesecond
editorial suggests that the Sequoia
might profitably become a monthly,
and advocates the change.
