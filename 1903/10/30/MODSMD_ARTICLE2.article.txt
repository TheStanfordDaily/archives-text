# TICKETS FOR GAME.
## Each Rooter Will be Allowed to Purchase Only One Admission. 
### 
Tickets for the big game will
probably be on sale by Wednesday
of next week. The place of sale
will be at the box office on the oval.
An important change has been
made this year in regard to rooters'
tickets. Heretofore each person in
line has been allowed to buy tick
ets to the number of ten. Under
that plan many of the tickets have
been purchased for outside people
whose presence in the rooting sec
tion has broken the effectiveness of
the yells and songs. In order to
avoid this difficulty but one ticket
to the cheering section will be sold
to each student, and bis name will
be checked off when given a ticket.
However, a provision will be made
whereby one student can purchase
tickets for others by presenting
written orders properly signed.
Five hundred tickets in this section
will be allowed to Stanford. They
will cost $1 50 each.
In addition to the seats reserved
for rooters there will be placed on
sale about 3,500 other tickets, rang
ing in price from $1.50 to $2.50.
These are to remain on the campus
three or four days, and those left
will be taken to San Francisco and
placed on sale at the stores of
Clabrough, Golcher, and Company
and H. E. Skinner and Son. Two
thousand seats have been reserved
for alumni of the two universities,
fifteen hundred for California and
five hundred for Stanford.
Tickets to Fischer's theater for
the evening of the game will also
be placed on sale on the campus the
day following the football sale. An
unlimited number of these, located
in the central part of the house,
will be sold to students at $1.00
each. The boxes will be given to
the football men.
