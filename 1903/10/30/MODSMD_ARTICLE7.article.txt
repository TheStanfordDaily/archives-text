# The 						Faculty Play.
## 
### 
The "Scrap of Paper," which is
to be given next Friday evening by
faculty members for the benefit of
the new Students' Guild Hospital,
is one of the most noted of the
dramas of Mr. J. Palgrave Simp
son, a member of the Dramatic Au
thors' Society. In the chief role,
that of Suzanne de lluseville, Rose
Coglan is said to have scored one
of her greatest successes, and the
play is associated in the public
mind also with the Kendalls, who
have played it frequently with
great success. It is a play, how
ever, especially well suited for am
ateur production, each of the parts
having distinct individuality, and
the action of the play as a whole
being quick, and developed in
bright, well written dialogue.
