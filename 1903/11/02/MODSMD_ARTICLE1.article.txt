# SEVENTEEN TO NOTHING.
## Reliance Team Greatly Weakened is Easily Defeated by the Varsity. 
### 
Saturday the Varsity defeated
the Reliance clubmen for the second
time this season in a game which
was the most one-sided of the series.
A combination of fast playing and
good team work on offense was .as
much responsible for the easy vic
tory as a decided weakness on the
part of Reliance. Atkinson, Wool
ridge, and Mueller, who have been
ranked as among the strongest
players on the visiting eleven, were
displaced by lighter and less expe
rienced substitutes, and the shift
ing of Hamilton from tackle to
full-back was responsible for a
great number of easy plunges into
the line.
Stanford scored eleven points in
the first half, Sprott failing on one
goal. Weller played the game
which is peculiarly his own. With
almost complete disregard of the
instructions to buck low and follow
his interference, that the coaches
have been drilling into him since
the Freshman game, he proved
himself remarkably strong at
breaking through the Reliance
line. Tarpey and Chalmers at
halves played in first-class shape.
Roth touchdowns were due to the
good line-bucking of the three
backs. Tandem bucks and plunges
past tackle were the ordinary for
mations.
In the second half an almost
complete substitution was made in
the line-up, and eight Freshmen
were given a chance in the game.
Reliance proved a harder opponent
in this half, and a kicking duel oc
cupied most of the period. With
only a few minutes to play, how
ever, the Varsity got the ball in
the middle of the field and carried
it to a touchdown by hard, short
plunges into the line. Dole was
pushed across for a touchdown just
before the whistle blew, and later
kicked an easy goal.

The game afforded a good oppor
tunity to place judgment on the
offensive ability of the Varsity.

The plays were given with greater
rapidity than at any previous time
during the season, and the team
work seems to have made a very
apparent improvement. The game
was especially noticeable in that
individual playing was lost in the
work of the eleven, although Weller
at full-hack and Stephenson at end
called attention to themselves by
their aggressiveness. Reliance
made first down only once during
the contest, and was forced to punt
repeatedly to save herself from sur
rendering the ball to the Cardinal.
In punting Stanford was able to
average little better than twenty
yards, and her great weakness in
this department of the game was
made clearly apparent.
