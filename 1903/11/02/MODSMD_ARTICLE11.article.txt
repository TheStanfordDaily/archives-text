The feeling of discouragement'
that the Nevada game aroused
among Stanford men has been
greatly displaced by a growing feel
ing of faith in the power of the
team that will represent the Uni
versity this year. Nor is this feel
ing to any unjustifiable extent the
result of the showing Stanford
made against Reliance. It is due
to a proper readjustment of the
sentiment that has dominated the
campus during a football season
that may truthfully be called a
successful one, whatever the score
of the big game may prove. The
last week of practice and the Re
liance game have brought to light
several important things. While
there are no sensational players on
the Stanford eleven, there are sub
stitutes for nearly every place on
the team, in whom nearly as much
confidence may be placed as in the
men who will make up the final
personnel of the eleven. The team
is playing faster football than be
fore, and is gradually approaching
a state in which it may be called a
rapid scoring one. So much is
greatly encouraging. But in two
respects the team is still lament
ably weak. There is no first-class
punter, and the line can not be de
pended on to hold. During the re
maining two weeks a punter who
can meet California's captain on a
nearer plane of equality must be
developed, and team-work must be
drilled into the line so that co
operation can help to overcome the
misfortune of lightness. Two
weeks' consistent development
should be a period long enough to
enable the coaches to put into the
field a light team, but one which
will number among its strong
points speed, superior team work,
and an abundance of first-class
substitutes.
