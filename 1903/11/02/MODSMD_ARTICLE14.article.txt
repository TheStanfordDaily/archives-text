Editor Daily Palo Alto:
These hist few days of football
practice should find every Stanford
rooter on the bleachers learning the
songs and mass cheering.
There never was a Stanford team
that has trained harder and more
consistently than the present one,
and the very least we who do not
play can do is to appear on the
side-lines and let the team know
that the college is behind them.
The intercollegiate game is but two
weeks off, and in that time we
must bring our yelling and singing
to perfection.
Let every man learn the songs in
the book, for we shall use every
one; what is more, every student
should appear at song practice.
This week there will be song
practice with the band on the
bleachers. Yell Leader.
