Editor Daily I'alo Alto:
I wonder whether the person
who writes so enthusiastically
about Mr. J. Palgrove Simpson's
"A Scrap of Paper" is aware of the
fact that the }>lay is nothing but a
translation of Sardou's "Les I'attes
de Mouche," performed rirst in
Paris at the Theatre du Gymnase
early in 18G1. To be sure his seem
ing misinformation is excusable,
for the English play as it stands
makes no acknowledgment of its
indebtedness, the only evidence
that there is anything French about
it being apparently the fact that it
is contained in Mr. French's collec
tion of Standard Drama. Yet I
thought it might be interesting to
point out this relation. Sardou is
eminent in French literature for
his skill in construction of plots,
and his "Les I'attes de Mouche" is
one of his most characteristic and
finished compositions.
