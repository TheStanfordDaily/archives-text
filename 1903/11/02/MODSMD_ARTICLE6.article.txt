# JUNIORS DEDICATE PLUGS
## Annual Celebration Held on Oval Friday Night with Much Success. 
### 
Nearly eighteen hundred people
witnessed the annual celebration of
the Junior class held on the foot
ball oval Friday night. The Plug
Ugly was a complete success. It
was one of the best performances
given by a junior class at Stanford.
The music, which was written for
the occasion, was especially good.
The character of Paddlealls, by H.
E.Bush,was well acted,as were those
of Bill Negative, Charley Leftend,
and Jack Queener, represented by
L. D. Byrne, F. M. Wilbur, and
H. D. Wheeler. More attention
was paid to costuming than hereto
fore, and this added to the brill
iancy of the scenes.
In the first scene of act one the
Juniors entered singing their class
song. In the midst of this cele
bration the class was informed by
its president that Bill Negative,
Charlie Leftend, and Jack Queen
er, three of the most prominent
men of the class, had gotten into
trouble with the manager of En
cina by coming into the hall re
peatedly after eleven o'clock. The
Juniors proposed plans to aid their
fellow-classmen to gain their lib
erty.
Scene two is laid in the office of
the Drop-off Committee. Paddle
alls appeared with very impressive
ceremony and gives vent to bis in
jured feelings. He laid his trouble
before the Drop-off Committee. The
three prisoners were declared guilty
by Paddlealls. In sentencing the
men, the committee gave them the
alternative of leaving college or
wearing a badge of disgrace which
the committee was to select.
The first scene of the second act
opened with a Junior class meet
ing. A firm stand was taken by
the class to stand by the men and
if need be-leave college themselves
in a body. The last scene opened
with a drill by the Drop-off Com
mittee. They brought in a large
Sophomore fez, which had been
selected by the committee as the
emblem of disgrace which the three
students must wear if they re
mained in the University.
The prisoners were brought in to
receive their sentence. The com
mittee ordered them to leave the
campus at once. Here the Juniors
entered in a body and informed
the committee of their intention to
leave the University with their fel
low-classmen. At this juncture
Prince David came in and an
nounced that the prisoners were
innocent of the charges preferred
against them. Me related that
they had been doing work in the
new Astronomy department and
had located a falling star. By their
skilful computation they had found
the star was to hit the northeast
corner of the Memorial Arch, and
hence the Arch was being moved.
In consideration of this great bene
fit to the University, Prince David
recommended that the committee
make reparation for the injustice
done the men. The committee,
acting on this suggestion, changed
the emblem of shame to a crown of
honor. This crown insured the

wearers of their diplomas and made
them immune from all faculty
edicts. With these words the com
mittee handed out the Plugs, which
the Juniors accepted, and to the
music of their class song they be
gan their traditional march around
the quad.
