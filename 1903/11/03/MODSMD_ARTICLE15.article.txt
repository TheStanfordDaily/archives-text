The Sequoia editorially advo
cates changing the magazine from
a bi-weekly to a monthly after this
year, giving as a reason that in the
longer time allowed for prepara
tion a more pretentious publication
both in size and quality could be
produced. Such a plan deserves
the hearty support of all the stu
dents. In the early days of the
University the Sequoia was first
issued as a monthly, but later was
turned into a weekly. In this
form it carried on a precarious ex
istence until 1901, when it was
changed to a semi-monthly. The
wisdom of the move was at once
apparent. The Sequoia as a
monthly would more adequately
represent Stanford. It would give
added honor to positions on its
stafffand greater value to its adver
tising space, since the general sta
bility of the paper would be as
sured. Substitution of the semi
monthly for the weekly edition
proved salutary, and the proposed
change to a form in keeping with
the older literary magazines of
eastern colleges seems well advised.
