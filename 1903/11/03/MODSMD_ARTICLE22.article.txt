Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Your correspondent signing him
self "A student of French Litera
ture" discloses an interesting fact
when he points out that Sardou
is the virtual author of the "Scrap
of Paper," which we are to see
within a few days. But is the air
of superior wisdom with which he
turns sarcastic comment on the
recent article altogether justifiable?
Is your representative supposed to
go back of the official published
records in writing a report for the
paper? And does your correspon
dent prove that Mr. Simpson has
not so improved the material he
derived from Sardou that he has a
right to put his name on the title
page? After all, what do we care
whether Sardou or Simpson wrote
the "Scrap of Paper"? What we
want is to see a bright, snappy
comedy, and from all accounts it is
such that we shall see. If Sardou
had a hand in it, so much the
better. We have it on the testi
mony of the writer of last night's
communication that Sardou is
"eminent" in his dramatic skill.
Enough of academic controversy,
then. For us, here and now, "the
play's the thing."
Tmeater-Goeu.
