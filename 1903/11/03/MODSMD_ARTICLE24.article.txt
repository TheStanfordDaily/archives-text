# DELAY IN BUILDING WORK.
## New Gymnasium May Be Completed By End of Next Year. 
### 
Work on the new Gymnasium is
at a complete standstill, and only
a few men are being employed on
the large additions that are being
built on the Museum. The outer
and inner walls of the Gymnasium
are completed up to the second
story. The delay in carrying on
the work is largely due to the la
bor troubles of last summer, when
the union stonemasons went out
on a strike because some of the
stone used had been cut by non
union labor. Upon the refusal of
the men to resume work the con
tractor secured an extension of six
months in the time allowed him
for the completion of the building,
which the trustees were willing to
grant. Although it cannot be said
definitely when the building work
will be recommenced, it is hoped
to have the Gymnasium completed
by the end of next year.
About a dozen men are busy on
the brick-work of the Museum ad
ditions. The basement has been
completed, and the first story is
finished for about half the distance
around. Although the strikes
have affected the work on this
building, the delay has not been of
any especial importance. There is
no special demand for this build
ing at the present time, and the
contract does not call for its early
completion. Aery little work is
being done on the southeast corner
of the outer quadrangle, and none
on the south arcade.
