—A strip of soil five inches deep
and about four feet wide has been
removed from the eastern turn of

satisfactory in the past, and an at
tempt is being made to improve the
track by filling in the strip with
dirt similar to that used in build
ing the new runway.
—The new runway for the jumps
has been completed, and it is now
ready for use. The foundation is
composed of an equal mixture of
cinders and clay, and the surface
is covered with an inch of cinders.
Built with a slight slope to each

ter perfectly, and be ready for use
immediately after a rain.
