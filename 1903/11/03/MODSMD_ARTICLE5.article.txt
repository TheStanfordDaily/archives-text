# THE
						WEEK’S PROGRESS.
## Football Situation Finds Eleven Improved in Team Work.— Punting Deficient. 
### 
The football situation has taken
on a very definite form during the
past week of practice. In the de
velopment of the team the coaches
have accomplished a great deal,
but there still remain several prob
lems which they must solve before
the intercollegiate game on the
14th. While the team is far from
being chosen there are several men
who, barring accidents, are prac
tically certain of a place. Sprott,
Thompson, and Ilauverman are
fixtures in the line, but the fight
among Jacobs, Van Sickle, and
Hyde for the other guard, and be
tween Still man and Shields for the
other tackle, is still undecided. On
the ends Clark and Smith appear
to have the best of it, and since
Preston has been forced to leave
the game because of an old injury
to his head, Stephenson is the most
logical second choice.
Behind the line but little can be
stated as to the ultimate disposi
tion of the eight first-class backs
who are fighting hard for a place.
Captain Bansbach will be field
general and will act as quarter-back
unless he should be injured. But
should he be forced to leave the
game, Stott will step into his place.
Weller appears to be the man most
apt to be given first chance at full
back. Although he is still weak
in that he lacks experience and
bucks high, his weight and aggres
siveness are strong points in his
favor. Scholfield, who has im
proved in his line-plunging very
consistently, has still a chance to
beat Weller out. Dole can easily
be chosen as one half-back, and
Tarpey seems to be the man most
likely to step into his place if he is
forced to leave the game. At right
half Chalmers, Brennan, and G.
Dole are all possibilities, with no
man very far ahead of the others
in the race.
With the final personnel of the
team in such an undecided state,
there are two important questions
before the coaches. They must
drill team work into fourteen or
fifteen men, so that when the final
selection is made there will be no
ragged work in the line or on the part
of the backs, and they must develop
a punter. The team work is, on
the whole, good. The men play
together on offense, and the line
men are backed up well on defense.
After the last preliminary game
has been played the work will
probably be largely devoted to sig
nal practice and a development of
the fine points of the game.
The mooted question of who will
be the man to return Overall's
puntw is still undecided." In all
probability Sprott will do the kick
ing, but he is decidedly the inferior
of California's captain in this re
spect. In two respects California
has a clear advantage. At the
present time she has a heavier line,
and she has Overall to do her
punting. To offset this advantage
Stanford will try to putin the field
a lighter but faster team, with
stronger backs and superior team
work.
