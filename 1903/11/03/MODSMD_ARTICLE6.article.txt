# DUDLEY WILL BE UMPIRE.
## Last Year's Official Chosen to Act Again at Intercollegiate Game. 
### 
E. C. Dudley of Yule will act as
umpire at tiie intercollegiate game
on the 14th. No one has been se
lected as yet for referee. Dudley,
who played half-back on the Yale
varsity for several years, officiated
in the big game last year. His de
cisions on that occasion gave satis
faction to the partisans of both
colleges, as he was quick and cer
tain in rendering judgment.
