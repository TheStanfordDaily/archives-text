# Seats for Chamber Concerts.
## 
### 
The choosing of seats for the
chamber concerts will take place
on the morning of November 7th,
from 9 until 12 a.m. Charts will
be placed at the Bookstore on the
campus, and at the Stanford
Pharmacy in Palo Alto. This
drawing of seats is only for those
holding full season tickets, and in
tending to have the ticket used for
tlie four concerts. Subscriptions
may be paid up at this time.
To accommodate those not holding
full season tickets, a special draw
ing will be held before each concert.
Preceding the public sale for a
given concert, charts will be ex
posed at the above named places,
open only to the holders of such
partial tickets, and those holding
full season tickets, who intend to
use them on less than the four con
certs â€”that is for more than one per
son. For the first concert this
drawing will occur on Monday,
November 9th, from 9 to 12 a.m.
At noon on this day the public sale
will begin.
Those who have purchased tick
ets intending to use them as season
tickets, and who may later desire
to use them up on less than the full
series of concerts, should, at one of
the special drawings, give up their
season seat, exchanging it for one
of the seats desired. As there are
only about four hundred subscrib
ers, and the seating capacity of the
hall is over sixteen hundred, no one
will have to occupy an undesirable
seat. All drawings may be made
by proxy if so desired.
