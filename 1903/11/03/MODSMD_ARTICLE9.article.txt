# TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
## Matches Will be Held Tomorrow to Select Players for New Court. 
### 
In selecting those who will enter
the tennis tournament tomorrow on
the new courts, it was decided to
make a drawing from all the mem
bers of the Tennis Club, instead of
receiving formal entries. Thedraw
ing was held tonight.
A regular tournament will he
held, and play is to continue until
only ten players are left in the
contest. This selection is in no de
gree final, since the plan provides
that the ten successful players are
to be constantly subject to chal
lenge from their defeated oppo
nents. This plan is a mere tenta
tive arrangement for the present,
and the tournament is held to
stimulate interest. Those players
who cannot compete Wednesday
may by mutual agreement postpone
their matches to some other day
this week.
