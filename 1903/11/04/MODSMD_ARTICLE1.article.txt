# SNAPPY FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Varsity Scores Six Points on Second Eleven After Fast Work. 
### 
The Varsity and the second team
lined up for twenty minutes of fast
scrimmage work last night. The
teams were very evenly matched,
and it was only by the hardest
kind of playing that the Varsity
was able to score one touchdown.
The Varsity kicked off to the Sec
ond eleven and took the ball on
the twenty-five-yard line on downs.
The Second team held twice and
Dolewas sent back to try a drop-kick
for goal. The ball was blocked,
but the Varsity held for downs
only to lose possession of the ball
again on an inexcusable fumble.
Chalmers was given the ball and
broke through the Varsity line for
a fifteen-yard gain. He was
downed by Bansbach in the back
field. Again the Varsity braced
and took the ball away on downs.
They carried the ball to the middle
of the field and then Dole, Weller,
and Brennan were sent smashing
through the line of the Second
team for yard after yard. Plunges
into the left side of the Second
team's line were productive of the
easiest gains. The Second eleven
could not withstand the fierce on
slaughts on their line and the ball
was carried over for a touchdown.
An easy goal made the score 6-0.
The teams were lined up again, but
darkness prevented any further
scoring.
The practice was the hardest and
fastest that has been held on the
oval this season. The Varsity exe
cuted its plays with precision and
yet with unaccustomed speed.
The last open practice was held
this afternoon with the exception
of one Friday of this week, and one
on Thursday of next week. The
remaining open practices will be
the occasion of organized song
practice on the bleachers, in which
the band will participate. Cali
fornia has already begun secret
practice, which will continue un
til the day of the intercollegiate
game.
