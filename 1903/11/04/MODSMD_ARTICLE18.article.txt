Intercollegiate freßhman con
tests in baseball and track have
been recommended by the
faculty athletic committees of Cali
fornia and Stanford. These two
additions to the athletic calendar
will do much to raise the standard
of the first-year teams. This is es
pecially true in baseball, where the
present system allows the two un
derclasses to meet for their annual
contest with scarcely any practice.
The game is carried out under con
ditions that are not conducive to
first-class contests. After the close
of the series of matches, interest
ceases among the freshmen and
very few remain on the field for
daily practice. With the game
holding such a mediocre position
little inducement is offered to can
didates, and the number of players
is a great deal smaller than would
be the case if there were an inter
collegiate match to look forward
to. Besides giving importance to
the contest, a game with California
will do much toward bringing out
the spirit of the entering class.
After the contest, the freshman ma
terial that is left will be in much
better condition to offer practice
games for the Varsity. While con
ditions on the track are not ex
actly the same, a meet with Cali
fornia will stimulate interest
among the freshmen and undoubt
edly increase the number of
candidates. A track meet with
California is perfectly feasible in
the spring. It may be possible to
inaugurate a baseball game at the
same time, but it is very doubtful
whether enough practice could be
given to the candidates when only
one diamond is at the disposal of
all the players. It may be possible
to provide another diamond where
the freshmen could be given prac
tice under the direction of some old
Varsity player. In this way at

tention would not be taken from
the Varsity. In any case annual
intercollegiate freshman games
will be certainties when the new
grounds are built.
