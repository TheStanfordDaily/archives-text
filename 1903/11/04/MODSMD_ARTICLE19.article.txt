Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The committee on '04 class pins
has received from Hammersmith
& Field a sample which can be
seen at the Bookstore. It is like
the pin of last year, except that the
enamel is reduced to a rim around
the edge to set off the letters in the
margin. The remainder of the pin
containing the Palo Alto tree and
'04, is finished in antique gold.
The committee feels that the pin is
a vast improvement oyer last year's
and still retains all the originality
of the University seal. It will
probably be adopted as the class
pin, but during the remainder of
the week opportunity will be given
to Seniors to see the sample and
express their opinion. The price
of the pin, with the patent clasp
which is attached to the sample, is
$3; without the clasp, $2.75.
