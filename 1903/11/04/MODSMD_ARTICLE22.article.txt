# Study of Mosquitoes.

### 
Miss Isabel McCracken, '03, as
sistant in Entomology, has been
engaged during the past summer
and early fall in an investigation
of the mosquitoes of the San Fran
cisco Bay region. In this study
Miss McCracken has been acting
under an appointment bv Dr.
Howard, United States entomolo
gist, as special assistant in an in
vestigation authorized by the Car
negie Institute. Miss McCracken's
work is the introduction to a study
which will eventually cover the
whole state.
A report of the work so far done
has just been sent to Dr. Howard,
at Washington, and from this are
extracted the following facte, which
should be of interest to residents
on the campus and in Palo Alto:
Fourteen species of mosquitoes,
of which three or four have not
heretofore been known, have been
found in this vicinity. Of these
fourteen species, three are malaria
breeding and disseminating kinds.
The most abundant and trouble
some mosquito on the campus is a
species which breeds exclusively in
salt water, its young stages being
passed in the pools and inlets of
the bay marshes. The winged
adults, however, find their way in
swarms as far inland as eight or
ten miles. Among the fresh water
breeders is a tiny species which has
been found heretofore in Algeria
only. This is an extraordinary
case of geographical distribution.
It is interesting to note that of
the three distinct species of malaria
bearing mosquitoes recorded as oc
curring in the United States two
are found on the campus, together
with a third species not before de
scribed (named by Miss McCracken
Anopheles Franciscanus). While
the bay region is at present in no
sense to be called a malarial dis
trict, it is obvious that if the mala
rial parasite were to be by any
means introduced in force in the
region the means already exists for
disseminating it effectively. Steps
toward stamping out, or at any
rate considerably restricting, the
Anopheles mosquitoes may be
taken. As the three species occur
ring here areÂ»all fresh water breed
ers, and but few permanent breed
ing-places for them exist in this
vicinity, remedial measures can
probably be successfully used.
