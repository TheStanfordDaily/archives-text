# NEVADA DEBATE ASSURED.
## Intersociety Debating League Votes a Contest for Second Team. 
### 
The favorable action of the Uni
versity Debating Club taken a
short time ago on the advisability
of arranging a debate with the
University of Nevada for the Stan
ford second team was ratified today
by the executive committee of the
Intersociety Debating League. J.
F. English, '01, E. W. Rice, '02,
and 0. C. Spencer, '04, members of
the Intercollegiate Debating Com
mittee, were asked sometime ago
to confer with the executive com
mittee of the student body as to the
financial part of the undertaking.
The executive committee received
the report favorably and has ad
vised the intercollegiate debating
committee to proceed with the ar
rangements. The date has not
been decided upon definitely, but
the contest will probably be held
next semester. The debate is to
take place at Reno, Nevada.
