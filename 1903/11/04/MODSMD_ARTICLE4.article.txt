# THE
						FACULTY PLAY.
## Sale of Seats for "A Scrap of Paper" Proceeding with Success. 
### 
The seat sale for the play to be
given in Assembly Hall by mem
bers of the faculty is going on very
satisfactorily. The number of
tickets already sold insures a good
sized audience.
It is to the equipment of the
Guild Hospital that the receipts of
"A Scrap of Paper" will be devot
ed. The hospital is still without
an operating room, and the man
agers of the Guild find that they
are greatly hampered in their
work by the necessity of assuming
in the same year not only the run
ning expenses of the hospital, but
also the great initial expense of
renovating and equipping the hos
pital building. A generous re
sponse on the part of the public to
this effort on behalf of the Guild
will substantially assist the man
agement, whether the proceeds of
the play be devoted to the immedi
ate equipment of an operating
room, or to some other purpose.
The price of seats has been put
low, so as to be easily within the
reach of all. Fifty cents is the
uniform price for all seats, wher
ever they may be.
