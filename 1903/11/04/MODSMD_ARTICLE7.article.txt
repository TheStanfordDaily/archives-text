# ARRANGING FOR TRIP.
## Advance Agent Chosen to Perfect Itinerary for Musical Clubs. 
### 
Harry J. Edwards, '01, has been
selected as advance agent for the
Musical Clubs on their northern
trip during the holidays. He will
probably reach the University Fri
day and will start on his northern
trip about Tuesday. He has been
over the ground twice before and
the final itinerary will be left large
ly to him. Most of the cities have
been decided upon, but the dates
of the concerts depend upon other
attractions which may be visiting
these places. Redding will prob
ably be omitted from the list and
Red Bluff substituted.
About the same number of men
as last year will take the trip. The
following is a list of seventeen
towns which will in all probability
be visited: Stockton, Sacramento,
Red Bluff, Ashland, Eugene,Salem,
The Dalles, Portland, Everett,
Whatcom, Tacoma, Oregon City,
Vancouver, Olympia, Seattle, Vic
toria, and Vancouver, B. C.
