# Officers of Combined Clubs.
## 
### 
The members of the Combined
Clubs met last night and elected
by acclamation C. H. Baker, '04,
president, and L. D. Byrne, '05,
secretary-treasurer. Baker was
leader of the Glee Club last year,
and has been a member of the two
musical clubs since he entered col
lege. Byrne has been specialist of
the clubs for the last two years.
Reports were read from the chair
men of several of the committees
chosen to look up Stanford men in
the towns to be visited on the holi
day trip of the clubs. These were
mainly unsatisfactory, and it was
decided to have a complete report
from each chairman at a meeting
to be held sometime next week.
