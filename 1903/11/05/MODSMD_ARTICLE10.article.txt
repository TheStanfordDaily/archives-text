# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETS.
## Offer of Assistance Made to Tennis Club May Be Withdrawn. 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee of the student body last
night it was reported that the
Tennis Club had taken practically
no steps towards the collection of
funds to cover the cost of the ten
nis court built in the spring in
front of Encina. There is still $280
due upon this court. Some time
ago the Executive Committee agreed
to appropriate $250 for two new
courts if the Tennis Club would
collect $280, much of which was
subscribed a year ago. Owing to
this apparent failure of the tennis
club to fulfill its promise, the Exec
utive Committee last night consid
ered the advisability of withdraw
ing its offer of $250. Definite action
was postponed for a week to afford
the Tennis Club further time.
The plans of the combined musi
cal clubs for a northern tour were
submitted and approved. The mat
ter of a deposit from each member
of the clubs making the trip was
discussed at some length. Last
year the deposit of each member
was $20, and after the final account
ing $2 was returned. In order to
prevent any demand upon student
body funds to cover a deficit this
year, the Executive Committee de
cided to make each member going
on the trip deposit $20 in cash, and
in addition give a note for $5. It
was considered that this amount
would completely safeguard the
student body treasury from any
loss.
