# FAST PRACTICE OF VARSITY.
## Short Line-up Held Yesterday.â€”California Eleven Practically Picked Today. 
### 
After the signal practice and
punting last night the Varsity
lined up against tiie Second team
for fifteen minutes of snappy scrim
mages. The team seems to he gain
ing in vim and speed with every
line-up, and although the absence
oi Weller behind the line was no
ticeable the Varsity was successful
in its plunges into the Second
eleven's line. The Multnomah
players, who arrived on the cam
pus yesterday morning, attended
the practice and were favorably
impressed with the way the Varsity
played. This afternoon the first
secret practice was held.
At California the team has been
given secret practice throughout
the week. The choice of the men
who will face Stanford on the 14th
has practically been determined.
The places in the line are as cer
tainly filled as if the coaches had
given out an authoritative state
ment. Stroud at center and Over
all and Stow at guards will form
the center trio. Each man is rated
high in his position and has weight,
strength, and experience to make
him a valuable man to California.
Howard and Heitmuller at
tackle, and Hudson and Demerritt
at ends, are fixtures on the Califor
nia line. Hudson has been out of
the game some time, owing to sev
ere injuries, but Trainer Christie
has announced that he will be able
to play by the first of next week.
Behind the line there is still a
chance that some of the men who
are now playing with the varsity
may be forced out of their places.
More, California's veteran quarter
back, has decidedly distanced Bel
knap and Geary, who have been
fighting hard for the place. Force
is the most likely candidate for
full-back. Among the half dozen
ordinary half-backs, the two who
will probably complete the person
nel of the California eleven are
Mini and Whipple. Mini has
made an enviable name for himself
as a light player, dangerous on end
runs and strong on running in
punts. Whipple plays a similar
style of game, so that the chief
burden of bucking the line will fall
upon Force, the full-back.
There is considerable encourage
ment at California over the strong
improvement the football squad
has experienced in the la6t week.
The men are rounding into first
class physical condition, and there
is a dash and enthusiasm about
daily practices that have hitherto
been lacking. While the feeling of
complete confidence of victory that
prevailed at California during the
earlier weeks of the season has in a
measure disappeared, nevertheless
there is a strong feeling that victory
will rest with the veteran Blue and
Gold team, on the fourteenth.
