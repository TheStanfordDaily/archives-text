Tomorrow night the members of
the faculty will present in Assem
bly Hall "A Scrap of Paper," for
the benefit of the Students' Guild
Hospital. Entirely beyond the
worth of the play as a clever farce,
there is an added reason that the
enthusiastic support of the students
should be accorded it. It is typical
of the encouragement that has been
extended to the Guild in the past
year and will continue to be given
to this organization as long as it
continues to fill successfully its
place in the University. The
Guild occupies at Stanford the
place that the infirmary of an
Eastern college fills. Its absolute
need is already conceded. It is of
paramount necessity that its work
shall not be hampered by inade
quate facilities, and in order to
ensure hospital equipment of first
class quality a fund must be raised
at once. The work of the faculty
in presenting a play is praise
worthy. True loyalty will bring
forth good support on the part of
the student body, to which the
coming play should appeal as
much through self-interest as
through the motive of regard for a
University institution that is fill
ing a highly important place.
