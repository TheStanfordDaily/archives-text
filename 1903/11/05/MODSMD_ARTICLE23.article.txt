Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The senior and junior women of
the University are cordially in
vited by the Association of Collegi
ate Alumnae to make use of the
tea-room at 131 Post street, between
Kearny street and Grant avenue,
San Francisco. The room (No. 9)
will be open every week-day, but
on Saturday there will always be
some member of the association
there to pour tea and welcome
guests. There is no charge for the
use of the room, save five cents if
one takes a cup of tea, but it is not
necessary to do even this unless
one wishes, nor does the association
expect it. If no one is in the room
the key can be obtained from the
elevator-man. It is hoped that
senior and junior women will make
free use of the room for rest or to
meet friends whenever they are in
the city. Caroline C. Duniway,
Lois K. Matthews,
for the A. C. A.
