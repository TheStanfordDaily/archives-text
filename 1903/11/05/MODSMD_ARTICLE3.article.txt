The sale of tickets for the big
game continued at the oval box
office this morning. The amount
realized from football and theater
tickets up to the present time
slightly exceeds $2500. No more
rooters' tickets to the game are
available. The sale of theater
tickets was large. There are but
few left of the two hundred seats
reserved for rooters, and the sale
throughout other parts of the house
has been proportionately large. So
far the sale of all tickets compares
very favorably with that of previ
ous years.
Tomorrow morning both theater
and football tickets will be placed
on sale at the Bookstore, where
they will continue to be sold until
Saturday noon. Those that are
unsold at that time will be taken
to San Francisco and placed on
sale to the general public.
