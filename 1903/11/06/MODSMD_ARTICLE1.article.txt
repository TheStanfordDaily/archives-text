# STANFORD VS. MULTNOMAH.
## Last Preliminary Game of the Season to be Played Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Varsity
will line up against the Multno
mah eleven for the last preliminary
game of the season. In many re
spects the contest with the club
men is as important a game as any
except the annual contest with the
State University to be played on
the 14th. The result of tomorrow's
contest will be watched with inter
est among football players over the
state, for if comparative scores offer
any basis upon which to hinge a
guess as to the result of the inter
collegiate struggle, the game with
Multnomah will be doubly impor
tant. Last Saturday California
defeated the clubmen 11-0. With
a week of hard practice which has
been prolific of good results, Stan
ford should be able to surpass this
score. Two weeks ago Stanford
was unable to score on Nevada. It
is expected that Nevada will be
badly defeated by California to
morrow. From the result of these
two games a fairly accurate com
parison as to the respective merits
of the two big elevens may be
drawn.
The line-up that Stanford will
oppose to Multnomah is practically
the same as the one that will face
the Blue and Gold. There is still
uncertainty as to who will be
chosen to play right guard, right
tackle, and right half. More than
one man will be played in each of
these positions, and the showing
the respective candidates make in
this game will have much to do
with their chances of being selected
for the Varsity.
Multnomah will be in better
condition to play Stanford than
she was to meet California last
Saturday. At that time she was
almost wholly without team work,
but a week of signal practice has
helped strengthen the Northern
eleven to a great degree.
Although the Varsity has had
one day of secret practice, in all
probability the plays used in to
morrow's game will be typica 1 of
the straight football that has been
played on the Stanford oval during
the season. As this game is the
last one that will be played on the
campus this season a large crowd
will probably be in attendance.
The Band will be out.
The teams will face each other in
the following order:
