# Baseball Practice.

### 
The baseball practice last night
was faster and more spirited than
any thin fall. The men are being
drilled principally at batting, and
already a marked improvement is
noticeable over the form displayed
at the first practice. Each man is
given his turn at the bat. The
regular number of men appearing
for practice was increased yester
day by the appearance of J. G.
Dehj , '04, L. D. Lock wood, '04, and
M. C. Burr, '07.
