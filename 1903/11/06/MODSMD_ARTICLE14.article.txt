# Basket-ball with California.
## 
### 
The Encina Gymnasium Basket
ball Club has accepted a challenge
from the University of California
basket-ball team for a freshman
game to be played sometime this
.semester. The place and date have
not yet been decided. So far about
ten freshman candidates have
turned out for regular practice on
Tuesdays and Thursdays. This
number will no doubt be increased,
because next week it will probably
be possible to substitute basket-ball
for regular gymnasium work. The
most promising first-year men at
present are G. E. Dole, S. H. Pierce,
R. F. West, G. J. Presley, and M.
M. Stearns. At California some
forty freshmen are out for the
team.
