Tomorrow the football team has
its last game before the final con
test with California. The eleven
will be practically the same that is
to represent Stanford next Satur
day, and the bleachers should be
filled so that the singing and cheer
ing may give an exact idea of the
support that will be accorded in
the final game. It will be one of
the last chances for organized
practice of the rooters, and no one
should remain away. By this
time the singing and cheering
ought to have reached perfection.
In many respects the present sea
son has been one of the best in
years. There has been a feel
ing of complete confidence in
coaches, players, and captain, and
the students have shown their
trust by the hearty support that
they have given. No feeling of in
difference should pervade tomor
row. The cheering ought to be the
best of the year. It should carry
with it a perfect test of the whole
hearted faith that the University
reposes in the players.
