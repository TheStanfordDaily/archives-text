### 
C. H. Baker, '04, captain of the
Tennis Club, states that active
work is going on toward the collec
tion of money to cover the sum un
paid upon the new tennis court,
which amounts to $280. R. C.
Lieb, chairman of the committee
appointed a week ago to get sub
scriptions, has been ill at his home
in San Jose, but the other mem
bers, S. P. Friselle, r O4, and A.
Ames, '06, have been busily en
gaged, and lists have been circu
lated in Encina and elsewhere by
other agents. The collections will
be pressed and every effort made
to secure the necessary amount as
early as possible.
