# MULTNOMAH DEFEATED.
## Last Preliminary Game a Victory for Varsity by Score of 11-0. 
### 
Stanford played her last prelim
inary game with Multnomah Ath
letic Club Saturday afternoon.
The contest resulted in a victory
for the Cardinal by the score of
11-0, and in many ways it may be
characterized as the best exhibition
of football displayed by the team
this year. All of the scoring was
done in the first half, when the su
periority of the Cardinal- was
plainly demonstrated. After a
number of changes in the line-up
the team work of Stanford appar
ently fell off, and during the sec
ond half Multnomah was able to
prevent a score, besides strengthen
ing her offensive play twice in a
way that seriously threatened the
effectiveness of Stanford's defense.
There were three very encourag
ing things displayed in Saturday's
gameâ€”the strong defense of the
Varsity, except at intervals during
the second half; the good team
work on offensive play; and the su
perior manner in which Sprott
punted. On the other hand, the
fact that the backs fumbled twice,
owing to imperfect knowledge of
the signals, contributed to prevent
any feeling of overconfidence be
coming widespread. The score
does not give a correct line on the
respective merits of the two teams.
The superiority of Stanford's offen
sive play should have given her at
least one if not two more touch
downs.
Stanford secured her first score
early in the game. Sprott kicked
off to Multnomah and Cook re
turned the punt, but Stanford
reached Multnomah's ten-yard line
almost at once by a 6eries of fierce
plunges into the line,in which Wel
ler was used to advantage. Here
Stanford lost the ball on downs
and Cook punted fifty yards out of
danger. Almost at once holes in
the clubmen's line were opened
again by Weller, Dole and Chal
mers. With hardly a check the
ball was carried over for a touch
down by Sprott, who added an
other point to the score by kicking
an easy goal.
The second touch-down was
a duplicate of the first. The
three backs were sent into the
line for short dashes past tackle
and between tackle and guard.
The tackles were not used, nor was
there any attempt to circle the
ends; but before the half was
twenty minutes old another touch
down was made. Dole punted out,
but Clark failed to heel the free
catch, so that the Cardinal was de
nied an opportunity to try for
goal. No further score was se
cured. Twice more Stanford was
on the verge of securing a touch
down. Sprott tried a field-goal
from the thirty-five-yard line, but
while the ball went true it fell
about two feet below the cross-bar
of the goal-posts. Once Stanford
carried the ball to within scoring
distance, only to be thrust back for
offside play. The second half was
occupied with a series of plunges
into the line that would give prom
ise of an additional Cardinal score,

when the clubmen would secure
the ball and punt out of danger.
McMillan made a brilliant dash
pastSprott for fifteen yards on a fake
kick in the second half, a play
which the clubmen followed up in
good style by making first down
three times. But Stanford held
and kept the ball from being car
ried within striking distance. The
