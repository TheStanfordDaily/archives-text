The results of Saturday's games
may be regarded either in the light
of encouragement or of apprehen
sion, as one may wish. In one
sense much satisfaction can he
drawn from the first half of the
Stanford game and comparative
scores of the Nevada contest; while
the gravest dangers present them
selves because of the liability that
overconfidence may blind us to the
real significance of California's de
feat by Nevada. Littlestressjsliould
be placed on this, for it must be
considered that the Blue and Gold
eleven outplayed Nevada. This is
not said with any intention of dis
paraging Nevada's victory, but to
sound a note of warning. An evil
threatens the team if the Univer
sity persists in drawing from the
games absolute surety of a Cardinal
victory. It should be the cautious
aim of every student not to over
rate the importance of comparative
scores, lest overconfidence minimize
the good work of the last two weeks.
If there is anything that will com
pletely demoralize a team it is this
overconfidence that the students
themselves are the most potent
factors in infusing into the players.
The situation, then, is peculiarly a
critical one, and calls for the co
operation of every Stanford man.
It would matter very little if
California had been beaten by a
larger score Saturday. The four
teenth will see a veteran eleven
that will be in the best of condition
and prepared to fight as no Califor
nia team has fought before. Both
elevens will typify the spirit of
their rival universities, and not
the least dangerous element that
may contribute to the defeat of
either will be overconfidence.
