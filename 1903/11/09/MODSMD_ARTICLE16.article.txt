Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The new Stanford yell, as adopt
ed at the song-rally November Ist,
is not the Williams College yell, as
reported in the Daily Californian.
All college yells are essentially
alike and, to this extent, is the new
yell plagarized. The Williams
yell was mentioned at the song
rally to contrast its effectiveness
with the utter lack of effectiveness
of the old throat-rasping, unintelli
gible yell that some colleges still
use. A comparison of the Stanford
and Williams yells will show to
what extent they are similar:
Stanford! Stanford!
Rah! Rah!
Stanford!
Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!
Stanford!
Williams! Williams! Williams!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Williams!
A JuNioit.
