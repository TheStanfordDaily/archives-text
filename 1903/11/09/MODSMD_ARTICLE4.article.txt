# Discuss Northern Trip.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Combined
Musical Clubs Saturday night the
northern trip was discussed, and
every member of the club was urged
to write to friends in the different
towns to be visited and arouse in
terest in the concerts. A report
was read stating that the clubs
were sure of a good reception in
Portland. Advance-Agent Edwards
did not arrive in time Saturday to
confer with the different members
at the meeting. Edwards left this
morning for the North to arrange
the itinerary. It is probable that
Baker City, Oregon, and Spokane,
Washington, may be added to the
list if a good attendance can be as
sured at both places. The Com
bined Clubs will probably leave
the campus Friday, December
18th, and give their first concert
that night in Stockton. The men
will return by water from the
North, as was done last year.
