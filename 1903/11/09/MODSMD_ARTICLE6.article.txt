# Chamber Concert Artists.
## 
### 
Mr. Wenzel Kopta, who will ap
pear as the violinist at the Cham
ber Concert Wednesday evening, is
a native of Bohemia and a grad
uate of the Conservatory of Prague.
He first came to this country to
tour in concert with Carlotta Patti,
when his playing attracted great
attention. On his return to Europe
he gave concerts throughout the
continent, traveling with such
great musicians as Weingartner,
Dvorak, and Richard Strauss. Last
year while on his way to Europe
for a visit Mr. Kopta was induced
to play at a concert of the Kalten
born Orchestra, upon which occa
sion he scored a great success.
Since that time his love for his art
has asserted itself very strongly
and he has accepted a limited
number of engagements. As he is
rather wealthy, and has achieved
the highest success as a star, he is
now glad to devote himself to play
ing where he thinks it will do the
most good, and he looks to college
communities as a fertile field. Last
season he played a series of con
certs at Berkeley which were paid
for by Mrs. Hearst.
With two such artists as Miss
Cottlow and Mr. Kopta, the concert
can not fail to be a delightful one,
and when in addition to this we
are to have the assistance of Mr.
Mansfeldt, the celloist, in the great
trio of Rubinstein, it will be seen
that this is to be an event that no
true lover of music can well miss.
