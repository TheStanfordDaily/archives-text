# SUCCESSFUL PRESENTATION.
## Faculty Members and Wives Give Play for Benefit of Students' Guild. 
### 
The six hundred personß who
went to "A Scrap of Paper," given
by members of ihe faculty in As
sembly Hall Friday evening, en
joyed a hearty laugh. The net pro
ceeds of the play, amounting to
something over one hundred dol
lars, will go toward equipping the
operating-room of the Students'
Guild Hopital.
Thecomedy is of light French type.
In the working out of the plot,which
is centered about a billet-doux of
nine lives, there are many amusing
situations and innocent complica
tions, brought about by the varied
characters.
Of the characters, the most com
plex, that of Suzanne, was taken
by Mrs. Matzke, who showed a
reserve power not often found
among amateurs. In her hunt for
the paper with the helter-skelter
Louise as a foil, in the unexpected
interview with the baron, in her
tilts with Prosper, in the gradually
arising consciousness of her love,
there was excellent suiting of action
to word. Mrs. Duniway as Louise,
the baron's wife, was best where
she and Prosper talk over their
love affair of the past. Mrs. Cub
berley as Mathilde, the lovable
sister of Louise, and Mrs. Murray
as Zenobie, acted well their con
trasted parts.
In spite of a slight tendency
toward the rhetorical, which inter
fered somewhat with the natural
ness and ease of the part, Professor
Duniway, as the much-experienced
Prosper, furnished some of the best
amusement of the evening. There
was also good acting by Professor
Allardice, as the frigid, monosyl
labic baron; by Professor Searles,
as the entomologist who used the
sera]) of paper as a beetle-cage; and
by Dr. Snow. '
The minor characters—Mrs. Gil
bert as the housekeeper, Mrs. A. A.
Browne as the maid, and J. P.
Mitchell as Baptiste—helped to
make the play a well-rounded suc
cess. Toward this success no
small part was contributed by the
efficient manner in which the play
was staged under the direction of
Mrs. T. W. Mitchell.
