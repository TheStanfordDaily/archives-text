# Theater After Game.
## 
### 
The regular play, "Rubes" and
"Roses," will be given at Fischer's
Saturday night, but the lines will
he interspersed with local hits.
Cardinal is to prevail in the color
of costumes and decorations. The
chorus in the first act will wear
Stanford sweaters. The actor who
is the object of all the jokes is to
be dressed in blue and gold. The
Glee Club will not appear on the
staue as previously intended.
