The fourth regular meeting of
the Sail Francisco division of the
American Mathematical Society
will he held at the University of
California, December 19th. All
members of the Stanford Mathe
matical department will attend.
The American Mathematical So
ciety is an organization for further
ing mathematical investigation.
The society is divided into three
branches. The main division is lo
cated at New York, and the other
two section at Chicago and San
Francisco. The New York branch
of the society holds its meetings
four times a year at Columbia Uni
versity. The Chicago division

San Francisco society also meets
