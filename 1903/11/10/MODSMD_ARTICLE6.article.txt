# SIGNAL PRACTICE.
## No Scrimmage Work Last Night. Varsity Will Take Trip Friday. 
### 
At last night's secret practice the
Varsity and Second elevens were
put through a long and hard signal
drill. Old and new formations
were tried time and again, in order
to take away the last rough edges.
The last secret practice will be held
Wednesday night, and Thursday
open practice will be held on the
oval. This will probably conclude
the work of the season, for Friday
afternoon the squad will drive out
in the hills back of the University,
in order to be away from the talk
and excitement that always exists
just prior to the big game.
At last night's practice the Var
sity lined up in the following
order: Ends, Smith, Clark; tackles,
Shields, Sprott; guards, Jacobs,
Thompson; center, Hauverman;
quarter, Bansbach; full-back, Wel
ler; half-backs, Dole, Chalmers.
The Varsity men will try out their
new union suits tomorrow after
noon.
