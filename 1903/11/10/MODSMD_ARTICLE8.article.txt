# Gymnasium Cuts.
## 
### 
A new plan of conducting the
Saturday class for making up cuts
will go into effect at Encina gym
nasium this week. Students wish
ing to make up work will report
between 11:15 and 11:30 for registra
tion, and again after the drill hour.
They will be put through a thirty
minute setting-up drill of a rigor
ous order. The intention of the
authorities is to discourage the cut
ting habit as much as possible.
The lists of cuts will appear on the
bulletin-board as before. Hitherto
the Saturday work has been con
ducted as far as possible on exactly
the same lines as on other days.
Registration for the cl >ss has been
required several days in advance,
and temporary sections were organ
ized. The plan failed because of
the neglect of the students to regis
ter in time, and because of their
failure to keep appointments when
made.
