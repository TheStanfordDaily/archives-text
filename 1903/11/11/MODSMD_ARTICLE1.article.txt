# REID AND ANGELL TALK.
## Morning Assembly Given Over to Discussion of Football and Other Athletics. 
### 
W. T. Reid, Jr., assistant master
of Belmont School, and Dr. Frank
Angell, chairman of the faculty
athletic committee, were the speak
ers at this morning's Assembly.
The gathering was unusually large
and enthusiastic. After Dr. An
gell had passed in review certain
recommendations which the faculty
committees will make to the Inter
collegiate Athletic Committee, Ueid
spoke of "The Trials of a Coach."
lie said in part:
"I ask the privilege of talking to
you, not as an outsider, but as one
of you; for certainly I could hardly
be more in sympathy with you if I
were one of you, both because I
know of your spirit and I believe
in the spirit of your coach. You
are now talking about your chances
in the game of Saturday. This is
the time when the coach leads a
wretched existence. He has more
worry than he can look after. He
cannot sleep, he cannot eat, he
cannot rest, for his nerves are all
on edge. The American college
and general public of today de
mands victory of its representa
tives, and demands it with such
pertinacity as almost to crush the
individual upon whose shoulders
the weight of responsibility must
fall.
'The coach is always under the
thoughtless criticism that might as
well be left out. Those who criti
cise and condemn the playing of a
certain man should ask themselves
who is a better man for the place,
and generally they would conclude
that there is no better man. The
coach is likely to play the team
that is going to give most credit to
him, to the University, and to the
men in it. Be careful in the elec
tion of captain and the choice of
coaches, and then stick by them.
It does not matter how the thing
comes out, the coach will have
done his best."
lteid said that attempts to re
spond to the pressure put upon
them had often resulted in unfair
ness on the part of coaches and
teams. He condemned the desire
of some strong partisans to see a
rival university's players injured
before a game. "That," he said,
"is not a big way to look at sport."
Reid took occasion to pay a
warm tribute to the Nevada team
that recently played here. "Neva
da played a hard, fair, clean-cut
game," he said. "That's the kind
of a team we are willing to lose to,
if we have to lose.''
In closing, Reid said: "Let us
see if we cannot gradually strike a
good average between the American
and the English ideals, making our
games more of a sport and less of a
business, less of a matter of life
and death."
Dr. Angell confined his remarks
to a discussion of the recommenda
tions made at the last meeting of
the faculty athletic committees of
Stanford and California.
One suggestion favors holding a
series of freshman football games
for the best two out of three, the
time to be in February. The rea

sons are four: The plan would do
away with the confusion of teach
ing two teams at once, and enable
the coaches to concentrate their
attention upon the Varsity; it
would take the season climatically
best adapted to the sport; it would
train the members of the Varsity
in methods of coaching and fit
them to become better graduate
coaches; and finally it is thought
that in February, after a semester's
experience in college, the freshman
athletes would run less danger of
poor scholarship.
The most important recommen
dation was "that the agreement to
hold all athletic events after this
year on college grounds be adhered
to." These contests should be col
lege events, not commercial enter
prises. They should accommodate
the college community in prefer
ence to the general public. There
is no objection to this plan, but
the advisability of putting it into
effect now is questioned. It is
found that the preparation of the
grounds for a big event would en
tail much expense at this time.
But it is necessary to move to the
new grounds in the rear of the new
Gymnasium, and by 1905 there
should be $8000 in the Training-
House fund. The general passenger
agent of the Southern Pacific as
sures us that in two years his road
will be easily able to handle a
crowd of 12,000 people.
