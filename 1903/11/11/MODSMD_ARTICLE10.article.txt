# Sophomore Comedy Postponed.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Sophomore
Comedy Committee yesterday after
noon the date of presentation of
the play was changed from Decem
ber 10th to January 22d. This ac
tion was found necessary because
of the fact that the previous date
conflicts with examinations and a
number of entertainments taking
place about that time. The date
wii√ü set for the second week after
work begins next semester.
