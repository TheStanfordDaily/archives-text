In a certain sense the rally to
morrow night will close the pre
liminary football season of 1903.
It will mean that the last possible
thing that could bring benefit to
the team has been thought of, tried,
and accomplished. It will show
that the work of preparation is at
an end and that there remains
only the final trial of strength.
Now that the work of coaches and
players is at an end, the students
are given an opportunity to place
the stamp of their approval upon
the season.
