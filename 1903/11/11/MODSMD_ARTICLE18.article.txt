Among the many forces that
have helped the present football
season to stand out prominently
as a successful one the University
Band deserves particular attention.
Its efforts in a sense go unreward
ed, but as a substitute the mem
bers can feel that the University as
a whole appreciates the part the
musicians have occupied in giving
inspiration to the prevailing spirit.
At a great sacrifice of time the
musicians lend their services when
ever called upon. In excellence
and general ability this year's or
ganization surpasses those of other
seasons, and due estimate goes in
dividually and collectively to all
the members. Much of the high
standard can be traced directly to
the capable and efficient leader who
has been in charge for the past two
years.
