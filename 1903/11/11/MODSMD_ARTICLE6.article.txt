# LAST DAYS OF PRACTICE.
## Football Team Goes Through Scrimmage Work Yesterday.â€”Gates Open Tomorrow. 
### 
After light preliminary practice
last night the Varsity squad lined
up for scrimmage work. Three or
four of the first team players were
not put into the heavy work. The
line-up was rather slow, owing to a
considerable amount of time being
devoted to coaching the individual
players between scrimmages.
The last line-up of the season
was held this afternoon. At pres
ent the men are in -good physical
condition, and if no accidents were
sustained today the squad will not
have lost a Varsity man during
the year. Open practice tomorrow
will be of a light character and will
afford the University a last oppor
tunity to see the players in football
uniform before the game.
