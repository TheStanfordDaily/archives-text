# CARNOT DEBATE REGULATIONS.
## Rules Governing the Contest This Year Practically the Same as Heretofore. 
### 
The conditions which will govern
the Camot debate this year have
been, agreed upon by the faculty
committees on debating at Stanford
and the University of California.
In the main the rules are the same
as those which were putin force
last year, when the character of
the debate was changed so as to
make the speeches entirely extem
poraneous.
Three minor changes have been
made in the regulations: Instead
of giving the debaters but one
hour's notice, the specific question
for discussion will be announced at
six o'clock in the evening, thereby
allowing two hours for selection of
sides and preparation of speeches.
In the matter of time each speaker
will be allowed fifteen minutes as
before, with the additional qualifi
cation that each one must divide
his time so that no speech shall be
of less than four minutes' dura
tion.
The debate this year will be held
at the University of California on
the evening of February 6, 1904.
The question, as announced yes
terday, will be the "Judicial Sys
tem of France."
The following are the regulations
governing the contest:
1. The general topic for each
year's discussion shall be chosen
and published before November
15th.
2. The specific question for each
debate shall be announced on the
evening of the debate (the first Fri
day in February) at 6 p.m.
3. Thereupon, each of the six
contestants shall make his own
choice of the side he individually
may wish to advocate. But if it
shall appear that all the represen
tatives of one university have
chosen the same side of the ques
tion, one of them, selected by lot,
shall be required to speak on the
opposite side, in order that at least
one representative of each univer
sity may speak on each side of the
question. The order in which the
contestants shall speak shall then
be determined by lot.
4. Each speaker shall be enti
tled to fifteen minutes in the de
bate. He must use at least four
minutes of this time for his open
ing speech and at least four min
utes for his second or rebuttal
