Much that was Baid by Mr. Reid
yesterday about academic and
athletic courtesy can be applied
very forcibly to the things that
usually happen after the close of
the annual football game. The
Chaparral takes a very commend
able stand in the current issue and
deplores the hat-stealing and the
encounters accompanying the cel
ebration down town, alluding to
the!custon as too preparatory school
like to receive countenance from
college men. If there is one thing
that distinguishes a college man
from others it is his ability to see a
wrong and his desire to correct it
instantly. The stealing of hats is
in itself reprehensible,but the most
glaring feature of the practice is the
personal encounters that ensue
when a hat is captured. Senseless
wrangles and heated discussions
between rival collegians certainly
do not carry a favorable impres
sion of either university to the
hundreds of Easterners and other
visitors who are in San Francisco
at this time. A Stanford man
should be as chary of the reputa
tion and good name of his uni
versity as he is solicitous that vic
tory come to the eleven. Every
violation of gentlemanly conduct
helps to discourage the work that
is being done to strengthen the
feeling between California and
Stanford. We can set the example
by refraining from hat-stealing.
California students will be glad to
reciprocate, and any breech by
either can be minimized by over
looking an opportunity to retaliate.
