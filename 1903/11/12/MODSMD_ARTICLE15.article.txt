Aldenof the English department,
and read at the commencement ex
ercises last May. The beautifully
printed booklet, which will be on
sale at the Bookstore, liaß been
given the brief title, "Consolatio."
In classic lines, full alike of beauty
and of true religious feeling, the
author pictures the alma mater
pressing closer to her heart the
children who remain, yet yearning
for those, who. "sooner than we,"
have gone to "their coming em
pire." If poetry is an expression
of life, this ode may be looked upon
as putting into permanent art
form the experiences of last spring.
