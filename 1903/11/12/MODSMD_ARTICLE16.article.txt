# Good Number of "Sequoia."
## 
### 
In the football number of the
Sequoia are four of the best stories
that have appeared in the magazine
this year. Easily the strongest of
these is "The Friend of the Second
Eleven," by Dane Coolidge, '98,
a tale written in the spirit of the
old days. "Mister Quarter-back's
Mascot," by Miss Christabel Sobey,
'01, reprinted from the Springfield
Republican, is a well written story
of the romantic order. "All's Well
After the Game," by "B. B. B." has
many strong touches. H. A. Moran,
'04, has a well written account of
"How Johnny Made the Team."
In addition, there is a "Review of
the Season," by A. A. Hampson,
'04, and "When the Captain Sends
the Team." a poem by P. C. Ed
wards, *OG. The magazine appears
in an appropriate dress of soft
cardinal matting.
