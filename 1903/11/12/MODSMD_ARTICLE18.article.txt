# CALIFORNIA ELEVEN.
## Team Practically Chosen.â€”Men in Good Condition for Hard Contest. 
### 
The men who will wear the Blue
and Gold Saturday afternoon have
been practically chosen by the
California coaches. The line-men
will be those who have been play
ing as California forwards through
out the season. Stroud at center,
StowandOverall at guards,will con
stitute the center trio who will face
Hauverman, Jacobs, and Thomp
son. At tackles Howard and Heit
muller are easily the best material.
Hudson and Demeritt will be on
the ends. More, California's vet
eran quarter-back, will give the
signals from his old position, and
Mini and Whipple will play the
halves. At the last minute Stern,
whom Force displaced at full-back
earlier in the season, regained his
position and now appears to have
the better chance of appearing in
the initial line-up against Stanford.
The California coaches are much
encouraged over the improvement
the varsity has shown during the
last week of practice. The lethargy
that was apparent earlier in the
season has gone and in its stead
there is a spirit of fight and de
termination. The California eleven
is strong in its line and can rely
on Overall to out-punt his Stanford
opponent, but is weak in the back
field and has shown a dangerous
tendency toward off-side play that
has caused heavy penalties in the
preliminary games. The general
sentiment at California is that the
eleven is a strong one and will win
Saturday's game, although it is
universally recognized that the
Stanford eleven has a good chance
to carry away the victory. -
