"One interesting thing is to note
the position of '04 as a high athletic
class and a probable runner-up if
it make enough points in track and
baseball and possibly a few in foot
ball this senior year. Another re
markable thing is that every four
years Stanford produces a great
athletic class: '95; then '99; then
'03; and it remains for '07 to con
tinue that system, and she has
begun well with a nest-egg of seven
made by Weller."
