# Recital of "Herod" in the Chapel.
## 
### 
November 20th Mrs. Josephine
Rand Rogers will read Stephen
Phillips' drama "Herod." It will
he the only dramatic recital on
the campus this semester. "Herod"
will be the third of Stephen Phil
lips' dramas to have been read to
a Stanford audience. Two years
ago Mrs. Rogers read "Paolo and
Francesca," and last semester Pro
fessor S. H. Clark of the Univer
sity of Chicago recited "Ulysses."
Stephen Phillips has the reputa
tion of having approached nearest
the classical style in drama of any
modern playwright. "Ulysses" is
now being staged at the Garden
Theater in New York. Critics
agree that the play to be read at
Stanford is even better than the
one now being produced in New
York.
Stephen Phillips has sought to
return to the classical spirit of the
drama as characterized by severe
simplicity and tragic interest. Un
like the usual classic dramas, Phil
lips' plays contain a good deal of
humor and some comic situa
tions.
