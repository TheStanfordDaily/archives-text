# SUCCESSFUL CONCERT.
## First of Chamber Series is Attended by Enthusiastic Audience. 
### 
The first of the chamber music
concerts was given last evening in
Assembly Hall beforea fair-sized but
enthusiastic audience. In spite of
the many difficulties encountered
in arranging the affair, and in
spite of the sudden change of date
but a few days before the presenta
tion, everything went very smooth
ly, and the concert is to be looked
upon as a success in every way.
Miss Augusta Cottlow,the young
American pianist, was naturally
the recipient of the greatest atten
tion. Her playing is of a vigor
and strength that one is little pre
pared for when her slight figure is
noted. Her technique is magnifi
cent, both in forte and in piano
passages, while her touch is of a
velvety quality that but few pian
ists acquire. In the andante from
"Kreutzer Sonata," which she
played with Mr. Kopta, there was
in general that suppression of self
that is so essential in ensemble
work. This was also notably the
case in the Rubinstein trio, with
the possible exception of the first
movement, where the piano seemed
perhaps a trifle too powerful. In
her solo numbers Miss Cottlow was
entirely successful. The Chopin
selections were beautifully phrased,
and were played with extreme deli
cacy. The berceuse, by Chopin,
which was played as an encore, was
given with sympathy and simplici
ty. The group of mixed numbers
was also perfectly satisfactory, as
was the "Waldesrauchen" of Liszt,
given as an encore.
Mr. Kopta's violin-pl lying de
served and received a hearty recep
tion. He played with a good tone,
and with fine feeling. His soles
were thoroughly appreciated. The
encore which he gave was a barca
role by Spohr. Mr. Kopta's play
ing in the trio was always ensem
ble, and not solo playing, and this
number was in many respects the
most enjoyable of the evening. The
program as a whole was well
balanced, and of a pleasing length.
