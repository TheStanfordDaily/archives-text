# LAST HARD PRACTICE.
## Wednesday's Scrimmage Work Practically Closes Training for This Season. 
### 
The Varsity and Second elevens
lined up for a few minutes of hard
scrimmage work last night, besides
running through signals for over
an hour. The play was neither so
fast nor so hard as in the earlier
part of the season. The coaches
devoted their entire attention to
drilling the fine points of the game
into the individual players, and as
a result slow playing followed.
The Varsity played together in
first-class shape, but there is still
some hesitancy among the hacks
in grasping some of the signals.
The men on the Second eleven
fought hard to withstand the effec
tive play of the Varsity, but were
steadily pushed back. Last night's
practice seems to have solved the
question as to who will play
against California on Saturday.
Weller is a fixture at full-back, and
Jacobs will probably be played at
guard. Shields will in all proba
bility go in at tackle, although
Monzingo played at that position
in last night's practice. The Var
sity lined up in the following order:
Left end, Clark; left tackle, Sprott;
left guard, Thompson; center,
Hauverman; right guard, Jacobs;
right tackle, Monzingo; right end,
Smith; quarter, Bansbach; full
back, Weller; left half-back, Dole;
right half-back, Chalmers.
The open practice this afternoon
was devoted entirely to signal
work and light individual work.
There will be no further practice
before the big game. Tomorrow
afternoon the team will be taken
for a drive to Woodside and from
then until Saturday afternoon
every attempt will be made to keep
the men quiet and away from
worry.
