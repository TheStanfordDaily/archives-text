Tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
on the Richmond grounds in San
Francisco, Stanford and California
will meet in the most important
atliletic event of the year —the
annual intercollegiate football
match. Never in the history of the
two institutions has the outcome of
the game been harder to predict or
the teams more evenly matched.
The Stanford eleven has finished
its training. The men who will
first enter the struggle have been
chosen, and there remains only the
final decisive test of strength with
the Blue and Gold.
The eleven men who will wear
the cardinal tomorrow make up a
team in which every Stanford man
feels a deep pride. But they are
remarkable not so much for their
individual strength as for the
united power that exceptionally
fine team work gives them. The
eleven is fast, the backs are unusu
ally strong, and the team work is
developed to an extremely high
point. In these respects Stanford
is superior to California, but the
Blue and Gold has several points
upon which to base a claim for
victory. The California line is
composed entirely of heavy veteran
players whose previous experience
should be of great benefit to them
in the final struggle, and in Overall
they possess a punter and place
kicker without a peer on the
Coast.
The choice of officials has caused
entire satisfaction at both univer
sities: Dudley of Yale will umpire
again this year. His work at the
last intercollegiate game was of a
high order. Dibble of Harvard
will referee, and Steckle of Michi
gan, Nevada's head coach, will act
as head linesman and timer. His
assistants will be E. Brown, Cali
fornia '00, and W. H. Blake, Stan
ford '04.
While California opened her foot
ball season with a veteran team
and Stanford began hers with but
a handful of old players, in the
preliminary games the Cardinal
has made much the better showing.
Stanford has not been scored upon
this season, and Nevada scored six
points against California. Each
of the big university elevens has
met almost the same opponents
and Stanford has scored 175 points
against her rivals, while Cal
ifornia has been able to make only
122.

The individual line-up of the
two "elevens appears to be to the
advantage of California in the line
and Stanford in the back-field.
Clark and Smith at ends are recog
nized as superior to Hudson and
Demerrit, who will play against
them. Sprott can be depended
upon to more than hold his own
against Heitmuller, California's
right tackle, but Howard, a sea
soned line man, should be able to
out-play Shields, whose inexperi
ence makes right tackle a question
able place in the Cardinal line.
Of the two guards, Thompson,
•Stafford's beet maji, will oppose
Overall, who is rated as the best
football player on the Coast. Thomp
son has been playing a fine, con
sistent game throughout the season
and should be able to keep Overall
busy tomorrow. Jacobs at right
guard is light, and has never had
varsity experience, while Stow, his
opponent, is a veteran player with
an enviable record. At center,
Hauverman is opposed to Stroud,
who outweighs him by twenty-four
pounds, but while this weight may
tell in the end, Hauverman is a
quick and aggressive player who
made an excellent showing against
Stroud in the last intercollegiate
match. Behind the line the super
iority is beyond a doubt with Stan
ford. Bansbach at quarter has a
better record than More, who will
play the same position for Califor
nia. Dole and Chalmers are strong
line-plunging halves, while Mini
and Whipple can be used to ad
vantage in end runs only, and
Whipple is so slow as to be practi
cally worthless on the defense. At
full-back Weller will be a tower of
strength for Stanford if he does not
forget his coaching and play too
high. Stern of California is a
player of only ordinary ability.
Each eleven has almost a full
complement of substitutes, but
should Thompson, Hauverman, or
Sprott be forced to leave the game,
their loss would be an almost ir
reparable one for Stanford. The
weakest feature of the Stanford
team is the kicking. Sprott, who
is inclined to be erratic, is opposed
to Overall, the strongest and surest
kicker in the West.
It is the universal opinion of
coaches, players, and Stanford par
tisans, that the speed and team
work, together with the effective
