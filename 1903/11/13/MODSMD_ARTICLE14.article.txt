# Arrangements Completed.
## 
### 
The team and twelve substitutes,
coaches, and trainer, will go to San
Francisco in the morning on the
train leaving Palo Alto at 9:27.
From the Third and Townsend
street depot they will go direct to
the Stanford headquarters at the
Palace Hotel, where they will re
main until 1:30, when a special car
will carry them to the Richmond
grounds. The California and
Stanford teams will appear on the
field about 2:50. Play begins at
3:00. The gates to the grounds
will open at 1 o'clock. A bout sixty
student ushers will seat the crowds.
The seatingcapacity of the bleachers
is about 11,500, and standing room
for 3500 additional is provided.
In all probability the crowd this
year will nearly equal that of
1900, when the biggest attendance
in the history of the intercollegiate
contests was present.
At the close of the game the pos
session of the field will go to the
winning side. Win or lose, the
Stanford students will meet the
band at the City Hall and march
down Market street to the Palace
Hotel.
