# Fischer's Theater Program.
## 
### 
After the game the Stanford root
ers will have Fischer's theater for
their celebration, while the Califor
nia students will go to the Alhatn
bra, where the regular play will
give way to a farce by the students.
"Rubea" and "Hoses" is the regular
travesty now running at Fischer's,
and this will be given with the
lines changed to allow many local
hits and joshes. The chorus in the
first act will appear in Stanford
sweaters, while the actor who is the
object of all the jokes will be
dressed in blue and gold. Blake,
the comedian, is to sing "The
Cardinal Song," lvolb and Dill
will give the "Bum Song," and in
addition parodies on California
and Stanford songs are to he given.
Local hits will be interspersed
throughout the lines, and the color
effects are to be distinctly cardinal.
The rooting section of two hundred
seats is located in the center of the
lower floor, while the team will
occupy the boxes. The Glee Club
also will be in a box.
