# RALLY IN ASSEMBLY HALL.
## Many Speakers Praise Personnel of the Team—Lanagan on Prospects. 
### 
The final football rally held in
Assembly Hall last night was at
tended by about seventeen hundred
persons. The entry of the team
was the signal for a scene of great
enthusiasm. As the men, Captain
Bansbach at their head, walked
down the center aisle, every man
and woman rose and cheered for
fully a minute.
Dr. Jordan, in making the intro
ductory speech, paid high tribute to
the character of the team. The
personnel was better, he declared,
than it had ever been before.
Professor Duniway followed Dr.
Jordan with a general talk on foot
ball experiences, and then Professor
Lewers spoke of the team's pros
pects. He said: "In this year's
team every man may have a large
amount of confidence. But we have
one of the hardest battles in our
history to win on Saturday. We
go in better prepared than ever be
fore."
Coach Lanagan was given the
heartiest reception of the evening,
and the audience rose and cheered
for several seconds. Lanagan said :
"I thank the student body for its
stand toward the team this year.
Every man in college has been back
of it. If there has been any knock
ing I have not heard it. We appre
ciate your support, and on Satur
day we will try to give you some
return for it. When the Freshmen
stepped on the field in San Fran
cisco 1 felt absolutely confident that
they would win, and every man on
the team knew that we could win.
Saturday we are going to win if we
can, and lose if we have to. There
is not a man on the team who will
not do his best."
Assistant Coach Slaker was not
present. Trainer Moulton said
"This is the best trained team that
I have ever been with in my life.
I have been under many good
coaches, but I have never been bet
ter satisfied with one than with the
present one, Mr. Lanagan. The
team has been taught team work.
You wilL see a game very different
from any of the contests in recent
years. Give us a dry field and a
square deal all round, and the
Cardinal will be there."
A. C. • Whitaker, '99, and Dr.
Frank Angell closed the speech
making, and the men then took
part in a serpentine around a mass
of red fire in the inner quad.
