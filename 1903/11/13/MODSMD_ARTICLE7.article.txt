The season of 1903 is practically
over, and that it will end success
fully no Stanford man has the
least doubt. Dr. Jordan struck
the keynote last night when he
said that the team deserves to win.
In many respects the eleven is the
best that has ever represented
Stanford, not because it is the
surest, fastest, and best-trained
team that has met California, but
because it represents in the fullest
degree those elements of spirit and
loyalty that every Stanford man
longs to see in every team that
wears the cardinal. It is not much
to say that we hope for victory.
What the hearts of all are filled
with at the present time if* antici
pation of victory. We expect the
eleven to be successful, because it
is a Stanford team, composed of
eleven Stanford men who are de
termined to add credit to their
University. The utmost confidence
is reposed in the team. No misgiv
ings are present. No one questions
the fighting spirit of a single man.
Victory is expected, because every
body believes that the team is
capable of defeating California. If
perchance defeat comes, we are
going to be just as proud of the
eleven. We will know that they
have done their best, and that best
will be such as to carry to the vic
tors an enviable pride. California
is a worthy opponent, and in ca.«e
she wins the Stanford team and
students can feel that they were
defeated because their opponents
were a better team. To the men
on the Second eleven the Univer
sity owes a debt of gratitude. Their
splendid loyalty, whole-souled
spirit, enduring energy, and fight
ing perseverance have been so
laudable as to win the .enthusiastic
commendation of every student.
Without their efforts, which in a
sense go unrewarded, the Varsity
could not have had the excellent

practice that has contributed so
much to perfecting the admirable
condition of the team. The Uni
versity appreciates their efforts, and
puts the greatest faith in them if
chance places them in the contest.
