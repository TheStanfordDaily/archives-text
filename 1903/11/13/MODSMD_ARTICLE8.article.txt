# Football "Chaparral" Out.
## 
### 
The football number of the
Chaparral made its appearance to
day. The issue is decidedly super
ior to its predecessors of the year.
The editorials have a characteris
tic swing and spirit, although the
magazine has retrograded into its
traditional controversy with the
Sequoia. The art supplement by
B. C. Bubb, '04, is a full-page draw
ing of Bansbach in football clothes.
The verse is unusually plentiful
and above the average in quality.
The issue comes out in the new
cover that has been announced for
some time. In general beauty and
attractiveness it is such as to de
serve continuance.
