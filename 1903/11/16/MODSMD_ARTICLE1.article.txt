# CALIFORNIA 6, STANFORD 6.
## Brilliant and Hard Fought Intercollegiate Game on Richmond Field Saturday Afternoon Ends in a Tie Score. 
### 
The thirteenth intercollegiate
game ended in a tie, 6-6, although
in every respect except the score
Stanford cannot hut feel that she
won an unquestioned victory.
Stanford scored five points on a
beautiful run hy Captain Banshach
from the middle of the field, behind
magnificent interference. Sprott
kicked an easy goal. California
tied the score in the second half hy
blocking a kick. Heitmuller broke
through Sprott, who, after playing
a wonderful game, had been weak
ened and almost driven out of his
head by the repeated hammering
of the California backs. Dole was
called behind the line to make his
first kick of the game, and when
Heitmuller broke through the ball
fell behind the line, where the big
California tackle fell on it, scoring
a touchdown for his eleven. Over
all kicked the goal, which tied the
score. Despite desperate efforts hy
both sides and several chances each
team obtained to score, neither
eleven was able to convert the tie
into a victory. Hut as far as the
actual playing is concerned, Stan
ford did work superior in every
respect to that of California. The
Stanford line held the California
backs time after time, and on
offense this same light line opened
holes through which Weller and
Dole in particular plunged for good
gains. In kicking, Overall was
forced to do his utmost to offstand
the gains made by Sprott and
Dole, although throughout the first
half Stanford was forced to kick
but three times, as the backs were
able to make first down repeatedly.
And in generalship Bansbach
proved himself the superior of
More. Bansbach's run, which gave
Stanford her first touchdown for
five years, was due as much to the
generalship on his part that had
taken California off her guard as
to the execution of the play, while
More allowed two opportunities to
kick a goal from placement to Blip
by unused.
The superior team work of the
Cardinal eleven was an unqualified
surprise to the California rooters,
who saw a veteran eleven outplayed
by a lighter and less experienced
set of men. With the exception of
Hud son, California's right end, the
Stanford forwards outplayed their
respective opponents, holding more
strongly on defense, and opening
better holes on offensive plays. He
hind the line the first set of backs
used by California were unques
tionably inferior to the Stanford
backfield, and it was not until
Force and Snedigar displaced Stern
and Whipple that the Blue and
Gold was able to penetrate the
Stanford line.
So good was the individual play
ing of the Stanford eleven that it is
difficult to single out the men most
remarkable for the brilliancy of
their play. Sprott, left tackle, un

til he was exhausted by his hard
play, was the superior of any man
in either line, lie was tried ten
tunes by the California backs for a
total gain of but five yards. On
offen√üe he was all over the field. He
put More out of the play when he
was the only man between Bans
bach and a touchnown. Weller,
although his inexperience was
apparent to the bleachers, played a
wonderful game. His great strength
and determined way of hitting the
line were productive of good gains
for Stanford. Clark at end was
invincible, and besides his line
bucking abilities Dole was invalu
able in punting after Sprott was
obliged to give up that part of the
game. For California Hudson,
Mini, Snedigar, and Overall played
the best.
In past years a certain amount
of dissatisfaction has been felt at
the work of the officials. Dudley
of Yale and Dibble of Harvard
kept a wonderful control over the
game. Their decisions were given
without hesitancy, and after Cali
fornia, who was the chief offender,
had been penalized several times
for offside play her forwards were
more careful in this respect.
Neither man would commit him
self as to the merits of the game
and which side deserved a victory,
but both men called the game an
even one, well played and interest
ing. But the Stanford coaches and
players were universally dissatis
fied that the game had been left in
so undecided a state. Coach Lan
agan considered that the Stanford
team excelled the California eleven
in every point of the game. He
was disappointed that the game
was a tie when he felt that victory
should have come to Stanford. The
captain likewise was confident of
the team's superiority and felt that
fortune had been with the Blue and
Gold when she was enabled to tie
the score. California's coaches ex
pressed themselves as surprised at
the showing of the Stanford eleven,
particularly at the consistency
with which the light Stanford line
held the California backs. But
they felt that the game should have
gone to California.
The Play in Detail.
Stanford won the toss and Sprott
kicked off to Overall, who ran the
ball in to the twenty-five-yard line.
California made two yards in two
downs, and on the first series of
plays the strength of the Stanford
line became apparent. Overall
was forced to kick, and Stanford
got the ball in the center of the
field. Stanford gained ten yards
on plunges into the line, and Cali
fornia was penalized fifteen yards
for three offside plays. Stanford
fumbled on the twenty-five-yard
line, and after California had failed
to gain through Jacobs and around
Clark's end, Overall punted to
Stanford's twenty-five-yard line.

California was given the hall on a
foul, but was penalized twenty-five
yards on the next play for holding
in the line. Overall kicked to
Chalmers on the twenty-five-yard
line. Then began the series of
plays that ended in a touchdown
by Stanford. Dole and Weller
were sent through the line for first
down, and Weller, Dole, and Chal
mers were worked in sequence for
short dashes into the California
line. The ball was carried to
within five yards of the middle of
the field and then Bansbach gave
the signal for the quarter-back run.
Clark and Sprott gave him perfect
interference and he carried the ball
over the line for a touchdown.
Sprott kicked the goal, and the
score was 6-0 in favor of Stanford.
Overall kicked off to Chalmers,
who ran the ball in to Stanford's
twenty-five-yard line. Stanford
lost the ball on downs, and then
held California for downs and re
gained possession of the ball.
Sprott kicked forty yards, and Dole
was downed without gain on the
twenty-five-yard line when Overall
returned the punt. After making
the required five yards once, Stan
ford was penalized for holding in
the line and given the possession
of the ball on her fifteen-yard line.
She failed to gain and Sprott was
sent back to punt. The ball was
fumbled and Sprott fell on it two
yards from the goal-line. With
only two yards to gain and three
downs in which to make them, Cal
ifornia made a yard on her second
down and fumbled on the next
play. Stanford punted out of dan
ger, and after each side had lost
the ball on downs the half closed
with the ball on Stanford's twenty
five-yard line in California's pos
session.
California scored not long after
the opening of the second half.
Overall kicked off to Chalmers, who
was downed on the ten-yard line.
Sprott punted, and California was
forced to surrender the ball on
downs on the twenty-five-yard
line. After a punting duel between
Overall and Sprott, California tried
a place-kick by Overall, but it
passed to one side of the goal-post.
Stanford kicked out from the
twenty-five-yard line, and Mini
was downed. Overall fumbled the
ball on a fake kick, but California
regained possession on a fumble by
Chalmers. Overall punted over
the heads of the Stanford backs,
who got possession of the ball on
the two-yard line. Stanford failed
to gain, and Dole fell behind the
line to try his first punt of the
game. Heitmuller broke through
and blocked the kick, falling on
the ball behind the line for a
touchdown. Overall kicked an
easy goal, making the score 6-6.
The game then resolved itself into
a punting contest between Overall
of California and Dole of Stanford.
Sprott kicked off to Overall, who
ran the ball in to the thirty-five
yard line. Mini and Snedigar
failed to gain in running the Stan
ford ends, and Overall punted.
California interfered with a fair
catch and was heavily penalized.
Stanford was given possession of
the ball on California's thirty-five
yard line, with a free kick for goal.

Sprott was too weak to send the
ball over, and Stanford lost her
last chaiTce to score. Overall
punted to Chalmers, and Dole re
turned to Mini. The failure of
Dole and Bansbach to play far
enough hack in the field allowed
Overall to punt over their heads
for forty-five yards. Stanford
could not buck the California line,
so Dole returned with a forty-yard
kick. Snedigar gained twice on
dashes at the end, and then Over
all punted to Dole. On the next
exchange Overall gained twenty
yards from Dole and California
was in striking distance of the
Stanford goal, but Dole kicked out
of danger, sending the ball sixty
yards down the field over the head
of Mini, who was playing in the
backfield. California tried two
plays, but failed to make her dis
tance, and Overall punted to the
center of the field. Time was called
with the ball in Stanford's posses
sion nearly in the middle of the
field.
