Rev. J. Wilbur Chapman, a well
known Presbyterian pastor of New
York, delivered the morning ser
mon Sunday in Memorial Church.

of the forty-fifth Psalm: "All thy
garments smell of myrrh, and
aloes, and cassia; out of the ivory
palaces." The sermon was evan
gelical in tone and most delicate in
its delineation of Christ, the savior
of men. The large congregation
was moved by the fervor of the
preacher and the personal charac
ter of his appeals. —A t the after noon
organ recital Chaplain Gardner
spoke on "Christ, the light of the
world."
