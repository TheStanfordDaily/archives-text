# Hospital Operating-Room.
## 
### 
An operating-room, consisting of
a preparation-room and the operat
ing-room proper, has been added to
the Guild Hospital. The room has
been furnished in white enamel
paint so that it may be thoroughly
sterilized and disinfected. A sub
stantial and serviceable operating
table of the same quality used in
all hospitals has been ordered.
The necessary stands for instru
ments and dressings, a wheel
stretcher, and steam and hot-air
sterilizers, one for instruments and
one for gowns and linen, have also
been provided for. The sterilizers
are to be lliere this week, but the
operating-table will not arrive for
three or four weeks.
The object of adding an operat
ing-room is to do away with the
serious results which often follow
the removal to San Francisco of
patients requiring an operation.
It is not the intention of the Guild
to make a business of operating
on patients here instead of taking
them to Sin Francisco, but rather
to have a room for emergency
cases. Minor operations will be
performed by local physicians,
while for the more serious ones a
surgeon will be called from San
Francisco.
The total expense of furnishing
the room will be about $175, to
wards which the net proceeds of
the faculty farce have been paid.
The running expenses of the hospi
tal are just being met by the stu
dent Guild fees and the patients'
fee of one dollar a day.
