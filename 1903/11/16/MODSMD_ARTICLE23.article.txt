# Sale of Horses.
## 
### 
Fifty-two horses were shipped
Saturday from the Stock Farm to
New York. The sale will take
place at Madison Square Garden
immediately after the National
Horse Show, which will begin about
November 21st. The shipment is in
charge of Superintendent Covey.
A few horses are still on the farm,
but they will be disposed of in
January. Mendocino, the son of
Electioneer, is physically unfit to
stand the trip to New York and
will be sold privately at the farm.
After the January sale only a few
noted old brood mares will be left.
Most of them are very old and will
be cared for until their death. In
the future the farm will be devoted
to agriculture exclusively.
Most of the yearlings to be sold
at the New York sale are entered
in all of the rich futurity stakes of
the country. This fact greatly en
hances their value. Monbells,
youngest son of the famous mare
Beautiful Bells, will probably bring
the highest price at the sale. Aer
olite, half-sister of Arion, cham
pion two-year-old trotter, is one of
the best animals in the consign
ments.
