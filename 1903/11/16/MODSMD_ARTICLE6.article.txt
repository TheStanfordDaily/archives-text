Stanford has 110 reason to feel
permanent disappointment over
the outcome of Saturday's game.
Victory was well within eight, and
it is natural that momentary re
gret should he experienced over the
tie score. But in the general out
come of the season, when the handi
caps of the early year are taken into
consideration, a wholesome victory
has been won. Considering the
fact that the beginning of the sea
son found the most hopeful wonder
ing how big the score against the
team would be, it is hard to con
ceive how success could have been
expected. The efficiency of the
coaches, the faithful and energetic
work of the players, and the gen
eral spirit of the students made
victory seem possible. The season
can be taken as one of the most
successful in years. The results of
the splendid work will be seen next
year, when the present outlook
points to a highly successful sea
son. Both California and Stan
ford may well feel proud of their
teams. Every player added honor
to hie institution. We owe a debt
of many thanks to our coaches,
trainer, players, and captain.
They have typified that spirit
which is distinctly Stanford.
The men played as every
body knew they would, and
the University feels just as
proud of them as if actual victory
had come. A harder fought, closer
contested, and more sportsmanlike
game has seldom been played on the
Coast. Particularly gratifying was
the admirable action of both stu
dent bodies in remaining upon the
bleachers at the end. Intercollegi
ate contests have received a puri
fying benefit whose results are hard
to measure.
