# CELEBRATE FOOTBALL SEASON
## Large Crowd at Bonfire Rally Cheers Team, Coaches, and Players. 
### 
Several hundred students gath
ered 011 tht) haselntll field last night
to express their appreciation of the
showing made by the eleven in
Saturday's game. After dancing
around the huge bonfire to music
furnished by the Band, the crowd
went to the bleachers, where they
engaged in singing and yelling,
and listened to speeches by the
men who have been identified with
football throughout the season.
The celebration as a whole was
characterized by the absence of that
enthusiasm which prevails after a
victory. The spirit shown, how
ever, was one which in every way
exemplified the feeling of all
Stanford partisans that, while the
score resulted in a tie, the members
of the team had shown themselves
to be deserving of victory. Each
member of the team was cheered as
he appeared before the bleachers.
The first speaker was Professor
Lewers. He said in part: "We
have not assembled here tonight to
celebrate a tie, for that Stanford
will never do. We are here to
show our appreciation of the team
and coaches. There never was a
Stanford team that more deserved
to win than this one, and none
that more deserved our pride.
"It has been said that both scores
were made by chance. I do not
take this view of it. They were
both made by good, straight foot
ball. It was not an accident that
Heitmuller broke through the line
and fell on the ball for a touch
down, nor was it an accident that
Bansbach made his beautiful run."
Trainer Moulton said bethought
that California was very lucky to
score. He praised the members of
the Varsity and the Second team.
The fact that we have a fine Second
team, together with the good
coaching this year, makes football
prospects for next season very
bright.
The next speaker was Captain
Bansbach, who said: "I do not care
to make a speech, but simply to
praise Lanagan, Slaker, and Moul
ton. 'Dad' had us in the finest
possible condition, and the coaches
did the rest. I want to praise the
work of every man on the team;
and I think if we had had a dry
field we would have won by two
touchdowns."
The individual players were
called on in turn, and all expressed
their appreciation of the sterling
worth of Lanagan as a coach. After
the end of the speeches the crowd
serpentined around the bonfire.
