# WILL BUY SHELLS
## Boat Club Arranging' to Hold Class Regattas on Lagunita in May. 
### 
The Stanford Boat Club is ar
ranging to buy two double-oared
sheila for use on Lagunita. Theee
will probably be ready for use
about February Ist, so that prac
tice for the class regattas can begin
as soon as the lake has sufficient
water. It is planned to have the
regattas on Memorial Day, which
comes on May 14th, though this
date is not definitely chosen for the
races.
The course for the regatta lias
already been laid out. It is in the
shape of an 'L' and the distance to
be coverd is four-fifths of a mile.
The starting point will be near the
boat-house. The first turning-stake,
or the apex of the 'L,' will be
placed in the southeast corner of
the lake. The second stake, or one
end of the 'L,' will be fixed in the
southwest arm of the lake. At this
point the boats will turn and go
back over the same course, thus
making the start and finish of the
race in full view of the spectators.
On the course there will be two
stakes at each turn, one for each
shell, so that danger of collision
will be avoided.
Daily practice for the races will
commence early next semester, and
the hours for rowing have been
fixed from 4:30 to 6 daily except
Sunday. The old barge used last
year will be devoted to the training
of new men. As they show improve
ment,, the candidates will be put
into the shells.
