The recent changes in the regu
lations governing the Car not debate
will <he effective in eliminating the
objectionable features of last year's
contest. The rule requiring that
no speech shall be less than four
minutes' duration is the most salu
tary of the alterations. In an
extemporaneous debate a desire is
naturally prevalent among the
speakers to shorten their opening
talks, but the present rules will
avoid a repetition of this objection
able feature of previous contests.
The change which allows two hours
for selection of side 6 and for
thought on the question is also an
improvement over the one-hour
plan of last year. A notice of two
hours on the specific {issue to be
discussed is not great enough to
interfere with the extemporaneous
character of the debate, but on the
other hand it will be the cause of
more clearly arranged and more
logical speeches. The practical
close of the football season brings
the attention of the students to the
prominent field that debating
holds in the University. While
the distinction that a successful
debating team brings to its institu
tion is not so greatias is earned by
athletic victories, the general wide
spread influence that debating has
in the University is not well appre
ciated. A victory in debating car
ries abroad the potent force of uni
versity training. Forensic con
tests stand for a phase of college in
terest radically different from ath
letic meets, but their value to the
University is in every way just as
far-reaching. Almost no other
branch of college work calls for
so much sacrifice of time, so much
perseverance, so much labor, and
such universal information, and its
value to those participating is im
measurably great.
