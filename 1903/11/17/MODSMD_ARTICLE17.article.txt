# Success of College Men.

Mr. A. Lawrence Lowell, for
merly a lecturer at Harvard, is the
author of an article entitled "Col
lege Rank and Distinction in Life"
printed in the October Atlantic
Monthly. He bases his remarks on
the latest edition of "Who's Who."
Among other things he says:
"The total number of men who
graduated from Harvard College
during the twenty-eeven years,
1861-87, was four thousand and
eleven, of whom three hundred and
one, or one in thirteen and three
tenths, are named in 'Who's
Who.' The chance, therefore,
that the average graduate will at
tain the distinction that this im
plies is one in thirteen and three
tenths.
"If now we turn to the high
scholars, and take the men who
graduated in the first seventh of
their classes during the same per
iod, we find that they number five
hundred and seventy-three, of
whom eighty-two are in 'Who's
Who'; so that their chance of dis
tinction is a trifle better than one
iri seven, or nearly twice as great
as that of the average graduate.
One would naturally suppose that
the chance of the very highest
scholars would be better still, and
so in fact it is. Out of the first
twenty-seven scholars there are
seven, or more than one in four, in
'Who's Who.'
"But after all, the scholar is not
the only type of man of mark in
college. The athlete is a far more
prominent figure. What is the re
lation between his fame in college
and his distinction in after life?
Take first the crews: We find that
during the twenty-seven years from
1861 to 1887 they comprised eighty
two different men, of whom six, or
one in thirteen and two-thirds, are
in 'Who's Who.' This, it will be
observed, is very nearly the same
as the proportion for the total
graduates of the college during the
same period, and it has remained
fairly constant throughout. Dur
ing the eighteen years from 1870 to
1887 there were seventy-two play
ers in the baseball nine, of whom
only one is in 'Who's Who.' The
contrast is very surprising. The
record of the football team tells
much the same story. From 1874
through 18S7 there were ninety
three members of the eleven, of
whom three, or one out of thirty
one, are found in 'Who's Who';
while of the seven captains, not one
appears in that work."
