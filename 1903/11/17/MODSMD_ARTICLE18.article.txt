# Campus Fire System.
## 
### 
Several changes have been made
in the fire system on the campus,
and the publication of the fire
signals with the location of hose
carts and hydrants will prove of
interest to the residents of the cam
pus. Fire alarms will be blown
from the steam whistle at the
boiler-house as follows: One whis
tle, quadrangle; two, cottages;
three, Encina Hall; four, Ruble
Hall; five, LCncinagymnasium; six,
lloble gymnasium; seven, Running
Farm near College Terrace; eight,
Stock Farm.
The hose-carts are located as
follows: One back of Prof. W. R.
Dudley's residence, 9 Alvarado
row; two in power-house; one
between lloble Hall and gymna
sium. Fire hydrants are located
at convenient places thoughout
the campus. Encina Hall is pro
tected by four plugsâ€”two in front
and two in the rear. Four hy
drants at lloble Hall are similarly
located.
The Encina gymnasium man
agement has decided to institute a
series of fire drills.' Each section
of all the classes will have one
drill this semester, and the same
work will be repeated next year.
On the ringing of a special fire
alarm in the gymnasium, three
designated sections will respond to
the call. One of the hose-carts
will be taken out, the hose unreeled
and attached to the hydrant. As
an incentive to speed the sections
will be timed and a record of the
performances will be kept. This
work has been adopted by the
gymnasium authorities more for
its practical good to the community
than the physical benefits to be
derived from the practice.
