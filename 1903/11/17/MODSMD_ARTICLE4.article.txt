# BEGIN PRACTICE THURSDAY.
## Football Squad to Do Only Light Work for Los Angeles Game. 
### 
The next interesting event in
football is the game to be played
by the Stanford Varsity in Los
Angeles Thanksgiving day. It is
still undecided who will be the op
ponents of the Cardinal in the
southern game. At present Pomo
na College holds the Southern Cal
ifornia championship, but she has
yet to play the Perris Indians, who
are her most formidable rival. The
victors in the Pomona-Indian con
test will meet Stanford, and in
case the southern teams play a tie
game, it is probable that Stanford
will play them both. In that case
one game would occur on Thanks
giving day and the other the fol
lowing Saturday.
The Varsity will resume daily
practice Thursday afternoon.
This will continue until Tuesday,
when the team will leave for Los
Angeles. Practice will consist of
running through signals and for
mations and handling punts. No
attempt will be made at scrimmage
practice, and the players will not
be required to observe training reg
ulations. Fifteen players will be
accompanied on the trip by the
athletic manager and trainer.
It is uncertain as to whether all
the first team players will go on
the trip, but for the most part the
line-up will be practically the
same as that which faced Califor
nia.
No step toward the election of a
football captain for next year has
as yet been made, and one will
probably not be chosen until the
holiday games have been played.
The captain will be elected by the
twelve men who entered the inter
collegiate game on Saturday.
Plans for awarding the Quad
rangle Club punting cup are soon
to be formulated. The trophy is a
silver one offered by the Quadran
gle Club last January to the foot
ball player who should make the
greatest development in punting
during the year. At Columbia and
Harvard universities a similar
award is made annually to the
punter who makes the highest av
erage in a formal tournament.
