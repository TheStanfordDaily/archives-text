# OUTLOOK AT CALIFORNIA
## The 						Blue and Gold Will Lose Six Men of This Year's Varsity. 
### 
When the California football
squad makes its first appearance
on the football oval next season, in
all probability six men who played
with the Blue and Gold this year
will be absent. Overall and Stow,
the two veteran guards, Hudson,
end, More, quarter-back, and Mini
and Whipple, half-backs, are not
expected to play football at Cali
fornia again. The varsity men who
will return are Stroud, center,
Heitmuller and Howard, tackles,
Demerritt, end, and Stern, full-back.
Force, substitute full-back, and
Snedigar.who took Whipple's place
in the intercollegiate match, will
both return. As there will be a
dearth of heavy linemen next sea
son, Force will probably be played
at tackle, and Heitmuller shifted
to guard. For the other side of the
line, Gray, a second eleven man,
has a good chance at guard, and on
end Oliver will lead the race with
half a dozen men giving him a
good fight.
Belnap, who was considered near
ly as good a man as More, will be
tried at quarter again, and Stern
should be able to make full-back.
Butjthe California back-field will be
weak next season, for Whipple and
Mini will not return. This places
the race for the two halves among
Kittrelle, Muther, Risley, and
Kern, captain of the 1907 eleven.
Although California will not
have the veteran eleven with which
she opened this football season, her
material for next year is average
in quantity and of exceptionally
good quality. On the second eleven
are several players who will be
dangerous varsity possibilities after
another season of coaching.
The loss of Overall will be severe
ly felt by California for she has
been depending 011 him for several
seasons to do her punting. Neither
Stow nor More, both of whom have
acted thoughout the season as
Overall's substitutes in the kicking
game, will be back. California
will have to face next season the
question of developing a strong
back-field and filling at least three
places in the line, and at the same
time she will be forced to develop a
punter and place-kicker.
