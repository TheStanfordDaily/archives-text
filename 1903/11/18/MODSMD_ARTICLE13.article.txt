Success of fall training will
depend a good deal on the outcome
of the handicap field-meet Satur
day. About sixty men signed for
work at the call issued some time
ago, and nearly all of these will
participate Saturday. The effect
iveness of preliminary training
was seen in the success of the track
team last year, and with indica
tions pointing to a victory in the
spring much headway has been
gained already by the squad. This
meet will be one of the last campus
athletic events of the semester, and
every student should do all in his
power to pave the way for a quick
and successful start of the regular
season in January. No admission
will l)e charged Saturday, and
barring other reasons the bleachers
ought to be filled, so that every
possible encouragement can be
given the candidates.
