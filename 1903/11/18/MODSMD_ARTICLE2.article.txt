# BRILLIANT OUTLOOK.
## Stanford Will Have Much Seasoned Football Material Next Year. 
### 
The season of 1904 should open
under very encouraging prospects
for Stanford. Of the Varsity and
Second Team men who showed up
well during the last season but two
or three will not he back nextyear.
Jacobs, who played such a gritty
game at guard throughout the sea
son and showed up to the best ad
vantage in the intercollegiate game,
will be lost through graduation.
Hauverman, the veteran center,
may not return next year, although
there is a possibility that he may
be back for another season. Ex
cept for these two men there is a
reasonable certainty that all of the
Varsity players and most all of the
Second Eleven men will be back in
college.
Stanford will be strongest behind
the line again next season. Bans
bach, Weller, Chalmers, and Dole
may all be expected to claim again
the positions they held this year.
But Stott, Freshman quarter-back,
Scholfield, substitute full-back, and
Brennan and Tarpey, halves, will
certainly make an interesting fight
for these places. There is also a
possibility that Magee, who played
on hist year's Varsity, may return.
The ends may not remain un
changed. Although Smith and
Clark will both return the presence
of Stephenson, who played such a
brilliant game on the Freshman
eleven, and the return of Bartell,
end on last year's Varsity, may

force Smith from his place at right
end. Shields and Sprott appear to
be the logical candidates for Var
sity tackles next year, although
Buttertield and Stillman will make
the fight a close one.
The center trio will be as much
a problem next season as it proved
to be this one. Should Hauver
man not return the fight for center
will be among Nissen, center on
the Second Eleven, Hyde, who tried
out for guard this year, and Molfi
no, the Freshman center. Thomp
son will be sure of a place at guard,
and the other guard's place will
afford the most interesting fight of
the season. Van Sickle, Hyde,
and Monzingo, all Second Eleven
men, will try out, and in addition
Roosevelt, guard on the 1901 Var
sity, who was severely injured in
the game with Michigan that sea
son, will appear on the football
field again.
There is a great deal of veteran
material from which the coaches
may draw for an eleven. At this
early date it appears as though
Stanford will be better supplied
with prospective Varsity men than
at any other time for a period of
years.
The coaches will not be con
fronted with the same problems
they were forced to face this year.
A definite system has been under
taken and work can begin next
year almost where it ceased this
season. The necessity of relying
upon team work and not upon in
dividual playing has become a
principle of football at Stanford,
and there are two men, Sprott and
Dole, who should develop into
more than ordinary punters next
season. Should Stanford have as
successful a season next year as she
did this year, with the material
now at hand there is no reason why
the 1904 Varsity should not be one
of the best in the history of the
college.
