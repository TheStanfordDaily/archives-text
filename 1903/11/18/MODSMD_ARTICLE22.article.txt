# POWERS OF COMMITTEES.
## Functions of Various Debating Organizations in the University Explained. 
### 
Much confusion exists as to the
function and jurisdiction of the
various debating societies, clubs,
and committees in the University.
Their powers have appeared indefi
nite, and the presence of the same
men in several organizations has
added to the difficulty of getting a
clear understanding of the matters.
For this reason the executive
committee of the Intersociety De
dating League is preparing a con
stitution specifying the powers and
duties of that body.
The Intersociety Debating League
is made up of all members of Eu
phronia, Nestoria, the Saturday
Night Club, and the San Jose Col
legiate Debating Society. It acts
through a president and a secre
tary elected at large, and an execu
tive committee made up of three
delegates from each debating soci
ety. It has powers of general super
vision over matters of debating
within the University. It appoints
judges and conducts try-outs and
class debates.
The University Debating Club
was organized last year in response
to a demand for a body which
could assume charge of intercollegi
ate debating, and decide upon mat
ters of general policy. Its mem
bership is limited to students and
faculty members who have taken
part in intercollegiate debates. It
has power to submit and accept
questions, and to choose sides.
Election of the Intercollegiate De
bating Committee is made from
this body.
The Intercollegiate Debating
Committee is made up of three
members. It is an executive body,
empowered to act as official repre
sentative of the University in all
negotiations with other institutions
concerning debating.
The power to declare a debate an
intercollegiate event, and to appro
priate funds to defray expenses of
debating interests, is reserved to the
Executive Committee of the Asso
ciated Students. A standing com
mittee of the faculty appointed by
the President of the University has
advisory control of all debating in
terests. Representatives of this
committee meet with the members
of a similar body at the University
of California to facilitate negotia
tions between the two universities.
