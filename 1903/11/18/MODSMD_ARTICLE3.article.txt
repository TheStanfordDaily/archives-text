Four fraternities, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Sigma Nu, Chi Psi, and
Zeta Psi, are the first to enter
football teams in the contest of the
Greek-letter societies for supremacy
in football. These fraternities will
play games next Saturday after
noon, S. A. E. vs. Sigma Nu, and
Chi Psi vs. Zeta Psi. Two short
halves of probably fifteen minutes
each will be played, and the two
games will take place but a short
interval apart. All Varsity foot
ball players are barred from the
teams. Other fraternities will
probably enter the tournament.
The games are to be played on the
football oval.
