# BASEBALL PRACTICE.
## Little Interest Manifested.â€”Discouraging Outlook for Next Season's Team. 
### 
For the first time within a week
regular fall practice was resumed
on the diamond yesterday after
noon. In spite of the fact that
only two afternoons each week are
devoted to regular practice, the
number of men who worked out
under Captain Ball's directions last
night was exceptionally small. [The
fact that the baseball materia] at
present in college is very meagre
was evinced beyond a doubt by the
handful of men who appeared in
suits.
Captain Ball devoted the entire
practice to sharp fielding work and
trials at the bat. None of the new
men showed up strongly at the bat,
and at present the outlook appears
that Stanford will have another
weak hitting team. But in the
field several of the men who played
on last year's class teams are show
ing up to advantage.
After the unsuccessful season last
spring the Varsity squad was prac
tically demoralized by the loss of a
number of its players, so that there
are several vacancies on the nine.
Captain Ball will probably play
behind the bat unless some new
man who can fill that position ap
pears, in which case Hall will go to
third base. Tritch, Roosevelt, and
Sales will fight for the pitcher's
position, and Blake of the 1902
nine may try again for first base.
Williams, if he returns to college,
will be a strong candidate for
second, and Crawford will (ill the
short-stop's position in a satisfac
tory manner. Stott, the Freshman
quarter-back, is looked upon as a
possibility as a catcher, and should
Captain Ball no to third, there will
be left on I}' the three positions in
the field to fill. Wirt and Trow
bridge, both Varsity men, should
fill two of them unless Trowbridge
tries for the infield, probably at first
base. In that case two green men

will have to be developed into out
fielders.
The greatest problem that the
captain and coach will have to face
will be to teach the men to bat.
For the past three years there has
not been a heavy batting team at
Stanford, and unless the present
players can be taught this feature
of the game their chances of suc
cess against California are but
small.
The Freshman material that has
putin an appearance up to date is
of ordinary quality and very email
in quantity. The prospects for a
good Freshman team next spring
do not seem to be very bright.
