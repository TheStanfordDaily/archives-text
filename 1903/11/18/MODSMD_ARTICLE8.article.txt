# PREPARING FOR MEET.
## Indications Point to a Large Entry List in Saturday's Field â€“ Day 
### 
Although all the entries for the
field-day to be held 011 the oval
Saturday morning are not in, indi
cations point to the participation
in the meet of nearly everyone who
intends to try for the track team
next spring. A large number of
men were on the track yesterday
and today.
Workmen are busy repairing the
runways and track, and unless it
rains very hard before Saturday
they will be in first-class condition.
The high hurdles will not be run,
but the hurdlers will be given a
chance in a 120-yard low hurdle
race.
Although not in regular training,
most of those who will compete are
in fair condition, and the short
ened distances will give each man
a chance to do his best without fear
of injury.
The number of weight men in
college has been increased consid
erably, and several new men with
good preparatory school records are
entered in the sprints and jumps.
No admission to the meet will be
charged. A good attendance will
do much to encourage the men who
are entering University track ath
letics for the first time.
