# PLANS FOR CLUB-HOUSE.
## Alumni Association of San Francisco Will Attempt to Procure Permanent Home. 
### 
At the alumni smoker held at
the Cafe Odeon in San Francisco
the night before the intercollegiate
game serious plans were advanced
for the procurement of a perma
nent home. For several years the
alumni of San Francisco have
been strong enough to hold occa
sional smokers and more formal
reunions, but their numerical
strength has never been great
enough to allow the undertaking
of more heavy financial burdens.
J. T. Nourse, '00, president of the
association, took occasion at the
recent smoker to place before the
large number of representative
alumni in attendance a plan for
securing a suite of rooms that the
association can call its own.
Many strong arguments in favor
of taking this step were advanced
by the different speakers of the
evening. Dr. J. B. Frankenheimer,
'96, George Crothers, '95, W\ H.
Harrelson, '95, spoke enthusiasti
cially in favor of the plan as out
lined by Nourse. His idea is to
start at first with simple and un
pretentious quarters where the
alumni can find a place to drop in
while down town and which may
serve as a lounging place for the
undergraduates when in San Fran
cisco. It is planned to provide
daily papers and periodicals as the
basis of a more pretentious library.
The main point to the scheme is
that the alumni and undergradu
ates may be brought in closer
touch. President Nourse has ap
pointed a committee of three to
look more closely into the practi
cability of the plan.
It was decidedly the sentiment
of those present that the smoker
on the eve of the intercollegiate
football game be made an annual
affair, and should the club secure
permanent quarters their rooms will
undoubtedly be made the scene of
these informal meetings.
