# TELLS OF PIONEER DAYS.
## Dr. Jordan Talks of the Earliest History of Stanford University. 
### 
The meeting of the English Club
at the Kappa Alpha Theta house
last night was marked by a notable
address by Dr. Jordan. In accord
ance with the plan of the club to
preserve in manuscript the story of
pioneer days of the University,
Dr. Jordan has been preparing a
paper dealing with the very earliest
history of the college. Last night
he presented to the club in a gen
eral way the contents of this paper.
He told how he had first heard of
the new University that was being
founded in California by Senator
Stanford, and how he came to be
selected as its president. Andrew
Dickson White was originally
chosen and accepted on condition
that Dr. Jordan be appointed vice
president and practically carry the
detail work of the institution. Sen
ator Stanford believed that if Dr.
Jordan was to be the chief worker,
he might as well be the president
in fact, and, with Dr. White's
approval, he was appointed to take
full charge of the new Western
institution. Dr. Jordan was then
president of the University of Indi
ana.
Dr. Jordan told in an interesting
way of the men he tried to get
when he was securing a faculty.
Many could not come; others
would not. He also said a few
words about the men who did come
—the pioneer members of the
teaching staff. Dr. Jordan spoke
of the dark predictions of the Uni
versity of California people at a
banquet that marked the beginning
of the new college. The State Uni
versity men said there was no room
for another university in Califor
nia. There were only 150 men
prepared for college every year in
the whole state, and the new insti
tution would find itself a univer
sity without students. The fallacy
of this view was shown when 400
students flocked to the University
upon the opening of its doors. Dr.
Jordan also spoke of the Pioneer
Class and its doings, and told how
the professors lived in the first
months of the University.
