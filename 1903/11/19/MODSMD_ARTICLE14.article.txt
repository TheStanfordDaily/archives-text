The suggestion that comes from
California about a new system of
coaching need not go unapplied at
Stanford. In-fact the plan of hav
ing a regular coaching board has
been talked of before at Stanford
and has met with considerable
favor. The general opinion seems
to be that it is too herculean a task
for one man to shoulder the respon
sibility of drilling football into a
squad of from fifty to sixty men.
When the graduate system was
adopted, one of the objections was
that there were not enough avail
able alumni to be called upon. The
force of this was seen last year,
when the position of head coach
necessarily remained vacant be
cause of the inability to find a man
to fill it. At Yale and Harvard no
less than ten or twelve different
coaches are on the field during the
closing days of the season. The
aim in adopting a coaching board
system at California is to attain
gradually that condition of affairs.
The change will not only mean a
wonderful step toward the improve
ment of football on the Coast, but
it will make it reasonably certain
that there will be no dearth of
coaching material in occasional
years. The interest of the alumni
will be maintained, since they are
to feel that {their presence on the
field is not intrusion and that their
services are valued. It is reason
ably certain that the scheme can
not be putin force at Stanford in
the near future, because at the
present time the list of graduates
available to coach is exceedingly
meager. Nevertheless, such a plan
must ultimately come into use here,
if continuous success in football is
to be looked for.
