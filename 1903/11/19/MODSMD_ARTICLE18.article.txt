# NEW SYSTEM AT CALIFORNIA.
## Coaching Board May Direct Football at State University Next Season. 
### 
At the last meeting of the execu
tive committee of the associated
students of the University of Cali
fornia, Colonel Edwards, chairman
of the faculty committee on ath
letics, advanced a plan for football
coaching at California next season.
In his opinion the present system
of relying entirely upon the foot
hall knowledge and executive abil
ity of one or two graduates to
control the destinies of a football
squad numbering between fifty and
sixty men is utterly inadequate.
Colonel Edwards did not wish to
reflect upon the work of Whipple
and Hall, who coached at California
this season, but expressed himself
as strongly in favor of establishing
a permanent system at the univer
sity.
His plan is practically a replica
of the scheme followed at Yale and
HarvaH. An alumnus is chosen
as beau couch and is given super
visory control over the work of the
assistant coaches and the players.
Under him a small number of
veterans of former years are ex
pected to work without remuner
ation, devoting especial attention
to the individual work of the re
spective players. While the chief
executive functions will be placed
in the hands of the head coach, a
coaching board will have supervis
ion over the adoption of a system
of play and over the main features
of the season.
The personnel of the board was
suggested by Colonel Edwards as
follows: Head coach, sub-coach, a
faculty representative, an alumnus,
and one or two others to be chosen
at the discretion of the executive
committee. While the plan is still
far from perfected and has not
been accepted at California, it has
been enthusiastically greeted by
the football players and those who
follow the game most closely, as
affording a solution of the present
unsatisfactory system of graduate
coaching. Under the new system
it is expected that a definite plan of
play will be chosen and followed
year after year, so that the work
of one season may serve as prepara
tion for the work of the following
year.
Whether or not the system will
be tried at Stanford next year, or
even in the more distant future, is
very questionable. Thesame prop
osition has been agitated more
than once in the past, but it has
been the consensus of opinion that
it is impracticable. The fatal ob
jection at once presents itself that
it is almost impossible to secure
the services of old players to assist
in the coaching. Almost without
exception the men who have made
reputations for themselves as foot
ball players at Stanford are so

widely scattered that it is practi
cally impossible to secure their as
sistance in coaching the eleven.
Head Coach Lanagan expressed
himself as heartily in favor of the
plan in the main principle?. The
presence of the old Varsity players
to lend their assistance in direct
ing the coaching of the individual
players would be of the greatest
help, he thought. The advisory
board, with the head coach as its
executive head, by choosing a par
ticular style of play to which all
the assistant coaches would con
form, would obviate the possibility
of conflict in the work of the sub
coaches. Lanagan considered that
the main objection to the plan lies
in the practical impossibility of se
curing the presence of the old play
ers at the times when they are
wanted.
Captain Bansbach was also in
favor of the plan and thought that
it would be of great benefit to Cali
fornia if thatlcollegeadopted it. The
fact that these men who have been
so closely identified with the past
season believe the plan to be a
good one will probably do much
toward starting a movement for the
adoption of a similar plan at Stan
ford within the near future.
