# Mrs. Rogers' Reading.
## 
### 
Tomorrow evening at 7:80 Mrs.
Josephine Rand Rogers will read
Stephen Phillips' "Herod" in the
University chapel, and an invita
tion has been extended to all to
attend. This will be her second ap
pearance before a Stanford audi
ence, and in view of the flattering
comments which were called forth
by her presentation of "Paola and
Francesca" last year, there will
probably be a large attendance.
Mrs. Rogers is the wife of Profes
sor F. J. Rogers of the Department
of Physics. Two j'ears ago she ap
peared in several of the large cities
of the East, where testimony was
given to her natural charm of man
ner and her high power of dramatic
interpretation.
Organist Arthur Scott Brook will
assist Mrs. Rogers, and Miss Grace
Clark of Palo Alto will play the
following numbers on the piano:
Polonaise in C sharp minor
Chopin
Witches' Dance McDowell
Hark! the Lark!.. . .Schubert-Liszt
