# Nevada to Play Washington.
## 
### 
Football interest in the North
west is at present centered in the
game to he played in Seattle
tomorrow between the University
of Washington and the University
of Nevada teams. Washington has
defeated the University of Oregon
and other minor elevens, and now
claims the championship of the
Northwest. Many people in Neva
da, Oregon, and Washington are of
the opinion that Nevada has the
California-Nevada championship,
from her showing against Califor
nia and Stanford, and are looking
to the game in Seattle to decide the
Coast championship.
The game will no doubt go to
Nevada. She has had superior
coaching, her experience is far
greater, and her team is five
pounds heavier to the man than
that of Washington.
