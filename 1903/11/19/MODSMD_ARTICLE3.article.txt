# PROSPECTS FOR TRACK.
## Large Number of Entries for Saturday Give Promise of Successful Season. 
### 
Prospects for a good meet on the
oval Saturday morning are excel
lent. The fair weather which
prevailed during the first part of
the week brought out a great
many track aspirants, and Trainer
Moulton is particularly pleased
with the abundance of new mater
ial which has lately appeared.
Weller will probably not run the
hurdles this year. His absence
leaves a big gap to be filled. Two
new men, Leonard, '07, and Mac
farland, '07, give promise of mak
ing good hurdlers. As Moulton
considers the hurdles a weak place
in the Varsity track team, he will
pay particular attention to the
men who try for these events.
The dashes will be participated
in this year by an exceptional lot
of good men. Luce, '04, a member
of the '01 track team, is again in
college. Turpin, '06, is showing up
finely in the 100- and 220-yard
dashes. Wood, '07, of the Sacra
mento high school, is a 100-yard
man with a record of 10 2-5. Other
likely men who√üe records are not
so well known are out for the
short dashes. The 440-yard dash
will be represented again by Dunn,
'04, and Grossman, '04, who have
won points in that event for the
past two years. \V. 11. Dole, '05,
who was on the relay team last
year, will be among the 440-yard
entries. Kennedy, '07, and Ste
phenson, '07, have good records in
the 440.
Stanford does not lose any
weight men this year, and several
promising Freshmen are putting
the shot and throwing the hammer
on the oval every night. Bell, '05,
and Ball, '06, are the only old men
entered in the high jump, but sev
eral new candidates will make
competition keen for places in that
event.
A large number of entries have
been made for the half-mile, and
the committee will have a hard
time handicapping the participants.
Thomson, '04, who ran such a
brilliant race in the intercollegiate
field-day last spring, will be scratch
man. Henley, '06, Russell, '06,
and Smith, '05, have done good
work in the half-mile. True, '07,
and Ladd, '07, are new students
with good preparatory school
records. They will go in the half
mile event.
W. E. Dole, '04, Porter, '06, and
Beach, '04, are the only ones who
have signified their intention of
trying for the pole-vault. Dole is
vaulting higher now than he did
at the beginning of the spring
training season last year.
The only old men of experience
entered for the mile are Gay, '04,
and Fowler, '04. Holman, '04,
who won the mile in last spring's
intercollegiate meet, hns not yet
returned to college,but will be back
next semester.
No new candidates are entered
for the broad jump. Weller, '06,
Ball, '06, and West, '06, will par
ticipate in this event Saturday.
Barrett, '04, who ran a good race
in the two-mile run last spring, is

the only representative of the '03
team entered in that event. H. H.
Smith, a graduate student from the
University of Wisconsin, is entered.
He is a very fast man in his event,
but the one-year residence rule
bars him from participation in the
intercollegiate field-meet next
spring.
