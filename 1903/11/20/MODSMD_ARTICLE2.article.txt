# THE
						HONOR SYSTEM.
## Explanation of Princeton Method, Where Students Deal with Cheating in Examinations.

[In connection with the editorial
in today's issue, the following arti-
I cle on "The Honor System at
i Princeton," is reprinted from an
'early issue of Harpers' Weekly.]
; The present method of conduct
-1 ing examinations at Princeton was
| inaugurated in January, 1893. Just
! before the mid-vear examinations,
in response to the strong desire of
the college, the faculty decided to
abandon the old plan of watching
; students, and resolved to put them
j on their honor. In accordance
[ with their wish, it was also voted
j that each student be required to
! sign at the end of his paper a
pledge stating that he had neither
! given nor received assistance in the
examination. It was also agreed
that instructors were to avoid even
the appearance of watching stu
dents. The examiner was to be
present solely for the purposes of
presiding and answering the neces
sary questions, but was to be free
to leave the room at any time. The
only restraints to be put upon the
freedom of the students were such
as were necessary to preserve the
decorum of the examination. They
i also were free to leave the room
| and to communicate with one an
i other.
The result was very interesting.
! Cheating vanished from the exami
| nations of the senior and junior
classes as if by magic, and from
i then till now but a single case of it
in these classes has been known.
Three or four sophomores had the
temerity to brave the frowns and
warnings of their neighbors, and
cheated openly and somewhat defi
antly, while a number of freshmen
cheated shamelessly. The indig
nation of the college was aroused
| at once. There was an imrnedi ite
j call for a mass-meeting, and one
| day, before the examinations were
half over, there gathered in the
| Old Chapel the most thoroughly
I stirred and determined body of
i undergraduates that ever met on
the Princeton campus. No athletic
meeting ever equalled it. The
meeting decreed that any student
mean enough to cheat when put
j upon his honor was no fit man for
Princeton, and must go. it ap-
I pointed a characteristic student
i committee, of which the leader of
the Glee Club was chairman, and
football and baseball men and
I other students of strong personality
and pluck were the members, with
instructions to summon witnesses
and gather what evidence it could
respecting the students charged by
campus rumor with cheating, to
confront these students with the
evidence against them, and to deal
adequately with every man of
whose guilt there was no question.
The committee discharged its
difficult and delicate duty with
| magnificent fidelitj' and great dis
cretion. After careful deliberation
it very wisely decided that time
enough had not elapsed for the col
lege freely to realize the honor
j principle in examinations, and
j that it would be fairest—especially
' as the culprits were all under-class

men —to give any man who chose
to take it the chance to save him
self by confessing his guilt to the
examiners under whom he cheated,
and taking another examination.
It was its unanimous decision that
thereafter but one penalty could be
considered—a recommendation to
the faculty of dismission from col
lege.
The committee was able to get
evidence enough to convict two
sophomores and two of the guilty
freshmen, and all of these but one,
a sophomore, availed themse Ives
of the privilege of confessing to
their examiners. Against certain
other freshmen, of whose guilt it was
convinced, the committee could not
get sufficient evidence, because their
friends leagued together to shield
them. One man plucky enough to
testify was for a time ostracized by
his former club-mates. It is an
interesting fact that most of these
men soon disappeared from college.
The remaining sophomore—a
man who had cheated in almost
every examination he had taken,
and against whom the evidence
was conclusive—was defiant. He
denied the jurisdiction of the com
mittee, refused to submit to trial,
and set himself at work among his
friends to stir up revolt against
the new order of things. The little
mutiny was of short duration. A
committee of fifty juniors waited on
the would-be mutineers one night
and nothing further was heard
from them. The feeling against
the guilty sophomore meanwhile
was becoming intense, and threats
were frequent that if he did not
soon disappear of his own motion,
his traps would be thrown into a
mule-cart and he be drummed out
of town after it to the tune of the
"Rogue's March." He appealed to
the facult}', asserting his innocence
most brazenly. The student com
mittee at once presented its evi
dence, withholding only the names
of the witnesses. The faculty con
sidered it and the defense of the
accused man very carefully, was
satisfied of his guilt, and promptly
required him to leave college.
Since those memorable examina
tions in January and February,
1893, cheating has been compara
tively unknown at Princeton.
At the June examinations of
that same year a freshman copied
from the papers of a classmate
without his connivance or knowl
edge. The examiner noticed the
correspondence between the papers
of the two men, and had no diffi
culty in determining which of them
was guilty, and in seeing that the
other was guiltless of giving assist
ance. By the advice of the faculty
he laid his evidence before the stu
dent committee. The guilty man
was summoned, admitted his guilt,
and was told that if he returned in
the fall the faculty would be asked
to dismiss him from college. He
did not return. Twice only since
then have indications of cheating
been noticed in papers handed in
by students. In each instance the
evidence was put into the hands of
the student committee, who found
one of the men accused innocent,
the other guilty. The guilty man
was dismissed from college.
