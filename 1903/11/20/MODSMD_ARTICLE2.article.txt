# THE 						HONOR SYSTEM.
## Explanation of Princeton Method, Where Students Deal with Cheating in Examinations.

; The present method of conduct
-1 ing examinations at Princeton was
| inaugurated in January, 1893. Just
! before the mid-vear examinations,
in response to the strong desire of
the college, the faculty decided to
abandon the old plan of watching
; students, and resolved to put them
j on their honor. In accordance
[ with their wish, it was also voted
j that each student be required to
! sign at the end of his paper a
pledge stating that he had neither
! given nor received assistance in the
examination. It was also agreed
that instructors were to avoid even
the appearance of watching stu
dents. The examiner was to be
present solely for the purposes of
presiding and answering the neces
sary questions, but was to be free
to leave the room at any time. The
only restraints to be put upon the
freedom of the students were such
as were necessary to preserve the
decorum of the examination. They
i also were free to leave the room
| and to communicate with one an
i other.
The result was very interesting.
! Cheating vanished from the exami
| nations of the senior and junior
classes as if by magic, and from
i then till now but a single case of it
in these classes has been known.
Three or four sophomores had the
temerity to brave the frowns and
warnings of their neighbors, and
cheated openly and somewhat defi
antly, while a number of freshmen
cheated shamelessly. The indig
nation of the college was aroused
| at once. There was an imrnedi ite
j call for a mass-meeting, and one
| day, before the examinations were
half over, there gathered in the
| Old Chapel the most thoroughly
I stirred and determined body of
i undergraduates that ever met on
the Princeton campus. No athletic
meeting ever equalled it. The
meeting decreed that any student
mean enough to cheat when put
j upon his honor was no fit man for
Princeton, and must go. it ap-
I pointed a characteristic student
i committee, of which the leader of
the Glee Club was chairman, and
football and baseball men and
I other students of strong personality
and pluck were the members, with
instructions to summon witnesses
and gather what evidence it could
respecting the students charged by
campus rumor with cheating, to
confront these students with the
evidence against them, and to deal
adequately with every man of
whose guilt there was no question.
The committee discharged its
difficult and delicate duty with
| magnificent fidelitj' and great dis
cretion. After careful deliberation
it very wisely decided that time
enough had not elapsed for the col
lege freely to realize the honor
j principle in examinations, and
j that it would be fairest—especially
' as the culprits were all under-class

men —to give any man who chose
to take it the chance to save him
self by confessing his guilt to the
examiners under whom he cheated,
and taking another examination.
It was its unanimous decision that
thereafter but one penalty could be
considered—a recommendation to
the faculty of dismission from col
lege.
The committee was able to get
evidence enough to convict two
sophomores and two of the guilty
freshmen, and all of these but one,
a sophomore, availed themse Ives
of the privilege of confessing to
their examiners. Against certain
other freshmen, of whose guilt it was
convinced, the committee could not
get sufficient evidence, because their
friends leagued together to shield
them. One man plucky enough to
testify was for a time ostracized by
his former club-mates. It is an
interesting fact that most of these
men soon disappeared from college.
The remaining sophomore—a
man who had cheated in almost
every examination he had taken,
and against whom the evidence
was conclusive—was defiant. He
denied the jurisdiction of the com
mittee, refused to submit to trial,
and set himself at work among his
friends to stir up revolt against
the new order of things. The little
mutiny was of short duration. A
committee of fifty juniors waited on
the would-be mutineers one night
and nothing further was heard
from them. The feeling against
the guilty sophomore meanwhile
was becoming intense, and threats
were frequent that if he did not
soon disappear of his own motion,
his traps would be thrown into a
mule-cart and he be drummed out
of town after it to the tune of the
"Rogue's March." He appealed to
the facult}', asserting his innocence
most brazenly. The student com
mittee at once presented its evi
dence, withholding only the names
of the witnesses. The faculty con
sidered it and the defense of the
accused man very carefully, was
satisfied of his guilt, and promptly
required him to leave college.
Since those memorable examina
tions in January and February,
1893, cheating has been compara
tively unknown at Princeton.
At the June examinations of
that same year a freshman copied
from the papers of a classmate
without his connivance or knowl
edge. The examiner noticed the
correspondence between the papers
of the two men, and had no diffi
culty in determining which of them
was guilty, and in seeing that the
other was guiltless of giving assist
ance. By the advice of the faculty
he laid his evidence before the stu
dent committee. The guilty man
was summoned, admitted his guilt,
and was told that if he returned in
the fall the faculty would be asked
to dismiss him from college. He
did not return. Twice only since
then have indications of cheating
been noticed in papers handed in
by students. In each instance the
evidence was put into the hands of
the student committee, who found
one of the men accused innocent,
the other guilty. The guilty man
was dismissed from college.
In the mid-year examination of
1894 two students were proved
guilty of cheating—a senior and a
freshman. The committee recom
mended that the senior be dis
missed from college,and the faculty
acted in accordance with the com
mittee's recommendation; but the
freshman was allowed to confess
his guilt to the examiner and take a
new examination,on theground that
he had not been long enough in
Princeton to realize what Princeton
honor meant. This senior was the
only upper-classman against whom
there has ever been even a suspicion
of cheating since the honor system
went into operation. He had the
temerity to return for class-day,
and was ostracised by his class
mates for his pains.
No case of cheating was reported
at the examination in June last,
but four cases, all under-classmen,
came before the committee after
the recent February examinations.
One of the four was acquitted, the
remaining three convicted. It was
recommended to the faculty, with a
presentation of the evidences, as in
previous cases, that the one who
was a freshman should, in consid
eration of that fact, be merely sus
pended, but that the others be dis
missed, unless they chose to with
draw of their own accord within
one week. They withdrew at once.
The last two cases illustrate
strikingly the high standard set by
the student committee. Neither
man had handed in the portion of
his work which was dishonest.
Each had been detected using a
crib by one of his neighbors, and
had seen that he was detected.
The one had thereupon handed in
a blank paper, and the other a
paper from which the dishonest
work had carefully been eraced,
and from which the pledge was
absent. Hut when examined by
the committee, both were forced to
admit that detection alone had
prevented the dishonest work going
in to the examiner, and the judg
ment of the committee, since then
unanimously endorsed by a mass
meeting of the collegp, was that,
except in the case of a freshman,
under the honor system cheating
in examinations, in whatever
degree, whether it consisted in
giving or in receiving assistance,
was a capital offence, for which
there was no adequate penalty
short of final separation from the
college. A culprit whose offense
was not particularly heinous was
to have the privilege of withdraw
ing without formal vote of dismis
sal by the faculty, but leniency
was to go no further.

The original student body
committee disbanded after act
ing on cases of cheating which
it had been appointed to
investigate. Since then there;
has heen no permanent com
mittee, but the presidents of the
four undergraduate classes" have
served as a committee when occa
sion for investigation and action
has arisen. Their work has uni
formly been characterized by the
utmost care, discretion and fair
ness. The mode of procedure is
the simplest possible: The wit
nesses against the accused student
are first heard. The accused is
then summoned, and after the evi
dence against him lias been read,
allowed to make his statement and
to present witnesses for his defence.
The case is then decided in accord
ance with the evidence.
There was a strong feeling at the
outset against trammeling the
movement with unnecessary ma
chinery, and a conviction that time
and experience would evolve the
best mode of administering it. But j
the system has grown into such i
definite form that it is possible to
embody it in a written constitution.
The need of such a constitution has
come to be felt, and accordingly
one was adopted at a mass-meeting
of the college held May Ist of the
present year. The purpose of the
constitution, as stated iifthe pream
ble, is "in order to preserve the
high standard of honor recognized
by the establishment of the Honor
System in examination, to regulate
the procedure and organization of
an undergraduate committee of in
vestigation and punishment, and
to insure its continuous and uni
form action." The constitution is
a very complete document, provid
ing for a regular committee, a fixed
mode of procedure, and permanent
records. The penalty provided for
all violations of the "Honor Sys
tem," except those of freshmen, is a
recommendation to the faculty of
final separation from college, "with
the addition, in extreme cases, of
publication to a mass-meeting of
the college." For freshmen the
penalty is to be "a recommendation
of suspension for a time determined
by the committee."
The movement haR been char
acterized throughout by much dig
nit}' and a freedom from sensa
tional features, and on that ac
count it has attracted little notice
since its inauguration in 1893.
The first news of its success, how
ever, aroused a great deal of inter
est among the students of other
colleges, and the various under
graduate journals at once took up
the question. The students of
Wesleyan University introduced
the Princeton plan. The Amherst
Student urged that the new "Prince
ton system" be tried at Amherst.
The Cornell Era asserted that "a
similar change in the method of
conducting examinations should be
welcomed by Cornell students."
The Harvard Advocate character
ized the Princeton movement as
"better than twenty victories at
football," and the Yale Cow-ant
said, "Princeton is to be congratu
lated on the step she has taken,
I and we wish that Yale might be
theffirst to follow her." Such is
the history of the Princeton
students for honor in examina
tions —a movement which has only
gained strength with time, and
which has established the "Honor
System" as one of the permanent
institutions of Princeton.

are first heard. The accused is
then summoned, and after the evi
dence against him lias been read,
allowed to make his statement and
to present witnesses for his defence.
The case is then decided in accord
ance with the evidence.
There was a strong feeling at the
outset against trammeling the
movement with unnecessary ma
chinery, and a conviction that time
and experience would evolve the
best mode of administering it. But j
the system has grown into such i
definite form that it is possible to
embody it in a written constitution.
The need of such a constitution has
come to be felt, and accordingly
one was adopted at a mass-meeting
of the college held May Ist of the
present year. The purpose of the
constitution, as stated iifthe pream
ble, is "in order to preserve the
high standard of honor recognized
by the establishment of the Honor
System in examination, to regulate
the procedure and organization of
an undergraduate committee of in
vestigation and punishment, and
to insure its continuous and uni
form action." The constitution is
a very complete document, provid
ing for a regular committee, a fixed
mode of procedure, and permanent
records. The penalty provided for
all violations of the "Honor Sys
tem," except those of freshmen, is a
recommendation to the faculty of
final separation from college, "with
the addition, in extreme cases, of
publication to a mass-meeting of
the college." For freshmen the
penalty is to be "a recommendation
of suspension for a time determined
by the committee."
The movement haR been char
acterized throughout by much dig
nit}' and a freedom from sensa
tional features, and on that ac
count it has attracted little notice
since its inauguration in 1893.
The first news of its success, how
ever, aroused a great deal of inter
est among the students of other
colleges, and the various under
graduate journals at once took up
the question. The students of
Wesleyan University introduced
the Princeton plan. The Amherst
Student urged that the new "Prince
ton system" be tried at Amherst.
The Cornell Era asserted that "a
similar change in the method of
conducting examinations should be
welcomed by Cornell students."
The Harvard Advocate character
ized the Princeton movement as
"better than twenty victories at
football," and the Yale Cow-ant
said, "Princeton is to be congratu
lated on the step she has taken,
I and we wish that Yale might be
theffirst to follow her." Such is
the history of the Princeton
students for honor in examina
tions —a movement which has only
gained strength with time, and
which has established the "Honor
System" as one of the permanent
institutions of Princeton.

; The present method of conduct
-1 ing examinations at Princeton was
| inaugurated in January, 1893. Just
! before the mid-vear examinations,
in response to the strong desire of
the college, the faculty decided to
abandon the old plan of watching
; students, and resolved to put them
j on their honor. In accordance
[ with their wish, it was also voted
j that each student be required to
! sign at the end of his paper a
pledge stating that he had neither
! given nor received assistance in the
examination. It was also agreed
that instructors were to avoid even
the appearance of watching stu
dents. The examiner was to be
present solely for the purposes of
presiding and answering the neces
sary questions, but was to be free
to leave the room at any time. The
only restraints to be put upon the
freedom of the students were such
as were necessary to preserve the
decorum of the examination. They
i also were free to leave the room
| and to communicate with one an
i other.
The result was very interesting.
! Cheating vanished from the exami
| nations of the senior and junior
classes as if by magic, and from
i then till now but a single case of it
in these classes has been known.
Three or four sophomores had the
temerity to brave the frowns and
warnings of their neighbors, and
cheated openly and somewhat defi
antly, while a number of freshmen
cheated shamelessly. The indig
nation of the college was aroused
| at once. There was an imrnedi ite
j call for a mass-meeting, and one
| day, before the examinations were
half over, there gathered in the
| Old Chapel the most thoroughly
I stirred and determined body of
i undergraduates that ever met on
the Princeton campus. No athletic
meeting ever equalled it. The
meeting decreed that any student
mean enough to cheat when put
j upon his honor was no fit man for
Princeton, and must go. it ap-
I pointed a characteristic student
i committee, of which the leader of
the Glee Club was chairman, and
football and baseball men and
I other students of strong personality
and pluck were the members, with
instructions to summon witnesses
and gather what evidence it could
respecting the students charged by
campus rumor with cheating, to
confront these students with the
evidence against them, and to deal
adequately with every man of
whose guilt there was no question.
The committee discharged its
difficult and delicate duty with
| magnificent fidelitj' and great dis
cretion. After careful deliberation
it very wisely decided that time
enough had not elapsed for the col
lege freely to realize the honor
j principle in examinations, and
j that it would be fairest—especially
' as the culprits were all under-class

men —to give any man who chose
to take it the chance to save him
self by confessing his guilt to the
examiners under whom he cheated,
and taking another examination.
It was its unanimous decision that
thereafter but one penalty could be
considered—a recommendation to
the faculty of dismission from col
lege.
The committee was able to get
evidence enough to convict two
sophomores and two of the guilty
freshmen, and all of these but one,
a sophomore, availed themse Ives
of the privilege of confessing to
their examiners. Against certain
other freshmen, of whose guilt it was
convinced, the committee could not
get sufficient evidence, because their
friends leagued together to shield
them. One man plucky enough to
testify was for a time ostracized by
his former club-mates. It is an
interesting fact that most of these
men soon disappeared from college.
The remaining sophomore—a
man who had cheated in almost
every examination he had taken,
and against whom the evidence
was conclusive—was defiant. He
denied the jurisdiction of the com
mittee, refused to submit to trial,
and set himself at work among his
friends to stir up revolt against
the new order of things. The little
mutiny was of short duration. A
committee of fifty juniors waited on
the would-be mutineers one night
and nothing further was heard
from them. The feeling against
the guilty sophomore meanwhile
was becoming intense, and threats
were frequent that if he did not
soon disappear of his own motion,
his traps would be thrown into a
mule-cart and he be drummed out
of town after it to the tune of the
"Rogue's March." He appealed to
the facult}', asserting his innocence
most brazenly. The student com
mittee at once presented its evi
dence, withholding only the names
of the witnesses. The faculty con
sidered it and the defense of the
accused man very carefully, was
satisfied of his guilt, and promptly
required him to leave college.
Since those memorable examina
tions in January and February,
1893, cheating has been compara
tively unknown at Princeton.
At the June examinations of
that same year a freshman copied
from the papers of a classmate
without his connivance or knowl
edge. The examiner noticed the
correspondence between the papers
of the two men, and had no diffi
culty in determining which of them
was guilty, and in seeing that the
other was guiltless of giving assist
ance. By the advice of the faculty
he laid his evidence before the stu
dent committee. The guilty man
was summoned, admitted his guilt,
and was told that if he returned in
the fall the faculty would be asked
to dismiss him from college. He
did not return. Twice only since
then have indications of cheating
been noticed in papers handed in
by students. In each instance the
evidence was put into the hands of
the student committee, who found
one of the men accused innocent,
the other guilty. The guilty man
was dismissed from college.
In the mid-year examination of
1894 two students were proved
guilty of cheating—a senior and a
freshman. The committee recom
mended that the senior be dis
missed from college,and the faculty
acted in accordance with the com
mittee's recommendation; but the
freshman was allowed to confess
his guilt to the examiner and take a
new examination,on theground that
he had not been long enough in
Princeton to realize what Princeton
honor meant. This senior was the
only upper-classman against whom
there has ever been even a suspicion
of cheating since the honor system
went into operation. He had the
temerity to return for class-day,
and was ostracised by his class
mates for his pains.
No case of cheating was reported
at the examination in June last,
but four cases, all under-classmen,
came before the committee after
the recent February examinations.
One of the four was acquitted, the
remaining three convicted. It was
recommended to the faculty, with a
presentation of the evidences, as in
previous cases, that the one who
was a freshman should, in consid
eration of that fact, be merely sus
pended, but that the others be dis
missed, unless they chose to with
draw of their own accord within
one week. They withdrew at once.
The last two cases illustrate
strikingly the high standard set by
the student committee. Neither
man had handed in the portion of
his work which was dishonest.
Each had been detected using a
crib by one of his neighbors, and
had seen that he was detected.
The one had thereupon handed in
a blank paper, and the other a
paper from which the dishonest
work had carefully been eraced,
and from which the pledge was
absent. Hut when examined by
the committee, both were forced to
admit that detection alone had
prevented the dishonest work going
in to the examiner, and the judg
ment of the committee, since then
unanimously endorsed by a mass
meeting of the collegp, was that,
except in the case of a freshman,
under the honor system cheating
in examinations, in whatever
degree, whether it consisted in
giving or in receiving assistance,
was a capital offence, for which
there was no adequate penalty
short of final separation from the
college. A culprit whose offense
was not particularly heinous was
to have the privilege of withdraw
ing without formal vote of dismis
sal by the faculty, but leniency
was to go no further.

The original student body
committee disbanded after act
ing on cases of cheating which
it had been appointed to
investigate. Since then there;
has heen no permanent com
mittee, but the presidents of the
four undergraduate classes" have
served as a committee when occa
sion for investigation and action
has arisen. Their work has uni
formly been characterized by the
utmost care, discretion and fair
ness. The mode of procedure is
the simplest possible: The wit
nesses against the accused student
are first heard. The accused is
then summoned, and after the evi
dence against him lias been read,
allowed to make his statement and
to present witnesses for his defence.

his guilt to the examiner and take a
new examination,on theground that
he had not been long enough in
Princeton to realize what Princeton
honor meant. This senior was the
only upper-classman against whom
there has ever been even a suspicion
of cheating since the honor system
went into operation. He had the
temerity to return for class-day,
and was ostracised by his class
mates for his pains.
No case of cheating was reported
at the examination in June last,
but four cases, all under-classmen,
came before the committee after
the recent February examinations.
One of the four was acquitted, the
remaining three convicted. It was
recommended to the faculty, with a
presentation of the evidences, as in
previous cases, that the one who
was a freshman should, in consid
eration of that fact, be merely sus
pended, but that the others be dis
missed, unless they chose to with
draw of their own accord within
one week. They withdrew at once.
The last two cases illustrate
strikingly the high standard set by
the student committee. Neither
man had handed in the portion of
his work which was dishonest.
Each had been detected using a
crib by one of his neighbors, and
had seen that he was detected.
The one had thereupon handed in
a blank paper, and the other a
paper from which the dishonest
work had carefully been eraced,
and from which the pledge was
absent. Hut when examined by
the committee, both were forced to
admit that detection alone had
prevented the dishonest work going
in to the examiner, and the judg
ment of the committee, since then
unanimously endorsed by a mass
meeting of the collegp, was that,
except in the case of a freshman,
under the honor system cheating
in examinations, in whatever
degree, whether it consisted in
giving or in receiving assistance,
was a capital offence, for which
there was no adequate penalty
short of final separation from the
college. A culprit whose offense
was not particularly heinous was
to have the privilege of withdraw
ing without formal vote of dismis
sal by the faculty, but leniency
was to go no further.

The original student body
committee disbanded after act
ing on cases of cheating which
it had been appointed to
investigate. Since then there;
has heen no permanent com
mittee, but the presidents of the
four undergraduate classes" have
served as a committee when occa
sion for investigation and action
has arisen. Their work has uni
formly been characterized by the
utmost care, discretion and fair
ness. The mode of procedure is
the simplest possible: The wit
nesses against the accused student
are first heard. The accused is
then summoned, and after the evi
dence against him lias been read,
allowed to make his statement and
to present witnesses for his defence.
The case is then decided in accord
ance with the evidence.
There was a strong feeling at the
outset against trammeling the
movement with unnecessary ma
chinery, and a conviction that time
and experience would evolve the
best mode of administering it. But j
the system has grown into such i
definite form that it is possible to
embody it in a written constitution.
The need of such a constitution has
come to be felt, and accordingly
one was adopted at a mass-meeting
of the college held May Ist of the
present year. The purpose of the
constitution, as stated iifthe pream
ble, is "in order to preserve the
high standard of honor recognized
by the establishment of the Honor
System in examination, to regulate
the procedure and organization of
an undergraduate committee of in
vestigation and punishment, and
to insure its continuous and uni
form action." The constitution is
a very complete document, provid
ing for a regular committee, a fixed
mode of procedure, and permanent
records. The penalty provided for
all violations of the "Honor Sys
tem," except those of freshmen, is a
recommendation to the faculty of
final separation from college, "with
the addition, in extreme cases, of
publication to a mass-meeting of
the college." For freshmen the
penalty is to be "a recommendation
of suspension for a time determined
by the committee."
The movement haR been char
acterized throughout by much dig
nit}' and a freedom from sensa
tional features, and on that ac
count it has attracted little notice
since its inauguration in 1893.
The first news of its success, how
ever, aroused a great deal of inter
est among the students of other
colleges, and the various under
graduate journals at once took up
the question. The students of
Wesleyan University introduced
the Princeton plan. The Amherst
Student urged that the new "Prince
ton system" be tried at Amherst.
The Cornell Era asserted that "a
similar change in the method of
conducting examinations should be
welcomed by Cornell students."
The Harvard Advocate character
ized the Princeton movement as
"better than twenty victories at
football," and the Yale Cow-ant
said, "Princeton is to be congratu
lated on the step she has taken,
I and we wish that Yale might be
theffirst to follow her." Such is
the history of the Princeton
students for honor in examina
tions —a movement which has only
gained strength with time, and
which has established the "Honor
System" as one of the permanent
institutions of Princeton.

; The present method of conduct
-1 ing examinations at Princeton was
| inaugurated in January, 1893. Just
! before the mid-vear examinations,
in response to the strong desire of
the college, the faculty decided to
abandon the old plan of watching
; students, and resolved to put them
j on their honor. In accordance
[ with their wish, it was also voted
j that each student be required to
! sign at the end of his paper a
pledge stating that he had neither
! given nor received assistance in the
examination. It was also agreed
that instructors were to avoid even
the appearance of watching stu
dents. The examiner was to be
present solely for the purposes of
presiding and answering the neces
sary questions, but was to be free
to leave the room at any time. The
only restraints to be put upon the
freedom of the students were such
as were necessary to preserve the
decorum of the examination. They
i also were free to leave the room
| and to communicate with one an
i other.
The result was very interesting.
! Cheating vanished from the exami
| nations of the senior and junior
classes as if by magic, and from
i then till now but a single case of it
in these classes has been known.
Three or four sophomores had the
temerity to brave the frowns and
warnings of their neighbors, and
cheated openly and somewhat defi
antly, while a number of freshmen
cheated shamelessly. The indig
nation of the college was aroused
| at once. There was an imrnedi ite
j call for a mass-meeting, and one
| day, before the examinations were
half over, there gathered in the
| Old Chapel the most thoroughly
I stirred and determined body of
i undergraduates that ever met on
the Princeton campus. No athletic
meeting ever equalled it. The
meeting decreed that any student
mean enough to cheat when put
j upon his honor was no fit man for
Princeton, and must go. it ap-
I pointed a characteristic student
i committee, of which the leader of
the Glee Club was chairman, and
football and baseball men and
I other students of strong personality
and pluck were the members, with
instructions to summon witnesses
and gather what evidence it could
respecting the students charged by
campus rumor with cheating, to
confront these students with the
evidence against them, and to deal
adequately with every man of
whose guilt there was no question.
The committee discharged its
difficult and delicate duty with
| magnificent fidelitj' and great dis
cretion. After careful deliberation
it very wisely decided that time
enough had not elapsed for the col
lege freely to realize the honor
j principle in examinations, and
j that it would be fairest—especially
' as the culprits were all under-class

men —to give any man who chose
to take it the chance to save him
self by confessing his guilt to the
examiners under whom he cheated,
and taking another examination.
It was its unanimous decision that
thereafter but one penalty could be
considered—a recommendation to
the faculty of dismission from col
lege.
The committee was able to get
evidence enough to convict two
sophomores and two of the guilty
freshmen, and all of these but one,
a sophomore, availed themse Ives
of the privilege of confessing to
their examiners. Against certain
other freshmen, of whose guilt it was
convinced, the committee could not
get sufficient evidence, because their
friends leagued together to shield
them. One man plucky enough to
testify was for a time ostracized by
his former club-mates. It is an
interesting fact that most of these
men soon disappeared from college.
The remaining sophomore—a
man who had cheated in almost
every examination he had taken,
and against whom the evidence
was conclusive—was defiant. He
denied the jurisdiction of the com
mittee, refused to submit to trial,
and set himself at work among his
friends to stir up revolt against
the new order of things. The little
mutiny was of short duration. A
committee of fifty juniors waited on
the would-be mutineers one night
and nothing further was heard
from them. The feeling against
the guilty sophomore meanwhile
was becoming intense, and threats
were frequent that if he did not
soon disappear of his own motion,
his traps would be thrown into a
mule-cart and he be drummed out
of town after it to the tune of the
"Rogue's March." He appealed to
the facult}', asserting his innocence
most brazenly. The student com
mittee at once presented its evi
dence, withholding only the names
of the witnesses. The faculty con
sidered it and the defense of the
accused man very carefully, was
satisfied of his guilt, and promptly
required him to leave college.
Since those memorable examina
tions in January and February,
1893, cheating has been compara
tively unknown at Princeton.
At the June examinations of
that same year a freshman copied
from the papers of a classmate
without his connivance or knowl
edge. The examiner noticed the
correspondence between the papers
of the two men, and had no diffi
culty in determining which of them
was guilty, and in seeing that the
other was guiltless of giving assist
ance. By the advice of the faculty
he laid his evidence before the stu
dent committee. The guilty man
was summoned, admitted his guilt,
and was told that if he returned in
the fall the faculty would be asked
to dismiss him from college. He
did not return. Twice only since
then have indications of cheating
been noticed in papers handed in
by students. In each instance the
evidence was put into the hands of
the student committee, who found
one of the men accused innocent,
the other guilty. The guilty man
was dismissed from college.
In the mid-year examination of
1894 two students were proved
guilty of cheating—a senior and a
freshman. The committee recom
mended that the senior be dis
missed from college,and the faculty
acted in accordance with the com
mittee's recommendation; but the
freshman was allowed to confess
his guilt to the examiner and take a
new examination,on theground that
he had not been long enough in
Princeton to realize what Princeton
honor meant. This senior was the
only upper-classman against whom
there has ever been even a suspicion
of cheating since the honor system
went into operation. He had the
temerity to return for class-day,
and was ostracised by his class
mates for his pains.
