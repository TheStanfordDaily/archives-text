# VARSITY RESUMES PRACTICE.
## But Nine Players Turned Out for Light Formation Work Yesterday. 
### 
Football practice was begun
again yesterday afternoon in prepa
ration for the Thanksgiving game
with the Perris Indians. But nine
of the Varsity players responded to
the call of Captain Bansbach, and
none of the five substitutes who
were supposed to accompany the
team South were on the field.
Coach Lanagan ran the men
through formations for twenty
minutes. No other work was done
as the field was too wet for punting
and falling on the ball. The line
up was —center, Hauverman; left
guard, Thompson; right guard,
Jacobs; right tackle, Shields; left
end, Clark; right end, Smith; quar
ter, Bansbach; right half, Chal
mers; full-back, Scholfield.
Two Varsity players, Weller and
Sprott, will not go with the
team as they have not fully re
covered from bruises received in
the intercollegiate game. Of the
five substitutes first announced, C.
E. Hyde is the only one who will
go with the team. To take the
place of the others, Monzingo will
go as left tackle, Butterfield sub
end, and J. E. Dole sub-half-back.
This reduces the number of players
who will go on the trip to thirteen.
Practice will continue tomorrow
and Monday. While the team will
lack much of the stength that it
had' in the intercollegiate game, it
should be sufficiently strong to pile
uj) a good score on the Perris
Indians.
