Because the sentiment and spirit
among the students is at present so
strong and wholesome, we believe
that the time is auspicious for the
adoption of the honor system in
examinations. This view is not
taken owing to any flagrant abuses
of honor in the examinations this
year, or because there is any de
moralized state of affairs demand
ing immediate attention. Enough
cheating, however, is constantly
going on in classrooms to warrant
many in thinking that the honor
system would work a genuine
reform and clear the atmosphere
of all taint of dishonesty. Beyond
this, there are many other reasons
whv a change in the custom of
handling violations would be wel
comed with enthusiasm by every
one who has the interests and
the reputation of the University at
heart. The Daily PaloAltobelieves
that there is a widespread feeling
among the undergraduates in favor
of the new system, and it proposes
to begin an agitation which it hopes
will result in arousing the students
to take realization of what the hon
or code would mean to Stanford.
With this end in view we have
written to President Woodrow Wil
son, Dean H. B. Fine, and a prom
inent undergraduate of Princeton
for views as to the workings of the
system at that university, where
the feeling of honor in examinations
has built up among the students a
tradition that is known far and
wide. These letters will be pub
lished next week, together with
views on both sides from Stanford
men and women. In order that
the method of application might be
thoroughly understood, publication
of an article on the Princeton sys
tem originally printed in Harpers'
Weekly is given in today's issue.
While an exact duplicate of the
committee system is not in mind
here, the general ideas are the
same. It must be understood from
the first that the purpose of the

honor code at Stanford come√ü en
tirely from the students. It ia an
undergraduate idea, pure and sim
ple, and should the students
adopt it, the first step towards
student control over their own af
fairs will have been taken.
