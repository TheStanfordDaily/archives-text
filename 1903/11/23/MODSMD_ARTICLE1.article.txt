# HANDICAP FIELD-MEET.
## Hard-fought Contests on Slow Track. Dole Shows Well in Pole-Vault. 
### 
The field-day held on the oval
Saturday, despite unfavorable
weather conditions, was an unqual
ified success. Trainer Moulton ex
pressed himself as highly pleased
with the showing made by the new
men, and especially gratified with
the pole-vaulting of N. E. Dole, '04,
who with.ease cleared the bar at 11
feet. Many of the old track men
did not participate in the meet, and
most of those who did take part
were so heavily handicapped as to
be practically without a chance of
winning, owing to the heavy track
and shortening of the events.
Turpin, '06, was given first place
in the 80-yard dash, but he was
hard pushed by P. A. Wood, '07,
from the Sacramento high school.
In the 150-yard dash Wood beat
Turpin by a scant foot.
The 120-yard low hurdles was an
exciting race, but the lack of prac
tice caused the participants to run
in bad form. Macfarland, '07,
West, '06, and Leonard, '07, fin
ished in the order named.
Fraser, '05, beat Powers, '06, in
the run in a very hard
fought finish. The other distance
race —the ¾-mile run —was won by
Presley, '07. Gay, '04, the scratch
man, gave him a hard fight, but
the distance was too short to over
come the heavy handicap.
The less exciting tield events pro
duced several records which are
good for this time of the year. All
the high jumpers went over the bar
at 5 feet, where they were compelled
to desist on account of the soft run
way. West, '06, cleared 19 feet 4
inches in the broad jump; Dole,
'04, pole-vaulted 11 feet; Crawford,
'05, threw the hammer 135 feet 9
inches; Hyde, '04, put the shot 39
