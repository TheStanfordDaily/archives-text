President Woodrow Wilson's
letter, which is printed in another
column, will bear very careful and
thoughtful reading by everybody,
and especially by those who may
have any misgivings as to the suc
cess of the honor system at Stanford.
Many reasons assert themselves
why the honor system would be
an unqualified good to Stanford.
In the first place, cheating will be
done away with. The argument
will arise that dishonesty in exam
inations will go on just as much.
Where the honor code has been
tried,it has been shown conclusively
that those who were clever enough
to outwit the instructors before, did
not dare run the risk of detection
by their fellow students with the
ultimate ostracism and expulsion.
Those who will brave the united
disapproval of the undergraduates
may be placed in the category of
the habitual criminal who steals
because it is his nature, and who
can see no harm in so doing. Such
students do no credit to the Univer
sity, to their fellow students, or to
themselves ; and their presence
among those who are solicitous of the
University's reputation should not
be countenanced. In the next
place the establishment of the
honor system among the students
would result in the greatest frank
ness of attitude on the part of stu
dent toward student and students
toward faculty. It will shorten
the breach between students and
faculty and result in a clearer un
derstanding between both. The
way for greater reforms in student
body actions will be paved, because
there will be revealed to every stu
dent the fact that he can trust
every other student. In short the
Daily Palo Alto believes in the
honor code in examinations be
cause the present system is not
satisfactory,-because absolute hon
esty in examinaiions is the only

rule of integrity to follow, and
those who will not respond to the
sentiment are not worthy of asso
ciation with honest students. The
sentiment of the student body is on
the side of this reform because it is
a manly system.
