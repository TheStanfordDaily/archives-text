# TEAM LEAVES TOMORROW.
## Nineteen Men Will Make the Trip to Los Angeles. 
### 
This afternoon the Varsity held
its last practice preparatory to its
departure for the South. Friday,
Saturday, and today the team went
through formations and signal
practice under the direction of
Coach Lanagan. W. H. Dole, who
will do the kicking in place of
Sprott, has been showing up well.
When the team arrives in Los An
geles it will do light work to put
the finishing touches on the forma
tions.
Nineteen men will be taken
south. These will be Coach Lana
gan, Treasurer Cowden, Major Col
lins, Captain Bansbach, and fifteen
players. One of the players has
not yet been chosen. The other
fourteen are: Left end, Stephenson;
left tackle, Monzingo; left guard,
Thompson; center, Hauverman;
right guard, Jacobs; right tackle,
Shields; right end, Smith; quarter,
Bansbach; left half, W. H. Dole;
right half, Chalmers; full-back,
Scholfield; substitutesâ€”end, H. P.
Butterfield; tackle, H. G. Butter
field; center and guard, Hyde;
half-back, G. E. Dole. Major Col
lins will act as one of the officials
in the game. Of the regular Var
sity players three will remain at
home Sprott, Clark, and Weiler.
Their absence will be plainly felt,
as they are three of the strongest
players on the team.
With a notoriously weakened
eleven it becomes a matter of doubt
whether or not the Cardinal can
out-play the Indians. The south
erners have a formidable eleven,
and their team is especially strong
at the tackle position, where Stan
ford is weak. The absence of both
Sprott and Clark from the left side
of the Varsity line will make that
place one untenable to strong offen
sive playing. Whatever the score
may prove to be, the game will be
hard-fought and the result doubt
ful.
The team will leave the campus
tomorrow evening, and will arrive
in Los Angeles Wednesday fore
noon. The game is called for
Thursday afternoon at 2:30.
