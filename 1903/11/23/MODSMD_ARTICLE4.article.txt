Before a large crowd on Satur
day afternoon the first two inter
fraternity football games were
played. Zeta Psi scored a touch
down against Chi Psi, but there is
a question about allowing the
points on account of inaccurate

Alpha Epsilon played a game with
no score. This game will probably
be played off a week from next
Saturdav.
