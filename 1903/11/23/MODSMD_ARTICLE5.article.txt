# ALL-PACIFIC ELEVEN.
## Stanford Given Five Places, California Five, and Reliance One. 
### 
Archie Rice, '95, of the Chronicle>
has picked out what he terms a
"winning All-Pacific eleven," in
which Stanford and the University
of California are given equal repre
sentation, the eleventh place is
given to Cavanaugh, the heavy
Reliance center. With a single ex
ception, no other player outside of
the two Varsity teams, is deemed
to at all approach their standard.
That exception is Pierce, the Perris
Indian guard, whose work perhaps
proved him the superior of Stow of
California. Rice's line-up of the
hypothetical team, and also of a
second team, is its follows:
FIRST ELEVEN SECOND ELEVEN
Clark, S end Smith, S
Hudson, C end . . .Smith, Nev
Sprott, S tackle ..Steckle, Nev
Heitmuller, C tackle .... Shields, S
Overall, C. ~ .guard .Thompson, S
Stow, C guard ...Pierce, P Ind
Cavanaugh, R center ... .Stroud, C
Bansbach, S quarter More, C
Dole, S half . . .Snedigar, C
Mini, C half McMillan, Mul
Weller, 5... full-back Atkinson, R
In making the selections Rice
has considered the ability of the
man at his particular position and
his all-round value to his team,
as shown by his work during the
entire season. On the line and at
the ends the team would be very
strong on defense, and the back
field would rank high in line
plunging, dashes past tackles, and
end-running. The weak point of
the team, the critic says, would be
its lack of a full-back who com
bined all the qualities that should
be found in the ideal player of that
position. There is no man in the
Coast teams who has the combined
ability to kick, run in punts, tackle
in the back-field, and advance the
ball well.
Rice selects Clark of Stanford as
the best end, and Sprott of Stan
ford as the bestitackle. Bansbach
he regards as the best quarter, with
Lead better of Nevada for the second
team. Hudson, the California
end, is selected as the best man for
captain on his showing in the last
intercollegiate game.
