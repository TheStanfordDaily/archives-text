# Washington Defeats Nevada.
## 
### 
Last Friday the University of
Washington football team defeated
the eleven from the University of
Nevada by the score of 2-0. Be
cause of this victory Washington
claims the Coast championship,
since Nevada defeated California
and tied Stanford. This claim
is admitted neither by California
nor Stanford, both of whom regard
their games with Nevada as merely
preliminary to the intercollegiate
contest between the two California
universities. There is a possibility
that California and Washington
may arrange a game for the Christ
mas holidays, in which event a
close line on the respective merits
of the different Coast teams could
be drawn.
