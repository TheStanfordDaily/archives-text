# PRESIDENT ON HONOR SYSTEM.
## Woodrow Wilson of Princeton Writes His Opinions on Student Control of Cheating. 
### 
Upon the request of the Daily
Palo Alto President Woodrow
Wilson of Princeton University
gives the following testimonial-of
the workings of the honor system
at that university. The letter
shows what success the honor
method has had in examinations at
Princeton, and also indicates the
attitude of the faculty upon stu
dent control of cheating. Presi
dent Wilson's opinions naturally
will have great weight, not only on
account of his rank as a historian
and man of letters, but because he
is best qualified to speak of the
workings of the system at Prince
ton. Woodrow Wilson is a gradu
ate of that university in the class
of '79. He was connected with the
faculty of the University of Vir
ginia for some time prior to his
return to his alma mater. Upon
the retirement of President Patton
he was unanimously chosen to fill
the executive chair of that univer
sity. His letter follows:
Princeton, N. J., Nov. 10, 1903.
"I can speak in the most unqual
ified way of the success of the honor
system here. It was inaugurated
upon the initiative of the students
themselves, and, with some doubt
on the part of a few members of
the faculty, accepted by that body.
All doubts that may have existed
about it have been removed by its
success. It has operated in the
most wholesome way, and I think
that it is no exaggeration to say
that it has affected the whole life of
the university, especially with
regard to candor of attitude on the
part of students toward the faculty.
"In the first number of Jfarpcr's
Weekly for June, 1895, you will find
a careful account of the first year
or two of our experience under the
system, and 1 feel sure that that
account will enable you to under
stand how absolute the success of
it has been. In recent years there
have been so few cases of discipline
under the system that we now look
upon any breach of its understand
ings as a most exceptional and
extraordinary thing. Nothing that
has been done in recent years at
Princeton has given us more uni
versal satisfaction.
"Woodrow Wilson."
