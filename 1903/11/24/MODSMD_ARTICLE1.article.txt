# VARSITY SWEATERS AWARDED.
## Athletic Committee Postpones Presentation of Emblems to Substitutes and Second Team. 
### 
At a regular meeting of the
Athletic Committee last night, the
following new men received Var
sity football sweaters: Weller,
Scholfield, Chalmers, Shields, Jac
obs, and Smith. Of the old men,
Captain Bansbach, Dole, Sprott,
Thompson, Hauverman, and Clark
were given the varsity emblems.
At the next meeting Captain Bans
bach will make his report as to
whom substitute and second team
sweaters shall be awarded. The
usual black German "S" will be
awarded to the men who were on
the side-lines at the intercollegiate
game, and the white German "S"
to members of the second team.
The committee on records, com
posed of N. E. Dole, W. R. Ham
ilton, and R. B. Ball, made a par
tial report. There is some question
as to whether Dunn's record in the
440, made at a private field-meet,
and which has been accepted as
the Coast record, shall be accepted
as a Stanford record. The mem
bers of the committee are commun
icating with Eastern colleges to find
what the custom is there, and
whether records made in other than
intercollegiate events shall stand.
The following other records are in
question: Thelovv hurdle in 26 1-5
seconds by H. B. Reynolds,' 96; the
220-yard dash in 22 flat by J. C.
McCaughern, '03; and the 100-yard
dash in 9 4-5 seconds by John
Brunton, ex-'99. The committee
will report to the Athletic Commit
tee, which in turn will decide on the
records.
The athletic agreement with Cal
ifornia will come up for renewal in
January, and the committee dis
cussed various phases of the agree
ment. The question as to the
advisability of holding the inter
collegiate football games on the
university grounds was discussed
and the committee seemed in favor
of making the change.
