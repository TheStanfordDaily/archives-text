# DEBATE STATEHOOD QUESTION.
## Subject for Freshman â€“ Sophomore Contest Next Semester Chosen Yesterday. 
### 
The Sophomore debating squad
have chosen as the question for the
Freshman-Sophomore debate, "Re
solved, That the conditions in New
Mexico and Arizona justify the
present congress in admitting them
to statehood." The Freshman
team will have until tomorrow
night in which to choose sides.
A movement is on foot to stimu
late interest in the under-class de
bates by offering a cup which shall
be handed down from year to year.
On the trophy will be engraved the
subjects and winners of each con
test. No definite steps to carry
this through have been taken yet.
