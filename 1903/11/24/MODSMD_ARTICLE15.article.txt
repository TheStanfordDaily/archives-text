## Professor H.B. Fine Tells What Faculty Thinks of Honor System. 
### 
The following interesting letter
from Professor 11. B. Fine, dean of
the faculty of Princeton University,
will give a clear idea of the
way the faculty members regard
the honor system at that institu
tion. In connection with the testi
monial of President Woodrow Wil
son, published in yesterday's pa
per, Dean Fine's letter shows how
absolute the success of the honor
code has been. Dean Fine is one of
the most prominent of the Prince
ton faculty, and is the faculty ath
letic representative. At present he
is a member of the Eastern inter
collegiate football rules committee.
"Princeton, N. J., Nov. 11, 1903.
"At the suggestion of Dr. Wilson
and because of my deep personal
interest in the honor system, I take
this liberty of adding a line to the
letter he has already written in re
ply to your inquiries of the sth
inst.
At the inception of the honor
system at Princeton a considerable
number of our professors had very
serious misgivings as to its success,
and some of them went 60 far as to
oppose it; but I am satisfied that
at present it would be impossible
to find a member of the Princeton
faculty who would not give the sys
tem his emphatic endorsement.
We believe that it has caused
cheating in our examinations to
disappear almost entirely. We
find no evidence of cheating in the
papers which the students hand in
—that is one piece of evidence.
The other is the testimony of all
the undergraduates with whom we
talk, for all of them agree in say
ing that they are convinced there
is no cheating.
In the course of the long series
of years that the honor system has
been in operation here there have
been a few isolated cases of cheat
ing—most of which occurred long
ago, soon after the inauguration of
the system. The student commit
tee on the honor system deaTt with
the utmost conscientiousness, and
the faculty accepted their findings
without modification of any kind.
In one or two instances the evi
dence against the guilty student
was discovered by the examiner in
the student's paper. The exami
ner in each instance turned this
evidence over to the student com
mittee —not to the faculty. I men
tion this fact, because in my opin
ion it is indispensable to the suc
cess of the honor system that the
administration of the system be
left entirety in the hands of the
students. In particular the exam
iners must do no watching.
Some of us believe, and I am one
of the number, that the honor sys
tem has done more than to rid our
examinations of cheating. It has
tended to make our students more
honorable in all their dealings
with the faculty. It very rarely
happens now, when a student ap
pears before the discipline commit
tee of the faculty, that he does not
make a frank and full confession
of his wrong-doing.
"Sincerely yours, H. B. Fine."
