A testimonial of the honor sys
tem from a man who holds such a
high position in university circles,
and is so greatly esteemed for his
strong stand on purity of athletics
and general honesty of attitude on
the part of college students in gen
eral, as Dean Fine of Princeton,
commends itself to Stanford stu
dents. A radical misconception
of the workings of the honor system
seems to he current, on the part
of a few students here and for this
reason a general statement of the
hopes of the system at Stanford
will be printed in tomorrow's issue.
No intention of accepting bodily
a duplicate of a system at any
other university concerns us at
present, nor does anyone think that
the Stanford students are willing
to forego a chance of improvement
over methods in vogue elsewhere.
With very few exceptions every
body admits that the honor system
would be an admirable thing for
Stanford â€”that it would universally
benefit students, student activities,
and the University above all. The
system, then, as a system, is what
we are striving for, and methods of
application are a secondary feature.
The honor code does not narrow
itself down to the mere ques
iion of one student telling
on another. Objection to re
porting a fellow student appears to
be the chief argument against the
new system. Those who withhold
sanction of the system because of a
dislike of telling presuppose the
presence of the same amount of
dishonesty and cheating under stu
dent control as exists under the
present unsatisfactory faculty su
pervision. The great value of the
honor system lies in the very fact
that cheating will be done away
with, and accordingly no occasion
for telling will be present. There
is no blind hopefulness among us
that the honor system is going to

bring about a complete absence of
dishonesty, but it will result in re
ducing cheating in examinations
to the strictest minimum. Under
the honor system it is not implied
that every student is going to
classes with the deliberate intention
of spying for cheating. What it
does mean, though, is that members
of the University will go to classes
with implicitconfidence in the hon
esty of their fellow students. No
occasion for reporting will exist af
ter the honor code has been firmly
established, for any breach of the
system would be regarded by the
students as a flagrant violation of
a sacred tradition. Instead of be
ing looked upon as an annoyance,
reporting of cheating will be re
garded wholly in the light of
a duty, and the occasion for
exercising this duty will be very
few when every student feels that
he is a part of a sacred tradition
that the entire undergraduate body
has been instrumental in establish
ing. Cases of cheating will become
so rare and extraordinary when
the code is once firmly established
that the student committee will
seldom be called upon to show its
jurisdiction. Breaches may be
expected occasionally until the
system becomes a tradition, but it
may be taken for granted that the
offenders will be a class who will
cheat anyway, and their absence
will rid the honor system of the
one obstacle to its complete success.
