Editor Daily Palo Alto:
At this time when the question
of the adoption of the honor
system in examinations is be
ing discussed, a statement based
on experience with its actual oper
ation in an Eastern university
might be of interest. Shortly after
the system was successfully estab
lished at Princeton it was intro
duced at Wesleyan University.
When I entered there the period of
discussion had passed and it had
become a tradition—a sentiment.
The entering student soon learned
that examinations were conducted
under a system far different from
any he had previously known.
During the examinations he was
given the greatest possible freedom
—nothing was forbidden so long as
his paper bore the simple pledge,
"I have neither given nor used aid
in this examination." And he
likewise understood that this tradi
tion rested on the condition that
the men must respect it enough to
protect it. As a result the fresh
man simply adjusted himself to
this college sentiment. He learned
to value his own signature beneath
the simple statement. Confidence
in his own honor led him to have
faith in the honor of the men about
him. And thedelicite problem of
reporting a classmate was avoided
—there was so little underhand
work that no one could detect it.
No one will be rash enough to
argue that cheating in examina
tions can be eliminated under any
system. During my four years at
college I only knew of two instan
ces — both freshmen—and I never
saw the slightest evidence of it.
But I do believe that under the
honor system many men will not
yield (o temptation who might
otherwise do so. In some colleges
where the system is not in use col
lege ethics not only condone but
find considerable satisfaction in
hoodwinking the proctor who is
paid to detect cheating. At no
college where the system is in effect
will you ever hear a man admit
that he has used or given aid—and
that is something gained. Under
the old system there is nothing to
prevent a man from being called
upon for aid, and college etlrics —
so-called —may demand that he
give it. The honor system puts an
immediate stop to such practices
and frees the honest student from
the demands of friendship or inter
est. The system breeds confidence
in man for man —and in that re
spect it reaches beyond the exami
nation room. And it also is a log
ical step towards another important
goal—a more perfect student con
trol of student affairs.
Many find the stumbling-block
in the system to be the necessity of
reporting offenders. That is essen
tial to the honor system. If the
system means anything, it deserves
to be faithfully protected. But at

Wesleyan we found" that that re-J
quirement was not an irksome one. ;
I knew of no case of reporting, be- j
cause I never could find a man
who had ever seen dishonesty in :
the classroom, and the men who
gladly admitted this were men who j
would willingly do their duty if j
called upon. And so the system ;
will work out at Stanford. It does
not seem to be demanded here
because of any prevalence of dis
honesty, but it has a larger mean- j
ing than merely to prevent cheat- -
ing. 1 hope it will be adopted.
