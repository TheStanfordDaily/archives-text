# Nevada Again Defeated.
## 
### 
The University of Nevada foot
ball team suffered another defeat
Monday, when the University of
Puget Sound scored a victory of 12
to 0. Telegraphic accounts from
Tacoma indicate that Puget Sound
University completely outplayed
the Nevadans, who were saved
from two more touchdowns only by
heroic stands close to their goal
line. Nevada's work when she had
the ball was spectacular, but very
erratic. On the defense the Puget
Sound men were superior, and
when they had the ball they found
no difficulty in getting through
Nevada's line and around the ends.
Only once was their goal-line
threatened. Steckle of Nevada
suffered a broken collar-bone.
The score by which the Univer
sity of Washington defeated Neva
da was 2 to 0, so it is probable that
Puget Sound University will in its
turn lay claim to the football
championship of the Pacific Coast.
