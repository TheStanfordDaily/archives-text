Chaplain Gardner preached both
in the morning and in the afternoon
in Memorial Church last Sunday.
His sermon at the morning service
had for its subject the revival of
interest in religion,a revival which
he thought represented not only a
reaction against false ideas, but
also another epoch in the spiritual
consciousness of the race. Rev.
Gardner included in his sermon an
examination of the principles of the
life of Christ which made him more
than a moral leader, principles
which make his gospel more than
a moral codeâ€”instead, a revelation
of God, and man's relation to him.
At the afternoon service Rev.
Gardner gave an address on
"Temptation."
