# Letter to Coach Lanagan.

### 
Since the following letter from
Dr. Frank Angell, chairman of the
faculty committee on athletics, to
James F. Lanagan, head coach »>f
the football team, is partially ofli
cial, it is published:
My Dear Lanauan: —I desire to
congratulate you for the work you
have accomplished in football this

season. Remembering the reluc
tance with which you consented to
assume the duties of head coach,
—that it took the combined and
repeated efforts of Dr. Jordan,
Captain Bansbach, and myself to
get you down here even for the few
afternoon hours which you were
able to spare from your teaching
duties —I feel that you deserve not
only our congratulations, but our
hearty thanks.
I must tell you frankly that in
urging you so insistently to accept
the position of head coach the first
consideration in our minds was
that of discipline. We were confi
dent that you were the man to in
troduce and maintain in the foot
ball squad that system of discipline
which you actually carried into
execution. Your knowledge of the
details of the game and your effi
ciency in imparting your knowledge
were a surprise to rro one who has
watched your work with the Bel
mont team during the preceding
two years; but at the beginning, at
any rate, these matters weighed
less with us than the question of
discipline.
In addition to your efficiency in
discipline and instruction, you
have been able to inspire the team
with enthusiasm, and this I must
confess was a feature of your
coaching which I did not venture
to anticipate. In short, taking
your work as a whole, I think it
may be fairly said that you have
done the best coaching at Stanford
that we have seen since the last
season of Walter Camp.
Thanking and congratulating
you once more, I am
Very sincerely yours,
Frank Angeli..
