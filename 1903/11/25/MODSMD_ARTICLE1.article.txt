# INN CLUB ASSESSMENT.
## Each Member Will be Required to Pay Approximately Thirteen Dollars. 
### 
The amount of the assessment of
the Inn Club members has been
fixed at $12.95, and notices calling
for the payment of that sum will
be sent out to every member of the
club tomorrow. This rate has been
fixed after many conferences and a
thorough understanding with the
creditors. Upon its payment each
member will be given a receipt
which will be a complete discharge
of further responsibility.
According to the final figures that
were fixed upon, the total indebted
ness of the club was $2,694.27.
Since it was impossible to dispose
of the property of the club at a
reasonable price at the present
time, the creditors decided to take
this over at the approximate value
of $300. This reduced the total
indebtedness to $2,394.27. This
sum will be divided among the 185
members of the club, making an
individual assessment of $12.95.
This sum is expected to be paid by
December Bth.
At the present time about one
hundred and five members of the
club are now in college, and all
these will be requested to meet the
assessment. Notices will be sent to
every member who has left college,
calling his attention to his liability
and his moral responsibility to
meet it. A number of these men,
it is stated, have alread}' expressed
their willingness to pay when
called upon to do so.
