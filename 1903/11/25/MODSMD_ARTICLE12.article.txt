# MATTER OF SUMMER SCHOOL.
## Financial Reasons Mainly Prevent Inauguration of Extra Session Next Year. 
### 
The reason for the decision not
to establish a summer school at
Stanford next year is mainly the
uncertainty of its financial success.
The committee, headed by Dr. Far
rand, visited the University of Cal
ifornia to look into the conditions
there, and was able to estimate
closely the probable expense inci
dent to the establishment of a simi
lar school here, and the authorities
decided that the cost was too great
at the present time when so heavy
a drain upon the University's
finances is being made tojcarry on
the construction and furnishing of
the new buildings. This unusual
expense will practically come to an
end upon the completion of the
buildings now under process of con
struction. By the end of next year
the question of a summer school
will be taken up again.
