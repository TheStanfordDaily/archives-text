Whatever objection arises over
the honor system seems to be based
on a misunderstanding of just what
will be done in case the sentiment
of the University is for a change.
Many have a vague idea of what
the method undertakes, but few
who make strong arguments
against substituting student control
for the faculty supervision clearly
see what the advantages are. The
contention is made that the present
way of disciplining is good enough.
"Why a change ?" is asked. This
optimistic attitude is taken quite
generally by students in depart
ments where no cheating exists.
However, such departments are
very few. The Law department is
a conspicuous example, and to the
credit of the honor system it will
have to be admitted that no cheat
ing or dishonesty goes on in the
Law department because the pro
fessors maintain the honor code by
placing confidence in their students.
One of the very best arguments for
the establishment of the honor sys
tem at Stanford lies in the very
fact that in those classes where the
professors conduct the examina
tions as they would be carried on
Under student control of cheating,
no dishonesty exists and it rarely
happens that the professors find
any evidence of cheating in the

papers turned in by the students.
Such a condition of affairs through
out the University will be brought
about if the honor system is ac
cepted by the students as a Univer
sity tradition. The honor code
will remove the premium on dis
honesty and bestow the advantages
on the side of honest students.
Those who depend on their intelli
gence, their memory, and ability to
assimilate, will not go into ex
aminations feeling that it is im
possible to get a good mark because
the standard has been raised so
high by the dishonest students who
are enabled to hand in perfect
answers because of cheating in the
way of "cribs" or other devices.
The student who spends his time
in honest application will not find
himself hopelessly handicapped by
the dishonest person who idles his
time away and at the last moment
passes a perfect examination by
questionable methods.
