Editor Daily Pai.o Alto:
The committee on Senior pins
has definitely decided to adopt the
design previously described in these
columns â€”the University seal with
the outer field of red enamel and
the inner Held of antique gold. A
very slight objection to this pin
was expressed, because of the en
amel, and the committee postponed
action until a new sample pin of
pure gold could be made. This
sample has been received and is
entirely unsatisfactory. It can be
seen at the Bookstore. Orders for
the pin adopted as the class em
blem will be taken at the Book
store. The price will be stated
definitely next week.
