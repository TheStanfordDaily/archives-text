At a meeting of the Stanford
Tennis Club held last night the
report of the tennis court subscrip
tion committee was submitted.
They embodied in their report that
the old subscription lists have
been either cancelled or revised and
that new lists had been distributed
among the members of the club.
The work of collection will begin
at once and the sum realized will
be turned over to the committee
December 2d, when a detailed re
port will be made to the Executive
Committee.
Captain Baker has extended
the time another week within which
all of the preliminary challenge
matches must be played. Several
matches are still to be played off,
and the plan for ranking the con
testants has not been definitely
decided upon.
G. 10. Dole, '03, and J. C. Acker
man, '06, were elected to member
ship in tlie club.
