# THE HONOR SYSTEM.
## Methods of Applying It in Examinations. â€” Student Control of Cheating. 
### 
In view of the misconceptions of
the honor system that seem to pre
vail among a certain number of the
students, the following explanatory
remarks are given. No general ob
jection against the honor system as
a system seem to arise, but the
methods of application apparently
trouble those who are not sure
whether Stanford needs such a
code.
In general it may be stated that
the present agitation was begun
here because of the presence of
enough cheating in examinations
to warrant a change. That this
belief was current revealed itself in
a thorough discussion with many
students throughout the Univer
sity. A spontaneous sentiment
seems to prevail that the students
themselves should assume entire
control of dishonesty in examina
tions. The present agitation is a
student uprising purely, and if the
honor system be adopted the stu
dents will have entire charge of
disciplining violations of honor in
examinations.
The honor system may be traced
to institutions in the South, where
honesty in examinations is as much
a code of honor as in matters of
other personal affairs. Students
in many Southern institutions have
been under such a rule for many
years. The first great instance of
the adoption of the honor system
in a Northern college was at Prince
ton, where the students took charge
of disciplining in 1893. There it
met with immediate success, and at
the present time is considered one
of the strongest traditions at that
university. Cases of flagrant
cheating at other Eastern colleges
called attention to the Princeton
method. Wesleyan soon after
chose it, and a tradition has become
firmly set there that no cheating
goes on among the students. The
movement has gained strength in
Eastern colleges, and at Princeton
the system is regarded as one of its
mo6t sacred traditions.
If Stanford should adopt the
honor system, the movement would,
of course, have come entirely from
the students. The change simply
implies that they are to take
charge of all cases of cheating and
punish the offenders as they choose.
In general the means of enforcing
discipline would call for a student
committee composed of upper-class
men. who would be chosen or elect
ed in whatever way the entire
student body should decide. It
would be a representative commit
tee, made up of students so promi
nent and well known that their
presence would put a stamp of jus
tice and dignity on its actions. The
members may serve for a year, or
as long as the students desire them.
How many will make up the mem
bership will be decided by the
undergraduates.
Much interest is centered in the
method of enforcing the system.
In order that success be assured it
is necessary that every student
report to the student committee the
name of anyone whom lie lias seen

cheating. The offender is then
called before the committee, told of
the charges against him, and given
a chance to clear himself. If he
can do so nothing more is said,
and he is excused. In case he be
found guilty, he is given the alter
native of leaving the University
voluntarily or having his name
reported to the faculty as one
who should be expelled from the
University. The trial is entirely
secret, and no one outside the com
mittee knows that the student has
been requested to leave the Univer
sity.
Another essential feature of the
system is that the instructors shall
turn over to the student committee
all evidence of cheating that they
may detect in examination papers
handed in. The committee acts on
the evidence in the same way as
in the case of evidence handed in
by students.
The examinations will be con
ducted without any watching of
the students by the professors. The
latter will be free to leave the room
at any time, but their presence
naturally will be desired in case
information as to the examination
questions should be needed.
