# STANFORD DEFEATS INDIANS.
## Cardinal Wins a Clean Game, 18-0, in Los Angeles Thanksgiving Day. 
### 
The Sherman Indians were de
feated by Stanford last Thursday
in Los Angeles by the score of 18-0.
Besides the good quality of football
that Stanford men displayed, their
work was remarkable for its ex
treme fairness and absence of all
unsportsmanlike actions. The vic
tory was due almost entirely to the
well developed team work that
enabled the visitors to advance the
ball at will against the loose defen
sive play of the Indians. Stanford
scored three touchdowns and Smith
kicked goal each time. Captain
Bansbach made the first touchdown
on the quarter-back play. Stillman
secured the ball on a fumble two
yards from the Indians' goal and
rolled over the line for the second
touchdown; and the third was
scored by straight line bucking
Bansbach had carried the ball fifty
yards down the field on two suc
cessive quarter-back plays.
The offensive play of the Indians
was superior to their defensive
work, although Sherman held Stan
ford one yard from their goal for
three downs in a fine rally early in
the first half. Bemis Pierce, the
Indian full-back, played a wonder
ful game. His offensive work was
fine, and in backing up the line he
was wonderfully effective against
the dashes of the Stanford backs.
The Cardinal backs played an un
usually good game, although the
effective team work of the eleven
was the main factor in its decisive
victory.
DETAIL OF PLAY.
Sherman won the toss, and Stan
ford kicked to the fifteen-yard line
and forced the Indians to kick.
Pierce kicked fifty-five yards to
Dole, who ran the ball in ten yards
before being downed. Stanford
made first down twice and then
was forced to punt. The Indians
failed to make their distance and
Pierce punted forty yards to Dole,
who ran the ball back twelve
yards. Stanford failed to pierce
the Indian line and Bansbach took
the ball around the end seventeen
yards and first down was made
twice more on line plunges in which
Thompson was used to advantage.
Again Bansbach tried the quarter
back play but was downed two
yards from the line where he
dropped the ball. Pierce punted
fifty yards, but by a series of line
plunges and a long end run by
Chalmers, the hall was carried to
the yard line, where Magee tackled.
Stanford failed to make the yard
in three downs and Pierce again
kicked to safety; but behind splen
did interference on the next play
the quarter-back run was worked
for a touchdown. Smith kicked an
easy goal. Stanford kicked over
the line and the Indians returned
to the middle of the field when time
was called with the ball in Sher
man's possession.
In the second half Pierce kicked
off to Smith, who ran the ball in
fifteen yards. Scholfield made five
yards and Dole punted thirty-five.
The Indians made their downs

twice and then punted to Bansbach,
who was downed without gain.
Stanford went through left tackle
twice for seven yards, and Dole
punted to Cosero, who touched the
ball but allowed it to bounce over
his head. Stillraan secured it and
carried it across the line for a
touchdown. Smith kicked a diffi
cult goal. The last touchdown was
secured just before the game was
called and was made on a series of
line plunges by Thompson and
Scholfield after two end runs by
the quarter-back had placed the
ball within striking distance of the
line. The goal was kicked by
Smith. Score 18-0.

In speaking of the game the Los
Angeles Express said: "It will be
many a day before a cleaner game
of football will be seen in this or
any other city than the one played
at Prager Park . . . . It is
doubtful if there could be a cleaner
game put up by any team . .
From start to finish there was not
a complaint or a solitary action
that was not necessary in the good
playing required to achieve vic
tory."
All of the Los Angeles papers
were enthusiastic over the clean
and sportsmanlike exhibition given
by the Stanford players.
The Sherman Indians were de
feated by Stanford last Thursday
in Los Angeles by the score of 18-0.
Besides the good quality of football
that Stanford men displayed, their
work was remarkable for its ex
treme fairness and absence of all
unsportsmanlike actions. The vic
tory was due almost entirely to the
well developed team work that
enabled the visitors to advance the
ball at will against the loose defen
sive play of the Indians. Stanford
scored three touchdowns and Smith
kicked goal each time. Captain
Bansbach made the first touchdown
on the quarter-back play. Stillman
secured the ball on a fumble two
yards from the Indians' goal and
rolled over the line for the second
touchdown; and the third was
scored by straight line bucking
Bansbach had carried the ball fifty
yards down the field on two suc
cessive quarter-back plays.
The offensive play of the Indians
was superior to their defensive
work, although Sherman held Stan
ford one yard from their goal for
three downs in a fine rally early in
the first half. Bemis Pierce, the
Indian full-back, played a wonder
ful game. His offensive work was
fine, and in backing up the line he
was wonderfully effective against
the dashes of the Stanford backs.
The Cardinal backs played an un
usually good game, although the
effective team work of the eleven
was the main factor in its decisive
victory.
DETAIL OF PLAY.
Sherman won the toss, and Stan
ford kicked to the fifteen-yard line
and forced the Indians to kick.
Pierce kicked fifty-five yards to
Dole, who ran the ball in ten yards
before being downed. Stanford
made first down twice and then
was forced to punt. The Indians
failed to make their distance and
Pierce punted forty yards to Dole,
who ran the ball back twelve
yards. Stanford failed to pierce
the Indian line and Bansbach took
the ball around the end seventeen
yards and first down was made
twice more on line plunges in which
Thompson was used to advantage.
Again Bansbach tried the quarter
back play but was downed two
yards from the line where he
dropped the ball. Pierce punted
fifty yards, but by a series of line
plunges and a long end run by
Chalmers, the hall was carried to
the yard line, where Magee tackled.
Stanford failed to make the yard
in three downs and Pierce again
kicked to safety; but behind splen
did interference on the next play
the quarter-back run was worked
for a touchdown. Smith kicked an
easy goal. Stanford kicked over
the line and the Indians returned
to the middle of the field when time
was called with the ball in Sher
man's possession.
In the second half Pierce kicked
off to Smith, who ran the ball in
fifteen yards. Scholfield made five
yards and Dole punted thirty-five.
The Indians made their downs

twice and then punted to Bansbach,
who was downed without gain.
Stanford went through left tackle
twice for seven yards, and Dole
punted to Cosero, who touched the
ball but allowed it to bounce over
his head. Stillraan secured it and
carried it across the line for a
touchdown. Smith kicked a diffi
cult goal. The last touchdown was
secured just before the game was
called and was made on a series of
line plunges by Thompson and
Scholfield after two end runs by
the quarter-back had placed the
ball within striking distance of the
line. The goal was kicked by
