# "Alumnus" on Honor System.
## 
### 
The Stanford Alumnus ta.kes up
tlie honor system ut some length in
its current issue. A portion of its
editorial is reprinted below, because
it may serve to show what the
graduate feeling is on the new code:
"To the Alumnus it seems that
the movement thus initiated is sig
nificant of the strong and whole
some community spirit that is at
present conspicuously characteristic
of the undergraduate body. As
suming for the moment that the
honor system can he successfully
introduced and maintained, there is
nothing which students could do
that would redound more to their
own nnd the University's credit.
The tone of student sentiment would
be permanently raised and kept at
a high level by the fact that every
one was a keeper and guardian,
not of his alone, but of the
honor and integrity of the whole
student body. Pride in and loyalty
to the University would be strength
ened by the participation of the in
dividual in maintaining its adher
ence to high ideals. Nor is there
any perceptible limit to the degree
of good that student affairs would
receive from so beneficent an insti
tution. A body which will not tol
erate dishonesty in examinations is
not likely to approve of question
able practices in student politics nor
anything less than honest prepara
tions for athletic contests. As
alumni, a body of men and women
that when students had insisted
upon honesty among themselves,
would continue to exert an irresist
ible influence for good upon suc
ceeding generations of undergradu
ates and upon the University itself.
And it is impossible to doubt, too,
that such alumni would have a
more active interest in civic affairs
(which need their interest so badly)
and so would be better citizens for
their practical experience in college.
Such advantages are indeed
"worth twenty football victories."
But in attempting to get them it
should be borne in mind that they
are not to be had merely for the
asking. No one will doubt that a
working honor system is a good
thing. But some may doubt if it
can be secured. It was tried once
at Stanford and failed after a short
time, because of the students' in
difference. Until honesty in exam
inations becomes a cherished tradi
tion, that indifference which is the
bane of so much community endea
vor would be a constant menace.
"That which is everybody's business
is nobody's business" is too often
almost literally true. The other
great obstacle which would have to
be overcome is the reluctance all
students would feel to report delin
quencies. The feeling that one's
duty to the community should over
come the dislike to be "a tale bear
er" is not acquired easily. And
the difficulty may readily multiply
if one's friend is the offender. And

yet, as a practical matter, the suc
cessful operation of the honor sys
tem is bottomed on this: Every
student must regard the honor of
the student body as a personal
trust, and every violator of it as a
criminal against whom he must
bear witness. Nothing less will do.
It is obvious that the introduc
tion of the system is not to be
lightly undertaken, nor its success
ful operation sure. Nevertheless,
because the great good that must
flow from its success would make
even a very doubtful ending worth
risking, and more particularly be
cause the suggestion emanating
from the students themselves, with
out any unusual or conspicuous
event to start it, makes the pros
pect for success especially bright,
we hope it will be given a trial.
