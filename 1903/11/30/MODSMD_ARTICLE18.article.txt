# Fire in Architect's Office.
## 
### 
A small fire occured in Archi
tect Hodges' office in the rear por
tion of the postoffice building this
morning, but no serious damage
was done. The flames were discov
ered shortly after 8 o'clock and an
alarm was blown from the power
house. The flames started from a
leaking oil stove, and from a small
rug spread to the woodwork of the
floor and walls, which were badly
burned in places. A number of
Architect Hodges' plans were
burned, and also a number of his
personal books.
