# Nevada Meets Defeat.
## 
### 
For the third time since its vic
tory over the University of Califor
nia, Nevada has been defeated.
Thanksgiving Day the Nevadans
went down before the Oregon Agri
cultural College by the decisive
score of 15 to 0. The Oregon men
played a punting game until with
in easy striking distance, and then
successfully hammered the Nevada
line. In the first half Nevada lost
left-guard Lawrence, and was con
siderably handicapped in thesecond.
