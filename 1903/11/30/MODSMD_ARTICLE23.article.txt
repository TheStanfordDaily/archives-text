The dance given in Palo Alio
Wednesday evening by the Sigma
Sigma society was a thorough
social success. About seventy-five
couples were in attendance. The
hall was neatly decorated with
pennants of various colleges, pep
per boughs, and yellow chrysanthe
mums arranged in the form of the
Greek letters of the society.
