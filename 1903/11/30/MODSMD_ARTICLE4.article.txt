# NO DEBATE WITH NEVADA.
## Intercollegiate Contest for Stanford Second Team Not Likely This Year. 
### 
Although everything possible has
been done by Stanford toward ar
ranging a debate for the second
team with the University of Ne
vada, it is probable that no contest
will be held this year owing to the
action of Nevada in deciding at the
last moment that if a debate can
not be arranged with the Stanford
Varsity team, none is desired.
The Intersociety Debating League
now has to decide what can be
done regarding the question.
A month ago the Nevada debat
ing manager stated that while they
preferred to debate "Stanford as
Stanford" the Nevada men would
accept a challenge from the Second
team. Since that time a new man
ager has come into control and the
result is a change in Nevada's de
bating policy.
It is now doubtful if Stanford
can arrange for a Second team de
bate this year owing to the short
time remaining in which to carry
on negotiations. Washington has
already been rejected, and the
Southern California colleges have
been assured that no debates with
any of them are possible this year.
