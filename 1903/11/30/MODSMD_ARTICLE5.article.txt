# Second Chamber Concert.
## 
### 
On account of the near approach
of the end of the semester the Mu
sic Committee has considered it
preferable to give the second cham
ber concert in January rather than
during next month. The next
event will be a quartette concert,
and a very attractive program is
being arranged. The concert will
be given between the middle and
the end of January.
