# UNDERGRADUATE ON SYSTEM.
## Princeton Senior Writes Opinion of Students on Honor Code. 
### 
Since it was realized that the
opinion of the students themselves
on the honor system was of para
mount importance in showing the
success of the system, expressions
were asked from two or three under
graduates of Princeton as to what
was the sentiment of the students
there on the matter. In a letter
received, the following statements
are given:
"Ever since the adoption of the
Honor System some seven or eight
years ago, every Princeton man has
taken especial personal interest and
pride in maintaining it inviolate.
In all this time only three men
have been known to violate their
pledge, and the consequences which
they suffered in the way of ostra
cism by the entire undergraduate
body and expulsion were most se
vere. The stigma attached to the
violation of the system is so severe
that an offender could never return
to Princeton.
"Some of the advantages to the
student body are, that a man may
leave the room at will, talk to any
person, besides escaping the annoy
ance of being under the constant
surveillance of the professor, who
usually is only in the room part of
the time to answer questions.
"If the students of Stanford enter
into the spirit of the honor system
and adopt it, I am sure you will
appreciate the many advantages
accruing thereby to both faculty
and undergraduates."
