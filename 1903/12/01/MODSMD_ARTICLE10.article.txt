Dr. Jordan states that there is no
truth in the report printed by a
San Francisco paper a few days ago
to the effect that the Cooper Medi
cal College would be affiliated with
Stanford University. The relations
of the two institutions have always
been cordial, but it has been the
policy of the University not to
affiliate itself with any institution
which it does not control, and no
departure from this rule will be
made in this instance.
