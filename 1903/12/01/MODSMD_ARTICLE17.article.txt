A mass meeting of the students
is called for Thursday morning in
Assembly Hall for the purpose of
discussing the adoption of the
honor system. Since the proposal
of a change in the present method
of dealing with dishonesty in ex
aminations has come entirely from
the students themselves, Thurs
day's meeting is to be wholly a
student gathering, called that the
honor code may have a thorough
discussion both by those for and
against the system. Members of
the faculty and persons not con
nected with the student body will
not be present, so thatstudents will
be perfectly free to enter into a
frank discussion of the proposal.
Some objections to the change are
based on the fact that on the end
of examination papers a pledge
that aid has not been given or
received is repulsive. It lias never
entered the minds of those who are
most strongly advocating student
control of cheating that such a
pledge is necessary. In fact, the
objection to this feature is quite
general, because the additional
guarantee of integrity is entire
ly superfluous if the (Stanford stu
dents decide to adopt the honor
system. This pledge will undoubt
edly never enter into the applica
tion of student control, for every
Stanford man has faith that if the
system bejonce adopted the entire
undergraduate body now and in
the future will make it so strong
and sacred a tradition of the Uni
versity that any violation of its
terms will be looked upon in the
light of a most extraordinary occur
ence. Those who are against the
honor system say that it will not
work because the students can not
be expected to enforce its provis
ions, â€”that no one will report viola
tions to the student committee. In
a measure that argument is met
by the assertion that the great
value of the honor system lies in

the fact that it will do away with
cheating. This is,going to be true
after the system has once been
firmly grounded as a tradition,
but those who say that the Stan
ford students will not maintain a
code of honor that they themselves
have seen fit to establish as a vital
part of the University cast a re
flection on the moral consciousness
of every Stanford man and woman.
The students will no more hesitate
to report a man for cheating than
would a captain refrain from dis
missing one who had violated the
confidence of the university by
breaking training rules. The ulti
mate and continuous success of the
honor system at Stanford will rest
entirely upon the unanimity with
which they ask for the change.
