# Art Exhibit Closes.

### 
Mr. Sekko Shimada closed his
exhibition of Japanese art in the
studio today. Yesterday afternoon
he showed how Japanese pictures
are made, and illustrated hy sev
eral drawings tlie wonderful rapid
ity, clearness, and fine coloring
characteristic of the making of his
pictures. The demonstration was
very well attended, as were the
general exhibitions. Shimada will
perhaps give similar exhibitions
twice a year in the future. All of
his smaller pictures have been sold
and many orders taken for other
drawings.
The ''Waves 1 ' and ,4 Fish" pic
tures are representative of his
school. To get the perfect idea of
motion and water effect in the fish
pictures Shimada studied them by
going down into the sea in a diving
suit. Many conventional Japan
ese subjects are shown, such aw the
"Geese and the Moon," and"the
Crow Eating a Butterfly," etc.
Some of the pictures are so thor
oughly European in treatment that
it is hard to see any Japanese
touches, as in the small moonlight
scene and the "Waves." The com
plementary color scheme so char
acteristic of Japanese work is best
shown in the picture of the green
parrot and red leaves. Shimada
considers his best drawing to be the
large one of the fish and autumn
leaves. To get the effect of the
waves he studied the waterfall near
the temple of Nikko in Japan for
days. The next exhibition will
probably be sometime in the spring.
