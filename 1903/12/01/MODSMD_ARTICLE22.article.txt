It is reported from Los Angeles
that K. \Y. Darling, ex-05, is inau
gerating a crusade in the city in
favor of simplicity of life. He has
been preaching in the streets, and

iiis restatement of the gospel of
Thoreau and of Raskin is causing
considerable comment. Darling
was formerly a student in the de
partment of Ethics under Professor
E. H. Griggs. Last year he lived
at "Alto Study," near College Ter
