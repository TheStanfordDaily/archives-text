# REV. GARDNER PREACHES.
## Sermon in Memorial Church Deals with Personal Idea of Religion. 
### 
At the morning service in Me
morial Church Sunday Chaplain
Gardner preached from the text,
"And this is life eternal, that they
might know thee, the only true
God." The preacher laid down as
a fundamental proposition the idea
that religion is a conscious personal
relation established between the
soul and God. He appealed to the
many eloquent expressions of this
idea of personal religion in history,
quoting the psalmist David, the
patriarch Job, the saint Augustine,
and W. E. Gladstone, the states
man. Mr. Gladstone's testimony
was most pertinent. When asked
a short time before his death his
greatest hope for the future, the
great English commoner replied,
"I should say we must look for
that to the maintenance of faith in
the invisible, and by that I mean a
living faith in a personal God.
After sixty years of public life I
hold more strongly to this convic
tion, deepened and strengthened by
long experience, of the reality and
the nearness and the personality of
God."
The preacher then dealt with sin
as the disrupting principle in
man's spiritual life. If God's will
is the aim which every good man
should pursue, then sin is a missing
of the true goal. It ia not simply
something said or done in contra
diction to God's law; it is the oppo
sition of will to the pure will of
God. The sermon concluded with
a plea for the habit of prayer as
that invigorating principle which
would best sustain and develop
ma true relation to God.
The address at the organ recital
was on "The Contributions of Re
ligion to the Gifts of Civilization."
