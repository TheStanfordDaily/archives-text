# HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS.
## Method of Applying: Honor Code in Examinations Shown Below. 
### 
One of the Princeton undergrad
uates has sent the honor system
leaflet, copies of which are handed
to every freshman the day he ar
rives at that university. An ex
plicit statement of what the sys
tem means to Princeton is given in
addition to what is expected of ev
ery man who enters that institu
tion. Besides this method of ac
quainting the entering student with
the sacredness of the strongest tra
ditions, the university sets aside a
portion of the first student mass
meeting for the full explanation of
the honor system. The essential
features of the leaflet are given be
low :
"Several years ago the students
of Princeton, realizing that the
standard of honor in examinations
was low, decided in a mass meet
ing to raise that standard by the
adoption of what is known ae the
'Honor System.' This system
places every man on his honor, and
rules provide for the summary
punishment of anyone who shall
violate the trust reposed in him.
The movement to which the system
owes its birth was eminently a stu
dents' movement, and from the
first the undergraduates have
heartily sustained it. At intervals
since its adoption the system has
been put to thorough tests, and in
no instance has the student body
failed to endorse the action of the
committee of undergraduates hav
ing in charge the trial of offenders.
"The substance of the honor sys
tem, the rules of which govern all
examinations in the university, is
as follows:
"Every student is required, upon
each of his examination papers, to
sign the following pledge: 'I pledge
my honor as a gentleman that, dur
ing this examination, I have nei
ther given nor received assistance.'
"This includes any unfair means
that may be used at any time,
such as the procuring of examina
tion papers before examination,
etc., etc.
"Any man accused of violating
either the letter or the spirit of the
law, will be tried before an under
graduate committee, consisting of
the four class presidents and two
other members chosen, one from
the senior and one from the junior
class.
"If found guilty,he will be recom
mended to the faculty for expul
sion.
"The responsibility of keeping in
violate the honor system, the most
essential feature of Princeton life
and the most sacred of Princeton
customs, rests with the students
themselves, and it is only by the
true realization of this responsibil
ity that the system can be main
tained. Therefore it is the duty of
every man, regardless of any per
sonal feeling he may have in the
matter, to see that any offense
which may come under his notice
is investigated. In order to do
this he must consult at once with
the committee in charge, and the
man who fails in this is as truly
an offender against the honor sys

tem as the man who, after pledging
his word of honor as a gentleman,
deliberately breaks it.
"Ever since its adoption, the
honor system has been eminently
successful in accomplishing the
purpose for which it was originated,
viz., to place examinations in
Princeton on a perfectly honorable
basis, and it remains for every
student to do his share in main
taining this high standard."
