Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Your advocacy of the honor sys
tem in examinations is a move to
make confidence and mutual respect
stronger between faculty and stu
dents. It of special interest to
those of us who have recently left
college. If the men and women of
Stanford are treated as persons of
principle, they will give full return
for any confidence shown in them.
Under such an arrangement as the
one proposed, a student proving
himself so depraved as to violate
honesty would suddenly realize
that he did not belong on the cam
pus. Should violations of honor
occur after the system is putin
force, they would have to be inves
tigated by strong and fearless men.
It would be no matter of play to
probe charges against those with
whom you are daily associated.
But to one who is fond of the idea
of stalwart manhood and woman
hood he carries from Stanford, the
thought of violation seems almost
impossible. Give the Stanford stu
dent a chance to prove his self
reliance and his capabilities. Let
him know that you believe he is
governed by principle. Permit him
to stand on his own feet without
the watchfulness of nursery disci
pline and he will show that he
appreciates the privilege of lending
honor to the name of his Univer
sity. Allow him to display the
high sense of honor that is his, and
he will free the campus from any
human mistakes that may have
found their way into the the stu
dent body.
