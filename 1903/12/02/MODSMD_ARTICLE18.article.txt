Every student in the University
should be at the mass meeting to
morrow morning in Assembly Hall.
The honor system is a vital ques
tion that concerns the entire body
of undergraduates, and entirely
for the purpose of discussing the
proposal the mass meeting is called.
It is hoped that students will speak
both for and against the honor code,
as only in this way can every mis
understanding be cleared up. An
open discussion will be carried on
after the introductory remarks, and
those who have anything to say on
the matter should not hesitate to
speak. The communications from
Dr. Jordan and Dr. Farrand, print
ed in today's Daily Palo Alto,
are most significant expressions as
showing the attitude of the faculty.
Dr. Jordan has struck the keynote
by saying that cheating will be
done away with because of the
"social chill" that will meet those
who cheat. Dr. Farrand's expres
sions as to the feelings between
faculty and studentsare exceedingly
pertinent, and give an idea of what
the attitude of students and faculty
should be. Opinions from men of
the type of Dr. Jordan and Dr.
Farrand may be taken as the views
of the entire faculty. Such opin
ions are not ordinary ones. They
show the depth to which the discus
sion has proceeded, and in addition
point out the very strongest reason
why Stanford should adopt the
honor system.
