The poor financial response that
is attending the efforts of those stu
dents who are circulating subscrip
tion lists for the tennis fund is
most unfortunate. Besides the
moral obligation that rests with
every man to redeem the pledge he
gave last year at the time the list
was first circulated, there is another
consideration of great importance.
The one good tennis court now at
the disposal of the candidates for
the team is entirely inadequate to
meet the needs of the players. In
the past tennis has received but
little financial support at the hands
of the student body, but the Exec
utive Committee has come forward
with an offer so generous as to
ensure the permanent welfare of
the sport if the students will only
contribute their share. Stanford's
record in the intercollegiate tennis
matches of the last few years has
been far from enviable. Nor can
the men who labored against the
almost impossible handicap of poor
courts be blamed for the failure to
win victories. This season there
has been manifested an unusual
interest in the sport. There is one
good court in existence, and the
promise of two new ones if the
debt on the old be paid off. Under
this set of conditions the necessity
of paying up the subscription lists
appears. A generous response on
the part of the student body will
mean that tennis will be placed on
a firm and permanent footing.
