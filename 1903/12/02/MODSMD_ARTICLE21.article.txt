Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The greatest opposition to the
honor system which I have heard
has come from students who have
known of the system only in high
schools where it was imposed upon
the pupils by the faculty solely as
a means of detecting cheating in
examinations. It is quite natural
that failure should result when the
system is put upon such a basis.
The honor system when adopted by
the students themselves, as an ex
pression of their own attitude
towards their school or university,
is an entirely different matter. In
one Western university the honor
system was voted down when the
faculty tried to force its adoption,
the students protesting that it was
unnecessary; yet seniors in that
university tell me that they have
taken few examinations during
their college course where they
have not seen cheating going on
around them. With the spirit at
present existing here, the adoption
of the honor system, if it came
spontaneously from the student
body, would be simply an expres
sion of the opinion of the college
public, which would yet have the
authority back of it to give such
an expression force. ]t would show
a maturer sense of responsibility on
the part of the students than has
yet been evidenced in some matters;
and this would beyond a doubt be
met with privileges and responsi
bilities in many matters now out
side of student control. More
dignified relations between faculty
and students would be possible;
the professor would not have to
hold himself ready to do detective
work, when the Stanford student
body comes out openly and says
that it stands for squareness, and
stands for it strongly enough to in
vestigate infringements of honor, if
such should occur. But it is hard
to believe that infringements would
occur when they would be viola
tions of established tradition and
of Stanford spirit.
