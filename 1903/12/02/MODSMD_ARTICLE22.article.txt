Editor Daily Palo Alto:
There are now in the hands of
the students a number of subscrip
tion lists to pay for the tennis
court that was laid down last year.
The proposition is this: There were
subscriptions promised last year
that were never collected, and as a
result there is a debt of $'280 still
due on the court. The Executive
Committee has generously 1 made
the following offer: If the debt of
$280 be paid, the committee prom
ises to advance $250 on two new
oil courts. Here is a chance that
we should not let pass. During
the past years tennis has received
very little attention. The present
situation is no better. The one
court we ha ve is entirely inadequate
to the needs of the players, and

there are more men who take an
active part in tennis than in any
other branch of athletics. Nowith
standing thefact, tennis has received
almost no financial support. Here
is a chance to put tennis on a good
firm basis. With two new courts
we would be in fairly good shape
to train up a team. As things now
stand this is practically impossible.
If the student body will pay up on
the subscriptions that are now out,
there will be enough to pay off the
old debt, and thus secure two new
courts. Committee.
