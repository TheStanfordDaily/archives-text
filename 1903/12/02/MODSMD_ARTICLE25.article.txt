# ROYAL ITALIAN BAND.
## Concert Will Be Given Friday Night for Third Successive Year. 
### 
Ellery's Royal Italian Band,
which will appear in Assembly
Hall Friday evening, is well known
to Stanford audiences. The con
certs given on two previous occa
sions have been artistic as well as
financial successes.
Mr. Ellery, who has been the
dominating influence in the bind
since its inception, is a man of
discriminating musical tempera
ment coupled with a good manage
rial instinct that enables him to
offer the best classical and popular
selections. Carrying out his policy
of making changes both in the
direct leadership and the personnel
of the band when such changes
seem to offer hope of improvement,
Ellery has given the baton to Man
fred Chiaffarelli. The new leader
is a graduate of the Royal Conser
vatory at Bologna, and he carries
with him a reputation for true
musical ability rather than the
possession of the repertoire of tricks
that are usually brought into play
by band leaders.
The solo parts in the concert will
be carried by Signori Decimo and
Ferullo, clarinet and oboe, and
Signori Palma, Di Natale and Curti,
trumpet, trombone, and baritone.
The program to be given this
year is an improvement over the
ones rendered on previous occa
sions. The lovers of classic music
will find much to appreciate in
Mozart's overture, "Magic Flute,"
Wagner's "Albumblatt," and Gou
nod's prelude "Faust"; while
those who have a preference for
popular airs are to be offered selec
tions from "La Traviata," "Car
men," and a number of original
compositions by Chiaffarelli.
The advance sale of seats is pro
gressing favorably at the Book
store and at the Stanford Phar
macy in Palo Alto. The program
will he published in full in tomor
row's Daily Palo Alto.
