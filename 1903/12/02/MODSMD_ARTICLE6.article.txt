# PRESIDENT JORDAN WRITES.
## States His Reasons Why Honor System Will Do Much for Stanford. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Stanford University has always
stood in the front of educational
progress. It has been ready to try
new experiments and to try again
if these fail. It has steadily moved
in the direction of self-government
by the students. It is the business
of the faculty to teach as well as
they know how, to exact high
standards, and to see that the
Stanford degree does not go to the
idler, the dullard, or the trick
ster.
By the honor system, the stu
dents, who are as deeply interested
as the faculty in maintaining the
value of Stanford degrees, propose
to take the latter part out of the
faculty's hands. The faculty are
doubtless willing. I have not yet
consulted them, but we wish it to
be a spontaneous movement. We
do not wish to force the matter upon
the student body.
The success of the honor system
does not depend much on student
reporting. It depends on the so
cial chill which will meet the man
who tries to cheat. The same stu
dent sentiment which condemns
the breaking of physical training
rules will grow sensitive to the
breaking of moral and intellectual
rules of the same kind. These are
not the work of any faculty com
mittee —they are inherent in honest
education. It is only a matter of
time when the honor system will
become a matter of course in our
colleges. Broad freedom of self
control always implies impartial
severity towards those who abuse
such freedom. If the student com
mittees can deal impartially with
the first few cases which may come
up, there will never be any more.
Rut the first cases will be the cru
cial ones, —to send away a man of
your own set, of your own team,
of your own family. If you can
do this once or twice, the honor of
the University will be in safe
hands. David Starr Jordan.
