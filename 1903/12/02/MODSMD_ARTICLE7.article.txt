# Dr. Farrand on Honor System.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The advantages that would re
sult from the introduction of the
honor system at Stanford seem to
be generally conceded, and the ob
jections that are raised are against
certain features only. While I am
so partisan an advocate as to think
that these objectionable features
would prove imaginary or at least
greatly exaggerated, when the sys
tem was put into actual operation,
I believe that such questions must
be considered and determined by
the students themselves.
It might not be amiss, however,
to point out a possible advantage,
that thus far seems to have escaped
notice. If the students voluntarily
adopt and successfully carry out
a policy whereby they may be
trusted by the faculty, will not the
faculty be obliged to act so that
they may be trusted by the stu
dents? Many of the instructors
are over-burdened, and, to get from
their classes the requisite amount
of work, they require set papers or

other tests which they have no in
tention of examining. The absence
of the honor system does not justify
dishonorable methods and there is
no excuse for one student submit
ting the work of another as his
own, but it is hard to do work for
which one is to get no credit, and if
there is room for improvement in
this respect on the part of the stu
dents, there is also room for
improvement on the part of the
instructors. The relations which
now exist in many instances be
tween faculty and students are
intolerable. Twenty honor systems
would never endow some men with
an atom of tact, but in so far as
these strained relations are due to
mutual suspicion, there is ground
for hope. If the system under dis
cussion contains the possibility of
bettering these conditions, I am in
favor of its adoption for this reason
alone.
In connection with the present
agitation the question of student
control is being raised. If it is of
any interest to you to know it, I
can assure you that there are many
members of the faculty who are as
desirous of giving the students
complete control of their own
affairs as the students are to get it.
And we regard the adoption of the
honor system as the first step in
that direction. Max Farrand.
