# RECEIPTS FROM GAME.
## Los Angeles Contest Netted One Thousand Dollars to Student Body. 
### 
From the football game played
in Lob Angeles Thanksgiving Day
between Stanford and the Ferris
Indians the Stanford student body
received one thousand dollars and
all expenses of the team. The lat
ter amounted to about -$750, so
that the total amount of money
which Stanford received from the
southern trip was approximately
$1750. This amount figured to
about 40 per cent of the total gate
receipts, which was the proportion
offered Stanford on a division
basis as an alternative for the
guarantee of $1000 and expenses.
With the election of a football
captain for next year, which
will occur tomorrow night, the
football season will close. At
present no negotiations are
pending for a game during the holi
days, and there remains little or
no chance of Stanford's entering
any gridiron contest at that time.
Had the team remained intact a
game could have been scheduled
with any one of several eastern
teams. The Carlisle Indians
would have been the choice.
