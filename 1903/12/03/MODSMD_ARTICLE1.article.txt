# DISCUSS HONOR SYSTEM.
## Mass Meeting This Morning Devoted to Student Control of Cheating. 
### 
Practically the entire student
body, men and women, met in
Assembly Hall this morning to
discuss the question of adopting
the honor system at Stanford.
After Dr. Jordan had made the
opening address, the meeting was
left entirely in the hands of the
students. Addresses for and against
the system were made by twelve
men, and two women spoke in favor
of it. F. Roehr, '04, president of the
student body, presided.
Dr. Jordan in introducing the
subject said in part: "The faculty
are not behind the project; it was
brought to me as a complete sur
prise. We are not averse to trying
experiments at Stanford Univer
sity. We want to be in the front
in all things. It has been said
that we are not in need of the
honor system, but there is a con
stant drifting toward it, and I re
gard the system as inevitable in all
our colleges. The faculty is here
for three things—to teach, to carry
on investigation, and to prevent
any idler, dullard, or trickster
from getting a degree. The pur
pose of the honor system is to re
lieve the faculty of the duty of
looking after the trickster. The
crucial test of the honor system is
in its beginning. When one of the
football heroes cheats, will you
report him ? The success of the
system depends upon there being
no pull."
The second speech for the system
was made by O. A. Wilson. '04,
who, after explaining the system
and its workings, said: "If every
objecting student will refrain from
placing personal dislike to telling —
mere personal considerations —
above the greater ones of good to
his University, there is no doubt
but that every vestige of disapprov
al will vanish. If we adopt the
honor system, every student must
at once consider the reporting of
cheating as a duty that he owes to
his fellow students, to his Univer
sity, —and not as an irksome task to
be avoided. Upon the students
themselves depends the success of
the code. If we are for it, we must
adopt the honor method with such
unanimity that its complete
and ultimate success will be as
sured from the first. If careful
thought is given, if impartial con
sideration is bestowed, if personal
dislikes will only give way to the
greater considerations, no one need
have the least doubt that the Stan
ford man and Stanford woman will
rise to the occasion."
B. P. Oak ford, '01, said in part:
"I belong to the Law department
where it is said the honor system
is not needed. Yet if the Univer
sity as a whole needs a change, the
law students will be for it. But
are the existing conditions such
that we need a radical change? Is
the system under discussion going
to develop such honor and charac
ter as we speak of ? You cannot
make a man moral by statute.
The great question to be considered
in connection with the honor sys
tem is whether it would work here.

For its success there are two requi-1
sites: first, the absolute support of
the student body and of the indi
vidual. The student body must
l)e behind it unanimously. A two
thirds or three-quarters vote is
essential. As to the individual
attitude, if every man is not will
ing to go the full length in carry
ing out his duty, the system will
fail. But we can develop here a
new honor system, an honor sys
tem that is the Stanford pledge.
Let it come from within, not be
put on."
C. B. Wooster, '03, spoke briefly
in favor of the system, and was
followed by C. 1). McComish, '03.
McComish said he was opposed to
the introduction of the system be
cause he did not believe it neces
sary at Stanford. "If we adopt
the honor system and it fails," he
said, "it would be worse than if
we had not attempted it. Unless
there is some necessity, the people
won't take enough interest in it to
make it a success."
0. H. Hitter, '04, spoke in favor
of the plan. He said: "If the
system can be putin vogue prop
erly it would be a success. It is
only a question of whether the
students will support it. It can
only be a success by the unani
mous support of the whole student
body."
Miss Alice Holman. '06, said:
"The honor system seems entirely
in accordance with what has been
done at Stanford in the past. A
thing that is voted unanimously
by the student body must be
founded on democratic principles
and must succeed."
H. A. Moran, '04, said he did
not believe the honor system was
the proper thing for Stanford.
"We know that some professors
here give examinations and go
away," he said. "This will come
more and more, and I think that
is what we want."
M. H. Thorpe,'os, spoke strongly
in favor of the plan. "With the
honor system the best men in col
lege will not cheat. There will be
a feeling that makes cheating im
possible. It will be a sentiment
that will grow into a tradition and
a tradition that will be one of
Stanford's most cherished cus
toms."
Captain Bansbach of the foot
ball team said he thought the sys
tem would be one of the greatest
things that ever came to Stanford.
Captain Ball of the baseball team
also said he believed the system
would result in much good.
H. P. Kuhn, '04, spoke in behalf
of the honor system. He cited
some instances to show how the
wide student control of examina
tions would be of great benefit, and
he appealed for prompt and united
action.
J. S. Swartzlander, '04, favored
an honor system without a report
ing system. Miss Blanche Myer,
'07, spoke in favor of the plan, and
J. A. Merrill, '04, against it.
After these addresses the meeting
adjourned.
