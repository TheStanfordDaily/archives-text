Those who persist in basing
their objections to the honor sys
tem on the fact that a pledge is re
quired of every student to report
offenders and another pledge on
the end of each examination paper
that no aid has been given or re
ceived, are fighting the biggest kind
of a shadow. There is absolutely
no intention of having any. pledge
whatever, either on the part of the
general student to report cases of
dishonesty or on examination pa
pers. Enough has been done if the
Stanford student body vote to
adopt the system. The mere fact
that it declares that it will main
tain the honor code is sufficient
guaranty that every student will
respond to the duty that affiliation
with Stanford men and women
reposes in him. No one who is
advocating the change is in favor
of the pledge, because it is believed
to be entirely repugnant and un
necessary. It should be known
from the start that the pledge por
tion will never find any place in
the system if the opinions of most
of the students are to be taken.
Those who withhold support from
student control of cheating because
they maintain that no one will re
port on fellow students lose their
faith in the integrity of the stu
dents by implying that the Stan
ford man will consider frivolously
the maintenance of his own tradi
tions.
