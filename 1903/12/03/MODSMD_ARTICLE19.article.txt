Editor Daily Palo Alto:
There is considerable talk re
cently endorsing honor systems
with the system left out. May 1
venture the opinion that this theory
is, like so many noble theories, de
fective only in that it will not
work? The evolutionary forma
tion of an honor sentiment would
probably work very well if the
whole student body could be raised
on the campus. But our students
come from the preparatory schools
of the wide, wicked world, some of
which have very low standards of
honor. With the proposed honor
system, without the system, how
are the new men who have been
accustomed to look upon cheating
as quite the proper thing, to be
come cognizant that they have
changed atmospheres? Is it not
likely that under the evolutionary
honor system they would cheat for
a year or two before becoming
oriented? With all due respect
for the lofty ideals of those who
advocate honor without the sys
tem, it may be said, I think, that
the establishment of some sort of a
system is absolutely essential to
guarantee a uniform honor stand
ard in a shifting population, where
the community generation is only
four years in length. Its inaug
uration would give the present stu
dent body a needed opportunity to
inform the unassorted raw material
which comes each year to our
doors that it is the custom not to
cheat at Stanford; that the men
and women of Stanford are banded
against all forms of cheating; this
in self defense and in defense of the
good name of their alma mater.
