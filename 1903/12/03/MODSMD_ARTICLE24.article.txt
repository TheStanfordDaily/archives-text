# Second Team Sweaters.
## 
### 
The Athletic Committee at a
meeting last night, awarded the
football sweaters to the Varsity
substitutes and Second team men.
The following received sweaters:
Butterfield, '04, Hyde, '04. Mon
zingo, '05, Van Sickle, '05, Still
man, '05, I). Tarpey, '05, Butter
field, '07, Stephenson,'o7, Dole, '07,
Brennan, '07, Stott, '07.
It was decided to award the
black emblem formerly given only
to Varsity substitutes to all the
players this year, instead of the
usual white German "S" which
has formerly been awarded to
Second team men. The change is
due to the fact that the entire
Second team was on the sidelines
as substitutes at the big game. By
a change in the system of coaching
this year the Second team used the
same code of signals as the Varsity
and so the men were virtually all
Varsity substitutes.
