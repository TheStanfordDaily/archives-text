# LECTURES ON BENTHAM.
## Dr. Abbott Last Night Gave First of Talks on Great Lawyers. 
### 
Before an audience of a hundred
and fifty law students, Dr. Abbott
last night delivered the first of his
series of lectures on great lawyers.
The lecture was a review of the life
and work of Jeremy Bentham.
In beginning Dr. Abbott men
tioned several of the greatest En
glish lawyers and showed how
materially they had been influenced
by Bentham. In continuing, the
speaker dwelt on Bentham's early
school life at Westminster and at
Oxford, giving a brief summary of
his early experience in law, which
resulted in determination to reform
the unjust laws of the day. He
said in part:
"Bentham was a prime factor in
repealing the fated bankruptcy law,
and also in revising the criminal
laws of the latter part of the eigh
teenth century. Bentham edited a
long series of useful books which
stimulated scientific legislation on
the continent to a great degree.
Macaulay, when he was sent to
draft laws for India, installed laws
directly traceable to Bentham. The
value of his work was keenly ap
preciated by his contemporaries
and successors."
In closing Dr. Abbott urged the
Stanford law students to rise above
the aim of ordinary lawyers and
try for real greatness, as Bentham,
Austin, and others have done.
