# FORM OF BALLOT.
## Wording of Proposals for Honor System to Be Voted on Wednesday. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students this afternoon
adopted the following form of pre
senting the honor system at the
election Wednesday. The propos
als as given below will be printed
in full on the ballots.
Shall we adopt an honor system
that provides for student control of
cheating in examinations ?
Student control means that one
1. Shall not take or give aid in
examinations, and
2. Shall use his influence to pre
vent either.
No pledge will be required of the
individual as to the performance of
his duty.
Cases of violation shall be investi
gated by a committee of students,
the number, manner of selection,
and other details of which shall be
arranged by a temporary committee
of five students, two to be selected
by the President of the University,
two by the Executive Committee,
and one to be selected by these four.
