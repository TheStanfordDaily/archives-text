# Registrar Soon to Move.
## 
### 
The Registrar's office will move
into its new quarters in the old
geology building before the begin
ning of next semester. Carpenters
have been busy for some weeks
reconstructing the interior of the
building, and their work will soon
be completed. A large room has
been built in one corner. This
room will be used by Dr. Elliott as
his working-room, and will also
serve as the meeting-place of the
scholarship and entrance commit
tees. Another corner has been
divided off as a meeting-place for
the teachers' bureau. Across the
center of the room a long desk will
be placed for the transaction of
general business. This desk will
contain a large number of drawers
for the filing and preservation of
records. In addition to securing
much more space, the Registrar will
have the advantage of better light
than the old quarters afforded.
The rooms which the Registrar
is abandoning will be occupied by
President Jordan, whose present
small room will be put to some
other use. It is proposed to effect
all these changes before the open
ing of the spring semester.
