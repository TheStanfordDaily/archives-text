The action of the Executive Com
mittee in deciding to have the
honor system voted on at the elec
tion Wednesday should receive the
careful attention of every student.
Especiall}' important is it that
close thought should be put on the
proposals of the system to be voted
on. Just what, every one is to
vote on is clearly expressed in the
clauses printed elsewhere. The
general question of the adoption of
the system as a system will be put
before the;students, and the details
of carrying out the preliminary
stages of the system are provided
for in the selection of a temporary
committee of five students chosen
in a way to secure absolute confi
dence. It will be noticed that the
question of a-pledge is left out en
tirely and no student will be re
quired to pledge himself that he has
neither given"; nor received aid, nor
will be asked to sign any pledge to
report those whom he sees cheating.
Some criticism has arisen over
clause two, providing that every
student "shall use his influence,"
etc. The wording is deemed too
indefinite by,';some. For the bene
fit of those who object to this
clause it may be said that if the
disapproval is general the Execu
tive Committee will undoubtedly
be glad to receive suggestions from

anyone as to modifications of the
wording of this particular sentence
before the proposals go on the
ballots.
