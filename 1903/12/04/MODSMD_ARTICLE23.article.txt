Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Much of late has been said con
cerning the honor system, hut as
yet few of the arguments for the
other side have appeared in the
Daily Palo Alto.
It seems to me that we are not
so concerned over the success of
the honor system in other colleges
as we are interested in its working
right here in Stanford at the pres
ent time. It is urged against the
'"honor system with the system left
out" that it is defective only he
cause it will not work. This state
ment is not only arbitrary, but is
inconsistent with the arguments
put forth by the very men who up
hold the proposed system. These
men say that we have the honor
system in the Law department and
assert that it is a success. True
enough, but it is also "honor with
the system left out." In this de
partment there is nothing said
about reporting or pledges. The
professor simply shows by his ac
tions that he trusts the members
of his classes, and from the testi
mony of the law students and
faculty this system has been and
still is a success. Now, if a sys
tem that succeeds in the Law de
partment will not work in the
others, it must be for one of two
reasons: either the law students
possess a higher sense of honor
than the students in the other
classes, or else those students have
not been made to feel that they are
trusted by their instructors. If
the law students have a higher
sense of honor than the rest of the
student body, it has certainly been
acquired since the}' entered the
University, and this being the case
it must be because they feel that
they are trusted. Now if this
theory—whose only defect is that
it will not work —does work in the
Law department, and in some of
the other courses in Stanford Uni
versity; if it does work in the Uni
versity of Virginia why not put it
into practice, for a time at least,
and then if it fails we can consider
the inauguration of the reporting
system. Louis Gonsalvks, '05.
