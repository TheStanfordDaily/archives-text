## Old Psychological Laboratory Will be Fitted to Accommodate Patients. 
### 
The brick building across the
road from Eecondite Cottage, for
merly used as a psychological labor
atory, has been fitted up as a de
tention hospital. The Student
Guild will assume entire charge of
the new hospital, and will conduct
it on the same lines as the Guild
Hospital in Palo Alto. The build
ing is admirably constructed for
its present purpose. It is of brick;
the heating and lighting facilities
are excellent; the ventilation is all
that can be desired. The place has
been completely renovated and the
wards and service rooms putin
good order. Rooms have been re
served for the nurses, a corps of
whom sufficient to take care of the
number of patients now in the
hospital arrived today. Enough
rooms have been opened to pro
vide for twenty patients.
Several patients were removed to
the hospital this afternoon, and
others who may show any sign of
serious throat trouble will follow
them. None of the patients taken
to the hospital are certainly afflict
ed with diphtheria, but sincethere
are so many cases of tonsilitis, the
health authorities intend to adopt
stringent measures to stamp out
the threatened epidemic.
