The following is a copy of a let
ter received by President Jordan:
Dear Sir: On November 30th 1
posted a statement concerning the
presence in the community of nu
merous cases of tonsilitis, and ad
vising all students having nose or
throat "colds" to report to me or to
one of the local physicians.
This suggestion has been very
generally acted upon by the stu
dents, but the concurrent develop
ment of a number of cases of diph
theria now makes it imperative that
all members of the community suf
fering from nose or throat affections,
however slight, should place them
selves under the observation of a
physician at once. The opinion of
a physician is especially essential,
as the early stages of tonsilitis and
diphtheria cannot be differentiated
by the students.
Every precaution is being taken
to prevent the spread of the disease,
and I suggest the posting of an of
ficial statement from your office
only in pursuance of your policy
of keeping the students fully in
formed of the situation in such cir
cumstances, and in the interest of
general safely.
The gravity of the situation lies

entirely in what it may become
through negligence, not in what it
is at present.
Prompt action on the part of
every student in reporting all con
ditions of ill health is all that is
required in controlling the situa
tion.
A detention hospital has been
equipped, and a number of persons
are being quarantined in it simply
for purposes of community protec
tion. Those students suffering
from the disease are isolated under
the care of special nurses and are
in no instances dangerously ill.
Tonsilitis does not develop into
diphtheria, and it is not true that
the recent tonsilitis cases are all
"verging on diphtheria."
Approved, W. F. Snow.
David S. Jordan, Pres.
