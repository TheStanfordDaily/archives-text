# DIPHTHERIA SITUATION.
## Physicians Believe Epidemic is Under Control.â€” Few New Cases. 
### 
The small diphtheria epidemic
that has developed at the Univer
sity during the past few days does
not show any alarming growth.
Dr. Snow says that while a few
more eases may develop, he does
not regard the situation as threat
ening. He does not believe that
any necessity of closing the Uni
versity will arise. He denies also
that there will he any general
quarantine of the campus.
There are at the present time nine
cases of diphtheria in the old psy
chology laboratory, which has been
fitted up as a temporary detention
hospital, and six men are being
held there on suspicion that they
have incipient cases of the disease.
Those who are suffering from well
defined cases of the disease are as
follows: W. J. Neidig, instructor
in English; W. A. Manning, in
structor in Mathematics; Stephen
Taber, '0(5, C. S. Sherwood, '07,
H. R. Wilde, '07, H. E. Savage.
'05, J. C. Ray, '07, Miss E. M.
Reeves, '05, Miss O. E. Neal, '05.
Ray was taken to the detention
hospital late Sunday night from
his home on Alvarado row. Miss
Reeves and Miss Neal were taken
from Roble Hall, and Taber, Sher
wood. and Savage from Encina
Hall. Wilde and Instructor Man
ning lived in Palo Alto, and
Instructor Neidig on Alvarado row.
Those who are held as suspects
are H. L. Morrison, '04, J. C. Sto
rey, graduate, J. B. Holley, '06,
N. K. Carpenter, '07, J. S. Giles,
'04, C. T. Paine, '06, H. Chandler,
'05, G. R. Stevens, 05. Morrison
and Storey come from the Sigma
Nu house, Giles from the Kappa
Alpha house at Palo Alto, Paine
and Holley from Encina Hall, and
Carpenter from the boat-house.
The bacteriological examination in
the cases of Morrison and Storey
hasshovvn a negative result,and con
sequently Storey will be released
in the morning, and Morrison after
a short time.
Dr. Snow said today that he had
examined a large number of throats
at the different clubs, fraternities,
and boarding-houses, but had
found no new cases since Ray was
sent to the hospital Sunday night.
The fact that men are sent to the
hospital on suspicion does not
mean that worse is expected, but
the action is taken merely as a
precaution. Dr. Snow said this
afternoon:
"There is no indication of sec
ondary infection, which is the most
dangerous thing to be feared. The
situation will be uncertain for a
day or so. Only five cases have
developed since we began to take
stringent measures, and that fact
is very encouraging. All the more
serious cases were given anti-toxin,
and are getting along very well.
Some are almost convalescent.
Diphtheria cases may come along
for a week or two. In the first few
days of a jnild case it is very diffi
cult to detect its presence. We
will probably have a few more
scattered cases, but we will learn
of them immediately and we have

ample facilities for handling any
situation that may develop.
" There is only one contingency
that would result in the closing of
the University. If a very large
number of cases should develop we
might not have room and other
facilities to handle them. But
such a condition is not at all ex
pected. With the present arrange
ments we can handle as
many as twenty cases, and there is
no reason to fear more than that.
However, we will be prepared for
any eventuality.
"There will be no general quaran
tine of the University. In hand
ling the present situation I am
acting as an officer of the county,
and any quarantining done will be
by my order. It will not go be
yond a temporary quarantine of the
bouses or rooms from which pa
tients come, until these can be
properly cleansed and fumigated.
The county officers are perfectly
satisfied with the course that is
being taken."
In addition to the cases in the
detention hospital, four cases of
diphtheria are being treated in
private hospitals or houses in Palo
Alto. These patients are Mrs. A.
L. Scott Brook, wife of the organist
of Memorial Church; T. B. Hunter,
'05; G. D. Boalt, graduate student;
and another person whose name is
not known.
The number of tonsilitis patients
in the Guild Hospital at Palo Alto
remains about the same, there
having been no new cases reported.

However, we will be prepared for
any eventuality.
"There will be no general quaran
tine of the University. In hand
ling the present situation I am
acting as an officer of the county,
and any quarantining done will be
by my order. It will not go be
yond a temporary quarantine of the
bouses or rooms from which pa
tients come, until these can be
properly cleansed and fumigated.
The county officers are perfectly
satisfied with the course that is
being taken."
In addition to the cases in the
detention hospital, four cases of
diphtheria are being treated in
private hospitals or houses in Palo
Alto. These patients are Mrs. A.
L. Scott Brook, wife of the organist
of Memorial Church; T. B. Hunter,
'05; G. D. Boalt, graduate student;
and another person whose name is
not known.
The number of tonsilitis patients
in the Guild Hospital at Palo Alto
remains about the same, there
having been no new cases reported.
The small diphtheria epidemic
that has developed at the Univer
sity during the past few days does
not show any alarming growth.
Dr. Snow says that while a few
more eases may develop, he does
not regard the situation as threat
ening. He does not believe that
any necessity of closing the Uni
versity will arise. He denies also
that there will he any general
quarantine of the campus.
There are at the present time nine
cases of diphtheria in the old psy
chology laboratory, which has been
fitted up as a temporary detention
hospital, and six men are being
held there on suspicion that they
have incipient cases of the disease.
Those who are suffering from well
defined cases of the disease are as
follows: W. J. Neidig, instructor
in English; W. A. Manning, in
structor in Mathematics; Stephen
Taber, '0(5, C. S. Sherwood, '07,
H. R. Wilde, '07, H. E. Savage.
'05, J. C. Ray, '07, Miss E. M.
Reeves, '05, Miss O. E. Neal, '05.
Ray was taken to the detention
hospital late Sunday night from
his home on Alvarado row. Miss
Reeves and Miss Neal were taken
from Roble Hall, and Taber, Sher
wood. and Savage from Encina
Hall. Wilde and Instructor Man
ning lived in Palo Alto, and
Instructor Neidig on Alvarado row.
Those who are held as suspects
are H. L. Morrison, '04, J. C. Sto
rey, graduate, J. B. Holley, '06,
N. K. Carpenter, '07, J. S. Giles,
'04, C. T. Paine, '06, H. Chandler,
'05, G. R. Stevens, 05. Morrison
and Storey come from the Sigma
Nu house, Giles from the Kappa
Alpha house at Palo Alto, Paine
and Holley from Encina Hall, and
Carpenter from the boat-house.
The bacteriological examination in
the cases of Morrison and Storey
hasshovvn a negative result,and con
sequently Storey will be released
in the morning, and Morrison after
a short time.
Dr. Snow said today that he had
examined a large number of throats
at the different clubs, fraternities,
and boarding-houses, but had
found no new cases since Ray was
sent to the hospital Sunday night.
The fact that men are sent to the
hospital on suspicion does not
mean that worse is expected, but
the action is taken merely as a
precaution. Dr. Snow said this
afternoon:
"There is no indication of sec
ondary infection, which is the most
dangerous thing to be feared. The
situation will be uncertain for a
day or so. Only five cases have
developed since we began to take
stringent measures, and that fact
is very encouraging. All the more
serious cases were given anti-toxin,
and are getting along very well.
Some are almost convalescent.
Diphtheria cases may come along
for a week or two. In the first few
days of a jnild case it is very diffi
cult to detect its presence. We
will probably have a few more
scattered cases, but we will learn
of them immediately and we have

ample facilities for handling any
situation that may develop.
" There is only one contingency
that would result in the closing of
the University. If a very large
number of cases should develop we
might not have room and other
facilities to handle them. But
such a condition is not at all ex
pected. With the present arrange
ments we can handle as
many as twenty cases, and there is
no reason to fear more than that.
However, we will be prepared for
any eventuality.
"There will be no general quaran
tine of the University. In hand
ling the present situation I am
acting as an officer of the county,
and any quarantining done will be
by my order. It will not go be
