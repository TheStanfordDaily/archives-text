# The
						"Chaparral" Out.
## 
### 
The Chaparral appeared this
morning with an issue that is
hardly up to the usual good stand
ard which the paper as a rule
maintains. With the exception
of a few good drawings by Miss
Clara Lathrop, '06, and an editorial
remark on the honor system, there
is nothing of note in the present
number. There will be one more
issue of the Chaparral before the
close of this semester.
