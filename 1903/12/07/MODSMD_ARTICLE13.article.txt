While there is plenty of reason
for exercising caution in the pres
ent epidemic, no cause for general
alarm on the part of the students
exists. We have reason to be
lieve that the physicians have the
trouble under control, and the per
iod for worry lest the disease spread
lias passed. The greatest good can
be done if every student use his
influence to stop the alarming ru
mors that are constantly being
spread and to allay the disquietude
throughout the University.
