A perfectly plain and feasible
plan for an honor system lias been
drawn up by the Executive Com
mittee and will be voted on Wed
nesday by the Associated Students.
The objection heretofore has been
based on a disdain of reporting,
and since this burden has been
entirely removed from those who
do not interpret their duty to mean
reporting, nothing remains for them
but to endeavor to make the major
ity as big as possible and thus put
the stamp of unanimity on the
system. The system as outlined is
not evasive. It provides that each
man shall use his influence to pre
vent cheating. Influence implies
duty. Duty makes it imperative
that every Stanford man andj
woman exert the utmost influence
to stamp out dishonesty in exami
nations. Those who interpret influ
ence to mean the discouraging of
cheating by social ostracism with
out reporting will be doing their
duty along with those who report.
A person's own conscience must
determine what his duty is. The
issue as it is before the students
now leaves only one alternative.
We must either vote for it unani
mously or decide against it. There
is everything to gain and nothing to
lose by the honor code. Upon so
vital a question as affects the entire
University we cannot afford to

have any division. A two-thirds
vote must he recorded. No need
arises to point out how distressing
a blow will have heen dealt at the
reputation of the University in
case the system is voted down.
The efficacy of the system as it
goes before the University is now
conceded. Even those who first
objected are going to lend their
assistance towards building up the
first great step towards student
control.
