Editor Daily Palo Alto:
After an unavoidable delay the
price of the Senior pins has been
settled with Hammersmith & Field
at $3, and those desiring pins will
do well to order immediately before
the holiday rush. The price is
three dollars and orders are to be
left at the Bookstore. It is hoped
that every member of the class will
procure a pin, for otherwise the pin
will not have its full value as a
class emblem. Editii Edgerly,
A. G. Ckane,
Committee.
