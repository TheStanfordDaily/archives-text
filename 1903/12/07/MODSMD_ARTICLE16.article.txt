Editor Daily Palo Alto:
You have asked me to present
my position on the honor system
as it will be voted on next Wednes
day. Doubtless this request is due
to the fact that 1 was the first to
speak against the system, and it
was found a considerable number
of the student body agreed with
me.
1 opposed the honor system as
it was first proposed for two rea
sons: First. —I did not believe that
there was any demand for it by the
student body, but that there was an
organized effort to work up a senti
ment and get the system adopted.
If that was the ca-e, 1 wanted the
matter thoroughly discussed before
any action was taken. Second.—
The system that was proposed
seemed to me to lie a pledge system
and not an honor system, and 1
did not believe in voting for one
thing and calling it another.
The system as now proposed
does not require any pledge, and
for that reason comes much nearer
being a pure honor system. The
clause added by the Executive Com
mittee in its meeting today takes
away "compulsory" reporting by
leaving it to each man's conscience
whether or not it is his duty to re
port violations of the system. No
one is subject to condemnation for
refusing to report. If a student
sees another cheating he can either
report him to the student commit
tee, or speak to him about it, or act
as he sees fit under the circum
stances; in any case, so long as he
acts honestly, he is living within
the spirit and letter of the honor
system.
The result under this system,
provided we adopt it with a large
majority, will be, either to develop
such a sentiment that each student
will consider it his duty to report
violations, or to develop a keener
sense of honor so the "cold chill"
and social ostracism will follow
cheating without any reporting.
This latter sentiment is the one I
desire to see at Stanford and the
one that represents a pure honor
system. Such a code of honor I
believe can be created without a
"system," but because the one sug
gested may bring it about I am in
favor of it and will do what 1 can
to have it carried by a two-thirds'
majority.
In order that this in all details
may be entirely within the con
trol of the student body, I believe
that the report of the temporary
committee ought to be subject to
ratification by the student body.
