Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The student control of examina
tions as defined by the Executive
Committee in Friday's issue of the
Daily Palo Alto meets with my
heartiest approval. Lest Ihe con
sidered as one of those who oppose
the new measure, I wish to stiite
that every objectionable feature lias
been removed bv the absence of a
personal pledge and the placing,
instead, of the students on their
honor both as individuals and as a
body. I believe that this "evolu
tion" will be successful, and that
our system of honor without an
oath will be one of the greatest fac
tors in future in keeping Stanford
in the forefront of progress.
Hugh A. Moran, '04.
