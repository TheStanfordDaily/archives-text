# ITALIAN BAND CONCERT.
## Excellent Performance by Talented Musicians in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Before an enthusiastic audience,
which came far from filling the
house, the Royal Italian Band gave
its annual concert in Assembly
Hall last Friday evening. The
program rendered was an unusually
fine one and merited a greater
numerical support than was
accorded it. The band as a whole
maintained its high reputation for
unity of action, precision of time,
and quality of tone. The new
leader, Chiaffarelli, is a wonderful
director, and to him is due much
of the harmony and unison which
characterized the performance.
His own compositions, a "Sym
phonic March" and "Mazurka,"
were well received. The best selec
tions by the band were Mozart's
overture "Magic Flute," Verdi's
"La Traviata," and parts of Bizet's
"Carmen." These, as well as every
other piece on the program, were
repeatedly encored. The duets and
solos by Signori Decitno and
Ferullo, Di Natale, Palma, Curti,
and Di Mitris were of unusual
meVit, and called forth hearty
applause.
