# CHANGE IN RESOLUTION.
## Sentence Dealing With Reporting Question Added by Executive Committee. 
### 
At a special meeting of the Exec
utive committee of the Associated
Students this afternoon the honor
system resolution that is to be
voted upon Wednesday was
changed by the addition of a sen
tence dealing explicitly with the
question of reporting. The ques
tion now reads:
"Shall we adopt an honor sys
tem that provides for student con
trol of cheating in examinations?
"Student control means that one
"1. Shall not take or give aid in
examinations, and
"2. Shall use his influence to pre
vent either.
"No pledge will be required of
the individual as to the perform
ance of his duty. Whether or not
it is his duty to report a violation
is left to the conscience of the indi
vidual student.
"Cases of violation shall be in
vestigated by a committee of stu
dents, the number, manner of selec
tion, and other details of which
shall be arranged by a temporary
committee of five students, two to
be selected by the President of the
University, two by the Executive
Committee, and one to be selected
by these four."
The final sentence in the
second paragraph of clause two
was added by the Executive Com
mittee at the request of those stu
dents who wished a definite
statement as to the meaning
implied by the words "influence"
and "duty."
The Executive Committee also de
cided to recommend to the Univer
sity Council that the system be ac
cepted only if it secures a two
thirds' majority of all those voting.
It is considered that a large major
ity will be essential to the future
success of the system if it is
adopted.
