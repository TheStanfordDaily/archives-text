# Plans For Orchestra.
## 
### 
The University Orchestra has
chosen for its leader M. H. Thorpe,
'05, who will fill the vacancy caused
by the resignation of Mr. Scott
Brooke. Mr. Thorpe has selected
new music, and will at once insti
tute a series of practices. The or
chestra will make its first appear
ance under its new leader next
Wednesday, when it will play two
numbers at the University As
sembly.
The concert tour planned for this
semester has been postponed for
various reasons, but it is expected
that the trip will be made soon after
the fall recess. In all probability a
concert will be given at the Univer
sity soon, and an invitation to play
at Menlo Park is under considera
tion.
