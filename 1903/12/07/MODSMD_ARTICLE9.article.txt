# FRESHMAN BASKET-BALL.
## Stanford Loses to California Saturday in a Hard-fought Game. 
### 
Saturday evening the Stanford
Freshman basket-ball team was de
feated by the freshmen from Cali
fornia in Harmon Gymnasium at
Berkeley. The final score was 22-
13. At the end of the first half
the score was 10-6, and the way
in which the Stanford team played
showed plainly that too much re
liance had been placed on individ
ual work. Handicapped by the
waxed floor, to which the Cardinal
players were unaccustomed, the
outcome of the game is not so dis
couraging to the Stanford team as
it appears. The play during the
first half was so one-sided as to be
uninteresting. The California
freshmen scored at will. With a
score of 8 to 0 Stanford improved
and the first half ended 10-6 in
California's favor. During the
entire first half not a single foul
was called.
The play during the second
twenty-minute period was far bet
ler than during the first part of the
game. When the Stanford Fresh
men had accustomed themselves to
the slippery floor, they played with
excellent team work. Stanford
fouled four times and California
three times. Dole converted the
three fouls into three goals, while
the California forward managed to
throw but two out of the four goals.
Presley played a brilliant game for
Stanford. He threw the majority
of the field-goals. Stanford played
but five men, throughout the game.
California substituted one man.
Norman Collyer, '04, accompanied
the Stanford team and acted as
umpire in the game.
No emblems will be awarded the
Stanford men, but the student body
at California will present the Blue
and Gold team with the usual
intercollegiate class emblem.
These basket-ball sweaters may be
worn, however, only in the gymna
sium.
