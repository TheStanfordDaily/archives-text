DO YOU KNOW
That the most wonderful
part of tho world is
California?
Your friends in the East do not, in spite
of the lout? letters you write, describing the
delightful climate and beautiful places.
They wink the eyo, and conclude that you
have learned "to draw the long bow." A
copy of
Sunset Magazine
sent them each month will carry conviction
and redeem your reputation for veracity.
It is THE magazine of California, —is devot
ed to California and things Californian.
Every number is richly illustrated with
line engravings of California views,
and every line in it, from the delicious
love story to the weighty article on scien
tific matters, is typical of California.
