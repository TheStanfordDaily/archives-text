# SITUATION IMPROVING.
## Dr. Snow Believes End of the Diphtheria Epidemic Is in Sight. 
### 
The only development of the
diphtheria situation during the
past twenty-four hours has been
the case of Miss 0. C. Godfrey, '07.
Miss Godfrey was taken to the
detention hospital late yesterday
afternoon from her home on Alva
rado row. She is held on the sus
picion that she may have the dis
ease, the condition of her throat
warranting this action. The num
ber of actual diphtheria cases in
the detention hospital is now nine,
and the number of suspects is the
same. Those who have well de
veloped cases of diphtheria con
tinue to do very well, and some
are approaching convalescence.
Of the nine cases, six were treated
with anti-toxin as a precaution. In
the other cases this was not
deemed necessary. The suspects
are also progressing very well. Dr.
Snow released J. C. Storey, gradu
ate student, this afternon, but H. L.
Morrison, '04, will he retained a
few days longer.
Dr. Snow said this afternoon
that he regarded the- situation as
further improved. The failure of
any cases to develop during the
day, despite the constant search
that is going on, he considered as
good proof of the fact that there are
likely to be very few more. Few
of the cases are of a nature that is
serious, and Dr. Snow believes that
there will be little more trouble in
handling the situation.
The • situation in the Student
Guild Hospital at Palo Alto, where
the tonsilitis cases are being cared
for, remains about the same.
