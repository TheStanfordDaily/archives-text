It is to be regretted perhaps, but
still may be for the best in every
way, that the honor system cannot
be voted on at tomorrow's election
because of the general misunder
standing that is prevelent among
the students in regard to the plan.
The diphtheria epidemic naturally
detracted greatly from the interest
in the new code. In addition
many students have gone to their
homes, and under the existing con
ditions such a light vote would have
been polled 'that it could in no
sense be construed as an accurate
test of the sentiment of the entire
student body. A big vote must be
registered, so that when a decision
is reached every student cg,n feel
that his opinions were recorded. It
is extremely unfortunate that such
a general misunderstanding of the
application and workings of the
system should prevail. When the
matter is again brought before the
students, as it surely will be, such
a degree of intelligence on the sys
tem must be reached that no one
will dare say that he does not un
derstand the question. From now
on it should be the earnest endeav
or of every student to think over
the system and to seriously con
sider every phase of it. It will
always be to our shame if we vote
either for or against the system and
use as an argument that we did so
because we did not understand.
YVith the common sense that uni
versity men and women are sup
posed to be endowed, there is no
reason why the very bottom of the
question should not be reached.
