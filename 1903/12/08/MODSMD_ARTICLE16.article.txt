An opportunity presents itself to
the senior clas√ü to make its emblem
more useful by every member get
ting the pin adopted by the com
mittee. The design is an appro
priate one, and meets with the ap
proval of the class. But unless a
sufficient number of the members

wear it, the emblem can have no
more value besides the mere fact
of its being known as the class pin.
Wearing the pin around the Uni
versity of course cuts very little
figure. What the committee hopes
to bring about by this request of
every member to order a pin is the
resulting good after graduation,
when the class scatters to all parts
of the country. Those who possess
emblems will wear them in hopes
that their possession will bring
about many an occasional meeting
with other members of the class.
These chances will be increased if
more persons own and wear the
pin.
