Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Any one owing money to the
Students' Guild will find me in
room 77, Encina, any evening, or
in room 60 on the quad every
Thursday afternoon from four to
six. Mr. McDowell will also receive
money at the Registrar's office.
Some bills have remained unpaid
since September. It is my desire
to have all bills paid before the end
of the semester.
