# INN ASSESSMENTS.
## Sixty-five Members of the Defunct Club Have Paid the Levy-Demanded. 
### 
A circular letter dated November
25th was Bent out from President
Jordan's ollice to all members of
the bankrupt University Inn Club
requiring that the pro rata assess
ment of $12.95 be paid by Decem
ber Bth. Up to noon today sixty
five members had responded to the
call for funds, making the total
amount paid at the present time
$841.75. This is about one third of
the total indebtedness, which rests
upon one hundred and eighty-six
members.
The assessment applies to those
who have left college as well
as those now registered, and
a number of the graduates have al
ready sent in the money. While
the date for payment was set for
December Bth, no penalty was at
tached to a failure to pay by that
date, and in cases of absolute neces
sity an extension of time will prob
ably be given.
The present management of the
University Inn is apparently meet
ing with success, and it is author
itatively stated that the present
operation will continue during the
spring semester. It is probable
that the Inn will be kept open dur
ing the holiday recess, but this will
depend upon the number of stu
dents remaining on the campus at
that time.
