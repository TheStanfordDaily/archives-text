# REV. CLAMPETT PREACHES.
## San Francisco Divine Occupies Memorial Church Pulpit Sunday Morning. 
### 
The sermon in Memorial Church
Sunday was preached by Rev. F.
W. Clampett, rector of Trinity
Church, San Francisco. He chose
as his text "We persuade men."
The preacher touched upon the
remarkable awakening of personal
interest in the Christian faith
among men of prominence, naming
as types Gladstone, Balfour, the
German emperor, and President
Roosevelt, who did not fail to
declare their allegiance to Christ,
the Son of God. He said in part:
"The persuasive power of truth
is its greatest force. Four reasons
exist which explain this power over
the lives of men: The religion of
the gospel is absolutely reasonable.
God appeals to man's intelligence
and acknowledges the sovereignty
of the human will. His attitude is
defined in the sentiment, 'Come
now and let us reason together.'
Again, its thoroughness is a tre
mendous influence in an appeal to
life. Jn ways such as this, when
the energizing force is pronounced,
the study of the life of Jesus illus
trates fidelity to truth. Men of
any day realize the powerful appeal
in the heroic spirit of the Christian
faith. Nowhere in history will
there he found anything to equal
the self-sacrifice of the Son of God.
The cross stands for the noblest
surrender, the greatest self-abnega
tion. Finally, the infinite love of
God underlying all his divine
relationship strikes the ke3'note of
human life.
