# WITHDRAWN FROM BALLOT.
## Honor System Not to Be Voted upon at Tomorrow's Student Body Election. 
### 
The honor system will not be
voted upon at the student body
election tomorrow. Acting upon a
petition signed by twenty of the
most prominent advocates and op
ponents of the system, the Execu
tive Committee of the Associated
Students, at a special meeting this
afternoon, decided to withdraw the
question from the ballot. This
action was taken because it was
claimed by many that sufficient
time for discussion and considera
tion had not been given, and it was
also said that the diphtheria scare
might have the effect of greatly
reducing the vote. The petition
upon which the Executive Com
mittee acted, with its signers, was
as follows:
"To the Executive Committee:
â€” Believing that a great misunder
standing exists among the students
regarding the honor system, and
that the diphtheria epidemic has
detracted interest from it so much
that, together with the fact that a
number of students have left the
University, a sufficiently large
vote either way will not be polled,
we, the [undersigned students of
Stanford University, respectfully
petition your honorable body to
postpone student body action on
the honor system until either the
last week in January, 1904, or the
first week in February of the same
year, at which time a special elec
tion could be called and in the
meantime opportunity given for
everybody to thoroughly under
stand the system. We think that
it would be a great calamity to
have such a system either adopted
or voted down by a small portion
of the entire student body voting,
and we respectfully ask your com
mittee to postpone the election on
the honor system until the time
mentioned above.
