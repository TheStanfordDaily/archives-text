# TODAY'S ASSEMBLY.
## Talks by Dr. Jordan, Professor Searles, and Captain Young. 
### 
The last Assembly of the semes
ter, held in Assembly Hall this
morning, was attended by a smaller
number of students than usual for
the reasons that many have left
the University on leaves of absence
and a number of others feared the
possibility of further spread of
diphtheria which the large gather
ing may have offered. President
Jordan reviewed the diphtheria
situation and gave assurance that
further danger of contagion need
not be feared, but that the time for
precautionary measures had not
yet passed. He also spoke in
praiseworthy terms of the prompt
and effective work by the Students'
Guild and the Hygiene department.
Prof. Colbert Searles, of the
Department of Romanic Languages,
spoke on that problem in college
athletics which has to deal with
the college men and others who
witness athletic events without giv
ing their financial support. He
referred particularly to the men
who view the games on the oval
from the windows of Encina, and
to fraternity and sorority houses
that subscribe to but one copy of
the college publications, instead of
the individuals each taking out a
separate subscription.
The speaker suggested that while
considering the honor system in
examinations we would do well to
ask ourselves what we are going to
do with the "deadhead" who in
fests the side-lines of our college
contests.
President Jordan then introduced
the principal speaker of the meet
ing, Captain Charles Young, of the
9th United States Cavalry, the only
colored graduate of West Point.
Captain Young spoke in part as
follows:
"1 desire, first of all, to thank
you for the opportunity which has
been given me to stand before you.
I shall try to acquaint you with a
few of the standards and ideals of
new negrodom. At present I can
not but feel that the higher inter
ests of my people are going nether
ward, and that the white people of
the coming era are not an inch be
hind. When one part of the body
is diseased it reacts on the whole.
We are part and parcel of the body
politic of these United States, and
to cure the disease you have offered
amalgamation, deportation, bodily
extermination, and industrialism.
"With all that is claimed for in
dustrialism and with due honor to
Mr. Booker T. Washington, I feel
that what is proposed for the negro
in that direction will not do the
work. When the black man has
learned the industrial trades and
seeks work he runs into the unions,
where he is told that no negroes
need apply. The white employer
would employ him but is afraid.
He knows the negro is entitled to
work but he cannot give it to him.
"We are urged to give up our
claims to higher education. Tus
keegee could not exist without
higher education. Contact with
men of brain, of high ideals, is
essential. Even though our race

has produced great painters and
sculptors, such as Dunbar, we are
urged to give up all these things
in order that we may survive.
What does survival mean? We
know what it is to eat our own
hearts; we know what it is to stifle
our ideals. We also know what it
is to do things right; to have the
finger of scorn pointed our way be
cause we do not come up to the
white man's ideals.
"History tells us of no race that
has given up its best and highest
ideals that has amounted to any
thing. When we are told to give
up our highest ideals, our hearts
tell us not to do it. The example
of white men tells us the same
thing. We are not going to do it.
And this is not the 'sassy nigger'
that says this. It is the revolt of
black American manhood. All we
ask is that the educated men and
women of our universities be kind
and magnanimous toward the
negro. My people have already
been greatly helped by your people.
The people of the South have
greatly aided my people.
"All a negro asks is a white
man's chance. Will you give it?
Will you give the negroes a chance
to build homes for themselves and
a chance to make themselves good
citizens?"
