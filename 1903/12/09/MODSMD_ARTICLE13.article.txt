# ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL.
## Challenge Received for a Game with Oakland Team Cannot Be Accepted. 
### 
The Hornets Association Foot
ball Club of Oakland has issued a
challenge for a game with a Stan
ford team on either New Year's
Day or Washington's Birthday.
Since there is no association foot
ball team at Stanford, the challenge
cannot be accepted. '
Association football has never
met with much favor at Stanford,
although it was introduced several
years ago at the same time as hand
ball and basket-ball. In order to
arouse interest in the game, the
California Association Football
League has offered to send a
coach occasionally, free of charge,
to instruct those men who show
interest in the sport. The gymna
sium authorities will aid in this
plan in that whenever a coach
comes- down at the time of regular
gymnasium hours, those members
of the classes who wish, may take
instruction in football instead of
their regular work. It is hoped
that in this way enough enthusi
asm will be aroused in the sport so
that in the near future it will be
possible to have a representative
Stanford team.
The California Association Foot
ball League intends next spring to
send down to the University two
picked teams, composed of mem
bers of the league, who will play a
regular game on the campus.
