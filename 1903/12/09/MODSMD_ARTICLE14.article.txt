"The Reign of Queen Isyl," by
Gelett Burgess and Will Irwin,
recently published, is rather a new
"Taleof a Thousand Nights," whose
scenes are laid in California. There
is only a thread of plot to bind
together the narratives with which
each of the characters justifies his
introduction; but that thread,
though slight, is sparkling, and
the narratives themselves are for
the most part worthy ones.
The scene is laid in San Jose;
the time is Fiesta week, and the
events of the entire story occupy
but three days. There is a wealth
of local color, a Stanford hero, a
heroine from Los Gatos. All the
scenes and places are familiar, but
the local color is transfigured by
lime light and the scenes are pre
sented in an unusual way. The
glamor of the carnival is over the
book, and it is this glamor, thrown
about the romantic impossibilities
of the plot, that makes the book
deeply interesting.
