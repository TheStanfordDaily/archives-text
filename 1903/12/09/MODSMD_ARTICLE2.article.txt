# NO NEW DIPHTHERIA CASES.
## Dr. Snow Believes the Trouble Has Reached Its Natural End. 
### 
The condition of all the diph
theria patients in the detention
hospital continues to improve day
by day, and Dr. Snow and his as
sociates now look forward confi
dently to the early end of the
trouble. H. L. Morrison, '04,
would be released at once except
that the physicians wish to build
up his general health a little. The
condition of all the other patients
continues to show marked improve
ment, and there will be no delay in
releasing them as soon as the di
sease has run its course and the
danger of possible relapse is past.
It would be difficult to set an ex
act date for the discharge of any
of the men. The men who were
taken to the hospital as suspects
are being treated to prevent any
development of diphtheria, and
when it is certain that all danger
is past in each case, those confined
will be sent away. All of these will
probably be freed within a week.
In the cases of those actually suf
fering from the disease the delay
will be longer,but all will undoubt
edly get away at some time early
in the holidays.
