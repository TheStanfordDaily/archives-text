# MINNESOTA WILL COME.
## To Play University of California in San Francisco on New Year's Day. 
### 
It seems to be a certainty that
the University of Minnesota foot
ball team will play the University
of California in San Francisco on
New Year's Day. The faculty
athletic board of Minnesota has
finally given its approval, and it is
announced at Berkeley that all the
important arrangements have now
been made. The game will take
place on the Richmond grounds,
the scene of the recent intercol
legiate game. Minnesota will
bring out twenty or thirty men,
including most of those who have
helped during the past season to
tie Michigan 6-6, and to defeat
decisively Wisconsin and the lesser
colleges of the Middle West. The
University of California will pay
all the expenses of these men, in
cluding their ten day's residence
in San Francisco. Minnesota is
seeking a guarantee and a per cen
tage of the gate receipts.
At California the game is looked
forward to with eagerness, and hard
training will be begun at once.
Although the men have done no
work on the gridiron since their
meeting with Stanford, they are in
good general condition, and it is
believed that they will be in excel
lent shape when they meet Min
nesota. After a few days of light
work, they will get down to hard
scrimmages. An effort will be made
to bring out Garrett Cochran, the
famous Princeton coach, for two
weeks to give the men the benefit
of his knowledge.
The California team will be com
posed of the men who met Stanford
last month. The line-up will be
about as follows: Center, Stroud:
left guard, Stow; left tackle, How
ard; left end, Demerritt; right
guard, Overall; right tackle, Heit
muller; right end, Hudson ; quarter
back, More; left half, Mini; right
half, Snedigar; full-back, Force.
As substitutes California will have
Kittrelle, Risley, Muther and
Whipple as half-backs; Belnap,
quarter; Oliver, Craig, and Cleary,
ends. For the five center positions
California has only Gray, Read,
Taylor and Howard, as all the rest
of her players in these positions
are too light.
There was some question raised
in regard to the right of California
to employ a professional coach un
der the intercollegiate athletic
agreement with Stanford. Col.
Edwards, chairman of the faculty
athletic committee of California,
wrote to Dr. Angell, chairman of
the Stanford committee, in this re
gard. Dr. Angell answered as fol
lows: "I do not consider it contarv
to the intercollegiate agreement for
you to employ an Eastern coach. I
am glad to know that California is to
play Minnesota, and hope you beat
the Easterners. The good wishes of
all Stanford men are behind you."
Dr. Angell does not consider this
act of California's as breaking the
agreement any more than Stanford's
playing with Michigan special stu
dents and others not eligible to play
against California under the terms
of the intercollegiate agreement.
