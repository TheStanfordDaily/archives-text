# NEW GEOLOGY SOCIETY.
## Organization Which Began at Stanford is Reaching a Perfected State.

A late issue of Science contains
an article devoted to the formation
of a general geological society
among American universities and
schools of mining. Ralph Arnold,
'99, formerly an assistant in the
Stanford Geology department, and
now of the United States Geological
Survey, Washington, 1). C., and
D. C. Wiley, '04, are the joint
writers of the article.
The organization, which is to bo
known as the Geological Society of
American Universities, had its in
ception in the action of the local
geological society three years ago.
At that time the members of the
Stanford Geological Society began
to consider the possibility of form
ing a general geological society
among the students of the various
universities and schools of mines
having efficient departments of
mining and geology. Active mem
bership is to be restricted to stu
dents whose major subject is
mining or geology. Other persons
may be admitted as associate or
honorary members. Since high
scholarship is a necessary requisite
to membership, the organization
will become an honor society simi
lar to Sigma Xi.
The social and fraternal side of
the society is to be especially em
phasized, but this element is not
to be allowed to detract from its
work as a scientific body.
Since the matter has been agitat
ed two universities which formerly
had no local organizations have
formed societies, and these wi(h
other older societies are now cor
responding with the Stanford secre
tary, 1). C. Wiley, '04. The work
of organization will he effected
through correspondence, but after
next year the society expects to
hold annual conventions. As yet
the plan is tentative, but its adop
tion and the formation of such a
society seems to be a certainty of
the near future.
