The New Year's football contest
between California and Minnesota
will be awaited with much interest
by the entire Coast and especially
by Stanford. The game will bring
the Middle West and the West
nearer together for the time being,
and will serve to work for closer
relations between the university
elements of the two sections. Min
nesota's team may be regarded as
holding along with Michigan the
championship of the Middle West.
The players under Coach Williams
make up one of the strongest elev
ens that has ever represented a
state university, and aside from
the benefits that will accrue to both
California and Stanford from the
coming game, the meeting of
the two elevens from differ
ent sections of the country
will give the people out here an op
portunity to form opinions of the
relative merits of Western and
Middle Western football. Cali
fornia will be the distinct gainer,
and Stanford will not gainsay her
this opportunity. The Cardinal
will be benefitted by the lessons that
will come from witnessing such a
contest. Minnesota will be the
guest of the entire Coast, and par
ticularly of California. Stanford
and Minnesota are naturally on
the same plane of feeling as to
rivalry with California, but in the
coming contest our hearts and
sympathies are with California. In
connection with the game Stanford
does not question California's right
to the services of Cochran. Her
actions, as stated by I)r. Angell, are
not in violation of the intercollegi
ate agreement. Neither in spirit
nor letter is California's plan ob
jectionable to Stanford.
