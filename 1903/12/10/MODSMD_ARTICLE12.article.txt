The extended and varied collec
tion of cities embraced in the com
ing tour of the Glee and Mandolin
Clubs offers a field for advanta
geous missionary work that does
not seem to reveal itself to all those
on the organizations. Stanford
has a wide area to draw from in
the states to he visited by the clubs
during the holidays, and to an
extent the reputation of the Uni
versity rests for the time be
ing in who make up
the personnel of the two organiza
tions. Stanford has been very well
represented in the past, and those
who have carried its name have
been particularly loath to do any
thing that would cast reflection,
and of course the clubs this year
will prove no exception. The mu
sicians have it in their power to do
a tremendous amount of good for
their University, not only in mak
ing it desirable that preparatory
school students in the North turn
this way, but in reawakening the
interest of the alumni in those
sections. These annual tours are
invaluable in strengthening Stan
ford spirit in the graduates who
find in these concerts the only
opportunity to reacquaint them
selves with their University. Alum
ni organizations assist greatly in
arousing interest in the concerts,
and these annual visits make their
work easier and more of a pleasure.
The loyalty of the Stanford gradu
ate asserts itself on every occasion,
and the musical clubs are a power
ful medium in aiding the expres
sion of this feeling.
