# The
						Current " Alumnus."
## 
### 
The issue of the Alumnus for this
week reviews the honor system dis
cussion and the threatened diph
theria epidemic. A report of Dr.
Abbott's lecture on Bentham is
given, as is a caustic criticism of
the Royal Italian Band concert.
The critic disapproves of the ren
dering of "rag-time" to an encore
of classical music, and rates the
last concert of lower standard than
previous performances. The edi
torial is on the diphtheria.
