# Arranging Minnesota Game.
## 
### 
The financial arrangements for
the California-Minnesota football
game to be played in San Fran
cisco on New Year's Day have been
agreed upon between the managers
of the two universities. California
will have full charge of the finan
ces of the game, and from the re
ceipts will have to pay the entire
expenses of the visiting team. The
game should net California several
thousand dollars, which can be de
voted advantageously to the con
struction of athletic grounds for fu
ture intercollegiate games on the
Berkeley campus.
