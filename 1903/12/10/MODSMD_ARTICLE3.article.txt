There has been practically no
change in the situation at the de
tention hospital during the past
twenty-four hours. There have
been no new cases of diphtheria,
and the old cases continue to show
normal improvement. The num
ber of suspects kept at the hospital
remains the same, none having
been discharged since the release of
J. C. Storey two days ago. These
suspects are carefully examined by
Dr. Snow daily, and when it is
found that every sign of the disease
has disappeared from their throats,
they will be released. At the pres
ent time it is impossible to set any
definite date, but it will not be
more than a few days.
