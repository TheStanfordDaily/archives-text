# CANDIDATES FOR TRACK.
## Captain's Call Brings Out Many New Men to Fill Vacancies. 
### 
Since the recent handicap field
meet and the return of Track Cap
tain Holman, the track prospects
for next spring have assumed defi
nite form.
Two good men in the sprints
form the nucleus for point winners
in the events in which the team
was not very strong last year.
Ah in the last two intercollegiate
meets, the 440 yard dash will be
well represented. One point win
ner in this event has been lost by
graduation, but the handicap meet
brought out some men who will fill
the vacancy.
Thomson, '04, who displayed
such fine form last spring in the
half-mile run, will not be in college
next semester. The loss of such a
sure first-place man is almost irre
parable. Several good men are out
for this event, but as yet none of
them have shown any great speed.
Trainer Moulton is especially dis
appointed over the loss of Thom
son, because he confidently ex
pected the half-miler to break the
Coast record for his event next
spring.
A large number of capable per
formers will appear for the other
distance events. Eraser, '05, from
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and Smith, a graduate
student from Wisconsin, are both
good men in the two-mile run, but
the one-year residence rule bars
them from the meet next spring.
The pole-vault presents less diffi
culty than any other event. Dole,
'04, Beach, "04, and Hell, '05, are
certain to win points for Stanford
in this. The recent good showing
of Dole in the handicap meet led
Trainer Moulton to predict that he
will break the world's pole-vaulting
record before the track season is
finished.
The broad and high jumps do
not lose any good men this year,
and these events will be strength
ened by the addition of several
freshmen with good preparatory
school records.
W. E. Crawford, '05, has ac
cepted a position as student assist
ant in the Chemistry department,
and this renders him ineligible to
compete in the intercollegiate field
meet. Crawford won first place in
the hammer-throw last year, and
showed that he had not yet reached
his limit. Several old weight men
will strive for his place, but none
of them have approached anywhere
near his record. Several freshmen
are trying the weights, but none of
them have shown varsity form.
The hurdles are causing the
track management the greatest
anxiety. Kuhn, '04, will finish
Christmas, and Weller, '06, has de
cided not to run the high hurdles.
Weller's injured leg may prevent
him from running the low hurdles.
Cruzan, '06, gives promise of mak
ing a fair hurdler, and several fresh
men are out. for these events.
Moulton and Holman are watching
the work of these men very closely,
and they expect to.develop at least
two good hurdlers from the candi
dates.

The recent work on the track
and runways has put them in bet
ter shape than they have ever been
before at this time of the year.
Training can be continued practi
cally all winter. Spring training
will commence immediately after
the opening of next semester.
Both captains and trainer consider
this early start necessary to de
velop good men from the large
number of freshmen who appear on
the Stanford track for the first
time. A larger number of field
days than usual will be held next
spring. If a sufficient number of
matches cannot be arranged with
other teams, more handicap and
interclass meets will be scheduled.
