# LECTURE ON LIVINGSTONE.
## Dr. Abbott of Law Department Gives Second Address of Series. 
### 
Dr. Abbott last night delivered
the second of his series of lectures
on noted lawyers. The subject of
his talk was Edward Livingstone.
He began by drawing a comparison
between Livingstone and Bentham,
and showed that while Bentham
was a recluse, Livingstone was a
man of the world, with a highly
developed social nature.
The speaker showed how Living
stone had tried to create a great
landed state in America, much
upon the idea of the old English
estates, but his theories conflicted
with the democratic American
principles, and his vast property
was ultimately divided. In addi
tion it was shown how Livingstone
was associated in his early life
with such men as Burr, Hamilton,
Keith, and Hoffman, who were all
comparatively poor when starting
out in life. Livingstone had
money and was one of the excep
tions to the rule that poverty leads
to success at the bar.
The early political life of Living
stone was narrated, showing what
financial misfortunes befell him
while he was district attorney of
New York. As a result of these ex
periences he removed to New
Orleans and began his practice in
hope of regaining a fortune. His
efforts met with great success and
it was here that he drafted his
famous criminal code, the first
draft of which was burned soon
after completion, the second copy
being completed three years later,
in 1826. "This code," said Dr.
Abbott,"is a standard of excellence
and has been received in England,
Germany, Russia, and in fact over
most of the civilized world."
In conclusion, the speaker
showed what remarkable results
Livingstone had accomplished, in
spite of early financial difficulties,
the tragic death of his wife,
daughter, and sons, and the an
tagonism of many of the most
prominent men of his day. Dr.
Abbott related how the great
lawyer had spent his latter years
in the service of his country, in
congress, as secretary of state, and
finally as minister to France, and
upon his death passed the "first
legal genius of modern times."
