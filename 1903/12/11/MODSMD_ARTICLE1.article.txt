# WILL EDIT "CHAPARRAL."
## Dr. Jordan and Professors to Issue Special Number Next Semester. 
### 
President Jordan will be editor
in-chief of the second number of
the Chaparral to be issued next
semester, and he will be assisted
by a staff composed of many of
the older members of the faculty.
Complete control of the number
will be handed over to Dr. Jordan
and his associates by I. Russell, '04,
the student editor, and the con
tents of the issue will be entirely of
faculty production. Dr. Jordan
himself will have charge of the
editorial "Now that" column, and
will also give a helping hand with
the jokes and friendly "knocks."
Those who have already accepted
positions as associate editors are
Registrar Elliott, Professor A. \V.
Smith of the Department of
Mechanical Engineering, and Pro
fessor Newcomer of the English de
partment.
