Announcement that there is a
possibility of interclass tennis
tournaments will be received by
everybody as an indication that
extra effort is to be made this year
to bring this branch of athletics up
to the standard it deserves. It is
much to our discre Jit that in the
past facilities for preparing a Var
sity team have been so unsatisfac
tory, and that victories were not
taken by the Stanford representa
tives was due more than anything
else to the bad condition of the
courts. With the completion of
the new court and the promise of
two additional ones, appearances
begin to look assuring, and the
handicap in this direction seems
removed, with the formation of a
Tennis Club, which isexerting every
effort to raise the standard of the
sport and to arouse the interest of
every player in the University,
hardly any reason exists why
next season should not go
on record as a successful one. In
auguration of class tournaments
will do much to enlarge the Held of
tennis aspirants by providing some
measure of distinction for those
who are not successful in qualifying
for the intercollegiate team. The
wider the field of any athletic sport
is made the greater will be the
standard of the first team. Class
contests promise added interest in
the sport as a whole by increasing
the incentive to participation. Col
lege athletics will be benefitted by
opening to more students the op
portunity to enter a branch that a
large majority find most acceptable
to them. Results of the innovation
of class contests will reveal them
selves in the prospects for an inter
collegiate victory, which seem to
be closer this year than for some
time.
