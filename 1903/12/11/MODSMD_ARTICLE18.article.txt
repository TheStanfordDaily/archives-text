## President Jordan Writes Article on Public Versus Denominational Institutions. 
### 
President Jordan has an article
in a symposium on "The Public
Schools and the Colleges" in the
Outlook for November 14th. The
question whether any difference is
noticeable in the character of stu
dents from public schools and those
from denominational and private
institutions was answered almost
unanimously in the negative by
presidents of nineteen American
colleges. The letter of Dr. Jordan
follows:
"We do not find in general that
the moral character of students
coming from church or denomina
tional schools is superior to that of
those coming from the public
schools. On the average, the char
acter of graduates from the public
schools is rather higher, but that
is in part or wholly due to the fact
that idle sons of wealthy parents
are often sent to church schools be
cause of their supposed greater ri
gidity of discipline. It is true that
students that go to church schools
learn some things which the partic
ular church may value or even re
gard as vitally essential, but which
other churches hold in less esteem.
"As a matter of fact, with all
their defects and limitations, our
public schools, from the primary
school to the state university,
are sending out a body of students
self-reliant, clever young people,
who have in the main the essentials
of sound life. The fact that they
are self-reliant and do their own
thinking is one reason for the at
tacks made on the schools. We do
not often find a church school
whose product is intellectually or
morally above the average of pub
lic schools of the same grade.
"Ethical training and religious
instruction should have a place in
all schools, but in so far as they are
effective they should be divorced
from denominational control. We
study politics in the universities,
but not under direction of partisan
leaders or campaign orators, nor
yet under direction of the partisan
central committees. The same
principle holds good in the schools.
A school which exists for the sake
of education will turn out better
men and women than one which
exists as a part of any religious or
political movement and for the
purpose of promoting its special
ends."
