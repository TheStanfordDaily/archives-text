# TENNIS CLUB MEETS.
## Important Matters Considered Last Night.â€” Class Tournaments May Be Held. 
### 
Many things of importance were
considered at last night's meeting
of the Tennis (Jlnb. The commit
tee on subscriptions read its report,
which was to have been presented
to the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students at its regular
meeting Wednesday. On account
of the short notice given, the com
mittee could not get its statements
together,and its report will be read
to the Executive Committee next
Wednesday. The chairman of the
subscriptions committee stated that
about $175 of the amount sub
scribed was either collected or would
be forthcoming in a few days.
After the report of the subscrip
tions is presented to the Executive
Committee Wednesday, action on
the project of building two new
courts will be taken at once. In
case work is commenced during
the holidays some member of the
Tennis Club will superintend the
construction.
As the courts are almost a surety,
the club has commenced to con
sider plans for next semester.
With additional courts it will be
possible to hold interclass as well
as the regular try-out tournaments.
These interciass tournaments will
be an innovation at Stanford, and
they will serve to bring out new
men who now hesitate to play
against the Varsity men in the
try-outs for the intercollegiate
match.
The proposition of giving some
sort of an emblem to the men who
make the Varsity tennis team was
discussed. As matters now stand
the man who wins a match in the
intercollegiate contest gets a big
! 'S," but the one who makes the
team and does not win gets noth
ing. The club was unanimous in
its desire that some emblem be
given the Varsity tennis men
whether they win or lose. Presi
dent Roseberry appointed the fol
lowing committee to confer with
the Athletic Committee in regard
to the matter: A. W. Hooper, '05,
A. Ames, 'Oft, and G. A. Hodge, '06.
The tournament held to select
the eight men entitled to the use
of the new court is ended. All of
the men who either failed to play
or lost their preliminary matches
have defaulted. The following
men, who reached either the finals
or the semi-finals, are entitled to
use the court: F. A. Leib, '02, R.
C. Leib, '04, H. H. Hall, '04, J.
Mori, '04, L. H. Roseberry, '03,
A. W. Hooper, '05, G. McLaine,'o7,
