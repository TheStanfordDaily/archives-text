# GUILD BOARD MEETS.
## Important Business Is Transacted. Privileges of Hospital Will Be Given to Faculty. 
### 
The Guild board met in regular
session Friday night and agreed on
two matters of general interest.
The board decided that the regular
rates should apply to the diphthe
ria patients now being cared for,
and that the extra expense incurred
should *be borne by the associa
tion.
It is the policy of the Guild, in
view of the fact that there are no
facilities for handling contagious
cases, not to accept any. But the
emergency at this time was such
that it was necessary to take those
who were sick, although it called
for a great deal of added expense.
But this expense, which was due to
fitting up an isolated hospital, was
incurred more for the protection of
the student body at large than on
account of the patients themselves.
For this reason the sentiment of
the Guild seemed to be that the
extra expense should not be
charged to the patients. This
opinion is held by many students
as well.
Aside from the heavy expense of
equipment, it would have cost for
nurses and services at least three
or four dollars a day for the
patients confined. The rate at
the detention hospital will be ac
cordingly the same as at the regu
lar hospital, which is one dollar
per day. This ruling is made in
justice to the students who are de
tained. It is the custom of hospi
tals generally, however, to charge a
largely incre >sed rate for cases of
contagious diseases.
The second important action of
the board was to extend the privi
leges of the Guild for the next
semester to members of the faculty,
upon payment of a fee, which will
be determined upon later. In
addition a rate of $1.50 per day
will be assessed those using the
hospital. Heretofore the faculty
have not been allowed the same
rights as the students, as the Guild
was considered a student organiza
tion. The faculty members have
had to pay the advanced rate
charged for emergency cases. A
special membership fee will be
levied upon the faculty at the
beginning of next semester, and
those who fail to pay will still be
subject to the emergency rates.
