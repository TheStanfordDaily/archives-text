# CHRISTMAS HIS THEME.
## Chaplain Gardner Preaches in Memorial Church Both Morning and Afternoon. 
### 
Chaplain Gardner preached yes
terday at eleven o'clock and took
as his theme, "The Spirit of Christ
inas." The sermon was an inter
pretation of "the strange joy which
year hy year stirs the heart of
Christendom, and makes the world
a brighter and happier place, in
the presence of the new philanthro
py, the new charity, which marks
the Christmas season." The preach
er regarded this seasonable joy as
a part of our Christian heritage,
and one of the gifts of the Christian
centuries.
He asserted that the spirit of
Christmas is not the survival of
any myth or legend, but rather the
flower and fruitage of a great his
l toric fact, and the fact in history is
this â€”that on the first Christmas
Day Jesus Christ was born. And
in the message "Glory to God in
the highest, and on earth peace,
good-will towards men," the preach
er found the secret of the Christ
mas spirit; for peace on earth, good
will to men, was born in Christ, the
Prince of Peace.
Dealing with the operation of the
spirit as a sentiment, an aspiration
and a force, the sermon dealt with
Christmas as the festival of the
church, the festival of the home,
in the consecration of motherhood
and infancy, and lastly as the festi
val of brotherhood.
The chaplain concluded with an
earnest appeal for its proper observ
ance, and h}' wishing the students
a happy and a merry Christmas.
The address in the afternooji was
on the eighth commandment,
"Thou shalt not steal."
