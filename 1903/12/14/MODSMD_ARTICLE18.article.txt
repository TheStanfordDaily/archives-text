Last year the Combined Musical
Clubs completed a trip through the
Northern States that was a success
in many ways. The financial wel
fare of the undertaking was due, in
no small measure, to the fact that
Stanford men had written letters
to their personal friends in the
towns included in the itinerary of
the trip and had aroused thpir in
terest in advance of the arrival of
the club. The same tour will be
repeated this year. The impor
tance of these trips, if they are
successfully managed, in arousing
interest in the Universtiy, is well
recognized, and anything that a
member of the student body can do
to arouse interest in the clubs on
the part of the Northerners will
not only be an act of courtesy
toward the organizations but will
be a definite act directed toward
the development of the University.
There are a number of ways in
which the student body can aid in
making the project a success, but
in no way can such good service be
rendered as by arousing the per
sonal interest of individual friends.
