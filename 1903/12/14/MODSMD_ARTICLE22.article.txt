# "Californian" on Game.

### 
Final arrangements have been
completed for the game between the
Universities of California and Min
nesota in San Francisco New Year's
Day. There seems to be consider
able disappointment at Berkeley
over the outlook. The Daily Cal
if ornian, voicing the sentiment,
says:
"No matter what may be heard
to the contrary, the team that Cal
ifornia will send up against Minne
sota will not he the equal of the
eleven that faced Stanford on No
vember 14th. The line-up will
probably be the same as in the
second half, but the physical con
dition of the men will be far differ
ent. The Varsity has now been
out of training for one month and
will not start in again until after
the 'exes.' That leaves but a
week or ten days in which to re
gain wind and lose avoirdupois.
The men may be in fairly good
shape, but nowhere near the al
most perfect condition they were
in on the 14th.
"Nevertheless, and in spite of all
that has been said, the game with
out doubt will be well worth seeing.
It will give a direct line for com
parison between Eastern and West
ern football. Minnesota is known
to have a strong team, but Califor
nia will not have any bucks harder
to stop than Weller's, and Overall
will ti _be there with his trusty
kicker."
The Californians will not under
take any training until next Fri
day at the earliest, and that will
afford them hardly two weeks of
work. The plan to secure Garrett
Cochran, the Princeton coach, for
two weeks has been abandoned,
and James Whipple will probably
give the men such coaching as they
will receive.
