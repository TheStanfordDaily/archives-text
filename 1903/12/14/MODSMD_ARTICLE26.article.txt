### 
. The condition of Charles S. Dole,
'99, who was thrown from his horse
in Honolulu some weeks ago, still
remainsjserious, according to a pub
lished cablegram, and the former
athlete will he unable to he a mem
ber of the polo team which was to
make a trip to California. As a
consequence, the trip of the polo
players will probably be aban
doned, as there is no one able to
fill Dole's place.
