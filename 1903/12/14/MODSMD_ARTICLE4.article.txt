was a brilliant affair and was at

The scheme followed out in the
decorations was decidedly unique.
The walls were covered with greens

covered with a canopy of red ber

beautifully decorated with palms,
and from the ceiling silver stars
were hung. Couches, pillows, and
rugs were used here and in the ves
