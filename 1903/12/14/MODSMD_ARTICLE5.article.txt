# Chess Club Selected.
## 
### 
The members of the Stanford
Chess Club for the ensuing year
have been chosen. The organiza
tion will consist of fourteen men.
Of these F. A. Leib, J. H. Page,
A. T. Parsons, 11. A. Fuller, F. E.
Ulrich, and H. W. Strong have
played on former teams against
California, and N. E. Dole and
R. C. Leib have been alternates.
A. B. Rhuart is an old California
player. The intercollegiate games
with California will probably be
played about the first of April.
The team will consist of seven men
and one alternate, chosen from the
club. As the competition for
places on this team will close about
the last of March, it is necessary
that the preliminary games be
played off as soon as possible.

follow: E. W. Doane, graduate
student, F. A. Leib, '02, J. H. Page,
'03, A. T. Parsons, '04, N. E. Dole,
