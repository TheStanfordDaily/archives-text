Work on the mosaics in Memo
rial Church is progressing favor
ably. Six new designs, one of
which has been finished, have
arrived from Venice, and are being
put up in the west side of the nave.
The scene of the completed mosaic
is taken from the book of Joshua
5:13-14, and shows Joshua before
the gates of Jericho, conversing
with the "Man of God," who stands
with drawn sword.
The design now being worked
on is based on Exodus 3:9-10, and
is entitled "Moses at the Burning
Bush." Moses is shown kneeling
before God, who appears in the fire
of the bush.
It has not yet been determined
in what order the remaining four
mosaics will be put up. In one,
taken from Genesis 24:64-65, Re
becca is mounted on a camel, while
Isaac conies up to claim her. The
scene is entitled "Isaac Claims
Rebecca." Another represents Ja
cob in the act of kissing Rebecca,
and is based on Genesis 24:10-12.
The remaining two mosaics are
taken from Deuteronomy 34:4 and
Psalm 43:3-4. The first shows
Moses on a mountain-top, with
God standing just behind him
pointing out the promised land. In
the second, David is portrayed in a
tabernacle, surrounded by angels,
and playing on bis harp.
