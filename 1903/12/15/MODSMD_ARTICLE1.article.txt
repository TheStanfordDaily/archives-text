# MARKING SYSTEM CHANGED.
## Report Cards Will Hereafter Designate Character of work Done. 
### 
Report cards for the present se
mester will hear several alterations
which have heen made in the sys
tem of marking that has heen in
vogue in the past. Condition and
failure marks will remain the same,
but instead of a blue mark indi
cating that the student has passed
in a course of study, the character
of his work will be indicated by
letters. A, B, C, and D will corres
pond in a general way to the terms
"excellent," "good," "fair," and
"barely passed." This rule of
grading by letters is not absolute,
and instructors will still be given
the alternative of using the blue
mark.
"Inc.," which has formerly stood
for work that has not been com
pleted, will in the future be desig
nated by the letter i. The charac
ter of the work as far as completed
will be indicated by one of the pass
ing marks followed by the new
mark for "incomplete."
Passing marks in courses which
extend over the entire year will be
shown by one of the passing grades,
followed by a mark which will be
selected to take the place of "def.,"
which in the past has stood for
a passing grade in deferred courses.
The following circular of expla
nation has been sent from the Reg
istrar's oflice to all members of the
faculty:
"Attention is called to the fol
lowing points in connection with
the revision of grade marks as
noted on the 'new semester report
blanks:
"1. The addition of the passing
grades A, B, C, 1), as an alternative
to the plus mark (-(-) heretofore
exclusively used. It will facilitate
the general work of the Registrar's
office and of the Committee on
Scholarship if these grade letters
are used as largely as possible.
"2. The use of the letter i, alone
and in combination with grade
letters, as an alternative for the
old "inc." ,
"3. The discontinuance of the
mark "def." (deferred)."
