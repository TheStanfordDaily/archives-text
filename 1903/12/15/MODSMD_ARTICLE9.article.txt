### 
The Pacific Athletic Association
has decided to hold a state basket
ball tournament, and will offer a
trophy to the winner, who will be
declared the champions of the state.
It is expected that there will he
about a dozen teams in the compe
tition, including Stanford, the Uni
versity of California, Occidental

the Young Men's Christian Associ
ations of San Francisco and Oak
land, besides a number of high
schools. Thus far Stanford has re

tournament.
Stanford will belong to the same
basket-ball league this year as last
year. The league will be composed
of the following teams: the Univer
sity of Calitornia, the Young Men's
Christian Associations of Oakland
and San Francisco, and possibly a
team from the Mission Branch of
the San Francisco Young Men's
Association, and from San Jose.
In all probability the League
games will begin the second week
in February. Each team will play
every other team two games, and
the winner of the League will play
the champions of the Southern
league for the championship.
This championship team will repre
sent the Coast at St. Louis next
summer at the basket-ball tourna
ment. Willamette University, of
Salem, Oregon, will send a team
down sometime next semester to
play each of the teams in the
League. The teams as a league
will pay the expenses of the North
ern team. The previous under
standing was that the individual
teams were to pay the expenses.
At the beginning of next semester
work in basket-ball at Stanford
will receive careful consideration
from the gymnasium authorities,
and every effort will be put forth
to produce a winning team.
