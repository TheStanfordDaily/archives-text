# CHOICE OF COACH DELAYED.
## Director of Football Squad Will Not Be Selected Until Next Semester. 
### 
Although Captain Clark and
Treasurer Cowden have discussed
the choice of a football coach for
next season, no definite arrange
ments have yet been made. In all
probability no one will lie chosen
until next semester, although strong
efforts will he made to complete
the final arrangements early in the
term.
The intercollegiate agreement
with California in regard to gradu
ate coaching will he in force until
the end of 1904. It is practically
certain that every effort will be
made to secure Lanagan as coach
next year. Whether or not he will
again lead the football squad is
very uncertain. He

was severely handi
capped in his work
at Belmont by the
time he devoted to
his coaching at
Stanford, and it is
possible that he will
be unable to lead
the Stanford play
ers next season.
Owing to the fact
that a graduate
head coach must
be secured, should
Lanagan refuse to
come Stanford will
find herself in a
predicament simi
lar to the one which
confronted her two
years ago. The
alumni of the Uni
versity are so wide
ly scattered and so
busily engaged in
other occupations
that there are but
few of the old foot
ball stars who are
available for the
position. It is a
noteworthy fact
that since the in
ception of graduate
coaching Stanford
has won no games
w i th C a 1 i for n i a .Th e

tie game of this year was the best
showing the Cardinal has made
since Yost went to Michigan. The
excellent work that Lanagan
did on the football field this season
makes it practically a certainty
that with him back next season
would result in a Stanford victory.
