# Applications for Rooms.
## 
### 
Fourteen applications have been
received by Mrs. Blynn, the ma
tron of Roble Hall, for rooms next
semester. All of tbpse cannot be
filled, since the number of students
to leave the hall this semester is
less than the number of applica
tions. One hundred and five
women are in the hall at the pres
ent time.
