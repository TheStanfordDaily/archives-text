Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Owing to a misunderstanding in.
regard to the faculty membership
in the Guild us stated in last
night's Daily Palo Alto the
Guild hoard wishes it understood
that the privileges of the Guild are :
open to faculty members provided '
they register during the first month,
as the students now do, and that
they come under the general rate
of a dollar and a half a day. All
cases of faculty members who have
not registered and paid the semes
ter's fee will he charged as emer
gency cases. 11. P. Kuhn.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Will you permit me to speak
throug your columns to the women
of the University? I refer to the
question of the payment of stu
dent body dues. The treas
urer's books show that of the
780 assessments paid during the
present semester but lOOwerecred
dited to women students. When a
man like President Jordan finds it
necessary to reprove us publicly, as
he did at the first Assembly this
year, for disloyalty to our Univer
sity, we can only acknowledge the
fault and set about to remedy it.
Why do the women students not
pay this assessment? Chiefly for
the same reason that one third of
the men neglect it —they do not
understand the situation. A few
facts gathered from the constitution
may make the matter clearer:
In March, 1894, the students of
Stanford University established a
constitution "to provide an organ
ization for the settlement of all
matters of student concern." Arti
cle I, section 2, states that "All
students of Leland Stanford Junior
University are members of this or
ganization." This association is
given control over student organi
zations bearing the University
name. Funds are derived from
special assessments; from receipts
of games, entertainments, and
benefits held under the auspices of
this association; and from "dues,
which shall be one dollar per year."
It will be seen that every student
of Stanford is a member of this
organization, and by virtue of this
membership is responsible for the
annual payment of one dollar dues.
It will be seen further that the
question is not whether we can
spare enough from our pin money
to pay the student body assess
ment, but whether we shall meet
our financial obligations. Let the
women of Stanford once see that
this is not a question of economy,
but of business integrity, and the
result will be very different.
Aside from the question of ob
ligation, personal interest and col
lege loyalty urge the payment of
these dues. Women in the West
are debarred by convention from
participation in athletic events;
but it is within the power of every
woman as well as of every man at
Stanford to assist in the develop
ment of a perfect team to compete
with California in the big game.
The funds received from the pay
ment of dues in September are left
temporarily in the hands of the
treasurer, to meet current expenses
before receipts from games come in.
It. will readily be seen that if these
fees are not paid the coaches will
be severely hampered in the devel
opment of a football team; and
that every dollar paid into the
treasury at the beginning of the
year adds to the probability of a

perfectly conditioned team in the
intercollegiate game.
If from an athletic point of view
the need of this fund has been im
perative heretofore, it is doubly so
now that new athletic grounds
must be ready for the intercollegi
ate game in 1905. Since the new
gymnasium is to furnish all the
conveniences of a training-house,
it is probable that the training
house fund will be used for the
improvement of these grounds, and
that every dollar of dues paid into
the treasury this year will help to
make our first football "at home"
a success.
There is a still more personal
basis of interest in this matter.
The question of coeducation is be
ing agitated anew in this twentieth
century. I have asked a dozen
Stanford men for the basis of op
position. Various reasons were
assigned, but all agreed on one —
women were lacking in college
spirit. And in proof of this came
the invariable statement that they

do not pay the student body assess-
I mem. With the figures before inn I
ir'ould not refute this charge. One
woman out of five has paid. By
1 virtue of our registration at Stan
ford we have become member- of
the Associated Students; as mem-
I in-rs we are bound to give our
I moral and financial support to its
j enterprises. Shall we prove our
selves irresponsible? Shall we
j shift the burden of all student body
activities to the shoulders of the
■ niHii students?
A new registration day will soon
|be here and the opportunity will
l»e given us to prove our college
loyalty. A dollar is a small thing,
l>ut the principle at stake is as big
as the universe. It i* a demand
for a practical application of the
honor system. Let us not fail to
meet it. May it not be said before
the end of the year that not merely
one woman out of five but five
hundred women have paid the
htudent body assessment?
One of the Five Hundred.

of the University? I refer to the
question of the payment of stu
dent body dues. The treas
urer's books show that of the
780 assessments paid during the
present semester but lOOwerecred
dited to women students. When a
man like President Jordan finds it
necessary to reprove us publicly, as
he did at the first Assembly this
year, for disloyalty to our Univer
sity, we can only acknowledge the
fault and set about to remedy it.
Why do the women students not
pay this assessment? Chiefly for
the same reason that one third of
the men neglect it —they do not
understand the situation. A few
facts gathered from the constitution
may make the matter clearer:
In March, 1894, the students of
Stanford University established a
constitution "to provide an organ
ization for the settlement of all
matters of student concern." Arti
cle I, section 2, states that "All
students of Leland Stanford Junior
University are members of this or
ganization." This association is
given control over student organi
zations bearing the University
name. Funds are derived from
special assessments; from receipts
of games, entertainments, and
benefits held under the auspices of
this association; and from "dues,
which shall be one dollar per year."
It will be seen that every student
of Stanford is a member of this
organization, and by virtue of this
membership is responsible for the
annual payment of one dollar dues.
It will be seen further that the
question is not whether we can
spare enough from our pin money
to pay the student body assess
ment, but whether we shall meet
our financial obligations. Let the
women of Stanford once see that
this is not a question of economy,
but of business integrity, and the
result will be very different.
Aside from the question of ob
ligation, personal interest and col
lege loyalty urge the payment of
these dues. Women in the West
are debarred by convention from
participation in athletic events;
but it is within the power of every
woman as well as of every man at
Stanford to assist in the develop
ment of a perfect team to compete
with California in the big game.
The funds received from the pay
ment of dues in September are left
temporarily in the hands of the
treasurer, to meet current expenses
before receipts from games come in.
It. will readily be seen that if these
fees are not paid the coaches will
be severely hampered in the devel
opment of a football team; and
that every dollar paid into the
treasury at the beginning of the
year adds to the probability of a

perfectly conditioned team in the
intercollegiate game.
If from an athletic point of view
the need of this fund has been im
perative heretofore, it is doubly so
now that new athletic grounds
must be ready for the intercollegi
ate game in 1905. Since the new
gymnasium is to furnish all the
conveniences of a training-house,
it is probable that the training
house fund will be used for the
improvement of these grounds, and
that every dollar of dues paid into
the treasury this year will help to
make our first football "at home"
a success.
There is a still more personal
basis of interest in this matter.
The question of coeducation is be
ing agitated anew in this twentieth
century. I have asked a dozen
Stanford men for the basis of op
position. Various reasons were
assigned, but all agreed on one —
women were lacking in college
spirit. And in proof of this came
the invariable statement that they

do not pay the student body assess-
I mem. With the figures before inn I
ir'ould not refute this charge. One
woman out of five has paid. By
1 virtue of our registration at Stan
ford we have become member- of
the Associated Students; as mem-
I in-rs we are bound to give our
I moral and financial support to its
j enterprises. Shall we prove our
selves irresponsible? Shall we
j shift the burden of all student body
activities to the shoulders of the
■ niHii students?
A new registration day will soon
|be here and the opportunity will
l»e given us to prove our college
loyalty. A dollar is a small thing,
l>ut the principle at stake is as big
as the universe. It i* a demand
for a practical application of the
honor system. Let us not fail to
meet it. May it not be said before
the end of the year that not merely
one woman out of five but five
hundred women have paid the
htudent body assessment?
One of the Five Hundred.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Owing to a misunderstanding in.
regard to the faculty membership
in the Guild us stated in last
night's Daily Palo Alto the
Guild hoard wishes it understood
that the privileges of the Guild are :
open to faculty members provided '
they register during the first month,
as the students now do, and that
they come under the general rate
of a dollar and a half a day. All
cases of faculty members who have
not registered and paid the semes
ter's fee will he charged as emer
gency cases. 11. P. Kuhn.
