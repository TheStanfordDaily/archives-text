# ALL-AMERICAN TEAMS.
## Walter Camp Selects Three Elevens From Football Stars of the Season. 
### 
Walter Camp, Yale's famous
coach, presents in the current num
ber of Collier's Weekly an all-Amer
ican football team for 1903. He
lias picked out the star players of
each position and assigned them to
a first eleven, and in addition he
has selected the two next best men
in each place and assigned them
to second and third elevens. His
line-ups are as follows: '
First Eleven. —Ends, Henry of
Princeton, Ilafferty of Yale; tack
les, Hogan of Yale, Knowlton of

i Harvard; guards, DeWitt of Prince
ton, A. Marshall of Harvard; cen
ter, Hooper of Dartmouth; quarter,
Johnson of Carlisle; halves, Heston
of Michigan, Kafer of Princeton;
full, Smith of Columbia.
Second Eleven.—Ends, Davis of
Princeton, Shevlin of Yale; tackles,
Thorpe of Columbia, Schacht of
j Minnesota, guards, Riley of West
Point, Oilman of Dartmouth; cen
ter, Strathern of Minnesota; quar
ter, Whitham of Dartmouth;
halves, Nichols of Harvard, Mit
chell of Yale; full, R. Miller of
Princeton.
Third Eleven. —Ends, Redden of
Michigan, Rogers of Minnesota;
tackles, Turner of Dartmouth,
Maddock of Michigan; guards,
Berthke of Wisconsin, Piekarski of
Pennsylvania; center, Hruce of
I Columbia; quarter, Harris of Min-

nesota; halves, Graver of Michigan,
Stankard of Holy Cross; full, .Sal
mon of Notre Dame.
The line-up of the first eleven
gives three positions to Princeton,
two to Yale, two to Harvard, and
one each to Dartmouth, Carlisle,
Michigan, and Columbia. DeWitt
and Hogan are recognized as the
stars of the year, and Heston of
Michigan is also prominently men
tioned.
Writing of the champions of the
season, Camp says:
"Of all the teams, Princeton was
the most consistent in performance,
and it was that steady consistency
that gave her eleven the confidence
which enabled them to win the
Yale game, in which their oppo
nents had scored first, and where
in running attack their opponents
had shown more power. It took a
team of the finest quality of nerves
to meet the issue that came up in
that contest, and it was the cool
ness and ability of Captain DeWitt
which enabled the Tigers to score

the winning five points by a field
kick goal in the last minute of the
game. No one had been able to
score on Princeton until she met
her big rivals, and the touchdown
which Yale hammered out was the
only beat on the season's remark
able record. The team was aggres
sive, self-reliant, and determined,
and these qualities brought them
throught to the top.''
What Camp has to na}' of Car
lisle is of interest because it now
seems probable that the Indians
will meet an all-California team in
San Francisco on Christmas Day.
His estimate of the Indians follows:
"The Carlisle Indians under
Coach Warner had a brilliant sea
son, almost beating Harvard, de
feating the University of Pennsyl
vania, and, although handicapped
by a wet field, they played a good

game with Princeton, and finally,
in what was called an East vs.
West match, overwhelmed North
western in Chicago 28-0. A con
test which all would have liked to
see would have been one between
Dartmouth and the Indians. The
Indians developed still further
their well-known trick-plays, and
one of them, the concealment of the
hall under a man's jersey, proved
disastrous to Harvard to the ex
tent of a touchdown. The Indians
were by no means wholly depen
dent upon trick-plavs, however, al
though there is no question hut
that they used these more than
any other team, and their more
legitimate plays were capital in
execution. Johnson, their captain,
was a good quarter and a very
dangerous man at trying for goals
from the field."
