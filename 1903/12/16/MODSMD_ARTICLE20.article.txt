# Class Comedy Progressing.
## 
### 
The class of 190G will present T.
W. Robertson's comedy, "David
Garrick," January 22, 1904. The
cast has been chosen and rehearsals
have been held regularly for the
past six weeks. The work of pre
senting the play is rendered par
ticularly difficult because of the
professional character of the piece.
The players, however, are suited to
the parts, and the characters
throughout are all well taken. The
costumes for the production will be
made by a San Francisco firm.
The committee on staging has
already procured some of the scen
ery necessary for the presentation,
and will have it all ready after
vacation. The purpose of the play
is to liquidate the class debt which
was incurred during the freshman
year of the class.
