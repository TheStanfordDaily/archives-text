The following letter has been
received by H. I'. Kuhn, '04, presi
dent of the Students' Guild, from
Dr. William Simpson, health oflicer
of Santa Clara county:
San Jose, Cal., Dec. 15, 1903.
Dear Sir: —I have at hind Dr.
Snow's report on the recent cases
of diphtheria in your community,
and 1 wish to express to you my
commendation of the prompt and
efficient work of your organization
in providing a detention hospital
for the quarantining of all cases,
suspected and established.
It will perhaps add to the force
of my appreciation when I say that

had you not had
matters so well in
hand and shown so
conclusively that
you were capable of
affording my depu
ty, Dr. Snow, every
facility he might
require in prevent
ing further spread
of the disease, it
would have been
necessary for us to
quarantine, at the
time of my visit,
the two halls and
the fraternities and
houses from which
cases were taken.
It is needless to
dwell on the great
expense and incon
venience this would
have occasioned
both to the UDiver
sity and to the
county. I had oc
casion last spring
to write President
Jordan compli
menting him on
the ability of your
organization to pro
vide for the typhoid
sufferers in Encina
Hall one of the best
equipped tempor
ary hospitals I have

lever seen. It is a further
| pleasure to see that you have
j now a permanent organization
i fully equipped for handling any
I emergency.
Very truly yours,
William Simpson,
County Health Officer.
