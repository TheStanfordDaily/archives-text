As REMARKABLE as the BUcldeil
ness with which the diphtheria
epidemic appeared has been the
success of the Students' Guild in
coping with the trouble. The or
ganization started in and took hold
of the situation with a perfect
understanding of its gravity, and
splendid results have issued with
not the least appearance of undue
publicity. The efficiency of the
Guild remains unnoticed until
emergencies arise, although its use
fulness always stands recognized.
What might have happened had
less faithful and efficient persons
been in charge of the association at
the outbreak of the diphtheria
cases may be gathered from the
letter written by the county health
officer and printed in today's
Daily Palo Alto. That the back
bone of the epidemic was broken
early is due in no small measure
to the Guild, and the University
owes it a debt of gratitude.
