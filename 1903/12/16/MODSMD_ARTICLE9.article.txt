### 
The English Club of the Uni
versity of California has decided to
give an old English play on the
occasion of the next Charter Day.
The play has not yet been chosen,
but it* will be either Robert
Green riar Bacon and Friar
Bungay#' or Ben Jonson's U A
Silent Woman." The choice be
tween the two is a matter of diffi
culty. Greene's "Friar Bacon and
Friar Bungay" would be the best
from a spectacular point of view
and is best suited to the big Greek
amphitheater, but the expense in
volved in its production would be
very great. Jonson's piece would
cost less and could be given in an
enclosed theater, but would not be
so effective a production.
The English Club at California
has been considering the question
of giving an old English play ever
since the success of "The Knight
of the Burning Pestle," given
by the Stanford English Club. The
California promoters propose to
equal if not surpass the success of
that production, and they will
bend every effort to outdo Stan
ford's work.
