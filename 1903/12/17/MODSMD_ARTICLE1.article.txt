### 
At the meeting of the Executive

of the Tennis Club submitted a re
port on the progress of collections

Committee agreed some time ago to
provide $250 for new courts, if the
Tennis Club would undertake to
collect $280 additional to cover the
deficit on the court in front of En
cina Hall. Manager Roseberry re
ported that approximately $100 in
cash has been collected, and that
bona fide promises of an equal
amount have been given. He said
that this was the best that could be
done with a popular subscrip-

tion at the present
time.
The plan is to
construct twocourts
of dirt and oil
beside the new as
phaltum court. It
has been roughly
estimated that
these will cost
about $125 each.

secure exact esti

tractors as to the
cost, and to report
