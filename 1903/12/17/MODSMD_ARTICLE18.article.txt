# PROJECTED ENTERTAINMENTS.
## Faculty Music Committee Flans to Bring Good Attractions Next Semester. 
### 
The faculty music committee is
making arrangements for the cham
ber concerts to be given next
semester. The program for the first,
which will take place sometime in
January, is practically complete.
There will be, as in the one already
given, a string quartet led by
lvopta. The soloist has not yet
been determined upon.
The quartet music will begin
with the old composers, like Haydn
and Mozart, and work gradually
down to the more modern composi
tions in the second and third con
certs, which will come later in the
semester.
Besides the chamber concerts the
committee is trying to secure a re
cital by Frau Schumann-Heinck,
who will be on the Coast sometime
in April. Madame Schumann-
Heinck is considered the greatest
contralto in the world at the pres
ent time. Her regular position is
in the Royal Theater at Dresden.
While it is not definitely decided,
the committee hopes to be able to
secure her, although a heavy guar
antee will be necessary, as she will
stay but ten days in California.
