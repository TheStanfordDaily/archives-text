# WILL NOT PLAY MINNESOTA.
## California Unable to Reach Agreement with the Big Eastern Eleven. 
### 
The football game between Cali
fornia and Minnesota, which was
scheduled to be played in San
Francisco on New Year's Day, has
been called off. After two weeks of
negotiations, the managers of the
two teams were unable to come to
an understanding as to the
financial terms, and consequently
the executive committee of the Cal
ifornia associated students yester
day cancelled the whole plan. The
Minnesota manager has replied
that he will hold California to the
contract made by its representative
at Denver. Manager Decoto of
California was willing to stand by
this contract, but he put upon it

adifferentconstruc
tion than did the
Minnesota mana
ger. In speaking
of the situation
Manager Decoto
said the Minnesota
managers were
avaricious. They
had figured it out
that the receipts
would hea bout
.$lO,OOO, and were
too anxious to get
a large share of
this.
The Californians
are in fact glad to
be free of the bar
gain, for the enter
prise gave some in
dications of being a
failure. To come
out even it would
have been neces
sary to raise $C>,ooo,
and the conditions
were anything but
favorable. The Cali
fornia players were
in no condition and
had lost interest,
and it seemed prob
able that there
would be a game
with the Carlisle
Indians a weak
earlierwhich would

materially cut down the profits of
the Minnesota game. It is stated
that a number of California's best
men will play against the Indians.
