# New Office for Registration.
## 
### 
The work of reconstructing the
old Geology department rooms be
tween the chapel and the Regis
trar's present quarters has been
completed, and the painters and
varnishers are now busy. They
will complete their work in two or
three days, and after the place has
dried, the Registrar will move into
his new offices at once, so that
everything will be in place for the
opening of the spring semester in
January. The present offices of
the Registrar will be added to the
President's office.
