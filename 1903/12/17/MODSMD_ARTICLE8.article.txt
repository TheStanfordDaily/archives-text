After many discouraging fail
ures on the part of those who have
attempted to manage the Univer
sity Inn, it has been demonstrated
that the enterprise can be con
ducted and carried to a successful
financial conclusion. It is very
gratifying that the present man
agement of the Inn has been able
to meet the wants of the residents
of Encina and at the same time
make a paying proposition out of
the undertaking. This season the
patronage of the Inn has been
small, owing to the reluctance of
men to return to a place where
they had received poor food at ex
cessive rates, and to the additional
fact that man}' of the men had
entered into agreements to eat at
other places during the college year.
Next semester the number of Inn
boarders ought to be larger, mak
ing a corresponding increase in the
quality of the food and the effici
ency of the service. The fact that
the Inn will remain open during
the Christmas recess is a sufficient
evidence that the management is
endeavoring to serve the wants of
the students.
