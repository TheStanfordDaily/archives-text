# BOATING PLANS.
## Practices for Class Regattas Will Begin Second Week of February. 
### 
The plans of the Stanford Boat
ing Club for next semester have
been completed. The boats which
were ordered a short time ago are
expected to arrive by the middle of
February. It is expected that by
this time the lake will be filled, so
that practice for the class regatta
can begin. Prof. A. W. Smith will
coach the men who come out for
practice. The practice hours will
be from 4:30 to 6 p.m., daily. The
old barge which is now owned by
the club will be used for practice
by the new men, and as they show
improvement they will be allowed
to use the new pair-oared boats.
At present there are a number of
men in the University who have
had some experience in rowing, and
it is expected that by the time the
class regatta takes place there will
be enough new men developed at
Stanford so that the regatta will be
of material value in developing
candidates for a Varsity crew. The
sport is new at Stanford, and the
interest of the student body at
large has not been deeply aroused.
The Boating Club expects this class
regatta to be the means of promot
ing general interest and directing
attention to the sport.
