A handsome gold watch is to be

as a gift from the men and women
of the University, who take this
means of expressing their personal
appreciation of his work in produc
ing Stanford's strong football team.
The watch was forwarded from
San Francisco today to Denver,
where Lanagan has gone to spend
the holidays with his mother. Jt
should reach him on Tuesday or
Wednesday. The watch is of dull
yellow gold and has an open face.
Upon the back Lanagan's initials,
"J. F. L.," are engraved, and on
the back of the inner case is the
following inscription:
" A Token of Appreciation from
the Students of Leland Stanford
Junior University, J903."
The idea of presenting Lanagan
with some mark of appreciation
came soon after the game, when it
was suggested that the Executive
Committee give him a gold football
or something similar. It was
deemed best to make the gift one
from the students, however, and
subscriptions were so willingly
given that enough was secured to
pay for a watch.
