# Punting Cup Not Awarded.
## 
### 
The cup which was offered by the
Quadrangle Club to Captain Bans
bach, to be giveni to the best punt
er of the past season, will not be
awarded until next semester. The
punting averages of the football
men were taken daily during the
football season, and from these
averages Captain Bansbach and
Coach Lanagan will decide to
whom the cup shall belong for one
season. The cup, as is stipulated
in the agreement, must be won
three successive years before it can
become the permanent property of
the winner.
The two men whose daily punt
ing averages have been the highest,
and who did the best punting in
the intercollegiate game, are W. H.
Dole, '05, and Sprott, '06.
