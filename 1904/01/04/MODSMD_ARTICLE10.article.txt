# DETENTION HOSPITAL CLOSED.
## Last Diphtheria Patient Was Discharged from Care This Afternoon. 
### 
The Detention Hospital, located I
in the old Psychology laboratory, af
ter having been open over four weeks
was closed this afternoon. The
last patient, though cured of diph
theria, was too weak to be entirely
discharged from care, and was re
moved to the Guild Hospital in
Palo Alto. Miss Du Bose, the head j
nurse who has been in charge since;
the opening of the hospital, will
leave tomorrow after thoroughly
disinfecting the building.
During the period that the hospi
tal has been open thirteen cases of
diphtheria have been cured and
seven suspects have been temporar
ily detained. All cases of actual
diphtheria were kept in the hospi
tal during a period varying from
twelve days to three weeks, but in
none of these cases did the disease
assume a malignant form, probably
on account of the liberal use of anti
toxin.
The expense of running the De
tention Hospital during the time
which it was open amounts to
$1200, a part of which will be cov
ered by the daily rate of one dollar
due from each patient. No extra
fee was charged the patients, so
that this rate will not be unjust to
those students who were detained
on suspicion in order that the
spieau of the disease might by
checked and the health of the
community effectually protected.
It is the hope of the Guild man
agement by another year to be fully
prepared to handle contagious dis
eases as well as those of a less
dangerous nature.
