# Changes in Student Guild.
## 
### 
The membership fee of the Stu
dents' Guild, formerly one dollar,
has been raised to two dollars for
the present semester. The lower
fee was barely enough to meet
current expenses of the Guild
hospital, and the threatened
diphtheria epidemic of last semes
ter created a heavy additional ex
pense. In order to meet the deficit,
it was found necessary to raise the
membership fee.
Hereafter the privileges of the
Guild are to be extended to those
members of the faculty who pay
the regular membership fee to the
Guild treasurer before the end of
January. Faculty patients will
be charged a hospital fee of one
dollar and a half a day, instead of
the student rate of one dollar.
