The field of a college daily paper
differs from that of a metropolitan
journal, along whose lines it has
been developed, in that it is not
partisan, not sensational, and not
devoted to the exposition of one
man's personal views. The prov
ince of the Daily Palo Alto has
always been two-fold : to cover the
news field of the college, and to
represent, editorially, the sentiment
of a majority of the students. The
one of these has been growing con
tinually more easy ; as the person
nel of the board has increased in
efficiency, so has its power to accu
mulate all of the news become
greater and greater. The other has
become continually more difficult:
as the student body has increased
in numbers, so have its elements
become more divergent in senti
ment, and the opinion of the ma
jority more difficult to discover.
Nevertheless, these two problems
are those which always w'ill meet
an incoming editor; the answers
will have been more or less satis
factorily discovered by this same
editor when it comes his turn to
vacate. The field of news-gathering
has become more easy to cover as a
position on the board has become
less easy to obtain. Competition
for places during the last three
years has been growing keener and
keener, until today no man's name
appears on the board who has not
successfully passed through a try
out period and given satisfactory
evidence of the seriousness and per
manency of his intentions in regard
to the paper. Under the system
that was instituted by the last
editor of the Daily Palo Alto the
membership of the board was lim
ited to fifteen; this limitation will
remain in effect. No one will be
elected to a vacancy on the board
unless, in competition, he shall
have given evidence of his ability

and his sincerity. No one will be
promoted to the rank of associate
editor unless his work shall be of
such a character that the promo
tion is his due. There will be
always a place for a good man, and
honest effort combined with ordi
nary ability, if adhered to for a
long enough period, will make any
one a valuable man. There will be
a competition for candidates to till
the vacancies on the existing board.
The competition will begin imme
diately, and the election will take
place the first of March. Every
one whose interest lies in this di
rection is earnestly invited to try.
A meeting of board and candidates
will be held on Wednesday at 1:30
in the office of the Daily Palo
Alto.
