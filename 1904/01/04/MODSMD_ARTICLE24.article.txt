# WILL PRESERVE TABLETS.
## Museum Will Endeavor to Keep Records of Assyrian Cylinders. 
### 
The most important of the tab
lets and cylinders in the Assyrian
collection presented to the Museum
by Thomas Welton Stanford are
being photographed in detail by
E. A. Austin, assistant curator.
The purpose is to have a perma
nent record and to furnish authen
tic copies to students of Assyrian
archaeology. Owing to disintegra
tion due to action of the air, it has
been found necessary to make pho
tographic copies in order to preserve
the legibility of the records. It is
hoped by means of the lens to
bring out details which are too
minute for the human eye to dis
cern. Edward Wesson, member of
the Association of Biblical Research
and corresponding member of the
British Museum, is devoting con
siderable time to the translation of
these tablets, and it is expected
that these photographs will he of
great value to him in his studies of
these ancient records. The most
important of the photographs will
also be sent to E. A. Wallis Budge,
Litt. 1)., D. Lit., F. S. A., curator of
the Egyptian and Assyrian antiqui
ties in the British Museum. He
ranks as the highest authority in
the world on this subject.
This collection, which was re
ceived last summer, contains many
exceedingly valuable specimens,
among which it is expected that
one will prove of unusual worth.
It is in the shape of a crouching
sphinx, with an Egyptian cartouche
seal on the top. On the two sides
appear representations of the Cop
tic bird. Although the hieroglyph
ics are very indistinct, the name of
King Khu-en-aten, or Amenophis
IV, of the XVIIIth Dynasty, has
been deciphered. If the the tablet
is authentic —and there is little
doubt on this score—it is probably
the oldest record in the United
States.
With the other tablets are cylin
ders, royal seals, and bas-reliefs, on
which Mr. Wesson is now working.
11 e has discerned on them inscrip
tions relating to the time of King
Sargon, King Cyrus, and Nimrod,
the hunter king.
As soon as the negatives are fin
ished the tablets will be treated
with a preparation similar to that
used by the British Museum for
the preservation of all such mate
rial, which, owing to its frailty,
must be thoroughly protected from
the action of the air.
