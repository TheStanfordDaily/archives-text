# Marking System Unchanged. Outlook for Inn.
## 
### 
The University Inn has served
meals regularly during the Christ
mas recess. Students who had
boarded at clubs on College Terrace
were greatly accommodated in this
way, and several of the clubs have
decided to return to the Inn per
manently. The outlook for a suc
cessful semester is very good as
many students have already re
turned, and there are accommoda
tions for more than 200. The
prices of last semester will remain
in force next term.
