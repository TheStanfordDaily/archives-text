# Venetian Collection Arrives.
## 
### 
The second consignment of (he
Venetian glass exhibit presented to
the Museum by Salviati & (Jam
erino of Venice is now being in
stalled in the Venetian room. This
lot consists of five beautifully exe
cuted Venetian chandeliers, pat
terned after old styles and early
designs. The designs sue varied,
and are of an unusual nature, with
a predominance of opalescent and
cut-glass effects, producing beauti
ful results. The figures used for
the motif include the Venetian sea
horse, driven by the dolphin; and
salamanders and marine plants
and flowers. The Hococo, which is
a decided departure from the gen
eral plan followed in the others, is
made up of a large pendent vase,
from which springs a cluster of
tropical flowers varying in shades
of color.
This latest addition to the Vene
tian room makes it one of the most
attractive collections of the Muse
um. When all the material given
by Salviati & Camerino is finally
installed Stanford will possess the
most complete Venetian art-glass
collection in the United States.
