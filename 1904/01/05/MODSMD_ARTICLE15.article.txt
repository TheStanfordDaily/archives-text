It is very much to l>e regretted
that the Carlisle Indians on their
recent Western trip were not op
posed to either the Stanford or the
California Varsity. There are many
causes that operate to make an
opportunity for a Western team to
face an Eastern eleven very rare.
When such a chance is offered, a
test of the comparative strength of
Eastern and Western football can
be applied, and it is to be regretted
that any such test is not as fair as
possible. Certainly California did
not place in the field the best team
that could have been developed.
The Sherman Indians are admit
tedly weaker than the Varsity
elevens of either the University of
California or Stanford, and the
Reliance team lacked training,
coaching, and practice. Unthink
ing Eastern critics will look only
at the scores, and say that a
second-rate Eastern eleven is better
than California's beat teams. Such
a verdict will be unjust. There is
a general and well-grounded im
pression that had Carlisle been
pitted against either varsity the
result would have been questionable
and the score close. Should an
opportunity for a Western team to
face an Eastern eleven offer itself
again next year it is to be hoped
that the details of the game may
be arranged so that one of the uni
versities can be represented. The
game with the Sherman Indians
can not be used as a test of the
merits of Carlisle's play, as the
Eastern eleven was out of condi
tion owing to its long trip, and
Johnson, its famous quarter-back,
was crippled throughout the game.
