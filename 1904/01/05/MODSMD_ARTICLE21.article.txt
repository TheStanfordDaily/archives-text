## Carlisle Indians Defeat All-California Eleven and Sherman Indian Team. 
### 
The Carlisle Indian eleven played
on Christmas Day in San Francisco
against the Reliance Club men, or
ganized as the all-California eleven,
and defeated them by the score of
23-0. On New Year's Day the
Sherman Indians were the oppo
nents of the Eastern team and were
defeated in Los Angeles by the
score of 12-6, although owing to a
questionable ruling of the umpire
it was claimed that the final score
should have been 6-6.
In offering a comparison of East
ern and Western football the two
games with Carlisle were singularly
unsatisfactory. On the lir.-t occa
sion their .adversaries, while num
bering in their ranks some of the
best individual players on the
Coast, were unconditioned and un
trained for a hard contest. In Los
Angeles the Carlisle eleven was,
itself, out of condition owing to its
long trip, and suffered from the
crippling of its star quarter-back.
The games were important, how
ever, because they opened the eyes
of Western football players to the
scoring power possessed by a light
eleven when offensive team work is
highly developed. Carlisle de
pended neither upon weight nor
entirely upon trick plays to make
her scores, but by a well-developed
offensive play managed to carry
the heavier Reliance players off
their feet. The Los Angeles game
would have been more interesting
had Carlisle been in better physical
condition and had Johnson been
able to play throughout the con
test. One thing is clear, however,
that Western football is not nearly
so far behind the game as it is
played in the East as Eastern crit
ics have been accustomed to claim.
There is little question that had
either Stanford or California been
pitted against Carlisle under the
same conditions with which they
faced each other, the struggle
would have been extremely close,
with more than a possibility of vic
tory in favor of either Western
eleven. The Carlisle Indians dur
ing their two games on the Coast
played a kind of football that crit
ics were unanimous in holding to
be clean, fast, and hard.
