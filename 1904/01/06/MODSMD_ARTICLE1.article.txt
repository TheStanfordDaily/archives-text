# DEBATING CONTESTS.
## Annual Interclass Event on January 15th Will be First Exhibition of Year. 
### 
The first important debating
event of the year will occur Friday
evening, January 15th, when the
Sophomores and Freshmen will
hold the annual interclass debate.
The following evening the try-outs
will take place for the selection of
the Carnot team which will meet
the representatives of California at
Berkeley on the evening of Febru
ary 6th. The try-outs for the
annual intercollegiate debate will
follovy theCarnot in close succession,
and the intercollegiate debate will
be held in San Francisco near the
middle of April.
The interclass debate of January
15th is the most important contest
that will be held at the University.
Of the class now in college 1904
won both Freshman and Sopho
more debates; 1905 lost the Fresh
man debate but won in its Sopho
more year from 1906. which now
has a last opportunity to win a
contest. From the try-outs held
last semester the Sophomores
appear to have the better balanced
team, but this may be offset by
the advantage the Freshmen
secured in winning the choice of
sides. The subject to be debated
deals with the advisability of grant
ing statehood to the territories of
Arizona and New Mexico.
The outlook for Stanford in this
year's Carnot debate is much more
promising than it was in 1903.
Entered in the try-outs are H. M.
Lewis, '04, Frank Roehr, '04, O. H.
Ritter, '04, A. Sheriffs, '05, A. M.
Dibble, '05, R. G. Barnett, '05, D.
I). Sales, '06, and A. B. Rhuart, '04.
The first three contestants com
posed last year's Carnot team, and
all of them, owing Â°to their addi
tional experience, may be expected
to show an improvement over their
work of last year. The team for
the coming contest will, however,
not necessarily be composed of the
same men who took part last year.
In the list of entries are other
debaters who have had as wide
debating experience as the veterans,
and who are not behind them in
ability, so that it is not improbable
that changes in the personnel of
the team will result from the try
outs. At any rate, with the veteran
trio and several other promising
candidates, it is highly probable
that the Carnot medal this year
will be captured by a Stanford
speaker.
The victorious intercollegiate
team of last year will be crippled
by the loss of O. C. Spencer, '04,
who was practically certain of a
place on the team had he entered
for the debates this year. Lewis,
'04, and Roehr, '04, will both try
for this event again; and Dibble,
'05, alternate last year, and Ritter,
'04, of the 1903 Carnot team, will
also be among those who will enter
the try-outs. The fact that these
four men will enter is surety that
the team will be an unusually
strong one. The number of entries
for the intercollegiate debate will,
as usual, be much larger than the
number of entries for the Carnot.
Since the intercollegiate contest

will come later in the semester it
will allow theunderclass debaters to
enter their names in the try-outs,
and also will give new students,
entering the University at the be
ginning of the second semester, an
opportunity to participate.
Both the Carnot and the inter
collegiate debates are now in a gen
eral way under the supervision of
the University Debating Club, an
organization formed in May, 1903,
for the purpose of directing the
debating policy of the University.
The club has elected J. F. English,
'01, E. W. Rice, 'o'2, and O. C.
Spencer, '04, to the intercollegiate
debating committee, which will
confer with the committee of the
University of California in regard
to the judges and question for the
intercollegiate debate.
