Jt is an encouraging feature of
the amateur sport of this country
that a man like Caspar Whitney,
who is an undisputed authority in
athletics, has such a whole-souled
interest in developing the cleaner
and more manly features of sport
ing life. In this attempt he is
absolutely fearless and entirely un
controlled by hostile criticism. The
men whom he selected for the all-
America eleven are not, in every
instance, the men who have been
chosen by a consensus of opinion
on the part of other football author
ities. At least two names that
found a place on the all-America
elevens of a dozen other critics
were omitted from the list prepared
by Caspar Whitney, not because
hey were not good players —per-
haps the best in their positions—but
because they did not come within
the eligibility test established by
him —that a man be a clean, ama
teur sportsman. Such a stand by
such an authority is extremely
praiseworthy, and can not fail to
produce the desired effect. Fear
less criticism by a man whose word
is final in the sporting world will
do much to elevate the tone of
national athletics, even though it
be by an indirect method only,—
that of making the spectators call
for cleanliness and amateurism in
the games they witness.
