# PROPOSED ORGANIZATION.
## American Historical Association Considers Establishment of Pacific Coast Branch. 
### 
At the last meeting of the Amer
ican Historical Association, which
was held in New Orleans, December
29thâ€”31st, a plan was considered
for organizing a branch of the
main society to be known as the
Pacific Coast Branch of the Amer
ican Historical Association. The
object of such an association would
be to advance the interests of the
national branch, and to promote
historical studies on the Pacific
Coast. The field of the new organ
ization would include all the terri
tory west of the Rocky mountains.
According to the plan all members
of the American Association resid
ing in this district, who so desire,
would become ipso facto members
of the Coast branch.
Papers presented at meetings of
the local society, which the execu
tive committee deem worthy, will
be sent to the executive council of
the national association, to be pub
lished in the annual report of the
association. It was further ar
ranged in case the Pacific branch
should be organized, that the presi
dent, or a delegate, should be sent
to attend the executive council of
the American Historical Associa
tion, and that the national associa
tion should make appropriations
covering the expenses of the Pacific
branch. The offer is being consid
ered by the historical men of the
West and the Western branch will
without doubt be organized in a
short time. The professors of Stan
ford and California will be behind
the movement and whether or net
the organizatisn will be effected
will depend upon their efforts.
