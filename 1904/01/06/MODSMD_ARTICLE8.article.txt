# Pamphlets Are Classified.
## 
### 
Large numbers of miscellaneous
pamphlets have been received at
the University Library since its
opening, and these have been stored
loosely in the basement. These
pamphlets, which now number
12,000, have recently been classi
fied and have been placed on
shelves in the basement, and ar
ranged in form which will allow of
easy distribution. The authors'
catalogue to the pamphlets has
been placed in the reference room
of the Library, and makes access
possible to this material which
heretofore has been useless for the
purposes of study and research.
There are still 1000 pamphlets to
be classified and arranged before
the work is completed.
