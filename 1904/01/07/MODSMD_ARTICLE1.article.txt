# JUNIOR ANNUAL.
## 1905 "Quad" Assuming Shape. Literary and Art Features Will Be Emphasized. 
### 
Preparations for the publication
of the 1905 annual are rapidly as
suming definite form. Enough
material lias been promised to in
sure an excellent issue this year.
The literary editor has departed
from the old method of offering a
number of prizes, and offers only
two: one of $7.50 for the best poem,
and one of $12.50 for the best story
of the year. There are but few
restrictions in the competition.
Previous publication is no bar to
acceptance, the only condition
being that the contestant must
have been a student in the Univer
sity since February 1, 1903, and
that the work submitted must have
been done since that date. The
contest closes on the first of Feb
ruary.
The Quad will be dedicated to
George E. Crothers, '95, the only
alumnus who is a member of the
Board of Trustees of the University.
Dr. Jordan will contribute the
introductory article. The other
lending articles are written by Pro
fessor Farrand, who has taken
"Athletics" as his subject, and
Charles K. Field, '95, who will con
tribute a page on "The Stanford
Spirit."
Aside from the prize poem and
story, the Quad will contain poems
by many well-known Stanford
graduates. Wallace Irwin, ex-'Ol,
Mildred Stanford, '01, and W. H.
Irwin, '99, have promised contribu
tions, and it is very probable that
11. E. Renaud, ex-'O3, and L. M.
Bowman,'ol, will contribute verses.
If permission can be secured
from Paul Elder cfc Company, pub
lishers of the ode written by Dr.
Alden in commemoration of those
who died in the typhoid epidemic,
the poem will be reproduced. The
best piece of verse that has appeared
this year in the Sequoia will be
reprinted.
The outlook for drawings is ex
cellent. R. W. Borough, '04, de
signed the cover, besides a series of
drawings entitled "The Stanford
Farm." The Japanese artist, Shi
mada, will probably do some work,
and all of the artists who have
drawn for the Quad in past years
have been asked to contribute to
the 1905 annual. Bristow Adams,
ex-'O2, 11. K. Culver, '99, and R. J.
Sterrett, '03, have promised to con
tribute. The three best drawings
from the Chaparral will be re
printed.
In the other departments of the
book few changes will be made.
Instead of photographs of the fra
ternities, inserts will be made. The
usual athletic pictures will be pub
lished, as well as a series of views
devoted to the University happen
ings of the past year.
The comic department will be
more limited than in former issues,
as the editors desire the 1905 an
nual to be distinctively a Stanford
record that will be of reference use
in the future.
