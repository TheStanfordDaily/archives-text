It is the rule rather thiui the
exception that the editorial work
of the class annuals has been
promptly and conscientiously done
but several times in the past the
publication of the Quaa has only
been the forestep to a class assess
ment to cover a deficit caused by
poor management. Perhaps in
individual cases this may have
been the fault of the business man
ager, but certainly in a majority of
cases it has been a result towards
which the whole Junior class has
contributed by indifference and
delay. To a great extent the suc
cess of the annual depends upon
the manner in which the different
college organizations and the indi
vidual members of the class stand
by the business manager ; if they
are prompt in meeting their obliga
tions his work will be made easy
and the success of the book assured;
if they are dilatory he will be hand
icapped on every side and the
ultimate outcome of the venture
be rendered uncertain. The soon
er every member of the class
and every organization of the
college learns to co-operate with
the business manager in his work,
the sooner will the Junior class be
certain that the Quad will not be a
financial failure. There is little
question that the editorial work on
the 1905 Quad will be up to the
standard of its predecessors; this
year the class could well establish
a precedent in helping the business
manager make t'6 issue success
ful financially.
