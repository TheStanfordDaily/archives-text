# BASEBALL OUTLOOK.
## Abundant Material in Sight for the Development of a Successful Team. 
### 
From present indications the
baseball material from which the
1904 Varsity nine must be devel
oped appears to be more plentiful
than was anticipated earlier in the
college year. While it remains
true that many of the best men of
last year's team have left college
there has come to the front a wealth
of new material which a season of
thorough coaching may be expected
to develop into lirst-rate Varsity
players. There is a number of first
year men who have figured promi
nently on preparatory school teams.
Among this number are: A. J.
Chalmers, G. C. McLain, E. A.
Nissen, E. P. Stott, and W. P.
lvelley. These men form an
unusually strong nucleus from
which to develop a Freshman
class team.
The veterans who will be out for
their old positions are Ball, '04,
Tritcb, '04, Williams, '06, Trow
bridge, '05, Blake, '04, Crawford,
'04, Knight, '04, and Wirt, '00.
Tritcb, one of last year's Varsity
pitchers,is not in college at present,
but is expected back in a few days.
Parker, '03, who is taking graduate
work, will not be eligible to pitch
owing to the four years rule. Cap
tain Ball will go back to the catch
er's position which he held in 1901,
but should Stott be able to fill this
place Ball will probably return to
third base. Bales, '06, Roosevelt,
'04, and Tritcb, '04, will try for
supremacy in the pitcher's box.
Blake, '04, Col bert, '06, and possibly
Trowbridge, '05, will try out for
first base. Williams, '06, will have
to compete for second base against
a number of second team players.
Crawford, '04, is a fixture at short
stop. Third base will be filled by
Hall when he is not behind the bat.
Litt, '06, will also try for third
base. Wirt, '06, Knight,'o4, and a
number of second team men will
be candidates forth 6 outfield.
