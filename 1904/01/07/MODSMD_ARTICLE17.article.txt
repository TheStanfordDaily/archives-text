# WORK AT MUSEUM.
## Process of Renovation Carried on by Curator Peterson.-Building Overcrowded. 
### 
During the Christinas vacation
a large amount of work was done
at the Museum in arranging old
exhibits and installing new ones.
Owing to the congested state of near
ly all of the collections, it was found
necessary to open a new depart
ment, that of textiles, which is now
found in room M. Part of the
material for this exhibit was
removed from room J, though a
large amount is new material pre
sented by Mrs. Stanford. Room J
has been converted into a depart
ment devoted to collections from
the South Sea Islands, Hawaii,
Mexico, Australia, and other places
from which the respective
exhibits are not sufficient to entitle
them to individual rooms, Even
with the opening of new rooms it
has been impossible to display the
exhibits to advantage ; a shortage
of cases prevents the utilization of
the only room in the present build
ing which remains vacant. The
completion of the new additions
now under construction will solve
the problem of overcrowded rooms.
Material additions to the mineral
rooms have been made and the
specimens have been rearranged
and classified by Assistant Curator
Austin. Two new cases of fine
specimens of petrified wood, one
new case of Coast fossils, a case of
quartz crystals, and four cases of
general mineral specimens are
among the additions. One partic
ularly rare acquisition is a piece of
cinnabar containing numberless
globules of pure mercury. One
entire case has been filled with
California gold-bearing quartz.
Mineral collections from the Ural
Mountains, Bavaria, New Zealand,
Mexico, Siberia, and Arizona are
exhibited in other cases. An agate
collection containing large and
valuable pieces, three of which were
shown at the Columbian Exposi
tion has been received.
In the Natural History room the
birds' eggs have been transferred
from table- to wall-cases where
they are displayed to much better
advantage. There have been pre
sented by Mrs. Stanford two beau
tiful lyre-tails, three herons from
St. Augustine, Florida, and a large
winter wren's nest, the gift of J. O.
Snyder, assistant professor of
Zoology.
For the past two weeks Curator
Peterson has been engaged in clean
ing and oiling the paintings in the
South gallery. These are now being
varnished. Two years ago the
paintings in the North art gallery
underwent the same process at the
hands of Herr Henri Raschen of
Munich. Mr. Peterson has since
taken special instruction under
Mr. Raschen in this craft, and it is
expected that by the end of the

year all the paintings in the
Museum will have been putin
good condition.
