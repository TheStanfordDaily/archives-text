# RANKING OF ELEVENS.
## Caspar Whitney Reviews Football Season in January "Outing." 
### 
In the current issue of Outing,
Caspar Whitney, the authority on
all branches of amateur sport, has
an exhaustive and interesting re
view of the football season of 1908.
An especially attractive feature of
his article is a table of the compar
ative standing of the college teams
for the year. Prefatory to this
table he says:
"This ranking is based not only
on comparative scores, but on style
of play, conditions under which
games were contested, relative im
portance of games in the schedule,
as well as the season's all-round
record of the elevens under discus
sion. My particular interest in
the study is the object-lesson it fur
nishes on comparative football de
velopment throughout the country.

"There is no possible line of com
parison on the Pacific Coast college
teams, but from what I have seen
of their play, and on the scores of
the season, California and Stanford
would fall in somewhere near the
first-raters of the South, and Wash
ington with Missouri."
