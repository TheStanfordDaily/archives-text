# TRACK PROSPECTS.
## Outlook Points to a Successful Season.â€”Old Varsity Men Return. 
### 
Although the track team has
lost several good men since the last
intercollegiate field-meet, the large
number of new candidates gives
promise that Stanford will be ably
represented in the annual contest
with California next spring. A
number of track aspirants are
already at work, but the regular
season will not begin until the first
of February. At that time track
men will be allowed to substitute
outdoor work for class work in the
gymnasium. The men will not be
required to sign training-rules, but
the first one who breaks the un
written law will be expelled from
the team, and have his gymnasium
substitution privileges revoked.
The track management has been
considerably disturbed over the
loss of distance men, but the old
runners who have returned to col
lege this semester partly solved
the difficulty. Waring, '05, who is
out for the two-mile run, promises
to be a point-winner in that event.
Stiles, '00, who made a good show
ing in the distances last year, has
returned to college. Borough, '04,
will again compete in the distances.
Captain Holman and several good
freshmen will be entered in the
mile.. The departure of Thomson,
'04, and Smith, '05, leaves a big
gap to be tilled in the half-mile
run. A large number have signi
fied their intention of trying for
this event, but as yet none of them
have shown unusual speed.
The sprints present a greater
array of track talent than any
other event. Dunn, '04, Crossman,
'04, and Turpi n, '06, form the
nucleus for the dashes.
The hurdles present the most
perplexing problem to the track
management. Kuhn, '04, will not
return to college, and although
Weller, '00, may be back, his in
jured leg will keep him from par
ticipating in this event.
A. S. Henley, '04, has returned
to college and will compete in the
jumps. Stanford will be represented
in the jumps and in the pole-vault
by almost the same men who com
peted in those events last year. It
is quite likely, however, that com
petition will be close, for some of
the new men who are trying out
for places on the team are showing
good form.
The loss of Crawford, '05, in the
weights is one of the most serious
blows that the track team has re
ceived, and there is little probability
that the new men who are trying
with the hammer and the shot will
be able to approach Crawford's
form by the end of the season.
