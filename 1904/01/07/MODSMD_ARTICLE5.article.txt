# TRY-OUT JUDGES SELECTED.
## Annual Contest of High School Debating League Has Been Postponed. 
### 
The judges who will select the
1904 Carnot debating team on the
evening of January 16th have been
chosen by the executive committee
of the Intersociety Debating League.
C. A. Duniway, associate professor
of History, E. I). Adams, associate
professor of History, and R. M.
Alden, assistant, professor of Eng
lish, will officiate.
The debate between the Alameda
high school and the Commercial
Evening school of San Francisco,
scheduled to take place at Stanford
February 6th, will be postponed
until a later date, on account of a
conflict with the Carnot debate,
which will be held at Berkeley that
night. The prize for the inter
scholastic contest is a silver cup,
which was offered by the Associated
Students to the winning team in
the Central California High School
Debating League. The cup is
awarded for one year to the victo
rious team, and becomes the perma
nent property of any school win
ning three years in succession.
Alameda high school won the tro
phy from Lodi last year, and will
defend it in the coming contest
against the Commercial Evening
school of San Francisco, which has
defeated the other schools repre
sented in the league.
