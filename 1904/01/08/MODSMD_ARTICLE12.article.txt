It is a matter for congratulation
that steps have been taken to pro
vide fire facilities and organize an
efficient tire department on the
campus. The houses on the row
present a particularly susceptible
mark to the attack of a fire. Un
less there were some organization
at hand when the fire started, not
a house would be left standing
should a high wind be blowing.
University residents can ill afford
to depend on outside aid in case of
an emergency, for the necessary
delay would be fatal should a
severe fire remain unchecked for
any length of time. A local organ
ization, however, provided with
facilities for fighting the fire, could
cope with any conflagration that is
likely to break out, and the estab
lishment of such a volunteer corps
will do much to increase the safety
of the campus houses.
