# May Not Enter Loft.
## 
### 
After the organization of Memo
rial Church choir has been com
pleted, no one except members will
be allowed in the choir-loft during
the morning service or afternoon
recital. During the past semester
the organist was greatly annoyed
by students and visitors coming
into the choir-loft during the ser
vices, and Mr. Joseph Smith has
adopted the plan of excluding
everyone in order to do away witii
the disturbance caused by people
coming in or leaving the loft.
