# BASKET-BALL PLANS.
## Large Number of Experienced Players in College.â€” Many Games Anticipated. 
### 
A call has been issued by the
men in charge of basket-ball forall
those who ar,e interested in the
game to sign for work before Mon
day. During this semester basket
ball work will probably be in charge
of H. W. Chappel, '01, who will be
assisted by Norman Collyer, '04,
and J. C. Cahoon, '06. There are
a large number of men interested
in the sport who have expressed
their willingness to try for the
team. All of the freshmen who
played against the California fresh
men last semester are back. Ga
boon, '06, Stearns, '06, West, '06,
Collyer, '04, Miller, '05. and Avery,
'05, members of last year's squad,
are also eligible. With the addi
tion of the freshmen, the team this
year should be unusually strong.
The freshmen who will try out are:
J. H. Conover, G. E. Dole, F. M.
Redman, G. J. Presley, F. E. Par
doe, members of the Freshman
team; and C. W. Henderson, J. P.
.Stephenson, and C. S. Morrow. A
meeting of the candidates will be
held in the gymnasium on Tuesday
afternoon. I'ractice will probably
begin on the following Thursday.
The Stanford team will again
belong to the Bay League, which
will be composed of teams repre
senting the University of California,
the Y. M. C. A. of San Francisco,
and of Oakland, Stanford, and pos
sibly a team from San Jose. Each
team will play two games with all
the other teams of the league, one
on home grounds and the second
away from home. The schedule
has not been made out, but the
first contest will in all probability
take place about February 13th.
