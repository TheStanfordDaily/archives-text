# CAMPUS FIRE DEPARTMENT.
## Apparatus Purchased and Complete Code of Signals Formulated for University. 
### 
The campus fire department has
undergone a thorough reorganiza
tion at the hands of the University
authorities. The old hose-carts
have been repaired and furnished
with new reels and supplemented
by the addition of a hook and
ladder, which has been ordered and
will arrive soon.
A complete code of signals has
been formulated and printed on
placards, which are being posted in
conspicuous places on the campus.
In case of lire the signal will be
blown from the whistle on the roof
of the power-house. The whistle
will be blown daily at 12:15 to
insure it against failure in case of
emergency.
The Encina gymnasium man
agement will operate with the
University authorities for the pro
tection of the campus residents
against fire. The University will
soon appoint a fire chief, and to
assist him O. S. Lousley, '05, and
R. R. Long, '05, will act as volun
teers from the gymnasium. The
gymnasium fire drills, which were
inaugurated last year, will be con
tinued at intervals during the
spring semester, and those taking
part in this exercise will probably
be asked to form themselves into a
volunteer fire brigade.

fires follow:
