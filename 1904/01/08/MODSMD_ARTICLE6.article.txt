# BOATING PROSPECTS.
## Preparations Are Being Made by Boat Club for Class Regattas. 
### 
The executive committee of the
Stanford Boating Club has prac
tically completed arrangements for
the spring regatta. The L-shaped
course, four-fifths of a mile in
length, has been surveyed and
buoys are being placed to mark
the turning-points. The boat
house, which is now situated on
the north shore of the lake, will
probably be moved to the south
west corner, where the bottom
slopes more gradually and enables
the boats to be handled more care
fully. An expert workman from
San Francisco is expected in a few
days to overhaul the four-oared
barge and the pair-oared boat, so
that as soon as the lake fills prac
tice can be begun at once. The
two new pair-oared boats will ar
rive about March Ist.
The class regatta is expected to
generate interest in the sport, and
to develop men for future intercol
legiate regattas. There are at pres
ent a few men in the University
who have had experience in row
ing. They are R. H. Gaither, '06,
F. Zimmerman, '07, A. B. Cheadle,
'06, E. W. Hope, graduate student,
Several good men were developed
in the practice of last fall. J. E.
Beach, '04, B. Bryan, '06, G. A.
Waring, '04, W. H. Dole, '05, F. H.
Cushman, '05, W. W. Henley, '05,
H. A. Moran, '04, R. B. Moran, '05,
W. J. Morin, '04, and G. A. Tar
bell, '06, showed up in good form.
There is enough material in col
lege at the present time to ensure a
successful regatta in the spring.
