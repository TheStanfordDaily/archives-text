# OUTLOOK IN TENNIS.
## Players Anticipate a Successful Season. â€” Interclass Tournaments Will Be Held. 
### 
The prospects for a Stanford vic
tory in the annual tennis contest
with California are unusually
bright. With one pood court al
ready built, and a probability that
two more will soon be leveled, the
facilities for practice are excellent.
Owing to a lack of available courts
the Stanford teams have always
been severely handicapped in past
years. There is an abundance of
seasoned material in college this
semester, and from among the men
who are practicing daily there is
promise of developing new players
for the future. The tennis squad
will be carefully organized and
strictly conducted this semester.
The men are trying to complete
arrangements whereby they will be
allowed to substitute tennis prac
tice for class work in the gymna
sium.
If the new courts are completed,
interclass tournaments will become
a certainty. C. H. Baker, '04, cap
tain of the tennis squad, and the
executive committee of the Tennis
Club will have charge of this tour
nament, as well as of the try-outs
for the intercollegiate team. It.ie
probable tint the plans hitherto
followed in the try-outs will be ma
terially altered this year.
There are three men in college
who have played on the Varsity
tennis team. F. A. Lei I), '02,
played two years ago, and C. H.
Baker, '04, played in the last two
intercollegiate matches. H. A.
Weilie, '04, Is ineligible on account
of the four-year rule. G. A. llodge,
'06, made the team last year, but
was unable to compete with Cali
fornia on account of illness. Be
sides these men there are several
players who are Varsity possibili
ties.
A committee consisting of A. W.
Hooper, '05, G. A. Hodge, '06, and
A. Ames, '06, will confer with the
Athletic Committee at the meeting
on Saturday in regard to an em
blem for the players who make the
tennis team. Heretofore losing
teams have received no emblem
whatever, and an attempt will be
made to have one granted by the
Athletic Committee, whatever may
be the outcome of the intercollegi
ate match.
