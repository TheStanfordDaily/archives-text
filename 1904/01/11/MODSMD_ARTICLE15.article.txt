Thk fact that Lagunita will be
strengthened so that it can he kept
filled with water throughout the
college year means that hoating, as
a prospective intercollegiate event,
lias received a considerable impe
tus. There are many things that
will always he at work to handicap
the progress of Stanford oarsmen,
but the presence of even a small
sheet of water upon which practice
may be carried on during the entire
year will mean much to the Boat
Club in its praiseworthy efforts to
establish rowing on a permanent
basis. A contest with California
is still but a remote possibility, but
any step towards the introduction
of a clean college sport which will
broaden our athletic relations with
outside colleges should be encour
aged by the active efforts of the
entire student body. Now that
there is a prospect of a good rowing
course and a certainty that a num
ber of good boats will be at hand,
the membership of the Boat Club
should be increased in a manner
that will be indicative of a healthy
growth of interest on the part of
the student body.
