# Acknowledgment.
## 
### 
On behalf of Mrs. Stillman and
myself, I wish to take this method
of expressing to the members of
our University community —fac-
ulty and students and other
friends — our gratitude for their
many expressions of sympathy and
helpfulness.
Whatever tinman kindness could
do to render our misfortune bear
able has been done by this com
munity, and where personal ac
knowledgments are not possible
we beg that, this public acknowl
edgment will he received instead.
,1. M. Stillman.
