# Fraternity Baseball League.
## 
### 
The different fraternities are
organizing a baseball league, and
in all probability every Greek-letter
society will enter a nine in the
series of games which will be
played to decide the baseball
championship among the fraternity
men. Each fraternity which enters
a team will contribute three dollars,
and with the money collected a cup
will be purchased which will be
given 10 the winning team of the
league. The fraternity winning
the cup will keep possession of the
trophy for one year and have its
name engraved upon it. The cup
will become the permanent proper
ty of any fraternity winning it
three times. The drawings will
take place at once, and the first
game will probably be played next.
Thursday. In order that the
tournament may not drag, a team
losing two games will forfeit its
claim to the cup. The games will
take place both on the college and
faculty diamonds.
