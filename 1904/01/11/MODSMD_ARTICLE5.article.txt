# BAND RESUMES PRACTICE.
## New Men Strengthen Organization Possibility of Trip to Santa Cruz. 
### 
The University Band will resume
regular rehearsals on Thursday
and will continue to meet twice a
week throughout the semester.
Several new men have appeared
who will try for positions this term.
The newcomers are a trap
drummer and a number of horn
men. All of the old players are
back and will continue to partici
pate, so that with the addition of
the new men the band will be very
materially strengthened. A large
amount of new music has arrived
from the East, a majority of the
pieces being concert numbers and
popular airs.
With the purpose of rendering
the band more effective in concert
music, a number of reed
instruments have been added, and
the plan of paying greater atten
tion to classical music has been
formulated.
Negotiations are still under way
with regard to the proposed Santa
Cruz trip. The manager is trying
to make an engagement for the
April vacation, but it is not certain
that arrangements can be com
pleted for a date so early in the
hotel season. The management at
Santa Cruz has offered to engage
the band for the entire summer,
but there is little probability that
such an agreement can be reached,
as the members will be scattered
during the summer vacation.
There is a possibility, however,
that the members may agree to
gather the latter part of August
and play at Santa Cruz for two
weeks before the opening of college
next fall.
