## Rev. J.S. Macintosh of San Francisco Delivered the Morning Sermon. 
### 
At the morning service in Memo
rial Church the sermon was
preached by Rev.'J. S. Macintosh,
I). D., of San Francisco. The min
ister took for his subject "The
Straightforwardness of Jesus
Christ," and chose for his text
John 14:2, "If it w.ere not so I
would have told you." He dwelt
upon honesty, sincerity, simplicity,
and straightforwardness as the
most striking features of Christ's
teachings, and showed how well
they satisfied the present-day pas
sion for clearness of statement and
clean-cut, positive truth.
The tenor of his remarks follows:
There are two kinds of truthfulness
—one which states facts simply,
leaving the individual to judge
concerning them; the other which
gives relations and interpretations
as well as facts. The first is Na
ture, who lays herself open to us.
Truthfulness of the God-horn na
ture, having given the whole truth,
takes especial regard for the inter
pretation of that truth. This su
preme kind of truthfulness is the
safeguard of our souls. "If it were
not so I would have told you." no
matter how sweet the vision, how
agreeable the contemplation, how
checring the hope. In this the in
dividuality and society of a person
are saved, and his companionship
secured. Sometimes one must be
alone and at other times in a
crowd, from the very nature of his
being.
"In my Father's house are many
mansions." There is, then, another
world, and a possibility, even a cer
tainty, of an everlasting growth. If
this be so it is well that we carry
out of the great straightforward
school of Jesus Christ some convic
tion to keep, namely, that Death
does not end all. We realize that
the struggle within us is for the
most splendid aspirations, and that
we are rising in manhood and
womanhood, in fellowship and
sympathy with Jesus Christ.
Following the afternoon service
there was a short devotional ser
vice, which has been arranged for
this semester, and which is intended
to afford an opportunity for discus
sion of general religious topics.
