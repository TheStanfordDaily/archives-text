At a time when the outlook for
developing a strong tennis team is
brighter than it has been for sev
eral years, it is most humiliating
that the tennis players should find
themselves unable to proceed be
cause men have failed to make
good their promises. It is well
enough that a man should be en
thusiastic in fostering a new enter
prise, and the man who promises
to give his financial support to a
laudable student body undertaking
is a good kind of man to have in
college—if he will make his prom
ise good. It has probably been
the history of every popular sub
scription that a percentage of the
pledges have never been fulfilled
by their makers. Let us hope that
the men whose names are still un
cancelled from the tennis subscrip
tion lists will remember that this
indifference on their part is as
much a breach of honor as if they
failed to meet their debts. There
are some individuals who, when
asked to subscribe, are too weak
minded to say "no" even though
they have no intention of ulti
mately satisfying the obligation.
A Stanford man, who is deserving
of the title in its best meaning,
does not belong to this class, but
rather is he numbered among those
who will hasten to repair a fault
that has endured through forget
ful ness alone.
