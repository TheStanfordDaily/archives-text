# Shipment from Stock Farm.
## 
### 
A consignment of twenty-four
horses was sent from the Stock
Farm to San Francisco yesterday
afternoon to be put on sale at
auction Thursday evening at the
salesyard of F. H. Chase & Co.
The shipment included seventeen
yearlings, several fillies, and three
brood mares. Of the latter, Marion,
2:26f, and Sonoma, 2:28, are ex
pected to bring a high figure.
The string of horses recently sent
to New York from the Stock Farm
arrived sixty hours late and
had to be sold at special auction,
which caused a material reduction
in the profits.
