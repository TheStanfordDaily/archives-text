Editor Daily Palo Alto:
At the close of last semester a
committee was appointed l»y the
Executive Committee of the Asso
ciated Students to secure subscrip
tions toward covering the deficit
incurred in building the new
asphalt tennis court. The com
mittee performed its work and a
sustantial subscription list was
secured in the Hall and among the
fraternities. Upon the showing
that the subscription committee
made, the Executive Committee
consented to give two additional
courts in order that the develop
ment of a good tennis team would
not be handicapped through lack
of facilities for practice. The Exec
utive Committee took this action
on the understanding that the
money would be paid by the first
of the present semester. In many
instances men have been entirely
indifferent about paying the money
that they had previously sub
scribed. The Committee earnestly
requests that all who can possibly
do so will turn in their subscrip
tions before the meeting of the
Executive Committee on Wednes
day. L. H. Roskbkrry,
