# INTERFRATENITY BASEBALL.
## Twelve Teams Are Entered in Contest for the Silver Cup. 
### 
Representatives from most of the
Greek-letter societies met last eve
ning at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house and completed arrangements
for the interfraternity baseball
series. Twelve fraternities will
enter the tournament, and dates for
games have already been arranged
for them. Any fraternity which
does not enter the league this sea
son will be barred from participa
tion in subsequent series which
will be held to decide the perma
nent possession of the trophy
purchased this year. The cup,
which will cost about thirty-five
dollars, will be purchased as soon
as possible. A set of agreements
was drawn up, in which it was
decided that any member of a fra
ternity, or any pledged man who
is registered in college and lives in
the house, is eligible to play. All
games must be played as scheduled
unless postponed by consent of
both teams, but under no circum
stances may the postponement be
for a longer period than three days
after the scheduled date.
In order that the series may be
finished quickly, a team, when
defeated twice, will be dropped
from the list of contestants. The
winning team will have its name
engraved upon the cup and retain
possession of the trophy for one
year. The fraternity winning the
cup three times will become its
permanent owner.
An executive committee com
posed of the captains of the teams
will transact all the business in
connection with the league. E. A.
Luce, '04, was elected treasurer,
and W. H. Blake, '04, official
scorer. An umpire will be select
ed soon, and the first game
will be played next Thursday on
the Varsity diamond. The sched
ule of games follows:
Thursday — Theta Delta Chi vs.
Phi Delta Theta.
Friday — Sigma Nu vs. Kappa
Sigma.
Saturday — Delta Tau Delta vs.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Monday — Phi Kappa Psi vs. Phi
Gamma Delta.
