# MUSICAL CLUBS RETURN.
## Small Houses in a Number of Towns Will Result in a Large Deficit. 
### 
Twenty-one members of the
Combined (J lee and Mandolin
Clubs, accompanied by Treasurer
Cowden, returned from the north
ern concert tour today. They
arrived at San Francisco from Port
Townsend on the steamer City of
Pueblo this morning and a major
ity came directly on to the Univer
sity. The five other men who
made the northern trip decided to
return from Port Townsend by
rail, and are due at any time.
Socially the trip was a pleasant
one, hut financially it was not a
success. In a number of cases,
owing to unfortunate conditions,
the houses were sometimes poor
where the best attendance had
been expected, and this resulted in
a deficit which will exceed the per
sonal deposits of the men by $500.
The total will he about $1000.
On the way north the first con
certs were given at Stockton,
Sacramento, Chico and Redding.
The houses in these places were
good, and the people did every
thing to entertain the clubmen. At
Sacramento, Stockton, and Red
ding dances were given after the
concert, and at Chico the men were
guests at a private house. Mis
fortunes began as soon as the men
crossed the Oregon line. The train
was five hours late at Ashland,
and as a consequence the clubs lost
half their audience. The next con
cert was at Eugene, Oregon, on
Christmas Day. The house here
was not so good as expected, the
concert having the unusual compe
tition of a large fashionable wed
ding. In the afternoon the men
were entertained at the University
of Oregon, and in the evening there
was an enjoyable smoker at the
residence of Professor Clenn. The
president of the university and a
number of prominent men were
present, and the evening was very
pleasantly spent. At Salem there
was a good house.
The next stop was at Portland
where the clubs met with a very
good reception. Besides having a
large and appreciative audience at
their concert, the men were enter
tained. They were made guests
of Professor Hill's Military Acad
emy and remained there for four
days while they gave concerts at
some neighboring towns.
On the Saturday afternoon after
Christinas there was a big reception
at Bishop Scott's Academy, and in
the evening the men were guests at
a smoker at the University Club.
On Saturday night, December 27th,
a dinner was given in honor of the
clubmen, at which a number of
prominent old Stanford men were
present, including Ralph S. Fisher,
ex-'02, E. W. Morgan, ex-'Ol, Hugh
Boyd, '00, F. B. Reilly, '00, and C.
G. Murphy, '01.
From Oregon the clubs went on
to Washington, where a concert
was given at Tacoma. There was
a fair house her.e. After the con
cert three dances were given in
honor of the men, who distributed
themselves among the various
