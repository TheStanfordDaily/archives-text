# California Notes.
## 
### 
—At a meeting of the student
executive committee of the Univer
sity of California last night, it was
decided to hold track meets with
Pomona College and the Univer
sity of Nevada. Pomona also asked
for a football game next fall.
— Registration for the spring
semester at the University of Cali
fornia is nearly complete. Nine
teen hundred and thirty-three stu
dents have enrolled, while last year
at this time nineteen hundred and
forty-seven had registered for work.
—A challenge has been received
by President Wheeler from Patrick
O'Dea, athletic manager of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, for an inter
collegiate boat-race, to take place
at Madison, Wisconsin, in June.
Many universities have been invited
by Wisconsin to take part in this
regatta, which will be one of the
events of the jubilee celebration in
commemoration of the fiftieth anni
versary of the founding of the uni
versity.
■ —i-The outlook for a strong base
ball team at California is consid
ered good. Seven of last year's
players who have returned to col
lege will try for places this season.
There is a possibility that Captain
Overall may leave college before
the baseball season, and in this
case Heitmuller, who played center
field last year, would be called

upon to do the pitching. In addi
tion to the veterans of last year's
winning team several new men of
promise have registered at Cali
fornia.
—It is almost a certainty that
the University of California will
have an exhibit at the St. Louis
Exposition. A location lias heen
offered the University in the vesti
bule of the Educational building.
This position is immediately in
front of the California State Edu
cational exhibit and near the col
lege exhibits of Harvard, Michigan,
Wisconsin, the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, and close
to the displays of the agricultural
colleges and the United States Ag
ricultural Experiment stations.
The only thing which makes the
display uncertain is the need of
funds to transport and maintain
the exhibit. The amount necessary
for this is $5000, and steps are now
being taken to raise this sum.
—The building and grounds
committee of the bonrd of regents
is considering plans made by Ar
chitect John Galen Howard for an
immense amphitheater, on the plan
of the Harvard Stadium. The cost
of merely excavating and refilling
of the earth would be over $40,000.
The amphitheater will include a
football field and a baseball dia
mond. A cinder-path can be
placed around its outside edge.
The plan calls for temporary
wooden bleachers, in place of the
concrete sents. The site for the am
phitheater is on the broad field
south of the old campus. As the
building of California Hall will en
croach on the present baseball dia
mond, it is probable that the plans
of Architect Howard may be car
ried through.
