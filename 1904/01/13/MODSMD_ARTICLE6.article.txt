## Charles Doyle of the Sacramento Team Engaged to Lead Squad. 
### 
Charles Doyle, former pitcher
and center-fielder on the Sacra
mento team of the Pacific Coast
League, has been secured as base
ball coach for the present season.
Negotiations have been carried on
by Treasurer Cowden with Doyle
for some weeks, but it waß not
until this afternoon that filial ar
rangements were made. In his
telegram of acceptance Doyle stated
that he would leave San Diego
today for the University. He is
due to arrive tomorrow, and will
take up his work at once.
Doyle is considered one of the
best all-round players on the Coast.
As a pitcher be lias good curves
and speed, and he uses his head to
the best advantage. In the field
he has acquitted himself with equal
credit, and as a batter there are but
few heavier hitters in the Pacific
Coast League. He is a general
utility man. He understands the
game in all its points, and is very
quick to discover the weaknesses of
those under his eye, whether in
pitching, batting, or fielding. He
is a man of energy and action, and
is expected to keep the men up to
the rules of practice and training.
The return of Treasurer Cowden
and the engagement of Doyle as
coach mark the beginning of the
earnest work of the season. Ar
rangements have already been
made for the scraping of the dia
mond tomorrow morning so that
the ground may be in the best
shape. Captain Ball has issued a
call to all candidates for the team
to appear for the initial practice
tomorrow afternoon at 4:15. Prac
tice will be held daily thereafter.
