# HANDBALL TOURNAMENT.
## Preparations for Play Mark Revival in this Sport at Stanford. 
### 
The large entry lint for the hand
hall tournament, which will he
started on the gymnasium courts
next Saturday, is an indication of
the revival of interest in the game
that has taken place at Stanford
this year. The interclass doubles,
which will he played first, will
serve mainly as practice matches
for the championship singles, which
determine the identity of the holder
of the gymnasium belt.
Three years ago the gymnasium
offered a silver-mounted, carved
leather belt to the winner of the
handball singles. W. F. Dunn,
'04, is the only player who has won
the trophy, he having out-pointed
all rivals during the last three
years. This year, however, Dunn
is not registered for gymnasium
work, and this fact renders him in
eligible to play. At present S. P.
Frisßelle, '04, seems to stand the
best chance of winning the cham
pionship, but a number of new
players may upset calculations.
The question of making handball
an intercollegiate event was agi
tated somejtime ago, but latelyjhoth
California and Stanford seem to
have lost interest in the project.
This fact is probably due to a lack
of suitable courts, both at Califor
nia and at Stanford. Those in En
cina gymnasium are neither ade
quate nor of the regulation size, the
only regulation court near Stan
ford being at San Mateo.
Last spring Dunn, '04, and Fris
selle, '04, defeated the California
players in a match which was
played on the Olympic Club courts
in San Francisco. It is very prob
ablejjthat this informal contest be
tween the representatives of Stan
ford and California will he repeated
next spring.
The time of entry in the coming
tournament has been left open to
allow the members of the musical
clubs, who have just returned to
the campus, to take part in the
contest. The officials and drawings
will be announced before the tour
nament begins.
