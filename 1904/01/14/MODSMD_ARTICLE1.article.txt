# INTERCLASS DEBATE.
## The 						Sixth Annual Contest Between Sophomores and Freshmen Will Take Place Friday. 
### 
From the standpoint of local in
terest and display of class spirit
the sixth annual interclass debate
in the chapel tomorrow evening
will be the most attractive debat
ing contest that will take place on
the campus this semester. Both
teams have spent several weeks in
preparation for the event and a
thorough discussion of the question
is expected. The subject for debate
is, "Resolved, That present condi
tions justify the admission of New
Mexico and Arizona as states into
the Union." The Freshmen will
attempt to show that these terri
tories deserve statehood, while the
Sophomore speakers will support
the negative position. The subject,
which is one of national interest,
formed the basis of a plank in the
party platforms during the last
presidential campaign.
The speakers for the Freshman
class are J. M. Close, J. E. Steph
ens, and J. E. Gates. All three
were members of the Freshman de
bating society last semester, and
had experience in debating before
coming to college. Stephens was
recently elected to membership in
Euphronia.
The Sophomore team has had a
slight advantage in experience. E.
A. Cunha and J. L. Maloy were
members of the Freshman team
that was defeated last year by the
1905 class team. 1). I). Sales has
had experience in the work of his
literary society. The three Soph
omore contestants are members of
Euphronia.
0. C. Spencer, '04, president of
the Intersociety Debating League,
will preside over the contest, and
J. T. Burcham, instructor in law,
L. E. Bassett, instructor in elocu
tion, and M. G. Dodge, associate
librarian, will act as judges. The
debate will begin promptly at 8.
