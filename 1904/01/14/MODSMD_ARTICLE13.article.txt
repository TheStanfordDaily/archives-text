The fact that hut five candidates
are entered in the competition for
places on the Carnot team would
seem to indicate that interest in
debating has fallen off very mater
ially, within the last year. Debat
ing has never received the support
or elicited the interest that other
college activities call forth, and
because of this the incentive to a
man to enter the field is not so
great as that which calls him to
athletics. But in the past there
has always been a number of
students interested in debating,
among whom competition and
rivalry has been keen. The unus
ual fact that but five men are
entered for Carnot try-outs is not
doe, we believe, to the causes that
make debating less generally inter
esting. It is due to the fact that
last year's veteran team is expected
to be again successful in the try
outs, and for this reason the men
who might represent Stanford next
year are losing a valuable training
and a doubly valuable experience
because they appear to have but
small chance of making a place on
the team this year. If this is the
true explanation of the existing
state of facts it is to be deplored.
In football season the virtues of the
second team man are always kindly
remembered, not with a feeling of
pity because he was a second-class
player, but with a feeling of love
because he tried his hardest and
did his best for his college. The
same spirit should govern in
other things, debating as well as
football. It is too late for anyone
who is not already entered, to par
cipate in the Carnot try-outs, but
if any man stayed out of the con
test because he was afraid of being
beaten, he can not but think of this
step as a loss to him in individual
training and a loss to his college
in that he has sacrificed a chance
to improve and develop himself.
