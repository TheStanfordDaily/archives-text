# " Alumnus " Is Out
## 
### 
The first issue of the Alumnus
for the semester came out today.
The front page is devoted to a com
prehensive review of the thirteen
years of football at California and
Stanford by Archie Rice, '95. A
list of those who were granted de
grees last Friday is published, and
the news of the week is briefly sum
marized. In the editorial column
the proposition of changing the
Alumnus to a monthly or bi
monthly is discussed at some
length.
