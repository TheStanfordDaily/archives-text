# TWO NEW TENNIS COURTS.
## Executive Committee Authorizes the Treasurer to Have Work Rushed. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students decided at its
meeting last night to authorize the
immediate construction of two new
tennis courts, so that the tennis
players of the University may have
better facilities for practice in con
nection with the intercollegiate
contests. Treasurer Cowden was
instructed to have the work begun
as soon as possible and pushed to
completion, and the courts will
probably be ready for use within a
month. The courts, which will be
laid beside the big asphalt court in
front of Encina Hall, will be of a
kind which has been found pecul
iarly suited to the soil of this val
ley. They will have a bed of clay,
which is well oiled and then
sanded. Another coat of oil is then
applied, and this again is sanded.
When evaporation of the oil has
taken place a surface is left which
is practically sand and asphalt,
and which is equal if not superior
to the regular asphalt court. It
maintains a smooth, hard surface
which sheds water readily, so that
rain causes little inconvenience.
The cost of the two courts is esti
mated at about $175. Some time
ago, when the tennis ciub first
asked for more courts, the Execu
tive Committee promised an appro
priation if the club would under
take to raise $288 to cover the
deficit on the cost of the court built
last year. The club undertook to
do this, but found the task impos
sible. F. A. Leib, '02, and B. S.
Allen, '06, representing the club,
reported last night that they had
secured about $125 in cash and
held promises, the value of which
is problematical, for $60 more.
The Executive Committee re
garded the construction of the
courts as essential to the success of
the tennis men in their annual
contests, and decided, therefore, to
have the student body treasurer go
ahead with them at once.
The Executive Committee elected
E. Y. Pomeroy, '05, a member of
the Students' Guild hoard of di
rectors to succeed H. P. Kuhn, '04,
who left college in December. The
election of a president of the Guild
lies with the directors, who choose
one of their own members.
