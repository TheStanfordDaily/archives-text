# VALUABLE BOOKS RECEIVED.
## Mrs. Stanford Presents Rare Collection of Mexican Antiquities to University. 
### 
The University lias received a
set uf Kingsborough's Mexican an
tiquities, a very rare collection, the
gift of Mrs. Stanford. The set
comprises nine large volumes, 22
l>y lli inches in size. The books
were originally presented to Mrs.
Stanford by the Due de Lubat, a
French nobleman who devoted bis
entire fortune to the furtherance of
American archeology.
Hut one edition of these books
was ever published. This ap
peared in London in 1830, at which
time copies were sold for £175.
Owing to the small number of cop
ies that can be found today the
book has increased enormously in
value.
Lord Kingsborough's collection
comprises fac-similee of ancient
Mexican paintings, hieroglyphics,
and other records together with in
terpretations translated from Span
ish, French, and Italian investiga
tors. The book gives a complete
view of many of the old Aztec man
uscripts, together with such inter
pretations as exist. The drawings
of Castenedo relating to Central
America, the Commentaries of Du
paix, and a great many important
codices are given in full. Full ac
counts of the sources of the con
quest of Mexico and of the social,
religious, and political status of
the people, before and after the fall
of the Aztec nation, are given from
direct interpretations of Mexican
codices.
Fac-similes and full translations
are given of the three principal
manuscripts which were saved
from the great mass destroyed by
the Spanish conquerers, namely,
the Mendoxa Code, the Falleriano
llemensis, and the Vatican manu
script No. 3738. The Spaniards
burned all the records that they
could find, for fear they might at
some time reawaken a spirit of un
rest in the Aztecs, but the records
which survive give accounts of the
civilization attained by the ancient
Mexicans. In some respects they
are shown to have been superior to
the Spaniards themselves in intel
lectual advancement, particularly
in the sciences.
The Codex of Sahagun is devoted
to the mythology and the ritual, to
the forms of prayer and the de
grading superstitions of the Aztecs.
The drift of speculation adopted by
Lord Kingsborough in his compila
tion is to establish the theory of
the colonization of Mexico by the
Israelites. With this in view hie
roglyphics are deciphered, manu
scripts com pared, and monuments
delineated.
The author seeks to show the
knowledge of the scriptures
possessed by the latter, and to
identify their torquamadan
records of the deluge and
of the visit of the Messiah
with those of Hebrew ac
counts. The divine book of the
Aztecs, in which are accounts of
the migrations of the nation from
Asia, is reproduced in part in the
Kingßborough collection. This col
lection is valuable as a source of

reference and research into the
ancient history of the Aztec nation.
The addition of thin collection
makes the Stanford books on the
subject complete as any in the
