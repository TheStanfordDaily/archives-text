# Textile Room at Museum.

### 
The exhibition of textiles at the
Stanford Museum has been gath
ered into a new department and
room L has been utilized for the
display. The central feature of
the department is a pair of hang
ings, elaborately embroidered in
purple, gold, and silver. In floor
cases are other hangings of the
same size, but differing in texture,
design, and coloration. All are of
Oriental manufacture.
With this collection of draperies
there arrived a number of beauti
fully executed pillow covers and
head-dresses. One art-piece in par
ticular, of hand-woven gold and
silver tapestry, combined with con
ventional flowers in solid colors, is
a striking example of the effect ob
tained by the use of heavy colors
in the hands of the Turkish artists.
Another piece, of entirely different
design and color scheme, involving
a running scroll, is woven in gold,
green, and scarlet. Fifteen doilies
of drawn and embroidered work,
executed by the refugee women in
the Macedonian mountains, are
also part of the Turkish exhibit, as
well hs other specimens of inter
woven gold and colored thread gar
ments and turbans.
To the Italian exhibit there have
been added four embroidered stoles,
once the property of a Roman Car
dinal. These pieces date back to
the Renaissance period, and are
probably more than three hundred
years old.
