# Changes in Machinery.
## 
### 
During the hint few weeks several
changes have been made in tlie
machinery used hy the Manual
Training department. The large
planer which was formerly sta
tioned on the main floor of the
wood working shop, has been re
moved to the Mechanical Engineer
ing department, in the room below,
where it will be used by the class
in Pattern-making. The pattern
lathe which was used by the Man
ual Training class has also been
turned over to the class in Pattern
making. This machinery, which
was too heavy for use by the Wood
working class, will be replaced by
lighter apparatus in the near
future.
