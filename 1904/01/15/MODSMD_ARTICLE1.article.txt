# STAND TAKEN BY ATHLETES.
## Preparatory School Sweaters Must Not Be Worn on Campus.â€”Upperclassmen Will Enforce. 
### 
At the last meeting of the Ath
letic Committee action was taken
to prevent the promiscuous wear
ing of preparatory school sweaters
and jerseys decorated with the
school emblems. They consid
ered that it detracted from the
dignity of the Stanford Var
sity letter that it should appear as
the companion of a high school or
preparatory school symbol.
Owing the frequency with which
high school sweaters were worn on
the campus last semester the Ath
letic Committee adopted the follow
ing resolution:
Resolved, That it is contrary to
the sentiment of the student body
and contrary to the proper observ
ance of the meaning of a Varsity
emblem that men who have not
earned the Varsity symbol at
Stanford weaT in public the em
blem of any preparatory school;
That this resolution does not
apply to a man who has won the
varsity emblem at any college or
university of an equalstanding with
Stanford;
That the upper-classmen of the
University shall insist that the
spirit and letter of these resolutions
be stringently regarded.
Athlktic Committee.
W. R. Hamilton, Secretary.
