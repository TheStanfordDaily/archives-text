Editor Daily Palo Alto:
While from an artistic point of
view the concert of The Pasmores
last evening was one of the best
given at this place during the year,
the small attendance was another
proof of the lamentable lack of in
terest and taste in musical matters
which exists among us. Unless a
concert is heralded weeks before as
an unsurpassed event and thereby
assumes from the beginning the
character of a show, it has no
chances of success here. There was
a time when matters were different
at Stanford. But since no one
seems to feel the present state of
affairs a disgrace to a college com
munity, we advise good artists, such
as we heard last night, to keep
away and leave the field to the
shows. Music-lover.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
