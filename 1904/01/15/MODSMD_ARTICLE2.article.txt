# FIRST BASEBALL PRACTICE.
## Large Number of Candidates Appear for Work on Varsity Diamond. 
### 
Nearly forty men appeared on
the diamond yesterday afternoon
for the first baseball practice of the
season. Among this number were
eight Varsity men, many of the
players on last year's class teams,
and a number of Freshmen.
The men were divided into two
squads: those trying for positions
in the infield, and those trying for
positions in the outfield. Of the
men in the infield Williams, '06,
and Crawford, '04, handled them
selves surprisingly well for the
first practice.
Coach Doyle has not arrived
from San Diego, but is expected
today and will he on the field
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30, when
a line-up will take place and every
man on the squad will be
given a chance at his position. It
is the intention of Captain Hall to
have the class games played as
soon as possible, and after that prac
tice games will take place every
afternoon between the first and
second teams.
The Varsity will start playing
match games with the different
teams in about two weeks. (James
will probably be played with Santa
Clara College, St. Mary's College
of Oakland, and a team composed
of alumni of both Stanford and
California. It is also probable that
Ireland will organize a team simi
lar to the Independents of last
season. These games will lie played
almost entirely on Saturdays in
order that the men will not be
obliged to slight their college work.
Four men will probably try out

for the position of pitcher: Tritch,
'04, of last year's Varsity; Roose
velt, '04, Sales, '06, and Swain, '07.
Tritch pitched good baseball last
year, and has plenty of speed and
a variety of curves, among them
a very effective drop-curve. Roose
velt has speed, but is wild at
times, and is slow at fielding his
position; he hits well. Sales has
good control, speed, and curves, but
lacks experience. Swain is a Fresh
man who entered Christmas with
a good record in his preparatory
school.
Captain Ball, '04, Stott, '07, and
Dawson, '04, will try for the catch
er's position. Ball catches, throws
the bases, and bats well. Stott has
a good preparatory school record.
He caught for the Multnomah
Athletic Club last year.
There are six candidates for first
base; Knight,'o4,Blake, '04, Moore,
'05, Colbert, '06, Howard, '06, and
Matthews, '07. Blake played first
base on the'o2 Varsity, and Knight
right field on the same nine.
Funke, '05, Williams, '06, Wein
mann, '06, Kelly, '07, and Stagner,
'07, will compete for second base.
Williams, of last year's Varsity, is
the most likely man for the place,
but Crawford, '04, is about to leave
college and it is probable that
Williams will be moved to short
stop, the position he played last
year.
Frinke, '04, Williams, '06, and
Crawford, if he returns to college,
are men likely to be seen at the
position of short-stop.
For third base, Ball, '04, Trow
bridge, '05, Hudson, '06, and
Chalmers, '07, will try out. Ball
will probably play third if he does
not catch. Trowbridge played right
field on last year's Varsity.
For the positions in the field
Wirt, '06, Trowbridge, '05, and
Knight, '04, all Varsity men, be
sides a number of new'men, will
contest.
The team and the positions will
take more definite shape after a
few weeks of practice.
