# CARNOT TRY-OUTS TOMORROW.
## Five Candidates from Whom Team to Meet California Will Be Chosen. 
### 
The final try-outs for the selec
tion of the Carnot team will be
held in the chapel tomorrow night
at 7:80. There will be five speak
ersâ€”Frank Roebr, '04, 11. M.
Lewis, '04, 0. H. Hitter, '04, A.
Sheriffs, '05, and A. M. Dibble, '05.
The judges will be Prof. 0. A. Dun
iway of the History department,
M. G. Dodge, associate librarian,
and Dr. R. M. Alden of the Eng
lish department.
While the conditions this year
are not so good as they might be,
there is still every reason to hope
that the Stanford team that is se
lected will make a very good
showing, and the chances of
capturing the medal that was
awarded to a California man
last year are -considered prom
ising. The number of candidates
for a place on the team this year is
smaller than it has been in any
previous contest, but of the five
men three are veterans of last
year's debate and the other two
have had more or less experience.
Roebr, Lewis, and Ritter comprised
the team that met the University
of .California men in last year's
contest; Sheriffs was a member of
the second team, which debated
with the University of Washington
last year; and Dibble made the
finals in the Carnot and was named
as alternate on the last intercolle
giate team. It is expected that the
experience of these men will be of
the greatest value to them. The
try-outs at the University of Cali
fornia have not yet been held, and
it is therefore not known what
men will represent the State Uni
versity.
The question for debate this year
will be some phase of the French
judicial system. According to the
new rules governing the contest,
the specific question will not be
given until two hours before the
meeting, the idea being to force the
men to read widely and then to
test their power to speak extempo
raneously on some specific phase of
the general question.
The special handicap of the
Stanford men is in the matter of
books. The material available
upon the French judicial system is
not very extensive, nor is it of the
best kind. In addition, much of it
is written in French, which com
pels the men to work very slowly
by themselves or with the aid of a
translator. Assistant Professor
Searles of the Department of Ro
manic Languages is devoting con
siderable time in an effort to aid
the men in this way. This handi
cap is a serious one in the case of
those men who are entirely unfa
miliar with the language, since
they are unable to get first-hand at
the direct French literature on the
subject of the judicial system of the
republic.
The debate this year will be held
in Harmon Gymnasium, at the
University of California. It was
held in Assembly Hall at Stanford
last year, when the medal was won
by Max Thelan of the University
of California.
