### 
The second in the series of cham
ber concerts will be given on the
evening of January 29th in Assem
bly Hall. It is proposed to select
the music in such a way that the
course of three concerts will give a
rapid survey of the development of
composition of chamber concert
music. In accordance with this
plan the two main selections for
the next concert will be from the
earlier period. They will be a
quartet by Hadyn, "The Lark,"
and one by Mendelssohn, Opus 44,
No. 3. The program will be light
ened by several numbers â€”one by
Baceherini, and two new waltzes
by Dvorak which were given to the
leader of the quartet, Henzel Kopta,
by the composer himself. They
will be played from manuscript.
The soloist will be Mrs. Edward
F. Schneider of Oakland, who is
well known to musical people of
the Pacific Coast. At present, be
sides doing -work in private in
struction, she is head of the vocal
conservatory at Mills College.
The committee is very anxious
to have the subscriptions redeemed
as soon as the convenience of the
subscribers will permit. In this
way more definite action in regard
to offering better entertainments
can be taken. The committee has
several very attractive things in
case it can be assured of the neces
sary financial support.
