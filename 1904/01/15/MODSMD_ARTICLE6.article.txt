The play, " David Garrick,"
which is to be presented by the
Sophomore class on the evening of
January 22d, in Assembly Hall, is
one of the best of modern comedies.
It was written by J. W. Robertson.
Though n comedy, it is marked
throughout by simplicity and sin
cerity in which there is no strain
ing for effect.
There are eleven characters in
the play—eight male and three
female —and every part offers good
opportunity for the ambitious
actor. Mr. Southern, as early as
18G4, acted the part of Garrick. at
the Haymarket Theater, London.
He has appeared, since that time, in
the chief cities of England and
the United States, and always has
met with marked success. The
play bus also been most success
fully presented by E. S. Willard
and Nat Goodwin. There are many
difficulties in connection with the
production of such a play, but
these are not so great as to dis
courage the amateur actor who is
willing to work.
The parts have been carefully
studied and faithfully rehearsed
since early in November by those
who are to appear in them next
Friday night. The production
promises to be one of the most in
teresting and artistic of the year.
