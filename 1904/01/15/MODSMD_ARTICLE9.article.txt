The resolutions in regard to the
wearing of preparatory school
sweaters, adopted at the last meet
ing of the Athletic Committee,
should he regarded by every upper
classman in college as of vital im
portance. Stanford is remarkable
for its absence of class distinctions,
due to its wide elective system and
the abolition of class rushes, and
for the freedom that is granted
everyone, senior or freshman, to do
or say whatever he likes. To a cer
tain extent such a state of affairs
is praiseworthy, but only as long
as the under-classman is governed
by a sense of respect for unwritten
laws and unspoken traditions. It
was apparent last semester that
the freshman did not become im
bued with such feelings. The
sweater of the most unimportant
high school was worn on the quad
as proudly as though it represented
months of work and training on
our own athletic fields. While
such action was intolerable, it was
nevertheless allowed in a charac
teristic manner. But at last the
Athletic Committee has been
roused to action, and has taken a
stand in which it should receive
the support of,'every upper-classman
in the University. If a sense of the
fitness of things will not prompt
a man to conform to a recognized
college custom, he should be hand
led with ungloved hands in forc
ing upon his understanding the
necessity of doing as older and
more experienced men demand. A
mere statement of the position of
the athletes of the college should be
enough to work the permanent ban
ishment of the preparatory school
sweater; fif this proves to he not
enough other means to carry the
resolution into effect will be under
taken.
