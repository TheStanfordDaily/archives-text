# CARNOT TEAM CHOSEN.
## Men Who Will Represent Stanford in Intercollegiate Debate Selected. 
### 
Howard M. Lewis, '04, Frank
ltoebr, '04, and Alexander Sheriffs,
'05, are the men who were chosen 1
as the team which will represent
Stanford in the tenth annual Car
not debate with the University of
California. The final try-out, held
in the chapel Saturday night, was
one of the finest preliminary
debates that has taken place at
Stanford. There were five men
only in the finals, the preliminaries
having been dispensed with entirely
on account of the small number of
entries. The rules of the contest
stated that two hours before the
time of the debate the exact ques
tion would he announced. The
contestants were ready at six and
received the question from the
committee. The wording of the
question was: "Resolved, That the
ordinary, civil, and judicial courts
of France should be given complete
jurisdiction over the acts of admin
istrative officers and private indi
viduals."
Lewis, Sheriffs, and Dibble spoke
for the affirmative, while Hitter and
Roehr upheld the negative. The
men were allowed fifteen minutes
each and divided their time as they
wished, each man being allowed to
speak twice. Lewis opened the
debate with a logical speech in
which he reviewed the judicial
system of France. During both
speeches he insisted on one main
point and was satisfied with prov
ing this. Hitter was the second to
speak. He was less fluent than
Lewis, but made up for this by
presenting his case clearly, and by
cleverly refuting the arguments of
his adversary. The third speaker
of the evening was Sheriffs. He
made a wonderfully forceful speech
and carried off the palm for lucid
ity of argument and ease of presen
tation. Roehr was the other
speaker for the negative. In a
clear-cut, logical address, he made
certain his position on the team.
Dibble spoke in the affirmative.
His rebuttal was particularly
strong, and the general impression
he created was favorable.
The judges were forced to delib
erate for some time before announc
ing their decision. No alternate
was chosen. Lewis and Roehr were
members of last year's Carnot and
Intercollegiate teams. The three
members of the team are students
in the department of Law; Lewis
and ltoebr are Seniors, and Sheriffs
is a Junior. He was a member of
last year's Washington team.
Sheriffs and lloehr are both from
San Jose, and while under-classmen
belonged to the San Jose Debating
Society Both are members of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity. Lewis
registers fr<>m Palo Alto, is a mem
ber of Fuphronia, and of the Delta
Upsilon fraternity.
The OariV't debate will be held
in Harmon gymnasium at Berkeley
on Fehrll irv H'h.
