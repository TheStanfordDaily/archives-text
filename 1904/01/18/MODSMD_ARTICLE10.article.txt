The Sunday sermon in Memorial
Church was delivered hy lit. llev.
\V. F. Nichols, Bishop of California,
llev. Nichols took for his text,
Malachi, iv 2, "But unto you that
fear my name shall the Sun of
Righteousness arise with healing
in his wings. 1 ' He compared the
munificence of God to the rays of
the sun at davhreak, and spoke of
the fact that in the sun theie is
healing power as well as warmth
and light. He compared this
power of the sun to the Gospel of
Christ, which gives the warmth in
creed, the light in code of conduct,
and the healing in the power
which accompanies a true concep
tion of the Gospel.
The fact that really dominates
mankind is conscience. In the
specialization of ethics, to say
nothing of religion, it is a more
complete element than it was cen
turies ago. Associated with the
ethics and theories of today, we
must he more alurt than ever to
safeguard it, and the only way to
protect it is by the application of
this power of the Gospel.
