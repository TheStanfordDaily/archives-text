The debates of Friday and Sat
urday night are encouraging in
spite of the fact that the number of
men entered in the Carnot try-out
was unusually small. The men
who competed in the Carnot finals
acquitted themselves creditably
and showed the result of hard
study in the masterful manner in
which they handled a difficult
question. There are in college a
number of veteran debaters who
should be well able to care for the
intercollegiate debating events of
the present year. In addition, the
interclass debates have aided in
the development of a second rank
of speakers who will be admirably
equipped to take the places that
the present seniors will leave va
cant by graduation.
