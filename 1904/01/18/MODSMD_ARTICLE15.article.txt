We wish to call the attention of
the student body to the necessity
of keeping off the baseball diamond
when it is wet. Already the field,
which was leveled but recently,
has been so tracked that it is al
most valueless as a practice ground.
Every year the efforts of the man
agement to keep the grounds in
condition have been severely handi
capped by indifference or thought
lessness on the part of those men
who walk across the muddy field in
order to save a few steps. Men
who go from the quad to the gym
nasium are the principal offenders
in this respect,but a word of warn
ing should be sufficient to put a
stop to this practice.
