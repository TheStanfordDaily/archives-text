Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The communication printed in
the Daily Palo Alto of Jan. 15th
in regard to the treasurer of the
Students' Guild having authorized
the Pasmore concert to he given as
a Guild benefit was a mistake, but
I now think that the "Manager for
The Pasmores" was bona fide in
making the statement.
A few days before the play, a
man, whom I have found since to
be the "Manager for the Pasmores,"
came to me and stated that the
Pasmores intended to give a play,
and that twenty per cent, of the
profits were to go to the Guild. I
expressed my desire that the play
would be a success. It did notoccur
to me that there was any intention
on the part of the manager to
advertise the play as a Guild
benefit. A subsequent talk with
the manager, however, has led me
to believe that he thought he had
gained my consent to advertise the
concert as given under the auspices
of the Students' Guild. He also
thought that my consent gave him
sufficient authority to do such
advertising.
Mr. H. B. Pasmore has written
his regret about the misunderstand
ing, stating that he was quite sure
his manager had gained consent
from the proper authorities. I now
believe both The Pasmores and the
manager thought they were doing
nothing unauthorized when they
advertised the concert as given for
the benefit of the Guild.
This communication has not been
authorized bv the Guild. It is made
not as treasurer of the Guild, but
in my individual capacity.
