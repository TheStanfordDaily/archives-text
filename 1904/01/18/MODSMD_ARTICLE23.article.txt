# Track Notes.
## 
### 
—The recent rain will not inter
fere materially with the training of
the track candidates. The new run
ways drained perfectly and can be
need at once. The track is still
soft, but a few hours of sunshine
will put it in better shape.than it
was before the storm.
—Treasurer Cowden has decided
not to engage a professional rubber
for the track squad during the
present season. If convenient
hours can be arranged student rub
bers will be employed. The use of
Student rubbers is not an innova
tion, as their employment during
the football season proved very
successful.
— Every day witnesses additions
to the track squad, although a nja
jority of the aspirants have been
out for the track team before.
Trainer Moulton expresses him
self as disappointed because more
Freshmen are not trying out.
— With the material now in
sight the trainer is confident that
he can turn out a good team, but
unless some of the candidates show
unexpected form, the Varsity will
be very weak in sprints, the hur
dles, and the half-mile run.
—Although training rules are
not in force, most of the candidates

are training as faithfully asthough
the regulations were already in
operation. Some of the men will
be in shape to run trials within a
fortnight.
—The trainer has registered
each man's name in a record book,
and by this means he is prepared
to keep an exact account of the in
dividual performances of each can
didate.
—Among the new men that are
showing good form are: Waring,
'04; Wiley,'o4; Freeman,'o6; Ma
loy,'o6; Leonard,'o7; Presley, '07;
MeFarland, '07 ; Blodgett, '07.
