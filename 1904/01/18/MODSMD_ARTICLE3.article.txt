# "SEQUOIA" REVIEWED.
## Professor Newcomer Criticizes the Last Issue of the College Magazine. 
### 
The poem, the essay, and the
story which hold the respective
places of honor in the lust Sequoia
give the number a distinct value.
"Cypress Branches" is a beautiful
elegy, tense with feeling and deli
cate in expression. Not often does
a poem strike more perfectly the
minor key, or have so sad yet rest
ful a key-note as ''When Fields
Turn Green." The essay cn "The
Influence of the College Fraternity"
is a prize essay, reprinted from the
Alpha Tan Omega Palm. It is
packed with ideas, and generally
with good sense, hut contains some
exaggerations, as .might he expected
of a piece of special pleading. The
humorous contrasts of character in
Mr. Coolidge's "Strangers in Illi
nois" make it a thoroughly delight
ful sketch. Antone is a very good
Catholic to chew his tobacco when
lie "no lahk heem thaht way" for
courtesy's sake. The Sequoia would
take a commendable stand if it
would resolutely blue-pencil certain
profane words. Mr. Coolidge's Ari
zonans (if you pleaseâ€”not Arizon
ians) get along without them, and
why should not the Klondiker in
"An Alaskan Bargain"? A writer's
art should lie great enough to
enable 'him to give the desired
effect without offending our ears
with the blunt words. There are
times when profanity in a story
may serve a purpose, as Bret Harte
and Kipling know, but the mere
need of local color cannot excuse it.
