# INTERCLASS DEBATE.
## Sophomores Defeated Freshmen in Sixth Annual Contest on Friday Night. 
### 
In the chapel Friday evening the
Sophomore debaters were victorious
over the Freshmen in the sixth an
nual interclass debate. The second
year men had the advantage in ex
perience and team work, two men
of the team having been members
of last year's Freshman team.
The question was, "Resolved,
That present conditions justify the
admission of New Mexico and Ari
zona into the Union." The Fresh
men supported the affirmative and
the Sophomores the negative.
The debate was opened bv J. M.
Close for the affirmative. He dealt
with the rights of New Mexico and
Arizona to become states and re
viewed the question, pointing out
the strong features in favor of ad
mission. E. A. Cunha spoke first
for the negative. In a well orga
nized speech Cunha showed that
the population of neither New Mex
ico nor Arizona is sufficient to war
rant statehood. For clearness of
presentation and force of argument
Cunha's speech ranked among the
first. J. E. Stephens continued the
affirmative for the Freshmen. His
speech was better in point of argu
ment and delivery than that of
either of his team-mates. His
speaking was characterized partic
ularly by its clearness and simplic
ity. J. L. Maloy, the second
speaker on the negative, presented
a clear and logical case in a decid
edly forceful manner. Maloy put
more vim into his talk than did
any other member of his team.
The affirmative was closed by J.
E. Cates with a plea in favor of
statehood for the territories. D. I).
Sales closed the debate for the nega
tive. Sales' speech was logical and
well delivered. J. E. Stephens
made good use of the remaining
live minutes which were allotted to
the Freshmen for rebuttal.
The judges were out but a few
minutes and decided unanimously
in favor of the negative.
