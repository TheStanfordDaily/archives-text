# SOPHOMORE COMEDY.
## Story of Play Which Will Be Presented in Assembly Hall Friday Night. 
### 
The story of the play is founded
upon a traditionary incident in the
life of the great actor, David Gar
rick. The play is pretty and full
of feeling; it alternates between
humor and pathos. The story is
of a romantic young girl, Ada, who
falls in love with Garrick while he
is acting Shaksperean plays in
Drury Lane Theatre. Her father
finds this out, and is much opposed
to a possible match with a "play
actor." He sends,for Garrick, who
comes to the house of Ingot, the
father, at his request. While wait
ing in the parlor for the appearance
of the unknown author of the re
quest, he almost forgets his sur
roundings in his revery of a girl
whom he has seen in the audience
at his plays, but whose identity he
does not know and cannot discover.
In the midst of his rhaphsody In
got enters, and, after some explana
tions, he offers Garrick any sum of
money if he will leave the stage
and the country. Garrick refuses.
Touched, however, by the father's
anxiety, and having no idea who
the girl is, Garrick promises tocure
her of her romantic folly, and asks
for an invitation to dinner. His
plan is to pretend to lie drunk, and
disgust the girl. He comes to din
ner at the appointed hour, and at
last Ada enters. The dramatic
moment is at hand; they meet,
and Garrick recognizes the girl he
has seen, and with whom he has
fallen in love. But he has given
his word to this same girl's father
that he will cure her of her love for
him.
After this scene complications
and misunderstandings arise and
the situations are full of power and
emotion* In addition to the more
serious action, the situation
abounds with humor, furnished by
a company of Ingot's friends from
the city—"friends who knew me
when I was poor,—very respectable
people,'' who are all unconscious of
the drama that is being enacted in
their midst.
The advance sale of seats began
at 9 this morning. A large number
of tickets have already been sold.
The tickets are on sale at the Book
store on the campus, and at the
Stanford Pharmacy in Palo Alto.
The posters have been put on sale
