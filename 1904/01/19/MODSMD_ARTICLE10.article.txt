# Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
Coach Doyle took charge of the
large squad of players who ap
peared on the diamond last night
for practice. The muddy condition
of the (ield rendered handling of
the hall uncertain, hut a number
of the men showed form that enti
tles them to recognition as Varsity
possihilites. The men were divided
into two squads, those trying for
tiie infield and those trying for the
outfield. Manager Cowden hatted
to the outfield, and Coach Doyle
and Captain Hall to men in the
infield. Every man was given a
chance at hatting practice, Sales
doing the pitching.
