There is every indication that
"David Garrick," which will be
given by the Sophomore class in
Assembly Hall Friday night, will
meet with both artistic and finan
cial success. Whatever the out
come of the play may be the class
deserves encouragement in the plan
that it will carry through. Stan
ford has had too many original
comedies and farces foisted upon
her in the past to be always appre
ciative of the slipshod work of
some of her amateur playwrights.
While good original work is always
to be encouraged, an artistic repro
duction of a first-class play will be
of greater interest and of more
artistic worth than an original pre
sentation of a farce which relies for
success entirely on local situations
and personal hits. At present, the
success of the comedy appears to
be assured ; the student body
should be enthusiastic in support
of a step which promises much for
the future development of Stanford
theatricals.
