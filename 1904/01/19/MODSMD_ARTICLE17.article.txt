# Baseball at California.
## 
### 
Baseball practice will begin at
tlie University of California next
Monday, and in tlin meantime
a coach will be selected to direct the
work. The situation at California
is somewhat unsettled, owing to the
fact that Captain Overall may not
be in college during the entire se
mester. In case he leaves, Heit
muller, who played center field last
year, will he forced to do the pitch
ing.
There are several men who were
on last year's team who may not be
able to play this year. Match, who
caught last year, is now attending
liasting's Law School and may try
out. Ryan, whocaught last season
for the St. Mary's College team,
will probably till his place. Caus
ley, who played third base last year,
will not be in college this semester,
and hi-* place will be a hard one to
fill. Heitmuller is the only varsity
man now trying for the outfield,
but there are a number of candi
dates with good records. 11 end
rick, who played first base last year,
will not return, so that the only
men of last year's team who will
play their old positions are Over
all, pitcher; Bliss, second base; and
Ada ms, short-stop.
