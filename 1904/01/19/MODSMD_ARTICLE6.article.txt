# NO AWARD OF PUNTING CUP.
## Owing to Incomplete Records and Impossibility of Tournament No Winner Announced. 
### 
The cup which was given to Cap
tain Bansbach last spring by the
Quadrangle Club to be awarded to
the bent punter developed during
the season, will not be presented
this year. It has been found neces
sary to hold the cup over until
next season because the captain
and coach do not care to take the
responsibility of awarding it, since
no accurate record of the season's
punting was kept.
M. P. Hyde, '05, W. H. Dole,
'05, and W. K. Sprott, '06, were
the three men whose punting was
the best throughout the season.
Hyde, while he was on the field,
was superior to either of the other
men. Sprott did the most consist
ent punting throughout the year,
including the majority of the pre
liminary games. In the intercol
legiate contest Dole made a better
average than Sprott and increased
his chances for the cup. Lanagan
and Bansbach did not announce
before the season the plan which
would be followed in awarding the
cup, and a punting tournament
after the season closed was impos
sible because Sprott suffered a se
vere injury to his leg in the inter
collegiate game. For these reasons
the cup will not be awarded for
work done last season. Bansbach
will turn it over to Clark, captain
of the 1904 Varsity, who, with the
coach, will decide on a method of
awarding the cup to the best punter
of the season.
Under the conditions of the gift
bv the Quadrangle Club, the man
who wins the cup three times will
become the permanent owner, and
every man who wins the cup for
one year will have his name en
graved upon it.
