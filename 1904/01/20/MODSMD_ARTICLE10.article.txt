The music that is played in the
chamber concerts is of a much
more technical nature than that to
which the average man is accus
tomed, and one who listens to a
concert without previous prepara
tion is apt to come away with a
feeling that he has not understood
what he has heard. There is noth
ing strange in the idea of one pre
paring himself for the enjoyment
of a serious pleasure. It is not
ridiculous for one to read an Eng
lish version of the play before leav
ing for the theater to witness a pro
duction by Bernhardt. In the
University Library there has been
placed a set of books which will
give a clear understanding of the
purposes and aims of the different
composers whose music will be
played in the next concert of the
series. To those who do not pos
sess a thorough knowledge of mu
sic the perusal of these books will
be a great advantage should they
be fortunate enough to hear the
next chamber concert.
