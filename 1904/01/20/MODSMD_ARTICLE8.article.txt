# Oratorical Contest.
## 
### 
College students nil over the
country are becoming interested in
a proposed oratorical contest at the
World's Fair next autumn, which
will determine the championship
among college men of the United
States. Students of the Missouri
State University are perfecting a
plan proposed hy a student in
Kansas University for the creation
of an interstate oratorical league
comprising every state university
in the union.
The plan is to enlist the inter
est, of debaters in every state uni
versity, to organize a local oratori
cal association in each, to divide
the country into several sections,
each comprising half a dozen or
more states, and to hold the final
contest at the World's Fair in St.
Louis. Every institution will hold
a local contest, in which several of
its leading speakers will participate.
The student who wins at his own
college will represent his state in
the section of several states to
which he belongs. The winner of
this contest will be sent to the
World's Fair to represent his sec
tion.
At the final trial the chosen men
will meet upon a rostrum inside
the exposition and engage in a
contest of oratory that will be
unique. The judges will be select
ed from among the most dis
tinguished and representative mm
in America. In rendering judg
ment, thought, composition nod
delivery will be considered 'â€¢ v
three sets of judges, and h yene- -I
average will be taken of t ir
markings. The man who rernive*
the highest average will be declined
