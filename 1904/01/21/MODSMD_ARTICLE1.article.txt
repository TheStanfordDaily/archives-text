# "DAVID GARRICK."
## Synopsis of Play Sophomore Class Will Present in Assembly Hall Friday. 
### 
Final preparations are being
made for the presentation of
"David Garrick," the three-act cos
tume play to be given in Assembly
Hall tomorrow night by the Soph
omore class. The costumes and
scenery will be typical of the per
iod covered by the play, the scenes
being laid in the year 1742.
Dudley Sales, '06, in the title
role gives promise of scoring a suc
cess. Although the part requires a
great deal of work, Sales, in two
months, has mastered most of the
difficulties, and has overcome many
of the faults of an amateur. Ada,
the leading female part, is handled
with great success by Miss Kerr;
the part of Ada gives her ample
opportunity for good work. R. G.
Barnett and D. 11. Wilson carry
the comedy roles well. The rest of
the cast has been carefully selected,
so that the whole play will be artis
tically and very satisfactorily pre
sented.
The sale of seats has been ex
tremely good, a large number hav
ing been sold in Palo Alto in addi
tion to those sold at the Bookstore.
The University Orchestra will play
before the curtain rises and also be
tween acts.
The following is a careful synop
sis of the play:
This comedy is founded upon an
apochryphal anecdote of the great
English actor. Ada Ingot, the
daughter of the famous East Indian
director, having fallen in love with
David Garrick while witnessing
bis performances, her father entices
the player to his house and there
proposes to pay him a large sum
of money to leave the stage, if not
the country. Ingot desires bis
daughter to marry Chivy, a horse
racing, wine-drinking squire, whom
she heartily despises. Garrick
suggests that the merchant extend
to him an invitation to dinner,
promising that he would so behave
as to induce Ada to accept for hus
band the man of Ingot's selection.
After dinner and through the even
ing the actor simulates inebriety
and conducts himself in such a
manner as lo insult the company
and disgust the young lady. After
his retirement, Chivy, besotted with
wine, reveals to Ingot, in the hear
ing of his daughter, that, having
casually met with Garrick later in
the evening, at a Covent Garden
club, the actor had confessed the
trick he had played, and accepted
a challenge to fight a duel with a
buck, who had spoken disrespect
fully of the merchant and of Ada.
Convinced of Garrick's love for her,
Miss Ingot hurries to his lodgings,
at an early hour, to avert the duel,
where she is surprised by the un
expected arrival of her father and
cousin. Garrick appears, and
illustrates the nobility of his true
character to such a degree that the
merchant discards Chivy as son-in
law and entreats the actor to accept
the hand of his daughter, in this
wise verifying the correctness of
his promise that Ada should
marry the man of her father's
choice.
