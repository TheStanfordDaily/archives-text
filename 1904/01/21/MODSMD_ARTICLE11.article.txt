The English Club is performing
a very valuable service to the col
lege by making a collection of doc
uments relative to the early days
at Stanford. These days are still
close to us of the present decade,
and when we can hear from those
who actually saw, it is hard for us
to realize the importance of pre
serving a written account for those
who will come after we have gone.
There has been so much of senti
ment and so much of love connected
with the founding and upbuilding
of this college that we who have
come after everything is secure can
do little less than keep alive the
memories of past days when every
thing was uncertain. The record
will be invaluable in the future, and
tbe English Club is to be congratu
lated on the forethought that
prompted its step.
