Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As a lover of histrionics I rejoice
at the fine ambition displayed by
the Sophomore class in presenting
"David Garrick." Such a play is
worth while, and must interest ev
ery member of the University. In
its order "David Garrick" will
rank with "The Knight of the
Burning Pestle," for it is a stan
dard comedy, full of good fun, giv
ing opportunity for every capacity
of the players. David Garrick is a
star part, and men like Wyndham
and Sot hern choose it constantly
for revival. It is, of course, ambi
tious for amateurs to attempt a
star-part comedy, but youth knows
not failure, and the Sophomore
class invites us to the play.
I was invited to a rehearsal. I
have played in amateur dramatics
for years, but I never saw an ama
teur company in such a tine state
of preparation. The lities were per
fectly memorized, the acting was
good, the tableaux were working
into shape. The spirit of the work
ers was earnest and conscientious.
Dudley Sales as David Garrick
will surprise his friends. He has
the appearance and voice for the
part, and his interpretation will
be good. Chivy, the young squire,
and Mistress Smith, the mother of
seven children, promise good com
edy, and the more serious notes of
Simon ingot, and Ada,his daughter,
are in capable hands. In costume
and behind paint our friends will
better lose their identity in their
parts, and with good dressing and
suitable scenery the performance
should be an artistic success. For
the sake of the honest efforts of the
players, for the benefit of the Soph
omore class, and for the cause of
histrionics in the University —
hear ye this and come attend the
play. 1). C. G.
