# SCHEDULE ARRANGED.
## Manager Cowden Prepares a Tentative List of Baseball Games for Coming Season. 
### 
Ezra Decoto, student body treas
urer of California; Ireland, man
ager of the San Francisco Indepen
dents; and Treasurer Cowden, met
in San Francisco today and ar
ranged a schedule of baseball
games for the corning season. The
dates are not certain in all cases, as
some of the teams with which
games will be played have not
given their consent to the exact
dates, but in all probability the
series will be played on the days
announced.
The intercollegiate games with
California will come one week
apart, the first being played on
April 2d, and the second on the
Saturday following. In event of a
tie the deciding match will take
place on neutral ground two weeks
later, on the 23d. Four games
have been arranged to be played
between Stanford and the Indepen
dents, one of which, that of March
19th, will take place on the Cali
fornia campus. The scheme
which was proposed during the
football season —that the two col
leges exchange campuses for one
game—will be carried into effect
during the baseball season. Cali
fornia will play Santa Clara at
Stanford on the same day. Stan-
old rival, Santa Clara, will
be given three games, which will be
played early in the season. St.
Mary's College in Oakland will
play the first game with Stanford.
It will take place on January 80th,
on the Varsity grounds.
The present schedule may be
very materially changed before the
end of the season, as Santa Clara
has not given her consent to the
games for which she is dated. A
number of mid-week games will be
arranged by Cowden before long.
California will play the same num
ber of games that Stanford does,
with the exception of the game
with St. Mary's college, and the
opponents of the two colleges will
be the same, so that by the time
the intercollegiate series is held a
good comparison of the respective
merits of the two college nines can
be made. A game may be arrang
ed with some team, probably the
Independents, to be played on
Junior Day on the Varsity dia
mond, and in all probability the
Independents will play California
at Herkeley on Charter Day.
The schedule is as follows:
Jan. 30. — Varsity-St. Marys.
Feb. 6. —Varsity-Independents.
Feb. 13.—Varsity-Santa Clara.
Feb. 20. — Varsity-Independents.
Feb. 27. —Varsity-Santa Clara.
Mar. s.—Varsity-Independents.
Mar. 12. —Varsity-Santa Clara.
Mar. 19. —Varsity-Independents,
Mar. 26. —Varsity-Not decided.
Apr. 2.—Varsity-California.
Apr. 9. —Varsity-California.
