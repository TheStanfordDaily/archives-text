The meeting of the Intercollegi
ate Athletic Committee, to lie held
in San Francisco tomorrow, is in a
certain sense the most important
athletic relation between Stanford
and California for the year. It is
in the power of these representatives
to decide whether California and
Stanford will move toward strict
amateurism and hold their games
on college grounds,or whether they
will continue to meet each other on
a San Francisco field. There is
unquestionably a strong sentiment
in the student body in favor of cam
pus games; there is also a strong
doubt of the practicability of adopt
ing them at the present time.
Whatever action the committee
may deem it wise to take, it is to
be hoped that they will strain a
point in bringing the meets to the
college grounds, even if this step
entails for a few years, a financial
sacrifice of some magnitude.
