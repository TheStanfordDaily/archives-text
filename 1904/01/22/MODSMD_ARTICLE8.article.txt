# PROGRESS IN BASEBALL.
## Batting Practice Occupies Attention of Coach Doyle.â€” Fast Freshmen out. 
### 
The feature of the first week of
baseball practice has been the un
usual attention that Doyle has de
voted to batting. Stanford teams
in the past have owed their defeat
to their iliability to hit the ball, and
the coach is determined to conquer
this weakness before anything else
is done. The men have all been
given as much batting practice as
possible, and the coach and captain
have been watching their work
very closely. Last night three
squads were kept at batting, Doyle,
Sales, and Tritch pitching to the
men. The fielding and throwing
to the bases of most of the players
is well up to the standard for the
first week in the season. The
pitchers, however, have been handi
capped by the cold weather, and
have been unable to exert them
selves for fear of lameness in their
arms.
The number of candidates lias
increased since the first day of the
season, but many of the men are
practicing for the games
which are to be played next week.
From the number of men trying
for the Varsity a good second team
can be picked, which will afford
the Varsity valuable practice.
There are many good ball play
ers in the Freshman class, and
several of them are varsity possi
bilities. Swain, captain of the
Freshman team, and Stott, seem to
have a lead over other players, al
though Chalmers, Morrow, Kelly,
and Stagner are showing up well.
The Freshmen will have a stronger
team than is usual for the inter
class series, and it i9 probable that
these games will bring to notice
some players who have not attract
ed the attention of the coach so far.
Several men have come forward
during the last week and displayed
good form in the early practice.
Stott, '07, throws the bases with
speed and accuracy, and catches
well, but is lamentably weak in
batting. Colbert, '06, plays his
position at first base well and is
hitting the ball hard; Swain, '07, at
second base, plays his position,
throws the bases in good form, and
is batting up to the average for the
first week of the season.
Ball, '04, Trowbridge,'os, Tritch,
'04, Williams, '06, and Wirt, '00,
of last year's nine, are playing in
Varsity form and will probably
make the team again this season.
