# Work on Tennis Courts Begun.
## 
### 
Work on the two new tennis
courts in front of Encina Hull wan
begun this morning. Arrange
mentn for the laying of the courts
have been completed with a Palo
Alto contractor, and it is expected
that the work will be completed
within a week or ten days if the
weather remains favorable. The
courts are laid one on each side of
the big asphalt court. They will
be of the regulation size, but in
stead of being asphalt they will be
of a mixture of dirt and sand,
which, when oiled and dried, gives
a very smooth surface. These
courts have been found very suc
cessful about San .lose, and are not
so expensive as the asphalt courts.
