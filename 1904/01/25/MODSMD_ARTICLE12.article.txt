# "DAVID GARRICK."
## Sophomore Class Rendered Comedy with Unqualified Success Lust Friday Night. 
### 
The production of "David Uar
rick" hy the Sophomore class in
Assembly Hall last Friday night
was a credit to amateur theatricals
at Stanford. From an artistic
Standpoint it exceeded the expecta
tions of thot-e directly interested in
it. Those who went to the per
formance doubtful of the ability
of the amateur actors in
college to pi ay the difficult parts in
the comedy, were convinced that
they had attempted nothing they
could not carry out.
The part of Garrick, which gives
many opportunities for skilful
work, was taken hy D. D. Sales.
His interpretation of the scene in
which he feigns drunkenness was
particularly well done. Ada In
got was played by Miss Frances L.
Kerr in a manner that provoked
much favorable comment. 11. G.
Barnett concealed his own identity
in that of Simon Ingot with great
skill. The heavy comedy role fell
to the lot of D. 11. Wilson. Wilson
carried the part with a knowledge
of its possibilities and an ease that
at every point kept the audience in
sympathy with bis work. Miss
Mercedes de Luna carried out her
part with telling effect. Miss Hal
comb, l\ C. Edwards, S. T. Jordan,
and H. Metzler were the other
members of the cast, and their
work in the tableaux was very
effective.
The costumes, which were made
especially for the performance,
were of the time of the colonial per
iod. Special scenery was purchased
in San Francisco, so that the play
was very artistically staged. A
feature of the production was the
University Orchestra, which, under
the leadership of M. H. Thorpe,
'05, gave evidence of the excellence
it has attained
The comedy was a financial suc
cess. The play was piven to raise
money to liquidate a debt incurred
lÂ»y the Sophomore class last spring
in purchasing baseball supplies.
Enough money was made to pay
this debt of $125.00 and leave a
small balance. The cost of presen
tation was very heavy because of
the fact that both costumes and
scenery were made to order.
