The action taken by the Inter
collegiate Athletic Committee at its
recent meeting in San Francisco
is the most encouraging thing that
has taken place in the athletic his
tory of Stanford and California.
There haß heen a tendency on the
part of Eastern cities to find fault
with Western athletics, not because
the teams were not advanced, but
because the spirit of strict amateur
ism was not thoroughly at the root
of the game. Western critics have
been forced to admit the truth of
many of these slurs. But there
has been a tendency to grow away
from professionalism and the un
sportsmanlike things that follow it.
The two California universities
have taken the lead in encouraging
this growth. They have acted with
a purpose, and the very effort
toward self-improvement has re
sulted in the improvement sought
for. Campus games will remove
the last taint that exists in the ath
letic relationship of Stanford and
California. The move is a l»ig step
in the right direction,and the mem
bers of the committee are to be ap
plauded for their discretion. The
time will surely come when Stan
ford and California will he as re
markable exponents of fair play
and intercollegiate courtesy on the
Pacific Coast as Princeton and
Yale are today on the Atlantic,
and the recent action of the comit
tee makes this time seem not very
far distant.
