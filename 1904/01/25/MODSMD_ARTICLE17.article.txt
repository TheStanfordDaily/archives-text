## 
### 
The first number of the Chapar
ral for this semester, which will he
on sale tomorrow, will contain an
unusually good assortment of fun,
much of it directed :it the faculty.
A plan for a Faculty Assembly
speech is given, and a scholarly
edition of Jack and .Jill is produced,
with class comments. Borough,
Buhh, and Oppenheim contribute
successful art work, the three panel
decorations by Borough being es
pecially good. Editorially a decided

protest is registered against the
Freshmen who take rooms off the
campus, and the '05 Quad and
Honor System come in for discus
sion. The verse, of which there is
a good supply, is hy C. S. Thomp
son, '04, R. E. Renaud, '03, and M.
M. Stearns, '06.
