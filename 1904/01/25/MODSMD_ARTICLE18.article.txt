Editor Daily Palo Alto:
A word ought to he said to voice
the wide-spread appreciation felt
hy the University at large for the
highly creditable performance of
"David Garrick" just, given hv the
Sophomore class. The earnestness
with which the undertaking—a dif
ficult one — was carried through
showed itself in the strongly indi
vidualized portrayal of the several
characters, and in the smoothness
and sureness with which the
whole action proceeded.
Not only has 1 he Sophomore class
given us an entertainment that
must be ranked as excellent, judged
hy the hest standard of amateur
dramatic work, hut it has demon
strated that the giving of good
plays well is a thoroughly practical
and attainable, as it has been a
highly desirable ambition. Stan
ford dramatic entertainments can
not help feeling the influence of the
Sophomore comedy. X. Y. Z.
