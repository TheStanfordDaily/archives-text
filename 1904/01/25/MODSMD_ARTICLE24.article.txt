# ANNIVERSARY SERVICES.
## Church in Relation to the University Subject of the Morning Sermon. 
### 
Chaplain Gardner preached in
Memorial Church yesterday at both
the morning and afternoon services.
As the event was the first anniver
sary of the dedication of the
church, he took for his topic the
church and its work in relation to
the University. He reviewed the
position of the church not upon the
basis of work accomplished, but
upon that of the field of opportun
ity that is open.
He said that the building of
Memorial Church has been an ex
periment in two ways. First,
whether at the side of the modern
sciences and new philosophies there
can be taught successfully the
simple faith and doctrines of the
gospel; and second, whether a
strictly non-sectarian church can
be maintained. The position held
by Senator Stanford was that the
University should seek to train the
student not only intellectually and
physically, but morally and spirit
ually as well. The breadth of the
founders is shown in their aim to
have the church as broad as Christ
ianity â€”to receive all sects regard
less of denomination, in the one
all-dominating object. The church
has confined its field to worship
and instruction. Later the work
will be broadened in a number of
ways. The church stands for
prayer, regardless of outward forms
followed by some denominations.
It is not easy to arrange services
and satisfy the varied ideas of
members of the congregation, but
this the church is attempting to
do, with success so far. Schools
can do much for a man, but they
cannot give him the spiritual side.
The object of ethical and religious
instruction is plain. There is need
of religious instruction for moral
and spiritual health.
The character of the pulpit thus
far has been as varied as the per
sonalities of the ministers who
have filled it each Sunday. There
has never been a word of sectarian
ism spoken. Chaplain Gardner
urged upon the students of the Uni
versity the necessity of doing their
part in maintaining and aiding the
institution, especially in the matter
of regular attendance and participa
tion in the song service. The stu
dents in aiding the choir would
themselves be the means of leading
the services. Religion must never
become conventional or cheap. No
sensational nor common methods
for gaining allegiance will ever be
employed. Realizing that upon

virtue and piety depends the char
acter of the individual, the Univer
sity has taken upon itself the duty
of helping him to acquire this, and
teaching him the principles to
guide him morally and spiritually.
In the afternoon Mr. Gardner
spoke of the relation of the church
to the University in its capacity as
minister of beauty, duty, and ser
vice.
