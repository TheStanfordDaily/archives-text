# FRESHMEN VS. SOPHOMORES.
## First Interclass Game Will Be Played on Varsity Diamond Tomorrow. 
### 
The P reshmen and Sophomores
will line up tomorrow afternoon at
3:30 on the Varsity diamond for
the first interclass game. Both
teams are made up of good players,
and the game will probably be
close. The Sophomores have the
benefit of more experience, but they
are handicapped by the loss of
Wiley, who caught lust year. The
catcher's position will probably be
filled by West, who with Sales will
form the battery. The infield,
with the addition'of Lill at third
base, will be stronger than it was
last year. Wirt, who played short
stop last year, will change his posi
tion to center field, and with How
ard and Hudson the right field will
be strong. Williams will play
short-stop, the position he occupied
on last year's Varsity, an 1 Colbert
will play first and Weinmann sec
ond base.
The Freshman team has not been
positively selected, but the general
line-up of the team is known.
Chalmers and Stott will form a
strong battery for the first-year
team. Presley on first, Swain, cap
tain of the team, on second, and
Kelly at third are all good men at
their positions, and with Stagner,
lihyne, or Wagner at short-stop
should form a strong infield. The
outfield positions are somewhat in
doubt, but it is probable that Mor
row, Burtis, and Nissen will fill
these places.
The probable line-up of the teams
follows:
Freshmen —Chalmers, pitcher;
Stott, catcher; Presley, first base;
Swain, second base; Kelly, third
base; Stagner, short-stop; Morrow,
left field; Burtis, center field; Nis
sen, right field.
Sophomores — West, catcher;
Sales, pitcher; Colbert, first base;
Weinmann, second base; Williams,
short-stop; Litt, third base; How
ard, left field, Wirt, center field;
Hudson, right field.
The Sophomores will meet on the
field at three o'clock for practice
and to elect a captain.
The game will be called at 3:30.
Admission will be 10 cents.
