# MUSICAL CLUBS' CONCERT.
## Strengthened Organization to Give an Entertainment Two Weeks Hence. 
### 
Arrangements are being made
by Tieasurer Cowden for the return
concert of the Combined Glee and
Mandolin Clubs, which will be
given in Assembly Hall on Satur
day night, February Oth. The
program has not been prepared,
but it will be composed of the num
bers which proved most successful
on the Northern tour of the clubs.
The purpose of the concert is to
clear the debt incurred, owing to a
sequence of unfortunate circum
stances, during the Northern trip.
The concert here will be even better
than those given on the tour, for
the clubs will be strengthened by
the presence of all the members,
many of whom did not make the
tour. E. 11. May, '06, and D. 11.
Wilson, '06, will have a new
specialty act, and C. L. Firebaugh,
'04, will sing a solo. The follow
ing excerpt from the Seattle Times
is an excellent indication of the
good work of the clubs:
"Stanford University ought to
feel proud of the young men whom
she has sent out this winter to rep
resent her through the Northwest
in a gleeful and mandolinic sort of
way. The college musical clubs
appeared at the Grand last night
before a compact audience, and
gave a college entertainment which
was a little better than anything of
the sort seen here in years. The
Mandolin Club is great. It is
trained down to the fineness of a
hair, and its selections were excel
lently chosen and splendidly ren
dered The boys went over a lot of
the ' Prince of Pilsen ' music, and
earned many recalls for that pretti
est of light an 1 late melody.
" The Glee Club is made up of
fine voices, and it, too, was high in
the public favor. It rendered the
Heidelberg stein song from 'Pilsen'
in wonderful shape, and 'We're All
Good Fellows,'from ' The Chaper
ones,' was a gem as well. The
comedy was a good feature of the
bill, being furnished by Hooper,
Perrin, Lanagan, and Hush in
quartets, and by Bush and Baker,
last year's favorite comedy team."
