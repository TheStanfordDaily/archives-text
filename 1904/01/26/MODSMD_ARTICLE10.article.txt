# BASKET-BALL WORK BEGINS.
## Small Number of Men Report but Prospects Good for Strong Team. 
### 
A small number of men reported
at Encina gymnasium last night
for the first basket-ball practice of
the season. The regular work will
probably begin next week, when
every man is expected to report for
schedule work.
H. W. Chappel, '01, will be the
coach, and will takecompletecharge
of the work this year. A large num
ber of the men who had expressed
an intention of taking up basket
bail this semester have either gone
011 the track or have signed for
baseball, and as a result there is
a dearth of good material for the
basket-ball team. The men who
showed up well at last night's
practice are Collyer, '04, Millar,
'06, Cahoon, '06, Meikle, '06, and
Pandoe, '07.
The loving-cup, which will be
contested for again this year, is now
held by the University of Califor
nia, which won it last year for the
first time. The San Francisco
Y. M. C. A. won it the year before,
and the Oakland Y. M. C. A. dur
ing two previous seasons. To keep
the cup permanently a team must
win it three times. The teams in
the league are evenly matched this
season, and it is impossible to
forecast the outcome of the ser
ies, although Stanford has every
prospect of being well represent
ed.
