The University Glee and Man
dolin CI u 1)8 depend upon their
concerts at the University and in
San Jose to remove any deficit that
may be incurred on the holiday
tours. Heavy financial loss was
experienced this year. The coming
concert will be of high merit and
will deserv a crowded house.
That fact alone should call forth
the attendance of the entire Uni
versity community. Hut as an
additional reason, it can be urged
that the student body should sup
port the musical clubs. The an
nual holiday tour has resulted in a
financial deficit, but the actual gain
to the University more than coun
terbalances any loss of this nature.
The recent tour of the clubs brought
home to the residents of the North
west some idea of Stanford and
Stanford men. The alumni in the
Northern cities gave their support
in bringing the members of the
clubs in touch with the people of
the Coast. As long as 'the clubs
maintain the character of their
membership this must, of a neces
sity, be a great argument to bring
men to Stanford in future years,
and there is no more legitimate
manner of putting the name of the
University before the public than
this. The whole student body, the
entire University has been benefit
ted, arid in turn the student body
and the University community
should repay the unsought obliga
tion under which they stand. The
concert should be attended both for
its merit and for the financial ben
efit it will give the clubs, for if the
members find that these trips will
result in heavy loss to themselves,
they will of course entirely aban
don them.
