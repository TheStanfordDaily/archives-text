Editor Daily Palo Alto:
What promipes to be one of the
most interesting and instructive
lectures that will have been given
at Stanford during recent years is
the address that Mr. William But
ler Yeats will deliver in the chapel
next Friday afternoon under the
auspices of the English Club. As
has already been stated in the
Daily Palo Alto, Mr. Yeats is a
distinguished Irish poet, orator and
dramatist. Hut more than that,
his name is inseparably linked
with the revival of the Celtic move
ment in modern literature. By
original work and by editing the
work of those who have written
before him, he has brought about
a renaocence of the typical Celtic
literature.
He will deliver a lecture at Stan
ford because of the generosity of a
lover of literature in San Francisco
who made arrangements by which
Mr. Yeats will speak both at Cali
fornia and at Stanford. Lest there
be lost the rare opportunity that
is offered to every one at Stanford
to hear this distinguished man
speak of his own work and the
movement to which he has devoted
his energies, I take this means of
calling attention to the importance
of his work.
To show the position which Mr.
Yeats holds in the literary world it
is only necessary to quote briefly
from Mr. Richard Ashe King, in
an article on the work of Mr-
Yeats, in the Bookman. He writes
as follows:
"Modern Ireland has produced
nothing so exquisitely Celtic, in
tense and lovely as Mr. Yeat's
poetry, or so inherently Irish. It
has no need to protest itself Irish
by an obtrusive patriotism, by the
wearing of the green upon the
sleeve, Bince its very soul is Irish.
It is not a spray of plucked sham
rock, but the shamrock itself alive
and dewy, growing naturally
(without, so to say, the self
consciousness of being an em
blem) on its native sod. Mr. Yeats
has brooded upon Ireland, upon
her legends, her songs, her peasant
ry, her scenery, till like the brood
ing sibyl he is inspired and the
soul of his country sighs through
his verse."
The subject of Mr. Yeats' lecture
cannot but be of general interest,
and no one should lose the chance
of hearing him.
