# SECOND CHAMBER CONCERT
## Musical Numbers of Program Which Will Be Given in Assembly Hall Friday. 
### 
The leading number on the pro
grain for the second of the chamber
concerts, to be given on the evening
of January 29th, will lie Mavdn's
quartette, "The Lark," written for
strings in D major, Opus 64. It
has gained this name from its
bright character and from the re
semblance of one of its phrases to
the call of the lark. The "Crea
tion" and the "Seasons," his two
great oratorios, are full of this kind
of music. Haydn, who is the
father of the string quartette, wrote
nearly all of his seventy-seven com
positions in this form for four ex
cellent players who formed the or
chestra —that of Prince Esterhazy
—which he conducted during the
most important year of his musi
cal activity. These quartettes are
the work on which the fame of the
composer may be said chiefly to
rest.
Another number will be a selec
tion from Mendelssohn in D, Opus
44, No. 3. This is the third of
Mendelssohn's quartettes for strings,
and is by many considered his fin
est. It was written about 1858,
and exemplifies his mastery of form
as well i\H of melody. The cham
ber music of Mendelssohn ranks as
high as anything he composed.
Cherubini's "Scherzo" will also
be played. It is a particularly
happy inspiration, treated with all
the skill and finesse that has given
its composer his high rank among
serious musicians. As far as tech
nique goes, probably there was
never a finer writer than Cherubini.
Two waltzes by Dvorak will com
plete the instrumental program.
These waltzes were given to Mr.
Koptu, the leader of the quartette,
by the composer, who took them
from the peasant atmosphere of his
fatherland. Their rhythms are pe
culiarly Slavic, and their treatment
characteristic of a dance form that
suggests the influence of the Gypsy
music.
The numbers for Mrs. Schneider's
program, the vocal soloist, will be
published later.
