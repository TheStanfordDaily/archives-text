# BOATING ASSOCIATION
## Extensive Preparations for Season's Rowing Will Begin at Once. 
### 
The Boating Association will be
gin work next week in preparation
for the first season of actual boat
ing on Lagunita. The first step
will be the removal of the boat
house from its present location to
a site across the lake directly south
west from where it now stands.
The present position of the boat
house makes its approach incon
venient, and this difficulty will be
eliminated by the level shore on
the southwest side of the lake. A
thorough renovation of the build
ing will also be made. The parti
tions will be torn out, so that one
large room will give ample space
for housing the boats. Three land
ing stages are to be constructed at
the new site selected for the boat
house to provide for the change of
crews without loss of time.
Two pair-oared boats, which were
ordered by the association several
weeks ago, will arrive from San
Francisco next week. The boats
already in use on the lake will be
completely overhauled by an ex
pert boat carpenter, who will begin
his work as soon as the boat-house
is moved. Within two weeks all
repairing and rearranging will
have been completed. The lake
will be filled by that time and
daily practice will begin then.
Preparation for the class regattas
which have been planned by the
Boating Association will commence
at the same time, and the final
events will take place about the
first week in April.
