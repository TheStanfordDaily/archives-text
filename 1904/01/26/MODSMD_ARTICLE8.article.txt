## 
### 
Work 011 the southern portion of
the outer quadrangle has been be
gun again. Several stonemasons
have been put at work on the long
arcade that runs behind Memorial
Church, and it is understood that
the number will be increased so
that the work may be completed
as early as possible. Carpenters
are also at work on the interior of
the new Geology building, at the
southwest corner of the outer quad
rangle. It has been reported that
work will soon be begun on the
new Gymnasium, but the authori
ties state that nothing is likely to
be done until after the rainy sea
son.
The stonework on the different
uncompleted buildings has been
practically at a standstill since
last summer. Operations were
brought to a stop by a strike of the
stonemasons, and when this had
been satisfactorily settled the work
was delayed by an agreement be
tween the University and the con
tractor, who was granted extra
time in which to complete this
work. In the case of the Gymna
sium six months was granted, so
that the contract now calls for the
completion of that building by the
end of this year. The cornerstone
was laid in January, 1903.
