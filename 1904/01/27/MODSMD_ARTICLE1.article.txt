# WILL GO EAST AGAIN.
## Dr. Jordan to Speak at Convention of Association of American Universities. 
### 
President Jordan will go East
again in about two weeks, prima
rily to attend the annual meeting
of the Association of American
Universities at New Haven. The
convention will meet on February
18th, and Dr. Jordan will leave Stan
ford a few days prior to that date.
He will make one of the three prin
cipal addresses of the convention.
He has chosen as his subject " The
Boundaries between College and
University Work."
Dr. Jordan has also been asked
to make the dedicatory address in
connection with the opening of the
new science building of the Univer
sity of Colorado, at Colorado
Springs. In all probability he will
accept several of the many other
invitations to speak that have been
extended to him, before he returns
to Stanford.
During his trip Dr. Jordan will
visit Cornell, Harvard, and a num
ber of other large institutions, if
time permits. He will be absent
from the University for about three
weeks.
