The communication from the
Advisory Board of the Woman's
League deserves the attention and
thoughtful consideration of every
woman in college. There are, of
course, numbers of women included
among those to whom the appeal
is addressed who will find it possi
ble to contribute neither their
financial support nor their time to
the organization. The other and
larger class of women, however,
should heartily cooperate with
the League in the excellent work
that it is planning. There arise
many problems in this community
that belong essentially to the
women, and the existence of some
definite organization that is pre
pared to meet these problems can
not but be of the greatest benefit to
all concerned.
