Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In order to avoid any friction in
the securing of seats by those hold
ing season tickets to the second
chamber concert, a word of expla
nation seems necessary. There will
be two entrances to Assembly Hall
Friday night—one on the side
next to Memorial Court, and the
other the main entrance in front.
The gallery doors will not be open.
Those holding season tickets with
their seat-marks indicated thereon,
are requested to present them at
the side entrance. Those holding
partial tickets, who have not ex
changed them for single-seat tick
ets and are willing to take any
available seat, may also present
their tickets at the side door.
Holders of single tickets only
should apply for admission at the
front door. Those holding partial
season tickets may exchange them
for single tickets at either the
Stanford Pharmacy, Palo Alto, or
the Bookstore on the campus.
