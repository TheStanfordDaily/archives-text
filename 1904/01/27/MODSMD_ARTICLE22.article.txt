# Material Scarce for Carnot.
## 
### 
The Carnot debating team is ex
periencing an unusual amount of
difficulty in procuring sufficient
material to use in preparation for
the coming contest. But a com
paratively small amount of the
best material on the French judic
ial system is available in the Uni
versity Library.
The Public Library in San Fran
cisco has some additional material
but it is impracticable for the Stan
ford debaters to attempt to use this.
