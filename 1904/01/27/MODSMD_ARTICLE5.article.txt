# FRESHMEN WIN.
## First Game in Interclass Series Is Broken Up in Last Inning. 
### 
The Freslnnen defeated the
Sophomores yesterday in the first
interclass game by the score of 10
to 8. In the ninth inning the last
man at the hat for the Sophomores
tried to catch the ball but missed
it and it bounced into the crowd.
The game broke up in a scrimmage
for the ball. The Sophomores had
two men out and needed two more
runs to tie the score, so it is proba
ble that the result of the game
would not have been changed had
it been played to the end.
The game was interesting
throughout, and during the first
five innings the score was close;
but in the sixth and seventh in
nings the Freshmen gained a lead
that was too large for the Sopho
mores to overcome. The Freshmen
were able to make most of their
runs on account of the poor catch
ing of Cutler and West, neither of
whom is an experienced man be
hind the bat.
The Sophomores were at the bat
first, and were put out in one, two,
three order by Chalmers' effective
pitching. The Freshmen succeeded
in getting two runs over the plate
in their half of the first inning. In
the second inning the Sophomores
tied the score and the Freshmen
were retired without a run. From
this time until the sixth inning the
score was first in favor of one side,
then the other.
In the sixth inning, with two
out, the Freshmen had two men on
bases. Presley hit to center field,
and two men scored on Wirt's
error. Wirt partially retrieved
himself by knocking a home run in
the ninth, but the game was
already lost.
Sales, Litt, and Howard played
the best ball for the Sophomores,
and Morrow, Chalmers, and Kelly
for the Freshmen. Chalmers
pitched a strong game, allowed but
few hits, and proved most effective
toward the end of the contest. Sales
hit well and pitched a good game,
but was handicapped by poor sup
port. Wirt was erratic in the field
but was strong at the bat.
The teams lined up as follows:
Freshmen —Stott, catcher; Chal
mers, pitcher; Presley, first base;
Swain, second base; Kelly, third
base; Rhyne and Wagner, short
stop; Morrow, left field; McLain,
center field; Nissen and Stagner,
right field.
Sophomores —Cutler and West,
catchers; Sales, pitcher; Colbert,
first base; Weinmann, second base;
Litt, third base; Williams, short
stop; Howard, left field; Wirt, cen
ter field; Hudson, right field.
R. A. Williams was elected cap
tain of the Sophomore team imme
diately before the game. Williams
played on his class team last year,
and made the Varsity at short
stop.
