# TO PLAY SANTA CLARA.
## First Outside Game of Varsity Will Be Against Strong Team. 
### 
The Stanford baseball men will
play the first game of the season
with an outside team tomorrow
afternoon, when they will meet the
Santa Clara College nine on the
latter's campus at Santa Clara.
Special interest attaches to the con
test because of the fact that Santa
Clara always puts out a strong
team, and to secure a victory
over her requires work of good
quality. Last year the Varsity
team was outplayed by the Santa
Clara men even up to the final
games. It is not expected that the
game tomorrow will he a very fine
exhibition of ball-playing, owing to
the insufficient amount of practice
the men have had and the laclc of
any developed team work, but
every effort will be made to keep
the game as free from errors as pos
sible. In this regard the Santa
Clara players will have a decided
advantage, as they have had longer
practice and greater opportunity to
produce better team work.
Captain Ball will take about
twelve men to Santa Clara. The
first line-up will probably be as
follows: Catcher, Ball; pitcher,
Sales; first base, Blake; second
base Swain; third base, Trow
bridge; short-stop, Williams; left
field, Colbert; center field. Wirt;
right field, Knight. In the latter
half of the game Sales will be re
tired from the box in favor of
Roosevelt. Tritch, the Varsity
pitcher, will not make the trip.
The few substitutes who are taken
along will also be given a chance,
and there may be some shifting of
positions among the original nine.
There will be six Varsity men on
the team â€”Ball, Blake, Trowbridge,
Williams, Wirt, and Knight. Ball
caught three years ago, and played
third base last year. Blake, at
first, and Knight, in right field,
will be in the same positions they
had in the Varsity games two years
ago. Williams, who played short
stop last year, will be in his old
place again in tomorrow's trial.
Trowbridge, who played right field
in the second intercollegiate game
last spring, has been shifted to
third; and Wirt, the other right
fielder of last year, will cover center
field. Colbert, who played first on
the '06 class team and has been
trying for that place on the Var
sity, will be given a trial in left
field, where it is necessary to de
velop a Varsity man to replace
Lowenthal, '03. Colbert may he
shifted to first during the progress
of the game. Swain, the Freshman
captain, will play second, his old
position in preparatory school.
Captain Hall has not decided
definitely whom he will take with
him as substitutes. The men will
be picked after a consultation with
Coach Doyle tonight. Doyle will
go to Santa Clara with the team,
in order to get some idea of how
the men play in an actual contest.
