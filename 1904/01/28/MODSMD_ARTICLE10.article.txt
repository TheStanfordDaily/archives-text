# TRAINING RULES IN FORCE.
## Season Opens Next Monday.â€” Several Average Records Made Last Week. 
### 
The track season for the present;
semester will he inaugurated form
ally when training rules go into
effect next Monday. The candi
dates will not sign training rules',"
but Trainer Moulton has a list of
men who are trying out for the
team, and the first man who is dis
covered breaking the unwritten
law will he summarily expelled
from the squad.
Student rubbers will attend to
the track squad after February Ist.
They will lie in the rubbing-shed
between the hours of 10:00 and
12:00 in the morning, and 3:ooand
5:30 in the afternoon. The man
agement desired to have student
rubbers in attendance during everv
hour of the day, but it was found
to be impossible to arrange conven
ient periods.
Trainer Moulton and Captain
Holman are intensely disappointed
at the small number of men who
are training for some of the events.
Of these the high hurdles is the one
that is causing the greatest anxi
ety. No one is trying out for this
event at the present time, in spite
of the fact that Moulton has an
nounced that he will give special
attention to any one who will begin
training.
The track is in excellent shape,
and some trials have been run on
it this week. No time was taken in
the longer distances, as the men
are not in condition to make a
showing in these events.
Iji the 220-yard dash Luce, '04,
has run the distance in 25 seconds.
Grossman, '04, holds the best rec
ord for the season in the 440-yard
dash. He ran the quarter in 56:1.
Freeman, '06, has covered the dis
tance in 57:3; Alvord, '06, in 59:2;
and Russell, '06, has made a record
of 58 seconds in this event. In the
880-yard run Hamilton, '04, has
made a record of 2:15; Wright, '07,
has covered the distance in 2:18;
and Maloy, '06, has made it in
2:19.
The candidates who are trying
out for the field events are gener
ally doing very satisfactory work.
In the high jump Henley, '04, Bell,
'05, and Kearns, '07, have all gone
over 5:5. In the broad jump Hen
ley, '04, Bell, '0.% and West, '06,
are doing over 20 feet, with West
probably making the most consist
ent showing. Moran, '04, Hyde,
'05, Van .Sickle, '05, Estes, '06, and
Leonard, '07, are doing average
work with the hammer.
