Trainer Moulton and Captain
Holnian have announced that
every candidate for the track team
will he expected to keep strict
training rules after next Monday.
There have been times in the his
tory of Stanford when such an
nouncements were greeted with
open derision on the part of the
candidates for the team. Later
there came times when the track
men broke training rules, safe in
the knowledge that they would not
be expelled by the captain if they
were detected, and confident that
they would not be scorned by their
fellow students for disobeying the
rules of the trainer. With a fur
ther development there came a time
when the track management took a
firm stand and declared that any
one who broke training rules would
be publicly expelled from the team.
Men did break training rules, 'and
to the everlasting credit of Stanford
athletics they were publicly ex
pelled. These men were without
exception under-classmen, but that
is their smallest excuse. Some of
them tried to redeem their earlier
fault by coming out again next
season —and that is the best thing
they could have done. But every
one of those men who broke
training rules was ashamed of
himself, and realized that he
could regain the respect of his
fellow students only by the hardest
and most sincere efforts to work for
the welfare of his college.
Enough has been said of the men
who have broken training rules
during past seasons: it is with the
season of 1904 that we are con
cerned. Today no man will be
tolerated for a minute if he breaks
training rules. Me will be expelled
from the squad, he will be ostra
cized by his fellow students, and in
a thousand ways he will be made
to feel that he is not the upright
gentleman that Stanford men are

proud to number in their ranks.
The sentiment of the student body
is clear upon this point. The en
tire college will support the trainer
and captain in whatever action
they may be forced to take. If
there are any men who have ap
peared on the track before, and do
not know that they will keep
training rules throughout the re
mainder of the seapon, it would be
better for them, better for the team,
and better for the college, that
they leave the squad at once.
It is the hope of every one of
us that the coming season will
be a successful one; it is the
duty of every one of us to contrib
ute to this end by every means in
his power. The question must be
faced fairly and honestly, and we
believe that there will be no need
for any one to speak of the subject
again until the season has come
to an end.
