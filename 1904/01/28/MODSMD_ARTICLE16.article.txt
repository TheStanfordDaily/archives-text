The Eastern intercollegiate track
games will be held this year on
Franklin Field, Philadelphia. This
decision was reached at the meet
ing of the executive committee of
the Intercollegiate Amateur Ath
letic Association of America held
at Cambridge, Mass., Saturday,
January 16. When the old Berke
ley oval field of Morris Heights,
New York, which has been used
for these intercollegiate contests
for years, was broken up into build
ing lots last year, it became neces
sary to find another place of
meeting. None was available in
New York, but both Pennsylvania
and Harvard offered their athletic
fields. Harvard was anxious to
have the meet go to Cambridge,
but the vote was four to one against
that place and in favor of Phila
delphia. In the resolution which
was adopted there was a clause
which said that the intercollegiate
meet may be held in Cambridge in
1905, if, in the opinion of the ex
ecutive committee it seemed best.
