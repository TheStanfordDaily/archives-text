# Progress of Mosaic Work.
## 
### 
The Italian artisans who have
been doing the mosaic work on the
interior of Memorial Church have
at last finished their work. The
entire east and west walls have
been covered with mosaics and
carved work. Home of the mosaics
are of plain gold, while a large
number represent scriptural inci
dents. Since the completion of the
mosaics on the west wall, the gold
mosaics have shown up in two dif
ferent colors, some light, while oth
ers are very dark. It has been
decided therefore to put the scaf
folding back again and remove the
darker spots of the mosaics to make
the entire work uniform.
