In connection with the visit of
Yeats, an article on the young
Irish poet, published in the
Alumni Register of the University
of Pennsylvania last January, is of
interest. The article was written
by Cornelius Weygrandt, a man
especially fitted, through personal
knowledge, to speak of Yeats and
the Celtic movement for which he
stands. Weygrandt quotes the fol
lowing letter from Robert Louis
Stevenson to Yeats:
"Valima, Samoa, April 14, 1894.
Dear Sir:— Long Bince, when 1
was a boy, I remember the emotions
with which I repeated Swinburne's
poems and ballads. Some ten
years ago a similar spell was
cast upon me by Meredith's 'Far
in a Valley,' the stanzas begin
ning' When her mother, tends her,'
haunted me and made me drunk
like wine; and I remember waking
with them the echoes in the hills
about Hyeres. It may interest you
to know that I have a third time
fallen in slavery: this is to your
poem called 'The Lake Isle of In
nisfrae.' It is so quaint and airy,
simple, artful, and eloquent to the
heart —but I seek words in vain.
Enough that 'always night and
day I hear lake water lapping with
low sounds on the shore,' and am
"Yours gratefully,
"Robert Louis Stevknson."
Weygrandt then goes on to say:
"With such authority to back me
am 1 rash in saying that among
the poets that are writing in a new
way, that is in a way that does not
win through its reminiscence of
older poets—and excepting the rhe
torical poets whoaredevoted to what
to me is not the highest kind of
poetry —I think among contempor
ary poets of the younger gener
ation not one is of greater accom
plishment than Mr. Yeats. He
writes in a new, an individual way,
a way that does not win through
reminiscence of older poets. He
has had therefore to create his audi
ence; he has had no showy rhetoric
to hang out as a lure, no loud mu
sic whose din no ears could escape.
That he lias, then, won an audience
is a proof of true charm and true
power; an audience won as his has
been won is likely to last."
