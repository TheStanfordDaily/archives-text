# VARSITY WINS.
## Defeats Santa Clara by the Close Score of Eleven to Ten. 
### 
Stanford defeated Santa Clara
College on the latter's diamond
yesterday by the score of 11 to 10,
in a game filled with bad errors.
The result of the contest was in
doubt once only, in the eighth
inning, when the team was on the
verge of going to pieces. Wallman,
the Santa Clara pitcher, was in
effective for the first few innings,
and the Varsity succeeded in mak
ing nine runs. After the fourth
inning Wallman settled down, and
two runs only crossed the plate for
Stanford in the next five innings.
Sales pitched the first five innings
for the Varsity and allowed but
four hits, but, aided by errors,
Santa Clara was enabled to score
five runs. Parker replaced Sales
in the sixth and but threfc hits
were made off his delivery, but
Santa Clara scored five runs in the
last four innings, a number of
errors in Stanford fielding making
this possible. The poor condition
of the field resulted in a large num
ber of misplays for both sides,
although some of Stanford's errors
were due to inaccurate throwing to
bases.
Of the new men on the team
Stott played the best game. He
accepted four chances in the out
field, with but one error, and hit
well. Colbert, in left field, was
slow in handling the ball, but ob
tained a two-base hit in the fourth
inning. Moore, at first, played his
position without an error, but was
weak at the bat. Swain, at second,
had a bad day and went com
pletely to pieces in the last inning,
when he made four errors.
Coach Doyle was present at the
game and was pleased at the result,
especially in regard to the spirit
with which the men played. The
score follows.
