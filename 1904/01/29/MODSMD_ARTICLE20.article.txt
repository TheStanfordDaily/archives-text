# Strength Tests Revised.
## 
### 
At the meeting of College Gym
nasium Directors held in Prince
ton recently, changes were made in
the intercollegiate strength test,
and hereafter the seven exercises to
be used in computing the total
strength of an individual will be
as follows: 1. Strength of back,
tested by pulling on a dynamome
ter with legs straight. 2. Strength
of legs, tested by pulling on a
dynamometer by straightening the
legs. 3 and 4. Strength of right
and left forearm, tested by squeez
ing a spring dynamometer with the
hands. 5. Strength of lungs, test
ed by blowing into a spirometer.
6. Strength of upper arms, biceps,
and chest, tested by raising and
lowering the body between the par
allel bars as often as possible. 7.
Strength of upper arms, triceps,
and back, tested by chinning on
the horizontal bar as many times
as possible. The strength of the
lungs may also be computed by ob
taining one-twentieth of the ca
pacity of the lungs.
In competition the tests must be
made consecutively in the order
mentioned, and must be completed
in fifteen minutes. A rest of only
one minute is allowed between tests
6 and 7, as these are also intended
to test the power of repeated effort
and to try the action of heart and
lungs.
