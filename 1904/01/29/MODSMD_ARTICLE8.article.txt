# CONCERTS BY BAND.
## Promenades Will be Given on the Quad During Present Semester. 
### 
Following the custom recently
established in neveral of the Eastern
universities, the University Band,
under the direction of M. H.
Thorpe, '05, is preparing an inno
vation in the form of an open-air
evening concert to be given some
time in February. The plan is to
have a moonlight promenade
around the inner quad, for which
the music will be furnished by the
band. Arrangements are being
made with the Executive Commit
tee of the Associated Students for
the erection of a temporary band
stand in the middle of the quad.
If the first promenade proves a suc
cess it will probably be made a
regularly recurring event, and as
such it will be placed upon the
University Calendar.
For the first promenade, for
which the date has been provision
ally set for February 26th, the
band is practicing a number of
new selections which will be played
by them for the first time. An en
tirely new grade of music is being
taken up; it is almost wholly of a
concert nature. Among those
pieces which will be rendered are
selections from Verdi's "II Trova
tore," the popular selection, "Tone
Pictures of North and South," by
Rendid, besides solos and airs from
popular operas.
The main objects of the proposed
promenades are to bring the stu
dent body together oftener, in a
social way, and to furnish the Uni
versity community with a high
class band music. The clearness of
the evening and the design and
plan of the campus and building
make Stanford peculiarly well
adapted to promenades of this
kind. The only custom of this na
ture that has been practiced at the
University is the Senior Promenade
Concert, which is always one of the
most enjoyable events of Com
mencement. The degree of success
of the first concert will determine
whether or not it can be made reg
ular.
