# ST. MARY'S DEFEATS VARSITY.
## Game Replete with Errors Results in Score of Nine to Four. 
### 
St. Mary's College of Oakland
defeated the Varsity on Saturday
in a poor exhibition of baseball by
the score of 9 to 4. Stanford played
a ragged game of baseball from the
start and St. Mary's had no trouble
in scoring a victory. The visitors
gained the lead in the first inning
and the result was never in doubt.
Ferguson, the St. Mary's pitcher,
had the Varsity batters puzzled
throughout the game, except in the
fourth inning when he grew wild
and walked five men, forcing two
runs. He struck out ten men and
but five hits were obtained from
his delivery.
Tritch pitched the first four
innings for the Varsity, but was in
poor form and lacked control.
Roosevelt relieved him in the fifth
inning but he also lacked con
trol and did not prove effective.
Two of Stanford's runs were
made in the fourth inning on a
number of bases on balls. The
other two runs were made in the
eighth on two hits, an error, and
a base on balls. St. Mary's made
most of her runs one at a time, but
in the seventh the Varsity made a
number of errors which, coupled
with two hits, allowed four runs to
cross the plate for the visitors. The
game was uninteresting from the
start and showed poor form on the
part of the Varsity players, as they
made but five hits and had a total
of twelve errors charged against
them.
Phelan, St. Mary's third-base
man, had his foot injured by the
cleats from a runner's shoe, and
had to retire from the game, his
place being taken by a substitute.
