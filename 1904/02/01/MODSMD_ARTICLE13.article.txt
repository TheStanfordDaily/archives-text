# Second Chamber Concert.
## 
### 
A well-filled house greeted the
second chamber concert Friday
evening. The Kopta Quartet have
attained a high degree of efficiency,
and play together with a precision
and harmony that comes only after
long practice together. Mrs.
Schneider, the vocal soloist, shows
control and tone which distinguish
a great singer.
Every number on the program
was well received. Of the music
by the quartet the most popular
seemed to be the "Scherzo" by
Gherubini, the weird Polish waltzes
by Dvorak, and the pleasing selec
tions from Mendelssohn. Of the
vocal selections all were highly ap
preciated, that of "Abschied," the
words to which were written by
Dr. Goebel, being particularly well
taken.
