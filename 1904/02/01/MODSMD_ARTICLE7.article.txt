# YEATS DELIVERS A LECTURE.
## Young Critic Speaks of the Heroic Poetry of Ancient Ireland. 
### 
William Butler Yeats, the famous
young Irish poet, delivered a lec
ture on "The Heroic Poetry of An
cient Ireland 1 ' before a large
audience in Assembly Hall on Fri
day afternoon. The lecture, which
was given under the auspices of the
English Club, was originally sched
uled for the chapel, but the crowd
was beyond the capacity of that
room and Assembly Hall was
opened. About eight hundred per
sons attended the lecture, and gave
the speaker warm and frequent ap
plause.
Mr. Yeats, who was introduced
by President Johnson of the Eng
lish Club, first spoke of the old
Irish legends. These, he said, had
a great effect upon the national
growth, since they created new
forms of noble life. The legends of
Arthur and Guinevere arose out of
the legends which found their ori
gin among the Irish people. It
was a great many years before the
world came to understand through
able translations the correct trend
of the old writers.
The legends were most of them
written between the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, but some
also in the early part of the nine
teenth century. They were legends
common to the Irish and Scottish
highlands, the characteristics of
whose peoples are in a general way
very similar. The Irish chronicles
were nearly all the work of monks,
who took old gods and heroes and
wove tales about them which grew
and developed as time went by.
Mr. Yeats gave an interesting
outline of several of the old legends,
and told how the characters therein
portrayed were heroes of the Irish
populace. The wildest race that
ever lived, he said, had created
some of the wildest poetry. Dra
matic love came into the world
through this early poetry. Until
this time, until this poetry came to
influence their lives, men did not
have the reverence for women that
became a part of their character as
a result of it. Some of the heroes
and heroines were later developed
by Shakspere. All ancient and
heroic poetry, the speaker said, was
an endeavor to create types of
heroic man-hood and womanhood.
The speaker depicted the condi
tions of the poor Irish peasants,
who, he said, were still gentle peo
ple. Ancient and modern views
differ on this point. The ancients
held that culture was the heritage
of the plowman, while the modern
culture is the privilege of a few
people in a small class.
Mr. Yeats read from several of
his poems, which revealed work of
rare skill and beauty.
