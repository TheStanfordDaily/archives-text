We stood on the quad together,
On a far October morn;
When in Santa Clara sunshine,
The Stanford spirit was born.
The spirit of love and honor,
In hearts that all meanness scorn.
Then here's to the red roof tiling,
And here's to the palms that wave,
To the memories beguiling,
'To the comradeships that save;
And here's to the Stanford spirit
That shall last beyond the grave.
