# LIGHTS FOR ENCINA HALL.
## Electricity to Remain On Until Midnight as a Month's Experiment. 
### 
The trouble over kerosene lamps
in Encina Hall has been solved by
the decision to keep the electric
1 igh ts burning until midnight.
The decision was reached by the
Board of Trustees at its meeting in
San Francisco on Saturday, and
was taken in answer to an appeal
from the men of the Hall.
After the removal of the lamps
many of the men who could not
finish their work by 10:30 were ser
iously inconvenienced. it was
then proposed by the authorities
that the large alcoves on each floor
of the Hall should be fitted up as
study-rooms in which the lights
would remain on until midnight,
and to which every one would have
access when the other lights were
turned off at 10:30.
This plan was not generally
favored by the students, and it
was then suggested that if the au
thorities would permit the lights to
continue until midnight the men
would undertake to turn them off
in their rooms when not in actual
use. It is expected that the saving
effected in this way will almost, if
not fully, counterbalance the cost
of burning during the additional
hour and a half.
Dr. Jordan placed the proposal
before the Board of Trustees, and
that body agreed to continue the
lights until midnight for one
month, during which time an ac
curate record of the amount of elec
tricity used will be kept. If the
experiment justifies it, the lights
will then he kept on permanently
until midnight.
