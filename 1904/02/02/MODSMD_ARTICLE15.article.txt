The men of Encina Hall are to
be congratulated upon their suc
cess in securing lights until mid
night. The action of the Board of
Trustees in granting this privilege
is a big step in the right direction.
The fact that the lights were extin
guished at an early hour has always
been the one great drawback of life
in the Hall. The man who lived
there has been under a disadvan
tage as compared with those who
lived elsewhere. He has paid
dearly for any time spent in
social relaxation after dinner when
he haH been compelled to work
with an eye-destroying candle or a
forbidden lamp. The complete
banishment of the latter left him
helpless. During the stress of ex
amination time the turning out of
the lights has been extremely
aggravating. The result has been
discontent and evasion. The ex
tension of reasonable privileges by
the trustees has already caused a
healthy change in the attitude of
the Hall men, and they now stand
pledged to work hand in hand
with the authorities to keep down
expenses so that necessary accom
modations may be furnished.
