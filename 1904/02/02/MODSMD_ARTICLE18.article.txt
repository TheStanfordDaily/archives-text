Bishop John \V. Hamilton, D.D.,
of Boston, Mass.,, preached at the
morning service in Memorial
Church last Sunday. The subject
followed by Dr. Hamilton was the
futility of choosing war as a means
of settling the great contentions
that arise among the nations of the
earth. He maintained that war is
a weapon of a rude nature, of a
rude people, of a rude age —already
an antiquated thing, a mode of
paganism. It settles nothing, ac
complishes nothing. The history
of the world has been only a his
tory of battle, and in that regard
has been a failure. There are three
incentives at the basis of all war:
the motive of the stronger to force
the weaker;jthe extension of terri
tory, or greed; and the spirit of
vengeance, or jealousy. No defini
tion can be given of war unless it
be that might makes right, using
the natural expression of paganism
—physical force.
The common belief that war set
tles anything is an utter fallacy.
There is no admission of wrong in
real defeat. The convictions of the
vanquished party after a battle
will remain as they were before,
and not until after years of medi
tation and earnest reasoning will
those convictions be changed. The
speaker sought to show that the
Civil War did not settle the slavery
question nor the Revolutionary
War the differences between Amer
ica and England. He held that in
both cases it was the change of con
viction on the part of the people
after years of contemplation.
Dr. Hamilton said that he did
not mean to assert that war has
not been a factor in changing agen
cies and conditions in the world's
history. But he held that the only
final method of settling the great
problems in dispute is the applica
tion of the principles of honesty
and truth laid down bv Christ.
