# TRACK SEASON BEGINS.
## Strict Training Begun by Athletes First Meet Next Saturday Morning. 
### 
Although the track squad has
been appearing for light work dur
ing the past two weeks, formal
training rules did not go into effect
until yesterday. From now on
until the intercollegiate meet, the
candidates will observe training,
and the least infraction of the un
written law will cause the instant
expulsion of the offender from the
squad. The first day of the train
ing season witnessed a decided
increase in the size of the track
squad.
The appearance of a number of
candidates for the high hurdles
during the past week has greatly
encouraged Trainer Moulton, who
expressed himself last week as
keenly disappointed in regard to
the outlook in this event. These
new men are practically without
experience,and Moulton will devote
special attention to their develop
ment. It is hardly possible to
develop a winning hurdler in the
space of time intervening before the
intercollegiate field-day, but the
members of a winning squad for
next year will be formed.
The field-day to be held on the
oval next Saturday morning prom
ises to be one of the most interest
ing meets of the season. An
unusual feature of the day will be
a 2-mile relay race participated in
by two teams of sixteen men each.
Each contestant will run 220 yards.
To avoid injury to those candi
dates who are not yet in the best
condition, most of the running
events will be shorter than the
regulation distance. For the 2-mile
run, 1£ miles will be substituted;
for the mile run, 112 of a mile will be
run; the 4-mile run is reduced to
660 yards; and the 440-yard dash
will be replaced by one of 300
yards. Five hurdles will be run in
each of these events. No reduction
will be made in the two short
dashes.
In the half-mile run the entries
will be divided into two squads.
The first squad will consist of
experienced men who have records
at that distance. The second will
be composed solely of novices. It
is probable that a similar division
will be made in the mile run. The
two-mile run will practically be a
try-out for new men
Captain Holman will not com
pete in the meet, but he may act
as pace-maker for part of the dis
tance in the longer runs.
The meet will begin promptly at
10:00, and no admission will be
charged.
