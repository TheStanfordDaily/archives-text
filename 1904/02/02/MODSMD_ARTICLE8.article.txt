# Preparing for Concert.
## 
### 
Regular practice is going on for
the return concert of the Musical
Clubs, which will be given Satur
day evening, February 6th, in
Assembly Hall. The proceeds
from this concert will be used
toward payment of the deficit in
curred by the clubs during their
recent trip North.
Both the Glee and Mandolin
Clubs were very well received on
their trip this year and called forth
much favorable comment. They
were pronounced by many to be
the best that Stanford has yet pro
duced, and fully as good as those
of eastern universities. The style
of the concert given this year dif
fers from that of former years in
having more chorus work, jollier
songs, and a livelier vein through
out. More specialties have been
introduced to give a lighter tone to
the program, and to add variety.
