# Women Will Raise Tennis Fund.
## 
### 
The women of the University
have undertaken to raise a tennis
fund for the construction of a new
court near Roble gymnasium. The
first effort will be directed toward
an entertainment to which all the
various women's organizations will
contribute. The program will be a
novel one. Each organization will
plan an original entertainment
that will be carried out independ
ently. The numbers on the pro
gram will probably consist of
farces, tableaux, and musical selec
tions, but the entire program will
not be announced until the evening
of the entertainment.
The organizations that will con
tribute are Roble Club, Girls' Glee
and Mandolin Clubs, Saturday
Night Club, Young Women's
Christian Association, Delta Gam
ma, Alpha Phi, Kappa Kappa
Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and
Gamma Beta. The date of the en
tertainment is set for March 12th,
and it will take place either in
Assembly Hall or Roble gymna
sium.
The committee on arrangements
is composed of Mrs. Edith Matzke,
Miss Stella Rose, '00, Mias V.
Townsend, '02, Miss S. R. Park,
'04, and Miss H. Salisbury, '05.
Tickets to the performance will be
available to women only.
