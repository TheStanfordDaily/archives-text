# FIRST GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
## Dr. H.B. Reynolds of San Francisco and President Jordan the Speakers. 
### 
The speakers at the student body
assembly this morning were Dr. H.
B. Reynolds, '96, and President
Jordan. Dr. Reynolds, who is now
a practicing physician in San
Francisco, is president of the Stan
ford Alumni Association in that
city.
Dr. Reynolds said that it
had been reported that college
spirit at Stanford was degenerat
ing; that the undergraduates were
not in accord with the faculty and
the alumni; in brief, the spirit was
not running on a healthy basis.
He had since learned of the falsity
of these statements, he said, and he
came charged with a message from
the alumni of unqualified approval
of what the undergraduates had
done and were doing.
Dr. Reynolds spoke of the quali
ties which make for success in
after life, comparing the qualities
of the good football man with the
traits that insure a man's progress
in the world. The greater part of
the good we get from college, he
said, is not from the text-books we
read, but what we get from associ
ation with other men. If the stu
dents in the conduct of student
affairs display the same qualities
as the football man, not worrying
about the inequalities of the ground
or personal danger, they will be
successful in life. In the world's
work it is necessary to be a man of
energy, of purpose. It is better to
be a little headlong than to be of
too fine scruples. The latter may
never amount to much.
A man must, nevertheless, be ab
solutely under his own control, he
said. It is no credit to a man to
be a good citizen because lie has
not sufficient strength of mind to
be otherwise. He must be able to
take defeat gracefully and victory
magnanimously. Stanford Uni
versity is known among educators
throughout the world as a model
institution. It does not rest with
the faculty or the Board of Trustees
to make the Stanford undergrad
uates the model college students,
that rests with the undergraduates
themselves. They must continue
to build up their college spirit, he
said, until the University is known
for its men as well as its build
ings.
Dr. Jordan spoke for about half
an hour on topics connected with
his recent trip to the East. He
told of his visit to Washington and
his conference with President
Roosevelt regarding the seal and
salmon interests of the North. In
this connection he said the sealß
were now reduced in number to
about 300,000, but they could not
be extinguished as long as the
United States protected the islands
on which they made their homes.
He believed the matter would be
taken up with England at an early
date and full protection given to
the herds.
Dr. Jordan's song, which was to
have been sung for the first time,
was not given owing to the absence
of the Glee Club leader on account
of illness.
