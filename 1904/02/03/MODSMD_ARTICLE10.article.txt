The present baseball season has
made patent one fact that is ex
tremely discreditable to the college.
It is that there are men at Stanford
who will witness a baseball game
without paying for the privilege.
Owing to the fact that the diamond
is not protected by a fence, it is pos
sible for a man to be a spectator at
a game without paying for a seat
on the stands. The man who will
make use of this opportunity is
hardly worthy of the name. It is
absolutely no excuse for him to say
that he can not afford to pay. He
can at least afford to stay away if
he has not the money to see the
game honestly, and a proper sense
of self-respect would force him to
take this step. It is to be hoped
that no one will hesitate to show
his lack of respect for the man who
cheats his way to thegames, and by
so doing contribute by every means
in his power to put a stop to this
dishonest practice.
