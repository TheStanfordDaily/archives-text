### 
Harry de Windt, the famous ex
plorer, is to deliver a lecture at the
University on Wednesday evening,
February 10th. The lecture will
be in Assembly Hall, and will be
under the auspices of the Stanford
University Geological Society.
De Windt will speak of his expe
riences in connection with his trav
els, combining two lectures, "Paris
to New York Overland," and ''Si
beria and the Russian Exiles." De
Windt's feat in crossing Siberia
two years ago astonished the scien
tific world. His object was to as
certain the feasibility of a railway
between France and America, and
also to visit the principal prisons
and convict settlements of Siberia
and give to the world an unbiased
account of the exile system. Dur
ing his trip he and his two com
panions overcame the greatest diffi
culties and suffered severe hard
ships.
