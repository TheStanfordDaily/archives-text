# Tennis Notes.

### 
Work is progressing favorably
on the new tennis courts, and they
will be ready for the first coat of
sand and oil in a few days. The
back-stops of the asphalt court
have been moved back ten feet, and
those for the new courts are being
built on a line with them.
The asphalt court is in constant
use by the men who intend to com
pete for the Varsity tennis team.
Captain Baker of the tennis squad,
F. A. Leib, '02, who played on the
Varsity two years ago, and G. A.
Hodge, '06, who made the team
last year but was unable to partici
pate in the intercollegiate match,
are practicing daily. These men
and several other Varsity possibil
ities are rapidly rounding into
form. The try-out tournaments
this spring will find the contestants
playing in good form.
At California the tennis prospects
are bright, since every man of last
year's varsity team has returned to
college for the spring semester.
Lane, a new player from Southern
California, will probably gain a
place on the Varsity this spring.
McGavin, Baker, and Variel of last
year's team are practicing con
stantly, in anticipation of a hard
struggle with the Stanford team in
April.
