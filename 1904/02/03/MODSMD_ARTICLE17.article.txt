An auditing committee, consist
ing of C. A. Beardsley, J. E. Camp
bell, aud J. L. Maloy, was appointed
to look over the comedy and class
finances. The president also ap
pointed a committee to look into
the matter of class sweaters, and
decide who should wear the 1906
emblem. It was suggested that
every Varsity man in the class be
given the class emblem, and that a
sweater should be given for each
distinct athletic activity. The
committee consists of D. D. Sales,
G. W. Smith, and J. L. Maloy,
chairman.
In view of the fact that the class
is now out of debt, having paid off
the deficit incurred during last
spring, it was decided to appoint a
committee of three to collect the
rest of the assessments, in order to
meet the demand for money re
quired to buy class emblems. Miss
F. Foy, Miss F. M. Grace, and L.
W. Cutler were appointed to make
the remaining collections.
