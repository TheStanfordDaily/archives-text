# WOMEN BEGIN TRAINING.
## Plans for Tennis Tournament with Mills College and University of California. 
### 
Systematic training has been
begun by the Roble gymnasium
tennis squad. The first practice
game with an outside team will be
held Saturday, February 13th, at
9:00, when the women's Varsity
squad will play the Belmont Ten
nis Club. Arrangements are being
made for a match to be played at
Mills College sometime in March.
A contest will probably be ar
ranged between Stanford and Cali
fornia, but nothing has been defi
nitely settled either in regard to
where the meet will be held or
whether it will be in singles or
doubles. California at first refused
to consider doubles, but in all prob
ability this objection will be waived
if the question resolves itself to
this alone.
In the future the tennis cup will
be contested for once each semes
ter in a tournament held solely for
that purpose. Only singles will be
played in this tournament and the
trophy will go to the player who
wins three times during her college
course. All those who win in the
tournament will have their names
engraved upon the cup, as has al
ways been the custom. This tro
phy has never been carried away
for the reason that heretofore per
manent possession has required
three successive victories, and
tournaments were held only the
second semester of each year, which
made it almost impossible for any
one to become the owner of the cup.
At the meeting of the athletic
committee of Roble gymnasium
Friday afternoon it was decided to
begin work at once on the new oil
court. It will be made out of the
same material as the new courts
being finished in front of Encina
Hall. It is estimated that the
cost will be one hundred dollars.
To meet this expense a joint enter
tainment has been planned by the
women of the University to be
given about the middle of March.
If the proceeds from this will not
be sufficient a small assessment will
probably be levied on the members
of the Women's Athletic Associa
tion. The committee having the
tennis court in charge is Miss M.
Foster, '04, and Miss M. Ray, '05.
The members of the tennis squad
for this year are: Misses M. Foster,
'04; M. Ray, '05; G. Pitman, '05;
C. Paine, '06; E. Haywards, '06;
E. Owen,'o7; and R. Gilbert, '06.
Miss M. Hodge, Miss M.Mirsky,
and Miss M. Hendricks, who were
among the strongest players on
last year's team, have left college.
