# Musical Clubs' Concert.

### 
The Musical Clubs are making
active preparations for their concert
in Assembly Hall Saturday night.
The entire repertoires of both clubs
are being thoroughly rehearsed, and
a complete rendition may be ex
pected at the concert. The pro
gram will include all the leading
numbers that were given on the
Northern tour, as well as several
new acts by Baker and Bush.
The Oregon daily Journal of
Portland, for December 29th, has

the following to say regarding the
concert given in that city: " One of
the best audiences of the season
turned out and gave the Stanford
Glee and Mandolin Clubs a splen
did reception at the Marquam
Grand theatre last evening and
thoroughly enjoyed the meritorious
program which the boys furnished.
The clubs are made up from the
classes of the college and include a
number of happy-go-lucky fellows
who could certainly make a hit on
the professional stage. The songs
were of the rollicking order and
combined everything from light
opera selections to campus cho
ruses.
"The Mandolin Club is really
talented and shows the effects of a
very careful and consistent train
ing. It furnished by far the best
amateur instrumental music which
has .been heard in the city this
season. The combined numbers
with both voices and instruments
were very enjoyable.
"Bush and Baker made a decided
hit in their humorous sketches.
They received five or six deter
mined encores. Mr. Stearns' mon
ologue also caught the fancy of the
audience and they insisted on
several encores. His imitation of
a talk over a telephone was ex
ceedingly good. Ralph Lachmund
rendered 'Asleep in the Deep ' in
a splendid manner. Bertrand Cox
sang ' We're All Good Fellows,'
and received an encore,"
