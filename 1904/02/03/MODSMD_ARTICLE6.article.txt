Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Will you kindly allow me, as
chairman of the committee in
charge of the program, to draw the
attention of the University com
munity to the meeting of the Philo
logical Association, which is to be
held tomorrow in memory of Theo :
dore Mommsen, who died a few
months ago. It is well that we, as
University people, should take
special note of the great men who
have done much for literature, art, or
science, and it is therefore peculiar
ly fitting that we should contem
plate the achievements of one
whom the historian Freeman
called " well-nigh the greatest
scholar of all time."
Yours truly,
Feb. 3, 1904. H. R. Fairclough.
