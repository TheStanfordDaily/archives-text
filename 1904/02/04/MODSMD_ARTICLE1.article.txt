Professor Nathan Abbott of tbe
Law department lectured last even
ing to an interested audience upon
David Dudley Field and bis work
in codification. Dr. Abbott gave
a brief review of tbe history of cod
ification and pointed out the parts
played by Hobbes, Locke, Hume,
Burke, Bentham, and Livingston,
down to Field, the last great codi
fier.
An outline was given of Field's
life, and of the remarkable Field
family, every member of which at
tained prominence. His early life
was spent in a New England town;
he graduated from Williams Col
lege in 1825, at the age of twenty,
and began the study of law at Al
bany and later at New York, where
he was admitted to the bar. Here
he made a great success and had
many famous cases. Although
not himself an office-holder he had
a wide influence in the politics of
New York and succeeded in intro
ducing many reforms in the legal
code and procedure of the State.
Although a Democrat he opposed
the extension of slavery, and was a
strong supporter of Lincoln. Field
did a great deal of traveling, visit
ing England and Europe every
year, to gain ideas for his reforms.
His various codes consist of nine
reports and include civil, penal,
political, civil procedure, and
criminal procedure. The influence
of the Field Codes has become so
extensive that probably 40,000,000
people are affected by them.
Many of the American States have
adopted them in part or in whole,
and their influence has beon felt in
Mexico, England, Australia, India,
Straits Settlements, and other coun
tries.
Mr. Field died in 1894, in his
ninetieth year. The eprtaph dedi
cated to him is that "he devoted
his life to the reform of the law, to
codify the common law, to simplify
legal procedure, to substitute arbi
tration for war, to bring justice
within the reach of all."
Dr. Abbott gave an interesting
discussion on codification in gen
eral, defining it, distinguishing it
r C°m the digest and the treatise,
if? nature and the argu
""A for and against its usage.
