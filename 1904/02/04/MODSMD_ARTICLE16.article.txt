# CONSTITUTION FOR GUILD.
## Proposal to Leave to Directors and Executive Committee Fixing of Fee. 
### 
At last night's meeting of the
Executive Committee of the Asso
ciated Students, a revised constitu
tion for the Students' Guild was
submitted by the directors of that
institution, and approved. With
the endorsement of the Guild di
rectors and the Executive Commit
tee, the constitution will be sub
mitted to the Board of Trustees,
and if that body gives its approval,
the proposition will be voted upon
by the student body at the general
election in May.
During the epidemics of the past
year the Guild directors found it
impossible to carry on effective
work under the terms of the pres
ent constitution. The new consti
tution, therefore, is based upon the
knowledge gained from this experi
ence. The object of the Students'
Guild, it is stated, is to provide for
the care of students in times of
sickness, and for the preservation
of the general health of the Uni
versity community. The Executive
Committee is to elect five directors,
and the three members of the Uni
versity Health Affaire Committee
will be ex-officio members of the
board. It is provided that the di
rectors shall not have power to
incur liabilities to a greater amount
than $4000 beyond the accumu
lated assets of the Guild, exclusive
of permanent equipment. The
treasurer will give a bond satis
factory to the directors for the
faithful performance of his trust.
Regarding the Guild fee, which
was arbitrarily fixed by the Uni
versity and the payment of which
was made compulsory this year,
the constitution provides as fol
lows: "There shall be a semester
fee to paid at the beginning of
each semester by the members of
the Guild. The amount of this fee
shall b% determined by a two-thirds
vote of the Executive Committee of
the student body and Guild board
in joint session, provided that one
week's public notice of the purpose
of such meeting shall have been
given. The payment of such fee
shall constitute the student a mem
ber of the Guild for the current
semester, with full rights in all its
privileges and benefits.
"Members of the Guild shall be
entitled to such care and nursing
in time of sickness as it may be
possible for the board of directors
to provide, and at such charges as
the board may determine."
It is further provided that the
Guild directors may, at their dis
cretion, extend the privileges of the
Guild to members of the faculty,
upon the payment of a special
membership fee. Non-members, in
cases of emergency, may also be
cared for on such terms as the di
rectors may determine.
The constitution states that the
individual liability of a member of
the Guild shall not exceed five
dollars.
Finally, it is provided that this
constitution may be amended at
any regular meeting of the student
body by a two-thirds vote of mem
bers voting on the proposed amend
ments, provided that one week's
public notice of such proposed
amendments shall have been
given, and that the amendments
shall have the recommendation
of the Board of Directors of the
Guild.
