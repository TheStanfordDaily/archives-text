The meeting of the English Club
last night was one of the most
interesting of its sessions this year.
The meeting was at 13 Alvarado
row, Miss Edyth Hale, '04, being
the hostess. Mr. A. A. Browne,
assistant professor of Mechanical
Arts, read several unpublished
stories written by his brother,
David Browne, dealing with inci
dents of their childhood in Ireland.
The stories were all entertaining,
containing delicate humor and
much picturesque detail. 'Sketches
gave glimpses of life in the home
of a Presbyterian minister in a
strongly Catholic country, and of
a boy's life in a boarding-school.
All the stories were delightful
reminiscences, which made the
hearers feel that they had been in
a measure taken into the author's
confidence. After some music, an
informal social session occupied
the rest of the evening.
