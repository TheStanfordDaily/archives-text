# TENTH CARNOT DEBATE.
## Strong Trio Will Represent Stanford in Annual Contest.â€” "French Judicial System," Is General Question. 
### 
held in Harmon Gymnasium on
the campus of the University of
California at eight o'clock tomor
row night.
The Carnot medal is annually
awarded to the one of the six con
testants who shows the greatest
ability in debate. The event had
its origin in an offer of Baron de
Coubertin, who established it in
honor of Sadi Carnot, former Pres
ident of France. The subjects for
discussion are limited to plans for
the governmental policy of France.
Only a very general question is
given out as a study topic to the
speakers until two hours before the
debate, when the particular issue
to be discussed is announced. The
object of conducting the debate in
this manner is to test the powers
of the speakers in extemporaneous
speech.
"The French Judicial System" is
the general question upon which the
debaters have been working for the
past eight weeks, and some phase
of it will be discussed tomorrow
night.
In the try-out at which the
Stanford team was chosen three
weeks ago, the particular question
was: "Resolved, That the ordinary,
civil, and judicial courts of France
should be given complete jurisdic

tion over the acts of administrative
officers and private individuals."
Stanford has probably never
been represented hy a stronger
debating team than that which
will go to Berkeley tomorrow after
noon. Howard M. Lewis, '04,
Great Falls, Montana ; Frank
Iloehr, '04, San Jose; and Alex
ander Sherriffs, '05, San Jose, con
stitute the team. The first two are
veteran debaters, and the third
is not far behind in experience.

Lewis entered the debating field
in his sophomore year. He made
the victorious 1904 Sophomore
class team and last year was listed
on both the Carnot and intercol
legiate teams. In his command of
language, his personality, and his
forcefulness, his strength as a
speaker lies. Lewis is registered
in the department of Law. He is
a member of Bench and Bar Moot
Court, Euphronia Debating Socie
ty, and the Delta Upsilori frater
nity.
Roehr has had the widest exper
ience in debate of any of the
Stanford trio. He debated at the
Santa Clara high school, made the
1904 Freshman team, and repre
sented Stanford in both of the
intercollegiate contests last year.
He is a deliberate and logical
