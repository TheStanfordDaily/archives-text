" Expressions of satisfaction were
general among those attending the
Stanford Glee and Mandolin Clubs
concert last Saturday night at the
Armory Hall. The entertainment
was of a higher grade than is usu
ally dealt out to the residents
of this city, and the attendance
fairly large. The numbers given
by the club were heartily applaud
ed, and encores demanded in many
instances. The concert through
out was full of the spirit and dash
of the University, and was most
typical of college boys.
"The chorus work was splendid.
Mr. Stearns won an encore in his
monologue, as did Bush and Baker
in their eccentricities." *
