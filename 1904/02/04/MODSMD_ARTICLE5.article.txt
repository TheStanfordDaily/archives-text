# Lecture on Sweden.
## 
### 
For several hours last night
more than three hundred people
listened to an illustrated lecture on
Sweden by Mr. B. li. Baumgardt
of Los Angeles. The lecture was
exceedingly interesting and very
effective. Mr. Baumgardt spoke
first of Swedenborg, one of the great
Mystics, and later gave an unus
ually clear picture of the places
which he had visited and seen.
Mr. Baumgardt is a most pleasing
speaker, and showed himself to be
a master of his topic.
A most enjoyable feature of the
lecture was an accompaniment of
stereopticon views. The set is a
fine one, and includes a series of
pictures taken in every part of
â€¢Sweden. Many colored views of
the moon and sun-spots, which
were secured at Yerkes Observa
tory, were presented. The lecture
was an unqualified success, and
the audience was enthusiastic in
recognizing the ability of Mr.
Baumgardt.
