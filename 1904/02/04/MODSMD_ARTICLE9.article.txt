Foit the tenth time in the history
of intercollegiate debating between
Stanford and California, the repre
sentatives of the two colleges will
ineet in the annual struggle for the
Carnot medal. California has had
more than her share of victories in
this event, but the men who will
rep resent Stanford in the approach
ing contest have the confidence of
the student body in their ability to
bring home the medal of victory.
The desire for a successful conclu
sion of the debate should not, how
ever, overshadow our feeling of
loyalty to our representatives,
may be their fortune. They have
worked faithfully for the glory of
their college, and they deserve un
stinted praise even though the vic
tory be not theirs. But one man
can be successful, and he will gain
an ample reward in the applause
always meets the victor. We
expect a Stanford man to win; we
will greet him royally if lie does
win; but whether we must sympa
thize with two men or with three,
let every one be proud of bis repre
sentatives, and let every one try to
repay them for their efforts, by
showing that the college is not
unappreciative of those who do
their best for her.
