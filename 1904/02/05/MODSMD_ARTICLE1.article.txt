# FIRST MEET OF SEASON.
## Track Athletes Will Compete on the Oval in First Competition of the Year.

The track is still in fair shape in j
spite of the recent heavy rain, and ;
unless it is raining tomorrow morn- j
ing the handicap meet will be held |
as originally scheduled. The meet
will be held promptly at 10:00, and I
as the track events and field trials i
will be run off simultaneously, it |
will be over by noon.
