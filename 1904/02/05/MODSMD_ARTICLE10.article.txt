# De Windt's Remarkable Journey.
## 
### 
The overland journey from Paris
to New York made by Mr. Harry
de Windt, F. R. G. S., who will
lecture in Assembly Hall next
Wednesday evening, holds the rec
ord for being the longest continu
ous land journey ever made. The
entire distance covered between the
capital of France and the metrop
olis of America was 18,494 miles,
of which 0,000 were traversed by
means of dog- and reindeer-sleds,
across the desolate wastes of Siberia.
Of the six men who set out from
France, only three lived to reach
New York; the others perished of
cold and starvation on the shores
of the Arctic Ocean.
Harry de Windt's extraordinary
feat has created much talk among
the great scientific men of both
Europe and America. His lecture
is full of interest from start to fin
ish, and, since Nansen's historic
dash for the pole, no recital more
replete with mental and physical
suffering has reached the ears of
American audiences. Even though
the explorer failed in his main
object—that of demonstrating the
possibility of a railway from France
to America —the mere accomplish
ment of this journey, hitherto
deemed impossible, will long he
remembered as one of the greatest
triumphs in the annals of Arctic
exploration.
The lecture is illustrated with
120 stereopticon views taken during
the journey across Siberia, Alaska,
and the Bering Straits.
Reserved seats will lie placed on
sale Monday morning at the Book
store and at the Stanford Phar
macy in I'alo Alto.
