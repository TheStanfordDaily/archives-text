Definite steps have been taken
by the Women's Athletic Associa
tion toward forming a boating
club to be carried 011 in connection
with the gymnasium. It has been
found that the racing-shells can be
used at certain times every day by
the women, and as soon as possible
practice will begin. The committee
appointed to take charge of affairs
is composed of Miss J. Spaulding,
'05, Miss G. Moore, '04, and Miss
C. Atherton, '04, chairman.
