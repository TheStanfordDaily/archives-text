# Philological Association Meets.
## 
### 
One of the best attended and
most interesting meetings of the
Philological Association of recent
years was held yesterday afternoon
in memory of Theodor Mommsen,
the noted German scholar. In ad
dition to the remarks by President
Goebel, there were four papers, each
taking up one phase of Mommsen's
activity.
Assistant Professor K. G. Rend
torff spoke of Mommsen as a man,
touching upon the influences that
led him to devote his life to history
rather than to law. Assistant Pro
fessor J. Elmore read a paper on
"Mommsen and the New Human
ism," emphasizing his efforts to
unite all his-varied study in a
reconstruction of the human life of
ancient Rome. The third paper
was by Instructor E. W. Martin on
"Mommsen and Epigraphy." It
dwelt upon Mommsen's collection
of Roman inscriptions in which he
insisted 011 going back to the origi
nal stones for the sake of thorough
ness and accuracy. Professor A.B.
Show of the Department of History
closed the meeting with a compre
hensive review of Mommsen's work
as an historian. His contributions
to Roman history were of two sorts:
first, in the collecting of materials,
as in his editions of the inscriptions
and legal texts; and second, in the
interpreting of these materials, as
in his famous History of Rome
and in his less known but perhaps
more scholarly work on the history
of Roman law.
During the meeting a number of
anecdotes about Mommsen were
told and photographs were shown,
helping to bring out the individu
ality of the great scholar.
