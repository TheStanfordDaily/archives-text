# Explosion in Physics Building.
## 
### 
The pasoline tank which was
being installed in the basement of
the Physics building exploded this
morning. Workmen of the com
pany which furnished the tank
have been engaged for several
weeks in putting in together. They
were testing it preparatory to turn
ing it over to the University
authorities when the explosion
occurred. The top of the tank,
which is eight feet in height and
five in diameter, was blown off and
every window was shattered by the
concussion. No one was seriously
hurt, although a few minor injuries
were received by the workmen in
the room. The cause of the explo
sion has not vet been determined.
