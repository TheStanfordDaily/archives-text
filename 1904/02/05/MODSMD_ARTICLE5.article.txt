# INDEPENDENTS WILL PLAY.
## Manager Ireland Will Bring a Team to the Campus Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
Stanford will meet the Independ
ents on the Varsity diamond to
morrow afternoon at 8:00 in the
first game of a series of five that
will be played with this team.
Ireland, the manager and captain
of tho Independents, has collected
a number of strong players for this
season. Among the men are three
who have played in the big Eastern
leagues: Streib, who will play left
ffeld tomorrow, was captain of the
Kansas City team last year ; Shay
has been signed by the St. Louis
National League to play short-stop
during the coining season; and
Schmidt played in the outfield of
the Brooklyn team of the National
League in 1903. Lanagan, '00, will
probably be in the box for the
Independents, but should he not
accompany the team. Ferine, who
pitched against the Varsity several
times last year, will take his place.
Ireland will play right field.
The Varsity will probably play
fourteen men in tomorrow's game.
Tritch, Roosevelt, and Sales will
pitch, in the order named. Trow
bridge has been shifted to short
stop from third base, Swain taking
his place, and Williams going to
second.
Wirt will be back in the game
again at center field, as his ankle
has mended sufficiently to allow
him to play. Chalmers and Swain
will be tried at third base, the
latter going into the game first.
The work of both these men will be
watched closely, as they play good
baseball, but are very erratic. Col
bert, who played in right field for
the Varsity during the two previous
games, will be brought in to first
base. Blake will relieve him dur
ing the latter half of the game.
Knight and Moore will each play
part of the game in right field.
Other changes may occur on the
team during the game, as several
of the men are playing such listless
baseball that Coach Doyle is much
dissatisfied.
The teams will lineup as follows:
Independents — Lanagan, pitch
er; Morrison, catcher; Goslinsky,
firßt base; Deheny, second base;
Spencer, third base; Shay, short
stop; Streib, left field; Schmidt,
center field; Ireland, right field.
Stanford —Tritch, Roosevelt, and
Sales, pitcher; Ball, catcher; Col
bert and Blake, first base; Williams,
second base; Swain and Chalmers,
third base; Trowbridge, short-stop;
Stott, left field; Wirt, center field;
Knight and Moore, right field.
