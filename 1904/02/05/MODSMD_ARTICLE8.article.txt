The Combined Musical Clubs
will give a concert in Assembly
Ilall tomorrow night in order to
reduce the deficit that was the
result of their recent trip North.
The Stanford clubs have the de
served reputation of giving a good
entertainment, and the only feature
that makes them anything less
than a brilliant local attraction is
the fact that they have been heard
here frequently in the past. The
concert this year will be varied by
the addition of several new features,
and the program promises to be
most interesting. But more than
that, the college is in duty bound
to support the clubs, for they ac
complish a great deal of good for
Stanford. Perhaps because of
their success, more than any other
one thing, is due the fact that
Stanford has drawn so many
recruits from certain sections of
California. These men show the
University in a favorable light
when they are away, and the stu
dent body should support them
now that they have encountered a
financial reverse.
