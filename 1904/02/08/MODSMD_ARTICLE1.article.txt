# CALIFORNIA WINS MEDAL.
## J.P. Lucey, of Hastings Law School, Carries off the Prize by an Effective Speech. 
### 
The decision of the judges in the
tenth annual Carnot debate, held
at the University of California
Friday night, awarded the medal
to Joseph P. Lucey of Hastings
College of Law. A dissenting vote
among the judges was cast for
Howard M. Lewis of Stanford, but
the majority gave the decision to
Lucy. Harmon gymnasium was
crowded to the doors by partisans
of both colleges. The audience,
however, was to a large degree
composed of constituents of the
Blue and Gold. The decision was
received with satisfaction by all,
for the medal was awarded to the
speaker who clearly deserved the
decision.
The question, announced two
hours before the debate, was '' Re
solved, That the French judiciary
should be made more completely
independent of both the legislative
and executive departments." The
question was far less difficult than
the debaters expected, and this fact
tended to bring the speeches up to
the high degree of excellence with
which they were given. The six
debaters selected sides and order of
speaking as follows: F. A. Mandel,
California, first affirmative ; F.
Roehr, Stanford, first negative; A.
Sherriffs, Stanford, second affirm
ative ; H. M. Lewis, Stanford,
second negative; J. P. Lucey, Cali
fornia, third affirmative; Hart
Greensfelder, California, third neg
ative.
Mandel opened the debate. He
attacked the present close relation
ship of the judiciary to the legisla
tive and executive departments of
the French Government. He
pointed out the future dangers of
this close relationship. At all
times Mandel's delivery was good,
and in his rebuttal speech he put
foward a very ingenious figure,
comparing the French judiciary
system to a railroad sound in all
its parts, but in which there was a
bolt lose in the track.
F. Roehr was the first negative
speaker. He upheld the present
judiciary system, called attention
to the fact that it was old in his
tory, that it had given general
satisfaction to the French people.
Roehr's speech was logical and his
rebuttal dealt directly with the
arguments advanced by the pre
ceding speaker.
Sherriffs continued the affirma
tive. He showed where the present
judiciary system of France inter
fered with the individual liberty of
the French citizen, and advanced
several specific instances that
brought out clearly his point of
view. Sherriffs spoke with much
readiness and force.
H. M. Lewis confined himself to
more detailed argument, although
his general stand was along the
same lines as his colleagues. He
gave historical development of the
present system and referred espec
ially to the satisfaction which it
had given in the past. Lewis re
buttal was effective and his pre
sentation attractive.
