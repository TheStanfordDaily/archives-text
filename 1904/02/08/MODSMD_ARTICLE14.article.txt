# INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE.
## California Representatives Insist That Meeting Be Held in San Francisco. 
### 
The Intercollegiate Debating
Committee, of which the Stanford
members are 0. C. Spencer, '04,
E. W. Rice, '02, and J. F. English,
'01, met at the California Hotel in
San Francisco Saturday night to
make the preliminary arrange
ments for the annual Intercollegi
ate debate with the University of
California. It was decided to hold
the debate at the Alhatnbra Thea
tre in San Francisco on April 23d.
The Stanford representatives pro
posed that the debate should be
held on the campus of each univer
sity alternately, but the California
men would not agree to such a
change. Because of the public
character of the State University,
they contended, something should
be open to the people generally,
and now that all the sports are to
be held on the campuses, the Inter
collegiate debate alone remains to
be held in San Francisco.
The Stanford men won the toss
for the privilege of selecting the
side of the question the Cardinal
will uphold. California, therefore,
will select the question, which must
be submitted two weeks from to
day. After its submission, Stan
ford has one week in which to
select the side her debaters prefer
to defend. The Intercollegiate dif
fers from the Carnot debate in that
it is the work of the whole team
that counts, and the speeches are
not extemporaneous. The team
will be chosen five weeks before
theidebate occurs, and consequently
the members will have ample op
portunity to prepare themselves.
The preliminary try-outs for
places on the team will soon be be
gun. The candidates are numer
ous, and it will take some time to
weed them out. All debaters who
have had a place on a Carnot team
or on a previous Intercollegiate
team may enter the final try-out
without a preliminary test.
