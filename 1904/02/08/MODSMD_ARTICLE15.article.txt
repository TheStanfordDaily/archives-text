# Successful Concert Given by Clubs.
## 
### 
Last Saturday night a large
audience greeted the Musical Clubs
at their return concert in Assem
bly Hall. The program was
highly appreciated and every num
ber was encored until the reserve
fund of songs and specialties had
been exhausted. The songs by the
Glee Club and the selections by
the Mandolin Club, while some of
them were old, were well rendered,
and the new numbers were catchy
and popular.
The specialties were all good.
May and Wilson in their one-act

piece seemed to be the favorites.
The quartette composed of Hooper,
May, Lanagan, and Bush, was also
in high favor. Bush and Baker
were received with the customary
enthusiasm.
The concert realized a profit of
$256.45, the total receipts being
$307.95, and the expenses $51.50.
Arrangements are being made to
give a concert in San Jose as soon
as Perrin, the leader of the Glee
Club, recovers from his present ill
ness. Two or three other places
are now under consideration, but
no definite plan has been decided
upon.
