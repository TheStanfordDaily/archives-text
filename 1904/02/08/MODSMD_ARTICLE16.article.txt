Harry de Windt, the British ex
plorer and author, who will lecture
in Assembly Hall, under the
auspices of the Geological Society,
was originally started on his trav
els by Queen Victoria. He is
probably the most noted explorer
alive today. He is well known all
over Europe, is a Fellow of the
Royal Geographical Society of
Great Britain, and his lecture has
created a sensation abroad. The
subject of his lecture will be his
overland trip from Paris ..to New
York, by way of Siberia and the
the Bering Straits. The illustra
tions, which are remarkable, are by
the Vicomte de Clinchamp, who
was a member of de Windt's expe
dition.
Reserved seats for the lecture are
now on sale at the Bookstore and
at the Stanford Pharmacy in Palo
Alto.
