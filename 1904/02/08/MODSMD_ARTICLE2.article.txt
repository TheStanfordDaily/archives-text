# "ALUMNUS" CHANGES FORM.
## Will Appear Twice a Month.— O.A. Wilson is Editor of Paper. 
### 
The Alumnus appears this week
with a new editor, a new dress, and
new plans. 0. A. Wilson, '04,
takes the iplace of J. T. Burcham,
'97, as editor-in-chief of the paper,
Mr. Burcham having resigned be
cause of pressure of his regular
work. The Alumnus has been
changed from a weekly journal of
large newspaper form to a semi
monthly of magazine form. It
now resembles the alumni papers
of the large Eastern universities,
and it is the purpose of the editor
to follow the policy of those papers
as to the news printed.
The reasons for the change, and
the future policy of the paper, are
explained in the following words of
the editor:
"Ever since the weekly was be
gun it has been apparent to those
most solicitous for the welfare of
the Alumnus that the newspaper
form had to be discarded sooner or
later. The appearance of the four
paged sheet was particularly dis
tasteful to those who expect to see
in the graduates' organ a neatly
gotten up paper in magazine form.
Severe criticism was directed at
the management, but under the
circumstances no betterment has
been possible before the present
time. It was apparent when the
weekly was started last September
that the move was an ambitious
one for Stanford, with its small
body of eighteen hundred gradu
ates, which, compared with the
large alumni strongholds of the big
Eastern colleges, made our plan
extremely questionable and ill
advised. The old paper, however,
filled its field—that of appealing
to those far removed from Stanford;
but to the large hody of undergrad
uates it was constantly losing caste
because of the similarity the news
necessarily bore to that printed
in the Daily Palo Alto. It was
realized that it was absolutely
necessary to bring about a change
whereby the graduating classes
would leave every commencement
with the idea that the Alumnus
was indispensable to them. There
can be no possible reason why
Stanford at the present time needs
a weekly Alumnus. Such a paper
can not be self-supporting, and un
til our graduates increase in num
ber, and interest in the welfare of
the paper grows among the alumni,
a bi-weekly is the only recourse."
I. Russell, '04, and B. C. Dey,
'05, have been added to the board
of editors.
