# HANDICAP TRACK MEET.
## For the First Time This Year Stanford Athletes Compete on Oval. 
### 
On a track which was slow be
cause of the heavy rains of the pre
ceding day and night, the track
candidates met in the first field-day
of the semester Saturday morning.
As a result of the handicap meet
the attention of Trainer Moulton
and Captain Holman has been
called to certain men who are out
for the first time this year, and to
the lack of hurdlers and weight
men. Every effort will be put
forth by the trainer to develop the
hurdling material on hand now,
and to round a few men into shape
for both the high and the low hur
dles.
The feature of the day was
the relay race between two teams of
nine men, who ran a distance of
one mile and a quarter, each set
running 220 yards. The men were
very evenly matched, and it was
only after the hardest struggle that
Freeman, '06, won from his oppo
nent, Alvord, '06, and decided the
most interesting event of the meet.
