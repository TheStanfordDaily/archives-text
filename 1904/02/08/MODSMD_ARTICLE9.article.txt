The growing body of Stanford
alumni has every reason to be in
tensely gratified at the recent
change in the official organ of the
Stanford Alumni Association. The
Alumnus has appeared for the first
time this semester, and for the first
time in many months the college
has reason to feel proud of the
paper that bears her name. There
is nothing in this of disparagement
for the work of the men who have
controlled the fortunes of the Alum
nus in the past. These men have
been handicapped by poor support
on the part of the alumni or by at
tempting to issue a weekly paper
when the numerical strength of the
interested alumni was not great
enough to warrant such a venture.
In its present form, one that closely
corresponds with that of the Cor
nell Alumni News, the Stanford
Alumnus is a clean, well-printed,
well-edited paper. It will be issued
but twice a month, but as it is
double the size in which it was
printed as a weekly it should fully
satisfy the needs of the alumni.
There is little reason to doubt that
the change is a good move. The
Alumnus has hardly been a success
in past years. It has either been
issued so seldom as to be of little
use as a medium of live news, or it
has been forced to present a cheap
appearance in an attempt to come
out more frequently. In its present
form the paper is a credit to the
college; it will appear often enough
to keep the alumni in touch with
the college, and it has a neat and
dignified appearance that is very
gratifying.
