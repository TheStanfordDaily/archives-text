It is to be hoped that the pro
jected track meet with the Univer
sity of Nevada may be definitely
arranged. With the exception of
the annual contest with California
the track meets of Stanford attract
but little attention; and to the fact
that there is but one important
contest, more than to any other, is
due the lack of interest felt in the
track athletics of the college. Ne
vada has proved herself to be a
worthy rival on the football field,
and if she can send forth a track
team that ranks with her eleven
she is entitled to meet either
Stanford or California on the
oval. Owing to the practical
isolation of California and Stan
ford they are almost entirely
dependent upon each other for
all kinds of athletic contests.
If Nevada can be encoantered as a
third rival for intercollegiate hon
ors she will be a welcome addition
to the field, which is too narrow to
furnish complete satisfaction to the
men who train for months in order
to participate in a single event in
the intercollegiate meet.
