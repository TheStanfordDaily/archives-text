Editor Daily Palo Alto:
1 wish to call the attention of the
Junior Class to the condition of the
'05 Quad.
There now remain hut three
weeks in which to pay Quad assess
ments and have pictures taken.
The fact that only ahout half the
class have paid assessments and
less than one-third have had pic
tures taken is certainly discourag
ing to the management. I wish to
inform you that all this work must
be finished by March Ist, and that
there will positively be no sittings
for photographs after that date.
If this matter is postponed until
the last moment some of you will
surely be disappointed. I will he
on the quad all day Thursday, ex
cept during the 11:15 period, to
afford all who have not paid the
assessment the opportunity of so
doing. Reduced rates on picture
privileges in the Quad will he given
only to those who have paid the
assessment. True Van Sickle,
Business Manager '05 Quad.
