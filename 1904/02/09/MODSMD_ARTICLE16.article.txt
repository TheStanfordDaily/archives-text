# Services in Memorial Church.

The Rev. I). Charles Gardner
preached at both morning and
afternoon services in Memorial
Church last Sunday. At the morn
ing service he took for his text
John xiv, 15, "If ye love me, keep
my commandments." He sought
to show that the essence of Chris
tianity is true worship of Jesus
Christ, and by true worship is
meant not mere subscribing to a
creed, nor acting in tlie forms of
religion, but keeping in its spirit.
As the soldier who turns his back
to the enemy is a coward, or he
who betrays the cause is a traitor,
so in Christian life such ones are
hypocrites. A hypocrite is one
who pretends, who clothes with the
cloak of religion his sins.
Hypocrisy dwarfs not only moral
and spiritual life, butcaßts a blight
over all Christian life. Disgust of
spectators for such actions on the
part of professing Christians is
often used as an excuse for holding
aloof from the church.
This judgment, however, is as
unsound as would be one repudi
ating the Constitution of the United
States on account of the corruption
of some of its municipalities.
Many people judge Christianity by
its professors; many do not try it
for themselves. They know the life
and character of Christ and con
trast that ideal with the cowardly
hypocrisy of the unloving Chris
tian of today. But in this they
mistake the shadow for the sub
stance.
Chaplain Gardner did not
attempt to deny the prevalence
of hypocrisy among professing
Christians. It is due to deceit in
the human heart and the super
ficial character of the times. It is
not confined to religion. There is
pretence and acting for politeness
and for custom in every division
of social existence. There is hypoc
risy in dress, where styles are made
for show and not for comfort;
hypocrisy in conversation, for con
ventionality and gossip. Hypocrisy
in religion is often adopted because
church attendance is considered
good form, and gives a social pres
tige and standing. To these people
there is no religion for the daily
life. In an emphasis of creed or
ritual one falls short unless the
spiritual side is likewise empha
sized.
The remedy for this atrophy over
moral and spiritual life is to learn
the true motive for religion. Many
people confuse form with religion
itself, which in its true essence is a
bond between the individual
human soul and God. In Christ's
religion we find motive, and power
to live truly, according to this rela
tion. Christianity is not a form—
it is a passion and desire to serve,
which springs from the heart. One
can never act the hypocrite when
truly reverent. To be a Christian
is not to subscribe to a creed, not
to be a sentimentalist, nor a moral
ist, but to be a manly man rising
against the lower and always striv
ing for the highest.
