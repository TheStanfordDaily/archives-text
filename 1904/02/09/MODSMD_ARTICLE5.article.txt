Encina Hall next Saturday eve
ning, from half-past seven until

terested in the dance was held last
week to talk over the matter of en
gaging carriages. A majority of
the men present at that meeting
were in favor of discontinuing the
custom of hiring carriages for the
dance. President Deliy of Encina
Club was asked t,o appoint a com
mittee to canvass the Hall and
ascertain how many were willing
to walk. The report of this com
mittee was heard at a meeting of
the Board of Directors of Encina
Club last night. It has been de
cided not to hire carriages and that
each man pay $1 into the Encina
Club treasury, the sum total to be
turned over to the Women's Tennis
Club, to be expended on a new
court for the women of the Univer
sity. Only those men who have
invited campus residents to the
dance have entered into this agree
ment. In accordance with this
action, all of the ladies invited who
live on the campus will be asked to
walk to the dance.
