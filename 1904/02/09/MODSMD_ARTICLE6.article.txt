### 
Those who attend DeWindt's
illustrated lecture tomorrow eve
ning, Wednesday, February 1 Oth,
will be both instructed and enter
tained. There is nothing hack
neyed or monotonous about his
story. It is a narrative of explor
ation, rather than of simple travel,
about a large section of Russia of
which almost nothing, in detail, is
known. DeWindt is particularly
well informed on Russia, her re
sources, and the present situation
in Manchuria, so that his lecture
tomorrow night is especially timely
in the light of recent events.
Of the 120 sterecpticon views,
over two-thirds are beautifully
colored, and so add vividness to
the story of the 19,000 mile journey
from Paris to New York by land,
of which 6,000 miles was made
across frozen Asia with dogs and
reindeer. Before leaving the East
he lectured at Princeton, where he
was enthusiastically received.
The lecture will be given in
Assembly Hall and will begin at
8:15. The sale of seats at the
Bookstore and at the Stanford
Pharmacy in Palo Alto is progress
ing rapidly.
