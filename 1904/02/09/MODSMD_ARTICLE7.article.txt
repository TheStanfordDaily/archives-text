# Field Meet Saturday.
## 
### 
The second meet of the Stanford
track team will he held on the
oval on Saturday morning. The
events will be run in the nature of
time trials. The men who are en
tered in the different events will he
divided into sets of three and four,
and the time of each man will he
taken. After the trials have been
run, those men making the best
time will be placed on the rubbing
list, and will thereafter receive
regular attention from the rubbers.
All on the track must run in the
time trials on Saturday, or else
present a reasonable excuse from
the University physican before the
meet. Those athletes who fail to
appear will be asked to leave the
track for the rest of the season.
Trainer Moulton again calls
attention to the fact that training
rules must be observed. Any man
who breaks training rules will be
asked to leave the track imme
diately.
