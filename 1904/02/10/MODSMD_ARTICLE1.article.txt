# DR. WILBUR RESIGNS.
## Will Devote His Time to Practice of Medicine.â€”Definite Plans Unknown. 
### 
Ray Lyman Wilbur, assistant
professor of Physiology and His
tology, has resigned from the Uni
versity faculty in order to devote
his whole time to the practice of
medicine. Dr. Wilbur, who is now
at Frankfort-on-the-Main, in Ger
many, forwarded his resignation to
President Jordan several weeks
ago, and it was accepted. It will
take effect at the expiration of Dr.
Wilbur's leave of absence, which
runs until August next.
Beyond the fact that Dr. Wilbur
intends to follow the practice of
medicine on his own account, little
is known at Stanford of his future
piano. It has been reported that
he has entered into a partnership
with a prominent physician of New
York City, but no confirmation of
this can be secured. It is rather
believed that he will settle in
Palo Alto or San Francisco. Dr.
Wilbur's work in the Physiology
department is now being carried on
by Assistant Professor J. R. Slon
aker, whose connection with the
University began at Christmas.
Dr. Wilbur was graduated from
Stanford University in 1896, and
took his master's degree in 1897.
He then studied at the Cooper
Medical College and took the
degree of doctor of medicine there.
He was for a year instructor and
demonstrator in physiology at
Cooper Medical College. In 1900
he was appointed to the Physiology
department at Stanford. For some
time he was health officer of the
University.
