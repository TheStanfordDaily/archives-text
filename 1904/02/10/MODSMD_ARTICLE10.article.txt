# DISCUSSES ELIGIBILITY RULES.
## College Newspaper Man Writes on the Drawbacks of University Athletics. 
### 
A college man on the staff of
Town Topics, of Cleveland, 0., sign
ing himself "The Referee," writes
interestingly on the subject of eli
gibility rules for college nthletics.
He takes the position that the chief
drawback in university athletics,
the cause of whatever ill-feeling
and unsportsmanlike conduct
which arises, is the lack of uniform
eligibility rules. The agreements
and rules thus far formulated have
been failures, he contends, because
of their elasticity and ambiguity,
and their obvious effort to please
everybody. What is needed, he
argues, is a uniform set of rules,
clearly worded and capable of only
one interpretation, and these backed
by a wholesome, vigorous sentiment
of alumni, undergraduates, and
general public.
"The trouble with all these theo
ries and precepts on how college
athletics should be conducted is,
unfortunately, that they are of
difficult application," says the
Cornell Alumni News. "Practical
obstacles interfere, and conditions
often fail to prove favorable. For
instance, had we now the whole
some and vigorous sentiment for
which he clamors, there would be
today no difficulty as to eligibility
rules and none of the conditions
against which he inveighs.
"It is interesting to note ' The
Referee's ' plan, which in brief is as
follows: 'Let the athletic associa
tions of Yale, Harvard, Princeton,
Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Colum
bia appoint one representative each,
who is a resident of New York.
Let these gentlemen serve as a pre
liminary committee. They can go
over the entire list of Eastern uni
versities and assign each to one of
their respective athletic associa
tions for the next step of the work.
It shall then be the duty of the
several associations to call upon
the colleges on their lists for a code
of eligibility rules which they con
sider equitable and for the best in
terests of college sport. With the
replies of the smaller colleges before
them, each of the six associations
shall submit the suggestions re
ceived in the form of one set of
rules, also submitting separately
any unique suggestions. From
these six codes and added sugges
tions the committee shall formulate
a single code and submit it to a
second committee of six from the
same institutions, the latter repre
sentatives being delegated with the
power to amend the submitted ma
terial, and then to cast a vote of
adoption which shall be binding
upon their respective institutions
and, through them, upon the other
institutions assigned to them on
the original lists. It is also safe to
predict that the rules finally adopt
ed by such a committee would be
eminently fair to the majority, and
that the combined opinion of col
lege men would create an influence
bo powerful that no institution
would court the blacklisting conse
quent on infractions'.'
"For an eligibility clause he sug
gests the following:
" 'No student shall represent a
college or university who has pre
viously matriculated at or been in
attendance at another institution
giving or qualified to give a recog
nized degree. No student shall
represent a college or a university
until he shall have been a resident
student at the said college or uni
versity for a period of one academic
and calendar year —the said aca
demic year being understood to
begin with the date of opening of
college for the said year and to end
with the last of the final examina
tions of the said year. No student
shall represent a college or univer
sity unless his class standing shall
have the written approval of the
faculty of said institution through
an authorized representative, and
no student shall represent a given
institution for more than four
years, said period to date from his
first academic year of representa
tion and end with the close of the
third academic year consecutively
following.'
"This clause undoubtedly strikes
at the root of some of the most
serious evils," the News goes on to
say. "For this reason it merits
careful consideration, even though
in many individual cases it would
fleem to work great injustice. The
rare injustices done would be out
weighed by the fairness to the ma
jority and the added respect ac
corded college athletics by all in
terested in their welfare. It would
debar freshmen, but few freshmen
reap an advantage from the physi
cal, mental, and moral strain
attendant upon a season with a
varsity team. Of more importance,
however —it would practically elim
inate the offering of inducements to
boys to adopt an athletic college
career."

"The trouble with all these theo
ries and precepts on how college
athletics should be conducted is,
unfortunately, that they are of
difficult application," says the
Cornell Alumni News. "Practical
obstacles interfere, and conditions
often fail to prove favorable. For
instance, had we now the whole
some and vigorous sentiment for
which he clamors, there would be
today no difficulty as to eligibility
rules and none of the conditions
against which he inveighs.
"It is interesting to note ' The
Referee's ' plan, which in brief is as
follows: 'Let the athletic associa
tions of Yale, Harvard, Princeton,
Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Colum
bia appoint one representative each,
who is a resident of New York.
Let these gentlemen serve as a pre
liminary committee. They can go
over the entire list of Eastern uni
versities and assign each to one of
their respective athletic associa
tions for the next step of the work.
It shall then be the duty of the
several associations to call upon
the colleges on their lists for a code
of eligibility rules which they con
sider equitable and for the best in
terests of college sport. With the
replies of the smaller colleges before
them, each of the six associations
shall submit the suggestions re
ceived in the form of one set of
rules, also submitting separately
any unique suggestions. From
these six codes and added sugges
tions the committee shall formulate
a single code and submit it to a
second committee of six from the
same institutions, the latter repre
sentatives being delegated with the
power to amend the submitted ma
terial, and then to cast a vote of
adoption which shall be binding
upon their respective institutions
and, through them, upon the other
institutions assigned to them on
the original lists. It is also safe to
predict that the rules finally adopt
ed by such a committee would be
eminently fair to the majority, and
that the combined opinion of col
lege men would create an influence
bo powerful that no institution
would court the blacklisting conse
quent on infractions'.'
"For an eligibility clause he sug
gests the following:
" 'No student shall represent a
college or university who has pre
viously matriculated at or been in
attendance at another institution
giving or qualified to give a recog
nized degree. No student shall
represent a college or a university
until he shall have been a resident
student at the said college or uni
versity for a period of one academic
and calendar year —the said aca
demic year being understood to
begin with the date of opening of
college for the said year and to end
with the last of the final examina
tions of the said year. No student
shall represent a college or univer
sity unless his class standing shall
have the written approval of the
faculty of said institution through
an authorized representative, and
no student shall represent a given
institution for more than four
years, said period to date from his
first academic year of representa
tion and end with the close of the
third academic year consecutively
following.'
"This clause undoubtedly strikes
at the root of some of the most
serious evils," the News goes on to
say. "For this reason it merits
careful consideration, even though
in many individual cases it would
fleem to work great injustice. The
rare injustices done would be out
weighed by the fairness to the ma
jority and the added respect ac
corded college athletics by all in
terested in their welfare. It would
debar freshmen, but few freshmen
reap an advantage from the physi
cal, mental, and moral strain
attendant upon a season with a
varsity team. Of more importance,
however —it would practically elim
inate the offering of inducements to
boys to adopt an athletic college
career."
