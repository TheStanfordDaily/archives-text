The scheme of arranging a num
ber of regattas among the different
organizations in college for the
early boating season is a highly
commendable one. Boating is a
sport that is in its infancy at Stan
ford,and anything that will arouse
a greater general interest and bring
out a larger number of candidates
is to be encouraged. The inter-fra
ternity baseball games have prob
ably done little to train men for
the Varsity; but baseball is a
firmly established sport,and every
one who is a Varsity possibility is
well aware of that fact. This is
is not the case in regard to rowing.
There may be many men in the
different organizations in college
possessing the elements of future
Varsity crew men, who, through
lack of confidence, might hang
back from trying for the Varsity,
and nevertheless would willingly
participate in a race in which their
club or society was entered.
Should they be arranged, the races
would probably not be remarkable
as aquatic contests, but they would
arouse interest in the sport and
call out a larger number of candi
dates for the crew, and so they are
to be encouraged in every possible
way.
