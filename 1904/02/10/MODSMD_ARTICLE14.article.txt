The communication that appears
in another column of this paper
touches upon a matter that has at
tracted hut little attention in the
college in spite of the fact that it is
of the widest importance. The
fact that the University is not
keeping a daily history is of little
moment to us who are living in the
light of current events. But to the
classes that will he at Stanford ten
or twenty years from now the side
lights 011 the history of to
day, which might he cast by a
collection of clippings, will lie miss
ing. These classes will he forced
to rely for information on the un
certain memory of old Stanford

men, or on the limited columns of
the Daily Palo Alto. The reas
ons for keeping the clippings are
manifold and plainly evident; the
question is, How can we raise the
money in order to be retained on
the subscription list of a clipping
agency?
