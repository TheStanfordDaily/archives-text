Editor Daily Palo Alto:
From the date of Dr. Jordan's
appointment as President of the
institution, down to a little after
the intercollegiate field meet a year
ago, this University seems to have
been on the subscription list of a
certain clipping agency which for
the time between those dates sup
plied us with newspaper cuttings
comprising practically every men
tion of Stanford made in any paper
published in this country. The
clippings were carefully preserved
with something like chronological
order in big scrap-books, and twen
ty such volumes are now on file in
the University Library. They con
tain all manner of information
concerning the University; there
is a full report of its building and
dedication, of the first class organ
ization, and of the first student
body organization, of the vineyard
and fiat-car escapades of those
"days of '91." There is a full
account of every athletic event of
any sort from that first forgotten
football game played in San Jose
in 1891 between the "Stanford and
Berkeley gymnasiums," down to
the track victory of 1903 â€”and
there the record stops. The sub
scription was allowed to discon
tinue. A little investigation seems
to disclose that we owe the twenty
volumes we have to the charity of
the company which carried us for
all those years on the free list; and
now that we are dropped, the sixty
dollars annually that a continua
tion would cost us is not forthcoming
from any quarter.
Stanford is thus permitting an
irreparable break to occur in one
of the most valuable sources for
the future compilation of her his
tory. Newspapers are destroyed
almost as soon as printed, and
clippings can not be had except
immediately after their appearance.
The loss we are sustaining, thanks
to the discontinuance of our sub
scription, is already considerable,
and can never be wholly recov
ered. While a newspaper account
of an event is rarely its true com
plete history, a collection of such
accounts gives the history as the
public knew it, and, at the very
lowest estimate, is always a valu
able side-light upon the facts
themselves. From the clipping
books alone it is possible to recon
struct a fair sketch of Stanford life
for any given year between 1891
and 1903. It would be interesting
to compare such a newspaper his
tory with the best the actors them
selves might be able to write,
relying as they must almost
entirely on memory. Both accounts
would be liable to omission and
error; each would benefit by com
parison with the other, and neither
could be complete alone. Yet per
haps the clipping record would be
the nearer so. It is the lack of the

clipping-book assistance which is
going to make it difficult for an
English Club ten years from now
to reconstruct the times of 1904,
events of which the classes of 1915
and 1916 may find as interesting as
we do the clipping-book story of
the first political rebellion and the
secession of the Pioneers en masse,
or the first question as to the
success of coeducation which arose
seriously when Roble nicely decid
ed that her month's acquaintance
with Encina did not warrant an
acceptance of the first invitation to
dance. Certainly a glance will
convince the curious that the Uni
versity scrap-books are interesting
reading. Some action should be
taken to continue the subscription.
