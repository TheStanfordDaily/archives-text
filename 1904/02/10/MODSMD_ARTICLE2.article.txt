Work on the new courts, which
have been laid out on either side of
the old court in front of Encina
Hall, has been progressing rapidly.
The recent rain has packed the
clay thoroughly, so that after sev
eral rollings the courts will he
ready for the oil. F. A. Leib. '02,
who has charge of the building of
the new courts, will rush the
sprinkling of the oil when the
ground is thoroughly packed. The
hack-stops of the old court have
been placed to the rear several feet
and the new back-stops will be
erected on a line with the new po
sition of the old ones.
The new courts will be ready for
use about March Ist. Until that
date all of the players will be
forced to use the old court. Baker,
'04, and Hodge, '06, have been out
for light practice several times. If
the weather remains good general
practice will begin next week.
