# ACTIVITY IN BOATING.
## Plans for Rowing Regattas Among Various Organizations Now Under Way. 
### 
The coming season of boating on
Lagunita promises to be more
eventful than was at first antici
pated by those most earnest in the
advancement of that sport at Stan
ford. Within two weeks the boat
house will have been moved and
all other rearranging and repairing
will have been completed. The
lake is filling steadily and will
have a sufficient body of water to
receive the boats as soon as they
are in shape. The two new pair
oared boats are due to arrive
March Ist. A scheme that will
almost surely meet with the ap
proval of the organizations for
which it is intended has been ad
vanced by Professor A. W. Smith,
who will have general direction of
the boating during the coming sea
son. The plan is to organize a
series of interfraternity races, and
races between Encina Club and
other organizations. The idea will
be very similar to the baseball
series that is now being played
among the fraternities. These
races can be putin charge of a
committee and the complete sched
ule carried out without difficulty.
If the scheme is adopted the pre
liminary series will afford rowing
contests until the first part of May,
when the interclass regattas will
be held.
