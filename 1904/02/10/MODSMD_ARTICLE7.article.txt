# BASEBALL PRACTICE.
## Men Resume Work on Diamond After Several Days of Inactivity. 
### 
The baseball squad appeared for
practice yesterday for the first time
since the middle of last week. The
field was soft and made the play
ing very slow. Coach Doyle prac
ticed the squad at fielding and
then called in a number of men for
batting practice. It is from this
squad that the Varsity will largely
be composed. The men who
formed it last night were: Ball,
Sales, Tritch, Blake, Moore, Wil
liams, Trowbridge, Kelly, Chal
mers, Morrow, Wirt, and Knight.
The team has suffered a blow in
the loss of Colbert, who left for his
home in the East today. Colbert
was a strong candidate for this
year's Varsity at either first base
or right field. He was good in the
field and hit well.
After the batting practice the
men took the different positions
they are trying for on the team.
Ball was behind the bat, Moore
and Blake played first base, and
Williams was on second, taking
the place Swain has played in the
two Varsity games. Trowbridge
has been moved from third to
short-stop, and played the latter
position last night. Kelly and
Chalmers were on third base, and
Swain, who was not on the field
last night, is also being practiced
for this position. Wirt, Knight,
and Morrow were trying in the
outfield.
Training rules went into effect
for the baseball squad on last Mon
day. This is the first time strict
training has been insisted upon for
baseball men at Stanford, and the
experiment is expected to prove
beneficial.
The Varsity has played two
games, won one and lost one, and
has seven more scheduled games to
play before the first intercollegiate
contest in April. Of the remain
ing games, four are with Santa
Clara, and three with the Indepen
dents. The next Varsity game will
be played on Saturday afternoon
with Santa Clara.
