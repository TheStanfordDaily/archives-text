# SWORD AND SANDALS.
## Dramatic Organization of University Reorganized and New Members Elected. 
### 
A meeting of Sword and Sandals
was held on the quad yesterday,
with the purpose in view of reor
ganizing the club. The dramatic
organization, Sword and Sandals,
was founded in 1898, and most
prominent among the old members
were W. M. Erb, ex-'Ol, L. M. Bow
man, '01, W. H. Irwin, '00, C. M.
Bradley, '01, J. S. Briscoe, '00, J.
F. Lanagan, '00, and W. Young,
ex-'O4. It was the custom of the
club to present a farce once a year.
For several years the club has
existed merely in name, having
taken no active part as an organi
zation in the dramatics at Stan
ford. The meeting yesterday was
attended by the following men, who
are actively concerned in the reor
ganization : C. H. Baker, '04, R.
V. Anderson,'o4, F. H. Fowler,'o4,
L. D. Byrne, '05, H. R. Johnson,
'04, H. E. Bush, '05, and E. R.
May, '06.
The reoganization of Sword and
Sandals is planned in order to fill
the need felt for some club which
will exercise an unofficial control
of the dramatics of the University.
For the past few years there has
been no organization which has
taken charge of theatricals at Stan
ford, and as a result dramatics
have suffered. If the club can be
put on the proper basis, its mem
bers are confident that the organi
zation will work for the welfare
of the dramatics of the University.
No definite plans have been
made, but it is highly probable
that the newly organized club will
present a play before the end of the
term. The following men were
elected members: 11. G. Harnett,
'04, M. H. Thorpe, '05, I). D. Sales,
'06, and 1). R. Wilson, '06.
