If Sword and Sandals is success
ful in its attempt to place itself on
a substantial footing and exert a
real influence over the dramatics
of the University, it will be a good
thing for Stanford. There have
been, during the last four or five
years, a number of farces and
comedies staged at Stanford that
were a disgrace to the community.
The good play, well staged, care
fully rehearsed and well acted, has
been a most welcome exception. At
present there is no means by which
one can tell whether a performance
will be good or bad until he has
witnessed it. There is no organi
zation in the University whose
word can place a sanction of ap
proval on a play before it has been
presented. The Faculty Music
Committee does that for the class
of performances in which it is
interested, and there is no reason
that a student organization could
not fill the same province in regard
to the dramatics of the University.
Sword and Sandals can not do this
at the present time, for it has
seldom taken an active part in our
theatricals, as an organization, and
it is not recognized as having a
right to say, "this is good and
should be encouraged," or "that is
bad and should be put down." But
let the organization show signs of
being interested in the dramatic
field; let it inquire into the merits
of a coming play, and the ability of
the actors; let it give a play of its
own —in other words, let it do some
thing to show that it is more than a
name —and it will be recognized
generally, and can exercise an in
fluence on the dramatics of the
University. There are a number
of organizations that are little more
than names at Stanford, and Sword
and Sandals of late years has been
included in this list. The men
who are members today are to be
encouraged in any plans they may

have in mind to increase the field
of their activities. There is need
for an active dramatic organization
here, and there is no reason that
Sword and Sandals can not fill
this place and be recognized as an
unofficial authority on our theatri
cal affaire.
