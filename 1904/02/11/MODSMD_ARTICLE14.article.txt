# Will Recite from " Les Miserables."
## 
### 
A recital from Victor Hugo's
"Les Miserables" will be given at
the University Tuesday evening,
February 16th, by Mr. Montaville
Flowers. Mr. Flowers is now in
Southern California giving read
ings from this novel and from
Shakspere's "Hamlet" and"The
Merchant of Venice." Although
his style of delivery and method of
treating his subject differ somewhat
from that of Mr. Clark, who de
lighted his audience here last year
with his reading of ''Ulysses,'' Mr.
Flowers' interpretations are no less
pleasing and effective.
In speaking of the work of Mr.
Flowers, Dr. F. \V. Gunsaulus of
Chicago says:"This work you are
in is magnificent. It is creative
and formative. I am not certain
that you do hot hold the solution
of the question of the theatre for
cultured people. The time may
come when the tastes of the people
will ke so educated bv interpretive
recitals that they will demand
higher and better work of the
stage."
Gen. Lew Wallace says: "Mr.
Flowers' work has my approval.
It is the revival of the ancient
Eastern ciffctotn of story-telling. It
is a recreation of a lost art. It is
in safe hands with this young man,
and will prove an attractive form
of high-class platform work. I
wish him great success."
