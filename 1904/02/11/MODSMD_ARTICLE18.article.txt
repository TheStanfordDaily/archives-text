# Permanent Band Stand.
## 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students held its regu
lar weekly meeting last night.
M. H. Thorpe, '05, director of the
Band, asked the committee to pro
vide funds for the construction of a
permanent, movable band stand
which may be used for the quad
promenade concerts, the first of
which will be given on February
26th. It was estimated that such
a stand would cost about $60,
which sum would be covered in
time by rent that might be charged
the classes or other organizations
which would use it, and which are
now compelled to build a tempor
ary one very frequently. The
stand proposed would be in sec
tions and easily transportable, and
would be used at the intercollegi
ate baseball and football games.
Thorpe and the student body treas
urer were instructed to secure plans
and definite figures.
