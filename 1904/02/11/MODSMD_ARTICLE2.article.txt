# Freshmen to Meet Santa Rosa.
## 
### 
Treasurer Cowden has received
word from the manager of the
Santa Rosa high school track team
that he accepts March 12th as the
date for a field meet with the Fresh
men. This is the first meet sched
uled for the Freshmen during the
present season. Santa Rosa has
some good material, and will bring
a number of strong athletes to the
meet next month. The Freshmen
have not developed sufficiently to
give any idea of their strength, but
Trainer Moulton will put forth
every effort to have them in good
condition for the meet.
