# DE WINDT LECTURES.
## Famous Explorer Talks of His Overland Trip from Paris to New York. 
### 
Harry de Windt, the Siberian
explorer, delivered an interesting
lecture last night in Assembly
Hall, on his experiences in the Far
North, and the kinds and condi
tions of people whom he met on his
journey, lie Windt has a pleasing
delivery, and his descriptions were
illustrated by the use of stereopti
con views from photographs taken
while en route.
The speaker, in referring to the
object of his trip, said that he was
attempting to prove that a journey
from Paris to New York is possible
without an ocean voyage. He out
lined the course which had been
followed, and gave views of the
principal cities of Europe which
lay along the route from Paris to
Moscow, where the party took the
trans-Siberian railway.
Upon leaving the railway the
hard part of the journey began.
The party traveled on sleds for
practically the remainder of the
trip. At Yakutsk was found an
exile post, the wretchedness of
which is indescribable. Some of
the natives of this place are enor
mously rich from trading in furs.
Their language is almost exactly
that of the Turks. Here the people
become blind after forty years of
age on account of the brightness of
the snow. There is but one doctor
for the 8,000 inhabitants, who are
forced to rely on their own reme
dies. Their ordinary treatment for
blindness is the continual applica
tion of tobacco juice.
Leaving Yakutsk, they pushed on
to the north, using the frozen river
Lena as a road. Filthy little rest
houses were found about every
three hundred miles. At Verko
yansk they found the temperature
seventy-eight degrees below zero.
Another convict prison is stationed
here.
Steering entirely by compass
and the stars, the party headed
through pathless wastes and enor
mous distances for Sredni-kolvmsk.
It was not the cold but the terrible
silence that was oppressive.
Twenty-nine reindeer were lost on
this trip. At Sredni-kolymsk is
the worst prison in all Siberia. Of
the fourteen exiles there, eleven are
hopelessly insane. Only two are
j guilty of actual crime. One of
them is a former college professor,
whose only offense was that a cop}'
of Herbert Spencer's works was
found in his room. Several others
were noted journalists, exiled for
political reasons. The members of
De Windt's party were the first
outsiders to enter the place for
thirty years. The food allotted to
the convicts is insufficient, and
they are forced to catch fish in
order to exist. Famine was raging
at the time De Windt arrived.
The party pushed on, and after
terrible hardships, during the last
three days of which there was nei
ther fuel or food, arrived at the set
tlement of Tchuktchi Indians for
which they had been aiming. The
little village was afflicted with
smallpox, but proved a haven of
rest to the exhausted travelers.

Here they obtained enough food to
enable them to continue down the
Arctic beach to the Bering Straits,
where they were the guests of an
Indian settlement until the arrival
of the Thetis, which landed them
on the American side at Cape
Prince of Wales.
During the journey, sixty rein
deer and fifty-seven dogs died from
exhaustion. The party had trav
eled by sled 6,000 miles from the
trans-Siberian railroad, and had
accomplished the purpose with
which De Windt set out.
