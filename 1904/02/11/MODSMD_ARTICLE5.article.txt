# DINNER TO DEBATERS.
## Carnot Men Entertained by Dr. Duniway.â€” Discussion of Debate. 
### 
The three Carnot debaters, F.
Roehr, '04, H. M. Lewis, '04, and
A. Sherriffs, '05, were the guests of
Associate Professor Duniway of the
History department at a dinner at
his home last evening. Later in
the evening the. members of the
class in Oral Debate also called at
Dr. Duniway's, and the last debate
was talked over. Dr. Duniway
is a member of the faculty com
mittee which manages the debates.
Since the contest of last Friday
there has been much discussion
among Stanford debaters of the
present conditions which govern
the Carnot contest. The primary
idea of the present system of not
giving out the definite question un
til two hours before the debate
actually begins, is to make the
work of the men entirely extem
poraneous. It has been found,
however, that the tendency is for
the debater, in his preparation, to
pick out some phases of the gen
eral question from which he thinks
it likely that the specific question
will be chosen, and to prepare al
most a set speech upon each one of
these. If he happens to have hit
upon the right question, he has
merely to give this prepared speech,
so that the less fortunate guesser is
placed at a great disadvantage, for
liis work must be really extempo
raneous. Under the present sys
tem this situation seems bound to
exist, and the advisability there
fore of a change in the conditions
of the debate, is being talked of
among the men interested in the
subject.
The present system of withhold
ing the exact question' has been
used during the past two years,
one hour being allowed for final
preparation last year, and two
hours this year. Prior to this, the
system of announcing the definite
question, but leaving the choice of
sides to the last minute, was tried.
Other plans also have been tried,
but none found entirely satisfac
tory. What action will be taken,
if any, is not known. So far, there
has been nothing beyond discus
sion.
