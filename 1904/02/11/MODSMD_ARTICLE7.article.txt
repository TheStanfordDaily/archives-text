# FEWER MEN OUT.
## Baseball Practice Still Poor.â€” Candidates Fighting for Positions on Varsity. 
### 
Since the last class game has
been played the number of men
appearing for practice on the dia
mond has diminished very materi*
ally, and the squad now numbers
about twenty-four men. It is the
plan of Captain Ball and Coach
Doyle to have a squad of this num
ber on the field every night, as
about that number can be given a
chance to play during the after
noon.
Yesterday the first practice game
between the Varsity and second
team took place, and the playing
was poor, especially in throwing to
the bases. In the games with the
first and second teams that will
now take place every afternoon
the men will be given a chance to
play at the different positions they
are trying for. The second team,
with a Varsity pitcher in the box,
should prove a good opponent for
the Varsity until the players have
had another month of practice.
Several men are trying for each
position on the Varsity, and it is
probable that changes may take
place before the season is over.
Ball, '04, and Daily, '07, are try
ing for the position of catcher, and
Sales, Roosevelt, and Tritch for su
premacy in the pitcher's box.
Since Colbert has left college, the
candidates for first base number
three: Moore, '05, Blake, '04, and
Mathews, '05. Williams, '06,
Weinmann, '06, and Funke, '05,
are candidates for second base.
Three freshmen, Chalmers, Kelly,
and Swain, are contesting for third
base. Trowbridge, '05, and Dehy,
'04, are playing at short-stop.
There are nine men trying out for
positions in the field: Knight, '04,
i Stott, J O7, Hudson, '06, Wirt, '06,
Morrow, '07, Howard, '06, Knapp,
'04, McComish, '04, and llhyne, '07.
A game has been arranged for
the Varsity with an army team
j from the Presidio, to take place
probably next month.
