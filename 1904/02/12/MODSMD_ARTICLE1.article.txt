# RAIN PREVENTS BASEBALL.
## Varsity Will Not Play Santa Clara Tomorrow.â€”Track Meet Will Be Postponed. 
### 
On account of the unusually
heavy rain, the baseball game with
Santa Clara College and the field
day on the oval have been called
off. The diamond and the track
have been made so soft that noth
ing can be done on them until they
have had ample time to dry out.
The present rain is the heaviest of
the season, and if it continues for
any length of time it is liable to
have a serious effect upon the work
of the baseball and track men.
The actual practice on the dia
mond last week was confined to
two days, and then the field was so
bad that the work was of little
value. The most serious detriment
is the necessary postponement of
the match games on Saturdays.
These games afford the best means
by which the captain and the
coach may judge the work of the
different candidates, and in the
absence of them there is little oppor
tunity for comparison. A man's
play in a match game may differ
entirely from his work in practice,
and consequently his work in the
games is the only safe meaiiB of
estimation of his true ability.
The delay in the work of the
track men is not so serious this
year as it has been in the past,
because the track has beensoim-j
proveu that it sheds the water
readily. The south end of the
track, which was almost useless
during the whole rainy season last
year, has been rebuilt, a large
amount of the old and soft clay
being removed and better dirt
being put in its place, with a per
ceptible banking, so that this sec
tion is now in good condition. The
back stretch of the track has also
been rolled and improved to such
an extent that nothing less than
a flood can permanently injure it.
The training of the track men is
done at all times of the day, and
most of them are able to get out
between showers for their daily
run.
