# Preparations for Debate.
## 
### 
Final arrangements are now
being made for the debate between
the Alameda high school and the
Commercial Evening school of San
Francisco for the challenge cup
offered by the Associated Students
of Stanford University. The ques
tion to be debated will probably be
on the adaptability of the present
system of democratic government
in France to the French people.
The question has not yet been defi
nitely fixed.
The Stanford cup was offered by
the student body some years ago
for the purpose of stimulating in
terest in debating among the high
schools and preparatory schools
embraced in the Central California
Debating League. Every year this
league has try-outs, and the team
that wins out in these has the priv
ilege of trying for the cup against
the team which holds it. The team
which first wins the cup three
times may keep it permanently.
The winner last year was Alameda,
which defeated Lodi.
The debate this year will proba
bly be held in Assembly Hall. The
chapel was found inadequate last
j year to hold the crowd which at
tended, and it is expected that the
attendance will be greater than
ever. Several hundred supporters
of the two teams will probably
come down to encourage their men,
and the attendance of undergradu
ates at these debates is always
large.
