The recent rains have severely
handicapped both the track ath
letes and the baseball players in
their attempt to round into Var
sity form. Stanford has suffered a
heavy setback in the progress that
under normal conditions she should
have made. But there is no reason
that this fact should do anything
but call forth renewed efforts on
the part of the men in training, or
should arouse anything but a
deeper feeling of loyalty and sup
port on the part of the student
body. If Stanford is to win in the
intercollegiate athletic contests of
the semester she must put forth her
best efforts, and the things which
appear to be handicaps should be
welcomed as offering difficulties to
be overcome. There is the proper
spirit at work here now, and every
one must keep at it hard, and all
of the time, to see that this spirit
grows instead of dies away.
