# Game May Be Played.
## 
### 
In case the rain stops and the
diamond is dry enough for play,
the game between the Varsity and
Santa Clara will be played as
scheduled at 3 in the afternoon. If
the diamond is too wet to admit of
playing, the team will probably
make a trip to Santa Clara and
play there. Baseball men are ex
pected to see the student body
treasurer tomorrow morning and
find out what will be done.
