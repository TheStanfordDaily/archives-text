### 
The first two cases of the con
signment of exhibits recently se
cured in India by Mrs. Stanford
have arrived at the Museum and
are bting putin place. The greater
part of the material is from Co
lombo, India. It consists of metal
work, ebony and ivory carvings,
embroideries, costumes, fans, mats,
and baskets.
The metal work includes a beau
tifully wrought repouss6 silver
bowl from Swami Kattragam,
Ceylon. It is girdled with a scene
of the chase, showing the dangers
attendant upon big game hunting.
Another piece is a metal vase of
Paumben work, made of alternate
bands of brass and copper, artis
tically embossed and engraved in
Buddhistic designs and Swami fig
ures. Another is a bowl of enam
eled Jaipore work. Other metal
pieces of interest are three large
cobra candlesticks and a box of
mosaic turquoise work.
The ebony carvings are mainly
of the sacred Ceylonese elephants.
There is a small ebony chest, cov
ered with fine ivory scroll-work.
Two odd examples of native work
manship are boxes made of ebony,
ivory, and porcupine quills, and a
Tag Mahl Agra model showing the
Indian method of travel.
Among the textiles are a number
of fine hand-made embroideries of
various colors in gold and silver
thread, a few specimens of native
dress, and several tapestry mats.
One of the two most valuable
pieces of the entire collection is a
Koran, which Mrs. Stanford se
cured from a Buddhist temple at
Kandy, Ceylon. It is written with
a stylus on leaves of the talliput
palm, which blossoms but twice
in a century. The • other, and
probably the most interesting spec
imen, is an enormous matrix opal
presented by Thomas Wei ton
Stanford, which as far as is known
is the largest in the United States.
It measures three and one-half by
three inches on the face. The
colors run from a fiery red through
all the shades of the spectrum to a
deep azure blue. A special mount
will be made for it so that all sides
may be seen.
