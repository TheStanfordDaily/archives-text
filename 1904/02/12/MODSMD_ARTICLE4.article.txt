The committees that will have

year have been announced by the
class president. There are three
committees. The farce committee

which will be given the evening
before Junior Day. The Junior
Day committee will supervise the
exercises on Junior Day, which
generally consist of the interclass
field-meet in the morning and a
baseball game in the afternoon.
