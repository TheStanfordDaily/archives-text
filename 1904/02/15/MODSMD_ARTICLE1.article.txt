own, and is one of his strongest
readings. General Lew Wallace
says of his interpretation;
"It was a most excellent arrange
ment of 'Ben Hur,' and Mr. Flow
ers displayed splendid judgment in
his adaptation. It meets with my
hearty approval. His elocution
ary power is admirably suited to
the work. He presents the scenes
and incidents of the plot in a
charming manner, and his work in
the presentation was by far the
best I have ever heard."
Bishop John W. Holt says:
"Your work in 'Ben Hur' is simply
magnificent. I will commend you
to all our colleges."
William B. Mellieh of Ohio
speaks of his work as follows: "So
far as the artistic merits of Mr.
Flowers are concerned I can assure
you they are of the highest order.
His 'Ben Hur' is the greatest re
cital of its kind I have ever heard."
The recital will be given in the
University chapel at 7:45. Admis
