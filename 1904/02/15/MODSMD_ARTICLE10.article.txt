# Interclass Handball.
## 
### 
The entries for the doubles of the
handball tournament must be in
before Friday of this week. Any
one is eligible for this tournament,
but each team must be composed of
men of the same class. The teams
of one class will play together first,
and then the respective class cham
pions will meet to decide the
championship of the University. A
partial drawing of the names
handed in will be made before
Friday, and the results of the
drawing will be posted in En
cina gymnasium on Friday. It is
hoped that in this way some of the'
matches may be played on
the coming Saturday, and so the
tournament may be hastened.
