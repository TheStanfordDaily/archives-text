The report of Dean George E.
Vincent, of the college department
of the University of Chicago, to
President Harper, of the university,
is of interest to the members of
all colleges where coeducation has
been or is being experimented with.
About a year ago at Chicago, segre
gation was instituted, much to the
chagrin of the believers in coedu
cation. The unofficial consensus
of opinion which has just been
gathered by Dean Vincent from
members of the faculty approves
the change. Professor Clark
Chandler, who has taught segregat
ed Latin classes, states that there
has been better concentration, and
the students have accomplished
more than under the old system. —
