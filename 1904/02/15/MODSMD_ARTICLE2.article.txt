# Encina Club "At Home."
## 
### 
The dance given by the members
of Encina Club last Saturday
night was one of the most success
ful given for several years. The
success, in a great measure, is due
to the work of the president of the
club and to the social committee,
who put forth every effort to per
fect arrangements. A large num
ber of guests were invited by the
club, and an unusually large num
ber of Hall men went to the dance.
The Hall was very prettily deco
rated in red and white streamers.
Ferns and palms were used pro
fusely. There were sixteen regular
dances and two extras. The music
was furnished by Yanke's orchestra,
of San Francisco. The dance on
Saturday night was the last that
will be given by Encina Club this
year.
