The Rev. E. Bradford Leavitt, of
the First Unitarian Church, San
Francisco, preached at the morning
service in Memorial Church Sun
day. He took for his text Judges
xvii, 13, "Then said Micah, now
know I that the Lord will do me
good, seeing I have a Levite for my
priest." Dr. Leavitt compared the
mistake of Micah with that of
many modern worshippers, and
drew his lesson from that. Micah
lived upon Mount Ephraim, and
according to the custom of the
country built a chapel, in which he
placed his son as priest. A
young Levite passed that way and
Micah, by offering to pay him, in
duced him to stay and assume the
office. The Levites were the tra
ditional priests of the Israelites,
and so had great prestige as spirit
ual leaders. Micah supposed that
the mere fact that a Levite priest
was in the chapel would in itself be
the means of blessing him, in spite
of his former wayward life.
Like all magnificent falsehoods,
this one has its great truths. Ev
ery Levite because of his race is
not qualified to be a means of bless
ing any more than every minister
by virtue of his occupation is qual
ified today. Nevertheless, because
he is the ideal man on account of
his training, people imagine he is
more keen-sighted. And it should
always be so. Micah's mistake
was in supposing that good would
come from the fact that a conven
tional priest was present. Anyone
with the true spirit will bless, how
ever ordained; and no one without
that spirit can bless,even if he does
come from the ideal type. The
later flight of Micah's priest for a
higher pecuniary inducement shows
this.
Many of the churches of today
secure edifying preachers and seek
to please, in a material manner.
The true church of God blesses the
earth, but the other is a club of
Pharisees. By creed-twisted texts
and barren sectarianism they de
feat the purpose of religion, and
the spirit is relegated to the back
ground. When the flame of devo
tion has found its way to the soul,
struck from the fire from the sword
of a spiritual minister, then the
priest is a blessing. But a bowed
congregation with hearts full of
business and selfishness, makes the
Levite priest a mere mockery. The
Christian fanatic fancies that with
the mere bowing down and repeat
ing of prayers his duties are done.
In this the mistake of Micah is ap
plied by some worshippers to the
whole essence of religion itself. It
is only by living in the spirit that

the community can be blessed by
the presence of the Levite priest, or
the modern minister, or of Christ
Himself.
