# Debaters Choose Sides.
## 
### 
O. C. Spencer, '04, president of
the Intersociety Debating League,
which controls the debates of the
preparatory schools for the student
body challenge cup, has received
word from the Alameda high school
and the Commercial Evening
school of San Francisco, of the
selection of teams and sides. It
is understood at Stanford that the
question will be connected with
the present system of democratic
government in France. The Ala
meda debaters will have the affirm
ative side of the question to
uphold, and the San Francisco
men the negative.
The first speaker for the affirma
tive will be Ralph Marx, who was
a member of Alameda's victor
ious team last year. The other
two speakers for Alameda are
Stephen Otis and Frank O'Brien.
The opening speech for the nega
tive will be made by Lewis T.
Diebels, and the other speakers for

the Commercial Evening school are
Adolph Becker and Walter E.
Trefts. The rebuttal speech for
the Alameda high school will be
made by Frank O'Brien.
All these preliminary arrange
ments are by the students of the
two schools themselves. The
judges for the debate, who will be
members of the Stanford faculty,
have not been definitely chosen.
The debate will be held in the
chapel, as in previous years, and
not in Assembly Hall. It will
occur next Saturday evening,
February 20th.
