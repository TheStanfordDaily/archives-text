Sometime ago Trainer Moulton
received an offer from the manager
of the track team of the University
of Minnesota requesting him to
train the track team for the West
ern meet to be held at Chicago
J.une sth. Since that time William
ette College of Oregon has made
him a similar offer to come to Ore
gon for the meet on June 10th.
Moulton has not yet decided to ac
cept either, and will not know defi
nitely what to do until the Ath
letic Committee meets, when he will
ask to be given a leave of absence
of one month after the intercollegi
ate field-meet. Unless he receives
the full consent of the Athletic
Committee to train another team
after the meet with California he
will not leave Stanford. Moulton
is under contract with Stanford
until May. 1, 1905, and he will
not leave the campus in any event
until her athletic season is over
From May until September there
is practically no work which
requires the presence of a trainer,
so that should he go to either of
the other colleges it would not in
terfere with any athletic work at
Stanford. Moulton was at Minne
sota for five successive years, and
should he leave here for several
months during vacation, he will
probably go to Minnesota for a
month.
