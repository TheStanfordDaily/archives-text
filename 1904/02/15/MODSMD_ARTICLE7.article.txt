Varsity won the first game by the
score of 11 to 10.

fielded better than it has in the
two previous matches, but failed to
hit the ball. Chase, Santa Clara's
second-baseman, was in the box
for the home team, and had the
Stanford men puzzled throughout
the game. He is a left-handed

Stanford meh have not encountered
another left-handed man this sea
son. Stanford made two of her
four runs in the fourth inning, on
three hits and an error, and the
other two in the seventh, on a base
on balls and three errorß. Santa

and four errors, the other runs
being made in the fifth and sixth.

knocked a home run in the second
inning, when there were no men on
bases.
