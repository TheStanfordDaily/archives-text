# Will Meet on Rainy Days.
## 
### 
The recent rains have been such
a Bet-back to the baseball men
that the coach and captain have
decided to put into effect a
new rule. Whenever the diamond

is too muddy to permit practice,
the players will meet at Encina
and will hold an informal discus
sion of the fine points of the game.
The coach expects in this way to
utilize, to a certain extent, time
that would otherwise be wholly
lost. The players, especially those
of little experience, can not fail to
learn a great deal in regard to
the theory of the game that would
take weeks of experience to be
drilled into them on the diamond.
