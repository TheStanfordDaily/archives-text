In a recent issue of the American
Journal of Psychology Professor
Patrick gives a study of the psy
chology of football from a specta
tor's standpoint. He says:
"Jn this game, more than in any
other, except those of the Roman
amphitheatre and their modern
representatives, there is reversion
to aboriginal manners, and hence
a more complete relapse into latent
habits, more perfect rest of the
higher brain centers, more thor
oughgoing rest and recreation. The
game is more brutal, that is, more
primitive, than others. The scene
before us is the old familiar scene
of ages past. The lively chase for
the goals, as for cover, the rude
physical shock of the heavy colli
sions awaken our deep-seated slum
bering instincts, permit us to revel
for a time in these long-restricted
impulses, relieve completely the
strain of the will, and so serve all
the conditions of recreation."
