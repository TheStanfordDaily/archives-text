Tiie report of the treasurer of
the Training-house Corporation,
published in another column, is
very encouraging to those who have
the cause of Stanford athletics at
heart. While the sum of money
available for the construction of
athletic fields is by no means ex
cessively large, it is, nevertheless,
sufficient to justify the corporation
in beginning work on the fields as
soon as the members see fit. The
amount of money that will be
available in 1905 will be about
$8000, and there is more than a
possibility that this may be very
considerably increased, if not
doubled, by contributions. To con
struct athletic fields that will sat
isfy the present needs of the Uni
versity there will be needed about
$18,000 to $20,000. Should it be
necessary the corporation could
borrow any sum of money, within
reason, necessary to complete the
work. The sources of income of
the Training-house Corporation are
stable and afford good security for
a loan. But it is to be hoped that
it will not be necessary for the
University to enter into possession
of athletic grounds which carry
a heavy weight of mortgages and
debt. Whatever may happen in
regard to that, this is clear, that
the corporation is justified in be
ginning work at once with the
funds in its possession. The field
which will be first leveled must, of
course, be decided upon by the
corporation itself. The pew foot
ball field must have been com
pleted by the time the intercolle
giate Varsity game is played in
1905. But the most crying need at
the present time would seem to be
for new baseball fields. There is
but one diamond that can
be used, and the absolute ne
cessity that exists for others can
be thoroughly, appreciated when
the difficulties that arise every
season during the interclass cham
pionship series are remembered.

There seems to be no reason that
work should not be started in the
near future, and every undergrad
uate, when he thinks of the abso
lute lack of facilities that exists at
the present time, will be more than
glad when he sees work begun on
new fields for track, football, and
baseball.
