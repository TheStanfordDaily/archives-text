The track men are now in that
part of the season when ahead there
is an outlook of two months of
hard, unceasing practice and when
there is no stimulus to their en
deavors such as is offered by the
crowds who watch the practice of
the football men from the day the
season opens until the intercollegi
ate game. Their training rules are
carefully outlined, they are urged
to practice daily and to sacrifice
many of the pleasures that go hand
in hand with the daily life of the
college man. But the training
rules that have been announced
are not harder than men in train
ing must always observe. The
greatest danger that a track man
can fall into at this time of the
year is to begin to pity himself for
the hardships he must undergo and
envy those of his fellows who are
undertaking no athletic work and
who live as irregularly as suits
their individual fancies. The track
man should not pity himself, nor
should any one else pity him. He
is working for the credit of his col
lege and is helping himself as well.
The work of the track man arouses
but little comment from day to day,
and to him it appears to be little
appreciated. But the satisfaction
felt by the man who has faithfully
trained throughout the season, and
has won a point for Stanford in
the intercollegiate field meet, will
repay him for every sacrifice.
Stanford is appreciative of these
men, and he who has done his best,
whether he is a point winner or
whether he is used to set the pace,
will receive credit at the hands of
his fellow students.
