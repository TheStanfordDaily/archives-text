# Impressed with American System.

Alfred Mosely, C. M. G., head of |
the Mosely Commission of England,
a band of thirty educational ex
perts, which recently made a trip
through this country investigating
and studying the methods of
schools, colleges and universities,
has an article in the February
number of The World's Work giving
his views of American schools. The
investigation seems to have im
pressed him favorably, for he has
decided to send his two sons to
this country to be educated.
The most striking facts Mr.
Mosely gathered, he says, are these:
1. That the people of the United
States spend a marvelous amount
of money on their public schools,
endowing education more lavishly
than any other people in the world.
2. They do not spend enough.
The salaries to teachers are not
sufficient for the service the country
desires and should have.
He found many things in the
American schools which drew his
frank admiration. In closing the
article he says:
" Whether it is advisable or pos
sible to adopt in Great Britain
any part of this or other features
of American education, the dele
gates will declare with some
authority next spring. As a lay
man with no claim to expert educa
tional knowledge, I should say
that the American excellences are
well worthy of being grafted on the
present English systems. After all,
we must judge by results. The
public education of the United
States has had a large part in
placing the country in the first
rank in the world, industrially and
commercially, at the same time
maintaining a high ideal of civili
zation. There is some disposition
on the part of English observers to
attack American materialism.
What materialism I have seen is
largely ambition. The humanities,
culture, refinement, are not neglect
ed in the schools and colleges. Re
search and scientific inquiry of the
more advanced kind are perhaps
not so highly developed here as
abroad, but there is no serious de
ficiency, and swift progress is being
made. England might well learn
lessons from the way the United
States has worked out its problem."
