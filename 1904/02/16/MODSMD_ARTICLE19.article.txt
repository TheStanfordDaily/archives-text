# TRAINING RULES OUTLINED.
## Requirements for Track Candidates Who Are Placed on Rubbing List. 
### 
The try-outs that were to have
decided whether or not the candi
dates for the track team would be
given a place on the rubbing table
have not been finished. The
trainer and captain had arranged
for a field meet last Saturday
morning, in which all men who are
doing work on the track were ex
pected to contest, in order that the
best might be put on the rubbing
list. Rain prevented the meet Sat
urday, and it has been decided not
to set any special date for the run
ning of trial races, but to have
each man run in his chosen event
at any time within the next week.
Those who are to have their
names on the rubbing list must
equal the following records in their
individual events:
Minutes Seconds
100 yards 11 1-5
220 " 25
440 " 59
880 " 2 19
Mile 5 18
2 miles (six laps) 8 30
Feet Inches
Pole-vault 9 6
Broad jump 19 6
High jump 5 3
Hammer 110
Shot-put 35
Hurdles (to be posted later)
The above records have been
posted for the convenience of the
candidates. Later in the season a
man will be required to do better
work in order to remain on the
table. A large number of men
have already made the table, since
the records made in the handicap
meet held several weeks ago will be
counted to the credit of the men.
If any one has run his particular
event this spring and has equaled
or bettered the required record, a
place is assured.
After February 15th all those
who appear on the track for prac
tice will be expected to observe the
following rules:
1. No smoking, drinking, late
hours. Each man will be allowed
two regular dances before the inter
collegiate meet, the last of which
can be no later than the date of
the Junior Prom. Men are not ex
pected to dance in the evenings.
2. Regularity in practice, and
compliance with the advice of the
trainer and captain, must be
strictly adhered to. Men may
train on any day on the oval ex
cept on the homestretch on wet
days.
Rubbers have been employed for
every day, so that men can train
consistently. Saturday mornings
will be set aside for trials.
