# Praises Boys of Public Schools.

President Eliot of Harvard in his
annual report states that the boy
who enters Harvard from the pub
lic school is the superior of the boy
from the private school:
"Both in entrance examinations
and in honors won in college the
public school boy outstrips the boy
who has had a private tutor, or has
gone to a select school," declares
President Eliot. "The public
school boys are not only more vig
orous and determined to gain
knowledge, but they are also much
more conscientious, a point which
has often been denied."
