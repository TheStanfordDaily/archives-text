Associated Students, per individual promises of members of

"As the members of the corpora
tion are well aware, it has been
decided to carry out the provisions
of the Intercollegiate Agreement
which call for the holding of the
football game at Berkeley in 1904
and at Stanford in 1905. At the
latter date it is probable that the
corporation from its present sources
of income will have between $8000
and $9000. In addition to this it
is probable that certain subscrip
tions promised to the finance com
mittee of the Class of '99 can be
collected. In fact it is not unrea
sonable to suppose that in many
cases the alumni are now ready to
increase the amounts which they
pledged in the spring of '99.
Whether in addition we may ex
pect any assistance from the Board
of Trustees I am unable to say.
Four years ago Mrs. Stanford, sup
posing that the funds of the corpo
ration amounted to $6000 or $7000,
offered to duplicate the amount for
the purpose of building athletic
fields. Whether she would now
feel like repeating this offer in
view of the heavy draughts to be
made on her private purse by the
erection of the Library is doubtful.
"The often expressed purpose of
the corporation to plan grounds,
not merely for the Varsity contests
but for the general use of the stu
dent body, meets with the hearty
approval of the Faculty Committee
on Athletics. I may venture to
say that the committee stand ready
to recommend the plans of the cor
poration to the favorable notice of

the President, and through him to
the Board of Trustees.
"Whatever plans the corporation
may make for increasing its re
sources in the future, it would seem
as if the time were now ripe for
making definite plans for the ath
letic fields and perhaps for begin
ning work on one of them. To
this end I would suggest that the
corporation appoint a committee to
confer with the athletic authorities
and engineers at the University as
to the most favorable disposition of
the fields. A survey of the tract

assigned to the fields was made at
the time of the incorporation of the
Training-house, and this map has
materially increased in value
through work of T. J. Hoover, '00,
who has added contours and posi
tions of trees.
"In making plans for athletic
fields it should he clearly borne in
mind that we are planning not
merely for the needs of the present
time, hut for a future when it is
probable that the University will
have greatly expanded.
"I am, gentlemen, very respect
fully yours, F. Angell,Treasurer."
