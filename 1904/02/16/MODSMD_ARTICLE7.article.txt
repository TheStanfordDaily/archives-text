So much comment has been
caused by the expulsion of five
students from Princeton for cheat
ing in examinations, that a brief
note in regard to it is printed:
"Two residents of the town, not
students, stole the papers and en
deavored to sell t*hem to freshmen
who were to take the examinations.
Five members of the freshman
class bought the papers and used
them in the examinations. An
other student, to whom the papers
were offered, reported the matter to
the student honor committee, who
investigated it and reported to the
faculty the students who had
bought the papers, and also caused
the arrest of the two men who stole
the papers. The honor committee
recommended to the faculty the
expulsion of the students who
bought the papers, and the faculty
acted on the recommendation."
