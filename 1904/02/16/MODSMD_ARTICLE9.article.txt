### 
Seventy-seven inaugural disser
tations for the degree of Ph. D.
have been received from the Uni
versity of Basel, in Switzerland.
Nearly half of the theses treat upon
chemistry, and a large part of the
rest deal with medicine. The re

been classified and placed upon the
shelves in the reference-room.
