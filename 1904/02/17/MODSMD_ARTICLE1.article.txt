# PRESENTS "BEN HUB."
## Montaville Flowers Gives Interesting Recital in Chapel before Appreciative Audience. 
### 
The recital from "Ben Hur"
given by Montaville Flowers in the
University chapel last night was
one of exceptional merit. Mr.
Flowers presented the main points
and chief characters of the story
within the period of an hour.and
three quarters. This requires
knack and dramatic skill.
He divided the story into four
acts, Ben Hur being the central
figure in each. The scenes as
given by Mr. Flowers move with
clearness and smoothness. The
last act, in point of organization,
is most difficult to manage, and it
might be criticised for its lack of
unity, but it is hard to see how it
could be improved.
Mr. Flowers' impersonations are
excellent. The character of Ben
Hur—at first youthful, but later
strengthened and sinewed by hard
service in the galleys, and by his
experience with men —was well
drawn. Simonides, the aged ser
vant of the family of Hur, was also
strongly given, though at times a
trifle overdrawn. Mr. Flowers'
style in description is unique, yet
forceful and effective. His deliv
ery of descriptive passages is sel
dom conversational but is marked
by a sustained tone which in har
mony and rhythmic force fre
quently gives lyric beauty to the
lines.
The chariot race was done with
rare power. In this scene the
temptation to act the description is
great, but Mr. Flowers' rendition
was sust lined, tactful, intense.
Ease and naturalness of tran
sition, especially from highly
wrought passion to subdued feel
ing, are charming features of Mr.
Flowers' work and add not a little
to the effectiveness of his reading.
