# Training-House Corporation Meets.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the trustees of
the Training-house Corporation,
held in San Francisco last week,
little business of a definite nature
was transacted, except the reading
of the annual report of the treas
urer. One hundred and fifty dol
lars was allowed the student body
treasurer for the erection of the
rubbing-shed on the track. The
election of new members was post
poned until the next meeting, to be
held in two weeks. This action
was due to irregularities in the
nominations, to which the Execu
tive Committee will attend at its
meeting tonight.
There was considerable discussion
of the plans and prospects for the
new athletic field, but no definite
action was taken.
