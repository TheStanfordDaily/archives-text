There appears to be little reason
for the present apathy that exists
among the track athletes of the
different classes in regard to the
approaching field meet to be held
on Junior Day. At this period of
last year the track men were elect
ing their track captains, and plans
were being made to develop teams
for the interclass meet. While the
general training that the track men
are doing for the Varsity team
would seem to do away with the
necessity for class organization at
this early date, there is, neverthe
less, a decided benefit to be derived
from arousing a sense of class ri
valry and so increasing the efforts
of the men in training. Especially
is this true in regard to the Freeh
man class. Among the men who
have already done a year's work
on the track there exists a certain
feeling of responsibility that will
keep them at their tasks; but the
men who are out for the first time,
as a rule, fail to pull together.
Several meets between the Fresh
man track team and the prepara
tory schools of the vicinity will
be held during the season, and if
the Stanford men are to acquit
themselves creditably there should
be some one chosen to arrange for
the details that a busy coach can
not always supervise. The pres
ence on the track of four captains
who are trying to build up four re
spective teams will lie an added
incentive to the efforts of the men,
and will put a spirit into their
work that is lacking in the ordi
nary daily training. It is to be
hoped that the men will take some
action in regard to this at once,
both for the good of the coming
field meet and for the indirect aid
to the Varsity track team.
