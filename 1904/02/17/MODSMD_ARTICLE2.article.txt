# Progress of Outer Quadrangle.
## 
### 
The stone-work [on the arcade
forming the southern side of the
outer quadrangle has progressed so
far that connection has been made
with the Engineering building at
the southeast corner. A number of
men have been employed on the
work almost every day for the past
few weeks, and their labors should
be completed within a few days
more.
When this is done, carpenters
and tilers will be put at work,
and the paving will then be attend
ed to. All this may take consid
erable time. This will mark the
completion of the stone-work of the
outer quadrangle,which was begun
with the laying of the cornerstone
for the Thomas Welton Stanford
Library Building in 18S8. The
University Library, Assembly Hall,
and Memorial Arch were completed
in 1899, and the Treaurer's office
and other buildings during the
past year. The southern part of
the outer quadrangle differs from
the northern line in that its only
buildings are at the two corners.
The rest is formed by the arcade,
which connects the two buildings.
The outer side of the arcade has a
slight curve, following the lines of
Memorial Church.
