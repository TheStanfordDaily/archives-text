# TRACK MEET WITH POMONA.
## Group of Strong Athletes to Contest With Varsity Early in April. 
### 
Arrangements have now been
completed to bring tbe track team
of Pomona College from Los An
geles to the campus for a field-day
with the Varsity track men on
either the sth or 6th of April.
Pomona won the Soutnern Califor
nia football championship during
the past Reason, and defeated the
Sherman Indians by a larger score
than did Stanford. Her track team
has the reputation of being on a
par with her football eleven, and
the contest will necessarily be of
interest.
The Southern team claims to
have a man enered in the quarter
mile who will defeat Dunn in the
coming meet.
Pomona is also scheduled to meet
the track team of the University
of California on March 30th. The
trip of the Southern team to the
North is a further indication of the
advance in athletics which Pomo
na has been making during the
past few years.
