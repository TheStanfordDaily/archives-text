# TRAINING-HOUSE DIRECTORS.
## New Nominations by the Executive Committee.— McDowell Tells of Plans. 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents last night renominations
were made to till vacancies on the
board of directors of the Training
house Corporation caused by the
resignation of It. S. Fisher, ex-'O2,
and Mil nor Roberts, '99. The fol
lowing men were nominated: For
the vacancy caused by the resigna
tion of Fisher —R. B. Ball, '04, W.
It. Hamilton, '04, and F. L. Berry,
'99; for the vacancy caused by the
resignation of Roberts —Assistant
Professor C. R. Lewers, '96, of the
Law department, Dr. T. A. Storey,
'96, director of Encina gymnasium,
and C. M. Fickert, '98. The direc
tors of the Training-house Corpor
ation elect one director from each
group of names.
The reason that no election was
made at the last meeting of the
Training-house Corporation from
the first list of names selected by
the Executive Committee at that
time, was that, owing to a misun
derstanding, there had been a fail
ure to group them. As soon as it
can be arranged there will be an
other meeting of the board, when
the vacancies will be filled.
J. E. McDowell, '00, a member
of the board of directors of the
Training-house Corporation, ap
peared before the Executive Com
mittee last night and took occasion
to explain to that body the kind of
men who should be given places
upon the board. McDowell said
that at the present time some of
the members of the board are liv
ing away from the University, and
as a consequence it is impossible to
hold meetings as often as is desir
able. The work that is entrusted
to the corporation is now nearing
the point where active operations
will be begun, and it is important,
he said, that undergraduates should
be given representation on the
board, or, at the least, men who
are located in places readily acces
sible to the University, so that
there may be no delay in the car
rying on of the directors' work. It
is important, too, McDowell said,
that the undergraduates selected
should be men of prominence in
athletics, since the work to be done
vitally concerns them.
A representative from the Law
department, he said, would he val
uable because of the legal problems
that constantly come before the
board, requiring reference to a
lawyer. It is equally important
that the Engineering department
be represented because of the work
of that kind that must be done.
Such members upon the board
would tend to diminish greatly the
expense that must be incurred by
the board. McDowell said that
since work upon the athletic field
would undoubtedly be begun within
a reasonable time, it was of the
greatest importance that the
Training-house Corporation be re
organized as quickly as possible
with a membership that might be
regarded as fairly permanent.
Acting upon these suggestions,
the Executive Committee pro

ceeded to make its nominations.
Ball, Hamilton, and Fickert are
representatives of the different
branches of sport; Hamilton is
familiar with surveying, and Lew
ers is a capable representative of
the Law department. Berry is also
a lawyer. Dr. Storey represents the
gymnasium, and is, besides, inter
ested in other branches of sport.
