Within a short time the direc
tors of the Training-house Corpora
tion will have filled their ranks hv
the choice of two men from among
the six nominated at the meeting
of the Executive Committee last
night. It is a happy fact that
they can not he very far wrong in
their choice. Some of us may
vary in our ideas as to the compar
ative worth of the six nominees,
but certainly the present Executive
Committee has been less partisan
and more wise than others of re
cent years. The time seems to be
approaching when men at Stanford
will be selected or rejected as they
are fit or unfit for an office. And
it is well that this is so in regard
to the Training-house Corporation,
for that body, which through long
periods has done nothing, is about
to become one of the most impor
tant figures in the directing of
Stanford's future in athletics.
These gentlemen have thrust upon
them a grave responsibility. They
must spend an inadequate sum of
money judiciously and wisely in
an attempt to give to Stanford
undergraduates adequate athletic
fields. They must look not only
to the present but to the future,
and they must be careful lest
their funds become exhausted be
fore the work nears completion.
The significance of the corpora
tion becomes more apparent than
when the work of building was an
indefinite plan not to be attempted
for many years. This being the
case, the election of men to the
Corporation is a serious matter.
The directors have a good field
from which to pick, and it is to be
hoped that they will choose the
men best fitted, both as regards
interest in the undertaking, ability
to help, and willingness to sacrifice
valuable time and effort to the
good of the University.
