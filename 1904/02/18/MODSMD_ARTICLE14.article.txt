# Woodwork in Outer Quad.
## 
### 
A contract has recently been let
for the carpenter work on the un
completed portion of the outer
quadrangle. Work will begin at
once. The arcades around the
Geology building will be finished
first, and then, after the stone
masons are through with the Bouth
portion of the arcades, that part
will also be completed. The ceiling
will be of Oregon pine, finished as in
the rest of the arcades. The inter
ior of the Geology building is ready
for the plasterers, and after they
are through the interior woodwork
of the building will be finished. It
is expected that everything will
have been completed within nine
months.
