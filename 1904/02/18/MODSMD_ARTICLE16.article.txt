# The 						Kilties Band.

### 
The Kilties Band, which will
render a concert at Stanford on the
evening of March 4th, is at present
on its eighth semi-annual tour of
the United States. The organiza
tion scores a success wherever it
performs,and, owing to the unusual
character of its concert, appeals to
people of widely different tastes.
The band is not only a collection
of famous instrumental musicians,
but numbers in its ranks many ac
complished vocalists, and several
men who do sword dancing and
highland dancing characteristic of
Scotland.
Robinson is band-master, and he
brings with him a wide reputation
as a director. To the care and
good judgment displayed by Robin
son in his selection of music and to
the novel features of the band is
due, in a great measure, the success
which has uniformly marked the
efforts of the players.
From an artistic point of view
the band presents an interesting
sight. The kilted uniforms of dark
red and green tartan, with bright
red coa'ts and beautifully arranged
plaids, are typical of the Scots.
The array of colors presented by
the uniforms has been planned
with a skill that has resulted in a
most artistic effect.
