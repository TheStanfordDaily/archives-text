# Dr. Abbott Lectures.

### 
Dr. Abbott, professor of Law, last
night delivered the fourth in his
series of lectures, before an inter
ested audience of Law students.
His address touched upon the life
and career of John Austin and his
wife Sarah Austin. In introduc
tion the speaker showed that the
school of jurisprudence was divided
into metaphysical, historical, and
analytical branches, and that to
the latter belonged Austin. Dr.
Abbott traced the line of descend
ance of Austin, and spoke of his
early life.
Austin at an earl}' age was placed
in the army, but was suddenly
called home upon the death of his
younger brother. After this he
spent his time in the study of law,
and was called to the bar at the
age of twenty-eight. As a practic
ing lawer lie was not a success. He
retired to private life, but later
took the chair of jurisprudence at
University College, London. His
efforts there seemed unsuccessful,
and he resigned his position in
1832, after teaching four years.
After making a failure at the bar
and as an instructor, Austin bent
his energies to the publication of a
valuable law treatise, "The Prov
ince of Jurisprudence Determined,"
which was published a few months
after his retirement from Univer
sity College. The publication did
not meet with public approval, and
only a few volumes were printed.
Later the public came to appreci
ate the great work, and an endeavor
was made to get Austin to repub
lish his work, but this attempt was
a failure. Austin failed in a sec
ond attempt to lecture in 1834, and
died in 1859 a poor man.
Dr. Abbott then showed the part
Austin's wife played in the ulti
mate republication of her hus
band's work. From the old edi
tion, together with a few notes of
little value, Mrs. Austin recon
structed the whole book which
brought fame to her husband and
marked him as one of the greatest
English law chroniclers.
After the close of his lecture Dr.
Abbott introduced Judge Wall, a
member of the Illinois Board of
Law Commissioners, who spoke
briefly on the "System of Law Ex
aminations in Illinois."
