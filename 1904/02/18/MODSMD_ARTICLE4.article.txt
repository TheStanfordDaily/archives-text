Lieutenant Godfrey L. Carden,
superintendent of arsenal tools in
the machinery department of the
World's Fair, will deliver a lecture
in the chapel on the evening of
February 23d.
Lieutenant Carden is one of a
number of officers of the Army,
Navy, and Revenue Cutter Service,
serving under Government orders
at the St. Louis Exposition. For
nearly a year past he has been
engaged in the principal countries
in Europe in securing views for
the machinery department of the
Exposition. In obtaining the lat
est engines, electric generators, and
accessories for the great power
plant of the World's Fair —a plant
involving nearly 53,000 horse
power — Lieutenant Carden exam
ined the outputs of more than 1200
of the leading industrial establish
ments of the world.
Lieutenant Carden's lecture will
be of direct interest to the Engi
neering students. The address,
however, will be of general interest,
and while it will deal particularlj'
with the display of machinery, it
will also treat of the World's Fair
in general. The lecture will be
illustrated with lantern-slides of
the principal buildings, together
with photographs of many of the
striking scenes on the grounds.
No admission will be charged to
the lecture.
