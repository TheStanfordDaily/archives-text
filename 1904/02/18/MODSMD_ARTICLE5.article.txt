# ACTIVITY IN BOATING.
## Plans for Interclass Regatta.â€”Little Probability of Intercollegiate Rowing This Year. 
### 
The plans of the Boat Club
for the interclass regattas are near
ing completion, and practice will
begin within a few days. In the
meantime the boathouse will be
moved to the southeast corner of
the lake and fitted to accommodate
the old and new boats, together
with other boating paraphernalia.
Lagunita is now sulficiently filled
with water to receive the boats, and
an effort is being made to stop up
the leak, which in former years has
caused the lake to become dry about
June. If this is accomplished it
will enable the club to carry on
fall practice. The new boats which
were ordered are expected to be a
little late in arriving, and until
they come the men will use the
two old ones now on hand. It is
expected that about fifty candidates
will come out for work.
Representatives of the Univer
sity of California Boating Associa
tion have endeavored to arrange
an intercollegiate Freshman race
to take place this spring. The
executive committee of the Stan
ford Boat Club took the matter
under advisement, but decided that
such a contest would be impossible
at the present time, owing to the
unorganized state of rowing in the
University.
