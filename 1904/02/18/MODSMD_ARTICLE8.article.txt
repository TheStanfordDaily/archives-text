# Meeting of Athletic Committee.
## 
### 
The Athletic Committee at its
meeting last night formally ratified
the changes in the Intercollegiate
Agreement between California and
Stanford as adopted at the recent
meeting of the Intercollegiate Ath
letic Committee.
Among several letters read was
one from the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation, inquiring as to Stanford's
intentions regarding a continuance
of her membership in the associa
tion. Action in the matter was
deferred until the next meeting.
In regard to the question of rec
ords, letters- have been received
from Harvard, Wisconsin, and
Minnesota stating that they will
not recognize the record recentl}'
made by W. F. Dunn, '04, in the
quarter-mile, as it was not made in
an intercollegiate contest. Action
on this was also deferred.
