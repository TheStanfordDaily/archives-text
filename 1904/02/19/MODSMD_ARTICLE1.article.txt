# VARSITY VS. INDEPENDENTS.
## Stanford Will Meet San Francisco Nine in First Game of Series at 3 Tomorrow. 
### 
At 3 tomorrow afternoon the
Varsity baseball team will play
the first game of the series with the
Independents. Ireland, who man
aged this team last year, lias or
ganized a nine that is fully the
equal of the one that met Stanford
hist season. Among the men are
three who have played in the big
eastern leagues. Streib, who will
be in left held, captained the Kan
sas City team of the American
League' last year; Shay, who will
be at short-stop, has been signed
by the St. Louis National League
to cover that position next season;
and Schmidt, who will he in center
field, played in the Brooklyn Na
tional League last season. The
complete line-up of the Independ
ents will probably be about the
same as that for the scheduled
game of two weeks ago. The prob
able line-up follows: Pitcher, Ser
ine; catcher. Morrison; first base,
Goslinsky; second base, Deheny;
short-stop, Shay; third base, Spen
cer; left field, Streib; center field,
Schmidt; right field, Ireland.
The Stanford line-up will be as
follows: Pitcher, Tritch; catcher,
Ball; first base, Matthews; second
base, Williams; short-stop, Trow
bridge; third base, Swain; left field,
Chalmers; center field, Wirt; right
field, Sales.
One of Captain Ball's fingers
was injured in yesterday's game
with Santa Clara College, and is
still very sore. If it has not im
proved by tomorrow Hall will re
sign the catcher's position to Stott,
and will take one of the positions
in the outfield.
