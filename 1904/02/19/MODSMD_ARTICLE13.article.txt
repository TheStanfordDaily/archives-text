During every athletic season
there is a protest from the editorial
columns of the different college
publications to support the team,
to be enthusiastic, to refrain from
useless criticism, â€”in a word, to do
everything that is desirable and
leave undone the useless things.
This regularly recurring voice of
protest is frequently disregarded as
being stale, and the editor is criti
cised because he follows in the
paths worn smooth by the footsteps
of his predecessors. Nevertheless
the mistakes of today must be cor
rected as much as were those of
yesterday, and the student body is
making a mistake today in the way
it is failing to support the baseball
nine. When a baseball team, after
fighting for eleven innings to win a
victory for Stanford, can leave the
field without a cheer, it is time for
protest, and for good, vigorous pro

test. Tomorrow the Varsity will
play again, and there will be a
chance for us all to get behind the
team and show that its work is ap
preciated. Whether we win or
whether we lose, it will be little to
the credit of the student body if
the team is nut cheered at the close
of the game.
