Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Ah "a man of the bleachers," I
would like to call attention through
your columns to the serious need at
the present moment of a second
yell leader. One of the two elected
yell, leaders has left college, and
the other being unable to attend
most of the baseball games, the
men on the bleachers who would
like to help the players along with
an occasional cheer for a good
piece of work can not do more than
a little hand clapping. There will
be no cheering as long as there is
no organization, and there will be
no organization until a leader is
found. Within a few weeks we are
going -to have our intercollegiate
games, and if the present condition
lasts much longer our cheering will
be weak and disorganized. Why
does not some prominent upper
classman step forth and fill the
breach. Let several of them try it.
Two new leaders must be developed
for next year, and the sooner they
appear the better.
A Stanford Man.
