# "Chaparral" Out Monday.
## 
### 
The leap-year number of the
Chaparral will lie on sale Monday,
and will contain as a special prose
feature the opinions of one hun
dred prominent women students in
regard to the kind of men they
would like to marry. A full-page
drawing hy Oppenheim, '05, en
titled "A Few Valentines that Wil
lie Got," a head by Borough, '04,
together with sketches by B. C.
Bubb, '04, Miss C. M. Lathrop, '06,
and R. E. Snodgrass, instructor in
Entomology, make up the art fea
tures. The leading verse feature
is a parody on "The Old Oaken
Bucket," satirizing the new custom
of blowing a steam whistle at
12:15 o'clock. Editorially the ab
sence of class dances, and the or
ganization of a Phi Beta Kappa
chapter at Stanford, receive com
ment.
The Faculty Chaparral was sent
to the printers this afternoon, and
will be on sale a week from Mon
day. The Chaparral will give
with the issue a portrait of Dr. Jor
dan. This picture, taken especially
for the Chaparral, shows Dr. Jor
dan in his doctor's gown, and is es
pecially good. The issue will be a
double one and twice the usual
number of copies will be printed.
