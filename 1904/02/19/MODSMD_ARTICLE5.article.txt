Santa Clara scored three runs in

hits, an error, and a base on balls,
and two more runs in the fourth

on balls, stole second, and tried to
score on Wirt's drive to left field,
but was put out at the plate.
Both teams phiyed better ball
than in their former games. Sales
played the best game for Stanford,
pitching in fine form and hitting
well. He pitched eleven innings,
struck out eight men and did not
give a base on balls. He obtained
three hits out of four times at the
bat. Wirt hit the ball hard also,
and was credited with three singles.
The team played faster ball than
usual, but were weak in base-run
ning, and lost several chances to
score on this account.
Wallman, of Santa Clara, pitched
a steady game, and was given good
support.
