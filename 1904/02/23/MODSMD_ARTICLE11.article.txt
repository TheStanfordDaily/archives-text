# TO GIVE OPERA "PATIENCE."
## Senior Farce Committee Decides to Depart from Undergraduate Production. 
### 
The Senior Farce Committee has
decided not to give the usual farce
during commencement week, hut
to stage instead Gilbert and Sul
livan's opera "Patience." This
action was taken by the committee
as a result of the poor success of the
farces of the past few years. It is
believed that the famous opera can
be put iÂ»n with success here. There
are a number of fine voices among
the men and women of the Uni
versity, and many persons have
expressed their willingness to take
part in the production. The Uni
versity Orchestra is playing in very
good form, its work being almost
equal to that of a professional ag
gregation. Under these circum
stances, it is believed the perform
ance should be a very creditable
one.
The entire management of the
affair will be left in the hands of a
professional stage manager from
San Francisco, for whose services
negotiations are now under way.
The selection of cast and chorus
will be completely in his hands.
One of the principal actors will
probably be C. H. liaker, '04, and
other members of the Glee Club
and Girls' Glee Club will be se
lected. The preliminary arrange
ments will all be completed by the
end of this week, and rehearsals
will be begun early next week and
carried on faithfully. Costumes
and scenery will be procured in
San Francisco. The production
will be as elaborate as the finances
of the class will permit. The
opera will he given on the evening
of Thursday, May 12th.
The fnrce committee is composed
of the following members: Miss R.
L. Kimball, Miss E. M. Hale. Miss
I. A.. Wright, A. Perrin, W. H.
Thomson, and F. H. Fowler,
chairman.
