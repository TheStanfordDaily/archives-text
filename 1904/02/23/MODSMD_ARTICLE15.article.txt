The action of the Senior Farce
Committee will be mire to attract
a great deal of comment from the
members of the class. There has
been such a general and loudly
voiced cry for a change in the
character of Stanford theatricals,
and a feeling of such great pleasure
that the Sophomore play was an
artistic success, that the members
of the Farce Committee would
seem to need to look no farther
than this for their justification.
Whatever the wisdom of their step
may be, they certainly need to
justify their position to the class.
Certainly Stanford has had some
disgraceful plays foisted upon her
during the last few years, and espec
ially shameful has it been when the
commencement week visitors have
been forced to witness such per
formances as the best that Stan
ford talent could produce. But the
senior farce was a firmly estab
lished feature of Senior Week, it
was as regularly included in the
plans for the graduating fes-tivilies
as was the laying of the class
plate. This unprecedented change
in the old customs should not be
unaccompanied by an explanation
to the class of the exact reasons
that called for the action on the
part of the committee. The class
may ratify the action, but it will
wish to know exactly why it was
taken without giving our own
authors a elm nee to show whether
their work was good or bad.
