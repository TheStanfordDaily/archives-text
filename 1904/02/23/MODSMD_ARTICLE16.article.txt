# "Chaparral" Is Out.
## 
### 
The edition of the Chaparral
which appeared today contains
more than the ordinary amount of
verse. "A Reverie of Nooning"
and "Farm Hands" ure particu
larly good. The drawings on the
whole are very good, among the
best being two or three which aim
to illustrate the joys of a student
on Valentine's Day, and also one
entitled "In a New Light," which
points a moral.
