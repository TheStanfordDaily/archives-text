# DEFEAT INDEPENDENTS.
## Ireland's Team Beaten by the Decisive Score of Six to One. 
### 
The Varsity defeated the Inde
pendents Saturday afternoon in a
fast game by the score of six to one.
Ireland's team of professionals did
not prove dangerous after the
fourth inning, as they were never
able to hit the ball safely. The
Independents' lone score came in
the second inning, when Morrison
knocked a swift drive to left field.
Although this was but a base hit,
Chalmers' error allowed the runner
to get home before the ball could
be fielded in.
Stanford scored two runs in the
fourth on three hits and an error,
one in the sixth, and three in the
seventh on three hits, one of them
for two bases by Wirt.
The sensation of the game came
in the ninth inning. Tritch bad
given two bases on balls and a hit
filled the bases with no one out.
Perine hit a low drive to Trow
bridge at short-stop, who caught it,
touched second and threw it to first
base, catching the players off those
bases and making a triple play.
The Varsity played much better
ball than it has previously and
showed more life and interest in
the game. Wirt batted well, ob
taining two hits, one of them being
for two bases. Matthews was tried
at first base and played an error
less game. Tritch pitched well,
allowing but two bits, and but six
men received bases on balls. Lan
agan was in the box for the Inde
pendents and allowed but eight
hits, but failed to keep them scat
tered.
