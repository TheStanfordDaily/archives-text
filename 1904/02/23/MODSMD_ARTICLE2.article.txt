The ch'pel was crowded .Satur
day night by an interested audi
ence to hear the fourth annual
high school debute for the cup
offered by the student body. The
two contesting teams were those of
the Alameda High School and the
Commercial Evening School of San

companied by a large body of
supporters, who enthusiastically
cheered their representatives. The
question discussed was, "Resolved,
That a democratic government is
adapted to the French people; pro
vided, the present form of govern
ment is conceded to be democratic."
Alameda supported the affirmative
side, and the Commercial Evening
School the negative. The decision
of the judges resulted in a victory
for the negative.
Alameda was represented bv
Ralph Marx, Stephen Otis, and
Frank O'Brien. The Commercial
Evening School was championed
by Lewis T. Diebels, Adolph Becker,
and Walter E. Trefts.
The contest throughout was very
even, and the judges were some
time in coming to a decision. The
Alameda team Bhowed better form
and more experience, but the Com
mercial team had the better side
of the question. This is the best
debate that has yet been given for
the cup contests.
