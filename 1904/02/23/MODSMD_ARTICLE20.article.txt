# MEET A SUCCESS.
## Law Men Won Interdepartment Contest on the Track Last Saturday. 
### 
On a track which was slow, due
to the rain of the day previous, the
representatives of the Law depart
ment won the interdepartment field
meet on the oval last Saturday
morning. The meet was in the
nature of an experiment. The
men were grouped in their various
departments and entered each
event under this classification. An
unusually large number of track
athletes participated.
With a total of twenty men in
the meet, the Law department
easily won first place. Ffteen of the
men entered won points. The
highest average goes to the Chem
istry department, as the five men
entered scored a total of 55A points.
There were four teams of four
men each entered in the half-mile
relay. The Law representatives
easily won the race, with Maloy,
'06, West, '06, Dunn, '04, and
Wood, '07. Aside from the de
partment affiliations, the results
show a total of 63 points for 1904,
17 for 1905, 24 for 1906, and 13 for
1907.
The winners in the events are
given in the order in which they
finished.
