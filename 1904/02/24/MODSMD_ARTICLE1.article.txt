# SPEECHES AT ASSEMBLY.
## Dr. Angell, Associate Professor Peirce, and J.F. Lanagan, '00, Make Addresses. 
### 
The University Assembly this
morning was given over toa discus
sion of athletic affairs. The speak
ers were Dr. F. Angell, who acted
as presiding officer, Associate Pro
fessor Peirce of the Botany depart
ment, and J. F. Lanagan, '00.
Dr. Angell, in speaking of the
present condition of athletics at
Stanford, said that there were alto
gether too few men taking part in
athletics. Only nineteen per cent
of the undergraduates participate
in general athletics, and this num
ber includes the many who are
barred from intercollegiate con
tests by certain provisions of the
intercollegiate agreement. If all
the boating, tennis, basket-ball,
and gymnasium club men were in
cluded, the total would not reach
twenty-five per cent of the men.
This is not the situation at other
universities, Dr. Angell said. At
Harvard seventy per cent of the
men are engaged in athletics, a
large, number for the sake of the
sport itself.
Professsor Peirce told of the pro
visions for athletics at Harvard,
from which college he was grad
uated. The athletic field of Har
vard was the gift of Major Higgin
son, who gave it as a memorial to
the Harvard men who fell in the
Civil War. It is called Soldiers'
Field. It has all possible conven
iences for sport —boat-houses, ten
nis courts, baseball fields, football
grounds, and a track. Two years
ago the class of 1879 gave $100,000
to the Harvard Corporation to
partly pay for massive steel bleach
ers, which are permanent and
absolutely safe. They are built on
a plan suggested by the Roman
Coliseum. The objection to the
great stadium, Professor Peirce
thought, is the fact that it adds
greatly to the expenses of athletics,
already high. The added expense,
he said, was for the benefit of the
few who were fortunate enough to
take part in intercollegiate con
tests. The Soldiers' Field he re
garded as the better of the two,
because it gave an opportunity for
a very large number of men to
enjoy themselves in open - air
sport.
J. F. Lanagan, '00, spoke of the
necessity of a training-house. "No
one realizes," he said, "what the
football men have had to put up
with in the way of training. We
have done the best we can, but the
conditions are very bad. You have
all seen the little sheds built at the
end of the track that serve as
rubbing quarters. These are often
so crowded that the men can
scarcely move around. There is
very little warm water. The suits
are never dried —they are always
dirty and wet. Until we have a
training-house the men on the
training-table can not be together,
which is a very essential thing.
These daily informal gatherings
are very important things in foot
ball. We can not win a game un
less the men can get to know and
like one another, and will help
one another out.

"We have been told that the
new gymnasium will provide many
of these things, but 1 do not think
it will at all do away with the
necessity for a training-house. We
must have a place where the men
can come together, if we want to
win games. It is not necessary
that the place be as elaborate as
has at times been phi lined. Some
provision for the men right on the
field must be made, and especially
for visiting teams.
"The undergraduates must take
the initiative in this matter. They
must bestir themselves and keep
the project moving. It will not ck>
simply to appoint a committee and
call the thing done. If a circular
letter were written to the alumni,
1 feel sure that they would respond.
We have not the large number of
alumni that the Eastern universi
ties have to draw upon, but we
expect to have. Many of them are
rich, and I am certain would con
tribute liberally.
"Everything is being done now
adays to put athletics on a
business-like basis, which seems a
good thing to me. The question is
how to get a winning team the
most quickly; how to develop the
best men. This is exemplified by
the work of the baseball men at
the present time. Their weak
point is batting, and every effort is
being made by Captain Ball and
Coach Doyle to develop that. If the
team continues to improve through
the season as it has been doing it is
going to win or come back with a
very creditable showing."

The University Assembly this
morning was given over toa discus
sion of athletic affairs. The speak
ers were Dr. F. Angell, who acted
as presiding officer, Associate Pro
fessor Peirce of the Botany depart
ment, and J. F. Lanagan, '00.
Dr. Angell, in speaking of the
present condition of athletics at
Stanford, said that there were alto
gether too few men taking part in
athletics. Only nineteen per cent
of the undergraduates participate
in general athletics, and this num
ber includes the many who are
barred from intercollegiate con
tests by certain provisions of the
intercollegiate agreement. If all
the boating, tennis, basket-ball,
and gymnasium club men were in
cluded, the total would not reach
twenty-five per cent of the men.
This is not the situation at other
universities, Dr. Angell said. At
Harvard seventy per cent of the
men are engaged in athletics, a
large, number for the sake of the
sport itself.
Professsor Peirce told of the pro
visions for athletics at Harvard,
from which college he was grad
uated. The athletic field of Har
vard was the gift of Major Higgin
son, who gave it as a memorial to
the Harvard men who fell in the
Civil War. It is called Soldiers'
Field. It has all possible conven
iences for sport —boat-houses, ten
nis courts, baseball fields, football
grounds, and a track. Two years
ago the class of 1879 gave $100,000
to the Harvard Corporation to
partly pay for massive steel bleach
ers, which are permanent and
absolutely safe. They are built on
a plan suggested by the Roman
Coliseum. The objection to the
great stadium, Professor Peirce
thought, is the fact that it adds
greatly to the expenses of athletics,
already high. The added expense,
he said, was for the benefit of the
few who were fortunate enough to
take part in intercollegiate con
tests. The Soldiers' Field he re
garded as the better of the two,
because it gave an opportunity for
a very large number of men to
enjoy themselves in open - air
sport.
J. F. Lanagan, '00, spoke of the
necessity of a training-house. "No
one realizes," he said, "what the
football men have had to put up
with in the way of training. We
have done the best we can, but the
conditions are very bad. You have
all seen the little sheds built at the
end of the track that serve as
rubbing quarters. These are often
so crowded that the men can
scarcely move around. There is
very little warm water. The suits
are never dried —they are always
dirty and wet. Until we have a
training-house the men on the
training-table can not be together,
which is a very essential thing.
These daily informal gatherings
are very important things in foot
ball. We can not win a game un
less the men can get to know and
like one another, and will help
one another out.

"We have been told that the
new gymnasium will provide many
of these things, but 1 do not think
it will at all do away with the
necessity for a training-house. We
must have a place where the men
can come together, if we want to
win games. It is not necessary
that the place be as elaborate as
has at times been phi lined. Some
provision for the men right on the
field must be made, and especially
for visiting teams.
"The undergraduates must take
the initiative in this matter. They
must bestir themselves and keep
the project moving. It will not ck>
simply to appoint a committee and
call the thing done. If a circular
letter were written to the alumni,
1 feel sure that they would respond.
We have not the large number of
alumni that the Eastern universi
ties have to draw upon, but we
expect to have. Many of them are
rich, and I am certain would con
tribute liberally.
"Everything is being done now
adays to put athletics on a
business-like basis, which seems a
good thing to me. The question is
how to get a winning team the
most quickly; how to develop the
best men. This is exemplified by
the work of the baseball men at
the present time. Their weak
point is batting, and every effort is
being made by Captain Ball and
Coach Doyle to develop that. If the
team continues to improve through
the season as it has been doing it is
going to win or come back with a
very creditable showing."
