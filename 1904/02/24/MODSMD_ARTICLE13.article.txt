The University Assembly this
morning has probably opened the
eyes of a number of undergraduates
to the disadvantages under which
Stanford athletes labor when in
training for the different teams.
The football men were heavily
handicapped last season; for sev
eral years the tennis men have had
nothing provided for them; the
baseball men still lack adequate
facilities; and the track men are as
poorly provided for as any. When
it is taken into consideration that
a Stanford track team must be de
veloped individually; that there is
no common meeting-place, no
training-table—where the men can
first of all be provided with proper
food, and second, and of hardly
less importance, be brought into
close and friendly touch with one
another —the wonderful morale that
has existed and still exists among
the track men is to be wondered at.
The intercollegiate field meet of
last year was evidence of the feel
ing which influenced every man on
the team to sacrifice himself for the
general good, and the same spirit
exists among the track men this
year. They are working hard,
careful plans for the general devel
opment of the team have been
materialized by trainer and cap
tain, and in the interdepartment
meet the showing of the men who
were formerly unknown is proof
that remarkable strides toward a
strong and united team are being
made. This is true in spite of the
fact that the track men are by no
means given the support on the
part of the student body that the
football men take as their due.
Last Saturday there was a free
field meet and the bleachers were
far from filled, while during the
football season every afternoon the
stands were crowded with men

there was organized cheering, and
the players on the field knew that
the student body was behind them.
It may not be possible to have a
training-table for the track men,
but there is a chance that it is
possible; it can be done if there is
a spirit of determination, and it is
almost a prerequisite of a victory
in the intercollegiate meet. Let
every undergraduate show an in
terest in the thing. Let him show
that the track men are not working
alone and unappreciated, and then
if the trainer, the captain, the track
men and the student body together
say "we must have a training
table," some way will be devised,
if the question resolves itself for
solution into a popular subscrip
tion.
