Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Apropos of the "editorial about
nothing" in the current issue of the
Chaparral, will you permit me to
say through your columns some
things which it would he good for
Chappie to hear?
First, I must plead guilty to be
ing one of the four hundred and
eighty-two whom Chappie does not
love, and who would love Chappie
a great deal better if he possessed
the literary instinct which would
lead him to eliminate from his
classic pages, along with a few un
mentionable expletives, the objec
tionable terms * co-ed" and "peli
can." These noxious California
exotics should not be allowed to
cumber the soil of the Stanford
farm.
Second, in company with a ma
jority of my sex —and, 1 strongly
suspect,with a majority of the more
fortunate one thousand who can
neglect matters like the support of
college publications without sub
jecting themselves to the cutting
sarcasm of Chappie's "Now Thats"
—1 prefer to pay fifteen cents a
copy for the paper on the quad. I
find by careful computation that
this increases Chappie's yearly in
come ten cents beyond the regular
subscription price, and at the same
time I have the advantage of get
ting the material while it is hot.
Some of us Stanford women find,
too, that our supply of ready
money is not commensurate with
our large-hearted interest in stu
dent body affairs. Where the ne
cessity of discriminating is forced
upon us, Chappie will surely con
cede to us the right of exercising
our own judgment; and he should
not take it as a personal matter if
in our scheme of things we demand
college news first and college liter
ature second, trusting to Provi
dence from week to week to supply
the necessary fifteen cents for col
lege fun. Nor can we bring our
selves to believe that the "dear
eighteen" are on Chappie's books
solely for the privilege of being
"loved back at."
Lastly, Chappie would be surer
of our sympathy, and incidentally
of our two dollars, if he kept before
him even in his jokes the Stanford
ideal of true courtesy.
Stanford Woman.
