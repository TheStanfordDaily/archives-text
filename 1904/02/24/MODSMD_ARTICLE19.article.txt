The baseball candidates at tbe
University of California are being
rapidly rounded into shape by the
coach, and the team in assuming
definite form. Hatch, who did the
catching on last year's varsity
team, has left college, and his place
will be filled by Bliss, the varsity
second-baseman. The loss of
Hatch leaves but three varsity
men on the team —Heitmuller,
Bliss, and Adams. Heitmuller and
Bliss will form the battery, and
Adams will occupy his old position
at short-stop. The most likely
candidates for the remaining in
field positions are all freshmen.
They are: Graham, first base; i 1 lis,
second base; and Strub, third base.
There are a large number of candi
dates for the outfield, but none
have shown enough ability to en
sure a place on the team.
The California fraternities have
organized a baseball league and
will play a series of games to de
cide the championship. The win
ning team will in all probability
play the winner of the Stanford
league.
