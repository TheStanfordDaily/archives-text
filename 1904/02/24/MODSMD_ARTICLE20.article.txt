Hereafter the emblems on the
varsity sweaters at the University
of California will designate the
branch of athletics in which the
sweaters were won. This was de
cided recently at a meeting of the
executive committee of the Associ

was adopted is as follows:
"All sweaters for athletic con
tests will be blue, with the 'C' de
signed as follows for the different
events: Baseball, round C; football,
block C; track, rectangular C; ten
nis, oblong 0; football second
eleven, German C. Instead of
striped jerseys for the track ath
letes, there will be plain blue, on
which the 'C' will be placed when
the wearer has earned it. Cap
emblems will all have the mono
gram 'U. C.' in which will be 'T'
for track men, a tennis racket for
tennis men, a football for football
men, and a baseball for baseball
