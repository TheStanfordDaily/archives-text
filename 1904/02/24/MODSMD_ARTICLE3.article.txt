# TRACK MEET SATURDAY.
## Non-Fraternity Men Will Meet Men of Fraternities on the Track in the Morning. 
### 
On Saturday morning the track
men of the fraternities will meet
the non-fraternity track men in a
field meet on the oval at 10 o'clock.
Preparations have been made by
trainer and captain for a meet
every Saturday during the season.
Besides affording an opportunity
for the trainer to note the progress
of the men, (he coming meet will
be of interest on account of the
friendly rivalry that will be
aroused. The meets held earlier in
the season have been successful,
both in bringing out new men and
in the records that have been made,
and it is the intention of both
trainer and captain to accustom
the men to competition by making
them participate in the weekly
meets.
The meet on Saturday promises
to be very close, as both sides have
strong men. Dole, '04, Crossman,
'04. Beach, '04, Lanagan, ? 04, and
West, '06, will be the principal
point-winners for the fraternities;
while the non-fraternity men will
have Holman, '04, Gay, '04, Hvde,
'04, Crawford, '05, Bell, '05, Rus
sell, '06, Stiles, '06, Ball, '06, and
Maloy, '06.
The regular intercollegiate order
of events will be held and the reg
ular system of scoring will be used.
All of the men on the track at the
present time will enter the compe
tition.
