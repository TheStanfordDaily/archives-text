# Promenade Concert.
## 
### 
The new band-stand, to be used
for the open-air concert Friday
night, has been nearly completed.
It is being built in sections, and
when set up the platform will be
five feet above the level of the quad
and of sufficient size to accommo
date the entire Band.
Rehearsals are progressing satis
factorily for the concert Friday
night, the program of which will
be published tomorrow. There will
be no admission charged, as the
Band is giving these concerts to
foster college spirit and add an
other feature to the social life of
Stanford.
