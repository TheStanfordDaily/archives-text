# Collegiate Alumnae Meeting.
## 
### 
The California branch of the
Association of Collegiate Alumnae
will hold this month's meeting at
the University of California, on
Saturday, February 27th. This is
pursuing the policy instituted by
the board of last year, that the
association visit Stanford one year
and California the next, in order to
become acquainted with the college,
and, at the same time, to meet the
senior women. Last year the March
meeting was held at Stanford.
The program at the California
meeting follows: Personally con
ducted walks in the morning; lun
cheon prepared by students at
12:30 in Hearst Hall; address of
welcome, by Professor Lanpe at
2:30; response, by Miss K. Chand

ler, '00; "The Work of the Associ
ation of Collegiate Alumnae," hy
Dr. Jessica Peixotto, instructor in
the State University; social hour
and tea, for senior women and
graduate women students of Cali
fornia, at 3:30.
On the last Saturday in April
the association will give its annual
reception to the senior women of
both Stanford and California, at
the residence of Mrs. C. \V. Slack
in San Francisco.
Within the next month the asso
ciation expects to post at California
and Stanford a list of occupations
other than teaching that women of
training find profitable. The com
mittee has undertaken this work
because so many graduates drift
into the school-room because they
do not know what else to do.
