# LANAGAN TO COACH AGAIN.
## Will Direct the Work of Football Men During the Next Season. 
### 
J. F. Lanagan, '00, lias been en
gaged to coach the football men
next season. Treasurer Cowden
lias completed all the preliminary
arrangements, which were approved
by the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students last night, and
a contract will be signed within a
few days. Lanagan will continue
his work at Belmont as he did last
year, but his labors will probably
be a little lightened and he will be
able to devote more time to the
task of coaching. The early set
tling of these preliminary matters
•will allow Lanagan to make all his
arrangements and be fully prepared
to commence his coaching as soon
as the men come out at the begin
ning of the fall semester.
Lanagan was graduated from
Stanford in 1900. During his un
dergraduate career he was Varsity
baseball pitcher. He played some
football, but never made a Varsity
team, being compelled to stop be
cause of a weak heart. Last year,
when Stanford was seeking a foot
ball coach, Lanagan was selected
as the best man of the few avail
able because of his known ability
as an organizer and disciplinarian,
and his power of handling men.
His work from the first was a sur
prise and a revelation. His first
success was the Freshman team,
which defeated the California
freshmen with very little trouble.
Lanagan then took a squad of men
that contained only the nucleus of
a team and few stars, and out of it
he developed a Varsity team that
was fully the equal of the Califor
nia eleven. His methods were in
their thoroughness entirely differ
ent from what had been seen in
Stanford coaching in the past. He
taught the men the game from the
very beginning. Varsity man and
Freshman were treated alike. As
a consequence the men worked to
gether well, and the team that was
developed was one of the best all
round fighting teams that ever
represented Stanford in a football
contest.
