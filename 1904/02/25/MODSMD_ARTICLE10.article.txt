# Kilties Seats on Sale.
## 
### 
The advance sale of seats for the
Kilties concert, to he given in
Assembly Hall, Friday evening,
March 4th, will begin Monday
morning at the Bookstore and at
the Stanford Pharmacy in Palo
Alto. This will he the second
appearance here of this famous
organization, the first concert being
one of the most successful, both from
an artistic and a financial stand
point, ever held in Assembly Hall.
With the band that provided the
program last year there now comes
an additional troup of singers and
dancers who present refined Scot
tish vaudeville. The performance
has been so modified that the band,
instead of being the main attrac
tion, has given way largely to the
vocal choir of sixteen voices, sword
dancing, and the Clan Johnstone
vaudeville troup.
While the Kilties Band is essen
tially a Scottish organization, clas
sical and popular airs from Italian,
German and American masters are
rendered. The full program will
be published next week.
