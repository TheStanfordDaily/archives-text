Thk news that Lanagan has been
engaged as head football coach for
1904 will he received by all Stan
ford men, undergraduates and
alumni, with the greatest pleasure.
It means that the football outlook
is brighter than it has been before
in several years. Last year we be
gan the season with Lanagan as
our head coach, but under different
conditions. Then it was recog
nized that he had executive ability,
but his experience as a football
coach was limited to work at a pre
paratory school. When Lanagan
had finished his season's work he
was recognized at Stanford as pre
eminently the man of the hour.
He had come without a reputation,
he had overcome the heaviest odds,
and while'Jhe did not develop a
championship eleven, he made one
that reflected the greatest honor
upon its college and its master.
Next year Lanagan can take up
his work where he dropped it last
season; he will have good material
with which to work, and he has the
power to control men and the
knowledge of football that will en
able him to develop a winning
team. We are glad that he is
coming back, we wish him the
greatest success, and we congratu
late ourselves that we have been
able to secure again the services of
the man who did so much for us
last year.
