California is certainly justified
in the step her executive committee
took at a recent meeting in refus
ing to ratify the agreement reached
at the last meeting of the Intercol
legiate Athletic Committee. But it
is to be regretted that owing to this
action both intercollegiate football
games will be held on the same
college campus. Many undergrad
uates of both colleges will be un
able to undergo the expense of two
trips from one college to the other

while if one game were played on
home grounds and the other on the
grounds of the rival institution
practically every one would be able
to see both games. The decision of
the California committee means
that next year the financial returns
will be larger than they would
have been if the Intercollegiate
Athletic Committee had been sup
ported, but this temporary benefit
will surely be outweighed in the
long run by the inconvenience to
which the scheme will give rise in
years to come.
