Editor Daily Palo Alto:
May I add a word warm off my
heart while it is hot, to the splen
did invective of last evening against
the Chaparral? I have looked
through all the back numbers of
the paper and I found the word
"co-ed" —that defaming, branding,
objectionable word —actually used
once, and that was long ago in a
poem, the next line of which read
''Here's to 'em, God bless 'etn, say
when." Think of it! Drinking to
us in actual beer! I found the un
mentionable epithet "dam" used
once also, and I found it fifteen
times in a single story in the
Sequoia. I think it is perfectly
horrid to have a Chaparral that
carries on this way, and I wish the
office were burned to the ground,
and I don't want Chappie to love
back at me.
Yours truly,
CO-COMMUNICATIONAL.
