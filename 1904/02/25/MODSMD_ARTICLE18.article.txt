Sir Norman Lockyer, in his
presidential address to the British
Association, an extract of which
was published in the foreign notes
of the American Inventor, said:
"Our position as a nation, our
success as merchants, are in peril,
chiefly —dealing with preventable
causes —because of our lack of
completely efficient universities and
our neglect of research.
"If we take the twelve English
university colleges, the forerunners
of universities, unless we are to
perish from lack of knowledge, we
find that private effort during sixty
years has found less than 4,000,000
pounds; that is, 2,000,000 pounds
for buildings, and 40,000 pounds a
year income. This gives us an
average of 166,000 pounds for
buildings and 3,000 for yearly
income. What is the scale of pri
vate effort we have to compete with
in regard to American universities?
In the United States, during the
last few years, universities and
colleges have received more than
4,000,000 pounds from this source
alone.
" When we consider the large
endowments of university education
both in the United States and
Germany, it is obvions that State
aid only can make any valid com
petition possible with either."
