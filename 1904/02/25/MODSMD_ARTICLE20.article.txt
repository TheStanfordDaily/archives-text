The executive and advisory com
mittees of Brown University Cor
poration met last week and passed
resolutions condemning the action
of the board of directors of the
Brown athletic association in re
pealing the rule which debarred
from Brown teams students who
had received money for athletic
services. This means, apparently,
that Brown will go back to her origi
nal eligibility rules, which are very
much the same as those in force at
other colleges,and which debar from
representing Brown on any of her
university teams a man who has
been paid for his athletic services.
