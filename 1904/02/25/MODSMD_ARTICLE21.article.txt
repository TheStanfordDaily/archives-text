The February issue of The World
Today publishes an interesting
item on the finance of college foot
ball, in which the receipts of fifteen
colleges and universities show a
total of almost half a million. The
list from this magazine does not
include the receipts of Columbia,
Princeton, and several other large
educational institutions, and not
any of the small ones.
In concluding his article in re
gard to the final distribution of
these sums the writer speaks as fol
lows:
'"The answers given are practi
cally the same in the ca√üe of the
institutions named. The balance
maintains other college sports like
baseball and track athletics, and
builds permanent improvements
for the athletic department of the
institution. The final responsibil
ity for the expenditure of these
great sums lies, not in the hands of
the undergraduates, but in the
hands of committees of graduates
or of the faculty, or of those mixed
committees of which other than
undergraduates are members."
The figures given were as fol
lows: "University of Pennsylvania,
$68,521.47; Harvard, $57,790.86:
University of Chicago, $54,965.06;
Yale, $50,000.00; University of
Minnesota, $42,066.00; University
of Michigan, $35,000.00; Univer
sity of California, $21,640.93; Cor
nell, $18,572.81; Northwestern,
$16,000.00; University of Wiscon
sin, $13,000 00; University of Illi
nois, $12,000.00; University of
Kansas, $8,335.00; University of
Missouri. $7,557.97; Williams Col
lege, $5,500.00; Amherst College,
$4,291.15."
Stanford's gross receipts during
the past season amounted to a total
of nearly $15,000.00.
