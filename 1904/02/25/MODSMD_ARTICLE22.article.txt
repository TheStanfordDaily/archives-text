### 
Word has been received from
W. \V. Burnett. ex-'OO, of the death
of William Alfred Wrigley, ex-'Ol,
at Casa Grande, Arizona. At the
time of his death he was in the
company of R. W. Hartwell, ex-'OO.
Wrigley took an active interest in
athletics while at Stanford. He
played at guard on his class foot
ball team, and pitched for his
freshman baseball team, which
won the interclass championship.
He pitched for the Varsity team in
some of the preliminary games in
1898. Wrigley was one of the vol
unteers from Stanford who saw
service in the Philippines, but after
the close of the war he did not re
turn to college.
