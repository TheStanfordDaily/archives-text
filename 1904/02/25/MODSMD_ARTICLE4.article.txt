# WANTS BOTH GAMES.
## California Refuses to Ratify Action of Intercollegiate Athletic Committee. 
### 
At the meeting of the Intercol
legiate Athletic Committee held in
San Francisco January 23d it was
decided that the annual intercol
legiate Freshman football game
should hereafter be held alter
nately on the campuses of Stanford
and California; the game in 1904
to be played at Stanford. The ex
ecutive committee of the Associated
Students of the University of Cali
fornia, at a meeting Tuesday night,
refused to ratify the action of the
Intercollegiate Athletic Committee,
and agreed to hold strictly to the
former agreement, which provided
for the holding of the Freshman
game of 1904 on the California
campus.
The Varsity football game is
also scheduled to take place on the
California campusâ€”which means
that both football games will here
after be played on the same cam
pus the same year. Had Cali
fornia ratified the action of the In
tercollegiate Athletic Committee
there would have been one intercol
legiate football contest at each uni
versity each year. California's re
fusal to ratify the plan of the
Intercollegiate Athletic Committee
was based upon the fact that the
financial returns of the game will
be much greater at California than
at Stanford.
According to the regulations
which govern changes in the inter
collegiate agreement, no alteration
made by the Intercollegiate Ath
letic Committee will stand unless
it he approved by the executive
committees of both California and
Stanford. Since by the former
agreement both football games aie
scheduled for the California cam
pus in 1904, the refusal of either
executive committee prevents the
Freshman game from being played
on the Stanford campus this year.
