# WILD PLAY BASEBALL.
## Big Game to Take Place for the Benefit of Girls' Tennis Club. 
### 
A big baseball game will be
played on the campus diamond on
Tuesday afternoon, March Bth, be
tween the Varsity and a team every
man of which is a star. The game
will be for the benefit of the Girls'
Tennis Club, the receipts to be used
for the construction of a good ten
nis court upon which the girls may
practice for their games with Cali
fornia.
The remarkable composition of
the team, it is expected, will
very likely make the game almost
as interesting as an intercollegiate
contest. The line-up will be as
follows: Catcher, W. T. Reid, Jr.;
pitcher, J. F. Lanagan, '00; first
base, D. V. Cowden, '03; second
base, A. B. C. McGilvray, ex-'O4;
Bhort-stop, Charles Doyle; third
base, P. l\ Parker, '03; right field,
Major Collins; center field, not
chosen.
Reid, who will be behind the bat,
is one of the finest amateur players
of America. He was catcher for
Harvard for four years, and was
captain of the Harvard nine in his
last year. Lanagan, who will
pitch, was Varsity pitcher at Stan
ford, and has been playing with
different teams since his gradua
tion. Cowden was one of the best
first-basemen the Cardinal ever had.
He was Varsity captain two years
ago. McGilvray, who will cover
second base, is more familiar to
Stanford eyes behind the bat, where
he played for the Varsity while in
college. Parker, at the third base,
is also in a new position. He
pitched for the Varsity for three
years, until last year. Major Col
lins is an old West Point man, now
military instructor at the Belmont
School and familiar to Stanford
as the umpire of many of the foot
ball games last season. Brown,
who will play center field, held
that place as a Varsity player.
He was captain of the Varsity team
last year.
A delegation representing the
Girls' Tennis Club appeared before
the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students last night and
asked for aid in the building of a
new tennis court. They said they
were planning an entertainment
that would cover a part of the ex
pense. Treasurer Cowden an
nounced his big benefit game,
which is expected to bring in a
large sum, and in addition a con
siderable contribution is to be
made by the men of Encina Club.
From these three sources it is be
lieved that more than sufficient
money will be realizpd to cover
the expense of the court. Treas
urer Cowden was instructed to pro
ceed with its construction at once.
The court will be of the dirt-and
oil kind now being constructed in
front of Encina Hall.
