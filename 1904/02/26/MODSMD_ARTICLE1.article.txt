# VARSITY VS. SANTA CLARA.
## Fourth Game of the Series to Take Place on the Campus Tomorrow at 3. 
### 
The Varsity will play Santa
Clara tomorrow afternoon in the
fourth game of the series. The
teams are now even, as each nine
hits won one game, and the third
game resulted in an eleven-inning
tie. Stanford won the first game
from Santa Clara by the close score
of 11 to 10; Santa Clara won the
second game, 8 to 4; and the third
game resulted in the score of 4 to 4,
after eleven innings of fast play.
The first two games were played at
Santa Clara, and the third on the
campus diamond.
Santa Clara's team will be prac
tically the same as that which
faced the Varsity in the previous
games. The man who will do the
pitching for Santa Clara has not
yet been decided upon. YVallman
and Emerson are the regular
pitchers; and Chase, the second
baseman, is sometimes tried at this
position. Emerson is the most
likely man to be seen in tomorrow's
game, as he has not pitched against
the Varsity this season. Wallman
pitched the first and third games
for Santa Clara, and Chase pitched
the second game. Santa Clara's
team is being coached by Williams,
who was substitute pitcher for Cal
ifornia two years ago, but left to
play professional ball.
'The line-up of the Varsity has
been changed at three positions
from that of the last game. Sales
will do the pitching, Blake will be
on first, and Knight in right field.
The Varsity infield, except first
base, will be unchanged, as the
men are now playing well together.
-Williams at second and Trow
bridge at short-stop play their po
sitions particularly well. Stott
has been ill and unable to practice
during the past week, and be will
not be seen in the game tomorrow.
The weakest point of the Varsity
in the last game was the poor run
ning of bases, and Coach Doyle has
been instructing the men on this
point.
The line-up of the two teams is
as follows:
Santa Clara —Emerson or Wall
man, pitcher; McKune, catcher;
Feeney, first base; Chase, second
base; Griffin, third base; Farry,
short-stop; Clynes, left field; Dur
fee, center field; Russell, left field.
Stanford —Sales, pitcher; Ball,
catcher; Blake, first base; Wil
liams, second base; Swain, third
base; Trowbridge, short-stop; Chal
mers, left field; Wirt, center field;
Knight, right field.
