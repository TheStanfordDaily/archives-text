Ax the close of the Freshman-
Sophomore baseball game there
was a struggle between the mem
bers of the two classes for the
possession of the ball. In most re
spects the contest was good
natured, fair, and sportsmanlike;
but one of the players on the
Sophomore team missed his cap
with the class numerals on it, and
found that it had been taken, pre
sumably by a Freshman, during
the course of the scrimmage. Since
that time he has refrained from
expostulating, in the expectation
that whoever had his cap would
have decency enough to return it.
No return has been made, however
up to the present time. The offense
was great enough, and it is to be
particularly regretted that the
offender has not realized his error
and returned the cap. It can be
of no value as a trophy, it was not
taken in a fair struggle, and the
man who possesses it has no right
to the emblem which it carries.
When, in a supposedly good-nat
ured struggle, one Stanford man
will steal another's athletic emblem
and keep it, things are decidedly
on the retrograde, and it is to be
hoped that the man who has made
the mistake was misled by inexper
ience and will make haste to repair
the error he has committed.
