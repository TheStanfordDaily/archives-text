# TRACK MEET TOMORROW.
## Fraternity Men to Meet Non-fraternity Athletes on Track Saturday Morning. 
### 
At ten o'clock tomorrow morning
the fraternity track men will meet
the non-fraternity men in the third
preliminary field meet of the semes
ter. The meet tomorrow will prob
ably be the closest held thus far,
as the competitors are evenly
matched in strength. The non
fraternity men have a larger num
ber of men on the track, but this
seeming advantage is offset bv the
fact that the fraternity men have
the majority of the Varsity men.
Several of the events are unevenly
balanced, because the fraternity
men are strong in the sprints, while
the non-fraterhity men have the
greater number of the distance run
ners.
The officials for the meet tomor
row are: Timers, Dr. Angell,
Trainer Moulton; starter, Cantwell,
'02; clerk of the course, Lousley,
'05; announcer, Long, '05; judges
of finish, Professor A. W. Smith,
Assistant ;Professor Searles, and
Chappel, '01; judges of field events,
Ball, '04, Bansbach, '04, Blake, '04,
Cowden, '03, Cromwell, '04, and
Jacobs, '04.
The relay will count five points
and the other events the regular
number —three places only being
given points. The events will be
run in the intercollegiate order.
