# PRELIMINARY TRY-OUTS.
## Debate Will Be Held Tomorrow Night to Decide Upon Men for Finals. 
### 
The preliminary try-outs for the
Intercollegiate debate will be held
in the chapel tomorrow evening at
7:30. A number of the men who
were originally entered in the pre
liminaries have withdrawn their
names, so that there remain but
twelve men to compete. Of these
six are to be chosen who will enter
the finals to be held March 19th.
Five men are already eligible for
the finals on account of their con
nection with the Carnot team,
namely: F. Roehr, '04, H. M.
Lewis, '04, A. Sherriffs, '05, O. H.
Ritter, '04, and A. M. Dibble, '05.
As a result of the falling off in
the number of men to compete,
there will be but two squads tomor
row evening, instead of three as
originally planned. The first and '
third groups, which were assigned
the same subject, will be merged
into one. Following are the squads
as they will be:
