# No Meet with Washington.
## 
### 
It is not probable that there will
be a track meet between the teams
of Stanford and the University of
Washington, owing to the fact that
the contest can not be arranged to
take place before Stanford's con
test with the University of Cali
fornia. Washington and California
have arranged for a meet on April
30th, two weeks after the regular
intercollegiate contest. There is a
general disinclination among many
of the track men, however, to re
main in training after the inter
collegiate event, which would com
pletely overshadow any later meet
in interest. For this reason it has
practically been deckled to carry
negotiations no further.
The status of the negotiations
with the University of Nevada re
mains unchanged. There is a gen
eral desire to have this meet if it
can be arranged to come before the
Stanford-California contest. The
student body treasurer two weeks
ago gave the Nevada manager an
option on the only day available
in the Stanford schedule. Nevada
has not yet replied.
