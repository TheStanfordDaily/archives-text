# JUNIOR WILL BE GIVEN.
## First Class Dance to Be Held in Encina Gymnasium on March 25th. 
### 
At a meeting yesterday, the Jun
ior Prom committee decided to give
the annual Junior dance on Friday
evening, March 25th. This is the
date of Junior Day, which has
been made a holiday by the Uni
versity authorities. The dance will
be given in Encina Gymnasium,
which will be appropriately decor
ated and fitted up for the occasion.
It was not possible to secure the
Encina Hall club-room on account
of the limit placed on the number
of dances that may be held there.
The floor of the gymnasium is to
be scraped and waxed, and it is
expected that it can be putin good
condition. The scheme of decora
tion has not yet been decided.
One corner of the main floor will
be reserved for the use of chape
rons, and chairs and couches will
be placed around the sides for
general use.
Dancing will begin promptly at
7 o'clock, and will continue until
midnight. Yanke's orchestra of
ten pieces will be engaged to fur
nish the music. There will be
twenty-two dances.
Supper will be served on the
second floor of the gymnasium. It
is planned by the committee to re
move some of the apparatus on this
floor and to putin two long tables
at which the guests will be served.
This will be done unless the at
tendance at the dance proves too
large.
