# UNDER-CLASSMEN ON TRACK.
## Dual Meet Will Be Held Tomorrow Afternoon Between Sophomores and Freshmen.

supremacy on the oval with the
Sophomore candidates. The meet
will begin at 3:30, and all of the
events will be held in regular order.

decide the championship between
the two under classes, besides en
abling the trainer and captain to
find out what progress the new
men have made during the first
month of the season. Six men
from each class will be entered in
the relay race, and each of the con
testants will run 220 yards. The
full distance in the hurdles will be
run tomorrow for the first time
this season.
