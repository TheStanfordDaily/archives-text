The traditional rivalry that
exists between the Sophomore mid
Freshman classes should be suffici
ent to ensure at the track meet to
morrow both a wide attendance
and an enthusiastic support of the
contesting teams. But it is desir
able that these track contests
should be received as University
events of broad importance and
should be given the support of the
whole student body. It is unques
tionable that the scheme of holding
frequent meets, in order to famil
iarize the inexperienced men with
a struggle against opponents, and
to enable the trainer to watch the
progress of the candidates as he
could do in no other way, is one of
great wisdom. The meets do much
to relieve the tedium of daily train
ing; and if the community evinces
a proper interest in the contests,
they are sure to be very generally
successful.
