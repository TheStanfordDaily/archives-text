In the Inst issue of the Daily
Palo Alto, editorial comment was
directed toward a man who had
taken the cap of a Sophomore
baseball player in the scrimmage
which followed the first interclass
game. It is to the credit of this
man that when his attention was
called to the fault he retrieved his
error by restoring the cap to the
custody of its original owner as
soon as possible.
