# Candy Fair Saturday.
## 
### 
The candy fair which was held
last Saturday afternoon on the
porch of the Stanford Inn proved
a great success, despite the rain.
Full reports of the results of the
fair have not been made, but it is
thought that a sum of one hundred
dollars was cleared over expenses.
The money will be used in buying
furniture, and in otherwise tilting
up the Women's Rest-room on the
quad.
