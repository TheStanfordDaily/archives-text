# Win Return Tennis Match.
## 
### 
The Iloble tennis squad was vie-

torious in the return match played
with the Belmont Tennis Club at
Belmont last Saturday. The teams
were more evenly matched than in
the first meet, and the Stanford
girls had hard work in winning
from the Belmont players. The
first set was played by Miss G.
Pitman, '05, and Miss M. Ray, '05,
opposed to iMiss Splivalo and Miss
Hayward, '06, of Belmont. The
score was 6-0,5-7, and 6-1. The sec
ond set was played by Miss D. Ab
bott, '06, and Mrs. Miller, Michi
gan 1895, against Miss Thompson
and Miss Jewel of Belmont. The
score was 6-1, 6-2. Instead of the
two winners playing a deciding
match, as had been planned, the
contest ended at this point, and to
decide the championship a tourna
ment will be held on the Roble
court in the near future between
one team composed or Miss Pitman
and Miss Ray, and another made
up of Miss Abbott and Mrs. Miller.
