# No Prize Poem.
## 
### 
Because of the inferiority of the
poetry written by undergraduates
during the pa6t year, the 1905
Quad will not print the traditional
prize poem. Dr. Anderson, Dr.
Alden, and Instructor Seward, all
of the faculty of the English de
partment, were the committee
asked to decide upon the prize
story and the prize poem. All of
the poems which have appeared in
the Sequoia and Chaparral within
the past year were eligible in the
contest, besides a number written
especially for the competition. This
is the first year since the custom
has been followed of awarding cash
prizes for a poem and story for the
Quad, that no poem has been found
worthy of selection.
