# DEBATERS SELECTED.
## Six Men Chosen to Compete with Carnot Team in Intercollegiate Finals. 
### 
The preliminary try-outs for the
selection of six debaters who will
compete with the five Carnot men
in the finals were held in the chapel
Saturday night. Ten men entered
the contest, and the following were
chosen by the judges: R. G. Bar
nett, '05, 1). S. Sales, '06, P. D.
Swing, '05, \\\ L. Blair, '05, E. A.
Cunha, '06, and C. S. Osgood, '06.
The ten contestants were divided
into two squads, and three men
were chosen from each division.
The first squad debated the ques
tion, "Resolved, That the United
States was not justified in recog
nizing the independence of Pan
ama." Of the successful speakers
on this question Sales and Osgood
supported the affirmative and
Cunha the negative.
The second squad debated the
question, "Resolved, That the labor
unions, as they exist today in the
United States, are detrimental to
the interests of labor." Blair,
Swing, and Barnett, supporting the
negative,were the successful speak
ers on this squad.
The number of speakers entered
in the preliminary try-outs this
year was considerably less than
that of the last two years, but the
showing on the whole was above
the usual standard. All the
speeches showed thorough prepara
tion and a complete grasp of the
subject in hand. In delivery and
form the speakers showed ability
that compared very favorably
with the work done in past pre
liminary contests. The speakers
who made the first six places did
not stand out pre-eminently above
the others, a fact which tends to
show that there is in college an
unusual number of strong debaters
from which the teams can be drawn
during the next two years. The
decision of the judges was rendered
only after lengthy deliberation.
The final try-outs for the selec
tion of three men and an alternate
to compose the 1904 Intercollegiate
debate team will be held in about
three weeks. There will be eleven
men in tlie competition. In addi
tion to those chosen Saturday
night, F. ltoehr, '04, H. M. Lewis,
'04, A. Sherriffs,'os, O. H. Ritter,
'05, and A. M. Dibble, '05, who
debated in the Carnot finals will,
speak.
