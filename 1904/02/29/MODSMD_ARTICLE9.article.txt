### 
Rev. Dr. (J. C. Adams of the
First Congregational Church of
Sao Francisco preached in Memo
rial Church Sunday morning. His
text was from Matt, v, 4: "Blessed
are they that mourn, for they shall
he comforted." Dr. Adams said
that the first factor in instruction
is the personality of the teacher.
Because of that fact, God has given
us the Man, Christ, to teach us hy
impressing us with His personality.
It is the individuality of the Man
and not particularly what He did
that makes Him so attractive and
Hi« teachings so widely accepted.
The Beatitudes seem peaceful,
calm, heathful; hut they were
really the most revolutionary ut

terances ever made—in direct an
tithesis to the belief of the day.
Blessedness of affliction was a new
doctrine. The philosophy before
that time is illustrated in the Hook
of Job, where all afflictions were
pronounced to be the result of com
mission of sin, and every suffering
by an individual to be caused by
his own sin. Man, poor in spirit
or in purse, was considered cursed.
The rich only were blessed. When
Jesus blessed those who had been
considered cursed, it amounted to
a complete revolution.
Certain natural disasters come to
all, regardless of their spiritual or
moral condition. The important
thing is the spirit in which the
misfortunes are received, and the
blessing is not in the affliction
itself, but in the way in which it is
accepted.
Formerly men killed one an
other with spears. Now, said Dr.
Adams, we stab one another with
the tongue. We still kill, but we
do it more scientifically. "He who
hateth his brother without a cause
is a murderer in his heart." The
same spirit, the same meanness
and lowness of purpose, still exist.
We have gained in our capacity for
self-control, hut have we advanced
in spiritual control? Does not the
same spirit exist which in former
daj's would have driven our spears
into our adversaries? The sav
age's capacity for. suffering is only
at the point of the spear. Hut
with the broadening of the intellect
and refinement our capacity for
suffering is increased and height
ened. Develop any human being
in any particular line, especially
in any moral line, and his sense of
suffering is refined.
"For they shall be comforted."
The etymology of the word "com
forted" shows that its original
meaning was to make strong, to
put energy into. Jf a man loses a
leg or a nose it can be replaced ar
tificially, but if he loses his hack
bone he is done for. The Christian
religion is intended to make verte
brate animals. "We have had
enough gospel of the jelly-fish spe
cies," said Dr. Adams. "If Jesus
Christ had been merely good, His
teachings would never have sur
vived; but the elements of strength
and courage which he promul
gated have been their greatest fea
ture."
