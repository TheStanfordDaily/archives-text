# BOATING WILL BEGIN.
## Candidates Will Hold Regular Practice Next Thursday.â€”Professor Smith Will Coach. 
### 
The plans of the Stanford Boat
Club have matured, and regular
practice will begin Thursday on
Lagunita. The lake is filled with
water, and the boat-house ia prac
tically ready for use. The original
plan of moving the house to the
southeast corner of the lake has
been abandoned, and the building
is being renovated in its old loca
tion. An additional fioat will be
built so that easy handling of the
boats and safe change of crews will
be facilitated.
The boat-house will befitted with
lockers, and candidates will he
saved the inconvenience of using
the gymnasium as a training-house,
as was done last year. Arrange
ments have been made with the
gymnasium management whereby
those training for the crew will be
allowed to substitute rowing for in
door gymnastic work. As in other
departments of athletics, the candi
dates must come out five times a
week for an hour of credit.
The practice hours will be from
4to 6. Professor A. \V. Smith will
act as coach throughout the season.
He is a man with a large amount
of experience in boating, was a
member of Cornell's first victorious
crew, and has kept in touch with
this department of athletics during
later years.
The two new pair-oared boats
have not arrived, but they are ex
pected within a week. In the mean
time the candidates will use the
boats secured last year, both of
which are barges, one a four-oared
and the other a two-oared boat.
The new men will use the old boats
until they acquire a certain degree
of proficiency.
By the time the class regatta is
held, during the latter part of
April, the coach expects to have a
number of men in good condition
for the intercollegiate try-oats.
It is (he purpose of this class
regatta not only to arouse an inter
est in boating, but also to develop
men for the coming intercollegiate
contest. There is a bare possibility
that jin intercollegiate Freshman
race may be arranged this spring
with the University of California.
The boat Club this year will be
conducted on a different basis from
the plan used last year. All those
enguged in rowing must be
come members of the club, and pay
an initiation fee of $2. The monev
raised will be used to pay for the
new boats and to meet current ex
penses. The Boat Club does not
wish to call upon the student body
for support until the sport is found
ed on a solid basis, when intercol
legiate regattas will be among the
regular athletic contests with Cali
fornia.
