The editors of the Daily Palo
Alto announce with pleasure the
election to the board of D. M.
Davis of Los Angeles, California.
Of those who were entered in the
competition, which began at the
first of the semester, a great many
became easily discouraged, and
others for a multiplicity of reasons
gave up the struggle, but for the
work which they did it is to be
hoped they will find sufficient
recompense in the experience and
acquaintance with University
affairs their efforts gave them.
Following the custom instituted
by the last editor of the paper, a
strict credit system has been given
for news that the unaided efforts
of the candidates have enabled
them to discover; for the regular
detail work of the paper they were
given half credit only. Unques
tionably this system, when finally
perfected, will result in an almost
faultless covering of the news field
of the University. Another and
fyial competition for the pres
ent semester will begin Monday
afternoon. Prospective candidates]
will meet in the office of the Daily
Palo Alto at 1:15, when a full
explanation of the requirements
from candidates and the system
followed in making appointments
to the board will be given. It is
particularly desirable that under
classmen who are interested
in newspaper work, and who
have a natural facility of
expression or have ready access to
some news field of the University,
try out for the staff. For consist
ent and painstaking work which
has lasted throughout the year, H.
P. Bittner, C. M. Hadley, and C. G.
Atwood have been promoted from
assistant to associate editors. The
associate list is now complete, as
the positions are limited to four,
but as the assistant editors are
ranked in the order of merit, and

this ranking is frequently changed
in accordance with the work the
men are doing, the position of first
assistant is almost as much to be
desired as a position on the asso
ciate list.
