Editor Daily Palo Alto:
May 1 present through your
columns a few reasons for the gen
eral dissatisfaction that has arisen I
in the college, and particularly in
the Senior class, as a result of the
unprecedented action of the Senior
Farce Committee. In substituting
the comedy ''Patience" for the |
usual Senior Farce, the committee [
has, firct of all, violated a
Stanford tradition almost as old
as the University itself. One of
the most interesting features of
Senior Week has been flippantly
eliminated, and in its place lias
been substituted a comedy that, at
best, will be produced in a second-1
class manner. At a single stroke
the committee practically killed
all effort on the part of Stan
ford men to produce original work. |
It is true that some Stanford j
farces of the past have been of
inferior merit, but it is also true
that some have been of a very high
order. And now, good and bad,
all must go. Whatever latent abil
ity there may be among Stanford
students, has no incentive to call
it forth other than that offered by
the Junior competition.
In college affairs, precedent is an
important and deep factor. When
a precedent is broken there should
be a substantial reason and a gen
eral demand. Yet in this matter
six students, assuming an author
ity which was never delegated to
them by their class, violated a long
established precedent without even
a wort! of explanation.
And what of the substitute that
has been offered ? The opera
"Patience," is interesting, in spite
of antiquity, but it is at least
questionable whether University
talent can produce it in a credit
able manner. The production of
"David Garrick" was good, but
one who had seen a first-class com
pany of professionals play the
same piece, whatever his personal
relation to our actors, could
not help drawing extremely dis
paraging comparisons. There is no
reason to expect a different result
in the production of " Patience."
To the college community a
first-class comic opera, given in a
second-rate manner, can not begin
to be so interesting as a college
farce, written by a Stanford stu

dent, bristling with college fun and
Stanford color. To the visitor who
may be present during Commence
ment Week the same facta hold
true. They can see a comic opera,
first-class in every particular, at
any time. Much more enjoyable
than this would be a college pro
duction portraying something of
Stanford life, as some Stanford
farces have admirably done in the
past.
In conclusion, I feel that I voice
the sentiment of a large part of the
University community when I de
mand that the committee offer an
adequate explanation for lightly
throwing aside a valued tradition.
I ask that they open competition
and set a date for the handing in
of manuscripts. In case no credit
able production is submitted, there
will still be time for them to pro
duce "Patience," if they are guided
in their later steps toward that end
by the same spirit that, prompted
their first ones. I might add that
I am not a writer of farces, but that
1 do belong to that class of the stu
dent body that would like to see
Stanford customs preserved unless
there is a good reason for their
abandonment.
A Traditionalist.
