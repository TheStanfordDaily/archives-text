At a meeting of the Stanford
Tennis Club last night, the resigna
tion of B. S. Allen, '06, secretary
of the club, was read and accepted,
and H. P. Bittner, '06, was elected
to fill the vacancy. C. H. Baker,
'04, and G. A. Hodge, '06, were ap
pointed members of the tourna

ment committee, the other mem
bers of which are L. H. Roseberry,
'03, A. \V. Hooper, '05, and H. P.
Bittner, '0(5. In the absence of F.
A. Leib, '02, L. H. Roseberry, '03,
gave a report on the progress that
is being made with the new courts
which are being laid out in front of
Encina. If the weather conditions
permit, the oil will be put on in a
few day,and the courts will be ready
for use soon afterwards.
A committee was appointed by
President Roseberry to apply to the
Athletic Committee for new rules
governing preliminary try-outs and
the selection of an Intercolleg
iate team. The present ruling
states, that the two first men in the
singles tournament shall constitute
the doubles team. This has been
found an unsatisfactory rule, as
frequently the two men who play
the best game in singles are not
suited to each other's play, so that
they made a poor doubles team.
The following members of the
tennis squad have been granted
permission to substitute tennis
practice for gymnasium work: C.
H. Baker, '04, F. A. Leib, '02, R.
C. Leib, '04, H. H. Hall, '04, A. W.
Hooper, '05, L. H. Roseberry, '03,
G. A. Hodge, '06, and W. H. Sway
ne, '07.
