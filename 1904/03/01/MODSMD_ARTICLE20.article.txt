# The 						Kilties Band.

### 
Arrangement** are completed for
the concert by the Kilties Band, to
be given in Assembly Hall Friday
evening. The band comes this
year considerably strengthened by
the addition of new musicians and
new specialties, giving a greater
variety of entertainment. The
Kilties need no introduction to a
Stanford audience, as they have
been well received on former occa
sions
The San Francisco Chronicle
spoke as follows of a concert re
cently given in San Francisco:
"Conductor William F. Robin
son and his band of Kilties gave
their second concert last night at
the Alhambra before an audience
that was keenly sympathetic and
appreciative. The plaided lads
seemed inspired by the enthusiasm
of those for whom they played, and
they gave the fine old Scotch folk
songs and the modern compositions
their full value of meaning. Tom
Johnstone gave the sword dance to
the tune of the bag-pipes played by
Pipe-Major Albert Johnstone.
Harry Howe's trombone solo and
Clan Johnstone's Scotch reel and
Irish jig were well received; while
the Kilties choir in 'Robin Adair,'
and J. Coates Lockhart in 'Afton
Water,' sang so pleasingly that
they were encored and re-encored.
Last evening's audience showed
that San Franciscans realize the
unusual opportunity which the
presence of the Kilties gives them
for hearing the simple, meaningful
ballads of the highland folk."
Seats are now on sale at the
Bookstore and at the Stanford
Pharmacy in Palo Alto.
