—Kansas University will send

—A ten-dollar advance in tui
tion was made recently at North
western University, it is planned
eventually to raise the amount
charged in other large colleges.
—The class of 1005 at Harvard
is agitating a return to the inner
quadrangle where are located the
old dormitories which have re
cently been neglected for more pre
tentious buildings on the outside.
—The Phi Beta Kappa society at
Yale, in order to raise wider inter
est in itself among the undergrad
uates, and considering that many
men throw away their charices of
making the society through ignor
ance of the conditions for doing
so, is sending to the students in
the freshman class a printed cir
cular stating the society's require
ments, objects, and privileges. The
social side of the organization is
also being more emphasized than
ever before, and it is hoped that by
increasing interest in itself it may
stimulate a wider intellectual
growth in the university.
