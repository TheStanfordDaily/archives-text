# Poem for "Quad."
## 
### 
The '05 (luad will reprint from
the Sequoia the poem entitled
"Homer in the Original," hy Miss
lrmngarde Richards, '02. The Quad
committee on the prize poem had
selected this one to receive the
award, hut it was later decided that
the work of undergraduates only
could he considered, which barred

the verse chosen. As the committee
had not been informed that the
work of a graduate student would
be ineligible in the competition no
second choice was made, and it was
for this reason, and not because the
poems of undergraduates were uni
formly poor, that no second poem
was selected by the committee.
Last year the committee refused to
select a poem owing to the poor
quality of all the verse submitted
in the contest. The committee in
charge of the selection was com
posed of A. G. Newcomer, associate
professor of English, Dr. 11. M. Al
den, assistant professor of English,
and Instructor Seward of the Eng
lish department.
