In the Sequoia which appeared
today the editorials called atten
tion to the University scrap-books
on file in the library, and touched
upon the postponed Promenade
Concert. The leading article in the
magazine, signed by I. A. W., is
entitled " Stanford Student Life."
It dwells upon the early student
life of Stanford. Miss Edith Mir
rielees, '06, contributes a good story,
" By the Mouth of a Witness,"
which relates the experiences of an
eye witness at the siege of Pekin.
The only piece of verse contained

in the number is "The Night
Attack," by I). M. Reynolds, '05.
F. H. Fowler, '04, contributes a pood
sketch in dialect. An unsigned
article appears on " Track Pros
pects" which shows the healthy
condition of this branch of athletics.
The last article, by Associate Pro
fessor Newcomer, is a review of
the "Habits of California Plants"
by Katherine Chandler, '00.
