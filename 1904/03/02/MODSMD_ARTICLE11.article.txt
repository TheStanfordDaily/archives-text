# Faculty "Chaparral" Will Be Out.
## 
### 
The edition of the Chaparral ed
ited by the faculty will probably
be placed on sale tomorrow. Com
menting on the faculty edition of
the Chaparral, the San Francisco
Argonaut stated that since the
Stanford faculty had never been
celebrated for its humor there was
reason to wonder what the attempt
would he like. The edition is now
ready to be put on sale, and per
haps will be a surprise to the Argo
naut editor and to others who did
not know what fun still lurked be
hind the head professor's frown.
From the first poem to the envoi
the paper is brimming over with
fun, all of it directed at the stu
dents from an essentially faculty
view-point.
The inside of the Registrar's
office divulges its secrets in many
pointed articles, the chief of which
is a "Human Document," made up
of extracts from a series of peti
tions from Johnny Jones, who be
gan by taking twenty-one hours,
and ended with a leave of absence
on account of a sore toe. Extracts
from letters from prospective
freshmen, and answers to corre
spondents, are interesting features
along this same line. Mr. Dooley
on the Honor System is a page of
comment from one evidently not in
sympathy with the proposition.
The leading verse feature de
picts a session of the Committee on
Student Affairs, and cleverly dis
cusses the various failings for
which students "may easily be
spared." "Santa Clara Brumalis"
is the introductory verse of a light
but not humorous nature.
The editors are: David Jordan,
Vernon Kellogg, Raymond Alden,
Albert Smith, Alphonso Newcomer,
Arthur Clark, Frank Angell, Orrin
Elliott, and Robert Snodgrass.
