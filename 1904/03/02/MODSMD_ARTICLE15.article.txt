The continued failure of some
one to come forward us a yell
leader is very much to l>e regretted.
It is only one month until we play
the first game of the intercollegiate
baseball series. Unless something
is done at once, the date for the
game will find Stanford men en
tirely without organization. Not
a cheer has been heard from the
bleachers this season â€”and cheering
is a thing that requires practice if
it is to be done successfully. From
our own observance of what has
happened at other colleges, we
know how disastrous it is to have a
yell leader who, either from lack
of practice or for other reasons,
can not hold the men together and
make them yell in unison. The
only way to remedy the situation
is for some of the upper-classmen
to overcome their sense of modesty,
too strong for the good of the col
lege. Men who have been promi
nent in any line of activity should
Btep out and see what they can do.
"Trying out" is especially impor
tant in a matter of this kind, for it
is essential that the very best man
available be chosen. It is within
the power of the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students
to elect a yell leader, but it is
plain that the man to be elected
should have shown that he can fill
the position. Yell leading is no
trivial matter. A good leader is
liked and respected, and after he
has left is long remembered and
regretted. In the next few days
there will be plenty of opportunity
for candidates to appear, and there
should be the keenest rivalry for
this important place.
