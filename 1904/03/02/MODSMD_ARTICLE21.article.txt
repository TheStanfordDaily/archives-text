Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The communication in last
night's issue of the Daily Palo
Alto on the selection of an opera
for presentation by the Farce com
mittee of the Senior class, as the
writer says, voices the feelings of a
number of the members of the class
of 1904. Something should be done
to preserve the few traditions Stan
ford University enjoys. Just why
this Senior Farce committee fears
that the production of some Stan
ford student will be second class is
not easily understood, for without
question the Senior farces present
ed during the last four years have
been more than creditable to the
University and to the respective
classes. How would the memories
of Erb, Bradley, Adams, and Bow
man have been preserved from
class to class if it had not been for
the college farces? And the later
men, Bonnell, Uenaud, and Young,
were able to prove their worth to
the University in helping to write
and in writing Senior farces. As
these men had their chance, so
should students now in the Univer
sity have theirs. It seems to me,
indeed, that some action should be
taken by the class against the ar
bitrary decision of the Farce com
mittee, that represents but a frac
tion of the feelings of the class.
