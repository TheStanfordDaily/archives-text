Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I am not a member of the Senior
Farce committee, and I am three
fourths a "traditionalist" yet I
favor the action the committee has
taken. I should like to state
why.
The committee proposes frankly
an experiment. But it is not an
experiment that can do serious,
permanent harm. It does not
oommit the University to a fixed
policy of comic operas in the future.
It does not deprive us of a home
made play this year: there is the
Junior Farce. At worst it will be
a favorite musical comedy given as
well as Stanford people can give it
—and there are many worse things
than that.
But may it not lead to something
permanently beneficial? If so, an
experiment is well worth a trial.
"Patience" will give us an oppor

tunitv of hearing a large chorus of
college voices in good, ringing
songs. We don't get enough of
that now. It will give the college
orchestra opportunity of co-operat
ing actively in a Stanford play.
That would he to our advantage us
well as to that of the orchestra. It
will give our best comedians parts
that are worth the time that it
takes to prepare them. Some good
actors, it is said, will not take the
time for the inferior parts of a has
tily put together play.
But what seems most important
to me is the possibility that this
enterprise opens for the future.
The eastern colleges give original
comic operas —give them often and
give them well. They have the
local color, and the fun that the
best of our farces give us, and they
have a great deal more. They have
good plots, good dialogue, good
songs that spread through the com
munity and become college prop
erty. College composers and col
lege dramatists work together long
in advance, and the resulting com
edy is given the best staging and
presentation that the student body
is capable of. Why can not we do
the same here? May not the giv
ing of "Patience" show what are
the possibilities for future develop
ment in the direction of a better
and more ambitious kind of Senior
Farce than an}' that we have yet
had at Stanford? If so, we shall
have much to thank the present
committee for.
There is one suggestion for pres
ent use. Why should not the com
mittee substitute some home-made
Stanford choruses —or solos —for
some of those in the text of "Pa
tience "? Musical comedies are flex
ible things, and can stand adapting.
And why can not an opportunity
be given for college dramatists to
modify the text somewhat, to put
in a dash of Stanford color without
doing violence to the spirit of the
original? Prizes might be given
for such work, and it would he a
step towards a wholly original
play. And a good Stanford song,
if anybody has it up his sleeve, can
not be better introduced than by a
large college chorus behind the
foot-lights, accompanied by the
college orchestra in front.
That is why, though three quar
ters a "traditionalist," I am one
quarter, and that enthusinstically,
An Experimentalist.
