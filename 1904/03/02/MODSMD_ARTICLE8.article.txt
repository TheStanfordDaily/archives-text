# VARSITY IS DEFEATED.
## Santa Clara Easily Wins Fourth Game of Series by Decisive Score of 11 to O. 
### 
Santa Clara administered a
severe defeat to the Varsity yester
day, winning by the score of 11 to 0.
The visitors lead from the first.
They hit safely and made runs al
most at will. Santa Clara scored
in every inning except the fourth,
seventh, and ninth. The Varsity
succeeded in getting a man on third
base twice, but five times Stanford
was retired in one, two, three
order.
The defeat of the Varsity is attrib
uted to inability to hit a left-hand
ed pitcher. Chase, who won the
second game of the series for Santa
Clara, was in the box again yester
day. Trowbridge was the only
Varsity man who was able to make
a hit. On the other hand Santa
Clara batted Sales and Roosevelt
at will, obtaining altogether four
teen hits. The visitors made seven
hits that enabled them to score six
runs in the first two innings.
Roosevelt replaced Sales in the
third inning, but he was also hit
freely, three three-base hits and a
number of singles being credited to
Santa Clara from his delivery.
The game yesterday was the
fourth of the series between Santa
Clara and Stanford. Santa Clara
has won two games, Stanford one,
and the other game was tied.
Should Stanford win the fifth game
of the series, the tie will probably be
played off.
The game played on the campus
this afternoon is the last the Var
sity will play at Stanford this
week. On Saturday Stanford will
play the Independents at the Uni
versity of California, and Califor
nia will meet Santa Clara on the
Stanford campus the same day.
The line-up of the teams yester
day was as follows:
Santa Clara—Chase, pitcher; Mc-
Kune, catcher; Feeny, first base;
