The controversy which has been
agitated in regard to the action of
the Senior Farce committee in de
ciding to present "Patience" in
stead of the usual farce seems in a
fair way to be settled. The position
of those who object to the action of
the committee has been stated in
the columns of this paper, and the
committee publishes a communica
tion in tonight's edition which
makes its position clear. A meet
ing of the Senior class has been
called in answer to a very general
feeling that the discussion be defi
nitely settled by those most inter
ested. No on« now has cause for
complaint, for the decision rests
with the class ,and the voice of the
majority will rule. One thing
should be kept in mind, however.
If the class should decide that the
committee has exceeded its author
ity and should insist upon opening
a farce competition.it should decide
finally upon the action the com
mittee must take. If no creditable
farce is submitted shall a poor one
be presented, or shall the Senior
class disregard precedent and give
a play that is sure to be good even
though it be unoriginal. There is lit
tle question that the majority would
like to see an original Stanford
farce if a good one can be obtained.
Between a poor farce and a produc
tion similar to "Patience," the
farce should certainly be sacrificed.
It is to be hoped that every Senior
in the University will attend the
class meeting tomorrow, for the
question to be decided is of impor
tance not only to the class but to
the whole community.
