The annual dinner of the Stan
ford CI 111) of San Francisco, to be
held at Jules tomorrow night, can
not hut be looked forward to with
pleasure by all who contemplate
attending. In a general way this
annual dinner is an event of un
usual importance and pleasure in

bringing together Stanford men of
past years. An exceptionally
favorable opportunity is offered to
the faculty of Stanford to again
come in touch with their former
students and to keep up the friend
ly relations established when the
business men of today were the
undergraduates of yesterday. The
dinner tomorrow night is of espec
ial interest for the reason that a
movement will be started toward
the selection of permanent Stanford
quarters in San Francisco, where
at all times alumni, faculty mem
bers, and undergraduates may go
and there find Stanford associates.
The idea is certain to meet with
the thorough approval of all Stan
ford men, and it is to be hoped
that it will be carried out tomorrow
night.
