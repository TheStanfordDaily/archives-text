# ALUMNI DEFEATED.
## Varsity Wins a Fast and Snappy Game by Timely Hitting. 
### 
The Alumni team, composed al
most entirely of former California
and Stanford baseball players, was
defeated yesterday by the close
score of 4to 2. Stanford played a
much better game than against
Santa Clara, and the result was in
doubt in the eighth inning only.
The Varsity scored once in the
third inning, and again in the sev
enth. The visitors tied the score
in the first of the eighth on an
error and three hits, one of them
for three bases, by Spencer. With
a tied score in the eighth the game
seemed likely to last over nine in
nings, but Stanford at her turn at
the bat scored two runs on two |
hits, a stolen base, and an error.
At the end of the inning the score
stood 4 to 2, and remained un
changed to the end of the game.
Parker and Cowden were the two
Stanford men on the visiting team.
Parker pitched the first six innings
and held the Varsity down to one
hit and one run. In the seventh
McKay replaced Parker, and al
though the Varsity scored three
runs, they made but three hits off
his delivery. Morse, captain of
the Alumni team, hit safely three
times out of four times at bat.
Tritch pitched a fine game, allow
ing but five hits. Stott was brought
in from the field and tried at first
base, and played this position
without an error, accepting some
hard chances.
The following is tlie detailed
