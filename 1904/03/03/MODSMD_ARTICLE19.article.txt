Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Senior Farce committee
wishes to present the following
statement of its position in regard
to the production of " Patience"
during Senior Week, in place of the
usual farce.
The committee, at its first meet
ing, took what might be termed "a
general account of stock," and as a
result of this accounting it was the
unanimous opinion that the drama
tic outlook, in as far as farces were
concerned, was about as gloomy as
possible. The sum total of all that
could be found out was that, besides
left-overs from previous farce com
petitions,there were just three farces
in sight, and that all three were un
finished. In the past it has usual
ly happened that this time of the
year has found at least one prom
ising author with a completed
farce, or some combination of clever
authors hard at work on one. But
as far as the committee could see
there was no combination such as
Bradley and Erb, or Adams and
Bowman in sight.
Certain members then sounded a
number of persons in college who
have been in close touch with dra
matics,and found no radical objec
tion to departing for once from the
usual custom of putting on an orig
inal farce. In every case, the peo
ple so consulted, as well as every
member of the committee, thought
that a good production of a stand
ard play or comic opera would be
preferable to the production of a
weak farce. Moreover, it was unan
imous in the opinion that local
color and local jokes are far more
suitable to Junior Day, when farce
is strictly an inside college affair,
than to Senior Week, when numer
ous outsiders, invited guests of the
Seniors, who do not understand
the local jokes and allusions, are at
the University. A good farce, such
as the " Princess of Leland," which
has good music and straight come
dy in addition to local color, will
please them; a weak farce with
nothing but local color and jokes
to recommend it, will not.
The committee then considered
the question whether a straight
comedy or a comic opera would be
the more acceptable. From the
showing made by the University
Orchestra at the recent production
of " David Garrick," and from a
canvass of the number of people
now in the University who can
both sing and act, it was decided
that a comic opera could be given
and success/idly at that.
The committee considered the
matter carefully, tried over a num
ber of operas, and finally decided
on " Patience " as the one which
would meet the requirements.
There are a number of changes
to be made in the words of the
opera, which will bring in all the
local color which could be de
sired. The opera in its original
form had local allusions in plen
ty, and these will have to be re
moved and Stanford allusions sub
stituted.
The presentation will not be in
any way second rate. No care or
reasonable expense will be spared
to make it first class, and there is
no reason why this opera cannot be
made as great a success as three
others which have already been
produced here.
In order that no author Bhould
save his manuscript for the Senior
and thus lose his chance to compete
for the Junior farce, the change of

plan was announced before the close
of the Junior competition.
The committee holds that it lias
not exceeded its powers. It was
not appointed at its own solicita
tion, and therefore can not be con
sidered wholly unrepresentative.
Before making its final decision in
the matter, several of its members
endeavored to find out the general
sentiment on the subject by discus
sing the plan with a number of
people whose judgment might be
considered sound, and as a result
of these discussions it felt justified
in taking final action.
This statement of the committee's
stand in the matter is not in reply
to the communication lately in
your columns signed "A Tradition
alist," but as an explanation of the
matter to the Seniors, several of
whom have asked that such a state
ment be made.
It is not the aim of the committee
to violate the wishes of the Senior
class, but the committee holds that
if deciding the question is taken
out of its hands, it must be decided
by the Seniors, and not by commu
nications in the college papers.

there was no combination such as
Bradley and Erb, or Adams and
Bowman in sight.
Certain members then sounded a
number of persons in college who
have been in close touch with dra
matics,and found no radical objec
tion to departing for once from the
usual custom of putting on an orig
inal farce. In every case, the peo
ple so consulted, as well as every
member of the committee, thought
that a good production of a stand
ard play or comic opera would be
preferable to the production of a
weak farce. Moreover, it was unan
imous in the opinion that local
color and local jokes are far more
suitable to Junior Day, when farce
is strictly an inside college affair,
than to Senior Week, when numer
ous outsiders, invited guests of the
Seniors, who do not understand
the local jokes and allusions, are at
the University. A good farce, such
as the " Princess of Leland," which
has good music and straight come
dy in addition to local color, will
please them; a weak farce with
nothing but local color and jokes
to recommend it, will not.
The committee then considered
the question whether a straight
comedy or a comic opera would be
the more acceptable. From the
showing made by the University
Orchestra at the recent production
of " David Garrick," and from a
canvass of the number of people
now in the University who can
both sing and act, it was decided
that a comic opera could be given
and success/idly at that.
The committee considered the
matter carefully, tried over a num
ber of operas, and finally decided
on " Patience " as the one which
would meet the requirements.
There are a number of changes
to be made in the words of the
opera, which will bring in all the
local color which could be de
sired. The opera in its original
form had local allusions in plen
ty, and these will have to be re
moved and Stanford allusions sub
stituted.
The presentation will not be in
any way second rate. No care or
reasonable expense will be spared
to make it first class, and there is
no reason why this opera cannot be
made as great a success as three
others which have already been
produced here.
In order that no author Bhould
save his manuscript for the Senior
and thus lose his chance to compete
for the Junior farce, the change of

plan was announced before the close
of the Junior competition.
The committee holds that it lias
not exceeded its powers. It was
not appointed at its own solicita
tion, and therefore can not be con
sidered wholly unrepresentative.
Before making its final decision in
the matter, several of its members
endeavored to find out the general
sentiment on the subject by discus
sing the plan with a number of
people whose judgment might be
considered sound, and as a result
of these discussions it felt justified
in taking final action.
This statement of the committee's
stand in the matter is not in reply
to the communication lately in
your columns signed "A Tradition
alist," but as an explanation of the
matter to the Seniors, several of
whom have asked that such a state
ment be made.
It is not the aim of the committee
to violate the wishes of the Senior
class, but the committee holds that
if deciding the question is taken
out of its hands, it must be decided
by the Seniors, and not by commu
nications in the college papers.
