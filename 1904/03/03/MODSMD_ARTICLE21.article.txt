â€”The Syracuse daily Orange has
a print shop of its own with tele
graphic facilities. The Michigan
Daily also has its own plant. The
work is done entirely by students,
and the lighter university printing
is handled. The paper is under
faculty control, the former stock
holders having disposed of their
interests for $2,250.
