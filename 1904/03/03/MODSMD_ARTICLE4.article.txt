At a meeting of the Tournament
Committee of the Tennis Club last
night it was decided to hold three
singles tournaments, on March 19th,

March 26th and April 2d, respec

ament will not compete in the
second, and the winner of the
second will not play in the third.
The winners of the three tourna
ments, with C. H. Baker, '04, will
then play a round-robin tourna

who will meet California two weeks
later. By this means all tennis
men will he given a fair chance to
