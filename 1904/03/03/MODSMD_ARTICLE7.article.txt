# TO EXPLORE COAST WATERS.
## Dr. Jordan and Other Stanford Men to Carry on Work for the Government. 
### 
Early next month President Jor
dan will take active control of the
marine exploration party which is
now working on the California
coast on the United States steamer
Albatross. This party is now un
der the control of Professor Hitter
of the University of California,
subject to the general supervision
of Dr. Jordan. Its purpose is to
investigate for the Government the
sunken canyons that are found
along the coast, and to determine
at the same time the nature of the
life of whatever form that is found
in them.
The work of Professor ltitter will
include the coast between San
Diego and Catalina Island. There
Dr. Jordan will take over full con
trol. He will leave the University
about April 10th, and will remain
on the Albatross for about a week,
or until the work is well under
way. He will be accompanied by
Professor C. H. Gilbert, of the
Zoology department, who has been
his associate in many similiar ex
peditions; by Associate Professor
Heath, also of the Zoology depart
ment; and by M. H. Spaulding,'o3,
a graduate student in zoology.
Others also may be taken if their
aid is required. The work of all
these men is purely voluntary.
The most important feature of
the Stanford men's work will be
their examination of Monterey bay.
The work here will be of the most
thorough and comprehensive kind.
The whole floor of the bay will be
covered in the search for all forms
of animal or vegetable life that
may exist there. Santa Monica
bay will also be examined, but not
so much time will be devoted to it
as to Monterey. It is expected that
the whole work will not be com
pleted until August. When it is
finished, full reports will be pre
pared and submitted to the Gov
ernment.
During the summer Assistant
Professor J. 0. Snyder of the Zool
ogy department will undertake for
the Government an examination of
the rivers and streams of north
western California, Nevada and
Oregon.
