# "Alumnus" To Be Out Friday.
## 
### 
The Alumnus will appear next
Friday. The address on "The
Proper Relations of the University
and College Work," which Dr. Jor
dan delivered at the last session of
the Association of American Uni
versities, is printed. One of the
leading articles is a statistical dis
cussion of the comparative size of
classes from the opening of the
University to the present time.
The number of graduates by classes
is also given. Comment is made
on the causes of growth and decline
in certain years. An article on
athletics reviews track and baseball
prospects, and the appointment of
Lanagan as football coach is noted
in an article on the last Assembly,at
which Lanagan was the principal
speaker.
The editorial deplores the long
list of alumni whose addresses are

missing,and suggests theelection of a
permanent secretary by each Senior
class whose duty will include the
task of keeping an accurate and
complete record of all the members
of his class.
