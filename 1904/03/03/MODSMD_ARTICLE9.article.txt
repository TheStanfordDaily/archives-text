# English Club Meeting.
## 
### 
The English Club met at
the Kappa Sigma house last eve
ning, about forty members being
present. Miss MacGillivray of
Palo Alto read stories in Scotch
dialect —extracts from " Wee Mac
gregor," showing the Lowland
tongue of Glasgow; others from
"Kate Carnegie," illustrating the
Highland speech. The club espec
ially enjoyed hearing the "Sermon
Taster," from the "Bonnie Briar
Bush " of lan Maclaren, in whose
parish Miss MacGillivray formerly
lived. Some anecdotes of Dr. Wat
son himself caused hearty applause.
Dr. Little sang his own setting of
a poem by Miss Irene Hardy, who
was formerly an instructor in the
English department at Stanford,
and who was a guest at the meet
ing last night. Later in the eve
ning there was more music—this
time a little Scotch tune, sung by
Miss MacGillivray.
