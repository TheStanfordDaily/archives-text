# Boating Practice Begins.
## 
### 
The first boating practice of the
season took place yesterday after
noon. About forty candidates
turned out for the initial warming
up. Of the men who came out
only a few had suits, so but a small
number were able to practice, and
the old pair-oared barge was the
only boat used. Those who en
gaged in actual practice were as
follows: C. IC. Bee, '07, A. Roseri
feld, '07, F. Zimmerman, '07, 11. A.
Moral), '05, M. M. Stearns, '06, and
W. W. Henley,'os.
Several of the men who tried out
showed evidence of having had
more or less experience. There are
several strong men in the Fresh
man class wfoo have had consider
able experience, and with good
material in other classes, the coach
expects to develop a strong squad.
So many men have come out that
the coach has been forced to arrange
a schedule, so that each man can
know just when he is expected to
practice, thus saving delay in wait
ing for a chance in the boats.
