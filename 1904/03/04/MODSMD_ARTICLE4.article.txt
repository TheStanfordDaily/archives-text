the best farce was awarded to M.H.
Thorpe, '05. The play is an orig
inal one and is entitled "The Man
from Mizzoury." It is a musical
comedy in three acts. The plot,
which is laid at Stanford, is
unique; the characters are taken
from Stanford types. The music,
as well as the play itself, is origi
nal. The action of the piece is

upon strong situations than upon
dialogue. While in no sense an
opera, the play is filled with good
music and catchy songs. In addi

tet's, there will be a chorus of ten
voices, and a special march is be
