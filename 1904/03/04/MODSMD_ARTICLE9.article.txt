# SENIORS VOTE FOR OPERA.
## Class Decides to Stand by Committee in Elimination of the Farce. 
### 
The Senior class met in the
chapel this afternoon and decided
to uphold the decision of the Farce
committee to give the opera
" Patience " instead of the custo
mary farce. The meeting, which
was called by President Brua be
cause of the protests which were
being printed in the Daily Palo
Alto, indicating considerable dif
ference of opinion about the matter,
was attended by about seventy-five
members of the class. When the
meeting was called to order, F. H.
Fowler, chairman of the Farce
committee, stated that he thought
the position of the committee
had been adequately set forth in
the statement printed in last night's
Daily Palo Alto, but he added
some remarks about the dilemma
that confronted the committee and
the poor prospect of securing with
in a reasonable time a farce written
by an undergraduate which would
reflect credit upon the class. He
said the situation was a difficult
one, and the committee stood in
need of the undivided support of
the entire class.
Beyond this statement of the
chairman of the committee, there
was no discussion either for or
against the decision to give the
opera in lieu of the farce. The
matter was called to a vote, and the
result was 50 to 21 in favor of up
holding the action of thecommittee.
A motion was then put to make the
action of the cla"ss unanimous in
support of the committee's action,
and there was no dissent.
