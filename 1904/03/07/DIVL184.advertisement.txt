DO YOU KNOW
That the most wonderful

of the long letters you write, describing the
delightful climate and beautiful piacos.

have learned "to draw the long bow." A

Sunset Magazine
sent them each month will carry conviction
and redeem your reputation for veracity.
It is THE mugazinoof California,—is devot
ed to California and things Californian.
Every number is richly illustrated with
tine engravings of California views,
and every line in it, from the delicious
love story to the weighty article on scien
tific matters, is typical of California.
