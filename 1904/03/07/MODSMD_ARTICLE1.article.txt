tomorrow afternoon between the
Varsity and a picked team con
sisting mainly of Stanford alumni.
This game will be for the benefit of
the Women's Tennis Fund, which
will he devoted to making a new
court.
The Alumni team is composed of
a number of good ball players, and
though they have not played to
gether before, they will prove
formidable opponents for the Var
sity. The six Stanford men who
will play are Lanagan, '00. Cow
den,'o3, Parker, '03, Lowenthal,'o3,
Brown, '03, and McGilvray, ex-'O4.
W. T. Reid, Jr., who with Lana
gan will form the battery, is one of
the finest amateur catchers in
America. He caught for Harvard
for four years, and was captain
during his senior year. Lanagan
will pitch tomorrow. He pitched
against the Varsity when they de
feated the Independents several
weeks ago. Lanagan was Varsity
pitcher here for three years. Cow
den, captain of the '02 team, will
play first base, and Brown, captain
of the '03 team, will be at third
base. Second base will be filled by
McGilvray, who caught for the
Varsity while in college. Coach
Doyle will be seen at short-stop.
In the field will be Lowenthal, who
played left field on the Varsity for
three years, Major Collins of Bel
mont, and Parker, who pitched for
the Varsity during the last three
years.
