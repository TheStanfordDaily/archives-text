The concert by the Kilties Band
in Assembly Hall last Friday
night brought to light something
that is greatly to the discredit of
the community. When the Na
tional Anthem was played the
members of the band arose to show
their respect for what the piece sig
nifies, while some of the audience
remained seated, some arose, and
others hurried for the door in an
attempt to be the first to leave.
This theme has been harped upon
a thousand times, and it seems
particularly lamentable that an
unwillingness to show respect for
our country should exist in a col
lege community. Unless a college
education is a joke it should train
us in the finer things of life, and
not allow a man to sacrifice his
pride and his dignity in an attempt
to be the first at the door. A little
thought devoted to the admirable
things in our daily lives will make
us better able to go out linto the
world and take the places that are
supposed to be the inherent right of
college men. But our lives here
will have been wasted if we delib
erately do those things from selfish
ness that some people do because
they know no better.
