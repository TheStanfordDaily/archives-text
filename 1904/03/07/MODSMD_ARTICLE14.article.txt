# Junior Day " Sequoia."
## 
### 
The next two issues of the
Sequoia will he combined into one
Junior Day issue, to appear about
the 24th of this month. L. M.
Bowman, '01, contributes another
chapter from"The Apocrypha of
Gorman," this time the story of an
unexpected climax in a Junior
Farce which developed a villain
not described in the program.
D. M. Reynolds, '05, has a story
called "An Amateur Bridegroom,"
which is perhaps the best work he
has yet done; it will be illustrated
in half-tone and line-drawing by
W. Li. Borough, '04. Miss E. F.
Wynne, '06, is the author of an
excellent story of boarding-house
excitements, which will be illus
trated by Miss K. E. Traphagen,
? 04. Miss C. M. Lathrop, '06, con
tributes some decorative work. In
all, this will be one of the best
numbers the Sequoia has had this
vear.
