Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The statement in the Daily Palo
Alto of Friday, that I am to have
charge <»112 the preparation of the
Junior Farce, is a mistake.
L. E. Bassett.
The Daily Palo Alto was in
formed hy the Junior Farce com
mittee that Mr. Bassett was to di
rect the production of the play.
Later the committee learned that
owing to the demands of his own
work Mr. Bassett would not be able
to take charge. The committee has
secured the services of Paul Gerßon
of San Francisco to supervise the
training of the cast.
