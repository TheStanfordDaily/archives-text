# The 						Davenport Lecture.
## 
### 
Homer Davenport, the famous
American cartoonist, who is to
lecture on "The Power of a Car
toon" in Assembly Hall next Mon
day evening, March 14th, under
the auspices of the Press Club, has
had an interesting career. His
youth was unpromising. Stalwart,
fascinating, good-natured, keen
witted, he grew up in the little
town of Silverton, Oregon, with n6
fixed purpose. He became in turn
a poor farmer, an indifferent loco
motive fireman, an inferior shoe
maker, and impossible circus clown.
Hidden in the boy's mind had
always been the desire to portray
life and nature with his pencil.
Self-taught, he drew everything
that came before him, and drew
but poorly. It was while he was
in this stage that he obtained em
ployment on the Portland Oregon
ian, only to lose it quickly through
the inadequacy of his work.
Thence to New Orleans, where he
made wretched pictures of prize
fights; thence back to the Pacific
Coast, in San Francisco, where with
the growing power that comes from
constant practice, he drew horses
well; he drifted from place to place,
till at last, in San Francisco again,
he awoke to find his true expression
in caricature. His invention of the
dollar-mark suit of clothes in the
first McKinley campaign would
hava made the reputation of any
man; it certainly aided his. The
Dreyfus trial gave him an oppor
tunity to study the French people
at home; a commission to spend
several months in England enabled
him to study the Englishman most
effectively. Something of the same
clarity of vision and homely wit
that helped to make Lincoln dear
to the American people, the kindly
satire of " Mr. Dooley," and his
own power to reproduce instantly
in a few rapid strokes a face or an
incident, have made his presence
on any stage an assurance to his
audience of the heartiest pleasure.
