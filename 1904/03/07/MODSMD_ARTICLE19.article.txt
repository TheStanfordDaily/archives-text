# ST. MARY'S WINS.
## Defeats California in a Slow Game Marred by an Accident to Catcher Poultney. 
### 
St. Mary's College of Oakland
defeated the University of Califor
nia on the campus Saturday by the
score of 10 to 3. The contest was
marred bv an unfortunate accident
early in the game which took the
spirit out of both teams. Califor
nia had three men on bases in the
third inning when NVultzen for
California hit safely to center field.
The man on third base scored, and
Bliss, who was on second, tried to
make home. The center-fielder
threw the ball to the catcher, Poult
ney, and Bliss dove for the plate,
striking Poultney with such force
that his leg was broken half way
between the knee and the ankle.
The injured player was removed to
the hospital, and latter taken to
San Francisco.
At the time of the accident the
score was two to three in Califor
nia's favor. Heitmuller weakened
when St. Mary's came to the bat
for the last of the third inning and
practically gave the Oakland men
five runs. California did not score
after the third inning, but Heit
muller weakened again in the eight
and St. Mary's scored three more
runs. Ferguson for St. Mary's
pitched a good game, striking out
eleven nun. Heitmuller for Cali
fornia was in poor form, but was
probably affected by the accident in
the third inning.
A good comparison between Cali
fornia and Stanford can not be
drawn at present. California has
a team that with practice will
probably develop into a very strong
nine, but as this was but the second
game of the season, they showed
lack of team work.
