# Gymnasium Club Meets.
## 
### 
At a recent meeting of the Encina
Gymnasium Club, H. A. Smith, '05,
and E. V. Henley, '06, were elected
to membership. Some action has
been taken in regard to the public
exhibition, which the club will give
on April 22d, but nothing definite
has been decided. Six pieces of
apparatus will be tised, and there
will probably be an exhibition of
Japanese fencing. Moulton's dogs
may also perform.
