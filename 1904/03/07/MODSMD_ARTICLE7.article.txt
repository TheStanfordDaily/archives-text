# NON-FRATERNITY MEN WIN.
## Successful Track Meet on Saturday Encourages Both Trainer and Captain. 
### 
It) a one-sided yet exceedingly
interesting field meet on the oval
last Saturday morning, the non
fraternity men defeated the frater
nity track athletes by the score of
70 to 49. The loss of Dole, '04,
materially decreased the chance of
the fraternity men, which with
him in the meet would have been
good. The work of all the men
whs encouraging, especially so in
the distance runs. Previous to
this meet the men have finished
the mile and two-mile runs much
fatigued, while on Saturday, with
the distances increased, the men, in
almost every instance, showed up
strong at the finish. The work of
Powers, '07, in the two-mile run is
particularly encouraging to the
track management. After a weary
grind he finished strong with a full
50-yard sprint.
The surprise of the day was the
440-yard dash, which was won
easily by llussell, '06, with Cross
man, '04, and Freeman, '06, only a
few yards behind. Dunn, '04, did
not run the quarter but took the
220-yard dash and finished the
relay. The performance of Russell
in the quarter makes it highly
probable that he will be the
running-mate of Dunn and Cross
man in the 440-yard dash as well
as in the relay. West, '08, jumped
21 feet 8 inches, which is three
fourths of an inch further than the
distance which won the broad jump
in the intercollegiate meet last
yeaf. The relay racfe was easily
won by the fraternity men. The
