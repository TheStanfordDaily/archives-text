Homer Davenport, who is to lec
ture in Assembly Hall next Mon
day night, is perhaps the greatest
American cartoonist. Davenport
came-originally from a little town
in Oregon. Recently he delivered
a lecture at Portland, and the
Oregonian said of him:
"Mr. Davenport began by telling
the audience how lie endeavored
year after year to get exported from
Silverton with the butter and eggs
which that city sends forth into
the world every day, and how he
each day was returned, while the
butter and eggs stayed. Then he
described his endeavor to draw a
stove for the Oregonian advertising
department, and his narrow escape
from involving that paper in a
damage suit as a result. Then he
related his experience during a
visit to the Marqnam Theatre
years ago, when he and his sister
came to see Clara Morris. Thomas

B. Ileecl was the first statesman to
appear on the bristol-board under
Mr. Davenport's pencil, Mark
lianna followed, and his well
known features were recognized
and applauded by the audience.
Gladstone's striking face had its
story of the artist's visit to the
Grand Old Man, and Thomas C.
Piatt, one of the men who fears
cartoons, was the last public figure
to be conjured up on the easel.
The talk concluded with a funny
reminiscence of the days when
Homer Davenport learned the shoe
maker's trade by sawing wood in
the village cobbler's yard."
