Tomorrow regular exercises will
be suspended out of respect to the
memory of one of the founders of
this University. It will be an
occasion fraught with deep signifi
cance to us as Stanford students,
for it will afford us an opportunity
to make open demonstration of the
respect we feel for that man. That
every one who has lived under the
influence of this red-tiled commun
ity feels a deep respect for Senator
Stanford is unquestioned. It was
not the fortune of us of the later
generation to come into the per
sonal relations with him that
aroused the love of the pioneers.
But the memory of what he stands
for and will continue to epitomize
will live long throughout the coun
try and deep in the hearts of Stan
ford men. Besides the interest that
the speakers will naturally arouse,
we should welcome this opportunity
of giving some open manifestation
of the feeling that must be particu
larly keen upon Memorial Day. It
is to be hoped that every one of us
will attend the meeting tomorrow
night and join in the demonstra
tion directed towards the memory
of one who was most happy when
planning or doing something for
the University.
