The position of the Daily Palo
Alto in regard to the recently
ended controversy concerning the
play to be produced by the Senior
class during Commencement Week
was outlined in an editorial that
was published in the columns of
this paper on the day the Senior
class voted to sustain its committee.
The controversy was ended at that
time, and the Daily Palo Alto
called for the support of all mem
bers of the community in aiding

the committee in its task of produc
ing "Patience." Nevertheless, in
spite of the fact that the contro
versy has been ended, three former
Stanford men in San Francisco
have seen fit to write communica
tions to the editor making plain
the position they hold in regard to
the action of the committee and of
the class. The place these men
held in student body affairs while
in the University and the part they
played in the dramatic life at Stan
ford entitle them to the right to
voice their sentiments in the college
paper when, as alumni, they feel
they have a legitimate cause of pro
test against the action of the under
graduates. This word of explana
tion is given in order that the
communications that otherwise
might seem untimely may receive
their proper weight.
