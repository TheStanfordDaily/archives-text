Editor Daily Palo Alto:
May an alumnus who used to be
mixed rather heavily in the Stan
ford ahow business have a word in
the controversy over the Senior
Farce?
The average Commencement vis
itor comes to the University to he
entertained hy things peculiar to
the college campus, it is doubtful
if he cares especially for amateur
productions of standard plays or
operas. With all due respect to
the ability of our amateurs, the
city visitor can see better produc
tions of these plays at any of the
stock theatres in his own town.
There is not for him even the in
terest in seeing his own friends
perform, which usually saves an
amateur production for the audi
ence. But that note of collegiate
life which is always in the poorest
play written as well as produced
on the cam pus--that has always
an interest for the visitor. You
who now live in it do not appreci
ate, I think, how much the out
sider likes the cloistral atmosphere,
how refreshing it is to him.
The reason given for dropping
the class farce is the undoubted
fact that —with one brilliant ex
ception —our shows, these last two
or three years, have been rather
poor. Such slumps as this occur
in every line of collegiate activity.
They are inevitable in a place that
changes its whole personnel every
four years. There have been times
when there were hardly two really
first-class football players in col
lege—as some of the scores show.
Yet the good football players came
again, and with them the football
victories. And no one, in the time
of that slump, talked of doing
away with the intercollegiate foot
ball game. Again, Stanford has
always been famous for the high
quality of its undergraduate verse.
Yet three or four years ago, there
were so few poets in college that no
poem was thought worthy of the
Quad prize. The poets came again,
nevertheless —and are gone by this
year, judging by the late Quad
award. So it goes, up and down.
It is probable that in a year or so
good farce-writers will come to
Stanford or will lie developed from
material already in college. Hut
a custom suspended in college is
usually a custom dead; and when
the farce-writers come again there
may be some dilliculty in reviving
the class farce.
There is reason, beyond our mere
pleasure in the custom, for keeping
the class farce alive in Stanford as
well as in other American univer
sities. Never in any civilized
country of modern times has the
drama fallen so low as it has in the
UnitedStatesof today. Among those
who follow such things critically,
this is almost an axiom. The past
ten years has hardly seen one new
American play worth the while of
a cultured auditor. And this has
come to pass, I believe, not so much
because the Syndicate encourages
the banal or because our audiences
have bad taste, as because we have
no one to produce the plays —not a
single author who has the combined
ability and training to write a
drama that is at once big, artistic,
and actable. And the hope for a
remedy lies in our universities.
Out of them will come the men and
women with the culture, the art
sense, the bigness of mind to make
a good and vital national drama.
Play-writing is a peculiar form

of the literary art —probably the
hardest form to master. The
university-bred playwrights who
are to lead us out of the wilderness
will begin their work, beyond a
doubt, in tinkering with class
farces. So, it seems to me, every
time we take a step toward the en
couragement of the college play we
take a step toward the encourage
ment of an American drama that
is worth while.
Will Irwin, '99.
