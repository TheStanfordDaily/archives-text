Editor Daily Palo Alto:
This communication is in the
nature of a protest. It is a protest
against a lately developed sentiment
in the Senior class which sounds
the death note of the spirit of '95
and the pioneers. It is a protest
against a listlessness which endures
submission to false and anemic
academic ideals without seeking a
vigorous and healthy originality.
It is a protest against quashing a
Stanford custom and tradition
which has proved as much right to
existence as any custom which
makes the University distinctively
what it is.
Specifically, it is a protest against
the action of the Senior Farce com
mittee in choosing Gilbert and Sul
livan's opera "Patience" to pro
duce in Senior Week, and the ac
tion of the class in sustaining its
committee when the matter came
to a test. The first action was
astonishing, and not to be lightly
considered; the second action is de
plorable, and not to be lightly con
doned. Many people, especially
among former Stanford men, be
lieve these measures to be drastic
ally and essentially wrong,eminent
ly prejudicial to the best interests
of the student body and to the Uni
versity at large.
In fairness to the committee and
class which have chosen to match
precedent with prejudice, they
should have reasons for the objec
tion here raised. Such objections
may have been pretty well threshed
over in the columns of the Daily
Palo Alto, but repetition will do
no harm in a cause of this kind.
"Patience" is worth seeing if
well done. Amateurs in such a
performance can not hope for more
than a limited, relative success;but
it is laughable and contains some
good music. Yet it has no remote
touch of college atmosphere or col
lege life. There is no reason for its
production upon a Stanford stage.
Other plays than those written
by students have been seen in
Assembly Hall, but never in Senior
Week and never without justifica
tion. "Antigone" and"The Knight
of the Burning Pestle" found their
justification in subject, historic
interest, and the fact that they were
produced before a University audi
ence. The "Pirates of Penzance"
does not in any way enter this dis
cussion, as it was not staged with
the official stamp of a class, was
not acted by students, and was not
intended to establish a prece
dent. "David Garrick" was a new
venture and, I have no doubt, suc
cessful, but it could not have been
sufficiently so to abolish in a single
glittering triumph a well-establish
ed college custom handed down to
the recent generation, of which I
made one, by some of the most able
and loyal men that Stanford ever
produced.
Follow out the committee's argu
ment for a moment. When from
various reports the student body
has come to believe that debating
material is weak at the University,
is open competition refused and are
the men sent haphazard to meet
their California antagonists with a
recitation of the "Declaration of
Independence"? When football
prospects promise little, does prac
tice cease and are the brawny ath
letes speeded with cheers to the
Richmond field to try conclusions
with the Blue and Gold at the hon
orable and time-honored game of
■"Puss-in-the-corner"? When the

best the preparatory schools have
to offer teems poor, does the Uni
versity close its gates never to open
them again?
It is a pitiable and unworthy
confession to suggest that origi
nality, creative ability, the one
element in which Stanford — the
old Stanford — gloried and grew
glorious, is dead at the Univer
sity. It is a weak and feminine
plaint to cry that some of the
Senior Farces in theirlustiness and
exuberance have been coarse or
crude. Waiving the point, which
is open to vigorous discussion, they
were college farces and Stanford
farces, full of the sunlight which
glows upon the quad, full of the
frolic of the life we love.
How shall originality prove it
self if it is given no chance? Other
men in other days had theirchance
and proved it. What is this sud
den somnolence that has descended
upon the ranks of the Stanford
men? The class has described the
absurd circle that because there
seems to be rio originality there
shall be no farce, and because there
shall be no farce there can be no
originality.
if the plaint of lack of originality
really rang true, then there are
many recourses which do not ex
tend to the prehistoric period of
"Patience." Many good farces
have been written for Stanford.
C. K. Field, both the Irwins,
Bradley and Erb, and Bowman and
Adams all wrote rattling good far
ces, now all but forgotten. A little
touching up of one of these would
put "Patience" under and not upon
a lasting monument, even then,
perhaps,smiling at the unwarranted
grief of the committee. Further
more, there are plenty of Stanford
graduates of farce experience who
stand ready at the call of assistance.
Finally, to pass by many im
portant considerations, such as the
ethical and national value of col
lege farce-writing, the Senior class
has, ignorantly ( or carelessly, vio
lated a tradition about which some
of the brightest hopes and memor
ies of the college centered. The
committee can not hide behind the
class nor can the class hide behind
the committee. A grievous blow
has been struck at the roots of a
tradition which from year to year
since the beginning has tlowered
beautifully and bountifully with
little variation.
You can not train a custom by
killing it any more than you can
train a child in the name manner.
College customs are the children of

of producing an original and dis
tinctive farce during Senior Week
came of worthy parents and, until
this year's committee rendered its
dictum, was always considered a
welcome and worthy child.
The Senior Farce is not alone
for the Senior class nor for the stu
dent body, but for generations gone
and generations to come. To them
some accounting is due, if only in
the way of listening to communi
cations such as this, which the com
mittee has expressed itself as averse
to hearing or heeding.
If there be any who love Stan
ford in all the ways that love can
be tendered, let the Senior Farce be
brought back. R. E. Renaud.

be tendered, let the Senior Farce be
brought back. R. E. Renaud.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
This communication is in the
nature of a protest. It is a protest
against a lately developed sentiment
in the Senior class which sounds
the death note of the spirit of '95
and the pioneers. It is a protest
against a listlessness which endures
submission to false and anemic
academic ideals without seeking a
vigorous and healthy originality.
It is a protest against quashing a
Stanford custom and tradition
which has proved as much right to
existence as any custom which
makes the University distinctively
what it is.
Specifically, it is a protest against
the action of the Senior Farce com
mittee in choosing Gilbert and Sul
livan's opera "Patience" to pro
duce in Senior Week, and the ac
tion of the class in sustaining its
committee when the matter came
to a test. The first action was
astonishing, and not to be lightly
considered; the second action is de
plorable, and not to be lightly con
doned. Many people, especially
among former Stanford men, be
lieve these measures to be drastic
ally and essentially wrong,eminent
ly prejudicial to the best interests
of the student body and to the Uni
versity at large.
In fairness to the committee and
class which have chosen to match
precedent with prejudice, they
should have reasons for the objec
tion here raised. Such objections
may have been pretty well threshed
over in the columns of the Daily
Palo Alto, but repetition will do
no harm in a cause of this kind.
"Patience" is worth seeing if
well done. Amateurs in such a
performance can not hope for more
than a limited, relative success;but
it is laughable and contains some
good music. Yet it has no remote
touch of college atmosphere or col
lege life. There is no reason for its
production upon a Stanford stage.
Other plays than those written
by students have been seen in
Assembly Hall, but never in Senior
Week and never without justifica
tion. "Antigone" and"The Knight
of the Burning Pestle" found their
justification in subject, historic
interest, and the fact that they were
produced before a University audi
ence. The "Pirates of Penzance"
does not in any way enter this dis
cussion, as it was not staged with
the official stamp of a class, was
not acted by students, and was not
intended to establish a prece
dent. "David Garrick" was a new
venture and, I have no doubt, suc
cessful, but it could not have been
sufficiently so to abolish in a single
glittering triumph a well-establish
ed college custom handed down to
the recent generation, of which I
made one, by some of the most able
and loyal men that Stanford ever
produced.
Follow out the committee's argu
ment for a moment. When from
various reports the student body
has come to believe that debating
material is weak at the University,
is open competition refused and are
the men sent haphazard to meet
their California antagonists with a
recitation of the "Declaration of
Independence"? When football
prospects promise little, does prac
tice cease and are the brawny ath
letes speeded with cheers to the
Richmond field to try conclusions
with the Blue and Gold at the hon
orable and time-honored game of
■"Puss-in-the-corner"? When the

best the preparatory schools have
to offer teems poor, does the Uni
versity close its gates never to open
them again?
It is a pitiable and unworthy
confession to suggest that origi
nality, creative ability, the one
element in which Stanford — the
old Stanford — gloried and grew
glorious, is dead at the Univer
sity. It is a weak and feminine
plaint to cry that some of the
Senior Farces in theirlustiness and
exuberance have been coarse or
crude. Waiving the point, which
is open to vigorous discussion, they
were college farces and Stanford
farces, full of the sunlight which
glows upon the quad, full of the
frolic of the life we love.
How shall originality prove it
self if it is given no chance? Other
men in other days had theirchance
and proved it. What is this sud
den somnolence that has descended
upon the ranks of the Stanford
men? The class has described the
absurd circle that because there
seems to be rio originality there
shall be no farce, and because there
shall be no farce there can be no
originality.
if the plaint of lack of originality
really rang true, then there are
many recourses which do not ex
tend to the prehistoric period of
"Patience." Many good farces
have been written for Stanford.
C. K. Field, both the Irwins,
Bradley and Erb, and Bowman and
Adams all wrote rattling good far
ces, now all but forgotten. A little
touching up of one of these would
put "Patience" under and not upon
a lasting monument, even then,
perhaps,smiling at the unwarranted
grief of the committee. Further
more, there are plenty of Stanford
graduates of farce experience who
stand ready at the call of assistance.
Finally, to pass by many im
portant considerations, such as the
ethical and national value of col
lege farce-writing, the Senior class
has, ignorantly ( or carelessly, vio
lated a tradition about which some
of the brightest hopes and memor
ies of the college centered. The
committee can not hide behind the
class nor can the class hide behind
the committee. A grievous blow
has been struck at the roots of a
tradition which from year to year
since the beginning has tlowered
beautifully and bountifully with
little variation.
You can not train a custom by
killing it any more than you can
train a child in the name manner.
College customs are the children of
former college spirit. The custom
of producing an original and dis
tinctive farce during Senior Week
came of worthy parents and, until
this year's committee rendered its
dictum, was always considered a
welcome and worthy child.
The Senior Farce is not alone
for the Senior class nor for the stu
dent body, but for generations gone
and generations to come. To them
some accounting is due, if only in
the way of listening to communi
cations such as this, which the com
mittee has expressed itself as averse
to hearing or heeding.
If there be any who love Stan
ford in all the ways that love can
be tendered, let the Senior Farce be
