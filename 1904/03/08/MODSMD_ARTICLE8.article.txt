# VARSITY WILL PLAY PRESIDIO.
## Team Composed of Army Officers Is Scheduled for Thursday Afternoon. 
### 
The University baseball nine
will play its next game Thursday
afternoon. The opposing team will
come* from the Presidio at San
Francisco, and will be composed
entirely of commissioned officers in
the United States Army. Some of
these men have represented West
Point on the diamond, and all of
them are reputed to be players of
no little merit. Continuous prac
tice at the Presidio has given them
opportunity to develop good team
work. While they probably will
not be able to defeat their younger
college opponents, they will at
least play a close game with the
Varsity. The team is not the one
composed of private soldiers sched
uled to meet the Varsity some time
ago.
The personnel of the Stanford
nine for Thursday's game has not
been definitely settled. All three
candidates for pitcher will probably
be given a chance, and Captain
Ball will catch. Colbert, '00, has
returned to college and will again
enter the competition for first base,
which makes the final result of
that struggle extremely uncertain.
Williams will play second base;
Trowbridge, short-stop; Swain,
third base. In the field the same
men will play who have been given
a chance during the past week.
The game will be called at 3:30.
