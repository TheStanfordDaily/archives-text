# FOUNDER'S DAY EXERCISES.
## Colonel John P. Irish Delivers an Address in Assembly Hall. 
### 
The exercises in Assembly Hall
last night in commemoration of the
birth of the late Senator Stanford
drew an attendance of about 1000
persons, many of whom were visi
tors. The stage was very prettily
decorated with ferns, flowers
and potted plants. Colonel John
P. Irish, Naval Customs Officer of
San Francisco, who was the speaker
of the evening, was introduced by
President Jordan and was given a
warm reception. He began by pay
ing a tribute to the character of
Senator Stanford, of whom he said
he was a close friend.
"I hold precious' in my memory,"
he said, ''my long acquaintance
with the founder of this University.
I recall with pleasure his exceeding
greatness of character and devotion
to the welfare of his fellow men. The
greatness of his optimism, his con
fidence in the future, were such
that where other men balked, he
went forward, and no opposition
or misrepresentation ever deterred
him in his march to the goal he
had set for himself. He was an
example for all the young men of
this country.
"This institution was devised
and founded to teach that simple
truth, which is the need of all cen
turies, that a straight line is the
shortest line between two points.
When men conclude that a crooked
line is shortest they fade away and
perish; the others survive in honor.
You of this young generation are
coming t<> face the problems of the
future. I hope you will face them
in the spirit of the founder of this
University. You have not an easy
time before you if you intend to
take an active part in the affairs
of life. There will be problems for
your solution that will be quite as
difficult as any of the problems of
the generations that have preceded
you.
"The actual foundation and
formation of your character has
been made before you reach this
University. You came here inde
pendent, self-willed, self-centered.
These foundations of character are
to be found in the public school
system of this country. The better
application of this foundation is
found in the higher schools and
colleges of this country. It is said
that the perpetuity of the state
today depends on the independence
and character of the people. If
this is true, the state alone is justi
fied in taking charge of the primary
and intermediate education of its
people. This is one of the great
problems that you must solve. The
solution of that problem is to de
pend on those among us who, born
philosophers, know that a straight
line is the shortest distance between
two points, and on those who have
been trained to the same knowledge
in institutions like this.
"This institution has taught in
a large degree independence, self
will, ready wit, and that use of
initiative which gives the com
mand of others. This University
confirms in you that element of
patriotism which is a great part of

the American character. Your
country will never be so strong that
it will not need the spirit and con
viction of patriotism. The de
mands on your patriotism in times
of peace are liable to be as great
as in times of war. Many things
call for Ihe exercise of moral cour
age rather than physical courage."

announced to sing, was not on

no music.
