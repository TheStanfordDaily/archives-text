Tickets for the lecture of Homer
Davenport on "The Power of a
Cartoon" in Assembly Hall next
Monday evening were placed on
sale at the Bookstore and at the
Stanford Pharmacy in Palo Alto
this afternoon. The prices are
75 cents and 50 cents. Daven
port's lecture will be more in the
nature of a series of humorous
talks than an address. Davenport
is a slendid story-teller, and his
lecture is made up of a selection of
storiettes, adventures, anecdotes,
and experiences of all kinds. There
is not a moment during his dis
course, that is not full of absorb
ing interest. He tells his stories,
crayon in hand, and illustrates
them with rapid cartoon drawings.
Nothing more concise has ever been
said of him than the remark of ex-
Governor Taylor: "Davenport is a
volume of wit and humor, and each
cartoon tells an eloquent story."
Although the trend of his lecture
is of a humorous vein, some of his
stories have their pathetic side, —
the story of the "Widowed Duck"
for instance; but witty or pathetic,
they are told as only Davenport,
with his magnetic personality, can
tell them, and illustrated with
drawings that papers have paid
him fabulous sums to obtain. From
a never-do-well in the little West
ern town of Silverton, he has in a
few years risen to the pinnacle of
success, and is sought after at the
present moment by half the news
papers in New York, offering the
highest salary ever paid to a car
toonist. Hut before going into news
paper illustrating again, Daven
port wishes to come to this Coast —
getting fresh ideas, and recuperat
ing after a long spell of hard work.
