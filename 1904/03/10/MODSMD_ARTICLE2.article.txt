# Completion of Outer Quadrangle.
## 
### 
With the exception of a single
keystone in one arch of the arcade
connecting the Mining and Civil
Engineering buildings, the stone
work of the outer quadrangle is
now completed. The incomplete
arch adjoins the Civil Engineering
building, and is on the outer side
of the arcade.
In connection with the placing
of this final stone to complete
work that has extended over five
years, it has been suggested that
some simple ceremony be held and
that the ceremony be conducted by
members of the class of 1904, in as
much as the present Seniors have
seen the newer and larger Stanford
grow during their four years in the
University. Treasurer Charles G.
Lathrop has given hisconsentin the
matter, and it is expected that the
other University authorities and
Contractor J. D. McGilvray will
concur in the plan. Tomorrow a
temporary committee of Seniors
will probably be appointed by
Class-President E. G. Brua to take
charge of arrangements.
