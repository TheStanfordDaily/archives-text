# Damage by Storm.
## 
### 
The severe wind and rain storm
which raged last night and today
caused considerable damage to
campus property. At the Univer
sity Library a window was blown
in, and the roof leaked in several
places, causing the plaster in one
of the seminar-rooms to drop.
The baseball back-stop was blown
over, as was also one of the tennis
back-stops. Several of the houses
on the campus were slightly dam
aged, and in one or two cases
chimneys were blown over. The
wind blew down telephone and
power lines in several places, and
as a result most of the campus was
in darkness after eleven last night,
and communication by telephone
was interrupted. Several trees
were uprooted by the force of the
wind.
