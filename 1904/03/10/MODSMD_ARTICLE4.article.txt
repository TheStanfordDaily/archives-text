## 
### 
A contest has been arranged be
tween the Stanford Chess Club and
the Palo Ajto Chess Club for to
morrow evening. The matches will
be played at the home of Dr.
Scroggs in Palo Alto. The men
who will represent the club from
the University have not been de
finitely selected,, but they will
probably include those who have
played in the intercollegiate con
tests of former years, and one or
two other players. This contest is
in the nature of a preliminary try
out for the chess team this year,
though the team will really be
chosen from the winners of the
round robin tournament which is
being played among the members
of the club.
