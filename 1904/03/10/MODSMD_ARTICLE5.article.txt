# PLAY TIE GAME.
## Alumni and Varsity Each Score One Run in an Eleven-Inning Contest. 
### 
The Varsity and Alumni played
eleven innings of close baseball on
Tuesday. The final score was 1 to
1. The playing was slow through
out, and the game dragged during
the last innings, until darkness
finally prevented the teams from
playing longer.
Sales and Lanagan were both in
fine form, and after the first four
innings the game became a pitch
ers' battle. Sales and Lanagan
each struck out ten men; the
former allowed six hits and gave
three baseß on balls, while the
latter gave one base on balls but
allowed nine hits. Sales was
steady at critical moments, how
ever, and in the third and fourth
innings, although the Alumni filled
the bases, he struck out the men at
bat and prevented a run from being
scored.
The Alumni were the first to
score, McGilvray crossing the plate
in the second inning on a passed
ball by the Varsity catcher. The
Varsity's tally came in the fourth
inning. Sales reached second on a
hit and an error, and scored on
Doyle's wild throw of Wirt's
grounder. Neither side came near
scoring after the fourth inning
until McGilvray, in the tenth,
reached third for the Alumni, but
failed to reach home.
Colbert was tried at first base
and played the position in good
form. Reid, the former Harvard
catcher and captain, was the star
of the Alumni team, hitting well
and throwing to bases with great
speed and accuracy.
This is the second tie game of
eleven innings that the Varsity has
played this season. The first tie
was with Santa Clara, the score be
ing 4 to 4.
