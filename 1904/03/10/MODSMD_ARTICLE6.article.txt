# Chamber Concert Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The sale of seats for tbe third
Chamber Concert gives promise of
a good house tomorrow evening.
The Kopta Quartet, which will
furnish the instrumental music of
the program, needs no introduction,
as it has appeared at Stanford
twice this year in similar concerts.
Mrs. Blanchard, the vocal soloist,
comes well recommended, and the
program which she has selected
contains a number of pleasing
songs, among them Schubert's
"Who is Silvia?", McDowell's "Thy
Beaming Eyes," and Foote's "In
Picardie." The string music will
be principally quartets from
Godard, Beethoven, and Tschai
kowsky. Tbe full program was
printed in the Daily Palo Alto
Tuesday evening.
