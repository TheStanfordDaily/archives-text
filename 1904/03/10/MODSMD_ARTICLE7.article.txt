# Promenade Concert a Success.
## 
### 
The first of the series of Prome
nade Concerts given by the Uni
versity Hand on the quad, last
Tuesday evening, proved a most
successful affair. Unfavorable
weather shortened the musical pro
gram and tended to lessen the
attendance, but notwithstanding
this circumstance the innovation
is one that warrants a continuance.
The program was well executed.
Among the most satisf ctory num
bers were the fantasia, ''Tone Pic
tures of the North and South"; the
waltz, "Daughter of Love"; and the
intermezzo, "A Fairy Tale."
The next concert will occur
shortly after the mid-semester
recess, but the date has not been
definitely set. There will probably
be three more concerts this semes
ter.
