In a recent editorial in the Daily
Californian a plea was voiced that
Homer Davenport might he cecured
to give a talk at the State Univer
sity. Stanford is singularly for
tunate in that she has secured this
famous cartoonist to give one of his
inimitable illustrated addresses.
The attention of the student body
is called to the talk that Davenport
will give in Assembly Hall next
Monday night. As a narrator of
storien, with a deep insight into
human nature, his reputation is
second only to his fame as a n artist.
It is to he hoped that he will be
welcomed here in the same enthus
iastic way that he has been re
ceived at other places throughout
the country.
