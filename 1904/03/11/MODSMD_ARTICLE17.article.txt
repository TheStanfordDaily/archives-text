The next number of the Chapar
ral, which will he on sale Monday,
will contain a new assortment of
spring jokes.
The verse is less in quantity than
usual, while long prose sketches
predominate. "A llondel," the
leading verse feature, is especially
good. Editorially a very decided
stand is taken against the spirit
which decries the class farce, and
comment i* made on the major
professor system in the University.
The art features are two panel* hy
Borough, '04, a sketch hy Miss
Mary Well man, and a number of
drawings by L. M. Bowman, '01.
