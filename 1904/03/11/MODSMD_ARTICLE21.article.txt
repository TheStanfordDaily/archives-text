# Lieutenant Carden Lectures.

Lieutenant Godfrey L. Carden
gave a must interesting discourse
in the chapel last night on the
industrial display at the World's
Fair at St. Louis and a discussion
of the iron and steel plants in
Europe, particularly in Germany.
The lecture was illustrated through
out by stereopticon views.
Concerning the Exposition, Lieu
tenant Carden gave statistics to
show that it is by far the largest
undertaking of the kind that has
ever been attempted. In space
used the Louisana Purchase Expo
sition will extend over 1240 acres,
as compared to 636 acres at the
Chicago Exposition, while the
buildings will cover 128 acres as
compared to 82 acres. Over fifty
foreign countries have appropriated
large amounts for exhibits, and the
total amount of money now avail
able is $35,000,000, or about $10,-
000,000 more than was obtained
for the Chicago Exposition. Lieu
tenant Carden gave many views of
buildings and sites as they appear
now in course of construction.
Machinery Hall, with which he is
directly connected, will contain the
power plant for the entire Exposi
tion. The total amount required
will be 53,000 horsepower, as
against 12,000 horsepower used at
Chicago.
Turning to his recent trip
through Europe, and the results of
his investigations, Lieutenant Car
den said that in all he visited 1200
iron and steel plants, 350 of which
were in Germany. He gave a num
ber of instances illustrating the
readiness of the Germans to pick
up information and improved
methods, and to profit in their
application. In this connection'
are to be found a great many
American tools and appliances.
In the matter of shop practice
and economy of labor and of time
the Americans are far in the lead.
Pictures were given illustrating the
difference between the methods of
the two countries. While the
Americans are supreme in economy
and dispatch of production, never
theless the Germans are driving
them out of some of the best mar
kets of the world by the superior
quality of their products. This is
practically true of locomotives and
gas engines, in which lines America
is rapidly losing ground through
her carelessness in regard to the
quality of her output.
.Scenes were given of the immense
industrial plants of Germany,
France, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden,
and England, ranging from the
water-power plants in the Alps to
the immense-Krupp plant with its
80,000 employes. Lieutenant Car

den gave an interesting outline of
the methods used by the various
great manufacturers in the man
agement of their employes and
the economic results of the various
experiments that are being tried in
different parts of the world.
