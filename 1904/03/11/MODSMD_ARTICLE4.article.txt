# SANTA CLARA TOMORROW.
## Varsity Will Play Last Game of the Series on the Campus Diamond. 
### 
The Varsity will meet Santa
Clara on the campus at 3 tomor
row in the fifth and last game of
their series. Santa Clara has won
two, Stanford one, and one was
a tie. Should Stanford win tomor
row there is a probability that a
deciding game will be played, as
each team would then have two
victories to its credit.
Santa Clara defeated the Varsity
by the score of 11 to 0 in the last
game. (/base, the left-banded
pitcher who was then in the box,
will probably pitch tomorrow.
Should he plav his regular position
at second base, Wallman, who
played in the first and third games
of the series, will do the pitch
ing.
The personnel of the Varsity will
be similar to that of the team
which played on Tuesday. Tritch
will do the pitching and Sales will
be in left field, the remainder of the
players being unchanged. Colbert
will be on first base again, and
should he continue playing the
game he showed himself capable of
earlier in the season he will proba
bly occupy this position when the
team faces California. Sales has
shown himself to be one of the
heaviest hitters on the team, and
is a valuable man for the outfield
when he is not being used in the
box.
Santa Clara will meet California
on the campus a week from tomor
row, and a good comparison can
then be obtained of the Varsity
teams.
The two teams for tomorrow's
game will be as follows:
Stanford—Ball, catcher; Tritch,
pitcher; Colbert, first base; \\ il
liams, second base; Swain, third
base; Trowbridge, short-stop ;
Sales, left field; Wirt, center field;
Knight, right (ield.
Santa Clara —McKune, catcher;
Chase or Wallman, pitcher;
first base; Chase or Russell, second
base; Griffin, third base: Farry,
short-stop; Budde, left field; Clyne,
center field; Durfee, right field.
