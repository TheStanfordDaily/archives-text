# DAVENPORT WILL SPEAK.
## San Francisco Paper Tells of Ability of Man Who Will Appear Monday Night. 
### 
Homer Davenport, the famous
cartoonist, who is to talk on "The
Power of a Cartoon'' in Assembly
Hall on Monday evening, March
14th, addressed an audience in Ly
ric Hall, in San Francisco, last
evening. In its report of the talk
the San Francisco Chronicle says:
" The lecture was a succession of
stories told with whimsical dryness,
redolentof human nature and illus
trated in an offhand and apolo
getic way by sketches on an easel
board. The cartoonist told of Sen
ator Hanna, of Sam Rainey, of Ad
mind Dewey, of Gladstone and of
Thomas R. lieedâ€”to each character
and caricature attached a good
story.
"Mr. Davenport indulged in slv
Hings at his own art, half patheti
cally deprecated his own attacks,
'vicious attacks' he called them, on
many noted men. Every now and
then he was drawn quite away from
the subject of cartoons and told
what were simply good anecdotes,
relating them in an even, vibrant
voice, which carried the point of
the joke to the farthest corners of
the hall. One of the most taking
of these was a tale of a gray duck
'whose little black eves shone like
shoe buttons with affection.'
"Throughout the talk Mr. Da
venport kept up the personal refer
ence, giving many hints as to his
own career and his relations with
well-known men. This was especi
ally engaging in the story he told
about Admiral Dewey's troubles
over the house presented him in
Washington, a story which brought
the tears to many eyes last night. 1 '
Julia Hawthorne, the well-known
novelist, in writing of Davenport,
says:
"1 was with him once on a two
weeks' trip, when he spoke every
day. While he was speaking,
nothing could have drawn me away
from the sound of his voice. All
he said was as fascinating and win
ning in the manner of it as it was
racy, wholesome and original in its
ma iter. His look and figure are
engaging; his eyes full of humor,
honesty and magnetism; his voice
clear, flexible and melodious. There
is not, to my knowledge, any other
man now in this country who can
successfully rival him in the natur
al gifts which make up a man to
whom audiences love to listen; nor
is there another who has matter to
present to an audience which will
better charm and repay their at
ten I ion.
"He is unique. Were t here others
like him, the lyceum stage would
be today an institution as popular
as it was a generation ago. Add
to this the fact that his achieve
ments as a cartoonist have made his
name famous all over the world,
and it is plain that you have in
Homer Davenport a spell to con
jure with to good purpose. He is
irresistible."
