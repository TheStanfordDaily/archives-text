## Track Team Will Contest with Neither Nevada nor Santa Rosa High School. 
### 
The track meet between the
Varsity and the University of
Nevada, scheduled to take place on
March 19th, has been cancelled.
Treasurer Cowden received a letter
from Manager Catlin of the Nevada
team in which stipulations not in
the original agreement were made
and to which the Stanford manager
found it impossible to agree. Word
to that effect was sent to Nevada.
Owing to had weather the Nevada
team could not he chosen until
after the lGth, and the Nevada
manager could not assure a meet
with Stanford until after that date.
In spite of this fact he wished a
guarantee of $180 and the hotel
expenses of fourteen men, an ex
pense which the Stanford manage
ment did not feel justified in guar
anteeing upon so short a notice,
since the time left for advertising
would have heen very brief.
The meet between the Fresh
man team and the Santa liosa
high school, which was scheduled
for tomorrow morning, has been
called off on account of the bad
condition of the track. The heavy
rain of Wednesday night left the
track in worse shape than it "has
been this year. A large part of ihe
cinders has been washed away and
the poor clay foundation is all that
remains. Only a portion of the
cinder-path can be used by the
men who are training daily, and
even that is very soft. It will be
necessary to re-cover a large part
of the track with cinders. The
oval also is in bad condition, so
that the junipers and others pre
paring for the field events are handi
capped.
