# Chamber Concert on Friday Night.
## 
### 
The third chamber concert given
in Assembly Hall last Friday night
was no less successful than those
given earlier in the season. All
the numbers were well received,
and the quartets of Beethoven and
Tschaikowsky as rendered by the
Kopta Quartet deserve especial
mention. Mrs. Hlanchard, who
appeared here for the first time as
soloist, has a full and pleasant
voice, and her efforts were thor
oughly appreciated by the aud
ience.
