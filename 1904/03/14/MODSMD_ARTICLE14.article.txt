There is reason for congratula
tion in the action of the California
dramatic society in bringing its
play, "The Jealous Wife," to the
Stanford campus. Situated as we
are, Stanford must ever be the rival
of California in every line of inter
collegiate activity, but there is no
reason that this rivalry should pre
vent an exchange of friendly cour
tesies between the two great colleges
of this State. There is no particu
lar significance to the visit of "The
Jealous Wife," and probably
neither the Mask and Dagger of
California nor the Sword and San
dals of Stanford looked deep into
its motives when the offer to bring
the play to Stanford was made and
accepted. But the move is a laud
atory one, and there is reason for
pleasure in that a California or
ganization would think of visiting
us and we would meet the offer in
the spirit in which it was made.
There will be less of meanness and
more of the spirit of true sport be
tween us when the men of both
colleges confine their rivalry to the
diamond or the football field and
are willing to meet on a fair basis
on other occasions.
