Rev. E. E. Baker of the First
Presbyterian Church of Oakland
preached at the morning service in
Memorial Church Sunday. He
took for his text Galatians vi, 2,
"Bear ye one another's burdens
and so fulfill the law of Christ."
Dr. Baker said that all humanity
is divided into three classes, â€”pes-
simists, optimists and mediaists.
The pessimist looks always on the
dark side of life. He may have his
place in society, but his mood is
most uninviting. Optimism, on
the other hand, is reasonable and
liveable. It advocates submission
to the inevitable, accepting a thing
as for the best even though the rea
sons for it may not be easily dis
cernible.
It is our social relationships that
govern our lives. Environment is
the main feature in our social
status. The first circle of environ
ment is the family as a social unit.
Anything imperiling the home is a
danger we must oppose and stop.
In this connection Dr. Baker advo
cated strongly a national divorce
law. Larger circles in the social
status are the village, the city and
the country. In these, people sur
render their individual interests
for the one great organic whole.
The call of citizenship is a social
call. No man is truly social who
does not perform his duty toward
the state.
But the widest circle of environ
ment is divinity, the marvelous
possibility that the individual may
find himself expressed in terms of
fellowship with God, the maker.
In this the new command for social
law is "Love one another." The
highest claims one may have on
another is expressed in terms of
love. The law of the savages is
"Live one on another," the lowest
possible relationship. Semi-bar
barism terms its social relation,
"Liee whether others live or not,"
exemplified in men who saveahem
selves in times of peril regardless
of others. Present civilization
comes to the standard of "To live
and to let live," but has not yet
equalled the command to love
one another. The golden rule is
not adequate because it may be
twisted to suit occasions. It is not
the highest nor the finest of Chris
tianity; it is merely Christ's sum
mary of the best in Judaism. The

man who practices the golden rule
is not a christian; he must obey
the new command to love one
another, to love everybody. The
man who obeys the golden rule
may hate the man whom he is wil
ling to have hate him. The law
of love finds expression in sacrifice,
sympathy, and service, especially
in the latter. We do not need men
who are willing to be burned as
martyrs, but men who are willing
to serve.
