## 
### 
The track meet between the
Freshman team and the Santa
Rosa High School, which was
scheduled for last Saturday but
was postponed because of the rain,
will he held next Saturday, weather
permitting. The storm of last
week left the track in very poor
condition, a large part of the cinders
having been washed away. The
moderate weather since, however,
has allowed the soil to dry some
what and the damage is now being
repaired. Unless the present rain
becomes heavy and continuous, the
track will be in fair condition for
the meet on Saturday.
