The baseball game between the
Alumni and the Varsity played on
Tuesday afternoon netted $70.75
for the benefit of the women's ten
nis court. The additional sum of
$40 has been turned over by those
members of Encina Club who
walked to the last Encina "at
home" instead of hiring carriages.
The total sum thus obtained is
more than sufficient to pay for the
construction of the desired court,
and Treasurer Cowden has an
nounced that two courts can be
built if the girls will raise another
$40.
