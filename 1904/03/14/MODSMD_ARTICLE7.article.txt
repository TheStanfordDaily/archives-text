# VARSITY DEFEATED.
## Santa Clara Wins Last Game of the Series in Ten-Inning Contest on Campus Diamond. 
### 
After ten close innings Santa
Clara defeated the Varsity in the
last game of the series on Saturday
afternoon by the score of 4 to 8.
The game was close and exciting,
the result being in doubt until the
last man had been put out. Both
teams played good ball, hut Santa
Clara was fortunate in obtaining her
hits when they counted most.
The Varsity was in the lead at
the beginning of the ninth inning,
the score standing 3 to 2. With
two men out Durfee was given a
base on balls and scored on Budde's
three-base hit to left field. This
tied the score and Stanford failed
to score in her turn at the bat.
Santa Clara scored what proved to
be the winning run in the first
of the tenth, Farry reaching home]
on a long hit by Chase to left field.
Stanford was unable to tie the score.
Chase pitched again for Santa
Clara, but did not prove as effec
tive as in the two former games.
His team mates ran the bases with
their usual speed and skill, while
the Stanford players were weak in
this feature of the game.
The victory on Saturday is the
third time Santa Clara has beaten
the Varsity this season. Of the
two other games played one was a
tie and the other a victory for
Stanford.
The next game will take place
on the campus on Thursday after
noon when the Varsity will meet a
team composed of officers from the
Presidio. Tritch will probably
pitch again, as Sales is suffering
from a wrenched knee and will be
out of the game for at least a week.
