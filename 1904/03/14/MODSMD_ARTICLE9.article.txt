The informal chess tournament
held last Friday evening between
the Stanford Chess Club and the
Palo Alto Chess Club, was won by
the latter by the score of two
matches to one. On account of the
rain only a small number of play
ers were present and consequently
only three matches were played.
The results of these games were as
follows : E. W. Doane, gr, lost to
Dr. Walker; A. T. Parsons, '04,
lost to H. \V. Simkins; and F. E.
U1 rich, Law sp., won from Dr.
Scroggs. The tournament was
played at the home of Dr. Scroggs
in Palo Alto.
