The track meet on Saturday
morning between the Freshmen
and the Santa Rosa High School
promises to be a very interesting
contest. It is evident from infor
mation that Captain Holman has
received concerning the different
men of the Santa Rosa team that
the first-year men will have to do
their best to win the day. Some of
the visiting contestants are among
the best men of the Academic Ath
letic League. Rathbone, the cap
tain, can do better than 0.54 in the
440-yard dash on a good track.
Hitchcock can run the 100 in
0:10.4, and he also has a record of
10 feet 4 inches in the pole-vault
in the Academic League. Schaupp
is good for 2:15 in the half-mile
run, and has thrown the 12-pound
hammer 135 feet. Smith will run
in the mile and 2-mile events. He
lias a record of 4:50 in the mile.
Page is the best jumper of the team.
In the high jump he has made 5
feet 6 inches, and in the broad
jump 20 feet. Youker can throw
the 12-pound hammer 130 feet, and

close, will be one mile, six men
running for each side, according to
the rule of the Academic Athletic
League. Besides this regular relay
race as a part of the Freshman-

relay run by track men from the
other three classes of the Univer
sity. This event will be putin as
a special feature in -the middle of

ning relays.
