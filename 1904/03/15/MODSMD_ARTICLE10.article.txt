The Alumnus in its columns
recently called atteotion to the
necessity for creating at Stanford a
permanent class secretary to keep
lasting records of the members
of the class and keep the alumni
in closer touch with the University.
To the Senior class of 1904 an op
portunity is offered to inaugurate
what will prove to be not only an
admirable but an absolutely neces
sary custom. The Alumnus treats
the question editorially as follows:
The best means for keeping in
touch with every graduate, and
every graduate retaining his inter
est in the University, lies in the
election by each senior class of a
permanent secretary who shall be
entrusted with the duty of keeping
accurate records of every member
of the class. He should be elected
for life, as at Yale, and the office
will become such an honorary one
as to make it much coveted. A
permanent fund can be set aside at
graduation time to be used by the
secretary in corresponding with the
class, and this fund could be de
posited and draw interest. It will
be absolutely necessary that the
person chosen be the most efficient
in his class for the purpose, and
above all he must be one who is to
maintain a permanent residence in
the vicinity of Stanford. He must
be a hard worker, for in him will
rest the task of getting the address
of every member of his class each
year and keeping complete bio
graphical records. By and by,
when the custom of class reunions
is inaugurated, the secretary will be
able to gather together a large rep
resentation of his class. The one
chosen must be a good statisician
and a business man, for he will
have to compile records showing
what his Stanford classmates are
doing in the world of affairs. Such
records will show what the Univer
sity is accomplishing through her
sons and daughters. The present
Seniorclass hasit in its hand to start
a custom that sooner or later must
become a fixture at Stanford. Some
class is going to begin by setting
aside a fund of $150 or $250 to

cover the expenses of correspond
ence and printing, and the class
of 15)04 will bring itself inestimable
satisfaction and glory by the privi
lege of initiation.
