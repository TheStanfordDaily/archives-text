# Discusses College Courses.

### 
An intelligent discussion by
Mason Trowbridge in the last
number of the Yale Alumni Weakly
brings forward the displacement of
the college curriculum as the im
portant feature in college life, and
the encroachment upon it by stu
dent activities. The writer points
out the fact that the elective sys
tem, together with a relaxation on
the part of instructors, has made
the curriculum more easy to cover
than it was several years ago. The
result has heen the turning of
energy and attention by the stu
dents toward all sorts of student
body affairs and student organiza
tions. The great value to be de
rived from association with fellow
students and thorough interest in
student activities is not overlooked
by Mr. Trowbridge, who states that
he believes that these features are
the greatest things to be gained
from a four years course. But, at
the same time, he deplores the fact
that students use this to excuse
their neglect of the curriculum,
and that a large number of stu
dents become too strongly imbued
with the idea that they can absorb
general culture by mere effortless
residence in a college community.
There is a tendency toward dis
proportionately regarding athletic
contests and the other activities as
compared with the curriculum,
which ought naturally to be the
main purpose of college.
The remedy suggested for the
growing evil is not alone found by
Mr. Trowbridge in more stringent
requirements by the faculty. He
believes that curriculum restrictions
will be made more strict, but he
offers as the most weighty influence
of readjustment the general atti
tude of the alumni toward the rela
tive importance of the curriculum
and student activity.
