# Conditions on Baseball Field.

### 
The Varsity baseball team is now
taking definite shape and is rapidly
rounding into form for the contest
with California in April. When

the season started there were five of
tlie 1903 Varsity who entered the
contest for this season's team. New
men have been developed to fill the
vacant positions, and a team has
heen made that should give a good
account of itself in the intercollegi
ate series. The principal change
on the team was the shifting of the
infield players early in the season.
Williams was moved from short
stop, where he played last year, to
second base; Swain, the Freshman
captain, from second base to third;
and Trowbridge from third to short
stop. This change has been pro
ductive of general benefit, as these
men fill their new positions much
better than they played in their
former places.
The struggle for first base, which
has been fierce throughout the sea
son, is now considerably narrowed
down. Moore, Blake, Matthews
and Stott have all seemed likely
candidates for this position at dif
ferent times, but Colbert at present
appears to be the man who will
play at first in the intercollegiate
series. For the pitcher's position
Sales and Tritch are both strong
candidates, but it is probable that
Tritch will pitch the first game
against California. Sales, however,
has practically won a place for
himself on the team by his heavy
hitting during the season.
In the outfield, with the excep
tion of Wirt in center, the positions
are still unsettled. Chalmers,
Knight, Blake, Matthews and Sales
are men who may fill these posi
tions, the men who prove most ef
tive at the bat being the most like
ly to win out. Ball has caught for
the team throughout the season,
and has played his position well.
The men have improved very
perceptibly in team work, and as a
whole have improved in batting.
One weak feature that still needs
to be corrected is the poor base-run
ning. To this weakness the loss of
several games can be attributed.
The Varsity has shown an inability
at different times during the season
to play a good up-hill game, or to
score when a run was most needed;
but there is every prospect that
these faults may be eradicated be
fore the end of the season.
