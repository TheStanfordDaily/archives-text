# DAVENPORT IS ENTERTAINING.
## Famous Cartoonist Delivers Interesting Talk Before Large Audience in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Homer Davenport, the famous
cartoonist, entertained over four
hundred people in Assembly Hall
last night. His talk on "The
Power of a Cartoon" never failed
for an instant to keep the closest
attention of the audience, which
was either in laughter at his
humorous narrations, or in perfect
quietude when he told stories
colored with pathos. His cartoons
on subjects varying from sketches
of wild birds to the likenesses of
statesmen, appeared at intervals
just far enough apart to appeal
most effectively to the audience.
Davenport opened his talk by re
lating several incidents of his early
boyhood at Silverton, Oregon, and
then recounted with much pure
humor his trip from Silverton to
San Francisco where he began his
career as a cartoonist on the San
Francisco Chronicle. From this
point the speaker went directly to
his subject "The Power of a Car
toon." He spoke of the late Sen
ator Hanna, and in commenting
upon the political power of that
man said that he was one great
enough to withstand the powerful
influence of the cartoon. Daven
port's first sketch was of Senator
Hanna and was drawn, he said, not
to provoke a laugh but to show the
greatness of the original, who had
lived down all attacks of cartoon
ists and sensationalists.
The speaker then changed the
tone of his lecture and told a
pathetic story of a wild goose which
he had raised and of which he had
made a friend in his early days at
Silverton. At the conclusion of
this story a few strokes of the
artist's crayon put a likeness of his
wild friend before the audience.
Mr. Davenport again turned to the
political field and told in an ex
tremely entertaining mariher of
many humorous occurrences that
had happened to him as a result
of his cartoons of famous politi
cians of the United Stales. The
narration of his interview with
Gladstone was especially amusing,
and his cartoons of Gladstone and
of Senator Spooner of Wisconsin
received much applause from the
audience.
Admiral Dewey was the next
famous personage to appear under
the pencil of Davenport, and the
explanation of the origin and re
sults of Davenport's famous car
toon "Lest We Forget" held the
undivided attention of the audi
ence.
A fairly exact cartoon of Mr.
George Adderson,overseer of build
ings of the University, brought
forth continued applause for its
accuracy and its local character.
One or two stories of Indian life
were told and were very ingeniously
applied to demonstrating the power
of a cartoon.
The lecture closed with a
thoroughly sympathetic story of a
pair of wild ducks which are num
bered among the large number of
pets kept by Davenport at his
home. This stor}' was very sig
nificant in showing Davenport's

great love for nature and his kind
ness and sympathy for wild ani
mals.
After the talk the speaker was
entertained by the members of the
Stanford Press Club, under whose
auspices the lecture was given.
