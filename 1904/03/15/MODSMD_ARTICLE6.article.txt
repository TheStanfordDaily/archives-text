In order to make more space for
the new collections now en route
from India, the Hopkins' Corean
Collection lias been moved from its
former position in room 1 to room
N. This fills the only room in the
completed portion of the building
which had remained unoccupied.
Of the mosaics to be placed in
the front gables the first is nearly
completed, it consists of four life
sized figures emblematic of fame
crowning the arts. The other will

The ears, hoofs, mane, and tail
of Beautiful Hells, which died re
cently at the Stock Farm, will be
placed in the Stock Farm exhibit
along with those of Electioneer,
Palo Alto, and other famous Stan
ford horses. Beautiful Bells was
the most famous brood mare that
the world has produced. She was
the dam of eighteen colts, all fa
mous trotters. Several world's re
cords were made by her projeny, one
of which, Bell Boy, was sold for $50,-
000, while others also brought high
prices.
Curator Peterson has received a
letter from Congressman W. A.
Rodenberg enclosing a copy of a
hill which has been introduced by
him in the House of Representa
tives. The bill is of great impor
tance to all museums and to the
public at large, in that it provides
for the preservation of all archae
ological matter now on the various
government reservations and pub
lic domain. Everything is placed
under the direct supervision of the
Secretary of the Interior, and ex
cavations can be made only by
museums and universities. The
bill provides that conterfeiting
American antiquities shall be a
misdemeanor punishable by a
heavy fine and imprisonment. â€¢
