WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT
. .
Underwood's Deviled Ham
if you have it on hand, will help greatly
to entertain the unexpected guest.
It's an old-fashioned product — made
honestly and pure of HAM and pure
spices — nothing else.
All first class dealers sell it.
Look on the can for the little red devil.
Wm. Underwood Co., Boston, Mass.
