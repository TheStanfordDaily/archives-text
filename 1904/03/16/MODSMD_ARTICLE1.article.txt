# LAST KEYSTONE LAID.
## Impressive Exercises Attend the Completion of the Outer Quadrangle. 
### 
After six years of almost continu
ous work the last keystone in the
outer quadrangle was putin place
yesterday afternoon with simple
but most impressive ceremonies.
Upon the speakers' stand, tempor
arily erected for the occasion, were
seated Dr. Jordan, Rev.Gardner, (J.
K. Field, '95, E. G. Brua, president
of the Senior class, I. Russell,'o4,
and C. H. Baker. '04.
The six hundred students and
members of the faculty who attend
ed the exercises opened the cere
monies by singing ''Hail, Stanford,
Hail." Rev. D. Charles Gardner
gave the opening prayer. The open
ing address was delivered by E.
G. Brua, president of the Class of
1904. He spoke a 6 follows:
"We are gathered to lay the key
stone of the last arch of the outer
quadrangle. Three and one-half
years ago things were different.
When the Class of 1904 entered
Stanford the walls of Memorial
Church were but half completed.
Many of the buildings of the outer
quadrangle which are now occupied
were in their beginning, and several
more were not begun. We have
seen the completion of these build
ings, and the exceptional privi
lege of laying the last stone has
fallen to the Class of 1904.
Brua then introduced Dr. Jordan,
who spoke briefly upon the sig
nificance to the University of tins
event. Dr. Jordan reviewed the
earliest days of the University and
then said:
"The period known as the 'hard
times' then came on. We realized
that the buildings would be put up
sometime. We looked at the beau
tiful engraving of the original plan
of the University, but decided it
would never he realized until our
alumni grew up and became rich.
You have seen all these difficulties
disappear. You have seen the
property rise in value and he extri
cated from all the various difficul
ties which beset it. You have seen
all these buildings grow up until
there remains but the dropping of
the remaining keystone in its
place. These buildings grew up
slowly but they are large, and
their construction has been neces
sarily long. Yet there has never
been a like institution grow up so
quickly. Departments are now
short-handed. But with the com
pletion of the buildings there will
lie a change. The present genera
tion of students will see the Uni
versity, itself, tower above the
ordinary college as the beautiful
buildings now tower above those of
the ordinary college."
Charles K. Field, '95, expressed
in sincere terms the feelings of an
alumnus on the completion
of the outer quadrangle. He
recalled the days of the pioneer
class, and told how the students of
the early days looked forward,
almost without hope, to the carry
ing out of the University buildings
as originally designed. In closing
he said, "Today the long looked for
wonder is finally accomplished —
the outer quadrangle is finished;

the inner quadrangle lias become a
shrine; the house is finished; the
heirs are moving in."
I. Russell, '04, responded to the
last speaker in behalf of the Class
of 1904. He spoke in part as fol
lows: ''With the opening of this
long, new sweep of arches the inner
quad, with its church set as a jewel
in a charmed circle, will take on
new significance. Simply to meet
the stream of life that will every
day ebb and How through these
arches will be in itself an education
in economics, and simply to know
these arcades intimately will be an
education in itself, an education in
the poetry of life.
"In more ways than one has this
generation directly inherited from
the pioneers the mantle of the
pathfinder. We have had to fit
their spirit in a vastly different
environment. So may we say
indeed, that the closing of
these arcades marks the closing of
the free, creative youth of the Uni
versity and its entry into its more,
stable life."

the outer quadrangle is finished;

the inner quadrangle lias become a
shrine; the house is finished; the
heirs are moving in."
I. Russell, '04, responded to the
last speaker in behalf of the Class
of 1904. He spoke in part as fol
lows: ''With the opening of this
long, new sweep of arches the inner
quad, with its church set as a jewel
in a charmed circle, will take on
new significance. Simply to meet
the stream of life that will every
day ebb and How through these
arches will be in itself an education
in economics, and simply to know
these arcades intimately will be an
education in itself, an education in
the poetry of life.
"In more ways than one has this
generation directly inherited from
the pioneers the mantle of the
pathfinder. We have had to fit
their spirit in a vastly different
environment. So may we say
indeed, that the closing of
these arcades marks the closing of
the free, creative youth of the Uni
versity and its entry into its more,
stable life."
The ceremonies closed with the
laying of the stone by E. G. Brua
and I. Russell for the Senior class.
