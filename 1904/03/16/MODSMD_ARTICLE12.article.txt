The ceremonies that attended
the placing of the last keystone in
the outer quadrangle yesterday
afternoon mark a critical point in
the life of the University. The
outer quadrangle, comprising a
majority of the buildings of the
University, stands practically com
pleted, and its completion is signifi
cant in that the University has
shown its power to steadily pro
gress along definitely established
lines in spite of temporary dis
couragements and reverses. The
buildings at Stanford are unique
in design and magnificent in exe
cution; and now that the ground
work has been completed, there is
no reason that the University, dif
ferentiated from its buildings,
should not become as imposing a
figure in the educational life of this
country as the buildings now are
in the architecture of this state. Jt
is gratifying that the significance
of this occasion was not unnoticed
by the undergraduates, and that
the Senior class conducted a simple
ceremony which will serve to mark
yesterday as a landmark in the
life of the University. One who
lias lived long under the influence
of Stanford life can not but feel a
strong love for the buildings and
what they typify, and as the
already Ibeautiful quadrangle is
improved it will become more than
ever the central thought in a re
membrance of the Universit}'.
