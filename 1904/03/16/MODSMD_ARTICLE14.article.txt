# Amateurism at Brown.
## 
### 
The action taken by the hoard of
directors of the Brown University
Athletic Association some time
ago, whereby men who had accept
ed money for athletics when not in
college were declared eligible for the
Brown varsity teams, has been
overruled by the action of the ex
ecutive and advisory committees of
Brown University Corporation.
The action of theathleticcommittee
in allowing professionals to play
on the college teams created a great
deal of discussion among Eastern
college people and those interested
in amateur sport.
The executive and advisory
committees of Brown University
Corporation, at a meeting on Feb
ruary 26th, passed the following
resolution unanimously:
"Since the change in the athletic
eligibility rules involves far-reach
ing consequences of an educational,
social and moral character, and
therefore should not be made with
out mature consideration, we here
by direct that such change shall
not be put into operation until it
has received official consideration
and approval by the corporation.
We therefore call upon the board
of directors of the Brown Univer
sity Athletic Association to allow
no games under changed rules un
til action shall have been taken by
the corporation at its annual meet
ing in September, 1904."
When the vote was made public,
the seven members of the Brown
Athletic Committee responsible for
the change in the eligibility rules
resigned.
