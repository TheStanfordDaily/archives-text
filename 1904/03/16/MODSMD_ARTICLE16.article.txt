Just,when we all get complacent
ly settled into believing that "Stan
ford spirit" is something real,some
thing which stands for honor and
courtesy toward all with whom we
come in contact, the unexpected
happens, and we find that some
students at this University still
need instruction in morals.
The occasion of this communica
tion is merely to remind those who
need it that when a sister univer
sity sends advertising matter to
Stanford prior to such a perform
ance as "The Jealous Wife," that
material, he it poster, handbill, or
what not, remains the property of
California and should be respected
as such.
If we must steal, let us steal
from ourselves. H. 11. Johnson.
