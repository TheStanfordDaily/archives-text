# Try-out for Olympian Team.
## 
### 
The final contest to decide which
athletes shall represent the Pacific
Coast in the Olympian games at the
St. Louis Exposition will be held
on the track of the University of
California on April 23d. This is
the third and last try-out, the first
having been held in May last and
the second on October 23d. The
coming contest will also decide the
Pacific Coast championships. The
contests are under the jurisdiction
of the Pacific Amateur Athletic
Association, and any registered
amateur may enter. Because of the
dual nature of the meet, it is
believed that a large number of
athletes will enter. Stanford Uni
versity and the University of Cali
fornia will be represented by some
of their best men.
At the head of the Stanford men
will he Captain Holman of the
track team. Holman will run in
the mile, which is his special dis
tance. He won the mile easily in
the last intercollegiate field-day in
the time of 4:41 3-5. He is good
for better time than that if he is
pressed. W. F. Dunn, '04, Stan
ford's best 440-yard man, will also
take part. He is the best quarter
mile on the Coast and has run the
distance under 51 seconds. Cross
man, '04, another 440-sprinter, is
also likely to enter the contest.
Gay, '04, may enter in the mile.
In the sprints, H. B. Hamilton,'o4,
will probably try for a place.
In the field events Stanford will
be well represented. The most
interesting entry will he that of
Norman Dole, '04, in the pole
vault. Dole's remarkable perform
ance in the last intercollegiate field
day has aroused the hope that he
will be able to break the world's
record. Dole in that competition
went over the bar at 11 feet 7f

inches, breaking the Pacific Coast
amateur record, the Pacific Coast
intercollegiate record, the Western
college record, and coining within 2 j
inches of the world's record. Dole
has been showing up very well
since then. J. M. Beach, '04. will
also jirobably enter the pole
vault. He won second place in
the intercollegiate contest last
year at 11 feet 1 inch. West,
'06, is likely to enter for the
broad jump. He has been doing
very well in practice, going beyond
the distance that won the intercol
legiate last year.
