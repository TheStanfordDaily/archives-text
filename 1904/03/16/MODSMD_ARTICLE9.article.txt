# Artistic Poster on Exhibition.
## 
### 
The poster advertising the pro
duction of "The Jealous Wife" by
the Mask and Dagger dramatic
society of the University of Cali
fornia, which was placed on exhi
bition today, is one of the most
artistic pieces of work that has
been displayed at Stanford for
some time. The figure of a beauti
ful woman, with a dagger dramati
cally clasped in her hand, is printed
on light gray cardboard. The
play, as the poster announces, was
originally given under the auspices
of the Associated Women Students
of the University of California in the
MaeDonough theatre in Oakland.
It will lie repeated in Assembly
Hall next Saturday night under
the auspices of Sword and San
dals.
