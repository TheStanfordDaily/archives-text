# JUNIOR FARCE PROGRESSING.
## Tickets Will Be on Sale Monday, March 21st.â€”Music Being Printed. 
### 
Tickets for the Junior Farce will
be placed on sale on the quad at
8:30 Monday, March 2lst. The
prices of seats have been set at
seventy-five cents and one dollar.
In case there are any seats left
after the sale on the quad, they
will be taken to the Bookstore and
the Stanford Pharmacy in Palo
Alto. As this is the only original
farce to be presented here this year,
it is expected that an unusual sale
of tickets will be made.
The usual art poster, advertising
the Junior Farce, has been de
signed by P. C. Bubb, '04, and will
be in evidence on the campus and
in Palo Alto next Saturday. The
design of the poster portrays a
Junior in plug, corduroys and
Varsity sweater, with the arches
and arcades of the quadrangle for
a background. The poster is an
attractive and effective piece of
work, and from an artist's stand
point is well executed. It is in
two colors, red and black. No
sale of posters will be made this
year, as the same design has been
used on music now being printed.
Both the words and music of
"The Man from Mizzoury," a two
step written especially for the farce
by M. H. Thorpe, '05, will go on
sale at the same time that the
tickets are placed on sale. It will
be in sheet form and the cover will
bear the poster design. Saleof the
music will take the place of the
customary poster sale. The copy
right to the piece has been secured
by a San Francisco music house,
and only a limited number of cop
ies will he available for sale by the
Farce Committee.
Rehearsals for the farce are
being held every evening under
the direction of Paul Gerson
of San Francisco. The main body
of the play is now rounding into
presentable form, and practice with
the University Orchestra, which
will form a prominent part of the
musical feature of the farce, begins
tonight. The choruses and the
other features of the play will also
be rehearsed for the first time this
evening. C. H. Baker, '04, has
been added to the cast of charac
ters as originally announced in
place of I). R. Wilson, '06, who
will be unable to take part.
