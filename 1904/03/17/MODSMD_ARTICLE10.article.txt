### 
The student hod}' treasurer has
arranged for a baseball game with
the team, composed largely of Stan
ford alumni, which played an
eleven-inning tie with the Varsity
on Tuesday, March Bth. Resides
affording an opportunity to decide
which is the better team, the mid
week contest will give the Varsity
a chance to get the practice which
can be obtained from competition
alone.
