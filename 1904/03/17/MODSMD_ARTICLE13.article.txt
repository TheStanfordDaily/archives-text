Ihe enterprise that lias led the
faculty committee in charge of
musical productions at Stanford to
secure Madame Schumann-Heinck
for a concert in Assembly Hall is
extremely praiseworthy. Her in
ternational reputation allows her
to demand an almost prohibitive
rate, and it is a sincere tribute to
the long-headedneßS and daring of
the committee that they are willing
to take the responsibility of bring
ing her to a community as email as
this one. The preceding chamber
concerts have not met with the
general support that their worth
should have called forth, but this
was no doubt due to the price of
tickets and the fact that the music
was of so technical a nature that it
did not appeal to the great major
ity of us. Neither of these objec
tions holds true in the case of
Madame Schumann-Heinck, how.
ever, for the price of seats will be
remarkably cheap when contrasted
with the prices customarily charged
to hear her, and her voice will be
equally beautiful to the student of
music and the one who is merely
attracted by a fine singer. There
seems to be no reason that she
should not find a crowded house
upon the night of her concert, and
in fact nothing else can be expected,
But several times in the past a
really first-class attraction has
failed to receive good support owing
to a lack of general understanding
in regard to the advantages offered.
Unquestionably the approaching
concert by Madame Schumann-
Heinck will be one of the finest
musical productions that has ever
come to this University, and it is to
be hoped that the community as a
whole will support the committee
which has secured her.
