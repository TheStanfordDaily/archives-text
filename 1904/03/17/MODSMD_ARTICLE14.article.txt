In connection with the-editorial
comment in the Alumnus of the
necessity for class secretaries at
Stanford, the following article tell

ing of the difficulties and duties
of these men at Yule is reprinted
from the Yale Alumni Weekly.
The Association of Yale Class
Secretaries met and held a banquet
and business meeting at the Yale
Club in New York, Friday night,
February 26th, at which twenty
secretaries, representing classes
from 1847 to 1904, were present.
The meeting was a very helpful
one, as it gave the secretaries an
opportunity to come together in 11
friendly and informal way and
talk over some of the knotty prob
lems of a secretaryship. A consid
erable portion of the evening was
put upon the discussion of the de
linquent secretary. This same
question of how to stir up delin
quents was discussed at the first
meeting of the association last
year, and the secretary of the as
sociation, Mr. Slier ril 1, being
authorized to make investigations,
had some correspondence with
class secretaries who had been very
remiss in their official duties. The
correspondence showed that lack of
time was apparently the cause
which kept secretaries from doing
their work.
In spite of the incalculable bene
fit these secretaries do to Yale and
her alumni, and in spite of the
position of honor that is given
them by Yale men, some appear to
be delinquent. Nevertheless the
innovation is one that should be
tried at Stanford, and the present
Senior class will do well if it insti
tutes a custom both necessary and
inevitable.
