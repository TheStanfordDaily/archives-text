### 
Charles Scribner's Sons have
made a preliminary announcement
of the publication of "The Student's
Old Testament," by Dr. Charles
Foster Kent, Woolsey Professor of
Biblical Literature in Yale. This
work represents a great many years
of general and special preparation
on the part of an author who is
already known to a very large
number of Bible students through
his "History of the Hebrew People"
and his volumes in the "Messages
of the Bible." Its plan is quite
original, and as far as one can
judge from a preliminary announce
ment and from a knowledge of the
author, promises to add to the
library of the studious layman a
statement in such simple, original
and thorough form of the practical
results of Old Testament study in
modern times as will enable him to
judge the practical value of this
scholarship for himself. That will
be an immense gain. More than
that, it should, if the present pros
pect for it is realized, enable a
Bible reader to appreciate both
from its religious and from its liter
ary side the Old Testament as he
probably has not been able to ap
preciate it before.
