Tlie Comfortable Way.
Now that the Santa Fe has made
a cheap rate to the St. Louis
World's Fair, everybody wishes to
go that way. They say that the
trains do not jar or rack the nerves;
the trainmen are polite and help
women and children; and in every
way it is comfortable. And the
cheap rate is good on the finest
trains. If interested ask about it at
641 Market street, San Francisco.
Moral: The Santa Fe is the
comfortable way.
