# ROWING WITH CALIFORNIA
## Stanford Boat Club Will Probably be Represented in Unofficial Freshman Race. 
### 
The Stanford Boat Club has
completed arrangements for si
Freshman race with the University
of California, which will almost
certainly be held, although it will
probably not be sanctioned as an
intercollegiate event by the Athletic
Committee. The date has not yet
been set, but the meet will come off
sometime during the latter part of
April. The race will not be under
the auspices of the Associated Stu
dents because boating is not yet a
regular intercollegiate sport. The
race will be held at Berkeley be
cause the course at Stanford is too
short.
This department of athletics is
well developed at California, but at
Stanford it is yet in the experi
mental stage. If the coming meet
is a success, boating will undoubt
edly be on the list of intercollegiate
events next year. At that time it
is expected that both Freshman
and Varsity races will be held.
There are numbers of men in the
Freshman class who have turned
out for boating practice, so the
competition for places on the crew
will be keen. It is undecided as
yet what kind of races will be held,
but in all probability there will be
a sculling match and a race be
tween pair-oared boats. There are
several men who have had more or
less experience in both these lines.
Among the most promising Fresh
men who have shown up so far are
F. Zimmerman, C. E. Bee and A.
Ilosenfeld. All these men have
rowed before; Zimmerman and
Bosenfeld were members of the
Portland Rowing Club, and Bee
rowed in the Boston Preparatory
School Association. With these
men and several more nearly as
good, Stanford should be represent
ed by a strong team.
By next year the Boat Club will
be established on a firm basis.
It expects to own a piece of land
on the slough where a permanent
boat-house will be built. The
boat-house will be commodious and
will be fitted with lockers and
shower-baths. A practice course
two miles long will be laid out,and
when these plans are completed
yearly regattas with be held with
both the University of California
and the University of Washington.
