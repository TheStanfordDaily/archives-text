# Discuss a Freshman Race.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Athletic
Committee last night, a discussion
was held in regard to the advisa
bility of including a Freshman
boat race as one of the regular inter
collegiate contests between Stanford
and California. No definite action
in regard to ihe matter was taken
at last night's meeting. A letter
from California was read, the exe
cutive committee of that institution
stating that a financial motive
alone prompted them to refuse the
proposed amendment to the inter
collegiate agreement whereby the
Freshman football game would
have been held at Stanford next
year. No other business was at
tended to except the sanctioning.of
a change in the manner of choosing
the doubles team for the intercol
legiate tennis match.
