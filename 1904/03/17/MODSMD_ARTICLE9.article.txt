# To Circulate " Daily Palo Alto."
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents last night it was decided to
send a copy of the Daily Palo Alto
to every high school and prepara
tory school of the State, and to some
of the more prominentschools of the
adjoining states, from the present
time until the end of the semester.
The expense of printing and mail
ing will, be one cent a copy. Sev
eral years ago copies of the Daily
Palo Alto were circulated among
the most prominent schools of the
State, but the practice was not kept
up. The idea is to have the paper
in the libraries and on the reading
tables of the preparatory schools as
commencement approaches, so that
the students about to graduate may
become interested in Stanford life
and sports. Interest awakened in
this way, it is believed, will result
in many students choosing Stan
ford when they come to select the
university which they will attend.
The Executive Committee voted
$10 for the improvement of the
women's basket-ball court, so that
practice might be held for the ap
proaching games with the Univer
sity of California and Mills Col
lege.
