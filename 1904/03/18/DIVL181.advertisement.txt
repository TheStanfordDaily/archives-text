Pocket-book Philosophy
College men are usually " well
built " and easily fit.
A ready-to-wear suit looks as
well, wears as well, and costs a
third less than a custom-made suit.
Suppose you think it over.
Ask for Benjamin Clothes. You'll
like them.
"Be fair to your
face." Use Williams'
Shaving Soap.
