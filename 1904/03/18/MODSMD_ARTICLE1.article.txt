The prologue, written by Profes

"The Jealous Wife," like many of
the other comedies dnting from
Garrick's time, is n play that
makes a very direct appenl to a
modern audience. The characters
are strongly defined, the nction is
quick, nnd the dialogue has the
pi thy force thnt is found in"The
Rivnls" nnd "She Stoops to Con
quer." It is primarily an acting
comedy, nnd the fact thnt Garrick
himself collnbornted in the work
manship is significant.
It is the headstrong love of the
heroine, Harriet, that brings her to
London and involves her in tangled
relationships with her doting, im
perious father, her three admirers,
her scheming nnd fashionable aunt,
and the unhappy Onkley and his
wife. The strife for her hand nnd
affections is hnrd fought. The first
lover, n zealous follower of the
hounds; is warmly supported by
her fnther, but the counter nttrac
tions of a brown mnre nre too great
for Sir Harry, and he withdraws
his claims in the end.
Lord Trinket has in his favor
title nnd station nnd the resource
ful nssistnnce of Lady Freelove,
Hnrriet's aunt. But the instru
ment of their intrigues, in the per
son of the redoubtable Captain
O'Cutter, whose cheerful delight in
accepting nny commission "when n
tront is to be cut" is his most win
some trnit, brings to confusion
their most ingeniously laid plans,
nnd involves them in disgrnce that
only their inborn sense of superior
ity enn mitignte. How Charles
thrends his way through this com
plicated tangle, in spite of the

beguiling influence of the worldly
major, is too long u story to tell
here.
Meantime, nil this action centers
about the unhappy Mrs. Oakley,
whose jealous disposition leads her
to interpret each new development
as more convincing evidence of the
perfidy of her husband. With his
brother, the Major, counselling
firmness of resistance on the one
hand, and his affection for his wife
disposing him to submission on the
other, Oakley lias a hard time of
it. It is in this situation that the
main dramatic interest of the piny
centers, and these two parte, that
of the husband and the wife, have
been given to actors of experience
and power—Mr.Kruschke and Miss
Howard. The noting of Mr. Mark
Daniels, as Lord Trinket, has also
received great praise. In fact, it is
the uniformly high standard of act
ing mnintained by the entire cast
thnt is the most striking testimony
of those who have seen the piny.
Thnt is ns much ns snying thnt the
delightful charm of this entertain
ing old comedy, with all its human
interest, will be brought out in the
performance Saturdny evening.
