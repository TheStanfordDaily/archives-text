Tomorrow night " The Jealous
Wife" will be given in Assembly
Hull by Mask and Dagger, the
dramatic society of the University
of California. The members of
Sword and Sandals, under whose
auspices the play will be given at
Stanford, have done everything in
their power to ensure an enthusi
astic reception for the players from
the State University. But the
University community has still its
share to perform. Every first-class
attraction that comes to Stanford
deserves the support of the student
body; but when a good play comes
from a rival college, reasons of
courtesy should prompt us to make
the presentation a success. When
the "Knight of the Burning
Pestle " was taken to Berkeley last
year California men did everything
possible to see that the members of
the company were cordially re
ceived. Let us try to outdo them
in this act of politeness and let us
be sufficiently in evidence tomorrow
night so that there will not be an
empty seat in Assembly Hall.
