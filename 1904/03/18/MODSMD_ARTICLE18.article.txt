# WILL SING AT STANFORD.
## Arrangements Are Being Made by Faculty Music Committee for Concert by Schumann-Heinck. 
### 
The faculty music committe is
working diligently in the attempt
to make the last of the Chamber
Concerts the most successful of the
series. That their efforts will be
well rewarded is assured by the
fact that Madame Schumann-
Heinck has been secured to appear
in the final concert, which will be
given April Bth. Her reputa
tion as a vocalist is world-wide,and
the recital will therefore draw an
audience larger, undoubtedly, than
any of the previous concerts.
Madame Schumann-Heinck will
give only a limited number of con
certs during her tour of the Pacific
Coast, and the recital at Stanford
will probably prove a great attrac
tion to people in neighboring towns.
A special train will be run from
San Jose to accommodate the people
from there who wish to hear the
famous singer.
When she last appeared at Stan
ford, lAssembly Hall was crowded
to its doors, people coming from
points as far distant as Santa Cruz
to hear her.
