# DEBATE TEAM CHOSEN.
## Lewis, Roehr and Sherriffs Will Represent Stanford Against California.â€”Blair Chosen Alternate. 
### 
Al the final try-out for the Inter
collegiate team held Saturday
night the following men were
chosen hy the judges to represent
Stanford this year in the debate
against California: H. M. Lewis,
'04, F. Roehr, '04, and A. Sherriffs,
'05, with \V. L Blair, '05, as alter
nate. The team consists of the
same men who represented Stan
ford in the Carnot debate against
California last month. Lewis and
Roehr were also on both the Inter
collegiate and the Carnot teams
last year, while Sherriffs was a
member of the second team, which
debated against the University of
Washington.
Of the two squads the first was
composed of Harnett, '05, and
Sales, '00, for the affirmative, and
Lewis, '04, and Koehr, '04, for the
negative. The argument followed
by the affirmative was well handled
by both speakers while their deliv
ery was forceful and direct. Lewis,
in opening for the negative, limited
himself principally to a line of
argument which emphasized the
theoretical side of the question.
Roehr, in closing, gave an excel
lent summary of the different
points developed during the argu
ment. The speeches of both men
were clear and well delivered.
In the second squad the affirma
tive was supported by Sherriffs, '05,
0.-good, '06, and Swing, '05; and
the negative by Cunha, '06, and
Blair, '05. Sherriffs followed a
persuasive introduction with a well
developed line of argument, and
was especially strong in his re
buttal. Blair had a quiet, pleas
ing manner of delivery, and at
tacked the arguments of the affir
mative with vigor. The other
speakers supplemented well with
team work the positions of the two
successful candidates.
The debate as a whole showed a
lack of thorough preparation, due
to the shortness of time intervening
between the announcement of the
subject and the try-out. All speak
ers showed up well, however, so
that there is promise of good ma
terial for next year. The speeches
were limited to ten minutes and
the judges were some time in com
ing to a decision at the conclusion
of the debate.
