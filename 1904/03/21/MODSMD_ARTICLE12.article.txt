# COLMAN'S COMEDY PRESENTED.
## University of California Actors Give Interesting Production of "The Jealous Wife." 
### 
The presentation of the old Eng
lish comedy, The Jealous Wife,"
by the Mask and Dagger dramatic
society of the University of Cali
fornia was an entertaining perform
ance of high merit. There was a
large attendance, and the full ap
preciation of the audience was
evidenced by the satisfaction with
which the efforts of the cast were
received.
The comedy, in spite of its age,
is one which appeals very strongly
to a modern audience on account
of the bright dialogue and the
amusing situations. The acting of
California's amateurs was of high
quality and the previous success of
the production was shown to have
been well earned.
All the action centers around
the jealous and unfortunate Mrs.
Oakley, who believes each new de
velopment to be evidence of the de
ceit of her husband. This situation
between the unhappy husband and
the jealous wife is the center of
dramatic interest of the play. Mr.
Kruschke took the part of Mr.
Oakley and Miss Howard appeared
as the jealous Mrs. Oakley. Miss
Howard's portrayal of this charac
ter was very realistic and her act
ing throughout was far above the
general amateur standard. Mr.
Mark Daniels, as Lord Trinket, did
some unusually fine work. Mr.
Keane, as Major Oakley, also
has much ability as an actor and
Walter De Leon, as Captain O'Cut
ter, proved to be a clever artist.
The whole production was a credit
to California's dramatic talent, and
their visit was a thoroughly suc
cessful one.
