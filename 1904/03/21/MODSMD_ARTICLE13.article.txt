# Large Sale of Seats for Farce.
## 
### 
Seats for"The Man From Miz
zoury" were placed on sale on the
quad this morning at 8:30. The
opening sale was unusually large.
Nearly all the lower floor was sold
by noon at the Stanford Pharmacy
in Palo Alto and on the quad.
There is still a number of both $1
and 75-cent seats to be had. These
are on sale at the Bookstore and
at the Stanford Pharmacy. The
present indications are that the farce
will be played before a crowded
house, and that it will be necessary
to sell standing room on the night
of its presentation.
