museum is doing in an unpreten
tious way a work that in the future
will undoubtedly prove to he of in
calculable benefit to the University
and its alumni and undergraduates.
Nevertheless these same undergrad
uates and alumni have assumed an
attitude of indifference in regard to
this work. A collection of picture?
books, posters,original manuscripts,
anything of a literary or artistic
nature that relates peculiarly to
Stanford, is being made. The value
of such a collection in years to
come, if it can be made reasonably
complete, can hardly be calculated
at the present time. First of all, as
an adjunct to the Museum it is of
the greatest importance. The cur
ator states that at the present time
the partial collection that is on ex
hibition is of the deepest interest to
visitors. It gives them a touch of
the real Stanford life. But beyond
this, as presenting in an interesting
way different phases of Stanford
history, the collection will be very
important. It is within the power
of the alumni and the undergradu
ates to aid the curator very materi
ally in his work. The alumni
must have in their possesion many
Stanford souvenirs which are of
little value isolated, but which
would be very useful in helping to
fill an incomplete set. Many un
dergraduates of today, unthinking
ly destroy pictures and posters that
ten years from now could be dupli
cated only with the greatest diffi
culty. It is to be hoped that no one
with any souvenirs in his posession
will hesitate from selfish motives
to put them at the disposal of the
Museum. A plan that might be
adopted would be to make it a
custom for every committee, class
or student body, which has charge
of any University event or any
class production to preserve at the
expense of the class or student body
some record of the event, by photo

graph if possible, and always by
whatever printed announcement
there may be. A copy of such mat
erial if regularly placed in the cur
ator's hands would do considerable
to lighten his labors and would aid
materially in the work of gathering
together a complete record.
