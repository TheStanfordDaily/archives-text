Chamber Concert. —The Faculty
Music Committee desires to apolo
gize for the unfortunate condition
of affairs existing in regard to the
seating for the Schumann-Heinck
concert. The intention was that
holders of season tickets should hold
them, if they desired, but in order
that no desirable seat should be
left vacant, the subcription seats
should be exchanged for regular
tickets entitling the holder to his
same seat. Owing to a misunder
standing, however, the drawing of
tickets was not carried out on this
plan, and several subscribers were
forced to take less desirable seats
than they had previously held.
In order to make such amends
as may be in the power of the
committee at the present time, the
full chart of the Hall as it now
stands will be thrown open to sea
son subscribers in order that they
may exchange such undesirable
seats as they now hold for the best
that are to be had.
Committee.
