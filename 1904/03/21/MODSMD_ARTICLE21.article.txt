At the services in Memorial
Church Sunday Rev. D. Charles
Gardner gave his third discourse of
the series on the " Hope of Immor
tality,' 1 dealing this time with the
Christian's belief. The philosophic
arguments for immortality are not
convincing. It must ever remain
a matter of religion rather than
science. For the Christian, his
belief has its highest expression in
the teachings of Jesus Christ. In
the eager, practical minds of college
students there is often an honest
doubt seeking to harmonize the
highest religion and the highest
science. To such that terrible
creed is unbearable which would
rob the life of its hope of immor
tality, and would see the end of
all in the coliin and in the grave.
The Christian religion is some
thing simple and sublime. The
chief concern of Christ's religion
is the state of man toward God.
The highest aim of man in the
light of the gospel is social Ciiris
tianity. It is to man to whom
religion attains. The Christian
takes the life eternal as part of the
accepted gospel, the life of con
scious unionism with the Maker.
In natural man the hope of immor
tality is an instinct; in spiritual
man this instinct has grown into
a belief and a motive which lifts
him to higher aspirations. This
belief is exemplified in the words
of Christ, "Father, into thyihands
I commend my spirit." On survi
val after death rests the super
structure of all Christian re
ligion, which is belief in God,
love of the Maker, and hope of life
eternal.
The true conception of Heaven
does not imply a state of idleness
and ease. The holy scripture does
not speak of such a condition, hut
says it shall be a place of right
eousness. A place of righteousness
must be a place of action, of per
sonal ministering to the wants of
one another.
Whatever comes to mar one's
belief, it is his duty to cling to the
hope of immortality. It is the
substantial fixture in the evolution
of human character.
