# Coach Doyle Left Today.
## 
### 
Charles Doyle, head baseball
coach, left for the East todaj' to
join the Montreal professional
team. Doyle was engaged with
the understanding that he should
coach up to the time when he
would be required to join his team
for the coming season of professional
baseball. He will pitch for the
Canadian team and should be in
good condition for the opening of
the season, as he has had practice
while coaching.
Most of the coaching has been
been done, but Doyle leaves at a
critical time as it is just before the
intercollegiate matches that the
team needs him most. The coach
ing will be taken in charge by
Captain Ball and D. V. Cowden
'03, who captained the'o2 Varsity.
Meanwhile Cowden is trying to
secure the services of J. F. Lana
gan, '00, for the remainder of the
season. It is doubtful whether
Lanagan will be able to put
in the full time necessary to proper
ly coach the team, but it is certain
that he will at least aid the Varsity
at times during the remainder of
the season.
