# TRAINING TO BE HARDER.
## Track Men May be Taken Over to the Stock Farm for Work. 
### 
The training of the track men
from this time until the day of the
intercollegiate meet will be harder.
Trainer Moulton has decided
that the standard shall he
raised, and every man will be
required to do his best. The great
handicap under which trainer and
men are laboring is the condition
of the track. The constant rain
for the past two weeks has left it
in extremely bad condition, and it
will take several days of fair weather
to improve it to any degree. Only
the side and end of the track near
est Encina Hall can be used, and
as a consequence the men are at a
great disadvantage. An effort has
been made to find soil suitable for
use in improving the bed of the
track, but careful search of the
entire campus and of Palo Alto has
failed to discover any earth that
would serve for this purpose. All
that remains to do is to wait until
the clay of the present bed dries
out and then to roll it. The run
ways for the jumps have also been
seriously affected by the rain, and
the men have been unable to use
them on some days.
It is not unlikely that the men
will be taken over to the old speed
track at the Stock Farm and put to
work there, as was done last year.
The track there is excellent for ath
letic work under ordinary circum
stances, but the late rains may
have made it too soft. This track
is a half mile oval and is especially
valuable for the work of the dis
tance men, who are to receive the
special attention of Trainer Moul
ton for some time. The work of
these men will be considerably
harder than it has been during the
past few weeks.
Arrangements for a training table
are now being made by Treasurer
Cowden. No date has yet been
fixed upon for its beginning. Last
year it was begun on the Monday
following the Easter vacation, and
this year it will probably begin al
most immediately after college
reopens. None of the men who are
considered point-winners will leave
the campus during the vacation,
but remain here and continue their
training.
The list of eligibles for the inter
collegiate meet has been prepared
and submitted to Dr. Angell, chair
man of the faculty committee on
athletics. Of all the names sub
mitted, only one has been struck
off by the scholarship committee.
The list will be sent to the Univer
sity of California on Saturday.
