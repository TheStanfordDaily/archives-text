The numerous attractions that
come to Stanford of a necessity call
for widespread advertisement, and
when carried along legitimate
lines such advertising is entirely
justifiable. But of late the beauty
of the campus has been marred to
a noticeable degree by the excesses
of which those posting notices have
been guilty. Gradually the field
of the bill poster has been widened,
until now the place surrounding
the track has been seized upon as
a profitable place for posters in
large letters and variegated colors.
If a halt is not called, the fence
will undoubtedly soon resemble a
city "dead wall." Even the quad
itself is being made ugly by the
array of posters and announce
ments in the different windows.
The present situation 6eems to be
one of advertising to excess. There
can be no objection to wide adver
tising of the attractions that come
here, but better judgment should
be used bo that the beauty of the
campus and of the quadrangle will
not be marred.
