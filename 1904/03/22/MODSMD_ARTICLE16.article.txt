A Yale man has made an inves
tigation of the prices charged for
college baseball games. In regard
to the result of this investigation
the Yale Alumni Weekly says:
"This investigator finds that the
price charged at Harvard to all
minor games is 50 cents. This
does not include a grandstand seat
for which 25 cents extra is charged.
The price of Harvard season tickets
for baseball is $3, anil admits to
all home games played by the Uni
versity nine, with the exception of
the championship games. This
year there are sixteen of these
home games. The price for the
Yale-llarvard game is $1.50. All
seats are reserved, and no admis
sion seats are sold to that game.
At Princeton the price at the
minor games is 35 cents a game.
This does not include a grandstand
seat which is 15 cents extra. There
are nine or ten other games at
which the admission is 50 cents,
while the price of championship
games, including admission and
grandstand seats, is $1.50. No
season tickets are sold at Princeton.
At the University of Pennsyl
vania the price for admission to
the smaller games is 75 cents and
50cents; and $1,75 and 50 cents
for the larger games, which include
Yale, Harvard, Princeton and Cor
nell. They, too, have a $5 season
ticket which brings the price of
baseball games down to about 14
cents or 15 cents for each game.
At Brown 50 cents is charged
for admission to every game and
50 cents extra for reserved seats.
Season tickets bring the price down
to about 25 cents per game.
At Yale the prices are below
those of any of the colleges named.
The admission price to games in
cluding a grandstand 6eat, is 35
cents. The price of admission to
the Harvard and Princeton games,
including a grandstand seat is
$1.25. For these games there are
also sold tickets for reserved bleach
er seats for $1, and unreserved
bleacher seats for 50 cents. For
reunion classes the price is still
further reduced to reserved bleach
er seats for 75 cents, it will thus
be seen that the Yale undergrad
uate can obtain an unreserved seat
for 50 cents at a championship
game, whereas at Harvard there is
only one price, namely $1.50; and
at Princeton the admission price
is 75 cents and the grandstand
seat is 75 cents.
In regard tose ison tickets theprice
at Yale is also relatively cheaper.
Three yearH ago season tickets
which were $3, were reduced to $2.
This year these tickets at $2 admit
to twelve games, bringing the price
down to a little over 16 cents per
game. Although the season ticket
was only $2 last season, surprising
ly few were sold."
A comparison with prices at
Stanford shows that the West occu
pies an average standard in regard
to admission prices to campus
games.
