# Freshmen Begin Training.
## 
### 
Arrangements for a Freshman
boat race with the University of
California have progressed far
enough to warrant the establish
ment of training rules. Each can
didate for the Freshman crew is
expected to keep strict training
rules after the present time. Each
Freshman candidate must fill out
a report every day indicating his
crew and coxwain. Candidates are
expected to row a course of four

laps, two to the left and two to the
right. This will be followed by a
cross country run of at least a
mile, and after the run there will be
a period of exercise on the wrist
machines. Following the exercise
the men will take a short swim,
and then will be given a brisk rub
down.
Strict training rules must be
observed by all candidates for the
Freshman crew, and by those men
trying out for next year's Varsity
crew who are substituting boating
for gymnasium. Onlookers will
not be allowed to smoke around
the boat-house, and upon leaving
the house the rowing men are
expected to see that boats and oars
are in their proper places and that
the doors are closed.
It has practically been decided
that the race with California will
be a four-oared barge event. There
are a number of Freshmen trying
out for the crew who have diplayed
considerable ability, and there is
every indication that the fight for
places on the crew will be a hard
one.
