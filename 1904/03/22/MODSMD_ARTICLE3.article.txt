## 
### 
N. Dole, '04, broke the world's
pole-vaulting record in practice
this morning. He cleared the bar
at 12 feet $ inch, which is 2\ inches
better than the vault of Clapp of
Yale. Clapp's record was made
some time ago, and is reported to
have been broken by a vaulter in
the Middle West, but it still stands
as the best recognized amateur
record. Dole went over the bar
this morning without any great
effort, and 'is reported by those
watching him to have cleared it
by two or three inches. He had
been vaulting 11 feet 44 inches,
and then put the bar up to what
was supposed to be 12 feet. On
the second try he went over easily.
The height was then carefully
measured by Trainer Moulton and
found to be 12 feet 112 inches.
Dole won the pole-vault in the
last intercollegiate meet in a little
over 11 feet. He continued vault
ing, however, and finally cleared 11
feet inches. This set a new
mark for the Pacific coast amateur
and intercollegiate record, and the
western college record. It was
also within 2f inches of the world's
record.
