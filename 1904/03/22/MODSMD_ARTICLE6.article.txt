# LABORATORY EQUIPPED.
## Metallurgy Building Fitted With Up-to-date Apparatus.â€”One of Best in United States. 
### 
Work has just been completed in
the equipping of the new Metallur
gical laboratory in the Metallurgy
building. The work of installing
and setting up the new apparatus
has taken several months, and the
department is now one of the
three best equipped of its kind in
the United States.
In the general laboratory are
desk accommodations for thirty
two students, or, working in sec
tions, sixty-four. Each desk is
equipped with air, gas and suction.
Hoods are so arranged that each
student may use one. The fumes
from the hoods are removed by
down-draught suction, thus doing
away with the overhead ventilation
of less up-to-date laboratories of
this nature. Combustion tables
are placed on one side of the room
with gas and electric combustion
furnaces, and electrolytic precipi
tating apparatus for experimental
work in connection with precipita
ting metals from solution by elec
tricity. A dark-room for metallur
gical work is fully equipped jvith
individual lockers and with outfits
for the developing of negatives
taken of micro-sections of iron and
steel. The balances are of the
Eimer & Amend pattern and are
extremely sensitive.
The furnace-room is supplied
with six gas furnaces and two elec
tric furnaces. The gas furnaces are
used in connection with all work
done in the laboratory in roasting,
cupellating and melting. The fur
naces are of the special design of
Professor Howe of Columbia Uni
versity, the leading metallurgist of
the United States, and are particu
larly well adapted for the work.
Columbia, Harvard and Stanford
are the only institutions in this
country using these. The furnaces
are all arranged so that the)' can
be electrically connected with a Le
Chatelier pyrometer for measuring
heat up to IGOO degrees Centigrade.
In the power-room are storage
batteries for the precipitating
work, a seven and one-half horse
power motor for driving all the
machinery, and a thirty-inch ex
haust-fan for the removing of the
fumes. The blast for the furnaces
is produced by a high-pressure
blower. There are polishing ma
chines for finishing metal sections.
In the ore-dressing room are
machines for treating metal for
the advanced work. There is a
hack-saw for cutting iron and steel
sections preparatory to polishing
for examination under the micro
scope, or for photographing.
Another laboratory for special
apparatus contains a Junker's
Calorimeter for determining the
value of gases and oils, a Mahler
Bomb Calorimeter for solid fuels,
a small cyanide testing plant for
ore and a drop-testing machine
used in connection with iron and
steel work.
No laboratory work will be
offered this semester, but beginning
with next semester five courses will
be offered in metallurgical work,

all of which will have more or lees
laboratory work in conncection
with them.
