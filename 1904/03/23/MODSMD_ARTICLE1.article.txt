# SYNOPSIS OF FARCE.
## "The Man from Mizzoury" Will Be Given in Assembly Hall Tomorrow Night. 
### 
The Junior Class will open its
festivities tomorrow evening at 8:15
by the presentation of "The Man
from Mizzoury" in Assembly Hall.
For ten days regular rehearsals
have been held, and although that
length of time has been short for
the preparation of a farce in volving
the number of features that appear
in this production, the later re
hearsals give promise of a thorough
ly successful presentation.
The main features of the play
are the ten songs and four full
choruses that put life into the farce
from the time the first curtain
rises until the end of the play. In
every scene there are comic situa
tions which are extremely clever.
The music is of excellent quality.
Part of it has already been pub
lished in sheet form, and there is a
probability of the full score being
sent to press.
The plot of the farce is laid at
Stanford and is colored throughout
with Stanford life. Local refer
ences are abundant. The first
scene portrays Charlie Hardrun's
room in Encina Hall. Several col
lege men are gathered there, and in
joking conversation with Charlie
give the audience tho key to the
situation. Young Hardrun, " The
Man from Mizzoury," is trying to
maintain a high social standing
on a monthly allowance of twenty
five dollars, and the situations into
which he is thrown with his cred
itors form much of the comedy of
the first part of the play. Easy
street, a philosopher whose methods
will not bear close scrutiny, is
introduced in the first scene, and
proves to be successful in finding a
solution to each difficulty encoun
tered by his fellows.
The second scene finds Dick,
Charley's roommate, at Roble Hall
explaining the inability of Charlie
and himself to keep an engagement
with their friends. The same scene
introduces Bosomandtail, Charlie's
rival, and the Roble Guard, one of
the leading features of the play.
In the first scene of the second
act a telegram, in answer to u
forged dispatch Kent by Bosomand
tail, informs Charlie and bis asso
ciates that Deacon Hardrun is on
his way West from Mizzoury to
visit his son, whom he believes
to 1)0 ill. Easyslreet puts Charlie
in bed and turns his quarters into
a sick-room to deceive the deacon.
The plan is successful, and the
scene closes with the old man's
acceptance of an invitation to join a
fictitious faculty fraternity.
In the last act the curtain is
raised on the initiation scene,
in which the deacon is put
through an amusing ceremony.
The father's troubles reach a climax
in the quad scene which opens the
third act. His difficulties in secur
ing the recognition of a number of
professors by use of the secret signs
of the fictitious fraternity exhausts
his patience. At this juncture he
learns from Bosomandtail that he
has been hazed, and that his son's
illness is also a sham.
The last scene brings about the

cooling of the deacon's wrath by
Easystreet. Several surprises fol
low in rapid succession, and cul
minate iu a dinner party in honor
of the deacon. The farce closes
with a chorus I >y the full cast.
Permanent fixtures have been
installed on Assembly Hall stage,
and two or three new sets of scenery
that have been added to the stage
property will be used in the farce
