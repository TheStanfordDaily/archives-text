Stanford has been peculiarly
fortunate during the past year in
regard to the number and variety
of first-class attractions that have
been given on the campus. The
approaching concert by Madame
Schumann-Heinck will crown the
musical attractions of the pres
ent year, and the production of
"Hamlet" by Ben Gleet's com
pany next semester will work a
climax in dramatic presentations
at Stanford. Ben Greet is famous
as a manager who dares to present
Shakspere to modern audiences
in a truthful and realistic manner.
He has been received with enthus
iasm throughout the United States,
especially at the different colleges
where his company has given
Shaksperean plays, and his pro
duction here of " Everyman " whs
enthusiastically received by the
critical element in the community.
The play of " Hamlet,'' given as
Mr. Greet proposes to give it, would
be a novel attraction to a Stanford
audience, and the English Club is
to be encourged in making an effort
to bring Mr. Greet to the campus
next semester.
