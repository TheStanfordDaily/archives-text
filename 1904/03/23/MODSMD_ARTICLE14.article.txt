# Abolition of Valedictorian.
## 
### 
A great (leal of discussion has
been aroused among Yale men over
the abolition of the valedictory and
salutatory orations during the
annual commencement exercises.

The objection to the custom of
choosing men for these purely hon
orary posiLions seems to have been
caused by the impossibility of
grading the many candidates with
justice under the present elective
system. That the men formerly
selected for the positions were not
unworthy is shown by the fact
that of the Yale valedictorians
forty-five are on what may be called
the life honor list, and of the salu
tatorians forty. The two lists to
gether register out of the one hun
dred and fifty-three valedictorians
and salutatorians eighty-five (about
fifty-six per cent.) who have won
success and distinction, the eighty
five including forty-one full pro
fessors, thirteen college presidents â€”
two of the presidents of Yale, one
of Columbia, and one of the Uni
versity of California; five judges
of high courts; and twenty-six in
other branches of life work; and, if
successful men of affairs are added
whose credentials do not appear in
the limbo of honorary degrees, the
remarkable ratio would be still
greater.
