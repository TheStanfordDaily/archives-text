# TO GIVE SHAKSPEREAN PLAY.
## Ben Greet's English Company to Render Five-Hour Version of "Hamlet." 
### 
Ben Greet, who produced "Every
man" and "Twelfth Night" here
with so much success last year, will
be here again with his company
about September and will give two
or three plays. Miss It. L. Kim
ball, '04, vice-president of the
â€¢English Club, has received a letter
from Mr. Greet expressing his re
gret that he can not come earlier,
but fixing the later date. Mr.
Greet proposes to make "Hamlet"
the principal play to be given here.
This production will be based upon
the first folio version of "Hamlet"
published in 1628, one of the two
distinct acting versions of Shaks
pere's perfect text, and containing
a number of passages which are not
found in the other version. The
production of this version will re
quire about five hours, and Mr.
Greet has suggested that it be given
in two installments. It would be
gin at 11 a.m. and be continued
until 1:15 p.m. The remainder
of the play could be given between
2:30 and 5 in the afternoon. It
might be shortened to some ex
tent.
It is proposed to give two other,
plays, and Mr. Greet has suggested
"The Merchant of Venice" and
one of the brighter comedies, prob
ably "Much Ado About Nothing."
The matter will be taken up by the
English Club early next semester
and definite arrangements made.
