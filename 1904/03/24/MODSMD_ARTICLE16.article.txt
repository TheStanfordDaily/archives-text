# SAN JOSE TEAM TO PLAY.
## Varsity Will Face Strong Opponents on Campus Diamond at 2:30 Saturday. 
### 
While the game wilh the Uni
versity of California is only nine
days distant, the Varsity is at the
same stage it was two weeks ago.
Continuous rains have made the
diamond unfit for practice and
prevented the team from playing
its scheduled games. This has been
a great handicap at this period in
the season, but if the weather is
fair during vacation the final prepa
ration will progress rapidly.
Captain Ball will have his men
out twice every day the coming
week. In the morning the time
will be devoted mainly to batting
practice. The afternoons will be
given over to practice games. Lan
agan is expected to come down
from Belmont several times during
the week and put the finishing
touches on the team.
The Varsity team is hard to
pick at the present time, but a
number of men by their consistent
playing throughout the season
have practically secured their posi
tions on the nine. Ball, catcher;
Williams, second base; Trowbridge,
short-stop; Wirt, center field; and
Swain, third base, will probably be
in the first game. Tritch will
probably pitch the first game, in
which case Sales may play in the
outfield. The two other positions
are first base and left field. Col
bert will probably play first, and
the other place will be filled by
either Chalmers or Knight.
Treasurer Cowden is trying to
arrange as many games as possible
before the intercollegiate contest.
Tomorrow the Varsity plays the
Independents, and on Saturday
Mayer Bros. Mid-week games
may be arranged with Mayer Bros.
The Mayer Bros.' team is practi
cally the San Jose professional
nine that has been playing such
good baseball lately. The person
nel of Mayer Bros.' follows: Kent,
catcher; Emerson or Frien,pitcher;
Hatch, first base; Allen, second
base; Erie, short-stop; Itussel, third
base; Hall, left field; Brown, center
field; Young, right field.
