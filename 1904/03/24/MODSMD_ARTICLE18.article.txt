# Will Exchange Concerts.
## 
### 
The musical clubs of Stanford
combined with those of the Univer
sity of California will give a con
cert at Berkeley on the evening of
April 2d, the day of the first inter
collegiate baseball game. A return
concert will be given by the two
university clubs at Stanford on the
evening of the second baseball game,
which will be played April 9th.
A similar program was followed
last year by the same clubs and
was very successful.
