ball team was defeated by the team
of the University of California on
the Iloble court this afternoon.
The score was 11 to 4 in favor of
the visitors. The Stanford women
showed the better team work, hut
the excellent play of individual
members of the California team
was too much to be overcome.
Especially in guarding their goals
did the California girls excel. The
work of Miss Lillian Wright, and
Miss Mary Shafter, the California
captain, was especially noticeable.
Miss J. Spalding, '06, and Miss
M. Betz, '06, did the best work of
the Stanford team. Miss M. Ray,
'05, who played only in the second
half, also showed up very well.
Good work on both sides won fre
quent applause.
