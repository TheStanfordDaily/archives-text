# POMONA MEET TOMORROW.
## Southern Athletes Will Contest With Stanford Runners and Jumpers. 
### 
The track meet with Pomona
College will be held-on the oval at
2:30 tomorrow afternoon. The con
test will be of great interest because
the result will afford. Bome means
of comparison with the University
of California team, which defeated
Pomona Thursday last by the score
of 90 pointß to 18. Since the meet
ing with California, the Pomona
team has been strengthened by the
addition of Cadwalader, a good
100-yard sprinter and low hurdler,
and of Moorman, a shot-putter and
hammer-thrower. The Pomona
men hope that these men may add
a few points to their side.
The track has become a little
hard in places,but is better than it
has been for severalweekson account
of the good weather of the past
week. Very fair time should be
made, for the best Stanford
men will be out. A few of
of the Stanford runners and jump
ers may not take part because of
sprains or temporary lameness.
A two-mile race will be run
during the afternoon which will
have no connection with the Po
mona contest. Those who will run
in this race will be Kinley, '06,
