# The 						Junior Prom.
## 
### 
Junior Day festivities were
brought to a close Friday evening,
March 20th, by the annual class
dance given at the Hotel Vendome
in San Jose. The eighty couples
who attended left the campus by
special train at 6:30 and returned
at 12:30. An excellent floor and
superb music made the program of
twenty-five dances most enjoyable.
The decorations consisted of long
strings of paper butterflies hung in
festoons from wall to wall.
Although the attendance was

much smaller than at Junior
dances of the past the affair was
unusually successful in every way
except financially.
