# VICTORY FOR CALIFORNIA.
## First Game in Baseball Series is Won by State University.—Score was 6 to 2. 
### 
California defeated Stanford in
the first baseball game of the inter
collegiate series last Saturday after
noon by the score of 6 to 2. The
Varsity played good ball through
out the game, and the result was in
doubt until the fifth inning. With
the score 2 to 2 California took the
lead, while Stanford was unable to
score again during the contest.
California won because Tritch
was unable to keep the hits scat
tered, and because Stanford failed
to hit when hits were most needed.
Once with three men on bases
and only one out the Varsity could
not get a man across the plate.
In fielding and base-running
Stanford showed up much better
than California, especially in the
early part of the game, when the
prospect of winning looked bright
for the Cardinal. Stanford's errors,
while one-half the number of Cali
fornia's, were costly and were di
rectly responsible for at least one
run. The California players, prob
ably on account of the large num
ber of new men on the team, were
nervous during the early part of
the game, and most of their errors
were made in the first few innings.
Toward the close of the game Cali
fornia fielded in perfect style. In
running the bases Stanford showed
considerable skill, and worried Cal
ifornia during the early part of the
game.
Heitmuller had the better of it
in the pitchers' battle and was
largely responsible for the victory
of his team. Especially when he
was in a tight place with men on
bases did the big California pitcher
prove effective. Heitmuller allowed
but seven hits and kept these well
scattered. Tritch pitched winning
ball at times, but of the eleven
hits he allowed two were made in
the fourth, three in the fifth, and
three in the seventh. In these
innings California scored five of
her six runs.
Wirt distinguished himself in
center field, accepting some difli
cult chances without an error,
while Ball behind the bat played a
fine game for Stanford.
California made the first run of
the game in the last of the first in
ning. Captain Adams of Califor
nia was given a base on balls, he
took second on Williams' error,
and scored on Graham's single.
Stanford scored her two runs in
the second and third innings. In
the second inning Colbert reached
second on a wild throw over first,
and scored on Swain's single. Ball,
in the third inning, reached first on
a single, Chalmers was given a
base on balls, advancing Ball to
second, and the latter scored on
Gillis' error of Adams' throw to
second. Stanford kept her lead
for only one inning.
California tied the score in the
fourth. Heitmuller reached third
on Sales' error of his single to right
field, and scored when Graham

again singled. California hit
safely three times in the fifth, scor
ing two runs, and repeated the per
formance in the seventh. Stanford
filled the bases in the ninth after
two men had been put out, but the
side was retired on Chalmers' fly to
left field.
The score:
CALIFORNIA.
