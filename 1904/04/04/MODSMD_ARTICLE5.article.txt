# Junior Farce Well Received.
## 
### 
"The Man from Mizzoury,'' pre
sented by the Class of 1905 on the
evening of March 24th, proved to
be a most successful entertainment.
Almost every scene was thoroughly
enjoyed by the exceptionally large
audience. The well-planned comic
situations of the play were cleverly
presented by the leading members
of the cast. The drill and chorus
by the "Ruble Guard " were prob
ably the best received features of
the farce. A few errors in execu
tion, due to the short space of time
which was allowed for preparation,
were not sufficiently noticeable to
seriously affect the play.
The stage settings, made especial
ly for the occasion, were appro
priate and well arranged. The cast
earned praise for itself by the very
natural manner in which college
life was portrayed in the play. E.
It. May, '06, in the leading comic
part, deserves especial mention for
his clever work. C. H. Baker, '04,
as " EHsystreet " was also excellent.
A. L. Trowbridge, '05, R. G. Bar
nett, '05, Miss M.de Luna, '05, and
H. I). Wheeler, '05, carried out
their parts in a very creditable
manner. Among the several musi
cal numbers " The Man from Miz
zoury" march was best received.
