The most discouraging thing in
the world to face is defeat, and the
baseball game last Saturday, has
left us face to face with this. But
we need not be discouraged, for
while we still have a chance to win
the series we have not been de
feated. We need not be downcast
over our showing last Saturday, for
the team played a good game, one
that under ordinary circumstances
would have gained a victory.
California won the first game and
will come down here next Saturday
confident of winning the second.
We want to be on the field just as
confident of disappointing her.
There is a week for practice, and if
the men work well and are sup
ported they can win the next game.
They will work hard, even harder
than they have been working
throughout the past weeks of the
season, and when the second game
is playetl jf determination and
Bpirit can accomplish anything we
can feel confident of turning the
tables on our opponents. It is to
be hoped that the student body will
be behind the team every minute
until a Stanford victory next Sat
urday has been assured.
