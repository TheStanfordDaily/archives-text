DO YOU KNOW
That the most wonderful
part of the world is
California?
Your friends in the East do not, in spite
of the long letters you write, describing the
delightful climate and beautiful places.
They wink the eye, and conclude that you
have learned "to draw the long bow." A
copy of
Sunset Magazine
sent them each month will carry conviction
and redeem your reputation for veracity.
It Is THE magazlneof California, â€”is devot
ed to California and things Californiau.
Every number is richly illustrated with
fine engravings of California views,
and every line in it, from the delicious
love story to the weighty article on scien
tific matters, is typical of California.
J lave you teen it t All the i newsstands keep
