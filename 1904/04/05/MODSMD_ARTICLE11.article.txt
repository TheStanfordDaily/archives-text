Several references have been
made in the columns of the Daily
Palo Alto to the necessity that
exists at Stanford for the election
of permanent class secretaries. In
every large and important college
in the United States each class,
immediately before graduation,
elects a permanent secretary whose
duty it is to keep the history of the
members of his class after gradua
tion. In the performance of this
duty, and in the performance of
the other functions of his office,
this secretary is a very powerful
factor in keeping the members of
the class in touch with one another
and with their alma mater. The
necessity for a similar officer in
Stanford classes is shown by the
fact that those who are trying to
secure the data for a new alumni
directory find themselves great
ly handicapped by being unable
to secure information from grad
uates individually. If each class
had a permanent secretary, not
only would the labor of compiling
such a directory be greatly simpli
fied, but class reunions during
commencement week and annual
class dinners would become real
ities instead of dim possibilities.
Surely no one doubts the value of
such reunions in keeping alive the
interest of an alumnus in his col
lege. The following editorial in
thfi Alumnus voices the disappoint
ment of the alumni over the failure
of 1904 to take some step in this
matter:
The Seniors have evidently dis
dained establishing a useful cus
tom, and it will remain for some
succeeding class possessed of a
more thoughtful regard for the
preservation of class records to
elect a permanent class secretary
and inaugurate a system that will
mean much in keeping up class
unity and providing a complete
and accurate record of Stanford
graduates.
It is to be hoped that a move
ment may be set on foot whereby

to the present Senior class may be
long the honor of instituting a
custom whose ultimate advent is
as inevitable as it is necessary and
desirable.
