# STANFORD WINS FROM POMONA.
## Varsity Track Team Inflicts Decisive Defeat on Southern Athletes by the Score of to 24½ 
### 
For the first time in the history
of the two colleges Stanford and
Pomona met on the track in an
intercollegiate contest. The visit
ing team put up a plucky fight,
her men forcing the Stanford run
ners to contest for every point.
The score compares favorably with
that made by the University of
California last week. Then Po
mona secured 18 points. Today
she secured points, with one
first place, four second places and
seven and one-half third places.
The 100-yard dash was the only
event in which Pomona took first
place. She took second in the 220
dash, the 440 dash, the high hur
dles and the low hurdles.
The results in some of the events
were very encouraging. In the
broad jump the Stanford record
was broken by both West and Hell,
who cleared 22 feet 2 4 inches. The
old record was Henley's, 21 feet 10
inches, made last year.
The 220-yard dash was run by
Duny in 0:22.1, but an examination
of the track showed that the dis
tance was 4 feet short. Later
Dunn tried for a record, paced by
three men, but could do no better
than 22.3, equaling the Stanford
record made by H. L. Hamilton in
1902.
Lanagan's work in the hurdles
was a great surprise and seems to
make him a big factor in the inter
collegiate meet. His time in the
high hurdles was 0:16.4, while
Hume of California made but
0:17.1 in the meet last Thursday.
In the low hurdles Hume's time was
0:28.1. MacFarland's work in the
low hurdles was also unexpectedly
good.
