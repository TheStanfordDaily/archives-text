# Concert by Schumann-Heinck.
## 
### 
There are still some good seats
left for the Schumann-Heinck con
cert. A part of the community
evidently does not realize what a
tine opportunity is being offered it
to hear one of the world's greatest
singers. It may he that there are
singers who surpass Schumann-
Heinck in delicacy of tone, there
may he some who are able to per
form greater marvels of vocal tech
nique, hut as an interpreter of the
songs of the greatest composers
there is hardly a single vocalist
who can claim to be her equal.
It is this that has given her a
unique position among the singers
of the world. Not only as a great
singer is she famous, but also as a
great personality, a woman of the
greatest intellectual as well as of
the greatest emotional and sympa
thetic capabilities. It is generally
conceded that no one has equalled
her in the interpretation of the role
of Ortrud in "Lohengrin," one of
the most humanly dramatic parts
ever conceived in the grand opera.
Her conception and portrayal of
the part is accepted as the ideal
one.
This, however, is only an iso
lated example of her achievements
on the music-drama and lyric
stages. Her high merit along
these lines won its due recognition
in the bestowal by Emperor Wil
liam in January last of the Medal
of Art and Science, a medal re
served for those who have won high
distinction in these fields.
Frau Schumann-Heinck,
her stay at the University, will
the guest of I)r. and Mrs. Moss
and Dr. and Mrs. Goebel in Palo
Alto. â€¢
