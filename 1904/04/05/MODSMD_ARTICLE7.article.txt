# RENTS WILL BE RAISED.
## Rental of Rooms in Both Dormitories Will Be Higher Next Year. 
### 
Ae a result of the action of the
Board of Trustees at its recent
meeting, the rent of rooms in both
Encina and Roble Halls will be in
creased at the beginning of next
semester. At the beginning of the
next college year (August, 1904)
occupants of double rooms will be
charged $0.00 each per month,
instead of $5.00 as at the present
time. Those occupying corner
rooms in Encina will be charged
$6.50 each instead of $5.50, and
those who occupy single rooms in
the men's dormitory must pay
$8.00 per month for the privilege
of rooming alone, instead of $7.00
as at the present time.
This action on the part' of the
Trustees is due to the increase in
the running expenses of the dormi
tories. Fuel and Bervant hire in
particular are much greater items
in the expense accounts than be
fore, so that as a step of sound
business policy the Trustees have
felt themselves called upon to make
this general increase in rents.
