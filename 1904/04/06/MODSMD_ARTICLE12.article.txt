Next Friday night Madame
Schumann-Heink will give a con
cert in Assembly Hall. Her repu
tation as a singer is world-wide,
and the community is to be
congratulated upon being given an
opportunity to hear her upon this
campus. A certain part of the
community, however, has accepted
such a rare treat too much as a
matter of course, has been oblivi
ous of the effort that was required
to secure Schumann-Heink, and
indifferent to the financial outcome
of the venture. In spite of the fact
that the concert can be nothing
less than the most brilliant artistic
achievement of the year at Stan
ford, a successful financial outcome
for the venture is by no means a
surety. The committee in charge
assumed a heavy responsibility in
its endeavors to bring a first-el:ti-s
artist to Stanford. Unless the com
munity meets the committee half
way and shows that it is interested
in first-class attractions, and will
support those who bring them here,
the outlook for the future is far from
bright. The committee can not
afford to get artists like Schumann-
Heink here at a financial loss. It
seems remarkable that every seat
in Assembly Hall was not sold
long ago, for to hear this renowned
singer in San Francisco would
require an outlay greatly in excess
of the very modest price asked for
seats at the coming concert. We
can not afford to let such an
attraction he anything but an un
qualified success. We must en
courage such things to come to
Stanford and evidence an interest in
them when- they do come. It will
be a slur upon our business sense
as much as upon the soundness of
our artistic judgment if there is a
single vacant seat in Assembly
Hall on the night of the concert.
