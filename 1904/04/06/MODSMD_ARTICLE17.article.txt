# Receives Ovation in San Francisco.
## 
### 
Madame Schumann-Heink, the
famous contralto, who will give a
concert in Assembly Hall next
Friday night, appeared at the Al
hambra Theatre in San Francisco
last night, where her first concert
was greeted with great enthusiam.
The San Francisco Chronicle paid
the following tribute to her art this
morning:
"All the homage paid to Mine.
Schumann-Heink when she ap
peared in this city during two
grand opera seasons was as nothing
compared to the ovation she re
ceived last evening at her initial
concert given in the Alhambra
Theatre. To hear this greatest of
the world's contraltos in opera is
something never to be forgotten,
but to hear her in concert is to
have one's soul stirred to its very
depths. In opera the tremendous
dramatic intensity of Mine. Schu
tnann-Heink's voice thrills as
does none other, but in concert one
gets all that, plus her marvelous
art, which is even more compelling
than her voice. The world does
not hold many singers who can
step without the harmonious setting
of opera and lose not one whit of
the dramatic charm that electrifies.
"After listening to Mine. Sehu
mtnn-Heink throughout a long
program last evening, one knew
that the intensity, the art, which
brought the world to her feet when
Bhe appealed in opera were not in
any way due to the accessories. It
was easy to see that the wonder of
it all was in the God-given voice
that is hers, and in the heart and
intelligence back of it.
"In opera Mine. Schumann-
Heink's voice never sounded such
depths as it did last night; in 1 Der
Wanderer,' by Schubert, she struck
a note that seemed past counting
and as musical and sweet and res
onant as if it had been sung out of
the perfection of an organ. In this
song she brought tears for the

heart-sick wanderer, and when, for
an encore, Mine. Schumann-
Heink sang ' Friihlingslied,' by
Becker, she 6ent every heart ring
ing with the irresistible joy of
spring.
" Tlie truth of the matter is that
in concert one conies in contact
with the personality, the immeas
urable temperament of Mine. Schu
mann-Heink. When she sings
songs that run the gamut of human
emotions and sweeps the audience
from heights to depths, one under
stands the honesty, the sincerity of
the singer. Mine. Schumanr.-
Heink is as great a woman as she
is a singer."
