### 
Homer Davenport, the famous
cartoonist who visited the Univer
sity recently, became especially
interested in the Museum, particu
larly in the memorial room and
the Stock Farm exhibits. As a
mark of interest in the collection
be has given to the Museum a
number of Samoan curios from his
private collection. There are six
large tappa cloths and eight native
hair combs in the gift. The combs
are of unique design, resembling in
form a rake, the row of fine teeth
being about an inch in width, and
the handle eight or ten inches in
length. The tappa cloths are ex
ceptionally fine specimens of the
old Samoan handicraft.
