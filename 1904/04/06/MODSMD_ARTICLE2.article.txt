# "QUAD" NOMINATIONS.
## Two Candidates for Editor and Two Nominees for Manager of Next Year's Annual. 
### 
The Sophomore class met today
in the chapel to nominate officers
for the '06 Quad. Four candidates
were named, two for editor and two
for manager. For editor, E. It.
May was nominated by W. H. B.
Fowler, and Miss C. M. Lathrop
by J. E. Campbell. For manager,
A. B. Cheadle was nominated by
L. R. Weintnann, and H.I. Cruzan
by W. H.Campbell.
The election will be held Wed
nesday, April 18th, on the quad,
the polls being open during the
usual hours for student body elec
tions, between 11:15 and 2:30. The
election board, appointed by the
president, is composed of the fol
lowing men: E. A. Cunha, C. M.
Hadley, J. E. Campbell, D. D.
Sales, and C. S. Osgood.
Owing to the fact that the treas
urer of the class last semester
issued no receipts and kept no
record of the assessments that were
paid at that time, the motion
passed at the last class meeting
that made eligibility for voting in
the present election dependent upon
the payment of these assessments
was rescinded. It was decided
to levy a new assessment of twenty
five cents, payment of which must
he made before members of the
class will bo allowed to vote at the
approaching election.
