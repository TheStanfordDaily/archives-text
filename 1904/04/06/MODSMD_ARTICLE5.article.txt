# CHESS TEAM SELECTED.
## Men Chosen Who Will Play California in San Francisco Friday Night. 
### 
The tournament which has been
carried on since the beginning of
the semester to determine Stan
ford's representatives in the an
nual intercollegiate chess match
came to a close yesterday. The
following seven men were chosen
for the team: R. A. Fuller, '05,
J. H. Page, '03, F. E. Ulrich, '06,
11. W. Strong, '06, A. B. Rhuart,'o4,
M. M. Stearns, '06, A. T. Parsons,
04. G. E. Dole, 07, is alter
nate. These players form one of
the strongest teams that Stanford
has ever had. Of the seven men
who will actually take part in the
match with California, Fuller,
Page, Ulrich, Strong and Parsons
are veterans of several years'stand
ing. Strong and Parsons both won
their games in the tie match that
was played with California last
year. Rhuart is an old California
varsity player, and is unquestion
ably the strongest man on the
team. A. T. Parsons will act as
captain.
California's team, as announced
early last week, will consist of the
following men: J. S. Lampson, '03,
J. L. Dobbins, '05, T. E. Stanton,
'03, E. H. Sawyer, '04, E. K.
Strong, '06, A. 1). Weitbrec, '05,
and R. L. Egenhoff, '07, with C. J.
Gibbs, '07, as substitute. Of these
players, Lam son, Dobbins and
Weitbrec participated in last year's
match, Lamson and Dobbins win
ning their games, and Weitbrec
playing a tie. T. E. Stanton has
been elected captain.
The intercollegiate match will be
played in the rooms of the Mechan
ics Institute Club, 14 Post street,
San Francisco, on Friday evening.
Play will begin promptly at 8.
The drawing will be held in the
morning in order to render delay
impossible. An effort is being
made to secure the services of
champion Pillsbury, who is at
present in San Francisco, as ref
eree, and it seems quite probable
that he will accept the invitation.
If Pillsbury finds it impossible to
officiate Dr. Lovegrove will be the
referee.
