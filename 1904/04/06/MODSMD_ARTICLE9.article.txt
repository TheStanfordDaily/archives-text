# DR. LYMAN ABBOTT SPEAKS
## Address on Knowledge and the Power Needed to Use It. 
### 
Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott, the
famous Presbyterian divine and
an editor of Outlook, spoke at the
student body Assembly this morn
ing before the largest audience
gathered at any of the Assemblies
since the first. Practically every
seat in the hall was filled, and
among the audience were a large
number of visitors. Before and
after the address there were songs
by the Glee Club and tbe audience.
Dr. Abbott was introduced by
President Jordan, and in bis open
ing remarks said he bad long de
sired to visit Stanford University.
His general subject was knowledge
and tbe power to use it.
" This question," he said, "is
one not inapplicable for an aca
demic audience, for there is not a
little danger that men. and women
coming to a great university will
have their thoughts too much di
rected to the intellectual aspect of
life. Knowledge alone is not
power; wisdom alone is not {tower.
Knowledge and wisdom are not
identical. In order to make
knowledge a power there must be
force to use that knowledge. In
tellect is not enough; there must
be a motive power to direct. It is
sometimes said that reason governs.
This is a mistake. Reason guides,
but does not govern. This motive
power governs.
" A simple proposition well put
by Huxley is the best definition of
education 1 know: 'Education is
the instruction of the intellect in
the laws of nature, and tbe fashion
ing of the will to move in harmony
with those laws. If it does not
harmonize it is not education.' If
you are to be educated you must
not only have knowledge, but you
must have the desire to move in
harmony with the laws of the uni
verse. Law is a force it) obedience
to us which we use in accomplish
ing our purposes. Thus we have
the laws of gravitation and of elec
tricity. Our success in dealing
with nature lies not in our knowl
edge of it, but in our spontaneous
obedience that enables us to make
its laws serve us. The laws of na
ture are unchangeable, and for
this reason we can make a multi
plicity of changes in applying
them. . We compel electricity to
obey us because we obey it.
"In the scientific world it is
necessary to live in harmony with
the laws of nature to be successful.
This is just as true in our individ
ual life. All of us violate the
laws of nature. We learn the laws
are irreversible and then submit.
We obey the laws, but we
could get rid of them. Then we
learn that if we live in harmony
with them we become strong and
