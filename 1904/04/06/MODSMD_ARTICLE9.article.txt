# DR. LYMAN ABBOTT SPEAKS
## Address on Knowledge and the Power Needed to Use It. 
### 
Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott, the
famous Presbyterian divine and
an editor of Outlook, spoke at the
student body Assembly this morn
ing before the largest audience
gathered at any of the Assemblies
since the first. Practically every
seat in the hall was filled, and
among the audience were a large
number of visitors. Before and
after the address there were songs
by the Glee Club and tbe audience.
Dr. Abbott was introduced by
President Jordan, and in bis open
ing remarks said he bad long de
sired to visit Stanford University.
His general subject was knowledge
and tbe power to use it.
" This question," he said, "is
one not inapplicable for an aca
demic audience, for there is not a
little danger that men. and women
coming to a great university will
have their thoughts too much di
rected to the intellectual aspect of
life. Knowledge alone is not
power; wisdom alone is not {tower.
Knowledge and wisdom are not
identical. In order to make
knowledge a power there must be
force to use that knowledge. In
tellect is not enough; there must
be a motive power to direct. It is
sometimes said that reason governs.
This is a mistake. Reason guides,
but does not govern. This motive
power governs.
" A simple proposition well put
by Huxley is the best definition of
education 1 know: 'Education is
the instruction of the intellect in
the laws of nature, and tbe fashion
ing of the will to move in harmony
with those laws. If it does not
harmonize it is not education.' If
you are to be educated you must
not only have knowledge, but you
must have the desire to move in
harmony with the laws of the uni
verse. Law is a force it) obedience
to us which we use in accomplish
ing our purposes. Thus we have
the laws of gravitation and of elec
tricity. Our success in dealing
with nature lies not in our knowl
edge of it, but in our spontaneous
obedience that enables us to make
its laws serve us. The laws of na
ture are unchangeable, and for
this reason we can make a multi
plicity of changes in applying
them. . We compel electricity to
obey us because we obey it.
"In the scientific world it is
necessary to live in harmony with
the laws of nature to be successful.
This is just as true in our individ
ual life. All of us violate the
laws of nature. We learn the laws
are irreversible and then submit.
We obey the laws, but we
could get rid of them. Then we
learn that if we live in harmony
with them we become strong and
vigorous. When a man under
stands the purposes of natural
laws he becomes a power. I can
give no better example than the
case of Theodore Roosevelt. As a
boy he was not strong, but he made
the laws of health his instruments,
and now he has been described as
4 a steam engine in breeches.' He
has done this not merely by under
standing the laws of nature, not
merely by obeying them, but by
making them his instrument.
" This is just as true of the soul
as of the body. We must under
stand the interrelationship of all
the elements of our being if we
would be men of power and of
force. Every element in the make
up of man is susceptible to two
uses. Conscience, reverence, affec
tion, faith, may exist in excess or
may be lacking, in the character of
man. Every quality is splendid if
well developed; the same quality
may be evil if stunted. Conscience
in excess has been responsible for
some of the greatest atrocities ever
perpetrated by mankind; misdi
rected reverence has caused man to
bow down and worship the dust of
the fields. Whether a quality is
base or noble depends in the main
upon its adjustment with the other
interdependent qualities.
"First we are under the law, and
then, a paradox, the laws are under
us. Congress cannot make a law
of morals any more than it can
make a law of physics. It finds
out what the law is, and then ad
justs the action of the nation to
this. We must find out what the
laws of nature are, and then, as
individual, as family, as state, live
in loving harmony with them.
This needs to be emphasized in
America, because it has not been
understood hitherto. Religion is
not something apart from life; it is
nothing but the art of living. One
part of a man cannot be educated
and another part left uneducated.
The training of the motive power
is what we call religion. What the
world wants' is accomplishments,
achievements, and for these 'force'
is necessary.
"Success in life will depend not
only upon obedience, but upon liv
ing in harmony with the law, what
ever its character. That is religion,
for religion is nothing else than
living in harmony with Cod.
Nothing more is possible; nothing
Ipsh iw adequate. Religion is a re
cognition of the great, divine laws
of nature, and an earnest living in
harmony with these laws. In that
lies the secret of life, and looking
back, one can say, '1 have lived my
life according to my light faithfully
and well.'"

Knowledge and wisdom are not
identical. In order to make
knowledge a power there must be
force to use that knowledge. In
tellect is not enough; there must
be a motive power to direct. It is
sometimes said that reason governs.
This is a mistake. Reason guides,
but does not govern. This motive
power governs.
" A simple proposition well put
by Huxley is the best definition of
education 1 know: 'Education is
the instruction of the intellect in
the laws of nature, and tbe fashion
ing of the will to move in harmony
with those laws. If it does not
harmonize it is not education.' If
you are to be educated you must
not only have knowledge, but you
must have the desire to move in
harmony with the laws of the uni
verse. Law is a force it) obedience
to us which we use in accomplish
ing our purposes. Thus we have
the laws of gravitation and of elec
tricity. Our success in dealing
with nature lies not in our knowl
edge of it, but in our spontaneous
obedience that enables us to make
its laws serve us. The laws of na
ture are unchangeable, and for
this reason we can make a multi
plicity of changes in applying
them. . We compel electricity to
obey us because we obey it.
"In the scientific world it is
necessary to live in harmony with
the laws of nature to be successful.
This is just as true in our individ
ual life. All of us violate the
laws of nature. We learn the laws
are irreversible and then submit.
We obey the laws, but we
could get rid of them. Then we
learn that if we live in harmony
with them we become strong and
vigorous. When a man under
stands the purposes of natural
laws he becomes a power. I can
give no better example than the
case of Theodore Roosevelt. As a
boy he was not strong, but he made
the laws of health his instruments,
and now he has been described as
4 a steam engine in breeches.' He
has done this not merely by under
standing the laws of nature, not
merely by obeying them, but by
making them his instrument.
" This is just as true of the soul
as of the body. We must under
stand the interrelationship of all
the elements of our being if we
would be men of power and of
force. Every element in the make
up of man is susceptible to two
uses. Conscience, reverence, affec
tion, faith, may exist in excess or
may be lacking, in the character of
man. Every quality is splendid if
well developed; the same quality
may be evil if stunted. Conscience
in excess has been responsible for
some of the greatest atrocities ever
perpetrated by mankind; misdi
rected reverence has caused man to
bow down and worship the dust of
the fields. Whether a quality is
base or noble depends in the main
upon its adjustment with the other
interdependent qualities.
"First we are under the law, and
then, a paradox, the laws are under
us. Congress cannot make a law
of morals any more than it can
make a law of physics. It finds
out what the law is, and then ad
justs the action of the nation to
this. We must find out what the
laws of nature are, and then, as
individual, as family, as state, live
in loving harmony with them.
This needs to be emphasized in
America, because it has not been
understood hitherto. Religion is
not something apart from life; it is
nothing but the art of living. One
part of a man cannot be educated
and another part left uneducated.
The training of the motive power
is what we call religion. What the
world wants' is accomplishments,
achievements, and for these 'force'
is necessary.
"Success in life will depend not
only upon obedience, but upon liv
ing in harmony with the law, what
ever its character. That is religion,
for religion is nothing else than
living in harmony with Cod.
Nothing more is possible; nothing
Ipsh iw adequate. Religion is a re
cognition of the great, divine laws
of nature, and an earnest living in
harmony with these laws. In that
lies the secret of life, and looking
back, one can say, '1 have lived my
life according to my light faithfully
and well.'"
Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott, the
famous Presbyterian divine and
an editor of Outlook, spoke at the
student body Assembly this morn
ing before the largest audience
gathered at any of the Assemblies
since the first. Practically every
seat in the hall was filled, and
among the audience were a large
number of visitors. Before and
after the address there were songs
by the Glee Club and tbe audience.
Dr. Abbott was introduced by
President Jordan, and in bis open
ing remarks said he bad long de
sired to visit Stanford University.
His general subject was knowledge
and tbe power to use it.
" This question," he said, "is
one not inapplicable for an aca
demic audience, for there is not a
little danger that men. and women
coming to a great university will
have their thoughts too much di
rected to the intellectual aspect of
life. Knowledge alone is not
power; wisdom alone is not {tower.
Knowledge and wisdom are not

knowledge a power there must be
force to use that knowledge. In
