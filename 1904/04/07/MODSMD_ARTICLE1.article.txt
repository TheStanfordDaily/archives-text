Many of the numbers which will

by Madame Schumann-Heink re
cently in San Francisco, where she
has given several concerts. Ashton
Stevens, the dramatic critic, in a
recent issue of the Examiner spoke
of her concert at the Alhambra
Theatre in the following terms:
"Not even Sembrich, with her
birdy lightness of tone, sings with
less effort in the old embroidery
operas than does Schumann-Heink
in the songs of Schubert and Schu
mann; nor has Sembrich concert
manners that are more wholesomely
captivating. Schumann - Heink,
big, plain, clean and genial, accepts
her plaudits with the grace of
goodfellowship. She smiles at
them, she even laughs, and a
schoolboy could not he more in
genuous ig his laughter. About
Schumann-Heink there is none of
the stuffed dignity of the prima
donna; and 1 don't believe that in
any of the many languages she
sings in she knows what the word
condescension means. When she
accepts an encore, it is with an air
that says, 'Thank you; and believe
me, the pleasure is all mine.' "
