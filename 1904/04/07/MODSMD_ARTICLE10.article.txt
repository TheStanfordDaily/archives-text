Tomorrow in San Francisco the
Stanford chess team will play the
sixth intercollegiate match with
the representatives of California.
Chess belongs to which class of stu
dent hody activites which receives
little general attention and comes
far from exciting widespread inter
est. But our team this year has
practiced faithfully and as a result
will enter the contest with a good
chance of victory. The University
as a whole wishes the team success;
let those of us who find it possi
ble he present at the match to
encourage the Stanford players.
