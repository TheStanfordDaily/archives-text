### 
Miss Gail Laughlin, the noted
woman lawyer, lectured in the
chapel last night on "The Progress
of Government." She traced trie
growth of government from the
crude, early forms down to those
of the present day, showing the im
provement and advancement in
public institutions. In the course
of her lecture Miss Laughlin made
an urgent plea for the granting of
the franchise to the women of this
country.
Miss Laughlin, who is a member
of the National Association of Col
legiate Alumnae, was entertained
at a dinner at the Stanford Inn by
the local association. Impromptu
remarks were made by Miss Laugh
lin, Wellesley; Miss L. J. Martin,
Vassar; Mrs. O. L. Elliott, Cornell;
Miss E. C. Franklin, Kansas; Miss
B. Montgomery, Smith; and Miss
M. I. McCracken, Stanford. So
pleasant a time was spent that the
women of the facility suggested that
one evening a week be chosen when
it be understood that those who
dined in the small room at the Inn
would be sure of spending a social
hour with others from (he campus
or Palo Alto. Tuesday evening
was set apart for this purpose, and
the women expect that this evening
will develop into the meeting time
of an informal dining club.
