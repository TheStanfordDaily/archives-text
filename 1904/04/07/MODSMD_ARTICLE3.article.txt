# INTERCLASS TRACK MEET.
## Stanford Records May Be Broken in Field-day on the Oval Tomorrow Afternoon at 2:30. 
### 
The annual interclass field-day,
which was to have been held on
Junior Day, but was postponed on
account of rain, will take place-on
the oval tomorrow afternoon, be
ginning at 2:30. This will be the
last meet before the intercollegiate
field-day, a week from Saturday,
and on account of the class rivalry
and the emblems at stake the con
tests are expected to be interesting.
Most of the men are now in excel
lent condition, and some very good
time should be made. If the con
ditions are favorable, it is probable
that Dunn, '04, will attempt to
break the Stanford record of 0:51.2
in the 440-yard dash, made by E.
A. Smith, '03, two years ago. N. E.
Dole, '04, will be out again in the
pole-vault, and will probably try
to better his record of 12 feet
inch made in practice last month.
The performances in the broad
jump and in the hurdles will also
be watched with interest. There
will be a mile relay, four men
from each class competing. The
personnel of the teams has not yet
been made up.

The annual interclass field-day,
which was to have been held on
Junior Day, but was postponed on
account of rain, will take place-on
the oval tomorrow afternoon, be
ginning at 2:30. This will be the
last meet before the intercollegiate
field-day, a week from Saturday,
and on account of the class rivalry
and the emblems at stake the con
tests are expected to be interesting.
Most of the men are now in excel
lent condition, and some very good
time should be made. If the con
ditions are favorable, it is probable
that Dunn, '04, will attempt to
break the Stanford record of 0:51.2
in the 440-yard dash, made by E.
A. Smith, '03, two years ago. N. E.
Dole, '04, will be out again in the
pole-vault, and will probably try
to better his record of 12 feet
inch made in practice last month.
The performances in the broad
jump and in the hurdles will also
be watched with interest. There
will be a mile relay, four men
from each class competing. The
personnel of the teams has not yet
been made up.
