### 
The sixth annual intercollegiate
chess match will take place tomor
row evening in San Francisco in
the rooms of the Mechanics Li
brary, 14 Post street. The draw
ings will be held at 5 in the after
noon by Captain Parsons of Stan
ford and Captain Stanton of
California, so that there will be no
delay in starting the play at 8.
The members of the team will meet
at the 4:18 train tomorrow after
noon.
The team which Stanford enters
tomorrow stands an excellent
chance of winning, as it is unques
tionably the best that has heen
developed in some years. Of the
five previous matches, four were
California victories; last year's
match resulted in a tie.
Word has been received that
champion Pillsbtiry, who has an
engagement to play before the San
Francisco Chess Club Friday eve
ning, will be unable to act as ref
eree. Dr. Lovegrove, champion
chess player of the Pacific Coast,
will officiate in his place.
