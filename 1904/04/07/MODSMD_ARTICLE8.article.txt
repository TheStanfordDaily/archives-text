# ALUMNI DEFEATED.
## Varsity Wins by Score of 13 to 5. Sales and Tritch Both Tried in Box. 
### 
Good hitting at opportune times
in yesterday's game enabled the
Varsity to inflict a decisive defeat
on the Alumni players in the second
game of the series between the two
teams. The first game resulted in
an eleven-inning tie, the score be
ing Ito 1. The pitching of Sales
and the batting of the Varsity were
the features of the game. Sales
pitched the first five innings and
was in fine form, allowing no hits
and striking out three men. He
gave no base on balls. Tritch re
lieved him in the sixth, but did not
prove so effective.
The Varsity hit safely fifteen
times, obtaining eight of these off
Parker's delivery and seven off
Lanagan's. Williams batted in
great form, hitting safely five, times
out of six times at bat. Colbert
and Ball also hit the ball hard, the
former being credited with a three
base hit, a two-base hit and a
single.
TheVarsity scored five runs in
the second inning, on four hits, an
error, and a wild throw. After
this inning Stanford scored almost
at will.
The Alumni scored in the sixth
and ninth, both times on hits off
Tritch, ajded by errors of the
Stanford fielders.
Knight took Sales' place in right
field and played a good game.
It is probable that the personnel
of the Varsity in the second game
with California on Saturday will
be the same as in the first part of
yesterday's contest.
