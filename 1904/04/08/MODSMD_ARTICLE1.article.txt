# REGISTER OUT MONDAY.
## Comparison with Registration Figures of Last Year.â€”Conditions Governing "Specials." 
### 
The Register for 1903-04 has
just made its appearance from the
press of C. A. Murdock& Company,
San Francisco, and will be ready
for distribution Monday. There
are no noteworthy changes in form
or appearance, and the statement
of courses of instruction is mainly
a record of the current year's work,
incidentally including partial an
nouncements for next year. The
following variations and statistics
will be of interest:
The Board of Trustees, having
come into full exercise of its pow
ers under the Charter, is given in
its reorganized form, with Mrs.
Stanford a member and chairman
of the board. The standing com
mittees of the board are also in
cluded.
In the list of faculty and other
officers are given all student assist
ants who have anything to do with
the instruction or general adminis
tration of the University. The
recent promotions were not made
in time to be included in the Reg
ister.
The only change in the list of
entrance subjects is the addition of
Intermediate Spanish (one credit),
and the change in Mechanical
Drawing from a half credit to a
full credit. It is also provided that
special entrance examinations
(aside from those regularly adver
tised for January, May, and Aug
ust) will be granted only on pay
ment of a special fee. Some
changes have been made in the
matter of recommendations from
approved schools. Princeton and
Wisconsin have been added to the
list of universities whose prepara
tion will be accepted as covering all
requirements of this University
(Princeton for the A. IS. course, and
Wisconsin under the 14-unit
plan). Of most interest to Califor
nia schools is the waiving of sup
plementary tests in various subjects
when the school and subject are
accredited by the State University.
This now applies practically to all
subjects in the California list, with
the exception of English, Botany,
and Freehand Drawing. The plan
begun last year of granting one
credit in English Literature with
out the oral test is continued in a
slightly modified form. Hereafter
this will apply only to those who
have had four years of high school
English, and the examination for
the second credit in Literature will
cover the ground of both 17a and
176.
The penalty for late registration
has been made cumulative after the
first week, and registration of un
dergraduates is not to be permitted
later than one month after the be
ginning of instruction. It is also
provided that petitions to drop
courses of study will not be consid
ered during the last six weeks of
the semester.
The additional provision regard
ing special students is as follows
(p. 64): "A special student who
has completed one hundred and
fifty hours of university work, in-
