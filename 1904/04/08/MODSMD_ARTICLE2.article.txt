# SECOND INTERCOLLEGIATE GAME.
## Stanford Will Meet California in Baseball Saturday Afternoon.â€”Good Chance for Victory. 
### 
Stanford will meet California on
thecimpus diamond at 2:80 to
morrow in the second game of the
intercollegiate baseball series. The
Varsity has been practicing harder
than at any time this season dur
ing the last week. Should they
win tomorrow, the deciding game
of the series will be played in San
Francisco.
The team that faces California
tomorrow will be slightly changed
from the team of last Saturday.
Sales will do the pitching and
Knight will take the place in right
field that Sales played in the first
game. Sales has not pitched be
fore in an intercollegiate contest,
but last year he pitched well in the
preliminary games, and this sea
son he has made a very creditable
record. In the game with the
Alumni Wednesday he showed fine
form, and should prove effective
against the California batters.
Knight, who will take Sale#' plaee
in right field, played that position
on the 1902 Varsity. He has been
hitting the ball hard lately. The
rest of the men on the team will
play the same positions as in the
last game. The batting order will
probably be changed slightly.
Both California and Stanford
have played one game since their
last contest. California defeated
St. Mary's early in the week by
the score of 4 to 1. Both times
Stanford met St. Mary's early in
the season the Varsity was defeat
ed. Stanford's game during the
last week was with the Alumni,
which she defeated by the score of
13 to 5. California has not met
this Alumni team during the sea
son. On the showing made by the
team in the game with the Alumni
may be based the hopes of the
Cardinal in tomorrow's contest.
Not only was Sales' pitching of a
very high order, but the Varsity
hit the ball harder than at any
time during the season. At no
time during the game was it hard
for them to obtain hits off either
Parker's or Lanagan's delivery, and
they had fifteen to their credit at
the end of the game. Stanford's
baseball teams for several years
have been very weak in batting.
California won the game last Sat
urday on her batting, for Stanford
has the better fielding team. In the
first contest California hit safely
nearly twice as many times as did
Stanford, making a total of eleven
hits while Stanford made but six.
California had the advantage of
playing on her own grounds in the
first game. This advantage will be
with Stanford tomorrow. The
Varsity will have another slight
advantage, as they will bat against
Heitmuller for the second time,
while the California batters will
face a new pitcher with a different
style of delivery. On the other
hand, Stanford had a slight ad
vantage over the California team
during the first few innings of the

last game that she will not have
tomorrow. Last Saturday the
California team seemed nervous
on account of the large number of
new men on her team, and her
many errors during the first few
innings were largely due to this.
The men tomorrow should have
more confidence in themselves ow
ing to the result of the last game,
and they will probably field well
from the start.
No umpire has been selected for
the game up to the present time,
but Managers Cowden and Decoto
will decide upon someone today. It
is improbable that Rube Levy, who
officiated last Saturday, will um
pire again tomorrow.
