# SENIORS WIN MEET.
## 1904 Takes Championship in Interclass Field Meet.—Hyde Breaks Record in Shot-Put. 
### 
The Class of 1904 won the an
nual interclass field-day thin after
noon by taking nearly twice as
many points as the other three
classes combined. The track was
too hard for good time to be made,
but the events were hard fought
and the finishes close and exciting.
Dunn ran a pretty race in the
quarter mile and came within one
second of equaling the Stanford
record of 0:51.2 held by E. A.
Smith, '03. O. E. Hyde, '04, broke
his last year's record in the shot-put
by one foot. In both the broad jump
and the high jump the winners
came within a fraction of equaling
the existing Stanford records. The
most exciting finish of the meet
was in the two-mile run, Powers,
'07, beating Burr, '05, by a very
small margin. Dole unfortunately
broke bis pole, at the same time
coming within an ace of breaking
the record in the pole-vault. The
Seniors won a lotal of 77 points,
the J unioi s 23, the .Sophomores and
the Freshmen tying with 13 each.
