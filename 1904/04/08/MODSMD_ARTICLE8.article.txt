Last Saturday our baseball team
played the first game in the inter
collegiate series on the California
campus at Berkeley and was de
feated. Tomorrow afternoon on
our own campus the second game
will be played. California is con
fident of victory, depending on the
strength of a nine that has once
defeated us. But we are confident
of victory, depending on the spirit
of men who work harder against
odds than when things are in their
favor. We feel that we will win
because, first of all, the team has
the winning spirit, because this has
been backed up by the hardest
kind of work during the past week,
because the whole University will
be on the stands to encourage the
men by their presence and by their
applause. A victory tomorrow
means everything for us, for with
out it we will have no opportunity
to break the string of California
victories in baseball that is already
too long. The team will do its
best, and there is a general feeling
that its best, will be enough. We
will do our best by supporting the
team from the first inning until
the last, and the team and college
will work together with mutual
pride.
