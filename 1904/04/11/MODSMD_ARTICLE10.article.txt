### 
The first singles tournament,
which was begun last Wednesday,
came to an end Saturday morning.
In the match before the last,
Hodge, '06, met Cassell, '07. This
furnished the closest contest of the
tournament, Hodge finally winning
out by the following scores: 6-3,
3-6, 6-0. After the match Hodge
met R. Lieb, '04, and by defeating
him 6-0, 6-0, won the first tourn
ament.
The second singles tournament
was begun Saturday morning, and,
owing to the fact that several play
ers defaulted, the final contest took
place Saturday afternoon. Hooper,
'05, beat F. Leib, '02, in the final
match by the scores of 6-4, 6-0.
This leaves Hodge, '06, and Hoop
er, '05, to meet Baker, '04, in a
round-robin tournament to decide
upon the two men who will repre
sent Stanford in the intercollegiate
singles.
The drawings for the doubles
tournament were held on the court
this afternoon and resulted as fol
lows: F. Leib, '02, and R. Leib,
'04, vs. Swinerton, '05, and Guyer,
'06. Hodge, '06, and Baker, '04,
vs. Hooper, '05, and Cassell, '07.
Burr, '06, and Bradley, '04, bye.
The doubles tournament will be
begun this afternoon.
