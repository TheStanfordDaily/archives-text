# Schumann-Heink Well Received.
## 
### 
Madame Schumann-Heink's re
cital Friday evening was attended
by one of the largest audiences
that has been seen in Assembly
Hall this year. A special train
from San Jose brought a number
of people from neighboring towns,
and the University community,
pratically in a body, took advan
tage of the rare opportunity offord
ed by the concert.
There was no lack of apprecia
tion in the reception given the
great contralto. Every number on
the program was greeted with
round after round of applause, and
the genial manner of the singer
won the good will of the audience
in as great degree as did her voice
win their appreciation. The con
cert of Friday night will be remem
bered as the greatest musical treat
to which the residents of the Uni
versity have listened during the
present college year.
The entertainment closed the
series of chamber concerts for
which the faculty music committee
arranged. From a financial stand
point the season has ended most
successfully. The receipts from
Friday's concert not only covered
nil expenses for that entertainment
but netted more than enough
money to pay off a previous in
debted ness.
