### 
The Japanese Students' Associa
tion of the University has invited
Dr. U. C. Harris of San Francisco
to lecture in the chapel Thursday
evening on the Russian-Japanese
war. Dr. Harris is now regarded
as one of the leading exponents of
Japanese ideas on the Pacific Coast.
He spent ten years in missionary
work in Japan, and for a number
of years represented - the United
States as consul at Hakodate,
Japan. In 1886 Dr. Harris re
turned to this country, and since
that time lie has been working
among the Japanese on this Coast
and in the Hawaiian Islands. His
knowledge of the present Japanese
situation is thorough, and his lec
ture promises to be of great interest.
