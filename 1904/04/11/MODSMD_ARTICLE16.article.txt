Rabbi Voorsanger, who was to
have preached in Memorial Church
Sunday, was unable to be present.
Chaplain Gardner preached in
stead, taking for his text Romans
viii, 28: "We know that all things
work together for good to them
that love God, to them who are
the called according to his pur
pose." Dr. Gardner sought to sub
stantiate the theory of Divine
providence by the evidence of
Christian and Jewish beliefs, of
confirmation by science, and of
confidence and faith in enlightened
peoples.
