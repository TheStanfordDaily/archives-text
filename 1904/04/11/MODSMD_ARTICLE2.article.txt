# STANFORD WINS SECOND GAME.
## California Defeated 6 to 2.—Fine Work of Battery and Timely Batting of Knight Features of the Contest. 
### 
Stanford defeated California in
the second baseball game of the
intercollegiate series on Saturday
by the score of 6 to 2. The Varsity
led from the first inning to the
end of the game, but the result
remained in doubt until Stanford,
in the ninth, gained a lead that it
was impossible for California 'to
overcome. Both teams played er
ratic ball at times, and California
hit safely more often than did
Stanford, but the Cardinal hits
came together and resulted, in al
most every instance, in runs.
The feature of the game was the
fine hitting of Knight, who was
largely responsible for the Stanford
victory. He hit safely three times,
a three-base hit, a two-bagger, and
a single. Besides crossing the plate
twice himself, he brought in three
runs by his heavy batting. Sales,
who pitched in an intercollegiate
game for the first time, handled
himself like a veteran, and was
especially effective at critical stages.
Although Heitmuller allowed one
less hit than Sales, the latter
showed much better control, giving
but one base on balls and striking
out five men. Captain Ball han
dled some difficult fouls in fine
style.
For California, Heitmuller pitch
ed fine ball except in the first two
innings and in the ninth. Several
tim6s he showed splendid form and
pulled his team out of several bad
places. The poor support given
the California pitcher was responsi
ble for two of Stanford's runs.

California took the field and
Stanford went to bat for the first
inning. Knight was the first man
up and on the second pitched ball
he knocked a long drive over
second base into deep center field,
reaching third base. The large
crowd of Stanford rooters went
wild with enthusiasm. Williams,
the next man up, was put out on a
high fly to third base; but Captain
Ball hit safely for two bases, and
Knight scored the first run of the
game. Chalmers reached first on
an infield hit that just tipped
Iieitmuller's glove, Ball going to
third. It looked as though Stan
ford would score again, only one
man being out, but Ball and
Chalmers tried to work the double
steal, and Ball was thrown out at
the plate. Chalmers reached
second. Wirt singled, advancing
Chalmers to third, and it looked
like another run for the Cardinal,
but Sales went out on a fly, retir
ing the side.
California in her half of the first
inning succeeded in getting a man
on third base after two outs had
been made, but Heitmuller made
the third out on any easy ground
ball to Sales; and Stanford came to
the bat for the second inning.
Heitmuller was wild at the be
ginning of the second inning, and
after Colbert had been put out by
a fly ball, he gave Swain a base on
balls and hit Trowbridge. With
two men on bases, Knight came to
the bat for the second time. He
again hit safely, scoring Swain and
Trowbridge. Stanford did not score
again until the ninth.
Heitmuller and the California
team settled down after the second
inning, and Stanford failed to in
crease her lead. For three innings
the Stanford men went out in one,
two, three order.
California failed to score until
the seventh inning, when the
Stanford team became rattled
and the Blue and Gold
scored its tsvo runs. Bliss for Cal
ifornia reached first on a single.
Wulzen knocked a high fly to
Chalmers, who made a bad muff,
and before he could recover the
ball Bliss had reached third. He
scored 011 Chalmers' poor throw
from the field. Sales caught the
throw and tried to catch Wulzen at
second but threw wide of that base,
and Wulzen scored before Wirt
could get the ball. Stanford
braced and ended the inning with
a fast double play.
In the eighth California came
within an ace of tying the score,
but Salefs pitched fine ball and
Adams was left on third base.
Stanford scored three runs in her
half of the ninth. Swain hit to
right field. Trowbridge sacrificed,
advancing Swain to second. Knight
hit safely past short, scoring Swain
and landing on second himself.
Williams reached first on Gillis'
error, Knight advancing to third.
Knight scored on Hamilton's error
of Ball's easy fly, Williams going
to second. On a passed ball by
Bliss, Williams advanced to third
and Ball to second. Hamilton
dropped another fiy from Chalmers'
bat and Williams scored, Ball going
to third, Chalmers to second. Wirt
was given a base on balls, but with
the bases full, Sales knocked a fly
to center field which was thrown
quickly to second, making a double
play and ending the inning. Cali
fornia failed to get a player further
than third in her half of the ninth,
and the game ended with the score
fi to 2.
Stanford defeated California in
the second baseball game of the
intercollegiate series on Saturday
by the score of 6 to 2. The Varsity
led from the first inning to the
end of the game, but the result
remained in doubt until Stanford,
in the ninth, gained a lead that it
was impossible for California 'to
overcome. Both teams played er
ratic ball at times, and California
hit safely more often than did
Stanford, but the Cardinal hits
came together and resulted, in al
most every instance, in runs.
The feature of the game was the
fine hitting of Knight, who was
largely responsible for the Stanford
victory. He hit safely three times,
a three-base hit, a two-bagger, and
a single. Besides crossing the plate
twice himself, he brought in three
runs by his heavy batting. Sales,
who pitched in an intercollegiate
game for the first time, handled
himself like a veteran, and was
especially effective at critical stages.
Although Heitmuller allowed one
less hit than Sales, the latter
showed much better control, giving
but one base on balls and striking
out five men. Captain Ball han
dled some difficult fouls in fine
style.
For California, Heitmuller pitch
ed fine ball except in the first two
innings and in the ninth. Several
tim6s he showed splendid form and
pulled his team out of several bad
places. The poor support given
the California pitcher was responsi
ble for two of Stanford's runs.
