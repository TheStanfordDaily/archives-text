# HONORS EVEN IN CHESS.
## California Tied the Score After Stanford Had Gained a Wining Lead. 
### 
For the second consecutive time
Stanford and California played a
tie game in the annual intercolle
giate chess match. The contest
was held in San Francisco hist
Friday night at the rooms of the
Mechanics' Institute. Each team
won three games and drew one.
The result was disappointing in
the extreme to the Stanford play
ers, as they gained a winning lead
early in the contest, and would
have scored a clean-cut victory hut
for the unexpected failure of Ful
ler, the first-place man on the
team, and Parsons, the captain, to
win or draw their games.
The three men who won for
Stanford were H. W. Strong, '06,
A. B. Rhuart, '04, and M. M.
Stearns, '06. All three played in
excellent form, especially Strong.
He defeated J. S. Lameon, who
was supposed to he California's
best player. F. E. Ulrich, '06, hy
playing a good game against A. D.
Weitbrec, won the half point which
made the score a tie. The most
interesting game of the match was
that between J. H, Page, '03, and
Stanton,theCalifornia captain. The
game began at 9 Friday night, and
was so far from being completed at
midnight that it was thought best
to postpone it until Saturday
morning. In the morning Page
made a splendid up-hill fight, but
Stanton clinched the lead he had
made early in the game, and by
winning made the final score
to 3*.

A very small crowd was present
at the match, owing to the exhibi
tion given by champion Pillsbury
before the San Francisco Chess
Clul). President Ott of the Me
chanics' Institute Chess Club acted
as referee, lie stated after the
match that the play in this tour
nament was of a much higher order
than in the intercollegiate matches
of the last few years, in which he
has officiated.
