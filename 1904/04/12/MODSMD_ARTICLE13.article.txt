# Non-Supporting Athletics.

### 
The following account from the
Yale Alumni Weekly in regard to
raising money for the non-support
ing branches of athletics at Yale
gives a plan that is interesting in
connection with the recent intro
duction of boating as a sport at
Stanford.
"Collections from Yale under
graduates for the non-supporting
athletic teams have been more suc
cessful this year than in any year
since the new system was estab
lished in 1901. It will be remem
bered that before 1901 a good deal
of the money for the support of
certain Yale athletics came from
the freshman class. The demand
on the freshman pocketbook grew
to be so heavy that three years ago
the faculty said that freshmen
must not be asked to pay more
than their proper share. It was
then decided to collect eight dol
lars yearly from each man in the
university who was able to pay,
and the total, it was calculated,
would be sufficient to meet the
expenses of the non-supporting
athletic tea is, with the exception
of the crew, which would still have
some other assistance. The first
year this plan was tried the collec
tions were very poor. Instead of
reaching $9000, as it was hoped
they would, they fell below $5000.
Last year there was an improve
ment. lip to the Easter recess of
the present year, the collections
had gone somewhat over $0000.
For the first time the law and
medical schools have been brought
under a regular canvass, and from
each a considerable amount has
been raised. The athletic; sub
scription fund committee hopes
to raise the total of collections to
$7,500 or even $8,000.
"Some of the men approached for
their contribution of eight dollars
do not understand why, with such
a surplus left over from the foot
ball season, they should be asked
to contribute anything. It is
sometimes necessary to explain
that with the exception of baseball
and football Y'ale athletics are
non-supporting. It takes a very
large sum of money yearly to meet
the deficits of the crew, track,
hockey, basket-ball, golf, swim
ming, gymnastic and fencing
teams, and the expenses of keeping
up the Yale field and all its ath
letic equipment are so great that
even the football surplus rapidly
disappears. Subscriptions, there
fore, seem absolutely necessary
under the present conditions. No
man is urged to subscribe who is
not able to give the money."
