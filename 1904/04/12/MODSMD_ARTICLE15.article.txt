# The
						Luxurious Way.
## 
### 
Every Californian should go to
the St. Louis World's Fair.
Many will enjoy scenery through
plate glass windows, satisfy them
selves with sumptuous dining-car
meals, please their fancy with the
latest books from the train library,
go to bed by the electric berth
light at night, and exclaim at
journey's end:
"I've been the Luxurious Way;
I'll always travel Santa Fe."
