Pond'sExtraet is an everyday stand-by
among college students. They know
that it is a sovereign remedy for the
many accidents incidental to school
life. Pond's Extract—the old family
doctor—might with equal propriety be
called the old college doctor. For over
CO years Pond's Extract has been doing
a work of mercy—curing cuts, bruises,
burns; relieving aches and pains;
easing suffering, and making life
brighter. It is |ust as efficient to-day.
