Ax a meeting of the Senior class
today a committee was appointed
to investigate the system of elect
ing a permanent class secretary.
The step is one in the right direc
tion, and there is little doubt that
the committee will report in favor
of the suggestion that the present
Senior class be the first at Stanford
to inaugurate a custom that has
long been firmly established with
the finest results in the older col
leges of the East.
