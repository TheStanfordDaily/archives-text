Tomorrow night a rally for the
track men will be held in Assembly
Hall. The track men will be there,
the men who will compete in the
intercollegiate meet and win honor
for their college, and the ones who
have fallen short of the required
standard in spite of the most faith
ful training and burdensome Work.
These men will learn tomorrow
night of the pride and confidence
that the college places in them.
For perhaps the first time they
will find out that their long weeks
of training have been neither un
noticed nor unappreciated. And
tomorrow the whole college should
be present to show the men the
real position they occupy in our
hearts at the present time. We
feel that they will win next Satur
day, and we want them to know
that we place confidence in their
ability to keep the championship
that a Stanford team won for the
first time last year. We want to
cheer the trainer and the captain,
the old point winners and the ones
who will gain the big white "S"
for the first time next Saturday,
and above all we want to thank
the man who has worked hard but
unavailingly to be given a chance
to win a point for his college. He
can rest assured that he has helped
toward the victory as materially as
has the man who at the end of the
football season sits on the side
lines and watches the intercollogi
ate game.
