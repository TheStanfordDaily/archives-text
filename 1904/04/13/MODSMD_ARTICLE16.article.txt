### 
Dr. Ewald Fliigel, professor of
Philology, haB been granted leave
of absence for three years by the
Board of Trustees of the University.
During that time he will complete j
tlie Chaucer dictionary upon which
he has been engaged since 1890.
The work will be done under the
auspices of the Carnegie Institute
of Washington, 1). C., which has:
made liberal allowances for the
purchase of books and the copying J
of manuscripts. Provision is also:
made for the employment of four
assistants. Not all of these have j
been chosen, but one of them will
be Instructor E. K. Putnam of the
English department, who has been
granted a year's leave of absence.
Dr. Fliigel will do the greater
part of his work at his home in
Palo Alto and at the University.
Dr. Jordan has put at his disposal
rooms in the English building, and
his material will be collected here.
Dr. Fliigel, while doing no teaching
during the next years, will remain
at the head of the Philology depart
ment. Next year he will make a
trip to England and France to do
some work in the great libraries
there, but the greater part of the
necessary material he haw in his
own collection at Palo Alto. He
will be gone only during the sum
mer vacation. Two of Dr. Fliigel's
assistants will give University
courses in Philology, besides carry
ing on their work on the dictionary.
A Chaucer dictionary has never
been published, and the undertak
ing of Dr. Fliigel is of interest, to
scholars the world over. Dr. Flii
gel's grandfather published the
first complete English-German
dictionary, in 1830, a work which
was revised and enlarged by his
son in 1890. This is now the
standard English-German diction
ary.
