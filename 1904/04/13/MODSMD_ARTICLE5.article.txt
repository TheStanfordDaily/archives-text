# VARSITY VS. ST. MARY'S.
## Stanford Will Play the Oakland Team Tomorrow for Third Time This Season. 
### 
Stanford will play St. Mary's
College of Oakland on the campus
diamond tomorrow afternoon at
3:30. This will be the third time
these teams have met this season,
St. Mary's winning the two former
games by the scores of 9 to 4 and
4 to 3.
The St. Mary's team will consist
of the same men who played
against the Varsity in the last
game between the two teams. Cal
ifornia defeated this team last
week, and the Stanford victory last
Saturday makes the result of to
morrow's contest uncertain. The
Oakland team is one of the strong
est amateur nines on the Pacific
Coast, and it is generally conceded
to be better than Santa Clara this
season.
4 Ferguson will pitch again for
the visitors, and should hold the
Varsity down to but few hits.
Phelan, who injured his foot in the
first game against Stanford, will be
on third base, his old position.
The Stanford team will be prac
tically the same as the one that
defeated California last Saturday.
Sales will pitch the first half of the
game and Tritch will then take his
place. Roosevelt and Tritch pitched
the first game against St. Mary's,
and Tritch the second game.
The next practice game for the
Varsity will be on Saturday morn
ing, when the team of soldiers from
the Presidio will be their oppo
nents.
The personnel of the teams that
will play tomorrow follows:
