# Football Rules Will be Discussed.
## 
### 
There will be a meeting of the
Intercollegiate Football Rules Com
mittee in New York about the
middle of this month to discuss
certain changes in the rules for
next year. Among the important
things for decision will he the rule
calling for seven men in the line
when the attacking party is inside!
the twenty-five-yard line. This
seven-men rule was made at the
meeting of the rules committee a
year ago in response to requests
from the public for a more open
style of play, it was in the nature
of an experiment and it was hoped
would show which was the better
and safer style of play. As to its
effect opinions differed at the end
of the season. The advocates of
the rule claimed for it that its
adoption would give the faster and
lighter backs an opportunity. Ex
perience in many colleges was ex
actly to the contrary, and if the
rule of last year should be con
tinued or extended over the whole
field, the probabilities are that the
men found behind the line next
season would be very heavy line
breakers, the end-running game
having, apparently, become ineffec
tive against the modern defense
employed against it by a strong
team. The new rule has put a
premium on big men behind the
line, which many consider a great
injury to the game.
Another rule which will prob
ably be acted upon is that touching
the value of the goal from the field.
It is claimed b} r many that the
value given it now, five points, is
too great, and that it should be re
duced a point. Other minor points
of the game will be taken up at
this meeting, which promises to be
a lively one.
The rules committee is as fol
lows: Chairman, Paul J. Dashiel,
Annapolis and Lehigh; A. 1).
Wrenn, Harvard; Walter Camp,
Yale; Prof. J. B. Fine, Princeton;
J. C. Bell, University of Pennsyl
vania; Prof. L. M. Dennis, Cornell;
A. A. Stiigg, Chicago. Mr. Stagg's
name was added to the committee
only last week.
