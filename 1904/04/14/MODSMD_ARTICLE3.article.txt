# Beach's Condition Not Serious.
## 
### 
J. M. Beach, '04, whose hands
were injured by an explosion of
glass apparatus in the chemical
laboratory yesterday, will not be
prevented from entering the field
meet Saturday. He was unable to
practice yesterday afternoon, but
today he was able to begin vaulting
agiiin. Both his hands were
sprinkled with hue pieces of glass
and his left hand received two deep
cuts. He was attended by ])r.
Franklin of the Chemistry depart
ment, who succeeded in extracting
all the glass from his hand. With
proper care the soreness resulting
from the cuts should be gone by
Saturday, so that he will not be
seriously handicapped in his vault
ing.
As Beach has been depended
upon to take second place in the
pole-vault for Stanford in next
Saturday's meet, his injury, had it
been serious enough to keep him
out of the contest, would have been
a heavy handicap for the Cardinal
to offset.
