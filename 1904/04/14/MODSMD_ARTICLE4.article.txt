now liusy putting it in place.

stonework of the gymnasium will
be continued. This stonework in
now up to the second story all
around the building.
The first earth was turned on the
new gymnasium in 1902, The
foundations were put down without
delay, and the cornerstone was
laid with ceremonies early in 1803.
When the stonework had reached
the second story there was Home
trouble between the contractor and
the workmen, and a strike brought
the work to a stop. During this
strike an agreement was reached
between the contractor and the
University whereby the time for
the performance of the work was
extended six months. The large

work within a short time should
make rapid progress from now on.

however, a matter of several months.

completed it will lie equipped with
