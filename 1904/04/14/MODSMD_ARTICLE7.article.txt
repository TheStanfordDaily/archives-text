# "Sequoia" May Be a Monthly.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents last night an amendment to
the constitution of the student
body, authorizing the changing of
the Sequoia from a bi-weekly to a
monthly publication, was adopted.
The proposed amendment will
therefore be voted upon at the
coming meeting of the student
body. This action was taken by
the Executive Committee at the re
quest of the board of editors of the
Sequoia, who believed that the
change would be very beneficial to
the paper. Manager Thorpe re
ported that the finances and adver
tising of the Sequoia would not be
seriously affected, and upon this
showing the Executive Committee
decided to recommend the change.
The Sequoia was first published
in December. 1891, and during its
life of over twelve years it has ap
peared in various forms and at
different times as a bi-weekly and
weekly publication. Its conversion
into a monthly has often been
urged, but the suggestion has never
been carried into effect. All the
best eastern college magazines are
monthlies, and it is hoped now to
raise the standard of the Sequoia
to their level, both in the matter of
the reading contained and in the
manner -of printing. The paper
will be increased in size about two
thirds, and probably more illus
trations will be used.
