# DR. HARRIS SPEAKS IN CHAPEL.
## Former American Consul Tells of Questions at Present Agitating the Far East. 
### 
Dr. U. C. Harris, for a number
of years United States consul and
missionary in Japan, delivered an
interesting lecture this afternoon-in
the chapel. Dr. Harris' subject
was"The Russo-Japanese War
and Some Problems of the Far
East."
Dr. Harris began by stating that
he would give his own views on the
war problem as gathered from inti
mate association for a great many
years with the Japanese people.
He stated that the Russo-Japanese
war was an inevitable conflict that
had been coming on for thirty-five
years, owing to Russia's constant
reaching out for territory. When
he first went to Japan in 1851 he
settled in the northern part of the
country. Near the port he noticed
a Russian fort, and soon after he
was told that the Russians were
trying to gain a foothold in the
country. During all his stay in
Japan lie saw the people in con
stant unrest and fear of foreign
encroachment.
Three years ago Dr. Harris made
a trip through Japan, and every
where —at all vulnerable and
strategical points—he noticed vaHt
preparations for defense. To show
the causes of this movement Dr.
Harris related an incident which
happened during General Grant's
visit to Japan. When General
Grant noticed the encroachments
upon Japan by other powers he
was thoroughly aroused and ad
vised the emperor and the minis
ters to live at peace with their
neighbors, but to build themselves
strong within—to build an army
and a navy. Dr. Harris empha
sized the fact that this advice had
been closely followed.
The next point which Dr. Harris
brought out was the great love of
country displayed by the Japa
nese. He stated that if any people
had a right to enjoy their country
in peace and safety it was the
Japanese, because they had loved
their country sincerely and because
they had improved it both in
beauty and in value. Dr. Harris
showed that Japan's people were
not naturally fond of war but were
a nation that, after once being
aroused, would fight to the last.
He said that the average Japanese
soldier fought for the love of his
country and for his principles, and
not for the mere sake of fighting.
Dr. Harris also commented upon
the respect the Japanese soldiers
have for women.
In regard to the conspiracy
against China, Dr. Harris de
nounced the encroachments of
Russia, Germany, and France.
He stated that the stand taken by
the United States and England
was highly commendable, and
would be confirmed by any for
eigner who had been in the East.
Dr. Harris then spoke of the be
ginning of the war. He said that
Japan sought peace on an honor
able basis, but could come to no
agreement with Russia. The Jap
anese government held out for
peace as long as possible, but the

people forced the declaration of
war.
In cloning, Dr. Harris discussed
the probable length of (he war. He
stated that Japon will figbt until
she is in a position to enjoy repose,
and have an opportunity for devel
opment. He spoke of the great
work being done in educational
lines in Japan, and showed lhat
when permanent safety was estab
lished the improvement would be
more rapid. Dr. Harris stated
that the Japanese were fighting for
a noble cause, and that all Ameri
cans who have ever lived in Japan
and studied the situation are
in sympathy with the Japanese
cause.
