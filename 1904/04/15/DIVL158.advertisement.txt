School
Days
are sometimes filled with suffering. The
strenuous life of the average student
brings its series of mishaps. Pond's
Extract—the old /amity doctor—offers
quick relief and cure for all such ills.
The student who has a bottle of Pond's
Extract at hand is well provided to re
lieve pain and suffering. It cures cuts,
bruises, burns; stops bleeding; re.
lieves earache, toothache, rheuma
tism and all pains as if by magic.
Soothes and freshens the face after
shaving. For over 60 years it has
been the one family remedy that
has never disappointed.
Watered Witch Hazel,
a weak solution—some
times offered in pluce
of Pond's Extract—has
no medicinal value—is
positively worthless.
Pond's Extract CURES
—therefore is priceless.
Sold only in sealed bottles
under buff wrapper,
ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTE.
