The Varsity defeated St. Mary's
yesterday by the close score of 3 to
2. Sales and Tritch pitched for
the Varsity, the former going into
the game during the first six in
nings, and holding the visitors
down to one hit. Ferguson,
the St. Mary's pitcher, had great
speed, and as a result most of the
balls the Varsity hit went up in
the air. Stanford scored twice in
the second and once in the third
inning, while the two runs made
by St. Mary's came in the seventh.
This is the third time Stanford has
playetl St. Mary's, the Oakland
team having won the first two
games.
