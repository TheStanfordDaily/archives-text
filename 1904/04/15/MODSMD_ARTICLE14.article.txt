During many years the date of
the annual track meet between
Stanford and California was wel
comed by those at the State Uni
versity as a day of sure victory,
while Stanford men tried only to
develop a team that would make a
creditable showing against the
rivals they had grown to regard as
invincible. Last year Stanford
won the track meet for the first
time in her history, and this she
did in the face of overwhelming
discouragements and unlooked for
reverse's. Tomorrow we meet Cal
ifornia again. We have a team of
which every one of us is proud, —
proud with a feeling of confidence
in men who will never acknowledge
defeat. We are confident of our
team, not because it is a collection
of record-breaking performers, but
because every man who will con
test is working for Stanford, not
for himself; because every one of
them is waiting for a chance to
eink his own ambition in the cause
that is loved by us all. There is
no need to ask Stanford men to
rally behind the team: one who
has followed the sacrifices, the hard
work, the patient self-denial of
these men, could not be kept from
cheering them to the victory which
will be the merited reward of their
devotion. There is a cheer today
for the trainer and the captain who
have directed the work of the men,
and next week there should he a
rally for the team, every member
of it, from the man who set the
pace to the man who broke the
tape first and won five points for
the Cardinal.
