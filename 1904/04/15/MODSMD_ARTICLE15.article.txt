With a record of three consecu
tive victories behind thern the ten
nis teiitn of California will play
Baker and Hodge on the courts to
morrow morning. It is useless to
deny that California has a team
which is generally conceded to he

stronger than our own, but the
thought of the fight that our play
ers showed in last year's tourna
ment — when they met their antag
onists without practice or condition
because they had had no courts
upon which to play —makes us re
member, that whatever the critics
may say, a Stanford team is never
beaten until the last play has been
executed. We will play on our
own courts tomorrow, and our men
will receive encouragement where
last year they received only a
faltering cheer from the handful
of Stanford men who witnessed the
tournament. We can be sure of
seeing a hard-fought contest, and
there will be a crowd there to give
the Stanford yell when the men
are fighting for the match.
