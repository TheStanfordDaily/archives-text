Everything will be in readiness
for the intercollegiate track meet
on the oval tomorrow afternoon at
2:30. The track has been very
carefully rolled and scraped, until
it is in better condition than it has
been for years. Every part of it
has been carefully gone over and
every small defect remedied. The
rain that has fallen has been too
light even to soften the track,
which would have been beneficial,
for in places it is a little hard. It
would require a heavier rainfall
than is threatened to do any seri
ous harm. Bleachers are being
erected which will seat nearly 2000
people. A tent will be erected
somewhere on the oval to serve as
rubbing quarters for the Califor
nians.
The Stanford men practically
finished their hard work of train
ing last night. Today those who
went out on the track merely
warmed up. There will be no fur
ther work until the final struggle
tomorrow afternoon. With one or
two exceptions, every man on the
team is in excellent form. Barrett,
'04, one of the best two-mile men,
has been troubled with a bad
ankle for weeks and has been un
able to do proper training, but he
will run tomorrow, and his grit
may make him a factor in the race.
All the other sprains and ills have
been practically cured, and the
team as a whole has been in far
better luck than was the case last
year.
Captain Holman and Trainer
Moulton express the greatest confi
dence in the ability of the Cardi
nal men to win. A conservative
estimate, which concedes to Cali
fornia many doubtful points, and
counts for Stanford those about
which reasonable certainty may be
felt, gives to the Cardinal a total
of 68 points, to 54 for the Blue and
Gold. In many cases where Stan
ford seems to have an excellent
chance of taking first place, as in
the hurdles, second only is claimed.
In the 100-yard dash first place
is conceded to Abadie of California.
II. L. Hamilton of Stanford and
Snedigar of California have a hard
fight between them for the other
two places. Hamilton has a shade
the better prospect.
Dunn, S., is conceded first place
in the 220-yard dash by both sides.
In this event, too, Hamilton and
Snedigar will contest —and Hamil
ton ought to win out —for second
place.
'The 440-yard dash will go to
Dunn, S., with Crossman, S., a
close second. It will he a light be
tween Russell, S., and Kern, C.,
for third place. Carter, S., and
Wilcox, ()., are good men in this
event.
Holman, S., seems to have a
good chance for the half-mile, with
Bounds, S., a likely man for second
place. California expects Clifford,
who won second place last year,
and Edwards, to win points in the
race.
Both sides seem to figure on
winning the mile. Holman won
for Stanford last year in 4:41, and
is in excellent form this year, but
Hackley and Lyon of California
have been doing well, and their
college looks to them to defeat
Holman. They will have to reckon
with Gay of Stanford also, however.
It is expected that Gay will run
close to Holman.
The two-mile race is an unknown
quantity. California figures upon
Tibbetts and Hackley for first and
second places. What the Stanford
men can do is problematical, al
though some of them may prove
surprises. Barrett would he a like
ly man for first if in shape. Pow
ers has been doing very well, and
Gay, Burr, and Morin may take
something. Stanford expects to
get at least one point out of the
event.
In the high hurdles Lanagan has
done belter than any of the pub
lished times of California, and in
the low hurdles Lanagan and Mac-
Farland have beaten the printed
California times.
The high jump is given to Cap
tain Cooley of California, but Bell
and Dole will make him earn it.
Hickey of California is not believed
to be in form.
In the broad jump Bell and
West are depended upon to take
the first and second places, al
though California claims that
Chaplin will beat them both.
Chaplin has an academic record of j
22 feet 6A inches.
Dole and Beach are expected to
take first and second in the pole
vault. Bell may not enter this
contest.
Captain Holman believes that
C. E. Hyde should win the shot
put, despite California's claims for
Sperry. Hyde can do over 44 feet
at a pinch, while Sperry's best pub
lished distance is 43 feet 6 inches.
Crawford has a chance for third
place.
Crawford is expected to beat
Sperry in the hammer-throw. He

lias thrown the hammer as far as
149 feet in practice, while Sperry's
published distance is 148 feet.
The relay isconceded to Stanford
with her excellent 440-yard men.
The officials for the field-day will
he as follows: Iteferee, John El
liott; starter, L. Carey; timers,
Colonel George C. Edwards, It. H.
Smith, Dr. Thomas A. Storey, A.
Norton, and Dr. Frank Angell;
judges at finish, Prof. A. W. Smith,
George Klaarman, and E. Dye";
inspectors, Anthony Cadogan, A.

field judges, J. T. Nourse, F. L.

Make, R. Itoos; clerk of the course,
It. R. Long; assistant clerk, W. A.

Sperry. Hyde can do over 44 feet
at a pinch, while Sperry's best pub

Crawford has a chance for third
place.
Crawford is expected to beat
Sperry in the hammer-throw. He

Everything will be in readiness
for the intercollegiate track meet
on the oval tomorrow afternoon at
2:30. The track has been very
carefully rolled and scraped, until
it is in better condition than it has
been for years. Every part of it
has been carefully gone over and
every small defect remedied. The
rain that has fallen has been too
light even to soften the track,
which would have been beneficial,
for in places it is a little hard. It
would require a heavier rainfall
than is threatened to do any seri
ous harm. Bleachers are being
erected which will seat nearly 2000
people. A tent will be erected
somewhere on the oval to serve as
rubbing quarters for the Califor
nians.
The Stanford men practically
finished their hard work of train
ing last night. Today those who
went out on the track merely
warmed up. There will be no fur
ther work until the final struggle
tomorrow afternoon. With one or
two exceptions, every man on the
team is in excellent form. Barrett,
'04, one of the best two-mile men,
has been troubled with a bad
ankle for weeks and has been un
able to do proper training, but he
will run tomorrow, and his grit
may make him a factor in the race.
All the other sprains and ills have
been practically cured, and the
team as a whole has been in far
better luck than was the case last
year.
Captain Holman and Trainer
Moulton express the greatest confi
dence in the ability of the Cardi
nal men to win. A conservative
estimate, which concedes to Cali
fornia many doubtful points, and
counts for Stanford those about
which reasonable certainty may be
felt, gives to the Cardinal a total
of 68 points, to 54 for the Blue and
Gold. In many cases where Stan
ford seems to have an excellent
chance of taking first place, as in
the hurdles, second only is claimed.
In the 100-yard dash first place
is conceded to Abadie of California.
II. L. Hamilton of Stanford and
Snedigar of California have a hard
fight between them for the other
two places. Hamilton has a shade
the better prospect.
Dunn, S., is conceded first place
in the 220-yard dash by both sides.
In this event, too, Hamilton and
Snedigar will contest —and Hamil
ton ought to win out —for second
place.
'The 440-yard dash will go to
Dunn, S., with Crossman, S., a
close second. It will he a light be
tween Russell, S., and Kern, C.,
for third place. Carter, S., and
Wilcox, ()., are good men in this
event.
Holman, S., seems to have a
good chance for the half-mile, with
Bounds, S., a likely man for second
place. California expects Clifford,
who won second place last year,
and Edwards, to win points in the
race.
Both sides seem to figure on
winning the mile. Holman won
for Stanford last year in 4:41, and
is in excellent form this year, but
Hackley and Lyon of California
have been doing well, and their
college looks to them to defeat
Holman. They will have to reckon
with Gay of Stanford also, however.
It is expected that Gay will run
close to Holman.
The two-mile race is an unknown
quantity. California figures upon
Tibbetts and Hackley for first and
second places. What the Stanford
men can do is problematical, al
though some of them may prove
surprises. Barrett would he a like
ly man for first if in shape. Pow
ers has been doing very well, and
Gay, Burr, and Morin may take
something. Stanford expects to
get at least one point out of the
event.
In the high hurdles Lanagan has
done belter than any of the pub
lished times of California, and in
the low hurdles Lanagan and Mac-
Farland have beaten the printed
California times.
The high jump is given to Cap
tain Cooley of California, but Bell
and Dole will make him earn it.
Hickey of California is not believed
to be in form.
In the broad jump Bell and
West are depended upon to take
the first and second places, al
though California claims that
Chaplin will beat them both.
Chaplin has an academic record of j
22 feet 6A inches.
Dole and Beach are expected to
take first and second in the pole
vault. Bell may not enter this
contest.
