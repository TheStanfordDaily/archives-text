Everything will be in readiness
for the intercollegiate track meet
on the oval tomorrow afternoon at
2:30. The track has been very
carefully rolled and scraped, until
it is in better condition than it has
been for years. Every part of it
has been carefully gone over and
every small defect remedied. The
rain that has fallen has been too
light even to soften the track,
which would have been beneficial,
for in places it is a little hard. It
would require a heavier rainfall
than is threatened to do any seri
ous harm. Bleachers are being
erected which will seat nearly 2000
people. A tent will be erected
somewhere on the oval to serve as
rubbing quarters for the Califor
nians.
The Stanford men practically
finished their hard work of train
ing last night. Today those who
went out on the track merely
warmed up. There will be no fur
ther work until the final struggle
tomorrow afternoon. With one or
two exceptions, every man on the
team is in excellent form. Barrett,
'04, one of the best two-mile men,
has been troubled with a bad
ankle for weeks and has been un
able to do proper training, but he
will run tomorrow, and his grit
may make him a factor in the race.
All the other sprains and ills have
been practically cured, and the
team as a whole has been in far
better luck than was the case last
year.
Captain Holman and Trainer
Moulton express the greatest confi
dence in the ability of the Cardi
nal men to win. A conservative
estimate, which concedes to Cali
fornia many doubtful points, and
counts for Stanford those about
which reasonable certainty may be
felt, gives to the Cardinal a total
of 68 points, to 54 for the Blue and
Gold. In many cases where Stan
ford seems to have an excellent
chance of taking first place, as in
the hurdles, second only is claimed.
In the 100-yard dash first place
is conceded to Abadie of California.
II. L. Hamilton of Stanford and
Snedigar of California have a hard
fight between them for the other
two places. Hamilton has a shade
the better prospect.
Dunn, S., is conceded first place
in the 220-yard dash by both sides.
In this event, too, Hamilton and
Snedigar will contest â€”and Hamil
