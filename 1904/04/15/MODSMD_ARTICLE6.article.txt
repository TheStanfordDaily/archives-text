Tomorrow morning the tennis
team will meet the University of
California players in the thirteenth
intercollegiate tennis contest. The
chances of victory this year are
good, in spite of the fact that the
rainy weather has greatly inter
fered with practice. Hodge and
Baker, who will represent Stanford
in hoth doubles and singles, can be
depended on to play a strong game.
On the California tennis team
will be Drummond MacGavin, who
has played in the last three inter
collegiate contests, H. F. Variel,
who played in the doubles last
year, and Neil Baker, a new man,
who is well known on account of
his playing in tournaments held
in San Francisco. This is a strong
team, and the Stanford men will
have to play good tennis in order
to win the contest.
Hodge, who will meet MacGavin,
is a heady player and has shown
up well in practice. He has never
taken part in an intercollegiate
contest, but has shown himself to
be cool and certain. MacGavin is
a capable, experienced man, and is
easily the best player on the Cali
fornia team.
Cleveland Baker will face Cali
fornia's new man, Neil Baker, who
is a comparatively inexperienced
player. Baker is a seasoned tourna
ment player, who has shown him
self to be cool and gritty when
playing an important match. He
plays a very shrewd game, and, as
lie will confront a strong man, the
match ought to furnish an exciting
contest. Should Stanford manage to
win one of the singles matches, her
chance of winning the doubles and
the tournament is good.
The tournament will be begun at
9 tomorrow morning on the Encina
courts. The referee and linesmen
will be selected tomorrow.
