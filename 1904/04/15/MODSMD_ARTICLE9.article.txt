# COMBINED CONCERT AT NIGHT.
## Musical Clubs of California and Stanford Will Give Performance in Assembly Hall. 
### 
The musical clubs of Stanford
and California will give a com
bined concert in Assembly Hall
tomorrow night at 8. The program
which will be rendered contains
several familiar numbers, and some
that are new to Stanford audi
ences. The performance should be
first-class in every particular, as
the Stanford organizations are up
to the average, and the California
clubs are so good that they will be
sent to St. Louis next summer.
