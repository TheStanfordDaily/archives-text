The twelfth annual intercollegi
ate field-day between Stanford and
the University of California, held
Saturday, resulted in an easy vic
tory for the Cardinal, the score
being 69 to 53. Bad weather
marred the day to some extent, but
it did not prevent some record
breaking performances. Most re
markable of these was the work of
O. E. Hyde, '04, who broke the
United States intercollegiate record
in the shot-put by sending the ball
45 feet 6A inches, which is 10
inches better than the record of
Beck of Yale. In the pole-vault,
N. E. Dole, '04, set a new Coast
mark of 11 feet 8$ inches, improv
ing his record of last year by one
inch. In the two-mile run, Hack
ley of California reduced Tibbetts'
record of 10:29, which stood as the
Coast intercollegiate record, to
10:21 4-5. Tibbetts came in only a
few feet behind Hackley. The 100-
yard dash was run in the Coast
record time of 10 seconds flat, be
ing won by Abadie of California.

Stanford took ten out of fourteen
first places, and two Stanford men
tied with a California man for first
place in the high jump. California
took first only in the 100-yard

dash, the two-mile run, and the
relay race, with the division on the
high jump. Stanford got three
second places, to California's nine.
In third place Stanford had four
men, to California's eight. Three
Stanford men each took two firsts
—Dunn the 220-yard and 440-yard
dashes, Holman the half-mile and

mile runs, and Lanagan the low
and high hurdles. The Stanford
men who won sweaters for the first
time are Lanagan, '04, West, '06,
and MacFarland, '07. Forty-nine
points were made by '04 men, 12
hy '05, 5 by '06, and 3 by '07.
The mile run, the first event on
the program, was one of the closest
fought of the day. It was a hard
| sprint for 100 yards up the home
' stretch, Holman leading at the fin
ish by one yard, with Hackley and
| Newhall fighting hard. Gay of
Stanford finished about two yards
behind Newhall. Holman took
the half-mile in another hard race.
In the final of the 100-yard dash
were Abadie and Snedigar of Cali
fornia and Hamilton and Bubb of
Stanford. Although it was run in
10 flat, Snedigar came in almost
abreast of Abadie, and two yards
ahead of Hamilton.
The work of Lanagan in the
hurdles was among the finest of the
day and caused the wildest enthu
siasm among the Cardinal sup
porters. Lanagan has an easy,
clean-cut style of hurdling, and
was decidedly the superior of the
California men. In the low hur
dles MacFarland, '07, easily won
second place. The work of Ball,
'06, indicated that he will probably
develop into a first-class hurdler.
Although a new man at the sticks,
he won out in the first heat over
Meany and Hume in 0:16.4.

The most disappointing features
of the day from the Stanford point
of view were the 440-yard dash and
the relay. In the 440 Stanford ex
pected Dunn to take first and Cross
man second. It was an easy race for
Dunn, who loitered all the way up
the last 75 yards, but Crossman
did not run up to his usual form
and did not make a place, Kern
and Wilcox coming in ahead of
him. The relay went to California
for the first time since the race was
inaugurated. The first pair were
Carter of Stanford and Adler of
California. Carter came in with a
lead of two yards and sent Russell
speeding on the second lap. How
ard, the next California man, how
ever, closed up the gap and finished
about six yards ahead of Russell.
Thomas of California increased
this lead to about twenty yards
over Bounds. The final lap was
run by Kern of California and
Crossman of Stanford. For a few
seconds it looked as though Cross
man might compel California's
new quarter-miler to fight hard for
first place, but the handicap was
too great, and he could do no more
than lessen the gap to a few yards.
He ran a game race, but the odds
were too heavy.
In the two-mile run occurred the
only disagreeable feature of the
day. The attempts of the Califor
nia men to hold back Powers of
Stanford were quite noticeable, and
resulted finally in the spiking of
the Stanford runner in the knee.

In the sixth lap Powers fainted
from the pain and was carried from
the track. The work of L. G. Burr,
'05, in this event was unexpectedly
fine. Burr fought hard until final
ly beaten out for third place in the

last 220 yard*, and was so worn
out that he was unable to finish.
In the hammer-throw none of
the men were up to form, Crawford
winning at 183 feel 5-f inches over
Sperry by the narrow margin of
of an inch. In the shot-putting
the only good work was that of
Hyde, who established a new Amer

ican intercollegiate record. Sperry
could do no better than 39 feet
inches, two other California men
beating him.
The results in the jumps were a
surprise to Stanford. In the high
! jump first place had been conceded
to Cooley of California, but he had
to divide first honors with Dole
and Hell of Stanford, both of whom
equalled his jump of 5 feet 11
inches. In the broad jump not a
California man got a place, though
none of the Stanford men per
formed as well at the meet as they
I have done in practice.
Dole's attempt to set a new
world's record in the pole-vault
held the big crowd long after all
! the other events were finished. He
cleared the bar readily at 11 feet
8-f inches, better by an inch than
' his record last year, which stood
as the Coast record, but he was
unable to go over with the bar at
12 feet 112 inch in an attempt to
lower the world's record.

few feet behind Hackley. The 100-
yard dash was run in the Coast
record time of 10 seconds flat, be
ing won by Abadie of California.

Stanford took ten out of fourteen
first places, and two Stanford men
tied with a California man for first
place in the high jump. California
took first only in the 100-yard

dash, the two-mile run, and the
relay race, with the division on the
high jump. Stanford got three
second places, to California's nine.
In third place Stanford had four
men, to California's eight. Three
Stanford men each took two firsts
—Dunn the 220-yard and 440-yard
dashes, Holman the half-mile and

mile runs, and Lanagan the low
and high hurdles. The Stanford
men who won sweaters for the first
time are Lanagan, '04, West, '06,
and MacFarland, '07. Forty-nine
points were made by '04 men, 12
hy '05, 5 by '06, and 3 by '07.
The mile run, the first event on
the program, was one of the closest
fought of the day. It was a hard
| sprint for 100 yards up the home
' stretch, Holman leading at the fin
ish by one yard, with Hackley and
| Newhall fighting hard. Gay of
Stanford finished about two yards
behind Newhall. Holman took
the half-mile in another hard race.
In the final of the 100-yard dash
were Abadie and Snedigar of Cali
fornia and Hamilton and Bubb of
Stanford. Although it was run in
10 flat, Snedigar came in almost
abreast of Abadie, and two yards
ahead of Hamilton.
The work of Lanagan in the
hurdles was among the finest of the
day and caused the wildest enthu
siasm among the Cardinal sup
porters. Lanagan has an easy,
clean-cut style of hurdling, and
was decidedly the superior of the
California men. In the low hur
dles MacFarland, '07, easily won
second place. The work of Ball,
'06, indicated that he will probably
develop into a first-class hurdler.
Although a new man at the sticks,
he won out in the first heat over
Meany and Hume in 0:16.4.

The most disappointing features
of the day from the Stanford point
of view were the 440-yard dash and
the relay. In the 440 Stanford ex
pected Dunn to take first and Cross
man second. It was an easy race for
Dunn, who loitered all the way up
the last 75 yards, but Crossman
did not run up to his usual form
and did not make a place, Kern
and Wilcox coming in ahead of
him. The relay went to California
for the first time since the race was
inaugurated. The first pair were
Carter of Stanford and Adler of
California. Carter came in with a
lead of two yards and sent Russell
speeding on the second lap. How
ard, the next California man, how
ever, closed up the gap and finished
about six yards ahead of Russell.
Thomas of California increased
this lead to about twenty yards
over Bounds. The final lap was
run by Kern of California and
Crossman of Stanford. For a few
seconds it looked as though Cross
man might compel California's
new quarter-miler to fight hard for
first place, but the handicap was
too great, and he could do no more
than lessen the gap to a few yards.
He ran a game race, but the odds
were too heavy.
In the two-mile run occurred the
only disagreeable feature of the
day. The attempts of the Califor
nia men to hold back Powers of
Stanford were quite noticeable, and
resulted finally in the spiking of
the Stanford runner in the knee.

In the sixth lap Powers fainted
from the pain and was carried from
the track. The work of L. G. Burr,
'05, in this event was unexpectedly
fine. Burr fought hard until final
ly beaten out for third place in the

last 220 yard*, and was so worn
out that he was unable to finish.
In the hammer-throw none of
the men were up to form, Crawford
winning at 183 feel 5-f inches over
Sperry by the narrow margin of
of an inch. In the shot-putting
the only good work was that of
Hyde, who established a new Amer

ican intercollegiate record. Sperry
could do no better than 39 feet
inches, two other California men
beating him.
The results in the jumps were a
surprise to Stanford. In the high
! jump first place had been conceded
to Cooley of California, but he had
to divide first honors with Dole
and Hell of Stanford, both of whom
equalled his jump of 5 feet 11
inches. In the broad jump not a
California man got a place, though
none of the Stanford men per
formed as well at the meet as they
I have done in practice.
Dole's attempt to set a new
world's record in the pole-vault
held the big crowd long after all
! the other events were finished. He
cleared the bar readily at 11 feet
8-f inches, better by an inch than
' his record last year, which stood
as the Coast record, but he was
unable to go over with the bar at
12 feet 112 inch in an attempt to
lower the world's record.

The twelfth annual intercollegi

Saturday, resulted in an easy vic

being 69 to 53. Bad weather
marred the day to some extent, but
it did not prevent some record

O. E. Hyde, '04, who broke the
United States intercollegiate record
in the shot-put by sending the ball
45 feet 6A inches, which is 10

fornia and Hamilton and Bubb of
Stanford. Although it was run in
10 flat, Snedigar came in almost
abreast of Abadie, and two yards
ahead of Hamilton.
The work of Lanagan in the
hurdles was among the finest of the
day and caused the wildest enthu
siasm among the Cardinal sup
porters. Lanagan has an easy,
clean-cut style of hurdling, and
was decidedly the superior of the
California men. In the low hur
dles MacFarland, '07, easily won
second place. The work of Ball,
'06, indicated that he will probably
develop into a first-class hurdler.
Although a new man at the sticks,
he won out in the first heat over
Meany and Hume in 0:16.4.

The most disappointing features
of the day from the Stanford point
of view were the 440-yard dash and
the relay. In the 440 Stanford ex
pected Dunn to take first and Cross
man second. It was an easy race for
Dunn, who loitered all the way up
the last 75 yards, but Crossman
did not run up to his usual form
and did not make a place, Kern
and Wilcox coming in ahead of
him. The relay went to California
for the first time since the race was
inaugurated. The first pair were
Carter of Stanford and Adler of
California. Carter came in with a
lead of two yards and sent Russell
speeding on the second lap. How
ard, the next California man, how
ever, closed up the gap and finished
about six yards ahead of Russell.
Thomas of California increased
this lead to about twenty yards
over Bounds. The final lap was
run by Kern of California and
Crossman of Stanford. For a few
seconds it looked as though Cross
man might compel California's
new quarter-miler to fight hard for
first place, but the handicap was
too great, and he could do no more
than lessen the gap to a few yards.
He ran a game race, but the odds
were too heavy.
In the two-mile run occurred the
only disagreeable feature of the
day. The attempts of the Califor
nia men to hold back Powers of
Stanford were quite noticeable, and
resulted finally in the spiking of
the Stanford runner in the knee.

In the sixth lap Powers fainted
from the pain and was carried from
the track. The work of L. G. Burr,
'05, in this event was unexpectedly
fine. Burr fought hard until final
ly beaten out for third place in the

last 220 yard*, and was so worn
out that he was unable to finish.
In the hammer-throw none of
the men were up to form, Crawford
winning at 183 feel 5-f inches over
Sperry by the narrow margin of
of an inch. In the shot-putting
the only good work was that of
Hyde, who established a new Amer

ican intercollegiate record. Sperry
could do no better than 39 feet
inches, two other California men
beating him.
The results in the jumps were a
surprise to Stanford. In the high
! jump first place had been conceded
to Cooley of California, but he had
to divide first honors with Dole
and Hell of Stanford, both of whom
equalled his jump of 5 feet 11
inches. In the broad jump not a
California man got a place, though
none of the Stanford men per
formed as well at the meet as they
I have done in practice.
Dole's attempt to set a new
world's record in the pole-vault
held the big crowd long after all
! the other events were finished. He
cleared the bar readily at 11 feet
8-f inches, better by an inch than
' his record last year, which stood
as the Coast record, but he was
unable to go over with the bar at
12 feet 112 inch in an attempt to
lower the world's record.

The twelfth annual intercollegi
ate field-day between Stanford and
the University of California, held
Saturday, resulted in an easy vic
tory for the Cardinal, the score
being 69 to 53. Bad weather
marred the day to some extent, but
it did not prevent some record
breaking performances. Most re
markable of these was the work of
O. E. Hyde, '04, who broke the
United States intercollegiate record
in the shot-put by sending the ball
45 feet 6A inches, which is 10
inches better than the record of
Beck of Yale. In the pole-vault,
N. E. Dole, '04, set a new Coast
mark of 11 feet 8$ inches, improv
ing his record of last year by one
inch. In the two-mile run, Hack
ley of California reduced Tibbetts'
record of 10:29, which stood as the
Coast intercollegiate record, to
10:21 4-5. Tibbetts came in only a
few feet behind Hackley. The 100-
yard dash was run in the Coast
record time of 10 seconds flat, be
ing won by Abadie of California.

Stanford took ten out of fourteen
first places, and two Stanford men
tied with a California man for first
place in the high jump. California
took first only in the 100-yard

dash, the two-mile run, and the
relay race, with the division on the
high jump. Stanford got three
second places, to California's nine.
In third place Stanford had four
men, to California's eight. Three
Stanford men each took two firsts
—Dunn the 220-yard and 440-yard
dashes, Holman the half-mile and

mile runs, and Lanagan the low
and high hurdles. The Stanford
men who won sweaters for the first
time are Lanagan, '04, West, '06,
and MacFarland, '07. Forty-nine
points were made by '04 men, 12
hy '05, 5 by '06, and 3 by '07.
The mile run, the first event on
the program, was one of the closest
fought of the day. It was a hard
| sprint for 100 yards up the home
' stretch, Holman leading at the fin
ish by one yard, with Hackley and
| Newhall fighting hard. Gay of
Stanford finished about two yards
behind Newhall. Holman took
the half-mile in another hard race.
In the final of the 100-yard dash
were Abadie and Snedigar of Cali
fornia and Hamilton and Bubb of
Stanford. Although it was run in
10 flat, Snedigar came in almost
abreast of Abadie, and two yards
ahead of Hamilton.
The work of Lanagan in the
hurdles was among the finest of the
day and caused the wildest enthu
