# CALIFORNIA WINS TENNIS.
## Hodge and Baker Defeated in Singles. â€”Doubles Postponed on Account of Rain. 
### 
After a closely contested tourna
ment the California tennis team
won the thirteenth intercollegiate
tennis contest. The Stanford play
ers were defeated in both singles
matches, and although the doubles
have not yet been finished, a vic
tory for Stanford in this match
would not change the final result.
An enthusiastic crowd of about
three hundred witnessed the tour
nament, and every good play was
loudly applauded.
The first match was between
Drummond McGavin, the veteran
tennis player of California and
George Hodge, a new man in inter
collegiate tennis. Hodge although
defeated made a creditable showing
and proved himself to be a man
who, with more practice and ex
perience, will develop into a strong
player. MacGavin, as was ex
pected, played a fine game, and
won by the score of 6-3, 6-2.
The most exciting match of the
day was when C. H. Baker of Stan
ford faced Neil Baker of California.
This match was warmly contested,
the California man finally winning
by the score of 13-11, 6-4. Nearly
every game was close, there being
only two love games in the entire
first set. Throughout the first set
the lead was constantly changing
from one to the other of the players
until the score stood ten all, when
the California man braced and
allowed C. H. Baker only one
more game. The final score of the
set was 13-11. In the second set
of the match Neil Baker played
much stronger and won handily by
the score of 6-4. This ended the
singles matches and gave Califor
nia the championship.
The doubles contest,which prom
ised to be the most exciting match
of the day, was interrupted by the
rain. When the play was stopped
the score was 5-5. MacGavin and
Variel, the veteran California
players, were expected to defeat
Baker and Hodge easily, but the
Stanford men played fast tennis
and it was only the great work of
MacGavin that prevented the rep
resentatives of the Blue and Gold
from being defeated. The match
will probably be finished next Sat
urday, but the time and place have
not yet been definitely decided
upon.
