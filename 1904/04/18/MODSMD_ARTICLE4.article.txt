An alumnus who, with eyes
shining, was watching the field
meet last Saturday, said, as Stan
ford clinched her victory by taking
three places in the broad jump,
"You fellows know how to run the
college nowadays; in my time, I
would have thought the world coin
ing to an end if Stanford had won a
track meet." He was right—as far
as track athletics are concerned.
The men who have been in charge
of the track candidates the past
two years have known how to run
their particular branch of the col
lege, and run it successfully. Stan
ford has been blessed with a first
class trainer, and she has had two
captains who have worked hand in
hand with him. She has had a
track team of hard-working, un
complaining, self-sacrificing ath
letes, and these men have brought
her victory twice. She is proud of
these men and their leaders, for
they are of the right kind. Stan
ford men throughout the country
feel a just pride in the men who
won the meet Saturday, and we are
all full of love for those who have
been working for years to lay the
foundations of a victorious team.
