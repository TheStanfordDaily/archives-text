Rabbi Voorsanger of the Temple
Emanu-El, San Francisco, spoke
in Memorial Church Sunday morn
ing. The text was from Isaiah
xliii, 10: "Ye are my witnesses,
saith the Lord, and my servant
whom I have chosen." Rabbi
Voorsanger traced the growth of
the divine idea among men, show
ing the great difference in the pres
ent conception of God as compared
with that of primitive times. Of
all the deities of the earlier nations
the God of the Hebrews, through
whom He chose to manifest Him
self, has gradually become univer
sally accepted, until now He is
worshipped by fourteen hundred
millions of people, in one form or
another.
