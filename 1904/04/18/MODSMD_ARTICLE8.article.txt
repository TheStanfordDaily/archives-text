# Stanford Defeats Presidio.
## 
### 
Stanford defeated the crack base
ball team from the Presidio Satur
day morning by the score of 3 to 1.
The contest was the best game of
the season, the Varsity playing
without an error, while Tritch
allowed but three bits. This is
only the second time the Presidio
team has been defeated this season,
while it has won over forty games.
Both teams scored their only
runs of the game in the first inning.
Stanford was first at bat and scored
three times on two hits and some
bad errors. In the last of the first
the soldiers got one man across the
plate. The first man up for the
visitors singled, stole second and
scored on a single to left field.
After the preliminary inning
both pitchers settled down, and
their teams gave them perfect sup
port. Forsythe, who pitched for
Presidio, struck out nine men and
allowed but five bits. Tritch also
proved a puzzle to the heavy bat
ters of the Presidio nine. But
seven innings were played as the
Presidio team arrived on the cam
pus an hour late.
The batteries of the teams were:
Stanford —Tritch and Ball; Pre
sidio —Forsythe and Conrad.
The next game will probably take
place Wednesday afternoon with St.
Mary's at Idora Park in Oakland,
where the third intercollegiate
game will be played.
