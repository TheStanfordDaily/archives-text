# ASSEMBLY HELD YESTERDAY
## Alfred W. Cooley Speaks to Student Body on Civil Service Commission. 
### 
At the University Assembly
which was held yesterday afternoon
at 3:30, the principal speaker was
Alfred \V. Cooley, a member of the
United States Civil Service Com
mission. He took as his subject
the work of the commission, and
gave a short history of the civil
service from its beginning. He
discussed the manner of making
appointments under the "spoils"
system. By this method men se
cured positions simply through
political jobbery, or because they
were friends of legislators. As a
result the offices were often occu
pied by men utterly incompetent to
fill them. This not only resulted
in lowering the efficiency of the de
partments, but tended to lessen the
dignity of public office-holding
The United States civil service
law, which was passed in 1883, was
distinctly an American statute in
principle. It provided that public
positions must be obtained solely
on personal merit, to be tested in a
competitive examination. The offi
cers who were formerly in the ser
vice only while their friends held
political sway, were now assured of
their position during good behavior.
As a result, the efficiency of the de
partments was developed and the
dignity of office-holding was en
hanced. The passage of this law
was brought about through the
force of public opinion, attendant
upon the assassination of President
Garfield by a disappointed office
seeker.
In showing the character of the
civil service office, Cooley used as
an illustration the railway mail
service. The candidate for a clerk
ship in this branch must pass a
rigid examination, and be espec
ially well acquainted with the ge
ography of the United States. The
mail which is gathered at the vari
ous stations must be sorted on the
train, and to do this the clerk
mußt know the names and geo
graphical location of from £ten to
twelve thousand offices. This de
partment of the service was classi
fied in 1889, resulting in increased
efficiency in the mail clerks.
"It is claimed by many, 1 ' said
Mr. Cooley, " that the civil service
laws create an office-holding class."
This was shown to add to the effi
ciency of departmental servants,
because, on account of the few
removals, the operators become
expert. In regard to the system
which governs removals, Mr.
Cooley showed its businesslike
character. Any person who is rec
ommended for removal from office
is given a chance to defend him
self. He is notified in regard to
the nature of the charges against
him, and given time to make a
reply. This affords protection
against the system of arbitrary re
moval which was the custom sev
eral years ago.
