# Varsity May Play at Oakland.
## 
### 
If the grounds at Idora Park,
Oakland, are dry enough to play
upon, in all probability Stanford
will meet the nine of St. Mary's
College at Oakland tomorrow
afternoon. Arrangements for a
game had practically been com
pleted by the student body treas
urer, but this afternoon word was
received that the grounds were too
wet to play upon. If the rain stops
and the grounds dry by tomorrow
morning the team will make the
trip to Oakland in the afternoon.
The game should be valuable in
accustoming the Stanford players
to the grounds on which the third
intercollegiate contest with Califor
nia will be played next Saturday.
The personnel of the teams will
be unchanged. The line-up follows:
