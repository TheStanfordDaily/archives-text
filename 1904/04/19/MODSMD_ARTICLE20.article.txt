# Pitcher's Box Being Raised.
## 
### 
Workmen are at present engaged
in changing the elevation of the
pitcher's box on the campus dia
mond. The box will be raised in
height eighteen inches. This change
will be made in order that the
Stanford men may familiarize
themselves with the peculiarities of
playing ball on a diamond of this
nature. The diamond at Idora
Park, Oakland, where the third
game in the intercollegiate series
will be played, is equipped with a
raised pitcher's box, and the change
would prove a decided handicap to
the work of the Stanford players
both at the bat and in the field if
they were not given an opportunity
to practice on a field of this kind.
