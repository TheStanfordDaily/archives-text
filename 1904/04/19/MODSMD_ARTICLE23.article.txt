# Stanford Club May Have Rooms.
## 
### 
J. F. English, '01, the newly
elected president of the San Fran
cisco Stanford Club, has appointed
a committee consisting of W. R.
Knowles, '96, A. B. Rice, '95, and
W. H. Irwin, '99, to look into the
matter of permanent rooms for the
club in San Francisco. After going
over the ground very thoroughly,
the committee has decided to ap
point a larger committee, which
will hold a meeting in a few weeks,
and receive a detailed report on all
conditions. At that time it will be
decided whether the Stanford Club
is in a position to establish itself
iii permanent quarters.
The University of California
club-house, which was opened two
weeks ago, has proved a success,
but California has between one
thousand and fifteen hundred men
eligible to membership in San
Francisco. Stanford has, at the
outside, not more than three hun
dred and fifty. The average at
tendance at Stanford smokers has
been about seventy-five, and it is
thought that this is the probable
limit of membership in the club.
It is regarded as questionable
whether so limited a membership
will be able to keep the club in a
prosperous condition.
