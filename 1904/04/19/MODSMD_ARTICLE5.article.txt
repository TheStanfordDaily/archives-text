# HISTORY MEN ORGANIZE.
## Pacific Coast Branch of American Historical Association Formed. 
### 
The Pacific Coast Branch of the
American Historical Association
was organized last Saturday, at a
meeting held at Mechanics' Insti
tute, San Francisco. About fifty
prominent history students were in
attendance, among them being
Professors Bernard Moses and
H. Morse Stephens of the Univer
sity of California, and Professors
Max Farrand, C. A. Duniway, and
A. B. Show of Stanford, and
Colonel Hubbard, secretary of the
California Historical Society.
The Pacific Coast branch is the
only offshoot of the national asso
ciation. The local charter was
granted at the annual meeting of
the American Historical Associa
tion held at New Orleans last De
cember.
Professor Farrand and Dr. Ste
phens gave addresses. Professor
Farrand outlined the work of the
national association, and Dr. Ste
phens discussed the purpose of the
local association and the work
which is to be done. The idea of
the association is not only to fur
ther historical research but also to
develop the social interests of its
members.
The following officers were elected
for the ensuing year: President,
Horace Davis, a member of the
Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity; vice-president, John T.
Doyle, a well-known member
of the San Francisco bar;
secretary-treasurer, Max Farrand,
Stanford; council, C. A. Duniway,
Stanford, H. Morse Stephens,
University of California, and R. D.
Hunt, San Jose high school.
